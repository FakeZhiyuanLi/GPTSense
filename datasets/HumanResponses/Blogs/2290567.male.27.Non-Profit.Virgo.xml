      So despite all of my reservations and anxieties, I have finally returned to NYC for the first time in four years. It took three flights and several screaming babies, but here I fucking am.  It’s a strange experience to travel so much while alone. I prefer to travel with a partner, like when I was with Jonathan in Spain and Mexico, or when I had that fucking brilliant trip to Pigport with Manny, Elray and the other Jonathan in January. Being with another person helps you remember the details, and it shapes your vision in a fuller way, I think. Plus, it’s rather sexy if you’re with the right person. Even your exhaustion becomes lovely.  But I was alone today. And slightly hungover from last night’s gin. I don’t remember much about my flight from Austin to Chicago, but I had an interesting time at O’Hare Airport. I’ve always liked that place. I laughed in condescension when I saw that there’s a place in the airport called ‘The Artists’ and Writers’ Bar.’ Like what do they have in the Artists’ and Writers’ Bar, I wondered. Barrels of gin? Opiates? Typewriters? Licensed psychotherapists? What bullshit.  But as it turns out, I have to give it up to the Artists’ and Writers’ Bar because I was desperately craving a Peach Snapple, and they were the only place that had one. For $2.81, I might add, but at least they had it.  There was also this really hot Spanish guy in the terminal near me. He was lying on the ground a few feet away from me, and I could see most of his chest and abs because of the weird angle at which he was lying. I didn’t mind so much when I noticed that our take-off was delayed.  I should add that I get rather emotional about trips and what it means to leave everything, even if it’s only for a few days. So it was strange when, on one of the flights, I put on the on-flight audio entertainment. One of the stations was playing all of Alanis Morrisette’s singles. For various reasons, the songs made me think of Manny, who seems incredibly far away right now. Well, I suppose he is – he’s in Texas, after all. I think about him a lot recently.   Anyway, these are details. Let’s get to New York. It’s very different. Granted, I’ve only been here a few hours so far, but it feels different. I still love it, of course. Maybe it’s me being old. Yvette said I looked like an adult today when I got to her apartment. That’s strange for me. I’ll think more about this when I’m not so tired.  We had dinner at this Indian restaurant called Milon in the Lower East Side. As soon as I walked in, I fucking fell in love with it. The whole place is maybe like 12 to 15 feet wide – you feel like you’re in a shoebox. But it’s also dim and lit with hundreds of hanging red lights. There are flowers, lights, decorations crawling up the walls and hanging from the ceiling. The walls are papered in something that looks like sexy gift wrapping. They play techno Hindu chanty shit. I felt like I was in a very happy dream. Definitely the best dinner I have had in a very very long time.   Anyway, this is getting long, and Jonathan’s wedding is tomorrow, so I’m going to chill with Yvette for a while and then go to sleep.

      Today I went to see an Off- Off-Broadway show called ‘Cardiac Arrest or Venus on a Half Clam.’ The show was pretty good – it was a one-man show starring a punk-rock drag queen named Taylor Mac. She performed these original songs and brief monologues about jacking off in the morning, gay marriage, hanky codes, sex in the back rooms of bars, and a failed relationship with Dick Cheney. Funny, out there, cool. It was a bit uneven, sure, but nicely done in general.  Afterward, we went to a cool French / Moroccan café called Gitane in SoHo. I had a mint tea and avocado on toast. Yums.  Earlier in the day, we had gone to a street festival hosted by Museo del Barrio and the Museum of the City of New York. Museo is like NY’s Mexic-Arte Museum, but it’s a little more Boricqua-focused. Museo, like Mexic-Arte, is in an old scary building, has very limited gallery space, and seems to get by on limited resources. The show, which was a bunch of 20th century Latin American works on loan from MoMA, was really good. They had Siqueiros, Kahlo, Orozco, O’Gorman, Basquiat, and some really cool Argentine works as well.  The Museum of the City of New York had a bunch of shit, but the best was this exhibition of really amazing photographs of NY street life from the past 50 years.  Last night, Yvette and her boyfriend and I had dinner at a really delicious Thai restaurant called Lime Leaf in Morningside Heights. Watched the Madonna interview on ABC, got psyched about tomorrow night’s show.  Madonna’s show is tomorrow night! I’m beginning to really feel it.  I’m too fucking exhausted to write much more right now. I’m not even going out tonight, I don’t think. But everything has continued to be 100% great.  Still thinking about everything. Yesterday I left a voice mail message which featured me singing at the top of my voice. I hope the boy who received it in Austin enjoyed it. I only have one full day and night left in the city. It’s beginning to feel more real that I have to go back soon. Real life should be avoided at all costs.  I’m trying to keep this out of my mind. The gin and the city really help quite a lot.

      I've been sitting around the apartment this afternoon, just reaing things and singing out loud and crying. Crying all the time. Thinking about Rufus Wainwright and Texas and this city and my heart and my pants and what I want and what I can't have and where I must go and everything else. Crying all the time because I feel so fucking good today.

      Oh, goddamn it – I feel so fucking great right now. Everything is right and nice. I just had a tongue sandwich from Hunter Deli, I woke up at 2:00 in the afternoon, I had a fun night. Everything just feels so goddamned perfect right now.  Okay. I decided last night that The Cock is my favorite gay bar ever. Yes, when I got there at midnight, there were only 8 other patrons at the bar (I counted). But by 1:00 or 1:30, it was completely crowded and fun. I met Paul and Siobhan, who were in town from Key West. They were both completely cool, and they kept buying me shots of Jager. We love them!!  Last night was The Cock’s 1970s night. Okay, so you know about my obsession with the 1970s. But The Cock isn’t so disco and dance oriented. They were playing mainly punk and some of the cooler rock from the decade. I loved it. When I walked in, they were playing ‘X Offender’ by Blondie:  “And at the trial you were there with Your badge and rubber boots I think all the time how I’m going to Perpetrate love with you  And when I get out, there’s no doubt I’m going to sex offense it with you!”  So I just struck a pose against a pillar and put my punk rock face on and sang along to the song. (Fortunately, I was dressed a little punk rock, so this all worked nicely.) Whenever anyone walked in, I gave them a scowl as if to say: “What the fuck are you doing here? This is my bar, kid.”  And this is part of why I love The Cock so much. It feels just like a gay bar might have felt before 1975. It appeals to my obsession with historical imagination. It’s punk rock. It’s like nothing that we have in Austin. It’s a little bit like some of the bars in San Francisco, but without the televised porn and cheese factor. It’s rather pure, cool, small, seedy, ironic, pure pure pure.  I worship The Cock. My rebel / criminal / Marianne Faithfull / downward spiral side is completely at home and at peace there. I can fuck the shit up.   So I got completely knackered. I don’t remember coming home on the 6 last night. (I really just wanted to type ‘On the 6’ so I could feel like J.Lo. – For those who don’t know, the 6 is the train that goes between the Bronx and way downtown. Jenny from the block is from the Bronx, hence her first album title.)  This is okay, but a little dangerous. I was, after all, alone. But no harm so far, so it’s okay. I did talk to Charlie last night, and he said he was going to see the cool band Franz Ferdinand at a place called APT. He invited me to stop by and have a drink with him. But I didn’t, mainly because I don’t want to look eager or uncool, but also because he thinks I live here in NY, and I don’t really want to deal with that topic. Anyway, I told him to give me a call during the weekend if he wants to hang out. We’ll see if he calls. I kind of don’t think he will.  I talked to Manny when I woke up this afternoon. I love talking to him. His voice is like a beautiful gin to me. I told him to go listen to the song ‘14th Street’ by Rufus Wainwright after work today. He said he might. If I could have one wish in the world right now, I would find a million dollars, stay in NY, and move Manny up here to have adventures with me every day.  He’s the best.  What else? I realized last night that I miss Elray. It just came to me out of nowhere while I was striking my punk rock pose at The Cock. I hope he’s doing well. He’d been having tough times when I left Austin. He’s really a beautiful and generous guy despite some of his flaws.  : )   I’m just being a dick with him; he knows I love him.  AGH!! I fucking love this city. It breaks my heart. I’m so full of something right now. I need a Peach Snapple.

      Hahahahahaha. No, really. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!  Okay, so yes, I admit it. I committed a minor crime in New York City today. But I can’t tell you what it was because I promised my accomplice that it would remain between us. Let me just say that when I made my escape, I ran out into the Chelsea streets, getting drenched by hard rains and running for my life. It was brilliant, and I got a nice high, and I loved it.  Ha-ha-ha.  The entire day has been fucking great. We went to several gallery shows. Saw an exhibition of Warhol polaroids at the Pace McGill Gallery, then saw a new Cindy Sherman show in Chelsea, then went to see a show called “The Mexican: Chelsea Remix.”  Next, I’m going to go out drinking tonight. There’s a small chance I might see that Charlie. We talked very briefly on the phone earlier.  I’m buzzy already. More later. Just say no!!

      Forgot to mention a really nice memory from Tuesday night: while walking across 14th Street on my way from Splash to the Cock, I burst into song. It was a warm, muggy time, like I mentioned, and I was getting buzzy, feeling light, happy to be so far from everything else. So I started singing the song ‘14th Street’ by Rufus Wainwright:  You’ve got my lost brother’s soul My dear mother’s eyes And brown horse’s mane, My uncle’s name. You walked me down 14th Street With a doctor to meet After thoughts of the grave In the home of the brave  And of the weak, but Why’d you have to break all my heart? Couldn’t you have saved a little bit of it…  Then, as I mentioned, I realized Manny had called, and so I called him back. The feeling of singing at the top of my voice and yet still not being heard by anyone was really lovely. So I dedicate my delighted and drunken performance of the song to Manny, since in a sense, he did walk me down 14th Street (and he does have my uncle’s name).

      Yesterday was my recovery day. I did nothing but watch television until about 5:00 PM, and then I went to meet Yvette and her boyfriend Scott for an exhibition opening at the AIGA Gallery (22nd and 5th). I actually enjoyed the show very much. It was called ‘Sensacional: Mexican Street Graphics.’ The gallery is pretty small, but they did a good job of decking it out with photographs and reproductions of graphics from advertisements, taco stands, comic books, etc. from Mexican street life. It was both funny and dirty, colorful and familiar.   After the opening, I met Atticus for dinner at a lovely restaurant called Cafeteria. Atticus is a boy I had a crush on in like 1874. It was nice to see him after about 2 or 3 years. He says he misses Austin sometimes. I think he should drink more.  After that, I just came back to the apartment and chilled out all night. Had a banana split. Nothing too exciting.  I’m not sure what I’ll do today. I might go to the Brooklyn Museum because I think they’ve redone their façade, and they also have a bunch of Rodin sculptures. I’ll probably go out to some gay bar tonight, too.  Not sure if I should call that Charlie guy. He was really cute, and like I wrote yesterday, I definitely enjoyed his company. But, you know, I’ll be gone in a matter of days. Is it even worth the effort?  I’ve also been a little bit down as the week has progressed. I’m just beginning to get that awareness that I have to go back to Texas soon. That all this is fantasy. And it makes me reconsider everything I’ve done since college. Have the past 6 years been a mistake? Am I wasting my time? Why haven’t I done anything worthwhile? How can I find the money to change things in life? Etc. etc. etc.  Madonna gave her first NY concert last night. How exciting is that? I am going to see her on Sunday. I want it to come as quickly as possible, but I don’t want it to come because I fly back to Texas the next day. Maybe I should try to let Charlie get me pregnant. Then I’ll have to stay here, and he’ll have to give me all his money.  That is the plan.

      How is it that smoking is not allowed in NY bars, but my clothes still smell of cigarettes when I wake up in the morning? Can someone explain this to me please?  Maybe this is psychological. I haven’t had a cigarette in 86 hours.   Okay, so last night I went to two bars: Splash (or SBNY) and back to the Cock. Splash is more like what I am used to. Pounding techno, dick dancers, occasional drugs in the bathroom, colourful lights. But this doesn’t mean I liked it all that much. It was okay. Splash just seemed like every other fag bar I’ve been to everywhere else in the world. As I began getting tipsy, I even started thinking that I was seeing faces from back home in the crowd. Hmmm.  At about midnight, I decided to trek on back to the Cock. It’s not a short walk, maybe 20-25 minutes. But it was fun to just be alone in the muggy night, passing fags at the Chelsea Hotel, passing garbage on the sidewalk, passing the cheesy kids making out in Union Square, passing the same buildings I’d passed the night before.  A couple of blocks away from the Cock, I noticed that Manny had called, so I called him back. He sounded like he was going through some unpleasant shit. But it was great to hear his voice, as it always is. And we talked for awhile, and it was the way it always is – fun, warm, full of laughter. But then he said something that hurt me a bit – he said that he had recently found similarities between me and his ex-boyfriend Ernest.  Now, look. I’m a nice guy. I really am. Sure, I can be judgmental and bitchy. But in matters that count, I am actually really very nice. And I will admit that I’ve only met Ernest once, and it was very much in passing. But despite all of this, I have to argue that any similarities there may be between us are overshadowed by some really major differences, especially pertaining to our relationships with Manny.  Let’s examine.   Actually, let’s not. I just wrote about how nice I am, and now I’m going to prove it. As Destiny’s Child once sang: “I’m not gonna dis you on the internet ‘cause my momma taught me better than that.”  One last thing I’ll say about this, though: it also stings to be compared to Ernest because what it says to me is that he just was luckier, had better timing, was more blessed by the gods than I was in this matter. I’ve never had the luxury of being in a relationship with Manny for two years, you know. And that kind of hurts. Because I would have done it differently (ahem, better). You know, my love is pure. My shit's the shit. My head don't fall off, fools. Welcome to life.  Enough of that. It’s like Madonna in ‘Truth or Dare’ – she didn’t allow business meetings to be shot for the film, and I’m going to have to consider my Manny storyline in the same way. ‘Get out! You can’t film me getting an adjustment. Shut up, Julie. Don’t tell me to tune it out.’  Um, so okay. I got off the phone and went into the bar. I spotted this hot guy sitting against the wall, so I kind of sat near him and cast my glances his way. He was short, nicely built, smart-looking (baseball cap and black glasses), pretty face with some stubble, olive-colored skin. Basically, he was hot.  Now, like I said, I’m a nice guy. Full of humility. Not so full of grace. So I couldn’t tell if he was into me or not. Then, about an hour later, I kind of followed him to another part of the bar and stood near him. Then we kind of got closer. And then closer. Finally, it was obvious that we were trying to meet, so I just started talking to him: “Where’s your hat?” (He had removed his hat and glasses by this point.)  He pulled his hat out of a bag he was carrying and showed it to me. I took it from his hands, put it on my head and walked away. To pee. Part of me wanted to just go home after that and keep his hat as a souvenir that represented all the fags in NYC. But I thought the guy (whose name is Charlie) was too cute for a game like that, in which only my wit can declare itself a winner.  I went back to him and struck up a conversation. And it turns out he’s really fucking cool! I’m Princeton class of 1998, he’s Harvard class of 1997. (Did I really just type that sentence? How, um, wrong.) He’s funny, he’s smart, he’s cool. Just cool. So we hang all night. We kind of brush up against each other – it’s nice, and the immediate future is looking pretty happy.  Then, we kind of lost each other at one point. Bummer! So what do I do? Go into the back room to watch the fags having sex. That was really kind of funny / odd / occasionally hot. One guy, for example, was walking in all slinky-like, trying to be sexy. Which might have worked, except for the fact he completely tripped and fell on his face in front of a bunch of people sucking cock. Score!  So I’m sitting there, watching people suck and get sucked, trying to decide whether I think it’s hot or not. And I look to my left, and who is sitting right next to me? Charlie. Doing the same thing. Watching. His cock is in his pants. He’s not participating. He’s just sitting there, squinting, trying to watch the action in the dark.  ‘Hey, I’ve been looking for you,’ I say. Because I’m so damned original!  ‘Me too,’ he says.  So we sit there and watch the fags in action. We touch each other’s arms and legs. We chat at a low and sexy whisper.   Finally, I say, ‘I really want to kiss you, but there’s too much gin on my breath. Guess you’ll have to wait.’  ‘No I won’t.’ And he picks up his bag and takes out breath mints. I down like 5 of them quickly, then I grab him by the jaw, turn his face toward me and slowly move in. I am kissing a wonderfully sexy guy in New York with fags getting it on all around me. As I said earlier: Welcome to life!  Well, 4:00 AM came, and the bar was closing. He walked me to the subway, we had a little kiss and said goodbye. I thought that was the end. Then, as I’m turning away to go home, he stops me: ‘Uh, do you have a cell phone?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘I want to give you my number. Call me.’

      Another great day. Yvette and I had a late start after our time at the Cock last night. We decided to start out slowly and catch a movie. While having a giant rare diner cheeseburger, we looked through the listings for something that sounded good and might not be showing in Texas.  We definitely found a great one: “Love Me If You Dare.”  Before I start about the movie, though, I want to say with lots of excitement that we saw Hulk Hogan at the concession stand of the movie theater. He was there with a boy of about 12 years who appeared to be his son. They went to watch ‘Garfield,’ which I find rather hilarious.  So ‘Love Me If You Dare.’ It’s a great fucking movie. It follows these two people as they grow up and play a dare game with each other throughout life. Obviously, they fall in love, but not until after they almost ruin (or end) each other’s lives several times. And I love the movie’s end, the way they decide to ‘preserve’ their love and express it permanently. I’ve read some comparisons between this movie and ‘Amelie,’ but this one is so much better.  After the film, we went downtown to look for an exhibition called ‘Flesh.’ It sounded really beautiful and interesting, but when we got to the address that’s posted on their publicity, there was a business called ‘Roman Textiles’ there. No gallery, no exhibition. Quite perplexing.  We walked toward Chinatown, which was nice despite the muggy weather. Did lots of window shopping and gawking at people. Went to the legendary Wo-Hop restaurant, which was very fulfilling for me. Morgan, you see, has a tee-shirt from Wo-Hop, and it has inspired us to invent a little holler that we do (in a high pitched voice): “Woooooooohh – HOP!” I bought my own Wo-Hop tee-shirt, which is actually cooler than hers because it’s black.  I also saw a barber shop called Mei Dick. Hee-hee.  Right now, Yvette and I are relaxing after spending hours on our feet.  I forgot to finish my thoughts on the Cock and Dick’s last night. To be brief, the Cock was far less scandalous than I had been lead to believe. Everyone I know who has been there always says that there are cocks aplenty and lots of illicit activity taking place. Well, while I was there, it was just a big bunch of guys standing around and listening to music from the Hives and Nirvana. I mean, I had a good time there, but I wanted to walk out of there feeling scared or dirty or…anything really powerful. Oh, and a gin and tonic there is $6. Not terribly expensive, but still quite a shock to my Charlie’s-Austin spending habits.  Dick’s was empty, had an ugly bartender, and featured maybe 3 bar patrons whose combined age was higher than their average SAT scores, for sure. So, in other words, it was just like the Dick’s back home in Austin!  Not sure what I’m going to do tonight. I am probably going to go out for a drink again and continue my exploration of the New York gay bars. This time I’ll be alone, though, since Yvette has to go to work early in the morning. We’ll see how much I’ve really aged – if I mainly feel like a hermit or a misanthrope and just sit in a corner drinking my gin, that will be pretty sad.

      So I spent most of the day alone. I didn’t have much of a plan, so I just got on the train and went looking for some old haunts. Went down around the Union Square area, then got back on the train and went for old Christopher Street. I’m a sucker for this kind of shit. Gay history. Buildings with new skins. Something historical turned into retail and profit. Hey – it’s great to be gay!!  Yvette and I did end up going to that series of short films. It was actually a great experience for me. They showed the in a café in Spanish Harlem. First of all, we had dinner at a place called La Fonda Boricqua (!!), which was all great and shit except for the fact that they had no menus and the first 3 things I ordered were all out. The waitress was really charming, though, in her sincere sense of apology and really strange way of communicating what might actually be available for consumption.  When we finally got to Carlito’s Café (the place hosting the film screening), we were all fucking delighted by the first short – a mock music video about the Virgen de Guadalupe and Juan Diego set to the music of J.Lo.’s “Jenny from the Block.” I’m going to say nothing more about it, because it was really too clever for my present words typed in a semi-drunken state.  After that, we came back to the apartment and chilled for awhile. Then around 11;45 or so, we finally motivated to go to some gay bars: the Cock and Dick’s. Now, I’ve heard a lot about the Cock. I was really intrigued. I was even thrilled.  But now I’m tired, and I’ll continue this story tomorrow.

      I knew this problem was going to happen when I got to NYC but I was allowing myself a comfortable denial.   It's the fucking cigarettes. They're like $7 a pack, minimum. I'm not going to fucking pay that shit!  So now I'm going through a really difficult withdrawal that I didn't intend. The last cigarette I had was about 39 hours ago. My head is a little wobbly.  I'm trying to figure out what to do with my afternoon. Since I'm an adult now, as Yvette has noticed, I'm much less inclined to do something dirty or scandalous. You know, if I were 19 or 24 or whatever, I might force myself into a porn theater for the fun of it. Or I might try to score a minor ('minor' as in nothing serious performed, not as in the age of the guy) trick.   But all that's old hat. I'd rather take a nap than do any of that.  Plus, I'm probably such a nicotine-deprived bitch right now that I'd scare any sexiness away. More later.

      Puerto Rican! I forgot to mention that the Puerto Rican Pride Parade was also today. I didn't participate because I was on Long Isalnd for the wedding, but I did see lots of Boricqua in the trains and on the streets. So if you see anyone from La Isla Bonita, please squeeze them in a place that matters. Ay, papi, pero como!

      If you know me, you know how much I love the Jews. Especially the Sephardim. But after today, my love for the Jews is something entirely different. I feel as though I have been changed forever, circumcised anew, chosen once again for the very first time. I am, in short, a Jew on his first steps upon the planet.  Jonathan Foer and Nicole Krauss got married today. This is Jonathan, the guy who’s known me for seven years in ways I both fear and cherish. Jonathan, the little man-boy whose laugh reveals a delightful and intentional childishness.  Jonathan, whose miniature hands have made a million pretty things. Jonathan, whose head is too big for the rest of his body. Jonathan, whose language is spoken outside of the mouth. Jonathan, the magician’s rabbit pulled out of an anonymous hat. Jonathan, who gets struck by lovely lightning every day.  And Nicole, who is even better than all of that.  Needless to say, everything about the wedding was incredibly gorgeous – from the Krauss estate in Long Island to Jonathan’s pure white satin-and-cotton suit to the reckless and blissful dancing.   They’d hired buses to pick us up at 41st and Madison. I arrived about half an hour early and ran into an old college friend named Julian Kreimer. This was a lucky turn, since I assumed I wouldn’t know anyone at the wedding and I would be forced to watch the whole thing alone and in silence. Talking to Julian was very strange – he was one of the very first people I met at Princeton (in fact, I met him the day I arrived), so he saw me go through lots of changes and crushes and drunken adventures over a period of four years.   But it was strange because it was such an odd reminder of how all those people I used to know so well have disappeared from my mind but not from the planet. So-and-so who was so cool and into architecture is now a stockbroker and living the model yuppie life. This other friend who used to be a drinking buddy got married a year ago, and I had no idea at all. That poet girl I used to consider my competitor went to Iowa but ended up in a bad way after that. As for Julian, he’s been painting and now he’s teaching at RISD.   Anyway, that’s how it was. I hooked up with several people at the wedding I hadn’t seen in ages. Some of them went to school with me, but I’d never actually met them. Some of them remember me or my poems, though I have no idea who they are. It’s all kind of funny. Jonathan’s friend Itamar has become incredibly sexy and now writes plays that get produced in places like Philadelphia and Milwaukee. Karen Emmerich has become very personable and is traveling to Turkey tomorrow morning. That Rachel girl – I’d heard so much about her but never met her – we talked a lot, and it was like being with an old sweet friend.  But back to the wedding. The actual ceremony was beautiful and really quite moving. I can’t remember the name of the cloth that hangs above the bride and the groom in a Jewish wedding, but this one was lovely. Apparently Nicole’s mother got it in Jerusalem and Jonathan’s mother embroidered their names on it in Hebrew. They also attached pieces of their own two wedding veils onto the cloth. I also loved the part of the ceremony where Nicole had to walk around Jonathan seven times to honor the Kabbalistic importance of the number.  But the most profoundly moving part of the ceremony came when the rabbi read to the audience excerpts from letters that Jonathan and Nicole had written to each other during their engagement. Jonathan and Nicole actually had no idea he was going to do this, by the way. But these letters were so gorgeous in their humility and in their completely nude sense of love. Of course we had to cry.   After this, we all separated and headed into the further reaches of the vast lawn, where there were daiquiris, margaritas and mixed drinks for all. Plus several sushi bars and attendants with hors d’ouevres.  Then, my favorite part of the whole day: the goddamned crazy blissful Jewish dancing. You’ve seen it before. Everybody locks arms and begins skipping in a large circle. The steps get faster, men begin to sweat and women laugh hysterically. People break off into couples and lock their arms again and spin as fast as they can. Accidents and minor bloodshed follow. It’s fucking beautiful and crazy. As a matter of fact, I wonder why the Mexicans haven’t adopted this. It’s an entirely different expression of joy and delight, but I think it could suit us nicely.  Then the chairs. Jonathan is placed in one, Nicole in another. They are carried on the shoulders of family and raised higher and higher. Then they kind of say ‘fuck the chairs,’ and they just start tossing Jonathan (who is now in a horizontal position) up into the air like a dwarf in a blanket.    Its all so crazy and full of unfiltered happiness. Which is odd for me, because in the rare times when I feel rewarded by love or blissful about a relationship, it’s usually a subtle and inward joy. I don’t go tossing myself up into the sky. I think I would like it very much, though. I do think I would.  Ah, what else? I’m getting long here, but there was just so much beauty in the day. At my dinner table, I sat with The Mister Paul Auster, who is very sexy actually despite the fact he wore black jeans with his suit. I also sat with Eric Chinsky, Jonathan’s former editor. Eric’s girlfriend and I really hit it off. Her name is Cherry, and she is a Filipina who does some kind of work for film and television. She’s worked on several of Todd Solondz’s movies, and she says they just finished a new one. What I learned about his new flick: it has lots of underage sex.   Nathan Englander and the scandalous Jonathan Franzen were also at the wedding. Nathan has cut his long hair and looks much much better. Okay, I’ll admit it: he actually looks hot. Jonathan Franzen, well, you know. At least he has his success.   Overall, the wedding was even more perfect than I thought it would be. The feeling seemed to be shared by everyone, too. Over and over I heard about how ideal Jonathan and Nicole are for each other. We all traded stories about experiences we’ve had with them. We laughed at them, and we slapped them around just a little. There’s nothing better than this kind of day, I think. The only thing better would have to involve being one of the two people getting married.  Which leads me back to the inevitable: myself. There is a part of me that experiences this with sadness for the obvious reason – I will never have this in my own life. And not just because of the laws of my state or the threat of some constitutional amendment. But because we’ve had to learn a different form of love. Not one that is inferior or diminished, I don’t think. But one that is most certainly different. In the event that someday I am able to marry a man that I love, I can’t imagine the expression of it being anything like what I saw today. My father is not going to thank my guy for being so ideal. My mother is not going to go crazy dancing and crying her eyes out. I am not going to be part of a tradition of thousands of years.  But perhaps I’m looking at this the wrong way. Maybe the people who will be there – whoever they are – will regard us with a more profound admiration for the strength I imagine it would take to marry. Maybe there are delights and pleasures I can’t even recognize yet. Things that come as rewards for having the bravery to accept love when it appears and not belittle it or fear it or flee from it like so many gay men that I’ve known.  Learn a fucking lesson, fags. That’s all I have to say about that.  Anyway, I’m too young tonight to get all lonely and full of future remorse. I thought I might go out for a drink tonight, but it’s getting a little late. Tomorrow will be fun – Yvette’s taking me to some screening of short films from Latin America, I think.

      Okay, I have a few minutes to write about the point and the purpose I’d mentioned a few days ago. The reasons why I am a rebel and a fucker-up-of-shit.  I want to fuck the shit up because it’s ridiculous in the gay world. True, there’s a lot to love about being a fag – we’re definitely smarter and more fun than your average straight guy, for sure. But there’s a lot of shit to deal with, and so I’m going to fuck with it – and hard. Let’s start with the obvious: the conservatives are trying to pass an amendment to the Constitution outlawing the rights of gay people to marry each other. Okay. This is just the latest in a long history of incredible stupidity and bigotry. These are the people who might smile when they hear the story of the guy who punched me in the face in downtown Austin while calling me a fag. The compassionate conservatives.  Even more fucked up than this, though, is the fact that despite the cruelty of the bad straight people, nobody has done more damage to the gays than the gays themselves. We treat each other far too often with cruelty, insecurity, stupidity and irresponsibility. And it’s always so laughably transparent.  And so what - we have these fags running around town getting drunk, snorting their coke, fucking and sucking and whatever else they want to do in complete and concealed loneliness. And they think they’re the hot shit. They think they are the rebels, that they are fucking the shit up. The funny thing is, of course, that they’re just full of shit. There is nothing rebellious about standing in a gay bar with your bitchiest face and darting off to the bathroom to snort a bump and messing around with some guy you just met in a bar. This is so easy! We’ve all done it, we all do it. It’s like brushing your teeth. Way to fuck the shit up, fags.  The most rebellious thing you can do as a gay man in 2004 is this: love another man. Purely. Without secret motives. Without self-hatred. Without running from it. And this belief is what makes me a rebel and a true punk and a bad-ass motherfucker. The day I kiss the guy I love and he kisses me with an equal passion, I say fuck you to the retail fags in the bars. I say fuck you to the Republicans. I say fuck you to the guy who struck me in the face. And I say fuck you to whoever else has anything to say about it.   Tomorrow is gay pride day across the country. Pray to gay Jesus for all the fags you know. They’re very likely to be wonderful people. And drink your goddamned gin. And fuck the shit up.

      Last night I had drinks with Manny. First we went to Light, whose happy hour I love because it’s always empty and you can sit in the massage chairs for as long as you want. The music was a bit loud, though, so we went to the B-Side afterward. Had a lot of conversation, all very honest and pure.  One part of the conversation was focused on Manny’s insistence that I be more active when it comes to writing. He apparently thinks that I’m depriving the world and the gay people of some sort of service that I owe them. But, I said, the gay world is also depriving me of a very specific service that it owes me. So until the fags make an offer I like, I’m gonna keep things where they’re at. This, however, was just an excuse to keep me from having to admit a very simple truth that Manny has been brave enough to call out: no matter for what reason or for whom, I really should be writing with some discipline.   I am writing a play. I haven’t worked on it in over a month, but I haven’t declared it dead, either. The play is about these gay guys in 1980. Right at the death of disco and the birth of AIDS. It’s a comedy, and it’s very disco-centric. The storyline centers on one of the characters’ desire to find gay justice for himself and his friends. And to keep his love relationship viable. The things I’ve had in my head while writing it are Three’s Company, John Waters and – to a very limited extent – Pedro Almodovar. I don’t have a title for the play yet, but I had to put something on page one, so right now it’s ‘Hot Pink Disco Trash.’  We’ll see where that ends up.  The rest of my conversation with Manny was mainly about our relationship. And that’s not something I want to post on a blog. Like Madonna with her business meetings, remember?

      I found this  urlLink website  with pics of Elijah Wood starring as Jonathan Foer in the film version of 'Everything is Illuminated.' (Go to 'gallery,' then click on 'on set.')  Wow. I knew Jonathan during the period when this action is supposed to take place, and he didn't look anything like that. He would never let himself look so incredibly nerdy.  I'm smiling nervously like a person does when he doesn't get a joke but tries to play along. This is the  urlLink Jonathan I know. Or  urlLink this one .

      So I know this guy who is beautiful and amazing. Maybe I've mentioned him before. Anyway, we talked on the phone for a long time last night, and I love talking to him. His voice is lovely, you know?  He told me once that it's an online tradition for new bloggers to list 100 things about themselves on their blog. He began to do it once, but I don't think he finished (I don't read his blog for deeply personal reasons). Since he didn't finish, and since he's on my mind all the time, I thought I'd help him out.   Here are 50 things about this guy I know:  01. His voice is like a beautiful gin. 02. His laughter is the tonic. 03. He does a good dance impersonation of The Jets. 04. He knows how to make peach yogurt taste even more delicious. 05. The most beautiful thing I’ve seen is his face when he cries. 06. He’s smarter than he thinks he is. 07. He takes Excedrin all the time. 08. He deserves better than he allows himself to have. 09. He’s a former Marine. 10. He has a son named Nicholas who is hopefully playing Candyland way too much. 11. He’s never been to New York. 12. He’s not in his twenties anymore. 13. He makes me feel more like myself than anyone else I know. 14. He loves Madonna almost as much as I do. 15. He likes Dominick Dunne. 16. He likes a band called Frou Frou. 17. He thinks I’ve been pampered in my upbringing. 18. He sings The Cure at Karaoke. 19. I named my sofa after him. 20. I think he is the ideal guy for me, even if I can not have him. 21. He’s apparently always at Oilcan Harry’s. 22. He watches Everwood on the WB. 23. He makes me want to be a true punk and a bad-ass motherfucker. 24. He used to wet his lips very quickly before kissing me. Every time. 25. He’s from Lake Jackson, Texas, home of Selena and my most retarded relatives. 26. He and I have cried together a million times. 27. He is the reason I started a weblog. 28. He has made me love the phrase ‘deserted island.’ 29. He makes me laugh more than anyone else. 30. He wears glasses sometimes. 31. I didn’t pay very much attention to him the first time I met him. 32. He’s looking for a new apartment. 33. He doesn’t like to be complimented. 34. When he ended our relationship, he sent back my belongings but I kept all of his. 35. His skin feels surprisingly silky. 36. He always fans his burps away. 37. He is the voice of reason when I freak out, as rebels often do. 38. Whenever I feel moved or really terribly excited, I always want to share it with him. 39. He is so unabashedly sweet to everybody around him. 40. He believes and encourages my act. 41. He humors me by playing games with me. 42. He is always trying to learn new things. 43. He inspired me to write a poem called ‘The Delicate Things Shall Persist.’ 44. He taught me how to two-step. 45. The song that reminds me of him is ‘La Negra Tiene Tumbao’ by Celia Cruz. Or anything by Alanis. 46. We have way too many inside jokes. 47. I’ve got something for his face, motherfucker. 48. You see? 49. I love him forever and ever. 50 And ever and ever and ever.

      Back in the ATX after the worst travel experience I've had in my life. I don't want to go into details.  Point of this post is this: I'm continuing this silly blog. I know that only like 2 people ever read it (me and Manny...well, sometimes Russell), but the shit is addictive. I am a true punk and a fucker-up-of-shit, and I'm going to try to make that the focus of my little online journal from now on.  Mind you, I'm very serious about being a rebel and a bad-ass motherfucker. But my definitions of these terms are not the typical bad-boy bullshit. I have a point. And a purpose. And I'll tell you about them later.

      Last post. But I have to mention this. After the concert, I went out drinking at the Phoenix with Yvette. We were still on a high, though a bit deflated after sitting through an hour-long subway delay. Anyway, after that, Yvette headed home and I went to give my last regards to the Cock. They were playing a lot of disco from the 1970s, and it was incredibly packed, so I danced a lot and got really gross and sweaty. I had to – it was my last night in the city.  Anyway, when 4:00 AM rolled around, I decided to take a cab instead of the train. So there we are, barreling down 3d Av. And every red light is turning green right as we get there. We’re flying. Then – check this shit – the next light doesn’t turn green. And there’s another car that has the right of way, and he’s barreling in his direction. And for a split second, I think: ‘It’s okay. This guy’s a cab driver. He knows how to do this. We’ll be fine.’ And I hear that revolting sound of metal and glass crushing and falling onto the street. We’ve collided.  I freaked out. ‘Are you okay?’ I ask the driver. And the other driver is out o his car, screaming at us. I see the major damage to his car. I wonder if I should get out and find another cab…or would I have to wait for cops and give them testimony…or would I…and then my driver just takes off, speeds into side streets, makes his escape and takes me home. Wow. But I made it, and he didn’t charge me a penny.  What a way to end my trip. It’s perfect and dark. I’m not going to say anything else because all of my cheese and sentimentality is obvious, so I’ll just see you in Austin, fuckers.

      Ooh, that fucking bitch. That middle-aged cunt. Yeah, I said the unsayable: middle aged. Oh, and I also said the c-word. But that’s what she is, and you know what? I love her.  After all this waiting, Yvette and I finally got to see the Re-Invention tour at MSG. First off, let me say that going to a Madonna concert is like going to the biggest gay bar on the planet. Fags of all types, sizes, colors, swish levels. It’s hilarious.  But fuck the fags. We’re here for Madonna. The show started about 40 minutes after the posted time, which I expected. The stadium gets dark, and these huge video screens start showing really cool images from that exhibition she did with Steven Klein called “X-Static Process.” Lyrics and heavy sexy beats from the “The Beast Within” are playing, which is really fucking cool and approachable. Now, we had a side view, so we could see Madonna getting into place behind the very cool screens. Through the binoculars, Yvette said that she smiled very humbly when she heard the audience roar at the start of the images. I love that little detail.  Anyway, Madonna comes up in the middle of the stage on this rising platform, the fags are creaming their pants, and she looks fucking hot. Then the words: ‘Strike a pose.’ And she does. But it’s a a yoga pose, not a vogue pose. Then another. She is amazing. And this is the first of the little reinventions and reinterpretations we see throughout the night. 1990 Madonna meeting 1998 Madonna. It’s fucking hot, the dancers are great, she is getting everyone – everyone – up on their feet and dancing.  Okay, so I’ll have to get more general because I don’t have a lot of time to write. But she danced her shit off in ‘Nobody Knows Me,’ next, then stood and sang ‘Frozen’ very gracefully in front of some really beautiful images. There were some definite surprises: ‘Deeper and Deeper’ was slow and jazzy, almost like the original version of ‘Fever.’ ‘American Life’ was brilliant with the nuns and the bombs and the kids and the destruction and the military shit. ‘Burning Up’ – what else do I need to say?  I know I can sit here and gush, so I’ll switch gears and list my very few criticisms of the show: 1) The choreography in ‘Don’t Tell me’ was exactly the same as it was in the Drowned World Tour, 2) Um, I forgot the other one. Seriously. That’s how much I dug last night.  To wrap up, most of what you’ve heard is true. She dances much more than she has in a while. She does songs she hasn’t done in many, many years. It’s a definite crowd pleaser. Her voice sounds incredible, particularly during ‘Lament’ from Evita and ‘Crazy for You.’   As for me, my legs are sore today from all the jumping and dancing. I had an incredible time. I was screaming, dancing, crying, all of everything. Brilliant. Yes, it was better than Drowned World Tour, and yes she still fucking kicks your ass.

      I’m a little worn out, but I do have a bit of time to write some thoughts down on the gay bars. The short version is that I love gay bars. I think that they are the most important spaces that gay men socially share. Indeed, for a lot of gay men, they are the only common space to be shared.   Of course, though, things are little bit more complicated than that. I love gay bars, but I don’t love them equally. Some are horrid. Some stink of pretense and self-destruction. The all-time best gay bar I’ve ever been to is  urlLink The Cock  in NYC. It appeals to different parts of me: the kid who just wants to dance sometimes, the punk who wants to stand against the wall and scowl at people, the horndog who wants to see people get dirty, the nice boy who wants to have a conversation, the drunkard who wants another goddamned gin.  As a single 27-year-old guy going through life and trying to make sense of everything, I feel something like an obligation to go out to the bars and to go often. With friends or alone. Part of my attraction to bars has nothing to do with gay people or community or social shit – fact is, I like to drink. I really really like it. So let’s just start with that: I want to go to bars so that I can drink my gin.  But there is the other part: the bars are the place where I see a bunch of gay faces. Where people live out a big part of their private lives. Where people come looking for really important things. And sometimes where they find them. Not to be too obvious, but I feel that gay bars serve a lot of the purposes that the church did in earlier society.  The downside, of course, is that despite all of this, the bars are completely artificial environments. People are not themselves in the bars. And you always hear that sentence: ‘You’re never going to find your boyfriend at the bar.’ I don’t necessarily believe that. Mainly because I go to bars, and I think that my head’s on straight and I’ve been a really good boyfriend in the past, so if I’m there, why can’t another good person be there?    Then there are the bartenders. The people we pay to flirt with us, take off their shirts sometimes, listen to our life stories, and of course, provide us with the gin. I love bartenders when they’re good. Continuing my comparison between gay bars and churches, I have to say that the bartenders are like priests. They counsel and serve continually. And have sex with other men.  So of course, I’ve had crushes on many bartenders in the past. There was that really cute one who worked at JR’s in Houston in 2002, for instance. He gave me his number, and I was totally smitten with him, and I called him and found out he lived with his mother. There was that one who I met on his first night working at Oilcan Harry’s like in 2000 or something. He was always incredibly sweet to me, and he helped me quit smoking and I sometimes would leave him a 100% tip, no matter how high my bill was. He still works there, but I think he’s been a little corrupted by the lifestyle, and we don’t bond the way we used to. Then there was Aesop at The Forum. I didn’t really have a crush on him, but there was a little something about him I liked for some reason. And he’s also truly nice – he burned a CD for me once with a bunch of cool club songs on it. Oooh, then there was that guy at 1920s earlier this year. I’m totally blanking out on his name, but oh shit, he totally melted me. He was this beautiful Turkish guy who was really humble and read good books and would talk to me for long periods at a time. I wanted him like baaad. And then there was Rand at Charlie’s, who was just yummy. And Bobby, who is still at Charlie’s and has the most beautiful ass I’ve ever seen. And Carl at Charlie’s. I don’t have a crush on him, but he definitely wins the award for lifetime achievement. He is the best, friendliest, most human bartender, full stop.   So here are the gay bars in Austin and what I think about them:   urlLink 1920s Club -  One of my favorites. It’s a well-kept place on Congress that has really bad paintings of figures from the mob era. Farhad the owner is always standing behind the bar, usually doing absolutely nothing. The drinks aren’t cheap, though. It’s usually completely empty at happy hour, which I dig. The best thing about the bar is the fucking atmosphere. You can have a conversation and hear every word of it. Most of the negative aspects of gay bars – the bitchiness, the drugs, the blatant cruising – are thankfully absent at 1920s. It’s a good place for a date or to bond with someone you like. And I’ve had some pretty significant experiences there: this is the place where I basically got dumped, where I’ve admitted a crush to someone, where I’ve had a great fucking time every now and again.  ‘Bout Time – Russell and I used to go there a lot before September 11, 2001. They had karaoke every week with Murrah. Murrah is…like Delta Burke and Bette Midler in one body. After the terrorist attacks, the tone of the place got really creepy and chest-thumpingly patriotic. The place always was like the Twilight Zone, and it just lost its kitschy charm for me.   urlLink Boyz Cellar –  I rarely ever go to BC. The bartenders all work without shirts on, and some of them are cute. However, it’s an 18-and-up club, and the crowd just feels really too young for me. It’s also very white. But at least people go there now – it sucked big balls when it was The Edge.   urlLink Chain Drive –  The local leather bar, except that very few people wear leather there anymore. Chain Drive has gotten really tame lately. It seems like in the past, you could catch people blowing each other out on the patio or whatever. Nowadays, it mainly older bearish men and good drink specials on Thursday – or is it Friday?   urlLink Charlie’s –  They’ve started charging me rent. Charlie’s is my bar, my turf, my provider of really kick ass drink specials. There are some negatives. If you go too early, it’s fucking nursing home. There’s a lot of cocaine being snorted in the bathrooms. But the positives are there, too. The back bar (where my stool is) tends to play a lot of 70s and 80s stuff that I love, from Madonna to the Pointer Sisters. Plus, like I just mentioned, I pretty much have my own stool there. (Am I beginning to sound like Blanche Devereaux at the Rusty Anchor??) The regulars are pretty cool people: me, Russell, David the Dealer, Adam, Dee, Ben and Daniel, all of Russell’s Mexicans, older David, (okay, I’ll say it) Casey, whoever else the regulars are. It’s very unpretentious most of the time, there’s a diverse group of people who go, and Carl is the best bartender. The whole staff was named best bar staff in the city this past year by the Chronicle. That’s might be a bit of a stretch, but hey, they won.  Dick’s – Um, I don’t go there very often. It’s usually pretty empty when I go. But I do love their secluded back patio. I’d like to be naughty there someday.   urlLink Oilcan Harry’s –  Oh, Oilcan. The most visible and probably most popular gay bar in town. The first gay bar I ever visited in Austin. The place I have the most history with. You know, Oilcan Harry’s is not a bar that I like very much. It’s okay. I can have a good time there if I’m among friends. But I find it to be strangely soulless. I find the guys to be uninteresting. Every time I’m there, I feel like there was just a clearance sale at Abercrombie & Fitch. It all seems very attempted to me, like everyone’s trying to be a cookie-cutter fag. Plus, this is the gay bar that’s in every city in America. If you’ve been to a gay bar before, you’ve already been to Oilcan. There was a time when Oilcan was my main gay bar. And those were the days when I was profoundly unhappy in life. Not to overstate its importance, but I think that Oilcan was a part of that unhappiness. Like I was placing myself in this toxic environment that wasn’t giving me what I needed at all. I was at the Catholic Church instead of the Kabbalah Center. Every night was a cruel rejection, and I didn’t take it very well. So now I simply don’t go very often. I do have to say, of course, that there are exceptions. Not everyone there is an automaton. Manny goes there a lot, and so he proves me at least a little bit wrong. Plus, I did meet Russell there in like 1776.   urlLink Rainbow Cattle Company –  The gay cowboy bar. It’s a good place to take visitors from out of state, I guess. They have Latino night every Tuesday and Sunday. Two-dollar Dos Equis. Latino night used to be fun, but now it’s not. There are a lot of really sexy, sweaty, horny Latino boys dancing their butts off. But I don’t really fit in to that scene. It’s like I told someone recently, most of the people in gay bars are retarded, but these people are retarded in a different language!   urlLink Sidekicks –  This week, I’ve had a good time there. I usually don’t go, though. The nice things I’ll say about it are that it’s pretty damn big and their karaoke nights are pretty cool. It tends to be more lesbian than most other bars in town, which is good or bad depending on your outlook. They’ve hosted John Waters. It seems like the most wholesome bar to me.  This post has gotten really long, so I’m going to end it now. I’ll be at Charlie’s tonight.

      That Marlon Brando died today at the age of 80. I'm not sure why I care, but I kind of do. He was  urlLink beautiful  when he was young, and really fucking talented. No, urlLink  really .  urlLink Really . And if you've ever seen the film version of 'Streetcar Named Desire,' you'll always remember him yelling: 'Stellaaaaaaa!'  CNN says that a review of the stage version of 'Streetcar' wrote this: 'There had never been such a display of dangerous, brutal male beauty on an American stage - its influence can still be felt, in fashion photography and sport as well as acting.'  He did get grossly fat and strange. He started hanging out with Michael Jackson. His son killed someone, I think. And wasn't there a rumour that he owned a private island where he had sex with minors? I don't know. But he seems like a cool, sexy, masculine, talented guy. And he gets named by Madonna in 'Vogue,' so there you go.  Hope you're sexy again in heaven, Marlon Brando.

      Last night I went to Sidekicks to watch Kim participate in what I thought was going to be a wet tee-shirt contest. Instead it was a ‘best ass’ contest. Kim was all dressed up in her hootchiest shit, and she was wearing the same wig she wore when she competed in the karaoke contest at The Forum last summer, before I had actually met her (feels so goddamned long ago…). Needless to say, Kim tore up the competition and strutted off with the $100 grand prize.   The night kind of had a late start for me. When I got to the bar at 10, I was not having fun at all. I was still too involved in trying to recover from the drunkenness of the night before (see below). After a while, I even left the bar and walked to the Sonic next door and just sat on the hood of my car, all alone, eating my grilled cheese sandwich and tater tots and sweet tea. Now that’s a pretty pathetic sight: me alone in the parking lot of a gay bar at 11 at night munching down.  So I go back into the bar, still in a funky state. There’s a cute guy playing pool, and he keeps looking at me. Finally, he comes up and does the classic pick-up line: ‘Don’t I know you from somewhere? You look really familiar.’ And I’m all funky and bitchy, so I say: ‘Who  are  you?’ I didn’t mean to be so mean; it just came out that way. So he just kind of walked away. Later, he ended up hitting on Michael. So clearly, if that’s his taste, he wasn’t worth it in the first place. I’m just shitting on Michael because he was rubbing it in my face last night. Fucking hippie. Anyway, yeah, the guy wasn’t all that exciting after all, and he was wearing a ‘D.A.R.E. to Keep Kids Off Drugs,’ tee-shirt, which is such 1995 irony. Pre-Alanis irony. Just plain retardation.  Later, we switched over to the Xtreme side of the bar. (Typing that out felt really cheesy.) They had a male amateur strip contest. Mainly your typical shit, except that a couple of the competitors were really funny. Like this one guy crawled onto the stage and did some really weird ‘stages of life’ performance where he went from an infant to a toddler to … I don’t know, a really socially awkward skinny guy. And his mother was actually in the bar. The funniest part of the night for me, though, was my surprise when I saw that Contestant Number Four was none other than (drum roll, please) Casey.  It’s odd to see someone you know dancing on a stage, taking his clothes off, trying to play a certain role.   I’ve had a lot of sexual topics on my mind recently. I want to write a post about some of my thoughts on sex, but that has to be later. Maybe tomorrow. I also want to write a post about gay bars.   I need a haircut, because I have a habit of tying knots in the back of my head. This in itself is no problem, except that it leaves me with an Alfalfa cowlick all day. Not so hot.  Can’t wait for my post-workday nap.

      I feel like a boxer the morning after his fight. Or like my head is a bowling ball. Cause last night I got drunk. Not drunk, bitches, but DRUNK. Like a motherfucker.  By my estimation, I had between 15 and 20 beers. Now look. I’m a badass motherfucker, but nobody should be drinking that many beers. And they weren’t just regular beers. They were the cheap one dollar super heavy hangover beers. The kind that fuck you without a drop of lube.  So I wake up this morning grunting and moaning and groaning. I can’t get out of bed. I can’t do shit. Somehow I manage to shower. I’m trying to get myself to work. Then I fucking walk out of the apartment to go to work without a shirt on! This is how fucked I am today.  Driving in the car, I’m crying my eyes out listening to Rufus again. And I get to work, and I need help. I call Manny, and I give him my recurring demand: “Say something nice to me. Pleeeeeease.” And he says lovely things to me. Sugar. Honey. Strawberries. Clouds. Rainbow. Stars. Bunnies.   Thank you, Manny. I need all the sugar, honey, strawberries, clouds, rainbow, stars and bunnies I can get. My Launchcast is playing the Stones right now, so I do feel like I am recovering some of my badass motherfuckerness, but I know it’s going to be a long long day.

      I have the worst trouble getting out of bed in the morning, even when I have had a decent amount of sleep the night before. Yuck.  Last night I re-read the beginning of  urlLink 'The Book of Disquiet'  by Fernando Pessoa. I first read this book a little over 2 years ago after coming back from my trip to San Francisco. For some reason, though, it seems a little alien to me. Like I’m searching for pieces of myself in it that have faded.  And on the plane to New York earlier this month, I re-read  urlLink 'Letters to a Young Poet'   by Rilke. (That link allows you to read the whole book, which is really short. Letter 7 is the best.) One of the books I love the most. And I was really shocked to encounter all these old pieces of myself that have not faded at all. Rilke writing about love. A boy in his first loves in nothing less than the world’s fecundity. I think he said that, if I remember correctly. About how everything one experiences in life is nothing more than preparation for the experience of loving a person the right way. And about how young people fuck it up.   So I’ve been in love twice. The first began when I was 19, the other when I had just turned 27. Is a 19-year-old a boy in the same way that a 27-year-old is? Of course not. And how many experiences were there in the 8 years in between? And were they enough? What is any of this?  In the present, these answers don’t really matter. One should just live it and follow it and see where it takes you.  I continued work on my play last night. Wrote a scene that I actually like quite a lot. It’s a bit scandalous and dirty. And it involves something I would really love to do in real life.  urlLink

      Late Sunday night, and I am listening to the wonderfully sexy Alejandro Sanz. Coming down back into reality after another beautiful fantasy life weekend.  Manny and I drove down to Laredo for the weekend. It was sort of a why-not kind of trip. Nothing planned, no return date scheduled, etc. etc. And this is the way to do it, because I’ve learned over time that when I’m with Manny, it really doesn’t matter where we are or what we’re doing – we just always seem to have a really lovely time. So for the weekend, we decided to head down there and just see what would happen.  A lot happened. Fucking hilarious shit. Really wonderful shit. Like Friday evening, we went to dinner in Nuevo Laredo with my mom, my sister, Frank and Mark. Instead of going to the Eldorado like we usually do, we went to a place called El Rincon del Viejo. I was a little nervous that all of it would be overwhelming or a little uncomfortable for Manny – being with all these new people, being in Mexico, whatever. But it was great. The restaurant is quite nice, they have roving mariachi singers, really good little potato gorditas that you smear guac on top of, and – of course – tasty beverages. It was cool to introduce Manny to the pleasures of a michelada and the nice texture of cabrito. And it was just fun for me to try to see the place, the food, my family through his eyes for the first time. You know, as deeply as he knows me, being in my home and seeing me interact with my mother probably adds a rare level of understanding. And it’s cool that I want him to know it.  There was an automatic donkey ride that was put there for little kids – you know – the kind that you feed a quarter and ride for like 30 seconds. Manny and I decided that we had to be photographed atop the donkey, whom my sister named Fofo Chico. And this is the first of several things that I can’t really convey about the weekend. Most people probably wouldn’t understand why we felt like the coolest bitches on the planet while we were atop Fofo Chico. Or why we were peeing our pants when we went to a hardware store called Dr. Ike’s. Or why we couldn’t stop laughing at the idea we had to drive into Mexico backwards at top speed and continue our adventures. Even my sister looked at us like freaks when we decided to wear aprons all evening on Saturday even though it was Mark who was doing the cooking. We just sat there in the dining room drinking our cuba libres.  This is how it is with Manny. He turns me into a little kid sometimes with the cheesiest little adventures or jokes we make. And I love it. But he also gets my other big-boy shit. And he somehow feeds it, encourages it, and even validates it sometimes. Cool.  So I know there’s too much stuff to really write about, so I am going to use Manny’s habit of listing things that I don’t want to forget about this weekend:  The short shorts that went se…xy, se…xy. Ya tu sa, ya tu sa. Sa, sa, sa. Ya tu sa, ya tu sa. The dog and cat dance my sister taught us. Read in Mexican accent: “Blockbuster and Burger King.” Playing ‘guess which celebrity I am’ at the Eldorado on Saturday. The sunglasses and leather bracelet. The electricity guy at the bar on Friday night. The fucking crazy air mattress. The drag show that raised $25 for a friend in need. Dancing to that song Manny liked at the end of the night. Singing Rufus way too loudly on the way home. Giving Manny a Spanish lesson at the Discovery Bar. The amazing peach smoothie. The guy stroking his cock at Taco Palenque. Doing the pigeon dance as we drove down the highway.  I’m sure there are many other things I should be writing about the weekend, but I am beginning to fade out. It was just the kind of experience that should have no end. As I mentioned several days ago, reality should be avoided at all costs. Life would be perfect if I could just continue having these adventures and drinks and jokes and conversations with Manny and there were no real life to attend to. Someday, though, you will see us driving backwards in my Dodge Neon, and you’ll know that everything is perfect and right in life.

      I have this  urlLink boyfriend , you see, and I really love him. But he wants too much from me, and I don’t know if I can commit to  urlLink him  yet.  Part of the reason is because I also dig  urlLink another guy , and he’s incredibly talented. He writes beautiful music and he makes people cry. But I think he’s a bit too much of a  urlLink girly boy  for me.  Of course, when I travel in Europe, I go with  urlLink my consort . We don’t have much in common, but we have a delicious time.  But of all them men, I think I will settle down with  urlLink this one . He also writes beautiful music, and he’s  urlLink proudly romantic  and he has a sexy manly voice, and he is from Spain, and we love him.  If I can’t be with only one man, though I can assemble  urlLink a team .   Or I can take on a  urlLink whole   urlLink damn   urlLink army  (from Israel).

      I took a few minutes today to do a little research for my play. While googling around, I found the  urlLink article  that first broke the news to the world that AIDS existed. It's fascinating to read. The article, to my understanding, was buried deep inside the paper. I can't imagine being my own adult age at the time of its publication. I can't imagine how people felt on that day in July as they read the newspaper - they could have absolutely no idea of what this 'cancer' affecting 41 people would turn into.    From the article:  "Dr. Curran said there was no apparent danger to nonhomosexuals from contagion. 'The best evidence against contagion,' he said, 'is that no cases have been reported to date outside the homosexual community or in women'."    By the way, if you haven't read 'And the Band Played On' by Randy Shilts, do yourself the favor. It's excellent.

      Generally speaking, I am pretty glad that Senator Kerry has chosen Senator Edwards to be his running mate. I’ve never been particularly fond of or interested in Edwards, but he does seem to be the candidate that has energized people most effectively recently, and my sense is that Republicans seem to fear him most. So the choice seems wise and solid. I’m just glad that Senator Kerry- urlLink Addams  didn’t do something dumb like choose Dick Gephardt, which had been strongly rumoured and  urlLink believed  recently.   Still, I suspect that the  urlLink evil regime  will somehow manage to stay in power. It’s  urlLink close , they say, right now. I’m keeping my fingers crossed.  When I was having that  urlLink beer  with Adam on Monday, I didn’t just babble about naivete and the single life in the gay world. We also talked politics. We talked about how people just have some really odd things on their minds when they form decisions on whom to choose for the White House. Look. This is what the Austin American-Statesman wrote about Edwards this morning: “There is no question that Edwards is a man of the people; everything about him says ‘regular guy,’ someone you'd enjoy having over for a barbecue.”  First of all, I wouldn’t want John Edwards at  urlLink my barbecue . I get the feeling he wouldn’t  urlLink shut up . I want  urlLink John Waters  at my barbecue, you know? Or  urlLink Marianne Faithfull . I’d love to see her make a mess of herself, getting  urlLink sauce  all over her chin.   Besides, which part of John Edwards says ‘regular guy?’ Is it the vast and sprawling fortune? Is it the fact that he’s 51 but looks like he should be  urlLink playing with Lassie  in the fields? Is it the car salesman voice? I understand that the point they’re making is that he communicates with people rather well, but that’s a separate skill and talent. It has nothing to do with being a ‘regular guy.’  Lastly, I want to call for an end to this kind of thinking. Even if I did want to have barbecue with John Edwards, what does that have to do with the Vice-Presidency? And in 2000, when the media were saying that George Bush was the kind of guy people wanted to  urlLink have a beer with , did they ever think to ask if he was the kind of guy that people wanted to die with? If he was the kind of guy who people wanted to lose their jobs with? Feel me?  But let’s not get dark. It’s a good thing that Edwards is on the ticket. Let’s hope for the best.

      I'm having problems with my printer at work today. Every time I send something to print, it just gives me a sheet of paper with the words 'Personality Not Supported.' Oh, how clever is life?  And we're having our first staff meeting at my new job this afternoon. First item on the agenda is devoted to topics such as: 'How are you growing?' and 'Is there anything we can do to support your growth as an activist?' That's very different from staff meetings I've had elsewhere, but I find it refreshing.

      The Fourth of July is not the kind of holiday that excites me. I don’t like excessive summer heat or large, hollering gatherings of locals or hot dogs or the same script we’re always read about freedom and liberty. Don’t get me wrong – this has nothing to do with me not liking the United States. I’m down with the USA, and I’m glad that I was born here and still live here. It’s just that I don’t like any event that requires people to shut off their brains and all rally behind the same trite slogans when most people don’t even really understand their full meanings. Or our imperfect history of implementing the ideals we’re supposedly celebrating.  It is especially hard, of course, to celebrate the Fourth of July when our current administration has appropriated for its own purposes anything and everything resembling patriotism or positive thought about the country.   Plus, the depictions of what Fourth of July celebrations look like really turn me off. Like judging from local commercials in the Austin area, if you’re not running off to the lake with your blond, demure wife and your extra-terrestrial-looking 5-year-old daughter named Kaitlin or Conner, the one with the huge bug eyes and near-albino hair, the one who is laughing in the back seat of the F-150 and bouncing up and down as she drips her ice cream on the upholstery, then, guess what – you’re not our kind of American.  Still, though, I try to make light of all this and have a good time. This past weekend, though, wasn’t terribly successful. Most of the weekend, I just felt really lonely for the first time in a while.   Friday night was actually fun. Went to Charlie’s, ran into Herlinda and Carlos, had my drinks, ran into a hot guy I’d messed around with a couple of months ago. The Cuban Guy. Awesome. So we talked all night, and I invited him to a dance at ALLGO for Saturday night. Cool.  Saturday night not so hot. I came to the dance, felt a little worn out. Then I get a call from Cuban Guy. He says he’s on his way, but he’s lost. I try to clarify directions, and he says he’ll be here in 10 minutes. 20 minutes later, he’s calling back and says he’s more lost than he was before. Now he’s frustrated, so he’s just gonna go home and we’ll talk later and do stuff then.   So I’m alone at the dance, which happens to be attended by every fucking happy couple in Austin. One lesbian couple is even celebrating their 6th anniversary, and the deejay plays the first song they ever danced to in 1998. And I’m alone. I’m alone, watching these people who love each other be lucky enough to accept each other and dance with each other and look at each other and whisper things to each other and know that they’ll still be together tomorrow. But me, I’m alone.   Sunday, Independence Day. And did I get to experience my vast independence! I was alone the entire day, just doing things around the apartment, thinking a lot about those couples, thinking about my own stuff.  And Monday? Exactly the same. Ate some Church’s Fried Chicken. Contemplated everything.   Today, I read the blog of a friend in NYC. I would link to it, but he’s really secretive about it, and so it’s probably safer not to. Anyway, he writes about the questions we’ve all heard a million times when we’re single: ‘So, do you have a boyfriend? You don’t? Why not? You’re young and attractive and smart.’  As if the people who have boyfriends are necessarily young and attractive and smart. Frankly, I think it’s harder to find someone when you’re young and attractive and smart. It’s complicated, this gay life. Yesterday afternoon, I had a beer with Adam, and I was thinking aloud. I realized that when I was younger, I had such an interesting naivete about love and relationships. I just assumed that if a guy were single, he would be available. In other words, if I meet a single gay guy, and if we hit it off, and if we like each other, and if we start having deep feelings for each other, then it must follow that we might want to become boyfriends, right? And see where it takes us, right? Absolutely wrong.   So what else? I made some progress on my play this weekend. I’ve noticed several nests of wasps living under my patio roof. I washed my sheets. I took several showers every day this weekend. I read Gore Vidal’s novel  urlLink 'The City and the Pillar,'  which really kind of bummed me out this weekend. And right now, I really want a cigarette.

      Looking forward to the weekend for sure. This week has been tough on me in terms of keeping the energy and spirits up. I guess I’ve just been drinking too much, not eating enough, getting little to no sleep, and having my blood drawn out of my arm for medical purposes. It takes its toll.  &nbsp;  Last night, I had a good time hanging out with my Tia Pat. There was just a lot of drama and uncertainty on my mind last night, and it was cool to just release it. She showed up with cheeseburgers from Fran’s, and we just sat around drinking the beers and smoking the cigarettes for hours. We watched some television. Laughed a lot.  &nbsp;  Russell seems very happy these days seeing Enrique. That’s cool. It’s just so strange how you can talk about something for such a long time and then when it happens, it’s just a natural occurrence. It’s not like someone lit the fireworks.  &nbsp;  Elray is Elray. I talked to him last night, and he made me laugh as he always does.  &nbsp;  Michael is MIA. I heard from him a couple of nights ago, when he was going to the Café Tacuba and Control Machete concert. Nothing since then.  &nbsp;   urlLink Manny  is excited because his sister Melissa and his son Nicholas are coming into town within a matter of days. This, in turn, excites me. I’ve always loved talking to him about our families, and I think it’s so fucking cool that he has a son. I can’t wait to meet him. I also can’t wait to see Manny being a Daddy. That’s fucking awesome.  &nbsp;  Talked to my mom yesterday, and she said she was concerned because I sounded sad or down about something. I hate it when mothers get all perceptive. I was down. But it was mainly that lack of energy thing I’d mentioned earlier. Just needed some rejuvenation. Click  urlLink here  to see me with my mom and Manny and my sister and Mark. &nbsp;  So I hope this weekend is cool. I am meeting my aunt and her friends for drinks at the Cedar Door after work today. Manny is coming along as well. Then we’re going to the opening at Mexic-Arte. Then to Oilcan, where they’re having a benefit for  urlLink Project Transitions .  &nbsp;  Let me quote Debbie Deb: "Look out weekend 'cause here I come / because weekends were made for&nbsp;fun."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Do the robot dance, bitches!!

      Speaking after the humiliating defeat of the Republican-sponsored federal marriage amendment today, Senator Rick Santorum made an amazing and disgusting comment:   Isn't that the ultimate homeland security, standing up and defending marriage?   Wow. By using the phrase 'homeland security,' he now equates fags like me to terrorists. To the people who flew airplanes into the World Trade Center and whose aims are the destruction of our society.  I'll take that challenge, motherfucker. Go ahead and call me a terrorist. But what the fags like me will destroy is the hateful misinterpretation of this country's ideals that your side flaunts for mere political advantage.  Fuck you, Rick Santorum.   By the way, Rick Santorum is the twatbreath who inspired our favorite  urlLink sex columnist  Dan  urlLink Savage  to invent a new meaning for his  urlLink stupid name .

      The gay marriage thing. I’m not going to get into it too much because my opinions are pretty predictable in this case. Still, I consider it an insult and a shame that the Republicans have turned this failed proposed amendment into a political weapon. It’s a legislative form of gay-bashing.  So I went with Manny to a rally at the Capitol last night. The gathering was meant to fight against John Cornyn in particular, as well as the whole issue of the amendment even being around. The rally was put on by LGRL, and their slogan was ‘Save Our Constitution.’ I think that this slogan is not the way to look at the issue. If we leave the gay marriage question to the states, and every single state passes legislation barring same-sex marriages, then have we won? Just because we ‘saved the Constitution?’ No. This isn’t about saving the Constitution, it’s about saving the love. Acting on the principles that supposedly guide our government.   Anyway, I suffered from strange emotional twists and turns during the rally. I tried explaining this to Manny, but I’m not sure I was able to get it out right. I don’t know. There’s a lot for me.  After the rally, we went to Charlie’s. Yay! Drank a lot of cheap fuck-you-up beers, sang the songs, talked a lot. This is something I love. There is nothing better than doing this with Mans. He makes me think and laugh and dance and get drunk in ways that I don’t experience with anyone else. It’s the fucking best.  And there were several things we talked about that I loved. About how he feels living in his new apartment. About his sister. About the crazy crazy gays. Other stuff. Madonna business meeting!  Later, we went to Oilcan, where we ran into his friends Horace and Dusty (I think that’s his name…I’m a little forgetful). Then to Boyz Cellar, where we danced to ‘Open Your Heart.’ Yay! Fun! Some old Mexic-Arte people were there, and we got crazy on the dance floor.  It was a fucking great night, and I got gay drunk, and I got gay rhythm, and I kissed gay lips. And no fucking Republican asshole or his agenda will erase that.

      This is from today’s USA Today. It’s incredibly depressing to think that 20 years have been completely wasted while millions of people’s lives have been destroyed. Last I heard, there were 900,000 people infected with HIV in the United States:   BANGKOK — The two-decade search for an AIDS vaccine, the only way to end the global crisis, is all but starting over, researchers here said Monday.  • The only vaccine to complete two large-scale clinical trials, AIDSVAX, proved a flop.  • A major Thai trial now enrolling patients and using a two-vaccine approach has drawn criticism for including the failed vaccine.  • Most of the 30 vaccine candidates now in the pipeline are relatively untested, and they're so similar that if one fails, they all may fail.   If that isn't discouraging enough, the next wave of large-scale human trials will be especially challenging because countries with the biggest epidemics lack the resources needed to study thousands of patients.   "This is a global disgrace," says Seth Berkley, director of the non-profit International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. "There hasn't been a serious effort, and until there is a serious effort, we'll never get there."   And then later in the articles, there is even more upsetting news:   The search for an AIDS vaccine has long been overshadowed by the search for new AIDS drugs, which are far more profitable because patients must take them for life.   This is unbelievable to me. And meanwhile, of course, our administration continues with its ridiculous strategy of promoting abstinence instead of safer sex. And they rescind funding from organizations who are trying to save lives simply because they offer condoms or family planning services. There is nothing else to think except that all the fundamentalists are going to hell.

      I had planned on being calm and productive this weekend, but that did not happen at all. Friday night was a bit of a blast, as I met Manny and his sister for drinks. I’d never met his sister before, and I was very excited about it, especially given how much fun we’d had when he met my family in Laredo. His sister looks quite a lot like him, I think, and she seemed like a very warm, fun and caring person. Manny is pretty close to her, I know. We threw together some drunken plans to travel to Houston the following day, which really excited me.   So I ended up home, and I woke up the next morning wondering if we would actually get on the road to Houston. I packed a small bag just in case. Basics: toothbrush, hair gel, dental floss, Cool Mint Listerine. That kind of stuff. I called Manny to see what the story was, and I invited him and his sister to lunch. He never called back.   So whatever. That just tires me. I just figured I’d go about my day and take my bag with me in the car so I could be ready in case he did call back. I had lunch with Herlinda at Juan in a Million. I went home and read a little. I had a small early dinner with my aunt, Gina, Toni and Sonia. I called Adam and made him join me for a drink. We started at Oilcan at about 5 or 6 pm. Then we moved the party to Charlie’s, where I stayed until  after 1 am.  While at Charlie’s, everybody kept telling me that Ben (of recently broken-up Daniel and Ben) was having an afterparty. I got really excited, because I tend to love afterparties, and I think that Ben’s a really cool guy with a brilliant sense of style, even if he’s kind of distant with me. But I just couldn’t hang on after so much drinking and being out and about for so long. By 1:15 in the morning, I was completely deflated. Maybe I’m getting old. So I just walked out and came home. Left my goddamned debit card at Carl’s register. Again.  Checked my telephone. No calls, no messages.   Sunday, I woke up with a hangover, which I treated with my regular remedy of Watermelon Ice Gatorade. Yums. Was in one of those Sunday reflective moods, so I called up a bunch of friends to just talk, but nobody answered. Maybe it’s too early to call people, I thought.   Later, I ended up hanging out with Elray. We had lunch at Luby’s – ‘let’s get ourselves Lubed,’ I’d said. That was surprisingly yummy, and we laughed at the people who were working there. This sounds awful, but we said that they spoke ESL – English as a Serving Language. But we can make that joke, you see, because we’re Mexicans, okay. So don’t give me shit. Plus, they were pretty rude.  While we ate, Elray and I ended up in one of those deep and emotional conversations we get into sometimes. We talked about our ambition, things we want, the gay life, the gay love, the troubles, the challenges, the lack of hope, the fact that we should maybe just do a gay suicide and go to that big gay disco in the sky. I’ve always thought that he and I are very similar in certain ways. I think I still do.  After that, we went to Charlie’s to try to pick up my debit card. It was 6 pm. We didn’t stop drinking until about 4 am. Spent the night at Elray’s in the K-Hole. Had nice dreams. Played with a melon.  So that’s my weekend. The sanitized version. The little-to-no-details version. The version that doesn’t contain secrets that were revealed to me or secrets that I created for myself.   Tonight I’ll probably try to settle down a bit and get some rest. Maybe someday my telephone call will get returned. Maybe Madonna will kidnap me and turn me into a Kabbalist. My aunt is still in town, so maybe I should spend more time with her.  Weezy Jefferson died. I loved that show. One of those priceless 1970s things that I get all creamy about. Certainly, it was no ‘Three’s Company,’ but it was a damn good show.   Speaking of that favorite decade of mine, I figured out what I want for my birthday, which is in two months. I want a good, funky turntable so that I can start collecting original edition vinyl disco records from the 1970s. How hot is that? I want to have a collection of everything – Donna Summer, Chic, Diana Ross, and even some stuff from the 80s like Debbie Deb and the breakdance stuff. Okay, my pants are getting tight just thinking about it.

      As predicted, these are very difficult days. But I was on the phone with him on Wednesday night, and his voice sounded so different. There was so much pain and confusion. And right after we hung up, I had a new understanding. Things became so clear to me all of a sudden. I knew how to talk to him about everything now – not just our friendship, not just the unreturned phone calls – but  everything , the causes, the roots, the solutions. It had been in front of me the whole time.   And I knew I had to talk to him soon. We had agreed that we would meet in person last night to go over everything that’s been on our minds. I had even talked to him right before he got out of work, and we agreed again to meet in the evening. So when evening came, I called him. No answer. A couple of hours later, I called him again. No answer. At the end of the night, I gave it one last try. No answer. It’s happened again. He’s run from me. But not just me. He’s run from himself and from things that are larger than us.   Such a sad shame. So much to lose. Who knows if there’s still a chance for us to talk – he won’t see me or talk to me, after all - but life is too short and too beautiful to be running like this.

      Dan Savage is so cool. In his most recent sex advice  urlLink column , he lashes out against the heteros in light of all the bullshit going on in this country. Funny.

      Great fucking news. John Waters’ new movie, ‘A Dirty Shame,’ will be released on September 24 of this year. That’s only two months away! The movie has some of his regulars, like that fucking crazy  urlLink Mink Stole  (Taffy from ‘Female Trouble’ and Connie Marble from ‘Pink Flamingos’), Mary Vivian Pearce (Donna Dasher from ‘Female Trouble;’ She’s the one who says my favorite line: ‘I’ll have two chicken breasts, please.’), Patty Hearst (Juror in ‘Serial Mom’), and Channing Wilroy (The Marbles’ Butler in ‘Pink Flamingos’). The main stars, though, are Johnny Knoxville, Tracy Ullman and Chris Isaac. This is strange because the stars sound like the cast of a cheesy HBO comedy series, but I’ll hold my faith in Mr. Waters for now.   Other stuff is other stuff. Still difficult, but I have a full and open heart, and I have faith that everything is going to be fine in the end. Because I live my life as dictated by the Gospel According to Madonna.

      I forgot to mention that there are things I am doing in this cruel summer to try to keep myself sane and as close to happy as possible. I had had the idea recently that there’s a new hobby I want to start: collecting original edition vinyl records from the 1970s. So in the midst of my confusion and sadness on Saturday, I went to Top Drawer Thrift Store to look through their records. Motherfuckers, I found some good shit:  &nbsp;  1. Parallel Lines by Blondie. Fuck yes! I love this album. I love Blondie. Their lyrics are so fucking clever and the attitude is fierce. Who else can come up with lines like: ‘Beat it creep! Dematerialize.’  &nbsp;  2. Come On Over by Olivia Newton-John.  &nbsp;  3. That’s the Way of the World by Earth, Wind and Fire.  &nbsp;  4. American Gigolo by Various Artists.  &nbsp;  5. Break Out by the Pointer Sisters.  &nbsp;  6. Into the Gap by the Thompson Twins.  &nbsp;  There were one or two other albums I bought, but I can’t remember which they were right now. Some of these are not from the 1970s, I realize. I think my parameters are going to be from 1974-1984. I really want a lot of disco stuff: The Emotions, Cheryl Lynn, Chic, Donna Summer. Also some eighties dance stuff like Debbie Deb and Yaz and Shannon.  &nbsp;  Another thing I’m trying to do is work on my play some more. I just wish I had a title I liked. The top of page one is back to saying ‘Untitled Disco Theater Project.’ I’ve been through a lot of ideas. Most recently, I had been calling it ‘In the City of Whores.’ Then there was the period when I wanted to have the phrase ‘twelve-inch’ in the title, because that’s the kind of record that was invented by a disco deejay to better suit club play. So I was tossing around ideas like ‘Twelve-Inch Heaven’ or ‘My Baby Has Twelve Inches’ or ‘Death by Twelve Inches.’ You, know, stuff like that. Then there was ‘Take All the Fruit from the Tree.’ And there was ‘Hot Pink Disco Trash.’ And ‘The Pound in the Chest.’ A bunch of stuff, none of which works for me right now.  &nbsp;  So I read Daniel’s screenplay yesterday. I liked it quite a lot. It’s very John Waters in that the characters have dementias and flaws that are very much like his characters’. Reading his screenplay, I could definitely hear Mink Stole’s voice screaming his lines. I also liked some of his ideas – there are ‘free gay prostitutes’ in the work and these two ugly girls who have never had sex because they’re so ugly. They end up getting a makeover, and when they become pretty they realize that they’re actually lesbians. They just didn’t know they were attracted to each other because they had been so ugly.   Anyway, I have to go. ‘Ray of Light’ just came on my Launchcast, so I’m going to do the spaz dance she does in the video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      And the drinking. The drinking. All the wonderful drinking.  &nbsp;  Because what else can I do? Because I have to go to church.  &nbsp;  Last night was more of the drinking. With Morgan. Beginning at 5 in the afternoon. This was after waking up at 3 in the afternoon because we had gotten so knackered the night before.  &nbsp;  It was a good time, though. Philip was there, and David&nbsp;Gee was there and Adam was there. There were hot dogs. Some asshole bought everybody in the bar a round of drinks. Which is nice, of course, but then he wouldn’t shut up about money, and he clearly has issues with his shit, and he’s still gonna go home alone at the end of the night.  &nbsp;  At one point, I got on top of the bar, bent over and had Carl spank me a few times.  &nbsp;  Daniel showed up, and he was looking cuter than he normally looks. Don’t forget – I’m really fucked up in both the head and the heart right now because I’ve&nbsp;just been viciously stomped on and abused by someone I love and trust. I’m not writing that for pity, I just want to make clear my state of mind in last night’s situation.  &nbsp;  So Daniel’s looking cute, wearing this red vest thing. We talk, and he goes to the car to get me a copy of a screenplay he wrote. It’s called ‘Mazel Tov: A Tribute to John Waters.’ And I think this is great. I need a friend in my life who’s as obsessed with John Waters as I am. Who is also a writer. It’s fanfuckingtastic.  &nbsp;  But again, the main thing is that I’m really depressed. So I needed a pair of lips to kiss last night, and they were his. So we kissed at the bar. I ran my hand up and down the back of his red vest.  &nbsp;  That’s all. I didn’t get scandalous with him or anything. It was only kissing. But I really needed it. I needed the illusion of being even partially intimate with someone. The false comfort of flesh and breath. The feeling that when your eyes are closed, it could be anybody in the world who’s kissing you: Rufus Wainwright or the guy you saw on the street earlier this morning.   Now it’s Tuesday. Another day. Goddamn it. What the fuck do I do?

      A very ugly thing happened on Friday night, and so I have spent the days since then doing a lot of soul searching and drinking and shedding some really painful tears.  &nbsp;  There are songs I love that have been around to cheer me up and remind me of who I really am. Like ‘The Best of My Love’ and ‘To Be Real.’ Ha – even looking at those titles, I feel like they could be used for my autobiography. And everything by Madonna.  &nbsp;  It’s even harder to be at peace with things in life when the weather is uncooperative. We are in the worst part of the year, when the heat makes my face feel like rubber and my arms feel so scrawny.  &nbsp;  What can I do? I have talked to my friends. I have talked to my aunt. I want to be happy. I want life to be a little more fair. Not entirely fair, because I’m not so naïve. Just a little bit more.  &nbsp;  I want my energy and spirit to be rewarded.  &nbsp;  I want to know what lesson I’m supposed to be learning from all of this madness.  &nbsp;  I want to get out of the mud.  &nbsp;  I want to stop having to beg for respect.  &nbsp;  I want to find out that things aren’t as hopeless as they seem in the gay world. That love must exist somewhere and be completely free from fear or guilt or pain.  &nbsp;  I want to understand how it is that we can be so incredibly cruel to people we care about.   None of this is easy. The days ahead look very difficult for me.

      Cool news. My friend David in San Francisco has decided to start a  urlLink blog . You should read it all the time. David is one of the coolest motherfuckers I’ve had the pleasure of knowing. And he’s incredibly sexy. I met David in January 2002 when I visited SF for the first time. The guy I was visiting wasn’t gay, so I really didn’t have anyone to show me around and take me to all the dirty spots. Russell told me that I should call David, as they had gone to school together and he was well aware of how dirty David can be. I was hesitant, because I found it a little strange to make a random phone call to a stranger asking him to show me around the city. But I did it, and he was incredibly cool, and I even had a little gay crush on him.  David is the fag that all you motherfuckers want your sons to grow up to be. He owns a leather jacket, he lives in San Francisco, he composes music, and he has a beautiful penis (from what I hear). And he says nice things about me on his blog. So I’d like to ask my vast readership of 1.7 people to go to  urlLink http://cementbrunette.blogspot.com/  as frequently as possible.  What else? Last night was The Char. Clay did come into town, and I got to see him, and I love him more than ever. He’s so cute. And he has this way of unintentionally acting like a dad all the time. Like with a minor grunt at the back of the throat, he can indicate such vicious disapproval. He seemed a little bit shorter than before, but that’s a good thing. And the night was like the end of the wonderful and brilliant movie 8 ½, where all the people Marcello Mastroianni knew in life are dancing around in a circle. Everybody was there. Adam, Clay, Daniel, Elray, Rafael, Dee, Lorenzo, Orlando, Gilbert, David Gee, pretty much everyone except for the Russell.  Not much else to say. I’m poor, I need money, I’m a gay fag drunkard, and I’m all alone in the world. Cheers!

      The weekends have become unpredictable. Two weeks ago, I thought I was in for a wonderful time, and it ended up being one of the most heartbreaking and frustrating things I’ve experienced. Last week, I thought I was in for some dark and gloomy days, but it ended up being a weekend of excess and smiley drunkenness. So I have no idea what to expect for tonight and the next two days.   Clay is in town beginning tonight, so that’s really exciting. He was my editor at the Austin Chronicle from 1999 to – I don’t know – 2002? He gave me good assignments, and he is incredibly sexy, and he is somewhat uppercrust, but in a non-pretentious or annoying way. I’m always going to have a crush on him. He’s such a fucking prince.   Was reading earlier that Donatella Versace has gone into rehab for cocaine addiction. Oh, Donna. Donna, Donna, Donna. You can’t get  addicted  to cocaine, silly – haven’t you learned anything from the gay boys? I mean, please. Addicted? To  cocaine ? You just need a disco nap, honey. Really. I mean, come on now, you’re Italian! Muscle up, you  urlLink withered drag queen .   Reading about her, I found out some interesting little tidbits. For example, her passport photo was taken by Steven Meisel – I shit you not! How fucking diva is that?! Also, Courtney Love once said that she likes hanging out at the Versace estate because they get to “do cocaine off the Picassos.” And that once, Donatella was refused entry into Splash Bar in New York.   Okay, that last fact perplexes me. I’ve been to Splash Bar in New York, and, well, let’s see, how do I say this? It sucks! And it’s a generic Xerox copy of every other gay bar in America (see Oilcan Harry’s). It’s also populated by decidedly unfabulous people wearing Abercrombie and the like. I mean, like, really dreary middle-of-the-road boys who were probably students at CCNY or something. What the fuck was Donatella doing trying to get into that bar??   Oh, forgot to mention that there was a pretty major case of gay-bashing here in Austin recently. I saw on the news Tuesday that this guy was hanging out at the aforementioned Oilcan (burp), when he met a group of four guys. I think he really hit it off with one of them in particular. Somehow, they made arrangements that all four guys would go back to his place to ‘hang out.’ So they left Oilcan (fart). They went to the guy’s apartment, where they four assholes tied him up, threatened to cut off his fingers, read quotes from Leviticus, beat him, and forced him to stick things up his butt. Welcome to Austin, the most liberal and accepting and wonderful city in Texas.   You could make the argument that this is simply an isolated case and that I’m being unnecessarily harsh to my town. But there was that gay bashing of a policeman recently. And there was the time I got punched in the face on Fourth Street. And the time I was abducted and taken to fucking Elgin. And the time that Travis was punched in the face on Fourth Street. And the time the Russell got into a fight on Sixth Street. Isolated case? Not at all.   Not much else on my mind right now, except for the obvious stuff that’s been on my mind non-stop recently. I’ll be at the Char tonight, most likely. Being completely fabulous. Working on addictions. Winking at an immigrant from some faraway land of swaying palms. Welcome to my country, vagabond. Let me show you how to walk.

      I’m taking a break from all the introspection and self-beating to let you know about a really cool newspaper article. Mink Stole, the John Waters actress I’ve mentioned a few times on this site, has written a piece for the Baltimore City Paper. The  urlLink article  describes the making of the new Waters movie, which will be out in a couple of months.   Beware, however. She’s aged. If your strongest memories of her are in the roles of  urlLink Connie Marble  or  urlLink Taffy Davenport , you’re in for a shock. Of course, you should be well aware of how old she’s gotten, because you have after all kept up with all of John’s most recent movies. Still, though, it’s a bit of a stun when you see her these days.   A huge storm seems to have rolled in during the past hour, and I’m loving it (as they say at McDonald’s). The air is huge, the clouds are breathing fast, and the face of the city has changed. This is the best kind of weather.   Tonight, I will stay at home and watch John Kerry make his speech. Then I’ll try to make a little more progress with my play. &nbsp;   Please kiss someone you love and pray to gay Jesus for lonely men like me.

      I used to be a boy with nearly blond hair.  I used to be a spelling bee champion  I used to be happy reading the encyclopedia every night until I fell asleep.  I used to be uncomfortable around the people who lived in my hometown.  I used to be the drum major of a high school band.  I used to be the boyfriend of a fellow 13-year-old.  I used to be afraid of God.  I used to be a newspaper reporter.  I used to be a student at a bartending school.  I used to be a traveler all over Mexico.  I used to be the guy who won all the awards.  I used to be the life of the party.  I used to be consistent with my writing.  I used to be hopeful that love was on its way.  I used to be a regular at Oilcan Harry’s.  I used to be a teacher for 3-year-old children.  I used to be disgusted by gay bars.  I used to love a guy who called himself a fraud.  I used to love a guy I miss so much right now.  I used to love a guy who ran away, and now I’ve just stopped chasing.  I used to love a guy who’s probably gone forever.  I used to be in love.  I used to be the guy who read things at the altar during Catholic masses.  I used to be paid to write about books and art.  I used to be more fit, even maybe muscly once.  I used to be convinced I’d found the perfect man.  I used to be an only child.  I used to be confident about my place in life.  I used to be less shaken than I find myself today.  I used to be more ready to forgive.  I used to be unfamiliar with real rage and fury.  I used to be naïve enough to think that justice was around.  I used to be better than this.  I used to be stronger than this.  I used to be smarter than anyone you're ever going to meet on this disco-lit and autosycophantic planet, fucking bitches.   I am none of those things anymore. Things fall off and change all the time. This is a particularly painful period right now because of the unexpected and unwanted destruction of my friendship with Manny. I want to write about it more clearly and as honestly as possible, but that will have to wait until later. I am feeling far too low right now.

      ‘I’ve got to stop drinking. It’s going to be fun.’   That’s a quote I read today from Courtney Love. She has just been assigned to go to rehab in one of the four court cases that are currently against her. While I can identify with all the emotions that are behind the first of those sentences, the second one means nothing to me. I have got to stop drinking. I look at the negative balance in my bank account or at the fact that I’ve been to jail once already, and it is completely obvious. Or I go to the bar and see the exact same faces and listen to the exact same songs that were there last time. Or I wake up feeling like shit and have to mount an extraordinary effort to get to work on time. I think about the things I want in my life, and I can’t connect a line between the drinking and the accomplishment of those ideals.   It’s never going to be fun. Despite all these reasons to stop, there are the other things that keep it going. The complete sense of loneliness and inability to make things work in the gay world. Having failed at so much so badly in the personal life. The boredom of being at home. The chance that something good – however unlikely – will happen in the bar. The levity you feel after six glasses of gin. The dancing.   All of this is strong. I can’t lose myself in my work these days, and working on my play is only a temporary relief. It doesn’t change the fact that my bed is half empty. That perhaps my body speaks in a language no one else has understood. That I’ve allowed myself to be mistreated and abused.   There has to be an answer. I don’t want to be like this five years from now. I don’t even want to be like this one month from now. And the sad thing is that I don’t see anyone around me who has what I want. Everybody is fucked up. Nobody has the relationship I want. Nobody has the security I want. Nobody has the accomplishment I want. Every face is an illusion, especially in the bars.   Somewhere on the planet,&nbsp;a man&nbsp;is walking around right now. Or he is asleep and dreaming of something funny. Or he’s on the telephone with his mother, trying to avoid questions he doesn’t want to answer. He wants things. He is not afraid. He treats people with love and respect, except for when they don’t deserve it. Then he gets smart. His head is a field with soft breezes. He is an expanse of thick history collected for ages and arranged in a little blue vase.   He is already here, but I haven’t found him. And he is two different people: the man that I will love, and the man that I will become.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Worked on the play a little bit more last night. I’m edging in on finishing the first act. I’m beginning to worry about length, because the page count for the first act is already somewhere in the 50s, and it’s probably going to get longer once I start revising. This means the play is likely to be over 100 pages long when I’m done, and I really have no sense of how that translates into stage time. I found a really cool quote to put at the top of page one:   ‘Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get.”   - Earth, Wind and Fire  “Boogie Wonderland”   The more I work on the play, the more true historical stuff is making its way in. The whole Patty Hearst scandal of 1974 is becoming a big influence. There’s a bank in my play, and I named it Hibernia Bank after the bank in San Francisco that  urlLink Patty   infamously held up with her huge automatic weapon and beret. In case you didn’t know, this is the inspiration for Madonna’s look in the liner notes for  urlLink ‘American Life.’  Well, Patty Hearst and Che Guevara. And you know how much I love me some  urlLink Che . He’s an idol.   What else? I watched the Democratic National Convention last night. Bill Clinton is incredible and amazing. I realize that most people in this country probably weren’t even watching, but his speech was so smart and funny and brilliantly delivered. Even Dick Morris called it a ‘masterpiece.’ I was really just blown away by his skill.   I’ve also been listening to the record  urlLink ‘Live Through This’  by Hole a lot recently. This record is so bad-ass it’s ridiculous. I bought this record in 1994, sometime in the months between graduating from high school and going off to Princeton. Even ten years later, it hasn’t aged at all, and it still kicks harder ass than anything being produced today. And it’s clever, and it’s not concerned with radio standards, and it’s just completely balls-to-the-wall, as they say.   Courtney Love’s rage in this record is immense. It’s gorgeous. And that’s why I love it so much. It’s a record I turn to when I feel crushed and destroyed by bad love and bad luck. It was there for me in the late-mid 1990s, and it’s here today. But have you seen her lately? She's looked  urlLink hot  in the past few years, but  urlLink now ? Sheesh! What happened? Damn, girl. No, really. Damn!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The weekend turned out better than I had expected this time around. Friday night was Charlie’s with Adam, nothing too special or notable about that night.   Saturday, though, I woke up feeling really worn out and beaten up. I worked on my play a little bit. Then Elray came over with a family pack of Church’s Fried Chicken. A family pack. For just the two of us. Mind you, a family pack also includes two huge vats of mashed potatoes. It was sheer greasy fried decadence. So we just sat around my apartment, eating the chick, watching the movie ‘Velvet Goldmine’ and being lazy. This lasted all fucking day.  Then, this guy I know named Mo called during the afternoon and said he was having a party to celebrate his return from Berlin after being away for five months. The party was in fucking Leander, but Elray and I decided that we had to go anyway because it was going to be full of free alcohol. So after several hours of loafing and stalling, we finally made it out to the party.  Wow. This party. It was full of rich, white, conservative Christian couples who thought they were so cool and understanding and progressive because they allowed themselves to spend time at a party hosted by a gay man. Generally, they were pretty nice to us, but their sheer ignorance and cheesiness was completely overwhelming. I was wearing a metal chain around my neck, and so everyone kept asking if I was into s&m. I guess this isn’t such a silly question to ask – the chain was originally meant for a dog – but they clearly have no idea that fashion is an independent concept. And if I were into s&amp;m, would I be wearing my bondage accessories to a party in Leander? Hello.  We stayed there all night, we hung out on the lawn even after the hosts went to bed, and we fucking tapped out all their reserves of alcohol.   Part of me really wanted to have sex with this one particular straight white guy. he's a Republican, so that would violate all my codes of ethics. But I want to have sex with him as an act of cultural revenge. Feel me?  Sunday was Elray day again. We did some errands like Home Depot, but then we ended up going to Oilcan for a free hamburger on the back patio (is this theme of free stuff making itself clear?). While there, we ran into three of his friends. One of them was incredibly beautiful in a Jude Law way. So I was kind of shy and intimidated, but he gave me a big hug and seemed to be open to me for the rest of the time we hung out. At one point, he sat on my lap, and I chained his neck from behind with my aforementioned ‘jewelry.’ Ruff stuff. Hot shit. And he was so fucking beautiful. I wish I could have been a little more bold and made a real move. I think it might have been accepted.  The afternoon was just fun. Glad to spend it with Elray. He was truly the savior of my weekend. I had expected to have a really rough, depressed, introspective&nbsp;time. But he shook things up for me and we had a lot of fun. Like he said on Saturday: "David, there are 2 things that are guarantees in life. One is that when I get into your car, I know Madonna will be playing. And two is that no matter how shitty things get in our lives, we know we're going to laugh our asses off and have so much fun when we get together." And it's so fucking true.  So the storm came in, and it seemed so beautiful and windy and fresh and birthlike. More adventures happened later that night, but I want to end with that powerful storm.

      I'm feeling a little self-gossipy, so I'm finally going to reveal something about my play that only one other person knows. As I've mentioned, the play is set in 1980. It is about a group of gay fags who go on a campaign for justice, in a way. There are also subplots regarding their relationships and loves and so forth.  The juice? The main characters' names are David, Manny, Raymond, Russell and Michael. Mmm-hmm. Watch out.

      Last night I watched Godard’s  ‘Bande a part’  once again. The dance I’d written about earlier in the week, as it turns out, is the Madison. That just goes to show how clueless I am when it comes to real dance, the kind that doesn’t involve me flailing around and imitating moves from Madonna videos. But really, would you recognize the Madison if you saw it performed? My only other experience with this dance is in ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show,’ when Brad is trying to look cool after the Time Warp is performed. Standing there in his underwear, he tries to sound authoritative and with-it by saying: ‘Say, do any of you guys know how to Madison?’  Anyway, I’ve decided that  urlLink  ‘Bande a part’   is a really beautiful and poetic and lovely movie. Most people probably haven’t seen it, so it doesn’t make much sense for me to write about some of the scenes I loved. But in case you do ever see it, I love the  urlLink scene on the metro  where Odile is  urlLink singing . I love the shooting scene at the end of the movie. I love the narrator’s voice cutting into the scene (which was copied in ‘Y Tu Mama Tambien’). I love the scene in the Louvre. I love the  urlLink end , which is totally Chaplin. And the way that dog in the upper right area never moves is hilarious. The whole damn movie is just pretty fucking clever and brilliant.  Watching movies this week and staying out of bars has reminded me of how much I used to love the French language and men. I’m even pretty obsessed with that Jack in the Box commercial where the French guy is interviewing Jack. I love the way he says ‘So you have a problem with the French? Oui!!? Non?!’ Sexxxy. So that’s it. I’m on the superhunt for a hot French guy. One who reads books and uses his hands when he talks. One who wears sweaters and has slightly messy hair. Who tastes like berries and has thin fingers. That’s my new goal in life. And then I’ll move to Paris and never come back to this forsaken state again. You know, on average, even a dumb Frenchman is smarter than a smart American.  Did I just violate the Patriot Act? I hope so.  Not much else to write about right now. I’m going to Laredo this afternoon to celebrate my father’s birthday. This will be a bit odd for me, as I’ve had maybe 5 short conversations with my father all year. But it is what it is, and what do you do? They say I look just like him. That’s always been a fascinating thing for me to think about.  The hottest week of the year is ending. They say that it should very slowly get less infernal from here on. Here’s to hope, even when it’s just a day that’s two degrees cooler than the long day before.

      Last night I was feeling kind of nostalgic, so I went through my computer, reading stuff I’d written over the past couple of years – letters, poems, the first act of my play, résumés, all that stuff. I was very tempted to post some of the letters and poems I’d written, mainly because they come from such a sincere and vulnerable place. I hardly recognize my own voice in some of those writings. And some of the things I wrote about have proven to be mistakes; others have proven prophetic.  The strangest thing is to read notebooks I wrote when I was in college. Scraps of poems, ideas created in the middle of class. Those were the fecund years, in a way. When Jonathan and I played the roles of Rimbaud and Verlaine or Echo and Narcissus or Sonny and Cher. When I thought I was the reincarnation of Xavier Villaurrutia. When a jungle in Central America was just as right as the bars in the East Village.  The second half of the last decade was a really good time, after all. By 1996, you know, we were convinced that electronic music was going to take over and banish the hip-hop empire on Billboard. When Prodigy came out with ‘The Fat of the Land,’ it was the fucking most brilliant thing ever. It was Depeche Mode married to the Sex Pistols. Beautiful shit. By 1997, there were these subconscious images of Taipei and transactions and neon and partying internationally with hot 20-year-olds. Staying up until 8 in the morning. Watching people shoot drugs and have sex. Eating ham-flavored Ruffles in Spain and riding slow trains through unidentified Mexican states.  The notebooks followed me around. The handwriting changed, and the words changed, and the way that I read them have changed. But they’re the same notebooks. Same unfinished poems. Unfulfilled notions collected and placed in a case for no one to see.  And how is it that all this thought, all the smells of any of dozens of  cities, all the lines that were written so tightly, all the miles between NY and DF, all the thousands of bottles of beer, all the clothes and their wrinkles, all the memories and dreams and desires could fit into such a small body weighing only 135 pounds?    Because I’d like to believe that my flesh is a record of all of these things. That when a guy kisses my lips, he is kissing a guy in a park in Seville. And a guy at a party in New Jersey. And a guy at the Basilica in Mexico City. And a boy mowing a lawn in Texas. And that he can taste all the lines that I’ve read in my voice.  Maybe this is how it should work, but who can say what is true?

      Click  urlLink here  to read a more thorough account of the gay bashing that happened here in Austin recently.  I would write more today, but I'm feeling really poopy and odd. Did you watch '48 Hours' on CBS last night? Some people I've met were interviewed regarding a murder that happened here in 1999.  Now Mr. Coworker is talking about how Chinese immigration to the United States happened because the UK drugged all the Chinese and tricked them into traveling to the US, where they were trapped as slaves.

      So my darling friend  urlLink David  in San Francisco separates his posts by subject matter. I'm going to have to copy him today, because there are unrelated and random things on my mind this morning.     Gay Justice   The big news in Austin today is that the gay bashers have been caught. Well, it’s the second biggest news. Something about some airplane crashing into a mansion and killing a bunch of rich people is the juice above the fold.  Anyway, this is what happened. One of the gay bashers was grocery shopping, and he saw that the victim was at the store at the same time. He panicked, thinking that the victim would recognize him and report him. So the basher ran out into the parking lot and waved someone down. He asked the driver for a ride and then  proceeded to tell him why he was trying to get   away ! The driver dropped him off at home, got his address, and reported him to the police.  Okay, now besides the complete and utter stupidity of this criminal, the other strange thing about this story is that his last name is Gay. Really, no shit. He is Mr. Gay. And his younger brother, who was also one of the four bashers is actually  gay . The gay Gay. As in homosexual queer fag buttfucker with two cocks in his mouth.  These good Christian warriors are each facing anywhere from 5 to 99 years in prison. I hope they each end up having cellmates with monstrously huge penises. And I hope they get raped every single day while their attackers read passages aloud from the Bible.   Diva Wars   I’m sitting at work having diva wars with the co-workers. Because one of them just said this unbelievably retarded statement: ‘Cristina Aguilera is the next Madonna.’ Le quoi? Qu’est-ce que tu a dis? Excuse me while I place my eyeballs back into their sockets.  Granted, this is the same guy who recently said that people of color should not be allowed to read ‘The Great Gatsby,’ so anything he says must be taken with a grain of cocaine.  Cristina Aguilera is not the next Madonna because there will never be another Madonna. Never. Cristina Aguilera is not the next Janet Jackson. She is not the next Whitney Houston. She is not the next Chaka Khan. She is not even the next Laura Branigan. She is a completely uninteresting and tacky performer who has had a couple of decent songs. Now she must scrub herself clean and take a long nap.   Idiot Box   In my recent state of mind and heart, I’ve taken to long spells of watching network television as a sort of escape. Last night, I watched ‘Trading Spouses,’ ‘Big Brother 5,’ ‘The Amazing Race,’ and ‘The Late Show.’ Then I tried to go to sleep, but I couldn’t, so I watched ‘Blind Date’ and then ‘The Fifth Wheel.’  This is disgusting. But what can I say? I need the vegetative paralysis right now. And ‘The Amazing Race' is a really, really good show. I always cry at the end. I’m not really rooting for any of the teams, though. Well, maybe Charla and Mirna, but they seem a little thick. Like when they were looking for the painting ‘The Return of the Prodigal Son,’ and Mirna kept pronouncing ‘prodigal’ as if the g were a j.  There are definitely teams I’m rooting  against . Like  urlLink Nicole and Brandon , the Christian fashion models. You must click on that link and see their bios. Oooh, they make my world so cold and dark. 'Our relationship is God-centered.' Please, fag, God doesn't want you saying shit like that. He doesn't even like your whiney ass. And he was offended that you wouldn't drink vodka in Russia. He thinks you need a long violent night in a wet sauna with  urlLink Bruce Vilanch  in order to redeem your sorry perky ass.  UPDATE (2.45 PM): I forgot to mention that I think that  urlLink Will , the gay guy from Big Brother 5, is super duper yums. I'm not typically into dumb blonde party boys, which is completely what he is. But I fucking love the way he's been doing his hair, and I love his yummy face, and I love the color of his beautiful smooth chest. And did you see when he was jokingly trying to seduce Cowboy last night? When he was leaning over the edge of the swimming pool, the arch of his lower back gave me the chills and wood.  This post has been kind of random and perhaps not very interesting. So what, motherfuckers? Gotta problem? Suck off!  Love, David.

      Nobody understands me when I talk about how much I truly hate the ugly heat of summer. ‘But you’re from Laredo,’ they always say. ‘Shouldn’t you be used to it?’  True, the town where I was born and raised typically gets about 10 degrees hotter than Austin does at this time of year. It’s brutal. But growing up with that heat didn’t make me immune to this weather; it made me sick of it. When I moved away from home to go to school, there were many new thrills I experienced: seeing New York City for the first time, being around lots of people who were generally smart and creative, and, of course, experiencing the four seasons for the first time in my life.  Even now, I still find a true autumn to be the most gorgeous and life-affirming thing on the planet. It’s not just the new colors coming out of the trees; it’s the very air. The sky is full of something else that is just so large and refreshing and comforting. The world is a womb. The light falls differently, especially in the evenings, and it’s like everything is arranged for the creation of love. If I ever actually do meet and fall in love with a guy who is going to be the real thing, I will probably meet him during one of the autumn months.  Today is a Tuesday, though, in the first week of August. The local paper says today that this will be the hottest week of the year so far. Temperatures around 100 degrees with a heat index of up to 108. My very flesh feels assaulted. I run toward pockets of comfort and thin drafts. And any kind of love is nowhere to be found or rescued or slapped back into life.  The desert is also on the inside, I guess you’d say.  In other stuff, I watched ‘The Dreamers’ yet one more time last night before returning it to the video store. Then I returned it and rented the 1964 Godard movie ‘ Bande a part .’ I wanted to watch it because there is a  urlLink scene  in ' Bande ' that is referenced in a really wonderful  urlLink scene  in ‘The Dreamers.’ There’s also a really cool  urlLink dance  scene in ‘ Bande a part .’ It’s the cool, 1960s, sexy, dorky, French intellectual with a tongue in the cheek  urlLink dance .  I will say again, and I will say this often, that my birthday is coming up next month. The 14th of September. I hope you’re thinking of ways to celebrate my life and future exploits.

      Strange mood, mainly because I watched the movie  urlLink The Dreamers  again this weekend. I first saw this movie with Morgan when it was in its original release, and I love it. The actors, especially Michael Pitt, are brilliant. I love the way  urlLink Michael  plays his American character with such naked sensitivity. It’s so beautiful it’s almost embarrassing to watch in a way.  My favorite part of the movie comes when the three main characters – Matthew (Michael Pitt), Théo (Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green) – are sitting in the  urlLink bathtub  together. They’ve just smoked pot, and they’ve had all these incredible experiences together. Matthew tells Isabelle that he loves her, and she says that she loves him, too. He then turns to Théo and tells him that he loves him. Théo responds with a ‘Me, too.’ Matthew is deeply wounded by this, because he feels that just saying ‘me, too’ is a less sincere form of affection than his more courageous admission. Isabelle says: ‘But, Matthew, we love you very much.’ And then Matthew gives a truly brilliant response: ‘I don’t want to be loved very much; I want to be loved.’  Fucking brilliant.  Besides that, it’s been a fairly typical weekend. The Char, hot weather, running around all over the place.  Elray is in Miami right now. He’s there to see the  urlLink queen . Tonight’s show, which he will see, is her last show in the United States. He’s going to cream his pants. I'm really fucking happy for him. I loaned him the biography that was done by Randy Taraborelli to read on the airplane. I read it in the plane both times I went to see her - in 2001 and earlier this summer.  What else? I’m so bored of other people’s lives. Fuck it, I’m not explaining that sentence. I’ll just let it stand.  My birthday is next month. Start saving your money. I’ll be turning 28 years old, which used to sound old when I was 24. Now though, I’d much rather be 28 than 24. I like getting older – for now. It’ll probably be a different story in ten years. Especially if I still have the same topics and frustrations on my mind then.  Last night, I was with Morgan and Russell at the Char, and we were talking about how Herlinda (whose new nickname is Herlinda de Toilet, as in ‘hurl into the toilet’) has a new boyfriend. Russell made the comment that now everybody has a boyfriend. Well, la la la! Everybody has a boyfriend! They’re on sale at Fag-Mart. I guess I was just in the wrong fucking aisle, probably looking at Teen People or just teen people, and I forgot that line on my shopping list. Everybody has a boyfriend! I must just be the kind of guy who likes being alone and having to play the ridiculous game called single gay life. Everybody has a boyfriend!  So I scoffed at the sentence. Russell responded with something like: ‘It’s okay, David. You’ll have a boyfriend. He’ll love you the right way, the way you want to be loved.’ The beer was in my mouth, and what else can you do but swallow?
