       Finally! Kelly's video for Breakaway is finally here. Fantastic.  Fan-frickin-tastic.  Go download it now. No, seriously. Now. Don't read this. Download it.  If you're still here, I guess I'll post a message.  So my sister is here. As usual, I can't wait to see Maddy and Tyler, then they get kinda annoying. I know it's so bad to say, but when they are with you all day asking for ten thousand things and wanting to climb all over you and have you play with them, it's tiring and annoying.  I watched that show 'Amish in the City' last night. Not bad. I'll probably keep watching because I'm a sucker for reality tv shows. But after the Amish people got there, you couldn't tell the difference between the city kids and the amish kids. C'MON. The Amish kids had highlights in their hair, really tan bodies, high heeled shoes.. The Amish people that live around here sure don't have those.  I guess I didn't do 'Closing Out The Week' last week, did I? I guess I can do it right now.   People  5. Kelly Clarkson 4. Kelly Clarkson 3. Kelly Clarkson 2. Kelly Clarkson 1.

       Well, as I write this I'm spending the night at Ian and Drew's... It's fun :P But I'm tired. Oh well.   I didn't have to go to Cross Country today! Because of my feet.... They hurt so bad.   I really don't know why I even decided to post this.. But Drew, Ben, and Jason are playing video games. Boring.   Anyway.. my sister is going to be here tomorrow. So this next week will be hectic. Why? Two words. Maddy and Tyler. That's three words isn't it? Cut me some slack :P It's 11:08. That's 8 minutes past when I normally go to bed.   Oh, and just a random shoutout to Veronica. The only person who reads and comments without me forcing them. haha

       Well, I need to leave in a minute for Cross Country, but I'll post anyway..   Not much to say, but I needed to post. 'She Will Be Loved' by Maroon 5 is one of the best songs I've ever heard :P I'm sure that will change by next week, but that's just how my life goes. Obsessed with something one week and over it the next. Well, that's how everything goes except Harry Potter. And Kelly Clarkson. I'm rambling? Yes.   On the topic of Cross Country (were we on that topic?), it get's worse and worse each day. They are working like we are in the middle of the actual season. It's summer practice. I don't see why that is so important! We are going to be burned out by the start of the season. Oh well. Not my fault! And I know they will be complaining like there's no tomorrow when the season rolls around and everyone is hurting.  I can't wait to go to Cedar Point! We are going August.. something. I'm too lazy to click that little calendar button on my computer. But I can't wait! Top Thrill Dragster, Millenium Force, Raptor, Magnum, Demon Drop, Power Tower... mmm... But we'll probably not go because everything I look forward to never happens!   My sister is coming home Saturday! This will probably be one of the last times we see her for a long time, because she is going to Seattle. (I'm sure I've said that somewhere in the old posts..) I want to go to Seattle, but I want them to be closer! Maddy and Tyler are awesome!   The Amazing Race... tsk tsk. Bob and Marsha got eliminated. How stupid. They rocked. Lance and Marshall or whatever the fat jewish brother's names are, need to be gone.  Now.  They bug me like it's no one's business. Oh well. At least Charla and Mirna are in second place. And Bob and Joyce are in 3rd! (I think..) Linda and Karen didn't do so hot this week, but they are still in! They are hillarious.   Speaking of hillarious, anyone watch I Love The 90's on VH1? Loni Love cracks me UP. Especially when they were talking about beanie babies, and she was like 'People put them in their cubicles at work, and smush them together, and scream 'IT'S MY NEW BEANIEEEEE!'' I was dying.   I guess I did have a lot to say? Oh well. I must go finish getting ready to go to Cross Country. I hate it. I'll say it again - I hate it.

       Ok, I decided to do this 'Closing Out The Week' thing. Basically, I'll just say my top 5 favorite of whatever I feel like at the moment. (Movies, Books, People, Songs, TV..)  This week, I'll do.. people and songs!   Songs  5. Meant To Live - Switchfoot 4. Scandalous - Mis-Teeq 3. Accidently In Love - Couting Crows 2. Wrong - Kimberley Locke 1. Breakaway - Kelly Clarkson   People  5. Mirna (From the Amazing Race) 4. Charla (From the Amazing Race) 3. Rachael Ray 2. Kelly Clarkson 1. Diana DeGarmo  There's the lists folks. Comment away. I need opinions.  Sorry I haven't posted for a few days.. My computer is having major issues. It's so stupid.  Charla and Mirna are in 2nd place at the moment on the Amazing Race! How awesome is that? I'm glad Charla is showing everyone that midgets can do anything anyone else can. And beating Alison was awesome, because Alison yelled 'MIDGET' into her face. Haha Alison. Have fun coming back to this sucky town and leading a miserable life. I hate her, if you couldn't tell.  Went to the local 'amusement' park last night. If you can call a park with about 5 rides (all of which twirl) an amusement park.. I hate it there. I want to go to Cedar Point. And if my brother is coming home on the weekend we were going to go, there's going to be problems. I must ride the Top Thrill Dragster.  Random thought - I love Cotton Candy.  I don't really have anything else to say.. I'm home alone because my parents are feeding their gambling addiction.

       Ok, so my neighbors asked me to go out on their boat. Cool, right? Not when I have to fish. I  don't  fish. It smells nastier than our school locker rooms, it takes patience (something I do not know the meaning of), and you have to use worms. Not just worms,  live  worms. Worms that squirt juice when you cut them and try to latch onto your hand while your squeezing them onto a hook. Not my idea of a Sunday evening. I need to go take like 15 showers to get the smell off me. Remind me to say I'm busy the next time they ask me. Oh, so we get out fishing, and after I bait my hook (it takes like 15 minutes), I cast it out and get it caught on a boat. So it took me like another 15 minutes to get it off the boat, then my bait was gone. Another 15 minutes spent baiting my hook again. Finally get it out in the water. I get a bite!! I reel it in, the fish is gone and it took the bait. ANOTHER 15 minutes baiting for a third time, and I just let my pole sit out there while I went to get something to drink. My pole almost fell in the water, and I almost fell in trying to grab it. Let's just say I didn't have fun. :P  Anyway, went swimming in my pool today.. First time this summer with sun. I hate my town. It's overcast or raining 90% of the time. It sucks. And my dad complains when I say I want out. I told him to go to school and listen to what other people say about it then he got mad like he always does when I talk.  I'm ranting, aren't I? Oh well. It's my blog, I'll do what I want! Anyway, I need to go take another shower or something.

       HOW? How did Alison the bitch and her annoying boyfriend Donny take first on the first episode of The Amazing Race? I mean, I know she's from my hometown, but that doesn't mean I'm rooting for her. At least she fell down a flight of steps. That was brilliant.  Charla and Mirna are my favorite team. Why? I like the underdogs, and I feel so bad for Charla. Just beause she's a midget doesn't give Alison the right to call her a midget to her face! Wow.. she annoys me. Karen and Linda are also awesome. They are BOWLING MOMS. What could get cooler?  In other news, The Simple Life just gets cooler and cooler. Nicole cracks me up. Paris sorta gets on my nerves on that show. EVERYTHING is 'hot' and she asks everyone in this annoying voice 'Do you love it?'. ARGH.  Cross Country cracks me up. Me and Jillian just run where we want and when we are out of the coach's view we just take our good old time and go wherever we want and come back when we think we should be done. I love it.  I created a buddy quiz. If you have AIM, my name is MarkR867. TAKE IT.

       Oh boy.. The Amazing Race is back tonight! I am  so  excited. And there's someone from my hometown on that show :P Very cool. I'll fill you in on what happened tomorrow :P  So my sister left.. It's way too quiet. I hate it. In other news, I started going to practice again for Cross Country. Wooo.. I could jump for joy. Running two miles, sprints, cool downs, sweating, sun.. I hate it. At least it's my last year.

       Well, just got back from shopping at the Grove City Outlets. B-o-r-i-n-g. You try shopping with my sister and my mom for 4 hours and tell me what you think. I don't care about Banana Republic. I don't care about Sax Fifth Avenue. I don't CARE about Gucci sunglasses! Just buy me something from American Eagle or Abercrombie and I'm happy.  And I don't know what's happening, but Pennsylvania is becoming more and more like Florida every day. (See two posts below) 80% of the people I saw were Chinese. Someone needs to do something about immigrants, and fast. *coughbushcough*  And I've decided that it should be against the law for someone to sing as good as Kelly Clarkson. It's just not  right . Breakaway is such a good song. That's all that needs to be said, so I'll end it at that.  Oh, and I'm pissed off that Diana is supossed to only sell 50,000 copies of her single. Do people not listen? It's  brillant.  Once again, it proves what this country is coming to. We choose Ruben in season two, and the Fantastic Burrito in season 3.  Terrible . Utterly terrible. First, we have Ruben who can't bust a move without breaking a sweat (haha Veronica!), and Fantasia "Bobo" (where the HECK did that name come from?!..), who sounds like "Donald Duck on Helium". They really should be shipped off to a faraway island with no means of escape. Anyway, I'm rambling.

       Ok.. I just took this How Funny Are You Quiz, and these were my results:     STAND UP: You are a natural stand-up comedian. You watch the news with people, and when you give your opinions, people start laughing. They are not laughing at you, they are laughing because what you say is so TRUE. The world is a very funny place, full of natural comedy. All you do is repeat various humorous things that you notice from everyday life. Your unique perspective on the world is what makes you so funny. Of all the various comedy types, you may be the funniest of them all!    urlLink   How funny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Oh that IS  hillarious . I am by no means a 'stand-up comedian'. haha Just the thought cracks me up. If anyone besides Veronica is actually reading this, take that quiz and go post your results in the comments section.

       So you've found my blog. I won't say much right now (actually, I probably will), except warn you of what's to come. Randomness, meaningless posts, and the side effects of when I get bored. Anyway, now that that's said and done...  I'm got back from Florida the other day. Cool. Not. I've never realized how much I hate this town until I spent three weeks in Orlando, Florida. Nothing but theme parks, sun, and illegal foreigners. That's fine it you want to come to America, but at least learn how to speak the language before you get here and have no idea what people are trying to tell you. Don't get me started.  I saw The Day After Tomorrow last Saturday. Not bad. Pretty entertaining. But a guy walking from Philadelphia to New York City in a storm that's supossed to freeze you solid if you go outside? Right...  I guess I better go.. Maddy and Tyler are here and are just waking up from their nap. Great. That means I get to drag them around outside all day while they scream and give me a headache.
