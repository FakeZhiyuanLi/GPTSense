						   Well today was a bizarre day.  Jeff broke up with his gf finally.  He finally grabbed his balls and did it.  Good job him.  She'll get over it and they'll both be better off for it.   I've decided a couple things today.  First, I've decided anywhere in LA I live, I'm going to wish it was Manhattan Beach.   The apartment that Jeff and I were considering getting and didn't is now rented.  We stopped by it to see if the sign was still up and now the one next to it is available!  Is it a sign?   Jeff has been regretting not moving into the first one more and more as the days go on.  Hopefully he'll act on this one and we can move into it.  $2000 a month, but I think it's worth it.  It's one block from a sports bar, one block from a yoga studio, and one block to the beach (and these are small blocks).   Everything's worked out PERFECTLY and AGAIN, so we'll see if Jeff learned from last time and grabs his balls.  It's a ball grabbing day apparently.  I've also decided that I don't get a fuck about Shadowbane any more.  One of my trees burned today and I realized that I don't really care.  If I just up and leave, I'll screw people, so I'll need to continue to siphon off stuff, then I can go.  I might announce it at the MV meet this month...  PlanetSide is a little overwhelming and I can't see myself really getting into it, but it's nice to blow shit up every once in a while.  Can't really get to know people tho...  too much craziness.  Well-paying job    [X] Girlfriend   [  ] Semi-permanent residence   [  ]   (working on it) Reliable car   [X] Physical activity schedule   [  ]   2/5 ain't bad I guess....

						   I installed PlanetSide last night in my ongoing efforts to distance myself from Shadowbane.  Pretty cool graphics and really smooth FPS engine, which is nice.  I was pleased the default motion controls are the standard (ctrl = duck, etc.) so there's basically no learning curve for me.  I didn't have much energy to play the game, so I just went through a few of the offline training exercises.   It's pretty extensive.  Large scale coordinated futuristic warfare that is waged all day and night.  There are weapons and mech-type armor, personal and group auto transports, even planes and stuff.  Pretty slick.  I like that it's a MMO but not a time sink.  Even though I can develop a character over a the course of some period of time, you can re-customize your character every day for whatever you're doing in that mission.  My problem with SB was that I feel obligated to play and it's hard to just play for 30 mins at a time and walk away.  Not with PlanetSide!  Plus I'm getting the feeling nobody appreciates me or recognizes my abilities in SB, so I'm probably going to quit soon...  I'll get more in depth with PS tonight or this weekend.  Saturday I'm heading to Redondo Beach to look at an apartment I'm considering moving to.  We'll see...   mmmm beach.   /out

						   Can't think to clearly since the damn teleconference system in the conference room across the hall from me is set to 11...&nbsp; that's like 10 but 1 louder.&nbsp; Too bad I don't give a damn about what they're talking about in there.&nbsp; I mean, they could use that to blast some Ian Van Dahl down the hall and I wouldn't be here bitching about it.&nbsp; But that's why I don't run a company (especially a successful one).   I used to really look forward to fridays, but today I didn't.&nbsp; Asshats throughout the country use this day to vary their normal business hours so that people like me have to deal with rush hour for 4 hours a day instead of the usual 2.&nbsp; I carefully structure when I drive to avoid the most traffic and get to work at certain times, but fridays just fuck it all up.&nbsp; People use this day as an attempt to get to the beach "during not so busy times of the week".&nbsp; Too bad goddam everybody goes on friday.&nbsp; Good thinking, Spunky!&nbsp; Now not only are you in traffic for an hour, but you've got my beligerant ass in the car next to you glaring.   And my morning bagel wasn't even too yummy, either...&nbsp; Going to see The Village tonight, tho, so that should be cool.&nbsp; I'll pretty much see any movie, so when people come to me and say "hey, let's see this", I'm always up for it.&nbsp; I liked the other M Night Shamalamalamalan movies.&nbsp; Definitely need a nap first tho....&nbsp; and by nap I mean drink... and by drink I mean four.   /out    Song of the Week:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sprung" by L.L.

						   Okay, we'll see how long this lasts for... Today I had a spit of inspiration and no (legal) outlets!&nbsp; So now I have a place to vent and gripe and provide insight and write random things down so I'll remember them later.&nbsp; Woohoo!&nbsp;   If any poor soul finds this blog, I'm sorry for you.&nbsp; I talk in geek speak a lot since I have a history of online gaming and it's kinda the native language.&nbsp; So STUFGODIEIRLKTHX!!!11oneone&nbsp; Excellent, this blog has already served a purpose... *evil grin and strokes fluffy white cat in arms, I don't know its name*   I'll be journaling stuff that happens at work, home, and "other".&nbsp; Most of the work stuff won't make a goddam bit of sense to anybody but oh well.&nbsp; When I say somthing like&nbsp;"so I was eating this sandwich from the front, right..." and you don't get it, just go along with it.&nbsp; I won't tell anybody you're actually an alien puppy trying to pretend you're human to find our secret stash of urine scented fire hydrants....   Okay, back to work. Gotta wrap up so I can get out of here and go home and set the fucking bane time on my tree that some DHL nh00b dropped and is going to get another Hale-sized fisting (Shadowbane reference, see above note about not getting it).   /out

						   Well I've been holding off saying anything so that I'd actually have some news, but things are still moving slowly regarding the housing situation... I found an awesome apartment in Manhattan Beach and I applied for it, but the guy got a lot of applications and I bet mine isn't the most attractive of the bunch since I just got my job, etc.  My lease ends on the 30th of this month, so something had better work itself out soon...  In the meantime, here are two awesome Flash websites to look and stare at in awe.   urlLink http://www.xeofreestyle.com/    urlLink http://www.2advanced.com/    /out     Song of the day: Goodies by Ciara feat.

						   Every Monday starts the same way: me getting up at 6 like normal accumulating the usual 3-5 hours of sleep (4 hours this time). There's something amazing about Big Boy in the Morning on 105.9. It's a Hip Hop morning show. I have always had a problem listening to music in the morning, especially bass-heavy. There's something about the music they play in the show that isn't obtrusive. DJ E-Man picks some cool popular hip hop. The mixes are a beautiful thing and she sounds great on my 12". (Chris: "I had a date like that")  I successfully enjoyed myself in SB last night, which is amazing. I RPed with another Neph in killing the humanfolk. It was a lot of fun and hilarious and I went to sleep smiling... At 2 in the morning...  I've been given a short list of prereq's for whatever game Chris and I move to: cute anime girls, 2D and 3D fighting, and RPG. Any two of those three elements wouldn't be hard to find together, but all three is difficult...  Jeff and I went back to M Beach this weekend and found a handful of awesome apartments.  Most of them were on the 100 block.   That means it's on the first block at the beach.  Not down the street, or across the street.  ON THE BEACH.  $2000 a month, but oh well.  I'm totally willing to go for it.  I just hope Jeff doesn't drag me along again and chose not to go like last time... I don't know if I can handle that.   He said sometimes he needs to be pushed a little, so I'm going to push a little.   Song of the day: "Gamemaster" by Oakenfold
