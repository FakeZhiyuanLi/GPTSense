      Last night was...interesting? I got roped into going our with Rachel and Catherine to the bar at the Loews in Philly. The event was for The Young Professionals&nbsp;of Philadelphia. Yawn. The bar was gorgeous but the people were less than impressive. Tons of Real Estate folks and reps. from the City Paper. (Trash paper, as I like to call it. Serious. Naughty personal adds and all.) We mill around smoking cigarettes, I drank perrier with lime, the gals had vodka martinis. I'm watching my calorie intake and this was NOT the occasion to break it. I'm not tricking myself into feeling comfortable around these lame-ass dudes by ruining my diet just so I can hold a glass of alcohol and sip it all night.  We pretty much stayed around the people we knew. No schmoozing. Just making fun of the insipid crowd and the old fellah in the FULL, top and bottom, bubblegum colored suit.  We stayed for about an hour (which felt like 5) and moved it on over to the U Penn campus for movie night on the lawn. We saw a HORRIBLE serial called Mystery Mountain about a guy named Ken and his nemesis The Rattler... I joke you not. It was not even kitchy. Just plain horrible. They really neede the guy who did the sound for The Stooges. Their fight scenes packed no punch. (heh heh heh) The main show was a movie called "Youth Gone Wild". The ebtire show we were waiting for someone to go wild - we were left unsatisfied. It WAS totally a ball though. We played Mystery Science Theater 3000 the whole time and poked fun at the film.&nbsp; I think my favorite part was when Tottie ( the dame of the flick) DIED by getting hit across the face with some guys legs, mid air, as he was being flipped over someone else's back.&nbsp; Did you get that?? THAT"S NOT POSSIBLE!!! There was even a dramatic scene of a priest reading the last rites...what a RIOT! Thanks for the memories "Youth Gone Wild".

      I just read an article saying that at his trial, Michael Jackson requested "a celebrity exception to the First Amendment" to keep some of his child molestation case secret.  THAT gets the award for the most arrogant thing I've ever heard.

      I just can't seem to keep my simple mouth shut. In order for me to heckle my pal Dusty, I have to have one of these accounts.  Do NOT think for a second this is a weird stalker crush. Know for a fact that it is.
