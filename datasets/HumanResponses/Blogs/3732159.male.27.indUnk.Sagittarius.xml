      Hey this is my first day here, and man does it feel kind a funny. Everything is all the sudden so new again.  I'm a 27 year college grade, who just moved back to my  home town. Yah not too much fun if you ask me, but I had to. My mother just became real sick, and well dad could care less, so I moved home to take care of her. I picked up my whole life, and moved just to help out.  So.... Now I have given up all my friends, business, and life. I am happy that I could, and that I was able to, but it is not all fun. Good thing I just found a good job, that could be a career which is nice!  Me I am a music nut!! I collect guitars, and love to play all styles of music. I read a lot, and love sneaking out for a beer or two at the local tavern. I moved from a small town, to the big city, and can not stop thinking of the MR Haggard's Song "Big City." I love that song... Well enough for now

      Wow!! Landlords are calling me back. This is great!! I went and looked at a place today it is a good deal, but it is just not close to anything. I think I should hold off for a better place.  The list of books to read seems to be getting longer and longer. But, come fall I will have the time to nip that list in the butt. I love fall when I can crack a bottle of my favorite Cab or Merlot, and kick back with a great book. Looking forward this fall/ winter will be great!!! There is nothing better than coffee/wine, and a good book.     Nothing else to report for now..

      Well another V8 splash smoothie down, and another flavor to try. Wow I like this stuff, and I don't  know why. Next flavor will be wild berry if I decide not to  get another orange. I have to say this is the best juice on the market.     It was a great weekend to go apartment shopping, but I did not find that perfect place yet. I did narrow my search down to a more focused area which will help.  I can make the deadline of Sept. 1 if these landlords will call me back.  The one apartment I did see was dirty, smelly, and  over priced. I know the right place is out there, but I just have to find it. The game plan for this coming weekend will be more apartment shopping.  It seems week in and week out I do the same thing every day. I wake up go to work, come home, cook, practice/ watch TV, and go to bed. I think I need to spice up my life a little, but, maybe this is good for right now. Till next time........

      " Things turn out better by accident sometimes, but you can't organize an accident."     -Jeff Beck    I saw this quote today, and though it was great.  So I have to look at apartments tomorrow. Of the 12ish landlords that I called 4 called me back, and 3 have canceled our appointments. Man this sucks!!! Why can't these people who spent money on advertising in the paper call me back? I just want to give these people money. At least the apartment that I wanted to see the most is still ago!     tomorrow apartment shopping, Irish fest, and I have to go to a party! I can taste the beer already.........

      A couple of months ago I bought a  instrumen that I have wanted for many years, a Chapman Stick. Man these instruments are cool. It has to be the best sounding, and hardest instrument to play in the world!! I just can't get the hang of it. At first I was playing it every day for hours on end, and now I take it out at max twice a week. This instrument was invented by Emmett Chapman, and is considered one of the few American invented instruments. I don't think it can be more that 35-40 years old. The 'stick' is a 10 string guitar played upright, and tapped instead of strumed. You get sound out of it by just pushing the string down. The instrument is like piano played upright. So tonight I was playing it, and finally made some progress forward. I think I am going to try to play at least 4 times a week, and cut back my guitar playing.    I have a new simple pleasure in life... V8 splash smoothies. Man I love this stuff! It seems I have a small glass of this every night before I go to bed. I am not sure which one I like the most, but the orange cream is pretty darn good.    Well that's all for now... Till next time

      Finally I had a great day at work! So far this week it has been nothing but problem after problem. I guess it was a good thing because, I know how the system works a little better, but it still sucks to have a no good very bad week.       Other than a good day at work nothing else is new. Same old stuff different day. I played guitar for a while, and now on the computer. I think it is about time I snuck out, and started playing some of the local open mic night again. I used to love playing at open mic's, but haven't for a long time. Sounds like a plan!!! Oh, I also started mentally packing up all my stuff for my move into the city. I truly believe that mental packing is a very important step to the real packing. First you need to get a plan of what will go where, what should go into each box, and how many boxes you think you will need. The mental packing takes triple the amount of time than real packing, but it really does help. The good news is I never unpacked when I got here, so half my stuff is already packed! Do know that there are some boxes that I have moved 3-4 times, and have never unpacked them? Maybe I should throw them out, or sell them on eBay. Who knows...... I do know this I need a bigger place!

      So what is with all the people who refuse to make coffee at work? I am not a heavy coffee drinker, but I tend to make at least one pot of coffee per cup I pour. To top it off every time I go to get a cup of coffee, there is never any left. Man, these little things just make me mad, but I guess I can rant and rave all I want, and nothing will change. So far that is the most pressing issue of the week no coffee. As one can tell I live a very interesting life. So I have never been a big TV watcher, but this summer I have become hooked (and I must stress hooked) on the show,  Big Brother.  I am hooked!!! I was just stoked to see that jerk Jace put up for eviction. Ha ha ha......... I never thought that I would be a TV watcher, and now I am hooked on a couple shows. Some people may tell me it is a bad things, and others will not admit that they watch TV, but hey I don't care. I am really looking forward to Irish fest this weekend!! Hopefully there will be a whole lot of dancing, singing, and SODA bread. Man... Things like this make me happy to be back in the big city. Well, that's my story and I am sticking to it. As Jimmy said.........." If you want to see the world you've got to kiss the girl....."

      Well it has been a while since I did this, and I thought I would start up again. Lots of things going on. The band and I played our first show in a long time, and it went real well, but I can not figure out if I should continue to play with them. Ever since I moved it has been a hell of a lot harder to keep things going on my end. I have a real job, and am no longer a 'working musician.' The band has been going great, but I can not keep up all the traveling that I have been doing. O well what can ya do. I have another weekend comming up of nothing but apartment shopping. I am so close to paying someone to find an apartment for me. I hate the tours, and all the sales pitches. I just hope I find a place this weekend. O.k. here's my big question from the weekend of driving around the country.... Are billboards more effective now that people have cell phones? Are people more likely to pick up there phone, and dial that number since every thing is right there? I don't know.........
