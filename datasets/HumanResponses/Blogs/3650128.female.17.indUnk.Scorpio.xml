      This was like the worst day of my life so far. I had my alarm set for 5:30 because we had a long drive to get to the funeral. We had to be there at no later than 8:30. I was thinking worst-possible-scenario on the way out there. I figured the worst it could get is I would get a bloody nose and it would be all over my white shirt for when I went in front of the church to do my reading. So, what happens? Oh yea...bloody nose on the way out there. In the truck (I had just bought tissues at the gas station before we left) on the way. I was not happy.  So, then we were at the funeral home and everything was okay for a bit. I started thinking back to all the memories my Busia had been part of in my life, which were quite a few, and I started crying. The family got there and everything and we visited with Busia and said our final goodbyes. My mom put a yellow rose in the casket with her, and when she did that I started bawling because the yellow rose was my grammy's favorite flower who died years ago. Then, Aunt Dolly brought this little stuffed roudolph that Busia loved and she put that in the casket.   It didn't really hit me that she's really gone until we came home and I was laying in bed. I was just thinking back to the early times when we would be at her house and Dzja Dzja (grandpa) was still alive. Busia always gave us these little boxes of cereal when we were there. I remember going over there for Christmas when I was little. And I remember christmases at my Aunt Nadine's house when Busia lived there after Dzja Dzja died and Busia moved out of her house. Dzja Dzja always used to play cards with me. He was the first one to show me how to shuffle the deck. I remember Busia's birthday parties we would have at her house and especially her 90th birthday party which was just a few years ago. I think that was the first time as far as I remember that I saw the rest of that side of the family.  Oh well, the point is...I just didn't realize how hard I would take it. It's gonna be hard later on because I just know that one of these days I'm gonna not think about it and ask my mom if she called grandma lately. She would call grandma on a monthly basis usually. It used to be weekly, but then it got to the point where our schedule changed and Busia couldn't really handle the phone as well as she used to anyway. It's going to be rough, but I know I will get through it.   Anyway, good night everyone.   Good night Busia...and good-bye.

      That would be my Busia (Polish for grandma). She's my great grandmother on my mom's mom's side (It was my mom's mom's mom). She was 93 1/2 and lived one hell of a life. That woman has been through it all. I think my mom and I counted 6 wars? Hm...wow. Oh well. Visiting hours are on Sunday, and then the funeral at the church and everything is Monday.   This is the third death in the family this year. First, it was my Aunt Lois. Then, my cousin Jeff who was a cousin by marriage. And, now my Busia. They were all kind of split a month in between, but it was still the third one this year.  Anyway, I have an insanely busy week this upcoming week. Sunday and Monday are filled as you've read. Then, Tuesday I start working with Kathie after the taping and I think I'm still helping Sue at the Tribune, but I'm not positive on that yet. Also, Wednesday is Geauga Lake which should be a lot of fun. It will be a great way to relieve stress since I have all this other crap going on.  Ezzie, has gotten to the point where if she needs to go outside and I'm not paying attention, she takes a running start and pounces on me and starts barking insanely. It's interesting. I hope she grows out of it though.   Oh well...it has been a long day. If you wanna chat or anything, you can email me at majorettegurl05@yahoo.com (which will be changed soon enough b/c of my no-longer-majorette-and-class-of-05-status) for now. I will post a new email address when I find enough ambition to make one. Or, you can IM me at Angeldancer2519 on AIM. Either way, I'm online often enough.  Adios!

      It's official...I win. Only because we came to this odd agreement. He forgot why he cared in the first place, so now he doesn't care...which is good. I needed until at least July 7th anyway to mark a month because I would have missed out a whole week in June, which would have sucked bad.  School is going great for the most part. I'm skipping around on assignments, which I'm not technically supposed to be doing. Hm...I don't have much else to write here today, it was a boring butt day. So...here are some links you can look at :)  **Click  urlLink  here  to check out Trevor's Blurty!  **Click  urlLink  here  to check out Ray's Journal!  **Click  urlLink  here  to see what Trevor's website has in store for ya!  Enjoy!

      School is...going quite well actually. But, I'm killing myself to finish by the end of June for what? To say I win? What a crap load. I am so retarded sometimes, I just don't understand my reasoning for a lot of things. Gosh, by the time I'm done with it, I'll probably be dead enough I still won't even be able to say I win...grrrrr. This is becoming really frustrating to me. I have a TON of work left to do and I don't feel like it's getting done fast enough. Act I of Hamlet is done. Act II today would have killed me, so that shall be tomorrows project. I was supposed to write like two 3-page essays today. Didn't happen. Ugh. And to think: This is ALL TREVOR'S FAULT! Hm...Oh well, I WILL WIN, I WILL WIN, I WILL WIN!!!!  I guess I feel a little bit better, but it definitely doesn't help being sick and all and trying to do all this work. I have a year's worth of work here all smashed into three weeks just because I have to win. This is definitely not fair.  Good news: I think Ezzie is FINALLY learning how to go potty outside. Thank God. At least that's one less issue I have to deal with while doing this work and getting it done before the end of June. I have like...oh...nine days left to complete it all.  (I think I can...I think I can...I think I can)  I'll show you Trevor. You will not win.  Anyway, I automatically win either way because I'm still getting my diploma a year before you do!  Oh well, I definitely need some sleep for my taping tomorrow, but I napped earlier so I'm not ready for sleep yet. I need to be up at 7 to get ready for it.  One last note: I WILL WIN!

      Oh, uhhhhhh...well, let's do a little math here:  months worth of thunderstorms + lots and lots of rain + a little bit of hail / (a couple funnel clouds * touchdown tornados) + picnic = negative.  I know I can't really add that well which was proven when I added 2 and 2 to get 9, but...I think my calculation there is correct.  I'm workin on it...JEEZE!

      I DID IT! Uh...well, sorta. It's a semi-diploma. Not quite. I had commencement today, and I got the case for my diploma, but of course I have to finish my final english credit to get it. Oh well, no biggie. My friend Matt came with me to Columbus to see me graduate. That was pretty cool. Brittany couldn't go because she was at Girls' State. The day of my commencement was her last day there, so that kinda sucked. I didn't go to sleep until like 2:30 last night. I was so sick during the day too, so that definitely didn't help my mood. My mom slept upstairs in the guest room, I slept in their living room, and my dad, Matt, and my brother all slept in the basement. Awesome stuff.  Oh yes, I had like 9 rice krispie treats...  Also, let's see here...what else? Hm. Oh, I didn't get to meet my teacher there, though it would have been cool. It doesn't really matter much though because I'm going to probably have contact with him for like another monthish or so? Who knows? I want to get my course work done as QUICKLY as possible. So, I'm trying to get through it. If I really wanted to, I could have it done by the end of June but now that I look at it I don't know if I really want to.  Anyway, I am going to go finish my last question or so for John Keats's "Ode On A Grecian Urn" and then who the heck knows? I am kinda hungry again. Applebees really did hold me for a long time there. Well, I'm outta here!

      And it's a big one. It's definitely not the thunderstorms and invisible tornados earlier either. Trevor cares! This is definitely HUGE...I vote...let's have a party!!!!! It's the beginning of time, but this time, Trevor cares. LOL. Why the crap am I making such a huge deal of this? He's psycho. He's freaking out. Anyway, if anyone can help him, please let me know!  Okay, stupid random thought, and you can reply to this as you feel the need, but...if a mosquito were to try to bite a balloon, would it pop?  Oh well, note to Kiran: LEAVE MY MOODS AND MY PROBLEMS ALONE! I WILL FIX THEM MYSELF! AHHH!  Okay, I feel better :) Woo!

      ...was awesome! Well, Trevor and Kris would definitely disagree, but...it was fun. If not for the opera, for hangin out with Kris and Trevor cause them two are just way too fun. lol. Trevor definitely said the 'C' word tonight. That was hillarious. I definitely couldn't breathe because I was laughing too hard. As for the opera, for being so religious, it was for sure funny in quite a few parts. And, dang do thems kids have vocal cords. You would definitely not find me doin that. 1)I'm no public speaker and 2)I am soooooooo not a singer. Let me repeat that for you so you get it I DO NOT SING! I can't carry a tune in a bucket...it's way too heavy for me. I'm a weakling.  Anyway, I love how I come home and mom doesn't even care what it was about or what it was like. I just got a "Hi, don't get online, do the dishes." And there were only a million from dinner sitting there. I think the family does that on purpose, but...whatever. I try to be nice when other people have to do the dishes and I reuse my dishes and rinse them and stuff. Ugh...puppy poopooed in mom's room again. She's REALLY gotta learn the meaning of grass=bathroom (hers anyway). I will go clean that up and do some more dishes. Bye!

      Ezzie is my puppy, and she's FINALLY learned how to play fetch. I've been trying with her on that. Now, if only she could learn to hold herself until she gets outside to go to the bathroom, we'd be doing pretty good. She is getting better with that, but she still tends to just go in the house if we aren't paying attention to her.  I didn't wake up until 1:15 this afternoon. Horrible of me. I hope my mom gave me gas money for Trevor. He's driving out to Blossom for the opera. Kris is going too and it'll all be loads and bunches of fun. I do need to find someone to go to the Scrappers game with though. Jon (my now ex bf of 4x) left, and he was going to go with me, but since he left...I doubt it anymore. We don't even talk and I think I'm going to let it be that way.  My relationship with Jon was...hm...I don't know. But, you know it's gotta be bad when even your grandma says "You need a new boyfriend." That definitely threw me off and kinda got me thinkin about what was goin on. So, I decided to talk to Jon about it. Just talk and explain my frustrations. I was in no way dumping him. I think he thought I was and he was like "Whatever makes ya happy." and left. Haven't heard from him since.  Anyway, enough about that crap. I am goin to Godspell and it will be lots of fun :) I can't wait. I could wait on writing the three page report on it though...lol. Oh well, I will probably post about the opera tomorrow. Bye!

      Alright, so...I was bored and decided to just stumble across the blogger website. So interesting I know, but whatever. I am going to Godspell tomorrow with a couple friends of mine which should be cool. I have to go for my assignment for school. It's for my semester project and I have to write three pages on it. So, for $12 tickets, it's not such a bad deal. I will update later, but I wanted to post something to see how things are working here.

      ...was boring. The&nbsp;kid I gave my number to (Kevin), called me 9 times on&nbsp;Saturday. He left 4 voicemails and I was busy workin the Tribune's tent with Jason. &nbsp;And Jason and I were having loads of fun workin together. Kevin on the other hand ended up lying to me saying that he was going to be a Junior next year...I found out he's really like 14. Not that it mattered, he kinda pissed me off with calling me 9 times in a day. I was kind of surprised Bobby cared enough to even say anything, but like I told him...I would have found out sooner or later that he lied to me anyway. &nbsp; I don't like people that lie. &nbsp; Anyway, now that that's over...I worked a bit on my english class, and I am going to finish typing things up on Tuesday while I wait to go to the Scrapper's game. That's definitely a good thing because I'm really hoping to be done by the end of July. I just have a couple REALLY BIG assignments I left for last to do and then a few essays I have to write.  &nbsp; Oh well, I think I am done here. Have a great night everyone!

      WOW! The fair is so much fun! Guy, my editor, said it was just plain boring the day before I went. I don't see how though. The funniest thing ever happened to me last night though. I was standing there doing what I was supposed to be doing, and these girls come up and of course I was polite and everything, so this is how it went: &nbsp; "Can I help you?" &nbsp; "Um, no..." &nbsp; "Okay...*insert confused look*" &nbsp; "Do you see our friend Kevin over there? *girl on the right points*" &nbsp; "Yea..." &nbsp; "Well, he thinks you're pretty hot and he wanted to come over and ask you for your number, but he's too shy. We were wondering if you wouldn't mind coming to talk to him." &nbsp; "Actually, I can't leave the tent, but I can give you the number. *writes name and number on a piece of paper and hands it to girl on the right*" &nbsp; "He's a really good kid, I promise, but he's just too shy. Thanks! *walks off*" &nbsp; Wow...odd. Anyway, my logic: if the kid is too shy to ask me for my number, he's too shy to use it anyway...and if he had the guts to ask me himself in the first place, he'd deserve it. &nbsp; Oh well, the fair is fun. You should all come out and visit the Tribune's tent! I'll be there from 6-9 p.m. HAVE FUN! &nbsp;

                        Is going okay for now. I have been a little bit stressed with trying to get  all of my homework done AND keep up with the stuff going on at the paper, but I  know I will get through it. I have to finish The Canterbury Tales and finish the  last of the essays I started. I have until the 24th to get it all done  too.   &nbsp;   My dad and I went to the Cleveland Indians game on Friday. They played the  Twins and WON!!!! It was awesome because we were right above the dugout along  the third baseline and we were right in the action of the game the whole time.  It was great. It was a huge difference from our "Nosebleed Heaven" seats as my  dad called them. lol...It was a great night for the game, and just great  overall.   &nbsp;   I really have to kick my butt and get my assignments done on time for the  paper. It would be really great, if only I didn't have all of my school work to  go with it. UGH! Oh well, I know I will get it done. But, I am off to work on  cleaning up the kitchen a bit and do some of my homework (or even that One Forth  Awesome article I've been so meaning to write!) and I will update again  soon.

                        I hope this works, it would be a lot easier to update than getting on the  Web site which I totally forget is there too often.   &nbsp;   Oh well...My graduation party is coming up tomorrow, Jessica's birthday  party is today. We aren't having Bruster's ice cream as planned before for my  graduation party. It was a little expensive, and we were going to have tons of  food anyway. And boy are we ever having tons of food. I'll have leftovers for  years to come. My mom won't have to go shopping in a long time. LOL.   &nbsp;   Not really, but it would be cool if it really did work out that way.  Whatever cake I have left over, I am thinking of taking to page one Thursday.  Some of the food too, given that it's fine to take though. That's like 4 days  between there, if it's not fresh, I'm not taking it. So, I guess we'll see.     &nbsp;   I was really hoping to have a couple of these stories done this week, but  it's just not happening. The story on One Forth Awesome is ready to write. I got  the journal and everything for it, and the pictures from the negatives look  sweet. Hopefully I can get those back for Jesse. I know the policy on regular  pictures, have no idea what it is on the negatives. But, it was a smart thing to  think of...Go Jesse!   &nbsp;   I met Dan and Jesse yesterday when I went to go take pictures of the  marching band my cousin is in. They are in it too. I know my editor won't use  the posed picture of the tubas, so I will probably just give that one to Dan for  everyone to see and have. I don't see why not, it's not like I'm going to use it  for anything.   &nbsp;   Well, I need to get going. Jessica is having her birthday party at 3 and  then we're going to clean together to get ready for my party at noon tomorrow.  Have fun and hope to see everyone this weekend!

      My life has been absolutely crazy. I haven't really had too much time to get here and update this, so I figured I should probably do that. I am watching The Lion King for my homework. I am doing a compare and contrast essay for school comparing The Lion King to Hamlet. I'm not quite done with Hamlet, but I'm working on it. I am almost done with my class too. I have a few essays to write and a few Canterbury Tales to read and summarize. I also have to finish reading Hamlet. It won't be too hard, but I've had a bad week and I probably could be done this week if I didn't get so tired and sick.  My teacher should be interested in my essay though. It's definitely something different.  But, I think I am going to go watch the rest of the movie now. If ya need me for anything...call me! But, don't forget...   My Graduation Party!
