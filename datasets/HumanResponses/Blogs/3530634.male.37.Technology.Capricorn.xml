       Just yesterday I found out that Blockbuster started an online dvd club like Netflix. Today I started a two week free trial. The one thing I did notice is that new movies that I could not get yet on Netflix I could get on Blockbuster but I will try it and let you know! Also Blockbuster does not have as big of a collection as Netflix but it is still rather extensive! Just have to see how the mailing is! I will keep you updated!!

      I like many other suburbanites take the forty-five minute drive down I-75 each day to my day job at Compuware in the heart of Detroit. When the company first decided to move downtown, I was reluctant of course. Mostly because of the long drive. But working downtown has other advantages. Everything you could ever want is within a block or two. Greektown, the Casinos, Hart Plaza, The ren-cen and just about every bank in Michigan.  In its own way, Detroit is very beautiful; at least in the summer. The sidewalks are always awash with people of different colors, creed and backgrounds. Not as bad as in New York, but enough to make it interesting to watch.   The architecture downtown is simply amazing. You look at some of the old buildings and just contemplate how did they ever build that? Even the dilapidated buildings show signs of a bustling, busy downtown of an age ago.  The one fact about Detroit I think is so cool is that it is the only place in the United States where you can look South and see Canada!  One thing that amazed me when we moved downtown was the number of panhandlers / homeless people that roam the streets. A day doesn't go by when I'm not asked for money or a smoke while I take my daily smoke breaks. Some of the people that stop you look like they could really use the help. Others look like they make a better living off the streets than I do working! Others just walk by and don't say anything.  For some you feel pity; like the old man with the burns across his face and arms, complete with no ears. Looking at him almost makes you sick to your stomach. You wish you could do something for him and I often find myself digging into my pocket for change. I often wonder do I do it out of pity or out of the hope that it will make him and his grossly disfigured face go away?  I remember one day watching a man walking around in front of the building looking in trash cans. For what I'm not too sure but he never found anything. It looked as though he had all of his personal belongings in a few plastic grocery bags and stuffed into the pockets of the winter coat he was wearing; in the middle of summer. The man walked around not bugging anyone until he found a small patch of grass under the shade of a lone tree along Woodward Avenue. There the man carefully rolled up his torn and tattered coat and laid down for a nap.   How could this guy sleep with all the traffic and jack hammers and construction equipment I thought to myself. But I guess in the moment we forget that the small patch of grass he found was home for him. The sound of the cars and construction nothing more than a goodnight lullaby. We forget that this man has no bed to sleep on; no TV to watch. The sounds of downtown are as familiar to him as the sounds of the kids playing in the yard on a warm summer day are to me.  I often wonder how such a great place as The United States of America, who so quickly leaps to the aid of others in need can forget about her own people. Sure lots of people say "Why don't the bums just go get a job?". But let me ask you, would you hire someone who has had most of his face burnt off and smells like the dumpster in the back? Would you want to see this guy at the front counter of McDonald's as you walk in to get your Extra Value Meal?  Probably not.  So why doesn't he get disability or welfare or get on some government program. Well he could, but where would they send his monthly checks? Besides do you really think he would make enough to afford a place to live and food to eat?  Look at a man I call Eddy. He looks as though he is in his sixties. He is a short stocky man always with gray stubble on his face and a winter cap on his head. His shoes are tattered and torn and he is always wearing three or four jackets. He carries all of his belongings with him everywhere he goes and he always walks at a very quick pace never stopping to ask for money or a hand out. He's always moving. Where he's going I don't know but wherever it is, he is going.  Why can't the greatest country in the world create a program to really help people like Eddy and the others Downtown. Why not clean them up and get them a place to live? Teach them how to take care of the place and how to take care of themselves?  Maybe if we weren't spending 6.5 Billion a year on Nuclear Weapons or 9 billion a month looking for Weapons of Mass Destruction in a sand box most people can't even find on a map we would be able to take care of our own people.  Maybe if society wasn't taught to look down upon the less fortunate as bums not willing to work, only wanting a free lunch, we would find a way to help each other.   Until then, there's always the change in my pocket.

      Update on Dianna and Whitney. (See article below) Dianne is still looking for a new home (one she can afford) here in Rochester or Rochester Hills.  She struggled for so long to make sure Whitney had the proper education and safety of our city, she would hate to lose all of that now.  Her Mobile Home is demolished. Water pipes burst and everything is ruined.  Kitchen is gone, Living Room is gone. 90% of Dianna's clothes gone. Whitney's bed and dresser gone. They have salvaged what they could - but have to start over.  I don't know what they will do with the Mobile Home as it is.  Meanwhile we need to replace some of the necessary things.  Whitneys computer [someone gave it to her] was destroyed.  The fund at Community Plus Savings is still active if anyone wants to donate. We have obtained legal council [donated] for Dianna just in case the park wants to get nasty with her. Dianna is making a list of everything that was destroyed and we will post it here when we receive it.  Please help out our fellow residents! Additional info  urlLink Click Here

        I received several complaints from residents about a low flying airplane towing a banner that read: "Does reopeining landfill=Toxins" Courtesy of R H City Council".  People were upset because they thought this banner was an advertisment sponsored by the City. In fact, it was not.  The airplane banner appears to be yet another attempt by the residents living in Quail Ridge, Rookery Woods and River Valley to stop the landfill cleanup and redevelopment project at Adams and Hamlin Roads.  I can assure you that no city tax dollars were spent on this airplane ad.

      Hi Gang   - The Holiday Helpers of Rochester Hills  You may or may not know - one of the Holiday Helpers families was left homeless by the recent storm. A tree fell on her mobile home destroying her home and most of the contents. Fortunately, both were not at home when this happened. They are now in the process of trying to retrieve any thing they can.  Rochester Mini Storage has donated a storage unit for her use.  She could not afford insurance and did not have any.  Her Mobile home has to be torn down.  All that she and her 14 year old daughter had was in the mobile home.  Dianna worked hard to pay it off - so that she only had the lot rent of $460.00. Then she was laid off - Dianna is working now - but at a much lower salary.  Now she lost her home...  Dianna is a wonderful woman. If I didn't already have a full house, she would have moved in with me.  She works very hard to provide for her family. She never has asked for any help and is always the first one in line to help someone else. Now it is our turn.  Dianna and Whitney need a home.  She would like to stay in the Rochester area so Whitney can stay in the same school.  We have contacted some low income housing we have and they already have waiting lists.  A very generous donation was made (by a resident) of a mobile home for her use in Rochester Estates. Unfortunately it needs too many repairs for Dianna to afford.  If you know of a home, apartment, flat or townhouse that would be available for $500.00/mth or less - please call me or e-mail.  Please help get the word out.  I have not checked with Rochester - does any one have any contacts there?   She will need a flurry of things once she lands - I will try to get a list out once we know. Also a fund has been set up for her and Whitney.  I would like you all to know that Georgia Malinoski (a close fiend of Dianna), Rochester Mini Storage, Ron Crowell and Pat Somerville have all been tremendous in their efforts to help Dianna - Georgia is the ring leader who jumped head first to help her friend.  I sure hope in a time of crises, we all have a friend like Georgia.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or pass this one to anyone who can help.                           MY HEART TO YOURS! Sues  248.650.8047 Fund for Dianna and Whitney is:  Community Plus Savings Bank c/o DIANNA WHITCHARD 310 W Tienken Rd Rochester, MI 48306 (248) 651-8202

      Here's the scoop on the Road Funding problem our City faces today.   To fully understand the problem, you need a little history lesson. The City of Rochester Hills is a Home Rule City. That means we have a City Charter created and adopted by the residents by which we live. The City Charter determines everything from how the City operates to who can serve as Mayor to how much taxes can be imposed.  The current City Charter limits the City's General Operating tax to 5 Mills. A mill is $1 for every $1,000 of taxable property value. The Charter then allows for the residents to vote on special millages such as fire and Police protection. At one point there was a fund for local roads, however it was terribly inadequate and the Council at the time allowed the voted millage to expire with the intent of going back to the voters for a special local road millage that would cover the actual expenses. Unfortunately, this millage attempt failed. While the City has been pretty successful in "Finding" the money to cover some local road repairs over the last few years, with the economic downturn and the loss of State funding, the money has dried up.  Another flaw with the Charter is that it was created for a Township that was becoming a City with about 30,000 residents. The original creators of the Charter did not envision that in 20 years, the City's population would more than double! The General Fund it maxed out and the special voted millages are quickly approaching their max due to the Headly Amendment to Proposal A.  Now people that know me know I'm a straight shooter. I don't sugar coat things and my penchant for "telling it like it is" has gotten me into trouble more often than not, but that's who I am so why stop?   The Straight Stuff  The City Council is faced with some tough decisions when it comes to local roads. Let's face it, the money has dried up and decisions on what gets cut needs to be made.  Now of course Brenda Savage and the No New Taxes Group or Mary Jo Dinha and her anti tax group will tell you the City has cash falling out of the Treasury. But I was there when they were both asked to put their money where their mouth was. We invited them both to go through the budget with us and show us exactly where they think we could make cuts and do you believe it? They REFUSED! Gee, I wonder why?  Now the struggle I have is what do we do as Council Members? Do we let the local roads crumble and turn to gravel? Do we stop plowing snow in the winter? Do we stop chloride treatments and grading of gravel roads? Or do we tap into other general fund money and close Spencer Park and Bloomer Park and the Environmental Center? Do we make cuts in Police Protection since we subsidize the Police fund with General Fund money? Should we just start doing special assessments to fix roads? Or do we go back to the voters with another plea to listen to the facts and approve a millage and ignore the unsigned flyers from the Anti Tax groups?  Welcome to my world....  It's a tough decision. One that can't be made lightly. Probably the toughest decision I've had to make since I've been on Council.  Now Rochester Hills has the second lowest tax rate in Oakland County. You would think that approving a small millage to help keep the road in front of your house in good shape should be easy to pass. Facts are that the Anti Tax groups have made statements that they will oppose any new taxes we try to pass. Why? We don't know. We asked them to put their money where their collective mouths are and they all refused. I can tell you my opinion... It political. Look who is in charge of the Anti Tax groups; disgruntled former city officials that just don't like who is in office so they do everything they can to undermine any attempt to make the City a better place to live. But that's just my opinion. No facts here...  I would really like to hear comments from any readers and see what you have to say. What do you think? Here are the options:  1. Approve a small tax millage that everyone pays, even businesses. 2. Stop all local road repair and maintenance activities. This includes snow plowing, grading and chloride treatments. 3. Find the money somewhere else and cut other City Service such as parks and recreation? 4. Create special Assessment Districts, do the required work and place a lien on homeowners who will have to cover 100% of the cost.  You tell me. What would you do if you where me? I would like to know.  If you have any questions, comments or concerns feel free to let me know. Irrelevant or nasty anonymous messages will be deleted so tell me what you think, but please have the fortitude to sign your name.

          Today the world pays its respect to The Great Communicator and the 60th anniversary of the Day that freed Europe from Nazism 60 years ago. I can't find a better way to commemorate both than with Ronald Regan's Memorable D-Day speech from the 40th Anniversary of D-Day.  urlLink Click here  for pictures.  June 6, 1984 We’re here to mark that day in history when the Allied armies joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried out for liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed for its rescue. Here in Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history.  We stand on a lonely, wind-swept point on the northern shore of France. The air is soft, but 40 years ago at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June, 1944, 225 Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs. Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance.  The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers — the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine guns and throwing grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting, only 90 could still bear arms.  Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who put them there. These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.  Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender’s poem. You are men who in your “lives fought for life . . . and left the vivid air signed with your honor.” I think I know what you may be thinking right now — thinking, “We were just part of a bigger effort; everyone was brave that day.” Well, everyone was.  Do you remember the story of Bill Millin of the 51st Highlanders? Forty years ago today, British troops were pinned down near a bridge, waiting desperately for help. Suddenly, they heard the sound of bagpipes, and some thought they were dreaming. Well, they weren’t. They looked up and saw Bill Millin with his bagpipes, leading the reinforcements and ignoring the smack of the bullets into the ground around him. Lord Lovat was with him — Lord Lovat of Scotland, who calmly announced when he got to the bridge, “Sorry I’m a few minutes late,” as if he’d been delayed by a traffic jam, when in truth he’d just come from the bloody fighting on Sword Beach, which he and his men had just taken. There was the impossible valor of the Poles who threw themselves between the enemy and the rest of Europe as the invasion took hold, and the unsurpassed courage of the Canadians who had already seen the horrors of war on this coast. They knew what awaited them there, but they would not be deterred. And once they hit Juno Beach, they never looked back.  All of these men were part of a roll call of honor with names that spoke of a pride as bright as the colors they bore: the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, Poland’s 24th Lancers, the Royal Scots Fusiliers, the Screaming Eagles, the Yeomen of England’s armored divisions, the forces of Free France, the Coast Guard’s “Matchbox Fleet” and you, the American Rangers. Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here. You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you. Yet, you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer. It was faith and belief; it was loyalty and love.  The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next. It was the deep knowledge — and pray God we have not lost it — that there is a profound, moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest. You were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt. You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One’s country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because it’s the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you. The Americans who fought here that morning knew word of the invasion was spreading through the darkness back home. They thought — or felt in their hearts, though they couldn’t know in fact, that in Georgia they were filling the churches at 4 a.m., in Kansas they were kneeling on their porches and praying, and in Philadelphia they were ringing the Liberty Bell.  Something else helped the men of D-Day: their rock-hard belief that Providence would have a great hand in the events that would unfold here; that God was an ally in this great cause. And so, the night before the invasion, when Colonel Wolverton asked his parachute troops to kneel with him in prayer he told them: Do not bow your heads, but look up so you can see God and ask His blessing in what we’re about to do. Also that night, General Matthew Ridgway on his cot, listening in the darkness for the promise God made to Joshua: “I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.” These are the things that impelled them; these are the things that shaped the unity of the Allies.  When the war was over, there were lives to be rebuilt and governments to be returned to the people. There were nations to be reborn. Above all, there was a new peace to be assured. These were huge and daunting tasks. But the Allies summoned strength from the faith, belief, loyalty, and love of those who fell here. They rebuilt a new Europe together. There was first a great reconciliation among those who had been enemies, all of whom had suffered so greatly. The United States did its part, creating the Marshall Plan to help rebuild our allies and our former enemies. The Marshall Plan led to the Atlantic alliance — a great alliance that serves to this day as our shield for freedom, for prosperity, and for peace. In spite of our great efforts and successes, not all that followed the end of the war was happy or planned. Some liberated countries were lost. The great sadness of this loss echoes down to our own time in the streets of Warsaw, Prague, and East Berlin. Soviet troops that came to the center of this continent did not leave when peace came. They’re still there, uninvited, unwanted, unyielding, almost 40 years after the war. Because of this, Allied forces still stand on this continent.  Today, as 40 years ago, our armies are here for only one purpose — to protect and defend democracy. The only territories we hold are memorials like this one and graveyards where our heroes rest. We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars: It is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost. We’ve learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent. But we try always to be prepared for peace; prepared to deter aggression; prepared to negotiate the reduction of arms; and, yes, prepared to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation. In truth, there is no reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the Soviet Union, so, together, we can lessen the risks of war, now and forever.  It’s fitting to remember here the great losses also suffered by the Russian people during World War II: 20 million perished, a terrible price that testifies to all the world the necessity of ending war. I tell you from my heart that we in the United States do not want war. We want to wipe from the face of the Earth the terrible weapons that man now has in his hands. And I tell you, we are ready to seize that beachhead. We look for some sign from the Soviet Union that they are willing to move forward, that they share our desire and love for peace, and that they will give up the ways of conquest. There must be a changing there that will allow us to turn our hope into action. We will pray forever that someday that changing will come. But for now, particularly today, it is good and fitting to renew our commitment to each other, to our freedom, and to the alliance that protects it. We are bound today by what bound us 40 years ago, the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs. We’re bound by reality. The strength of America’s allies is vital to the United States, and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe’s democracies. We were with you then; we are with you now. Your hopes are our hopes, and your destiny is our destiny.  Here, in this place where the West held together, let us make a vow to our dead. Let us show them by our actions that we understand what they died for. Let our actions say to them the words for which Matthew Ridgway listened: “I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.” Strengthened by their courage, heartened by their value [valor], and borne by their memory, let us continue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died. Thank you very much, and God bless you all.

      In the June 3rd edition of the Rochester Eccentric letter writer Deanna Hilbert makes several accusations and arguments why members of City Council should be recalled over the REI / Suburban Softball landfill issue. You can see the entire letter  urlLink here :   I would like to take a moment to address some of the outright lies and inaccuracies in her letter.   Quote : “The Mayor wants to raise our taxes indefinitely this fall for road improvements.”   FACT : This is just not true. The Mayor can not raise tax rates, only the Council can raise or lower the tax rate per the City Charter and as a member of Council, I can assure you there has been no discussion of raising tax rates to pay for local roads.   Quote : “According to Michigan law, it is illegal to change zoning via a consent judgment.”   FACT : If anything in the consent judgment was against the law, why would a Circuit Court Judge approve the consent judgment? The consent judgment between the City and REI was approved by the Circuit Court and upheld in the court of Appeals.    Quote : “There are currently three separate legal actions against REI's and the City's re-development plans for this property. This should ring a bell that something is terribly wrong here.”   FACT : The lawsuits have been won by the City and REI and were brought by a severely bitter rival of REI’s and homeowners that did not want the development to be approved. In fact, the court is now looking at granting REI compensation from Grand Sakwa (REI’s rival) and the homeowners for bringing forward frivolous lawsuits.   Quote : “…the unprecedented amount of proposed waste removal is a threat to the environment and the safety of the residents.”   FACT : The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) support the removal of this waste due to the leachate and methane buildup and has indicated that the clean up should present no threat to residents.   Quote : “The same environmental firm represents the City and REI. This is a conflict of interest.”   FACT : The city requires the developer to use our environmental consultant so there will be no ability for a developer to hire a firm solely to refute the City’s findings. This is common practice in most municipalities.   Quote : “There have been other studies and conflicting reports from the MDEQ.”   FACT : Earlier studies we conducted utilizing only five soil borings across the landfill. These early studies indicated only a small amount of environmental problems. Since the original five borings, there have been more than 20 additional soil borings and a much more thorough study has been performed. The MDEQ has never published a conflicting report. They have always supported our findings and continue to support our efforts to clean up this site.   Quote : “… why have the city and the MDEQ let this go for over twenty years? … Why does recreational activity continue on this property today?”   FACT : The landfill has been a problem for a long time. The City and the MDEQ have been attempting to get the previous owners to clean the landfill but have been unsuccessful. The MDEQ is currently looking at the legal ability of the MDEQ to stop the recreational activity on this site due to the fact that there is raw garbage coming through the landfill cap in some areas. The City is fortunate that a developer is willing to clean up the problem with the landfill.   Quote : “I have not seen any documentation that confirms the presence of leachate in the Clinton River or methane gas in basements or utilities from this landfill.”   FACT : That is the reason we are doing this. If we wait until there is already contamination in the Clinton River and Methane in the basement of homes, it’s too late. Current data shows the leachate and methane moving towards the Clinton River and the adjacent homes. Are we supposed to wait to do anything about it until another home explodes?   Quote : “This issue does not involve a "privileged few' but our entire community and those around us.”   FACT : As the Council representative from a different District, I can tell you that cleaning up the landfill and protecting the Clinton River is a much greater concern to the residents I represent than the NIMBY attitude of those living in the half million dollar homes across the street from the landfill.   Quote : “The Council and the Mayor are setting the tone and developing an environment that is an excellent example of what recall was designed to do.”   FACT : It is and shall remain my opinion that if the residents of my district want to recall me for doing everything I can to help clean up a leaking contaminated landfill than so be it. The first attempt by this group failed. Will they try again? Who knows.  The recall process was designed to remove from office individuals in strict dereliction of duty. It was never intended to be used as a tool to threaten elected officials to sway to the wants of a few and that is what Ms. Hilbert wants. A few Quail Ridge and Rookery Woods Homeowners think that by threatening to recall the Mayor and the City Council we will stop doing what we believe is right for the entire City and bow to the homeowner’s demands.  Understand this: I will not freely allow these few individuals to undermine efforts at cleaning up this landfill and protecting the environment for all Rochester Hills Residents.   If you have additional questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me or any member of the Council. We will be happy to discuss this issue with you.

      At the June 2nd City Council Meeting, a resident spoke out against Mayor Pat Somerville's Memorial Day address at the Memorial Day Parade. It appears that Mayor Somerville decided to use the address to speak out against the war in Iraq.  While both the resident and I agree; the Mayor has the right of free speech, the Mayor also has an ethical responsibility as an elected official not to use these types of addresses for political purposes.  Can you imaging the feelings swelling through the family that just lost their son in Iraq? They were present as were many, many veterans. They stood there in utter silence in the rain, forced to endure the Mayor's political rhetoric when they came to this Memorial Celebration to remember the brave soles who fought and died so that the rest of us can sleep at night.  Shame on you madam Mayor. Shame on you.   I would recommend all that want to remember the true meaning of Memorial Day should read  urlLink this essay   by Kathlena Peebles.

      Regarding the Solid Waste Single Hauler issue: &nbsp;After the vote on the solid waste issue I received a few negative comments from some residents and was berated by a few Council Members so I felt it was important to point out my side of the issue.  I truly believe this is a great idea and it’s time to look at moving to this type of system. It will save wear and tear on our roads and will result in significant savings to our residents.   While the plan that was brought before Council is a relatively good one, it has several flaws that forced me to vote no.  First and foremost is that the plan does not take into consideration the needs of low income families and our seniors. District 4, which I represent, is home to a large contingent of low to moderate income families and many, many seniors.  Prior to the vote on the single hauler issue, I was contacted by numerous residents that don’t even have trash service and would end up paying for the single hauler even though they don’t use the service. Many of the seniors that I talked to only generate about one bag of trash per week. Their neighbors usually just throw that one bag of trash in with their own as a neighborly gesture, others pay their neighbors a small token and some have their children or other family members take care of it.  With the current plan, there is no way to opt out of the contract. Low-income families, seniors, families that are only here for part of the year and business owners that use their business trash are forced to pay for a service they currently do not use.  The second issue is that of accountability. What happens if I have issues with the hauler that has been chosen to service the city? As it stands, if I have an issue with my current hauler, I can tell them to go jump in a lake and can call someone else. With the single hauler plan, I have to call the city and file a complaint. The hauler has to respond to the complaint and while there is a fine that can be imposed on the hauler, the current plan has no definition of who will impose the fine and who decides that the hauler will be fined. Either way, it still doesn’t resolve my issue. I have to wait until many more residents call and complain before the hauler is removed or real action gets taken.  I have proposed a volunteer system that would allow the City to test drive this plan for one year. This gives the hauler an opportunity to show what they can do and it shows the residents how much can be saved and how the system works.  The volunteer system is very simple. The city would send out a letter to every household offering them the opportunity to sign up for the volunteer service. Once the sign up period is over, the city would go to each hauler and ask them to bid on the contract and the contract would be awarded to the lowest bidder.  The remaining features of the plan would then remain in tact. Of course the people participating in the volunteer plan probably won’t gat as large of a discount, but any savings are better than none right? This would still allow the residents that are not sure of the plan to contract with their choice of haulers and would allow the residents that want to utilize the single hauler the opportunity to save. After the first year, the plan could then be reviewed by the Council and any bugs or tweaks that needed to be made could be done to make it a plan that all residents would be happy to participate in.  Unfortunately, the issue may not be looked at since a few Council Members are sour about this proposal being defeated. I can only hope that those championing this idea will look at the alternatives that were presented and agree to continue working on with the issue.

      News Bits  It’s been a while since I last updated the site, I’ve been on summer holiday and a lot of new things have happened.  First off, the people from Rookery Woods a.k.a. RAIZ have been up to it again. Anyone at the Festival of the Hills fireworks should have noticed the two plans they had circling Borden Park. I wonder who is financing their operations. I’m sure they have not registered as a Political Action Committee.  The latest round of Letters to the editors contained more incoherent babble.  Now the group is erroneously claiming that the City is going to give away acres of Riverbend Park to help the REI development. Where do they get this stuff? I mean just how many lies is Bill Windschief going to come up with? Makes you sick to your stomach doesn’t it?  By the way, to complain about the low flying planes disrupting your weekend activities, please call RAIZ at 248.495.2541 or e-mail them at raiz@raiz.wayne47.com.  It seems the Oakland County Republican Party is still in shambles. It appears the Christian Coalition Neo Conservatives are at it again with L. Brooks almost starting a brawl at the Orion Republican Club debate.  urlLink Click here  for the whole story.  You know… I hate to say it, but Brooks is right. With the County Democratic Party such a mess, now is the perfect time for the Republicans to lure disgruntled Democrats to jump ship. Unfortunately, the Moderates and the Neo’s in the Republican Party can’t quite fighting long enough to get their act together. Just goes to show you that we really need a viable third party for the common sense people.  As far as our own local climate… Things are good and things are bad.  The Good: The City is in good shape financially. We still enjoy the 2nd lowest tax rate in the County and our financial rating is still high.  The Bad: Morale amongst city employees is low and the budget process looks disastrous. The City should have a very simple Mission Statement: “To Serve and Protect”. Unfortunately, our police and fire are terribly under-funded and our roads are falling apart. Yet we continue to purchase $75,000.00 pit toilets for our parks and new vehicles for our fleet! The budget really needs an overhaul but the entire process has become a shambles to the point that I don’t even attend the sessions any more.  The way the process is supposed to work is that the Mayor is responsible to submit a balanced budget to the Council at the first meeting in September. Generally, we have meetings to discuss priorities and those issues with the highest priorities get funded first. Unfortunately, more often than not, we have these meetings, Council provides input and the budget comes back looking like Swiss cheese.  If Council was stronger and more united, they have the power granted by the City Charter to modify the budget submitted by the mayor as they see fit before they adopt it. Granted, this is a very difficult task seeing that the budget must be sent to the County and the State within a matter of weeks after the Mayor submits it to Council, but it can be done.  Unfortunately, in the years I have been on Council, the Council as a whole has never voted down a budget and has never made wholesale changes to a budget before adopting it. As for my votes, I have voted in favor of only one budget out of the last six presented.

      What is up with the people in this community that think they can subvert their  personal   responsibility ? No one wants to take responsibility for their words or actions anymore.  For as long as I can remember people in this community have been putting out so called "Anonymous" flyers denouncing the actions of the City or this person running for office or that person. Stealing political signs in the middle of the night, making midnight lit drops the night before an election with unsigned flyers; for what?  Sometimes the flyers are outright lies why would someone put their name on that? Sometimes the flyers have twisted facts on them. But one thing was always missing.  Personal   Responsibility . No one would ever claim the flyers as theirs. I can't blame them. That would allow other people to call them out on their lies and hatred.  Now comes the information age and the ability to use the internet to get your message across. I use it regularly. I often get beat up for what I put on my websites cause I tell it like it is. People don't seem to like it when other people put them down. Then of course these are the same people who put out those nasty-grams.  Most of the time when I get attacked it comes from so called "Anonymous" posters who are just afraid to leave their name. Most of the time the attacks are personal instead of political in nature and that's ok. It's part of the  responsibility  I accepted and it goes with the  personal responsibility  associated with putting my name on something.  People don't mind going down to the Council Chamber and calling me a liar and a crook or any other name they can think of, but boy do they whine and cry when the tables are turned and I fight back! Seems people automatically think you give up your constitutional right to free speech when you become an elected official.    NEWS FLASH  ! I have the same right to call you a liar as you do to call me a liar. Deal with it.  Now it would have been real easy for me to create an anonymous blog and use it to bash all the people I disagree with but in my opinion, that is truly the lowest form of dishonor and despicably that one can stoop to. If I'm going to say something about an issue or a person you can darn well bet I'll sign my name to it.  Now you may disagree with what I have to say and that's fine, say so. But have the honor and accept the  personal   responsibility  of attaching your name to your disagreement. If you are going to hip shoot and make personal attacks under the vail of anonymity then expect the same treatment in return.  There has been no person who has posted a comment on this blog to which they have associated their name that has been personally attacked. I commend the two individuals that   have   posted a comment using their real name. While I may disagree with them, they have at least earned my respect.  Now, if you are going to tag and run like an internet terrorist, leaving personal attacks or disparaging remarks without leaving your name, you are fair game. If you are going to dish it out, you better be willing to take it. I am, but I demand that you accept the  personal   responsibility  that goes with posting your opinions on this blog just as I have.  If you refuse to accept the responsibility, I will take away your right to post comments on  my blog , your comments may be deleted or you may get shot back at.  I hope that through this blog we can have an outlet for people to voice their opinions and concerns, agreement and disagreements and even disparaging remarks as long as YOU are willing to accept the  personal   responsibility  that goes with it.  Peace.

      I have been informed by the Rookery Woods Homeowners Association Secretary that Rookery Woods Homeowners Association is not associated with RAIZ.  "The residents and the Board is opposed to the REI development but it hopes to persuade the council members not coerce them into seeing our point of view. With that said, I hope that in the future you will check with the Rookery Woods Homeowners Association Board members before you accuse us of activities/actions of others. RAIZ is not Rookery Woods and one individual does not a sub-division make. Do not paint all residents of Rookery Woods with a broad brush."  I appreciate these corrections and will be the first to admit any mistakes made in any of my posts. I apologize to the Homeowners Association for associating them with RAIZ. I would however suggest that the Homeowners Association find out why their name is appearing on anonymous flyers being distributed with the RAIZ logo on it if they are not associated with the RAIZ group.

      The following is a poem I received from a Resident and friend of mine. It is republished here with his permission.    THE LADY  When I arrived in New York harbor I saw this lady smile at me She knew I came from far away But now invited me to stay  She said” This land is beautiful and free, Come, stay with us, you’re safe with me” Her smile was warm, her arm raised high It carried a torch, a light high in the sky So that all people could see it And understood why  That was many years ago, and she still stands there, tall A wonderful sight and comfort to all She still welcomes people that come to her shore The poor and the rich and she still asks for more The wonderful lady in the land of the free The lady that stands for our Liberty  Copyright: Gerard Verschueren, July 4th 2004

      Hello &amp; Thanks for visiting my blog. I see word gets around. It's nice to see people visiting and commenting on my posts. While we are on the subject, about posting comments... I am happy to have you post your comments on my blog but I do ask you to be honorable enough to add your name at the end of your post. Comments made without a name are uncredible and have no meaning. Besides, while you have the right to dissent and post your opinion (As I do), I have a right to know who leaves a comment.  Now, about this Blog... This is my blog. If you don't like it, don't read it. If you disagree with me. Fine. Say so but do it with Honor and respect. Leave your name.  Posts that I make to this Blog when under the news heading will be factual. That means I have done everything I can to verify the validity of what I am telling you. If something is my opinion, it will be prefaced that it is my opinion. As you are, I am entitled to my opinion as well. If you don't like it, don't read my Blog or say so, just leave your name.  Now, on with the news. On Wednesday of last week, Council passed the second reading of the sign ordinance. Looks like the books closed on this one. Maybe now we can move on to more important stuff.  Council also balked (Except for Mrs. Holder) on my proposal to ask the voters to amend the Charter in order to allow advisory votes. It always happens at least once a year that someone on Council say we should ask the voters... Only problem is we can't. Unless we change the charter.  Arguments made against this proposal by my fellow Council Members included that, and I quote, "I am better equipped to make the hard decisions than the voters". "If I want the voters opinion I will do a scientific Poll". "The voters put us here to make the tough decisions".  My argument for is that we are here as Council People to express your views. Sometimes it is hard to gauge the views of the entire district or the entire city for that matter. When it is a tough issue, why shouldn't we have the ability to go to the people?  In my opinion, some people get power hungry when they get on the Council and the only way to keep their power is to take it away from the people. I couldn't believe that one of my colleagues actually said that they were better equipped to make the decision than the voters. I couldn't believe it.  Now I understand that in some cases a vulnerability Council may abuse the advisory ballot issue, but then it should be shame on them. You don't hurt an entire community because you are worried about what a Council might do ten years from now.  And of course we had that terrible exciting budget presentation. What's new? Not much besides four new fire department positions. I guess we are not going to police the subdivisions anymore as our Mayor just doesn't seem to care about your personal safety. Again, no positions for police.  Anyway... Some comment leavers seem to think I am somehow tied in with L. Brooks and the Republicans. Sorry, I am a moderate democrat. I just think his war with the Religious Right is funny! I always thought the County Democratic Party was messed up, but the County Republicans can't even get along. It's hilarious.  Anyway, the point I was trying to make was that in my opinion, L. Brooks is right. With the Democratic party so messed up, now is the opportune time for the Republicans to be going after disgruntled Dems. Unfortunately, L. Brooks and his band can't get along with the neoconservative religious right faction of the party and there is a growing number of people (Myself included) that don't want to have anything to do with either party at the moment.  Peace.

      Upcoming issues still not resolved:   Budget presentation August 4, 2004  This year's budget discussions should be interesting as everyone fights for a piece of the budget money. As most of you know by now, I have been and will remain committed to public safety thoughout my tenure on the Council. So I will continue to work to ensure our Police and Fire / EMS needs are represented in the budget.   Charter Amendment  We will be discussing the potential of placing a charter amendment on the November ballot asking if the City should have the ability to place advisory questions on the ballot. This will allow the Council in the future to place issues such as single hauler or solid waste on a ballot to gage how the community feels about these issues. The argument against taken by some Council Members is that's what we are elected for. To make those decisions on behalf of the residents. I don't necessarily agree. I think it is always good to gauge where the community stand on important issues. I don't like the "Hollier than thou" attitude of some Council Members who do not want to let the community have thier input into important issues.   Sign Ordinance  As you may know, last week Council approved modification to the sign ordinance basically grandfathering businesses that existed prior to December 31, 2003 from the requiements of changing to a monument sign unless they change, sell or modify thier business. After our initial discussions on this matter I was not in favor of grandfathering the businesses in. They have had plenty of time to make the changes we required. But as we continued to investigate I found other issues that just were not resolved. I drove through the tire city looking at signs. I met with business owners and discussed the impact the ordinance would have on them. I finally came to the conclusion that the sign ordinance sounded like a good idea at the time, after all, the Council wanted to keep up with the "Jones" and that's what other cities were doing at the time. But when it comes right down to it, it's just a sign. As long as its not falling apart and has some good taste, does it really matter if its a monument sign?  Stay tuned for more info as the budget discussions heat up.  Peace.  G
