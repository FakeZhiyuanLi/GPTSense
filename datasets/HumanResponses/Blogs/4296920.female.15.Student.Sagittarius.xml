      I've decided that until I cant actually like drive and get around myself... I have a lot of time on my hands. I am still very busy, but I still have that long amount of time of like nothing, it's kinda nice just to be stuck at home with nothing to do. I am so thankful I was forced to take computer keyboarding! Not because it has made me a faster typer... it did but I learned more than typing I learned like all kinds of formatting stuff it was such and awesome class. I'd like to take the second year of computer keyboarding and maybe take web design the next year. I don't really know which way I'm going career wise. I've thought about several things. I've always wanted to be a teacher and I really love kids I would have so much fun as a teacher and I think I'd make a good teacher too. I've thought about since I've been taking so many business classes I could just randomly end up with business something. When I think of like a business or office it seems to boring for me I don't know if it would be something I would enjoy, although I might be good at it. Most people don't know this, but my dad (my real dad Bryan isn't really my dad lol everyone thinks he is that's ok he's been more than a dad to me my whole life) anyway.. yea so my dads family owns O'Bryan Trailers I guess that's how you spell it.. and I assume that's the name. Anyway yeah they own those blue trailers you see at like I dunno stores all over Evansville. (o and I took my moms last name but yea.. that's my other side to my family, so I guess I could do some type of office job there. I could work for my step dad he has a business with like loans and stuff I almost worked there this summer but I decided not to. I could move to Hawaii and work at my moms side of the families business called R.Baird Co. I think that's the name I could like do office stuff there. (we buy stuff like all kinds of neat souvenirs and like put Hawaii on them and stuff and sell them to all kinds of stores in Hawaii) I don't know if I could move there though all my family and friends are here for the most part. Some people are like are you kidding I would pick Hawaii it would be so great to live there! Yea, I guess it would for a while but rather quickly it'd get boring and it wouldn't be much of a vacation spot either. There's so many different things for me to do those aren't even all of them I know I'm leaving out a ton! I think I really want to be a teacher though. Blah. Now I am bored again. I keep going through these like computer phases I'll be on forever one week doing one thing then another the next week then let my sister have it basically for a week (it gets so old waiting for the computer and it seems like I wait forever then I feel dumb and guilty because there are so many other better things I can be doing than waiting for the computer) but ya. Its like almost 3 I wasn't tired I came home and slept 4 hours, I planned on going to the game and Ben's but I fell asleep as soon as I got home I was exhausted! Joe called at like 8 and wanted to know when the game was supposed to be over, if he hadn't called I wouldn't have made it to Ben's I would have slept all night. lol I find it really odd that I can't wake up to an alarm or the radio or even TV it just wont wake me up but the phone wakes me up. It's not just cause when someone calls I want to talk to that person that bad that I get up and grab the phone and talk to them. I more than likely don't want to I just woke up I don't know who it is.. I don't really wanna get up to check either its just that ringing noise that wakes me up. lol my dad and sister where watching a movie and that nokia ring kept being played through out the movie and at one point I was like ok whats going on am I like dreaming this or am I really hearing a phone so I like sat up looked at the TV and returned to sleep. My sister told my dad she was like hrm I guess she was right. Before I went to bed I told her I wish I could figure out how to change my alarm on my phone to a more ringtoney sound and she was like why!? and I told her she was like o0.. lol I don't think she believed me. But yea, I'm bored again not too many people are on at 3 am either I think it's just me. I probably should go to sleep St. Louis got my schedule like perfect this is the longest I've been up since before that trip. Okay, well I'm gonna go. Later.
