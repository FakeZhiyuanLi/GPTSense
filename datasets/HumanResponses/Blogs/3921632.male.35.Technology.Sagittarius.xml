       Well, the girls now have six cousins. Audrey  name-to-be-inserted-later  Booth was born at 1:25 pm today at Bellevue Women's Hospital. She weighs 7 lbs. 11 oz. and is 20 inches long. Here are a few snapshots for those who missed the event. (Alright, I suppose you can look even if you were there.)   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic

       I just added my picture to my profile. Unfortunately, it's about the best one I have. Since I usually end up taking the pictures, I'm not in that many of them. This is a good thing, since our camera doesn't have a wide-angle lens.

       We have a  urlLink swimming pool  in our back yard that's a refreshing way to cool off on those hot summer days. Now all we need are some hot summer days, and we'll be all set. Here are the girls and a couple of their cousins trying to look happy while freezing on one of the typical afternoons we've been having.   urlLink Abigail and Margaret   urlLink Micaelyn and Ethan   urlLink Margaret and Abigail   urlLink Micaelyn and Abigail   urlLink Abigail and Ethan   For those of you just joining us, Micaelyn is our older daughter (7 1/2), and Margaret is our younger (almost 6). Abigail and Ethan are their two-year-old cousins. They have three other cousins who have not yet availed themselves of the pool: Stephen (13), Colin (almost 11), and Leah (8). At least I'm pretty sure those are all the right ages. They say the mind is the first thing to go...

       On the Friday before Independence Day, Scotia had their annual fireworks display in Collins Park. (Well, technically, I think it's called Freedom Park, but I've been calling it Collins Park for a couple decades now, and you can't teach an old dog new tricks.) Here are a few snapshots we took. The fireworks came out pretty well for not having the camera on a tripod. I'll be curious to see if any of these links actually work.   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic   urlLink pic

       So I found an  urlLink anagram generator  the other day and decided to plug my name (Michael Ketchen) in. Lo and behold, the first one on the list was  A CHICKEN HELMET . This, of course, is an excellent name for a blog, and since I have had a terrible time finding the motivation to update my home page in the past, I decided to put my acronymic pseudonym to work. Of course, the odds are still pretty slim that I'll continue to find the necessary motivation, but at least this way there's a chance.
