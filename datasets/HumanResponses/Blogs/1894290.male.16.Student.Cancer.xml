      Saw  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy  for the second time yesterday. Damn...its a great movie. The scenes were shot amazingly and the car chase at the end was the best. Very intense and looked very real. I've been trying the find the soundtrack online, and luckily I've found it. YAY!! So hopefully I'll be able to get it soon.

      Well, my day has been extremely exciting. This morning I got my driver's liscence! It went really good. After that, me and my mom went to Wal-Mart and I spent got this super cool steering wheel cover and a cute Sponge Bob air freshener. Of course, seeing a poster stand, I had to buy an Orlando Bloom poster and a Spider-Man 2 poster. I also got the Three Days Grace cd, which I totally am loving. If you're into alternative rock, definetely buy this CD. A few days ago I bought the Bourne Identity DVD, since I'm going to be seeing the Bourne Supremacy tomorrow. I love it. There's this one part that made me jump really high out of my seat. And wow, Matt Damon is pretty hot too :)!!!

      Woo-hoo! I'm finally 16. I can't believe it. I got back this morning from Oklahoma and I am so glad to be home. I am totally beat. My aunt's wedding was beautiful and the reception was a blast. I had a party there and I got mostly jewelry. My aunt and new uncle got me a 14 karat ring with ruby and diamonds in it. My other uncle and aunt gave me a really pretty bracelet. And my grandparents got me a gold necklace. I'm mostly excited about my brand new COMPUTER!!! It has a flat screen which I really like! I'm really excited about it.

      So I rented Bubble Boy today. It is absolutely hilarious! It has this stupid comedy that made me laugh really hard. And, another good thing about this movie is JAKE! He was so cute. I went around town to try and find this movie, but luckily I finally went to Blockbuster and rented it. I'm definetely going to buy this. I also bought The Day After Tomorrow soundtrack. I haven't listened to all of it, but the songs I have listened to are really good. Kinda remind me of the movie...lol. Tomorrow evening I leave to go to my aunts wedding. So I won't be updating as much as I would like.

      I don't know if this is just me, but does anyone else feel like summer hasn't come yet? In Michigan, the temperature has always been no more than 65 degrees and gets pretty chilly at night. I hope the summer heat will be coming soon. I want to go swimming! My family hasn't even opened up our pool. We usually open it over Memorial weekend, but being how retarded the weather has been, we can't. On a lighter note, I watched October Sky last night. I started it at 12AM and it ended around I think 2 or 2:30AM. I really like that movie a lot. It's such a gloomy movie but in the end it gets all happy. I have to go to work today around 5PM, so I'm really looking forward to that, note the sarcasm. The only reason I'm going to keep working there is I get paid extremely well. $8.50 and hour, and I work about 3-4 hours. Only twice a week too. And there are no taxes taken out. So every week I get paid around $45. It's exciting 'cuz I can actually buy stuff w/o asking parents. And, my mom actually had to borrow money. That made me feel happy! Still hoping to see TDAT and Spider-Man 2 soon. I think my dad wants to see both, so maybe he'll take me...

      Yay! I finally have a new blog opened! I'm really excited about it. Hopefully I have time to write in it. Well, nothing really exciting has happened to me. I saw  urlLink Harry Potter 3  yesterday and it was better the first time, for me at least. I was really upset because I wanted to see  urlLink the day after tomorrow  again. I saw it with my friend Sha a couple days ago and we both want to see it again. I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. What made it extra good was the one and only  Jake Gyllenhaal !!! I loved his character. *sighs... Another movie I want to see  again  is  urlLink spider-man 2 . I saw it opening day and have wanted to see it again ever since. I thought it was better then the first one, but that's just me. I had so many favorite parts, I don't even know where to start, so I won't...lol. I'm going to beg my parents to drive me to blockbuster so I can rent bubble boy. Everyone I have talked to say it's really funny. Wish me luck!!
