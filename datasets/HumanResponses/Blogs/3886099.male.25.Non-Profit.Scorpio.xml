      (playing now: NERD- Fly or Die)  As far as I can tell, Bill Clinton's only profession was candidate.  I'm 300 pages deep into  My Life  and most of the non-campaign talk feels like "stuff I did until the next campaign."  Don't get me wrong.  I get the sense that this man was equal parts ambition and idealism.  I suppose that dichotomy also defined the line between his most passionate supporters and his most vehement critics.  David Pryor is mentioned a few times in the book.  I think Senator Pryor brought politics to life for me.  There wasn't a time in my life previous to meeting Senator Pryor that I can remember being passionate about much.  Life was good and I was experiencing it.  After I graduated from Tufts I was on the road with Goat and Mike, going to the conventions- the RNC in Philly and the DNC in LA.  I remember that I was still very skeptical about politics and politicians.  Sometime in the fall of 2000 when UL was picked up by Harvard, I had the opportunity to sit down with him and Cathy McLaughlin.  There is not a single moment that I can identify as when the Senator inspired me, it just happened over time. His character overcame my cynicism.  Fellas, have you ever noticed how so many women look a lot better at work or on a regular day than when they get all dressed up to go out?  Too much makeup, too much hair.  Men and women speak completely different languages.  (now playing- Neptunes Greatest Hits)  "I know that I'm carrying on.  Never mind if I'm showing off.  I was just frontin'."                                       - Pharrell  Hip-Hop is doing big things right now.  It probably would be hard to appreciate the growth in the genre if you just got into it.  Lately, I've been taking time to re-listen to old CD's I bought in college/high school.  Somebody needs to take all the classic, artsy beats and throw modern day artists on them.  E.G.- Kanye over Pharcyde's "Passing Me By."  "...and after 12th grade I went straight to college."                                       - DMC  Mase- Clark Atlanta David Banner- Southern University, U Maryland (Masters level) Talib Kweli- NYU Lauryn Hill- Columbia University Ashanti- got into Princeton Will Smith- got into MIT Ludacris- GA State University DMC- John Jay University  I was fairly disappointed by Fahrenheit 911.  It was definitely entertaining.  Partisan loyalty aside, listening to the POTUS stumble over the obstacle course that is the English language is bunker proof.  Most of the rest was hardly new information.  Chappelle's "Black Bush" was better. I was a little surprised by the way Moore glossed over (read: completely left out) Saddam's troubled history in the region.  The fact of the matter is that Saddam is a brutal dictator who killed his own people and tried to assassinate an American President.  He is arguably more powerful than the world's other brutal dictators because he controls a sizable share of Earth's oil supply. Democratic leaders- to include President Clinton- supported action in Iraq.  Clinton even went on record defending the Bush admin's claims of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities in Iraq.  I just can't believe that the POTUS flat out lied.  I also can't support the way that he blew the international community off and rendered the UN useless.  The UN doesn't need much help making itself useless though.  I am still perplexed by their stance toward the Sudan.  Here is a nation clearly in need of international intervention and support.  Present day Sudan has a wide-ranging and very active slave trade.  Moreover, the oil-rich Darfur region of the country is home to the Janjaweed militias that are slaughtering (at least) tens of thousands of innocent civilians and displacing far more.

      (playing now: Jadakiss- Kiss of Death)  "All us blacks got is sports and entertainment until we even."                                 - Hov  That won't be reality for long.  Jay himself is a testament to the way that the world is changing.  Obviously he made his money as an entertainer but the important bit of nuance here is how much money he was able to accumulate as an entertainer.  Jay, Russell Simmons, Diddy, and Master P are partly responsible for most of the country thinking that $1 million isn't really a lot of money anymore.  When I was a kid a million dollars was the pie in the sky.  That seemed like a ton- more than enough to last a lifetime and buy all the useless material goods I needed.  Now $1 million dollars just isn't what it used to be.  Tonight I saw a commercial for Pepsi's "Win a Billion Dollars" contest.  The advertisement actually poked fun at millionaires by highlighting the benefit of being not rich, but  wealthy .  Apparently when you hit a billion your butler is then authorized to bring in an HR guy and commence a search for his/her scheduler.  I read a book called  The Betrayal of Work  this year that really blew my mind.  The book is a companion to  Nickled and Dimed - the more famous book about America's workers living at the "Federal Poverty Level."  30 million Americans make under $18,000 a year.  Many of them work two jobs, have children, and do not have health care.  Many of them work in the fast food industry or in late night jobs that put them on the front lines of America's war against crime.  Word of advice: if you enjoy McDonald's do not read that book, then read  Fast Food Nation , and then watch  Supersize Me .  I'm off the stuff.  (playing now: Jay Z- The Black Album, 9th Wonder Rmx)   CSPAN is where its at. They have a morning call in show that allows anyone with a phone, a thought and basic cable to call in and air their views. Its like a Complaint Hotline for America.   You wouldn't believe how good the POTUS is in front of a crowd of his own people. He's really improved. He was on fire tonight at a speech he gave in York, PA. We must never forget the mass graves of the people he murdered. That's a quote not an observation. Is that Rick Sanatorum sitting next to Jenna Bush?   Some of the 9th Wonder's tracks are better than the original beats on The Black Album.

      (now playing: Bob Marley- Is This Love)  "My people are projects or jail, never Harvard or Yale."                           - Nas  Today's Boston Globe contains a  urlLink story  about this year's 35th homicide in the city.  Apparently a young man was murdered at a house party this weekend.  Boston has a very low crime rate compared to DC so murders here are fairly big news.  This one, however, was especially gripping.  The young man accused of the murder apparently shot another young man in the back of the head.  After finishing the article and moving on to the rest of the paper, I found myself fixated by this paragraph:  "'He didn't do this,' Nichols's (sic) mother, Marva, said tearfully after he was arraigned. 'He's never been in trouble.' Nichols has no prior record, his lawyer said. He graduated this year from Brockton High School and was planning to attend Howard University in Washington in the fall, his mother said."  There are now more black males in jail than there are in college.  In fact, 1 in 3 black males will be incarcerated in our lifetime.  I was startled to learn that these statistics only reflect trends of the last 20 years.  In 1980, the number of black males in college outnumbered those incarcerated by 250,000.  By 2000 there had nearly been a complete reversal with the number of incarcerated black males exceeding those in college by 190,000.  What was so powerful about the two decades that reversed much of the progress from the civil rights movement?  The 80's and 90's have the dubious distinction of being home to the crack epidemic.  I can not go as far as identifying crack as the single factor that led to our current incarceration rates, but I would argue that it is certainly an accomplice.  Within the same twenty-year span, imprisonment increased eleven fold for drug offenders.  Crack Cocaine ripped through the US and ruined the lives of millions of Americans.  Crack may have been a more powerful epidemic than AIDS in the US because of its ripple effect. For doubters, go check out the documentary about crack airing on HBO for proof of its impact.  My instinct is that the crack invasion combined with President Reagan's "demand-side" pursuit of drug offenders were mostly responsible for removing the black male from college campuses and enrolling him in the penal system.  Obviously, many of those in jail chose to commit crimes and must be held personally responsible for their actions.  However, I question the wisdom of the policies created under the War on Drugs that led to the pursuit of neighborhood drug dealers rather than international drug traffickers.

      (now playing: Anthony Hamilton- Coming Where I'm From)  What happened to  urlLink Jack Ryan  is a shame.  Little more than a month passed from the time that I was introduced to his campaign against  urlLink Barack Obama  until Mr. Ryan was forced to resign.  On the surface, Jack Ryan is exactly the kind of Republican that every Republican and every Democrat should hope for.  His race against State Senator Obama could have been on par with the great political contests in American history.  The personal stories of both men alone were enough to carry this race into the upper echelons of political races.  I would have relished the opportunity to follow and learn from both men.  Unfortunately, the politics of personal destruction reared its ugly head and brought that race to an untimely end.  Jack Ryan was forced to drop out of the race because information was leaked from his divorce regarding racy sexual interactions between he and his ex-wife. Allegedly, Mr. Ryan requested that his wife have sex with him at a sex club in a foreign country in front of an audience of friends.  Indeed, strange behavior but hardly a matter for public outcry.  I could not care less about the sexual interactions between a man and his wife- no matter how strange or foreign they may seem.  Mr. Ryan and his ex-wife did not participate in illegal activity.  Nor, did Mr. Ryan commit an act of adultery or abuse.  Furthermore, Ms. Ryan was not even the source of complaint.  A newspaper filed suit for access to sealed documents from their divorce and then printed a full story on the matter.  From there, "politics as usual" took hold and grew the story into hyperbole and destruction.  When will we demand more?  Every time "politics as usual" controls the system, we lose.  While many Americans say that they want and need more out of government, most of us are content to tolerate the sort of bottom feeding that inevitably pushed Mr. Ryan out of the race.  Because of our complacency, good people are being persuaded to avoid politics and the system continues to be controlled by those that show up.  If it is true that Americans aspire to uphold the values contained in the great American concept, then we must do more.  We must demand a new brand of politics and spend our time in public life fighting for idealism.  We must spend our time fighting the fights that need fighting.

Chairman McAuliffe was in true form yesterday at the "Behind the Scenes" tour of the Fleet Center for the DNC.&nbsp; That guy could sell ice in the winter.&nbsp; Somehow I managed to get on a list of Boston socialites that were invited to a private reception and backstage tour of the convention hall.&nbsp; The CEO of the convention, the Chairwoman and Chairman McAuliffe hosted Boston-area politicos for cocktails, a brief rally, and a trip down to the convention floor.&nbsp; We all got to take pictures on stage behind the podium which were then immediately printed out and brought down as keepsakes.&nbsp;    urlLink Rep. Jeff Sanchez  was there and he hung out for most of the tour.&nbsp; We felt like the little kids on the tour of Willy Wonka's factory.&nbsp; Jeff was so excited.&nbsp; He was snapping away with his digital camera and took at least 4 pictures up on stage.&nbsp; I took two myself- including one with Chairman McAuliffe behind the podium.&nbsp; I just kept telling people: "I'm sorry, please excuse me for being so excited but I'm such a dork and this is like going to Disney World for the first time."   After the tour I headed home to change and then go to a fundraiser for  urlLink Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. &nbsp; A group of young professionals sponsored two fundraisers for him Friday night.&nbsp; He was great, as usual.&nbsp; Harold's the kind of guy that all women want to be with and all men want to be.&nbsp; He's almost more of a celebrity than a politician.&nbsp; However, he also is a sharp guy and a talented legislator.&nbsp; He truly is the future of Democratic politics.&nbsp; He's also a machine.&nbsp; He was still going hard at the fundraiser when I left (around 1 AM) and his scheduled to speak this morning at 9.

      (now playing: John Mayer- Room For Squares)   "You're Not Safe Yet."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Al Capone   Read the 9/11 Commission Report:   urlLink Exec Summary    urlLink Full Report     urlLink Very Funny Bi-Partisan Video    Well, the time has finally come for the nation's ultra-political to turn their attention to Boston.&nbsp; The Democratic National Convention officially begins next week but the events on the fringe have already begun.&nbsp; Check out the forum on PBS today at 5PM broadcast from the  urlLink Institute of Politics .&nbsp; Gwen Iffil is moderating a panel focused on politics/young people/etc.&nbsp; I'm asking the first question.   Four years ago I graduated from  urlLink Tufts  and joined UL as its first full-time staff member.&nbsp; At the time we didn't have any money so I spent the summer blowing through my savings and traveling across the country to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and the Democratic National Convention in LA.&nbsp; Jesse, Mike and I were the only three of our cohort that made it to both but we met up with familiar and friendly faces on each coast. This summer will be similar except that it is now Erin, Jack, Jesse and I and we won't have to leave the East Coast to hit both conventions.   I remember a few things about that summer:   1) It was easier to get into events at the DNC than at the RNC.&nbsp; That may have been because Philly is a Democratic stronghold and the Republicans felt on edge about protesters, etc.&nbsp; LA had a Republican mayor during the DNC but I doubt you can call that city a Republican stronghold.&nbsp; Either way, it seemed that the Dem Party had embraced the Big Tent in a way that the GOP hadn't.   2) It wasn't hard to pick me out of the crowd at the RNC.&nbsp; All of the diversity at the RNC was manufactured- JC Watts as the MC, mariachi bands at the doors, old school conservatives no where to be found.&nbsp; Apparently the Bush campaign stashed all of the old fogey, true conservatives in a sky box.&nbsp; Colin Powell looked a little agitated when he spoke.&nbsp; He got up in front of thousands of die hard Republicans and chastised the party for not supporting Affirmative Action.&nbsp; My mouth was agape.&nbsp; My friends joked that if I played it cool, I might be whisked on stage for the keynote.   3) There was severely limited access for young people to key events and speeches.&nbsp; Most of my friends watched the convention on television from hotels near the convention halls.&nbsp; Parties were mostly limited to those with credentials.&nbsp; We managed to finagle our way into a ton of cool stuff but it takes a severe lack of shame to waltz yourself into a party to which you were not invited.&nbsp;  urlLink Rock the Vote ,  urlLink Youth Service America ,  urlLink Youth Vote , and a couple of other orgs were the only outlet for most dedicated young people.&nbsp; This year, my boy David Burd from DL21C put together a  urlLink youth convention guide .&nbsp; If you're in town, come to our  urlLink Rising Stars  event on Wednesday, the 28th.  It will be interesting to see what has changed in four years.&nbsp; The tone of the campaigns heavily influences the types of events and parties that are planned.&nbsp; Furthermore, having the convention in my hometown will provide a bit of a twist.&nbsp; John Kerry must be excited.&nbsp; Can you imagine a better scenario than accepting the nomination to run for POTUS in your hometown while leading the incumbent in national polls and kicking his tail in fundraising?

      Our Rising Stars event was yesterday.&nbsp; Officially, we hosted 651 people on the Odyssey cruise boat in downtown Boston.&nbsp; The event's purpose was to honor rising stars in politics and host a convention-style party for young people.&nbsp; When I graduated from college in&nbsp;2000&nbsp;I went to both conventions and was frustrated by the lack of access given to young people.&nbsp; Our event opened politics up to young people and provided a diverse space for people to meet, eat, and hear great speeches.&nbsp; It was a resounding success and I am so excited that it turned out well.&nbsp; We have a great team at UL and great supporters.&nbsp; They made this event happen.   We gave awards to some amazing people:  urlLink Samara Barend  (NY),  urlLink Cory Booker  (NJ),  urlLink Matt Brown  (RI),  urlLink Adrea Cabral  (MA), Julian Castro (TX), Joaquin Castro (TX),  urlLink Silvia Delamar  (GA),  urlLink Rachel Kaprielian  (MA),  urlLink Jonathan Miller  (KY),  urlLink Mike Ross  (MA),  urlLink Adrian Fenty  (DC),  urlLink Harold Ford Jr  (TN), and  urlLink Kendrick Meek &nbsp;(FL).   We also built a strong, diverse coalition of support&nbsp; to help drive the event.&nbsp; A woman remarked to me that she was pleased by the diversity.&nbsp; She said that ours did not look like a regular event in Boston.&nbsp; I appreciated hearing that b/c that was my top priority.&nbsp; I go to tons of Boston social events and I am often the only (or one of few) black people in the room.&nbsp; Similarly, if the event has a great deal of minorities, there are very few whites.&nbsp; Any visitor or resident can see that there are two Bostons, divided by Massachusetts Ave.&nbsp; On one side there are limited means and on the other, the resources are limitless.&nbsp; On one side there are black and brown people and on the other, the faces are all white.&nbsp; I live in between and prefer this vantage point because it helps me appreciate Boston in its entirety.&nbsp; It also makes me want to work tirelessly to build a bridge across Mass Ave to help build One Boston.   After our event we all went to a restaurant in Cambridge to watch the speeches.&nbsp; I wanted to see if John Edwards could match Barack's performance from the night before.&nbsp; He didn't.&nbsp; My bet is that they toned down Edwards' speech so John Kerry can steal the show tonight.&nbsp; Even so, I thought Edwards' speech was lackluster.&nbsp; The biggest difference between a guy like Obama and Edwards is that Edwards has to tell you that "hope is on the way" and with Barack you just know it.

      Wednesday was quite an amazing day. Conventions bring politics to life. People that you have only read about, heard about, or seen on television are exposed and available.  Wednesday morning I jumped out of bed to head over to  urlLink City Year  for an event with U2 front man Bono. Bono is one of a few celebrities who I appreciate speaking out about policy matters because he's clearly well educated on those issues and possesses a great deal of political skill. Bono was turned on to the Debt Relief issue a few years ago by  urlLink Professor Jeff Sachs  who left Harvard to teach at Columbia. I heard them speak at Harvard's class day two years ago and I was deeply impressed by this rockstar, turned activist. He started off his speech asking the City Year Corps members how old you had to be to join CY. They informed him that CY started at 17. He replied: "Cool. When I was 17, I joined a Rock and Roll band."  His cause has recently grown from Debt Relief to poverty- now focusing both on debt and the AIDS crisis in Africa. AIDS is not about sex. Everyone has sex but you are 100 times more likely to contract AIDS if you are poor. Bono joined Walter McCarty and a host of policy experts to launch the  urlLink One Campaign  against AIDS. Maria Shriver showed up to show her support.  Facts I learned about AIDS: - There are over 40 million people infected with the virus. - AIDS drugs cost $150/year to distribute.  Some of the reasons used for keeping the drugs out of Africa include: - They are too difficult to use properly, Africans can't tell time... - There is no infrastructure in poor countries for distribution. Duh.  After the event with Bono I got some work done and then, later, headed over to the MA Black Delegation's BBQ in Roxbury. It was good to get out into the real community and see regular people. There wasn't any concern in the air as to what event was next or who was speaking when. These folks were just out to have a good time, eat good food and enjoy the company of people in the neighborhood. They even had local activists registering voters and had tables set up for people to get involved in neighborhood initiatives. I met the woman that organized the event. She told me that she and some of her neighbors came up with the concept and organized the whole thing in an effort to bring the community together.  For my next event I had to choose between seeing  urlLink Gen. Wes Clark  at City Year or going to see  urlLink Congressman John Lewis  speak at the historic African Meeting House on Beacon Hill. I opted for Congressman Lewis. I had never heard him speak before. I was quickly assured that I made the right choice. My friend Kevin Peterson runs the  urlLink New Democracy Coalition  and organized the event to give an award to Congressman Lewis and  urlLink Rev. C.T. Vivian . The first thing I learned is that you can't ask two black civil rights leaders to only speak for 5 minutes. Time restraints mean nothing to preachers.  Rev. Vivian and Congressman Lewis conducted a war of public speaking in that tiny room at the African Meeting House. Their styles are very different but equally engaging and inspiring. If you ever have the opp to see either, please go. Rev. Vivian is a truly impressive man. He is credited with founding Upward Bound and fought with Dr. King during the civil rights movement as a part of SCLC. Congressman Lewis is also a civil rights hero and has inspired so many people to reread history in order to appreciate his struggle. He is very small in stature but speaks with a large, commanding voice that fills the room. Congressman Lewis told his story about his Aunt's "Shotgun House" and "dirt yard." "My Auntie lived in a Shotgun house!" he repeatedly exhorted. Apparently a Shotgun House is a military term that describes very small houses. The houses are so small that you can shoot a shot gun into the front door and the bullets will exit through the back door. Congressman Lewis narrated a powerful collection of stories from his life and compelled the audience to continue to push forward with the movement.  I then went across town for a reception that my dad's firm put together for  urlLink Gov. Ann Richards . Gov. Richards has the dubious distinction of being the candidate that allowed President Bush to ascend to the State House in Texas. Most people agree that without Ann Richards, the President may not have risen to the White House so quickly. Gov. Richards is a truly gifted and talented person. She is brilliant and an amazing public speaker. She told a great story that I will paraphrase for you. Imagine this in a syrupy, slow southern drawl:  "When I was campaigning I met a woman named Ma Smith. She was married to a man named Pa Smith. There was an initiative in Texas to penalize kids for speaking Spanish in school. I asked Ma Smith what she thought about that when I met her and she said: 'If English was good enough for Jesus...its good enough for the children of Texas.' We've learned a lot in Texas since then but there are still some people that believe that Jesus spoke English. Most of them are Republicans and voted for President Bush."  After the Governor's event I moved on to the convention hall for Barack Obama's speech. As you all know, it was amazing. Barack stole the show this year. There aren't many politicians in the country who are arguing the case for America like Barack is doing. Barack didn't play the blame game. He didn't argue that we have to do the public good for the sake of doing good. Barack explained what it means to be an American: you are your brother's keeper. He set a vision that people can understand. He called Americans to strive for a higher purpose and to fulfill the promise of the American concept. Future politicians take note: you can practice "politics as usual" and win or you can fight for America and  inspire . Barack Obama is the best example I can offer right now of what it means to be a United Leader. If you were ever confused, just go  urlLink watch his speech  again because he hit the nail on the head.  After the speech, I went to Barack's party downtown. It was packed. Star Jones and Steve Buscemi were there along with a huge, very diverse crowd if attendees. I've never seen so many people show up for a State Senator's party before. The diversity and energy in the room represented what I see in Barack's candidacy: a new approach to leadership that will build bridges and bring people together.  What an inspiring day.

      (now playing: RHCP- Californication)   I jumped up Monday morning to get work done before heading over to the Hip Hop Service Action Network's rally in Roxbury.&nbsp;  urlLink HSAN  is Russell Simmons' operation to register inner city youths to vote.&nbsp; He brings artists and a team of volunteers to cities across the country to register voters and rally black folks to get involved in politics.&nbsp; My friends Ron Bell and Kevin Peterson- two great brothers working on political awareness in Boston- organized the event with many co-sponsors, etc.&nbsp; I had the opportunity to be backstage during the press conferences, photo ops and warm ups.&nbsp; I felt like a little kid in a candy store.&nbsp; Which rapper do I speak to first!?   You have to understand that I grew up on Hip Hop.&nbsp; My first rap album was Run DMC's Raising Hell.&nbsp; I took the record (still on wax back then) from my dad and listened to it until the needle on his player broke.&nbsp; I know just about every word that Run spit on that album.&nbsp; The US is going to change a great deal when the Hip Hop generation gets into government.&nbsp; I told Kevin Lyles and Lloyd Banks that yesterday.&nbsp; I also spoke to Run and Russell Simmons, Farnsworth Bentley (he said: "I prefer to be called Mr. Bentley"), Loon, Wyclef, Jerry Wonder, and Memphis Bleek (who performed).&nbsp; Jerry Wonder (after some pestering) had his limo driver get me a "Wyclef for President" t-shirt which you'll soon see me sporting at an event near you.   I was proud to hear Russell, Run, Clef, etc articulate solid views about politics and social action.&nbsp; Those guys get it and really want to make a difference.&nbsp; I used to be against merging celebrity with politics b/c I thought it was an easy out for people that didn't want to do the hard work of transforming government.&nbsp; I now realize that government needs spokesman and champions just like consumer products do.&nbsp; Young black kids trust Lloyd Banks and Kanye West, not "Johnny Politician" in a suit and tie.   Next, I dashed across town to attend a forum with Rev. Jesse Jackson, Jesse Jr., and a host of smart folks talking about the need for a  urlLink Constitutional Amendment to protect the right to vote .&nbsp; The right to vote is not explicitly protected in the constitution- its protection&nbsp;is implied.&nbsp; In fact, there is no record of a positive right to vote in the Constitution, only protection against negative infringements on your right.&nbsp; Congressman Jackson, Jr. is introducing legislation to get an amendment passed to ensure that all citizens have the right to vote and that the right is not subject to interpretation.&nbsp; This is the kind of legislation that popped up after the 2000 election.   Congressman Jackson has a sound point, if not a solid case for an Amendment.&nbsp; The lawyers and legal scholars that I've spoken with agree that there is no explicit right to vote but they insist that we can trust that the right is implied and protected.&nbsp; My concern is that judgments like Gore v. Bush happen when you leave people to interpret a right that should not need interpretation.&nbsp; Voting is not a issue of federalism.&nbsp; Voting is a federal right and is sometimes administered through states.&nbsp; It is the manner through which we ensure a democratic and free society and should be given every protection necessary.   Dennis Kusinich surprised the crowd by showing up and giving a good speech.&nbsp; Although he was good and got the crowd alive, Rev. Jackson was far better.&nbsp; There are very few public speakers of his caliber.&nbsp; I love to listen to the Reverend and agree with him on a number of points.&nbsp; Yesterday was the first time I've heard him talk about the real divide in America- socioeconomics.&nbsp; Race is certainly still a predictor of the equality gap in America but the real divide here and abroad is financial.&nbsp; The poor in this country- white and black- are being failed by the promise of equal opportunity.&nbsp; We truly do live in two Americas.&nbsp; I lived in both growing up and I know the difference in opportunity.   Later that day I went to a reception in honor of my friend Sec. Dan Glickman.&nbsp; Glickman was a US Congressman from Kansas, then the Sec. of Agriculture under Clinton, and most recently the Director of the IOP.&nbsp; He is now the head of the Motion Picture Association of America.&nbsp; He also serves on UL's board and is a friend/mentor.&nbsp; Glickman's reception was the usual fare- free booze, tons of free food, and good people.&nbsp;   I had the opportunity to speak with  urlLink Jack Valenti  for 20 minutes.&nbsp; He's the man!&nbsp; Mr. Valenti spoke to me about the need for young people to run for office, the importance of service and the qualities of great public speakers.&nbsp; He might be in the top 5 of public speakers that I've ever heard.&nbsp; He's only about 5'4" but he speaks with a deep, passionate voice that fills the room. I met Bob Johnson of BET on the way out.&nbsp; I didn't really get into anything with him so my only observation is that he's very short.   I also ran into  urlLink Gavin Newsome , the newly elected Mayor of San Francisco.&nbsp; I've been reading up on him a lot lately.&nbsp; Mayor Newsome is a sharp guy and seems to be the next great hope in the Dem Party.&nbsp; I heard he's an avid bball player so I introduced myself and then proceed to trash talk to him about my skills on the court.&nbsp; I told him that I heard his jumper is soft and that he couldn't check me on the perimeter.&nbsp; He's 6'4" though so he'd probably just dunk on me and send me home.   The late night event last night was a party at Vinalia (a local bar) that Chairman McAuliffe threw for young professionals in the area.&nbsp; Honestly, this was a let down.&nbsp; The Chairman never showed up so he didn't dance as he had promised last weekend.&nbsp; The crowd was mostly socialite, climbers looking to be seen.&nbsp; I find it hard to relax in places where it seems like every couple has "no immediate plans to seek the presidency."&nbsp; Despite the odd vibe at the party, I did enjoy myself.&nbsp; The best part was getting all of my friends to flip their party bracelets over so they looked like VIP and we could all hang out in that section together.   Tuesday is looking good: Bono, Barack Obama, Rep. John Lewis, Gen. Wes Clark and more....

      (now playing: mix of new radio singles)   State Senator Barack Obama was on Meet The Press Sunday morning.&nbsp; I can't tell you how big of a fan I am of Barack.&nbsp; He's giving the key note at the convention on Tuesday night.&nbsp; That should be great.&nbsp; This will be Barack's coming out party- his first real national audience.&nbsp; He's also throwing a real party the night after his speech.&nbsp; That should be on fire if he does well at the convention.   Day 3 (Sunday) of the convention was a great way to lead into the actual, formal convention activity.&nbsp; Up until this point, most of the events were smallish, warm up events- the calm before the storm.   I started the day at&nbsp;a Hip Hop/Political symposium&nbsp;in Cambridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;The event was a pilot of a TV show that Comedy Central is considering running.&nbsp; The format&nbsp;sounds familiar- entertainers on a panel&nbsp;discussing politics.&nbsp; You can imagine that there is a lot that can go wrong with a panel of actors/musicians/comedians talking about policy.&nbsp; I've been to a number of events of this sort.&nbsp; They usually have similar components: far-left ideology, patronizing finger pointing,&nbsp;and tons of incorrect information about policy and politics.&nbsp; This&nbsp;one was no different.   DL Hughley&nbsp;hosted the panel&nbsp;as a late substitution for Dave Chappelle.&nbsp; I feel like the quality of the discussion would have been drastically improved with Chappelle.&nbsp; DL doesn't really know much about politics and spent time advocating racial profiling of Arabs/Middle Eastern-looking people in his monologue.&nbsp; Ben Affleck even went as far to tell a story about being searched at an airport security check point while 5 Arab men passed through unsearched.&nbsp; He wondered why the security folks had the gall to search him.&nbsp; He clearly wasn't a potential threat. He is white after all.&nbsp; Danny Glover was the best panelist.&nbsp; He gave clear, concise and mostly factual points while articulating his opinions.&nbsp; He also looked agitated most of the time as if DL, etc were wasting his time.   After the panel I met up with congressional candidate and UL Rising Star,  urlLink Samara Barend .&nbsp; Sam and I are friends from graduate school.&nbsp; She spent her last year splitting time between class and campaigning in Up State NY for the 29th Congressional District.&nbsp; Sam's no joke.&nbsp; She currently has more  urlLink cash on hand  for her campaign than the two Republicans in the other primary combined.&nbsp; She's a social entrepreneur and advocate who wrote federal legislation that will bring millions of dollars and jobs to her district.&nbsp; Before school she also ran&nbsp;Senator Clinton's Up State campaign.&nbsp; On the way out of the hotel, we ran into President and Senator Clinton.&nbsp; The Senator jumped out of her caravan to talk to Sam about her race which gave me an opportunity to speak to and shake hands with President Clinton.&nbsp; That made up for having to sit through that panel discussion earlier.   A little later I went to a reception at the Kennedy School for Harvard Alumni in public service.&nbsp; Among the crowd of staunch Democrats was the "no spin" man himself-  urlLink Bill O'Reilly .&nbsp; My boy Daniel took a picture with him and we spoke briefly.&nbsp; I held back the urge to tell him that both of his books were a waste of paper.&nbsp; The reception was hosted by KSG Dean David Ellwood, Harvard President Larry Summers, and IOP Director Dan Glickman.&nbsp; Glickman was just named the head of the Motion Picture Association of America so he's a big draw at events this week.&nbsp; It was interesting to watch the crowd interact.&nbsp; It felt much like a high school reunion.&nbsp; There were a number of people in attendance to show everyone how much of a big shot they had become.&nbsp; There was another crew that was clearly there to eat and drink all the free booze available.&nbsp; The second crew is much more fun to chat with.   That night GAIN and Rock The Vote threw a party at Boston's biggest club- Avalon.&nbsp; Rock the Vote throws&nbsp;great parties.&nbsp; Right after walking in the club, I ran into Jerry Springer who was on the way out.&nbsp; I yelled: "Jerry!" and he came over, shook my hand, thanked me (for what I don't know) and proceeded out of the door.&nbsp; After a few cups of free  urlLink Primary Berry  ice cream, we walked into the main room where there was a giant stage set up.&nbsp; Natalie Portman took the stage for a short speech and was followed by the Kerry and Edwards daughters.&nbsp; Chairman Terry McAuliffe also spoke.&nbsp; There was a rumor that Diddy was in the building.&nbsp; That was shortly confirmed by my friend who apparently took Tequila shots with him.   After the speeches, Biz Markie came out to spin a two hour set of pure energy and great music.&nbsp; Biz is one of the best party DJ's in the world.&nbsp; He had over 2000 people singing along to oldies, dancing, and going crazy every time he dropped the needle on a new track.&nbsp; I lost my voice trying to keep up.&nbsp; Midway through the set, Biz brought Al Sharpton on stage with Fat Joe's "Lean Back" playing.&nbsp; Al proceeded to stroll on stage and "do tha Rockaway."&nbsp; I'm not kidding.&nbsp; Big Al Sharpton actually got on stage and leaned back which sent the crowd into a frenzy.&nbsp; He then gave a great speech before telling the crowd to get ready to give President Bush "the big pay back" at which point Biz (in perfect synch) dropped the needle on James Brown's The Big Pay Back.&nbsp; The crowd went nuts.   After that, we pretty much waited around for an hour or more.&nbsp; The rumor was that Lauryn Hill, Beyonce, and Bill Clinton were on the way.&nbsp; No one would leave Avalon even though there wasn't really any entertainment for fear of missing any of the three.&nbsp; In the end Lauryn showed up at 2 am, came on stage, played one (exceptional) song and then bounced.&nbsp; People were pretty disappointed about that but I was happy to have been able to see Lauryn live before she went back to her undisclosed location.   Monday will be a big day.&nbsp; Russell Simmons and the Hip Hop Action Summit are in town with a ton of rappers and Terry McAuliffe's big party for young people is that night.

      (now playing: music performances from Chappelle Show)   Not a terribly eventful day for me.&nbsp; Culture Fest- an all day festival at City Hall Plaza- was postponed due to rain.&nbsp; I did make it to&nbsp;an event honoring  urlLink Gov. Bill Richardson  though.   Governor Richardson was my early favorite for Vice President.&nbsp; He's Hispanic, a sensible centrist, and seems like a good guy.&nbsp; He also went to Tufts and taught at the KSG so I have a sense of loyalty.&nbsp; He is serving as the Chair of the convention and has been to Boston several times this year working hard.&nbsp; As usual, he was impressive in person.

      (now watching: Sportcenter Old School w/ Dan Patrick and Craig Kilborn)  Today's Boston Globe is carrying a  urlLink piece on Airport Security  that I found interesting. Apparently, Logan Airport is becoming the forth airport in the nation to introduce a "safe flier" program. Frequent fliers on American Airlines have the option to receive safe flier "smart cards" after submitting to a background check and allowing their fingerprints and irises to be scanned. Those that opt into the program will be able to skip security screening lines and enjoy pre-9/11 travel ease. This is similar to a policy recommendation I made in 2001 in an  urlLink Op-Ed  I wrote for Politixgroup.com.  This is the funniest political ad I've ever seen.  urlLink Will Farrell imitating the President.
