      YW pulled my hair!!!! i mean, we haven't talk like, in ages, and she just came and pulled my hair!!!???  We used to be friends. To me, she's a good friend. but maybe she didn't think the same about me, though. i mean, nowadays, we don't talk much and whenever we have the chance, i just blurt something not so nice. i mean, i was trying to be sarcastic, here!   i'm always like that to people who i regard as a good friend anyway...  Okay, so i was not that mad that she pulled my hair. but she didn't look so happy...actually, kinda angry (i mean seriously angry) when i told her to go and die...  But that was what we used to talk like! (or at least, how i talk like to best friends) Maybe i'm around shirley too much...  I'm actually kinda glad that she make an attempt to err, interact again, but why does she have to pull my hair? i'm soooo very sensative about my hair. i mean, you can tease me about everything and i'll still laugh my head off, but if you touch my hair, you're gonna be sooooo dead.  i'm worried that she'll take the 'go and die' comment seriously. she did look upset. Arrrghhhhh. (Rika bangs her head on the table)  Maybe i should keep my mouth shut next time. Or at least try not to act too familiar. You know, she's a really nice friend and all, i just wonder how or, why we drift apart this year. *sigh* i really want to talk to her like we used to again. but oh well.   i honestly sincerely truthfully and really, really hope she's not angry.

      E finally talk to her dream guy, okay, a guy she want to befriend with. She was sooo exited. You know, from what she told me, it was kinda dramatic. i wonder what'll happen...  Anyway, today was a lousy day. i wonder why the heck did i go to school today. There's absolutely nothing to do! i almost slept in Prof. Binns' class.   But then again, i found out that someone cared. Not that bad after all.

      Ya know, i found out lately that i'm a lousy friend. Don't mind my earlier post, i was too thick-headed to know that time. Or admit it, maybe.   I dont't know what to do when a friend of mine is sad, i don't really care when another friend is sick. Honestly! i mean, i know i should've care, but i don't feel it and that's it.   Does that qualify me as a lousy friend?   Ya but then, i don't care and how could i be? i mean, it's not like you want to care for someone, you pretend that you do. i believe it should come from the heart. And that's the problem.   How could I make myself care for someone? I was really really bad and selfish when i was a kid and what i'm trying to say is, i never care either. So how could i care or should i say, start to learn how to care at the age of 14?   i know that's not an excuse. but then, i'm trying to make myself feel better, here!   You know, there was this friend last year (she transferred to another school already) who i have a feeling will be a really close friend one day. *shrug* you know how it ends. We're kinda alike. i wonder if we hadn't try so hard to protect ourselves, where will we be, right here, right now?

      Okay, so i take back the time when i said something like this,  "Why can't i just get sick for a day or two so i actually have a reason to skip school and lie around all day?"  i sooo regret that. i was sick today and it's absolutely not fun. Maybe i'll just make up a new excuse when i want to skip school.   Anyway, i finally feel like writing my Power rangers fic. Hope that i'll actually write something and not delete it because i think it's not perfect.   Speaking of perfect, i just found out recently that i'm a perfectionist (100%). i read about it in a book called 'what's wrong with being too good?' or at least, something like that. That explains why i always ask so much from those closest to me.   Ya know, i always thought that i was only a perfectionist when it come to writing. *sigh* it just has to be like this everytime.   Note to self: The ones closest to you are humans too, so they are allowed to be imperfect. &nbsp;  You can be imperfect sometimes too, remember. (what? i have to start  somewhere !)

      Went to jbtalks just now. Only talk about Convent pretty girls...no fun.   Had the stupid KH today...I still can't believe I'm going to make a blouse with colar that's supposed to be lower than my butt. I don't make sense, do I? Well, neither do the teachers, then.  I still haven't post the entry. Heck, I didn't even print it! Almost deadline...*sigh*  Shou le wo de shou bei dang zhen tou ni si bu si guan...  Sorry, his song's again.   You know, I was wondering today...not that I'm attention-grabbing/pathetic/melancholic (yew)... but I try to be a good friend. I listen, I joke, I talk, I care, I notice.   But when I'm feeling blue...I can't seem to find someone in the spot I'm always in. A friend that cares, I mean. Again, I'm not trying to gain your pity or something...it's just, I notice, ya know. Is it fair?   I'm just kinda frustrated. I know I was a good for nothing brat&nbsp; a few years back and I try to make up for it, I swear!   But is it worth it? Trying to be a better friend, i mean. They're not there when I need them...I don't think they even notice.   Ergh, why is it always this complicated?   Sometime i even wish i am still the good for nothing brat that i once was. At least, i didn't care back then. but then again...  *sigh*

      i hate periods.   It made me lost my appetite just now. which is a sin! :( i'm in a really really bad mood.   There's always Ou De Yang's song, though. it has a knack of making you smile (Wu Wei Xiong).  There're tons of homework recently. i mean, what's up with those teachers? It's not like it's all our work, they have to mark it too! So why bother?  Ok, i admit i'm wasting both my money and time by staring off space while updating my blog. yap, don't do it again.  You know, i think it's quite funny that my friend has a crush on one of her classmate from tuition classes. But then, comepare to her, i have no life. Social life, i mean.   But there's NO WAY i'm going to tuition classes just to have a life. Who's that stupid anyway? i mean, as if our homework from school alone is not enough.   I want to learn how to play err...flute (or something like that). It looks sooo cool!!! Oh well, another class on SUNDAY MORNING. There's a word call afternoon you know? Try and tell a school about that. Or the stupid flute class. Or even Tv studios (who air all the good shows on morning, or else late night).   Life seems so boring and tiring lately. Oh well, Don't worry, be happy, they say.

      i was just listening to Ou De Yang's Gu Dan Bei Ban Qui (something like, lonely north hemisphere). Man, the song was so great.   Shao le wo de shou bei dang zhen tou ni si bu si guan ni de wang yuan jing wang bu dao wo bei ban qiu de gu dan  (Without my hand as a pillow do you feel strange your binoculas/telescope can't see my loneliness in the&nbsp;north hemisphere)   &nbsp;i was like, wow, and got all dreamy. yap, love him already.

      I think I'm too mean too my mum. *sigh* Again, a Libra thing.  &nbsp; I don't know, I just couldn't help it. I vaguely remember a time that I'll tell her everything and can actually be comfortable and be myself whenever I'm around her. It seem so long ago and I'm only 14!  &nbsp; I don't know how come I feel like this but I just couldn't be myself whenever I'm around her these days. Sometimes, I caught her staring at me with this face, as if she's not please with me and I'll get fidgety.&nbsp; &nbsp; And it feels like she likes my brother more. She pay more attention to him and buy him lots of trading cards. Things that I gave her, she'll think it's from her  son .  &nbsp; I have to resist the urge to roll my eyes evrytime she says, "I'm very fair to my children, you know." I wonder if she knows.  &nbsp; Sometimes, she praised my brother as if he just won some world title or something. I just couldn't stand her looking at him with those dreamy eyes and often,I just retort kinda...err, nastily. Unwise, yeah I know. I just couldn't help it. Now&nbsp;I just keep my mouth shut.  &nbsp; Yeah, back to the mean thing. On the other hand, I know she works hard so that she could earn more money for our family. But everytime when she's not working, she'll just play with her PDA. That's why I feel closer to my dad. And that's why I feel guilty whenever I talk back.  &nbsp; I don't know her anymore. Or should I say, she doesn't know me anymore. *sigh* &nbsp; But no matter what, she's still my mother and I realise I didn't say 'I love you' in a long time. It's kinda awkward, now that I'm 14.  &nbsp; So, between you and me, I love my mum. Shh, don't tell her!

      Well, after a good night sleep...I became so cheerful that I become bored. Know what i mean? At least i can think about suicide when I'm depressed. Now i'm so cheerful and cannot think of something angsty. *sigh* &nbsp; I think I'm too cruel to my best friend (A). It's a Libra thing. I expect too much from my friends I guess.  &nbsp; But then, a person like A...it's just... &nbsp; Yay! I got depressed already! (??)

       I used to believe that Professor Binns (Harry Potter's History of Magic professor) is just a comic relief and does not EXIST in real life.     &nbsp;  And then (as you might have guessed), i met one.     &nbsp;  (I'll refer him as X here)    &nbsp;  You won't believe how much X remind me of Prof. Binns. I mean, nobody is listening in his class and he just carry on! He's practically talking to himself!!! *sigh* I miss my teachers in my primary school (note: gasp!!!).    &nbsp;  They's so much more dedicated, hardworking and actully care if we learnt anything at all! Ok, so the homework they gave us weren't exactly...little, but hey, i got this far because of them!    &nbsp;  I know, we should study by ourselves but maybe they should give us the time to study! *cough* Instead of hiring a teacher who talks to himself and wasting our time...    &nbsp;  Yap, not so cheerful today...

      'Talent is the strenght of believing in your dreams,'                                      -----Superyoyo, Seto's mother   I want to believe it you know. But for a person as realistic as i am? It's kinda hard. Okay, very hard. Really hard. If things are only as easy as beliving in dreams...  But then again, I'm having problem believing aren't I?   I want to become a writer. Some of my friends said I have talent in writing (in Chinese), but I don't feel like it you know? I couldn't find the right words, descriptions are always the same, and I think I write in English better. See how bad I am?  Actually, (as you might have guess), being a writer is not just an ambition, it's my dream. The only one that I put serious thought in it.   Yet in these days, as from a 14-year-old's POV, you have to make a living. You're expected to know how. You were told to study science, to become a lawyer, a doctor, a (note: succesful) businessman. Writer? You just have to starve to death!  I am stuck. I wonder if i should follow my dreams, or try to 'make a living (plus big money)'.   I try to weigh those two options, but how could I?   Jack Miller once said, "we added years to life but not life to years". I don't want to 'make a living' but not having a life. I don't want to starve to death, either.   Yes, if you have what it takes, being a writer can both 'make a living' and have a life, like JK Rowling.   I don't know. Do i have the talent? Do i have what it takes? I wonder who can tell me.   Sounds like I put too much thought in it do I? Well, it's not like I'm struggling between life and death, my friends will tell you that I'm the don't-worry-be-happy type. Believe me, it's just the way i think.   Well, for now...where's my pillow?

      i'm bored.  yeah, so the exams are over, but i still have that stupid folio to do...  but then again, now that i think of it, a lot seem to happen today.  First, i slept really well last night. and i don't want to wake up. okay, so i don't want to wake up almost everyday, but today, it really felt different.  Next, in school, i actually continued my story--qing tian. And actually let other people read it. R they all made me laugh. now i really want to continue that story. but still, i feel it's kinda cliche.  Okay, so before that, i had another inspiration. yeah, of her traveling to another dimension (the dimension where the fanfic Destiny took place, i've been reading it lately and kinda like it). and has to face her worst fear---killing Gary over and over again. i'm evil, right?  Then, YW came and told me something the card i gave her last year was taken (it was in her wallet, and she lost her wallet) by a St, Joseph guy...big deal. but yeah, i'm really happy that we talked. now that i think of it, i'm not really a socialable person, seeing that it was her who came and talk to me everytime. i really had to try someday, it's kinda unfair to her.  And shirley and i actually had a discussion on my story. wow, that's new. but still, it just doesn't fit. her suggestions are really angsty, that is, more angsty than mine.  there's a what, school annivesery or something tomorrow, i kinda want to go. but between Gundam Seed and school?? i'm not stupid.  nothing interesting happened after i came home. except...okay, i don't want to talk about it.  well, busy day, ain't it?

      It's the second selaras exam and here i am, updating my blog. i mean, no big deal. (even though it's KH and science tomorrow....*sigh*)  i found out about Wellington High yesterday. it's in New Zealand. i so very want to go. i mean, their school is so cool! No uniforms, library open for use, and computers, and of course, lockers (=no heavy bags!!!) And we can actually choose our subjects.  Ya know, yesterday i kept imagining about going to WH. i mean, i always wanted to go overseas to study (high school, people!), but at least i don't have to go to an international school in NZ. There're many students from all over the world, i was told.  Okay, honestly? i don't like it here. So boring and no this, no that. Not to mention all those stupid racist teachers. 'Muhibah', they say, my foot!! i think we are even more racist than other countries, you know. i mean, in US, at least, you hang out with blacks, it's normal. Here, if you hang out with malays or indians, they'll keep staring at you like you're a freak. Especially the teachers. Yeah, all students allowed, but when it come to selecting the prefects or something, all students from chinese school go to hell. and they kept saying about muhibah....  And the stupid weather. Not to mention the stupid uniforms. and the school is so damn strict!  i mean, we can't even bring story books!  Okay, correction, i think i HATE it here. If someday i'm going to other places (not China), and if i met racists, yeah, i won't mind. But this is my home god damn it!  It costs RM30,000 a year. yeah, i saved it for the last thing to check. Now i can't even think about it. Maybe i really should write a book. How else can i make RM30,000 while i'm still in high school?  Anyway, nice timing. i have another idea for a story. yeah, nice timing. I haven't even touch my books yet. About the Little Prince.  i have another of those daydreams of mine, where the book become a bestseller, i went to NZ to study, not to mention all those 14-year-old writer stiff. ha, as if.  But i can try right? yap, i'm going to write that book. and see if i can get publish and make RM30,000 before i turn 16/17.  Current Target/Goal: Make the god damn RM30,000 by 2006.

      Ya know, my parents use to joke that if they ever divorce, they would want nothing to do with us (me and my brother). Sometimes, i just couldn't help but wonder if it's true.  Unrealistic, i know. i just think about it in times like these.  i don't know if she (my mum) notices it or not (but she had to), there's a really huge gap between us. Even is she does, i don't think she's doing anything about it.  i mean, i try to, at least. i try to do something with her, she just keep discouraging me. i wonder what is it like to feel your own child to grow away from you. If it was me (not that i want to marry and have kids), i would want to reach out, and maybe at least try to bridge the gap. But to me, it seems that she just gave up, instead of trying to.. you know.  Why is it like that then?  i couldn't have been that bad. It's not like i'm trying to escape from her or something like that. i, for one, is absolutely willing to have a close mother-daughter relationship.  i know we have different interests, and i'm not trying to influence her or anything, the least she can do is at least be more supportive, instead of acting like she didn't care.  i used to think mothers have to be you know, like those describe in books, but even now that i undestand that mums and dads are, indeed, humans too. i still couldn't help but think...never mind.  i really, really want to have a mum who i can talk to. Not one that i have to avoid.
