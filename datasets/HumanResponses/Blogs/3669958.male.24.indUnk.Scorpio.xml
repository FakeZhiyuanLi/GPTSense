      Hello.. I've been quite depressed lately, and I have no idea really why. I guess that's the downfall of being a woman. Sometimes you get really depressed or really happy, and there's no explanation as to why you're so up or down. Well, boys and girls, I hate it! So here's what's been going on in my life: Friday morning my mom dropped my kitten Stitch, and Cat Sibby off to the vet, and later on that day I called in to check on them, and my favorite nurse is joking about how badly she wants my kitten. Well, At first I'm really excited because no matter how much I love my kitty, we've just got way to many animals. GC's friend was moving out of state and left us Stitch, and we--especially me--fell deeply in love with Stitch. But GC has been complaining that 3 cats and a dog is too much work, and even though I cant even think of parting with any of them, He is right. I have to make a compromise though. We cant give away Sprite, nor Harrah. Harrah has only been with us 7 months, but this baby is my angel. I love her and Sprite with my whole heart and soul. I feel such a connection with them both. I think GC is going to keep Sibby, his baby.  So anyways, Here comes the most perfect opportunity for Stitch. CJ is the director of the vet office, and she is truly the only person I'd trust whole-heartedly giving Stitch to. She has showed so much love to me and my babies for years, and I know that if she takes stitch, it will be the best thing for her and him. Me and GC have talked, and we've decided we'll give Stitch to her. Now, I just have to keep my broken heart from spilling into too many tears when I say goodbye or I'll keep him, possibly make things harder on GC, and take away Stitch's one REALLY great chance for a truly, good home. My poor Sibby, Sprite and Harrah the most, are gonna miss him terribly. But sometimes you have to do what you have to do.. Or atleast that's what I'm telling myself to try to keep my emotions from taking over.. The worst thing, last night he curled up on my neck while I was asleep, he put his little head on my face and slept with me a long time. He made me feel so loved, and I guess he made me feel like the right thing is to give CJ the little kitty she now loves as much as we do.  Now I have to go before I start to cry. Too late..

      Hey guys, I'm gonna get right to the point this time... I'm never eating ARBY'S AGAIN!  Two nights ago, GC and I shared a Turkey, Bacon, & Ranch Marketfresh sandwich from there and last night we both got sick. Here's what happened... Here's the Dilly-O! LOL! We just ordered food last night--Of course GC ordered Chinese like always, and I ordered from a local pizza place--we had just sat down to eat, and taken a few bites each and the next thing I know GC is in the restroom. We had both complained of our tummies growling a few hours before, but we both didn't really feel like eating. So, of course, I ask him, "Are you okay, baby?" He says he's not, and that he's sick to his stomach. RIGHT after I asked him that, Suddenly I got sick! Lemme just say it wasn't puke we were feeling... *hint hint!* LOL!!! **Embarrased as hell** So we only have one bathroom, and I start screaming at him saying that I have to go NOW! It was the worst feeling ever!! So poor GC comes to the rescue, and carries me to the restroom, and I'm in there no more than a minute and he's saying he has to go again! It was horrible! As soon as I felt a little better, I went right to bed. I remember having the same annoying dream over and over and I didn't sleep well. I wake up at 5 a.m., and again I'm sick. It started for us again. Poor GC had to go to work today, since he started a new job, and as he was walking out the door we agreed that both our tummies were burning bad! I never feel like eating again!  Now.. Let us proceed to the next issue of the morning! **Clears throat** So, GC is getting stuff ready for me as he's about to leave for work. He goes to the fridge and he yells, "Shit!" He told me the fridge had popped open in the night and all our food got warm!:( Our take out which we only took a few bites out of was gone, and everything else, eggs, milk, you name it. I was so angry! Why you ask? "It's just a fridge! It's just food!" You might say. I'm angry because it seems like everything is broken or not working properly in this house! The stupid fridge will close but within a few second--every now and again--the damn thing just pops open all of a sudden! Stupid fridge... On to he next hot issue... **clears throat and bangs on chest** Ouch.. Sheesh! See, when GC is gone I'm usually at the computer since I'm waiting on a new wheelchair. So, I'm pretty much left in one spot. Let's hope for no fires. LOL! Okay.. That really isn't a joke.. kinda scary actually... but ANYWAYS!!!!!!!! So My computer monitor just stopped working today. *POOF!* likes its unplugged from the computer. So he twiddles with it, fixes it, and right as he was walking out the door it does it again. I'm panicking of course, because if it goes out in the middle of the day, I'M SCREWED People!! But luckily it hasn't gone out yet... **knocks on wood**  Well.. Okay, So, um, Yah, I'm done ranting on my blog for now. Thank you for sticking with me through all my silly posts. Place a comment, I have so many stories to tell LOL, lemme know what kind you wanna hear! Once I think of something to write, I type FAST! So Help me get started!  Well, Since my first hour of the day was horrible--Yes it all happened within an hour of me waking up--I think I'm gonna try really hard to have a good day while my tummy goes on hurting.  Hope you all have a good day too.

      This weekend was one of the laziest ones I've had in a long time. I hate when this happens because usually when I have nothing better to do I end up doing the following... 1. Breaking a rib 2. Hurting bad from arthritis because nothing to keep my mind occupied 3. Rebreak something else that just healed..  So you see, I tried really hard this weekend to be REALLY careful as I did not what to rebreak my collarbone that has just finally stopped popping and moving around. I have been REALLY careful I think. I hope atleast, the next few days will be the real test! GC started a new job today, he seems to really like it. Its good we need the extra money.. Shoot EVERYONE needs the extra money! Haha! I've been really excited lately about getting back to school. I was going to go to a world renowned cooking school in Scottsdale, Arizona. I was even accepted, actually but I think I was only really kidding myself. Yes, cooking is my passion. Mainly Pastries and Baking, but its so much easier to do that at home than to do that full time in a commercial style kitchen. One thing, commercial style kitchens for those that have never seen one are TALL. Everything is standard size, meaning 36" or higher. Its almost impossible to reach anything in those type of kitchens. We had this master plan all sorted out, but I realized I was only kidding myself. I've decided to turn down the chance to go to the Scottsdale Culinary Institute and instead I'll go with my 2nd passion. Graphic Design. I've been doing amateur design myself at home with Photoshop and the like, but when I started looking into the schools I got really excited. First of all I'd be getting a real degree, B.A. instead of a certificate at SCI. Second, Graphic design also lets me be creative which I am all about. I am a real crafts/artsy girl. I like doing all the things housewives like to do! LOL. I love to sew, cross-stitch, knit, paint, draw, etc. I'd get to take lots of drawing and painting classes, and of course all general education which I'm really excited about. I've been out of school for 3 years now, and I've been really depressed about that. I really enjoy learning and seeing all my old friends going to school and getting degrees already made me feel pretty worthless. I had a pretty bad experience in high school and its REALLY made me scared to go to college even though GC tells me its so different. I wanna be like GC, I want a B.A. I wanna be smart like him! hehe! I'm looking into a lot of schools right now, but there is one that I REALLY want to go to! The Art Institute. I love the offered classes, but you wouldn't believe the price to go!! Yikes! I just pray every time I think of school that my parents will help me pay for it since I'd really be doing something I CAN do.  Well.. I'm getting too excited, and now I'm off to look at some more schools! I'll post my art on here a little later! Or just make an ART blog. Either way show you some of my art soon! Take care everyone!

      Hello again!  Seems like I sometimes dread Friday nights. There is nothing to do here EVER! It sucks. I hate living in the Midwest. There are no big cities to party in, no beaches to hang out at. All the clubs feature country music, and trust me the list goes on and on. Its kinda cute when my mom and dad tell me of all the stuff there is to do here in BORINGVILLE but I guess me and GC have different preferences when it comes to having fun! I wanna party!! I wanna go out, listen to loud music, drink, and have fun! Now I should say, I am only a social drinker, and smoker. I know, I know, Smoking is bad, I've heard it time and time again from GC and seriously after this pack I'm done. I've kept this pack now for over a month, so you can see I'm clearly not addicted. I just like to smoke when I'm having fun!? Nothing wrong with that! Anyways.. So here I am sitting on my couch cross-stitching a present for my mom, looking like some old lady doing her hobby, and the doorbell rings! Thank god, LD and MB came over to hang out. We just chilled, watched TV, then they went home about 30 mins ago to get to bed early before we all head out for a day at the park tomorrow with our dogs, while the boys play basketball.  I'll post a picture of my dog, Harrah. She is 7 1/2 months old, she and my 3 cats are the loves of my life, including GC of course! :) So I've sat around all night, cross-stitching, playing with Harrah, watching TV, and posting on my blog.  What a great frickin' Friday! *sigh* Oh well.. I guess I'll get back to finishing up my mom's gift. Sorry for such a boring post!  I'm out!

      I'd like to first start off telling you about my night last night. My best friend, LD, recently moved back to town, and I think I've been the happiest with her return. She and her boyfriend came over last night and we had the best time. Her boyfriend, MB and my boyfriend GC were playing ESPN NBA 2k4. LD and I on the other hand were playing Skip-Bo, a game we used to play even as kids when she used to come over my house. It was a blast. I think I laughed so hard all night that I broke a rib! LOL! Fun times, fun times! Okay, so I've been thinking for the last few days about what to write about. Its actually been pretty difficult to think about this since I have so many things I have to tell. I guess I'll tell you about my broken bones, and stuff like that! When I break a bone, the average person thinks I am the strongest person with such a high pain tolerance--Except my dad, I think he's the only person I know that has felt as much pain as me. He's broken almost everything, Huh Dad? :) I may have the yr wrong but the last time I remember going to the doctor for a cast, was when my dad picked me up from school in... 5th? Grade after I broke my arm at lunch time. After that my mommy became my doctor. We slowly started this collection of splints, braces, slings, collarbone braces, Ace bandages, etc. (I'll have GC take a picture of my current set for you guys.) My mom was the best "Doctor" I'd ever had. She was so gentle, and if I told her it hurt she'd stop. I'd usually take a day or two in bed or relaxing at home before I was out and about again.  EXCEPT, when I broke a leg. That was painful! I remember having to lay in bed the entire time for it to heal. I'd usually have to go on home studies from school to continue my education and not fall behind. One time I broke my femur, and of course I stayed in bed for a few weeks, and after a while the pain went away, but I could still feel this funny feeling in my leg, like it was moving in a way it shouldn't be moving. Well regardless, I felt NO pain whatsoever and I went back to school (My leg was still splinted up because of the movement.) and I even went to stay the night with friends, and my friend used to pick me up and sometimes help me rewrap my leg and everything. Well after about a month of this my mom decided it was time to get it X-Ray'd. Well, imagine the surprise to find out my leg WAS still broken and the bone was separated about an inch apart!! My friend who came with me almost started to cry, and my poor mom felt so bad. I couldn't help but laugh, I just couldn't believe that I had gotten so used to the pain I didn't even feel it anymore! Sometimes I think my pain is really bad. But when others see how I'm dealing they tell me I'm so strong. I guess I have a pain tolerance that I really don't see.  Well, I'm gonna end this now because GC, is setting up the picture of my "Do it yourself Cast Kit" Lol. I'll post it as soon as he takes it!

      Hello again! I woke up not too long ago.. Well maybe an hour or two.. Yah I stay up late, cant seem to get my sleeping schedule right when I've got a broken bone! (Currently have a broken collarbone!)   Okay so anyways, I don't know what it could possibly be, but I always have the most vivid, and sometimes very scary dreams. They are so strange. They jump around so often at times, that I cant even tell someone what it was about because the story changes 10 times. I have always wondered why some people can have such types of dreams, yet others cant remember if they've had dreams or not? Is it something we eat? Is it because we don't go to bed with a full stomach? Are we just more gifted into seeing these dreams for what they are? I honestly have no idea.  My most scary dreams are the recurring dreams. And its not just one, but several that I get every now and then. Like me and my sister Ashley out in the country walking on a long dirt road. Then all of a sudden there are little tornados everywhere. We have no where to go. Its so scary! They move around like those little ones in the movie twister! I guess I've seen and been around enough tornados in my life that it just kind of stays with you if you are scared enough of them.   Another really scary one is sort of of like the movies  28 Days Later , and  Gremlins  (I think). We're at this hospital, me and about 10 other people. And for some reason the majority of it is empty, and trashed. We cant figure out why? We're on like the 30th floor of the building. And someone screams and tells us to hide. So we all do, and there is this huge beast, like a cross between a werewolf and gremlin trying frantically to find us. He has these HUGE claws, and huge teeth covered in green slime. Its so realistic looking though. He has incredible strength, and we keep moving from place to place trying to hide from him.   But the weird thing that I cant quite comprehend at all is the way I can change my dreams any way I wish. This only happens if it is a recurring dream. I have to have the dreams several times to know the outcome. But once I have it like the 4th or 5th time, I can change it any way I please! Its great. I don't know if anyone understands what that's like, but to have power over your dreams... Its unbelievable!   And the last thing I'd like to point out is this. In 98% of my dreams, I am walking. It feels so realistic. Sometimes after a really vivid dream, I can wake up and for a split second I almost feel like I can get up out of bed. Its so odd when I have a dream when I'm in my wheelchair, and it usually only lasts a small part of the dream before I'm up and walking again. I wonder if walking in my dreams fulfills some of my desire to walk, because right now in my life, if someone could wave a magic wand, and I would be cured, I would NOT want to walk. Yes, I'd like my OI cured, and I'd sure like to have my arthritis pain go away, but walking.. Nah! I've only ever known how to be in a wheelchair, and only recently have I've been able to accept my disability 100%!  Well, damn, its lightening and thundering bad outside! I better go before it a tornado comes and sweeps me away to Oz! (or before the lightening takes out my power and this is lost!)

         Hello everyone. Thank you very much for taking the time to read my blog. I hope you find it interesting, and I hope you will keep coming back and checking up on me. I guess let me start off by telling you all a little about me. My main reason for this blog is  to share things with my friends and family that I normally wouldn't tell them. Also, I want others to know what its like to live with OI, and I also hope to meet others with OI. I feel bad telling them about my pain, sorrow, depression, or even happiness but I have a hard time telling people how I feel when it has to come from my mouth. I have a much easier time telling them when I can write it down. I can put more truth, and emotion in a letter... if that makes sense. I am a 21 year old, living in the USA. My name is Amanda. I was born with a rare genetic disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta. When I was born back in 1982, this was actually a very rare disease. I cried constantly from the moment my mother gave birth to me. My mom was worried when I cried instead of eating, and soon she told the doctors that she felt something was wrong with me. She was right, and upon examination, and several x-rays later they found out I had broken both my legs.     Of course the accusations went around, and they tried to say my mom had abused me, and when that didn't hold, they tried to blame the nurses that were in charge of my care. I am not quite sure how the test came about, but they ended up doing a test on me, and it proved I had Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a brittle bone disease. They instructed my mom and dad to put me into an institution saying that I would never be able to live the life of a "normal" child. I am never quite sure if I've taken the time to say thank you to my mom for not sending me there... I'll take that opportunity now.  Mom, Thank you so very much for knowing that you could raise me to be "Normal". You did the best job anyone could have done, better than some damn institution. You and Dad (my step-dad) are the best parents! I love you both so much!      Growing up was hard, I really don't have many memories being out of a cast. I was always breaking something. I know how hard that must have been on my mom, always having to see me in pain. It used to break my heart when I was hurt because I could see in her eyes that her heart was hurting as badly as my bones were, if not worse. As I got older, the breaks started to lessen, and at one time I went 3 years without a broken bone--not incuding ribs, those break all the time. I was in a car accident when I was 13, and I broke 13 bones, that was the worst 4 months of my life. I laid in a hospital bed the entire summer.      Things have gotten better over the years, and I've done a lot of research on the  urlLink Official Osteogenesis Imperfecta website . I found out that even though I have suffered through so many breaks, and so much pain in my life, I actually have Type 4 OI, which is the least common type. It means that I do have the short-stature, and the bent or bowed bones, and of course many breaks as a child, but as I get older, the breaks become less frequent, and usually only happen to ribs, collarbones, wrists, and toes. Of course, you can imagine my happiness to learn that I WASN'T as bad off as I thought I was, but I was sad at how bad most people with OI are.      There's a lot that goes on in my body due to OI, and I'm sure I'll share more of that in other posts, and there is a lot that goes on in my day to day life that I feel is influenced by my disease. My decisions in life, education, love, etc. You'll hear more about all this later on.      Well, I think I'll end this for now. This is a lot to read, and I think I'll leave the rest of the info and stories in their own posts! Thank you so much for reading this.      .o*o.Amanda.o*o.
