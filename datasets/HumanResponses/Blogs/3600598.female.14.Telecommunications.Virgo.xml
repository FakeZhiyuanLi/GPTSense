        You have an animal soul! Arent you lucky! You are very interactive with animals and can understand them even if you dont speak their tongue. The birds arent afraid of you, deer can eat out of your palm, and every dog will roll over for you. As an Animal Soul, you follow your instinct, sometimes making rash decisions, and not thinking properly. If you dont understand something, you reject and push it away, and can get very disastrous when angry. At the same time, youre a very kind person who can make people feel better, and are understanding and compassionate. One of the great things about you is that your rarely jealous, and know that you have to share and help other people if you want to survive this world. You are very loyal and optimistic, and can make it through the toughest times.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses? (For Girls only) Incredible Anime Pictures!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Hey All!! well today was actually really boring!  i tried to make the best of it tho.  My sis went off to 6 flags, my mom went to get her surgery and my dad was... im not sure. some where. lol, then me and my dad went to pick my mom up and we were like hitting eachother in the waiting room with crutches. lol it was fun and people were staring at us. finally after waiting for an hour my mom came out and she looked drunk it was so funny! she asked the doctor if she could take the cast thing off and he said yes, then like 2 minutes later she asked again- haha.  Well then i came home and did like nothing!!! seriously i was so bored! then...after having boston market for a week, lunch AND dinner, mrs. henderson (jessica madsens mom) drops by and gives us this HUGE and i mean HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE boston market dinner!!  i was like omg!!! lol it was still really good.

      hello friends! haha little bill says that. ne ways.... today was pretty good.  I got to see my friends! i woke up at like 10:30 and was pretty disapointed my alarm clock didnt go off because i really wanted to go to church.  mom why didnt u wake me up?!  then i got up and cleaned my room a little and ate french toast! it was so good after eating bowls of cocoa puffs for a week :)  then  i went back to sleep and woke up at around 12.  then i cleaned some more and then family came over and then at 6 i went to the main street chapel and we worshiped and some people shared their testimony for the week, and then we watched the slide show!  it was actually a lot of fun!! then i came home and went to Twigs and we hung out and now im here.  and im actually really tired. my moms getting surgery on her foot tomorrow.  it blows invigorously.  She cant get out of bed for a week except for the bathroom.  and then she cant drive for 6 WEEKS! ahh.  im gonna have to grocery shop with my bro b/c my dads at work all day! yikes. well pray that it will heal fast.  well  i think im gonna go nightnight.  and like natalie im gonna have a bible verse of the day.  Phillipians 2:14-15 Do everything without complaining or argueing, so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation in which you shine like stars in the universe.  Guys- just if your given a job or a chore to do, try and do it w/ out complaining. b/c on the missions trip i learned you'll get no where if you complain or argue and everything will be better and go faster w/ out complaining or argueing.  Ahaba .*.Li

      even tho i dont really want to be.  The past week was so amazing!  Ill tell you guys everything! :)  Sunday: So we get to the church load the vans and go.  We get to New Hope Bible church and boys go take their stuff down stairs- ours upstairs.  Then we ate pizza and hung out.  It was actually a lot of fun.  Then we worshiped... sorry guys but if wasnt the best worship... lets just say the singer didnt have the best voice... i know i know- Ephesians 4:29  haha.  but then we found out our team names and our team was Sana'a!  Lol its soo fun to say!! are team was awesome!! we had Joan, G, Dan, Will, Lindsey 1, Lindsey 2, Scotty, Me Rachel, Dana, Corey and Ryan.  So then we make these boards with little slots and u put ur name on them and people write u "encouragment cards".  ha it was a lot of fun.  Then we went to sleep and the next day...  Monday:  our team was off to H.O.M.E. ( Housing Oppurtunities and Maintenance for the Elderly)  We were pretty syked b/c it was our first site.  Well we get lost and end up and hour late.  But man that car ride was soo fun!! haha.  Ryan and Corey would not stop making fun of my nose... lol and then we past this sign that said: African Hair Braiding.  lol and Ryan goes Alfredo hair braiding?  haha omg it was the funniest thing ever.  We made fun of him the whole day.  haha.  well we finally got there and we had a ton of jobs to do.  some people mowed the lawn, some picked weeds, some vacuumed, but me dana and rachel got to clean the doors and mop 10 flights of stairs!  yep it was a work out. then we came home probly went to the convienent... meh.  Tuesday: well tuesday was pretty awesome.  We got to go to THE Cabrini Green.  it was so cool, like if you've  ever seen Hardball the movie where the little boy got beat up- i saw it.   It was amazing to actually be in Cabrini Green.  But what we were soo excited for was that we got  to be w/ little kids.  So we get there and the kids arent there yet so we get a tour of the kids club and then they take us over to the building where we got to work until the kids got there from school.  So we went into this big building that smelled like dust and old stuff.  and we got to tape up paper and plastic on doors and windows for when they painted it the next day.  then we swept and mopped and other dirty work.  Then we went across the street to kids club.  well there were already two groups over there. one from texas and one from iowa.  i didnt like them very much. so we're all excited that we get to be w/ kids but then we find out they were going to the beach.  we wanted to go but we couldnt :( we were all really bummed out.  So then we're about to leave and we want a picture on the playground.  So we all get on top and these to little ADORABLE black boys around 4 yrs old come running up and we ask if they wanna be in the picture and so they hopped in. one of them came right next to me and i asked if he wanted to sit on my lap.  he said no. haha.  then right after the picture was taked he hugged me soooo hard and started kissisg my face and wouldnt let go and he was like a monkey climbing all over me.  lol it was soo funny yet sad at the same time b/c those kids crave love so much that they come up to complete and total strangers and just give them a huge hug.     Wednesday: Well lets just say wednesday wasnt my favorite place.  We went to CCIL (Community Christian Industrial League) We got put in the garage sorta thing JAM PACKED with stuff.  it was soo gross.  we had to organize it and clean and sort clothes.  We sorted these two bags of clothes- one mens suits and another womans clothes.  So we take them over to the little store thing and the guy tells us he doesnt like them and we should just throw them away.  So we put them in the van to take the New Hope.  Then we took a ton of these old computers and threw em in the dumpster and we were smashing them... or trying to. lol they are like anti break.  its crazy!  but what was cool was that we got soooo much done and accomplished so much and it felt really good on the inside even tho the outside was tired and in pain.  Thursday: Well thursday was okay...  we went to the Caring Closet.  Its a resale shop. and let me just say- if you guys think resale shops are nasty and have weird things in them let me tell you- you havnt seen anything.  right when u walked in there was racks of clothes just smashed together so you could barely even shop.  then u went downstairs to the nasty smelly basement where we got to work.  and all that stuff was actually free.  it was for the really poor people who couldnt even afford clothes.  But the fun part was- it was like playing dress up the whole time.  We found weird skirts and coats and dresses, it was so fun.  We found this shirt that said: Does your vorpal blade go snicker-snack?  haha it was so funny but i guess u had to be there.  but ya then we took a break and went over to a burger king.  Its not very fun walking into an all black people burger king with 11 other white people with you.  But meh.  then there was this homeless man asking for change so me and Dana bought him to burgers.  Poor guy.  but guys- if you give stuff to the homeless or resale shops and stuff, dont give away the old ripped crappy stuff.  because you dont know what its like going through tons and tons of bags and saying- who in the right mind would even think someone- even a homeless person- would wear this.  Some were stained or ripped or just so crappy.  its sad to think someone was like well this is crappy ill give it to charity.    Friday:  friday!!!!!! best day EVER!! So friday, we go to Leif Ericson school.  We were expecting helping out in classrooms and stuff but we found out it was their last day of school so they were all having parties.  so we took garbage pickers and stuff and went outside where all the kids were and picked up trash... well that only worked for about 5 minutes and then the kids just would walk up to you- not knowing one thing about you and saying:  Can i have a piggy back?  or just feeling someone all of a sudden holding your hand and then u look down and see a little kid you've never met saying hi whats ur name?  it was so fun!  i was so tired tho- i have never given so many piggy back rides!! Then we went to the after school program which was basically on the playground and i hung out with a lot of kids! they were precious!  some of my favorites were, anthony, caleb, cayon, brandy, cadarius, ah they were all just soo cute.  cayon was soo funny!  he was such a little punk.  but i had sooo much fun that day! then we went back to New Hope and then got our shirts and went to NAVY PIER!!! it was sooo fun!! me meri shaw and dan rode the ferris wheel. it was so fun!!!! aaaaaah!    Saturday... aka today :( well today we woke up and some people went to the beach and some went to the zoo.  me, jenny, meri, and rachel went to the zoo.  we had so much fun getting hyper and running around.  omg so fun!! well then we went straight home from there. well all that stuff was definately not everything.  SOOO much more went on.  that was probably the best week of my life.  i seriously didnt want to go home, i would have stayed the whole week.  well i already miss it :(  but im gonna go shower because i havnt taken a warm shower for a week, mostly COLD!!! ahh well bye people!!  God Bless and remember... Ephesians 4:29!! haha .*.Li

      Hey guys!! Well its saturday mornin and im wide awake! i had a softball game this mornin at 9 but we had to be there at  8:30... well lets just say i didnt wake up til 8:30 so my team was all mad at me lol.  too bad :)  Well we lost... but oh well, it was too early ne ways.  I have to ump a game at two.  i really dont wanna.  It blows big time.  if you ump and wanna be my best friend in the world give me a call :)  Right... so last night.  i went down town w/ ju nel and nat and jordan E.  It was a lot of fun!  then we went to jordans house- man his room is awesome!! haha its HUGE!! so then while we're in his room he calls Kel, who has matt and krish over.  So he tells them to come over but doesnt tell them that we were over. so we get the bright idea to hide in jordans closet while the guys comeover.  So here we are in jordans closet(which is actually pretty big)  and the boys come up to his room.  OMG let me tell you- it was SOOOOO funny!! i couldnt stop laughing!! i was afraid they'd hear me~!  so then jordan starts asking questions and saying stuff so that the other guys would talk about us and stuff! omg they said some pretty mean stuff... but then jordan goes man you guys should check out my closet~ its pretty awesome!! lol so kel comes over and opens it and then freaks out and shuts it and so we all pop out and OMG!!!!! kel and kristians faces- they were PRICELESS.  lol i would seriously PAY money to get a picture of it.  They were TERRIFIED!!! haha that definately made my day!! lol, so then ju and jess came over to my house and we were home alone and doing nothing, thenwe had a water fight with squirt guns and hoses, then arm comes over.  Then the munchkins came back from the movies...so we walked to jessicas house.  Then we walked to kristians soccer game in SHORT skirts lol, we embarassed the hell out of him... and his coach yelled at us... hehe:)  So then we walked downtown and just kinda walked and then called jordan E who had corey and matt over.  So we walked over there... we thought it would be a "better" idea to go to the side of his house and throw wood chips at his window... so we're walking and i trip over this huge white gutter- how could i not see it?! lol it was pretty funny.  so then we just went to the door and we went to his awesome kick butt room.  We watched... my babys daddy...  haha.  Ya so then i went home... to where 9 THIRD GRADERS WERE SLEEPING OVER!  omg i do not remember being THAT weird in third grade!  im sitting in the kitchen and i hear: everywhere we go... EVERYWHERE WE GOOOO people want to know... PEOPLE WANT TO KNOOOOW who we are... WHO WE AAAAAAAARE so we tell them... SO WE TELL THEEMMM WE ARE THE LLAMAS! MIGHTY MIGHTY LLAMAS!!!!!!!!! omgomgomomg it was sooo weird!! and then they started to actually  play  "Llamas.   haha it was great.  so i come downstairs and go online... and like three of them come over and start to watch me type! lol and they were reading it outloud!!! haha i was like okay... go away.... and i was so afraid one of my friends would swear lol.  but finally they left.  so i went to bed and now its SATURDAY!!! and i really wana do somthing b/c im leaving tomorrow for missions trip!!!!! ahhh well i def wrote A LOT.  byebye  ~Li~
