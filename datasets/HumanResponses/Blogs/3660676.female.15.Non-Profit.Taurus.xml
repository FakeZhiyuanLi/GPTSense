      it's not the fact that my mom is insain that bugs me so much. she's a dry-drunk, and she has menopause and she had a crappy childhood and she's never really gotten therapy for it. its perfectly normal that she would act this way. the frustrating part is that i can't cut her out of my life, as im not 18 yet. and i cant just leave and go live with my dad, because my birthdad is dead. but i'm talking to kellen online now and that makes everything easier. i love him so much. i cant wait till he gets back. he's coming back early. wednesday. i cant wait!!! anyway..that's all for now. peace.

      so i went to hang out with kellen on thursday. i met him at third place books. he came out of the store, handed me a flower, gave me a hug and asked me if i would go out with him. it was the sweetest thing ever. god he makes me so happy. im so in love with him. shawn and becca keep telling me that im not in love with him because i've only known him for a week and all. i hate when people tell me that. they arent me so how would they know!!! and becca and shawn have such a bad attitude towards my relationship with kellen. i know i talk about him a lot but they dont have to make such a goddamned big deal out of it. they dont just laugh it off or roll their eyes, but they freak out and they don't even listen to me. that's fine i guess, it's really no one's business about me and kellen. i dunno it just gets anoying. i don't ditch them for him or anything! and i know theyre happy for me and everything but i wish they didnt have to be so pissy about it. i wanted to borrow shawn's cell phone to try to call kellen at lunch today and she was like 'oh, well if you're calling him then no, you cant use it', and she took it away. becca's more understanding. she doesnt freak out and get all pissy when i mention kellen. but god! at least dom isnt like that. probably because she knows kellen and she knows how kickass he is. god i owe her my soul for introducing me to him. y'know, teenagers are mean to eachother. friends are SO different then boyfriends or girlfriends. girlfriends and boyfriends care about eachother. my friends and i kind of treat echother like shit. sometimes. not in a mean way, we just don't really ask how people are doing. at least it feels that way sometimes. i dunno i'm just anoyed because my friends are all pissy when i mention kell. becca's okay. shawn freeks. i dont know why. but whatever. i still love my friends! we had lots of fun today making noises at strangers in the u-district. i even got flipped off by some emo kid. rawr. anywho..i guess i'm done for now. i should probably eat something but i dont want to. food discusts me. like my reflection. OH NOW THAT IS EMO FOR YOU!!! weiner.
