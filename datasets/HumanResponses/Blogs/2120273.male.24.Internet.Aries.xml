						   Wow...It seems like only two short days ago that it seemed impossible, this idea of me having a blog--and yet today it is more true than ever. How can this be?!?  Do I need to explain myself? Who am I exactly? What am I doing on the internet machine that is so damn special that I deserve my own 'blog'?    What I'd really like to do is have an erotic blog. I'm not sure how to go about such a thing. I'd ask one of my erotically oriented friends, but I have none. No friends!

						    urlLink    Have you checked out www.richardpryor.com yet?  It's such a most radical website; I discovered it months and months ago when it was just Richard Pryor's blog, but now it's updated, and you can download hilarious audio, order some awesome Pryor product, check out tons of cool photos from his personal collection, read his online diary(containing such gem lines as 'George W Bush looks like he hasn't got pussy since the last time he did a line'), and indulge in discourse on a message board with his wife Jennifer Lee-Pryor and other "Pry-heads", as they're called. It is currently my favourite thing about the internet.  The bullshit MS disease is hard for him, but he's still a sharp and hilarious guy.   As for me, my friend Eunice is in town, and we're having fun. That may be a lie. Actually, I think I'm showing her a horrific time.  Yesterday, I took her to the Adam Macfawn birthday roast at The Old York Tavern, where the delightful Pee On Me(hotly representin'!) and her pals and family were the main audience, and it had enough harsh moments for me to question the validity of comedy in general. I wanted to go to various indie concerts and events also occuring yesterday, but this roast wound up taking longer than I thought. Still, it was A.M's b-day, and he is a nice man who I was glad to see the man turn 32.  Other things of note: the smoking of opiates, my friendly neighbourhood coffee shop, The Green Room, freaking out visitors, humourous polaroids being taken of my cat, platonic spooning, the combination smell of antiperspirant and perspiration, and unfulfilled promises of watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVDs. I have some bullshitty work to do. Working makes me so angry. At the top of this entry is a picture of Eunice and me and her pal Dan whilst in "The City".    I'll write more about the shows maybe in a lil tiny while. I can't wait to play with grungy upstarts the Catheters at some Loft party tomorrow. I feel so hip playing at a loft.

						    AIDS   Just wanted to grab your attention. It's 3 PM, I'm in my bathrobe and it's a weekday. Something seems wrong that this is my daily lifestyle. Perhaps depressed? But why? Maybe it's because of the Mideast situation. Maybe after I masturbate I'll discover the reason. My May 2-4 was alright, but kinda too broke to be fun. Still, I drank a Mai Thai at some point and that was good. Also told jokes. At least I think they were jokes. So many other dudes were telling jokes that night that i don't even remember my gags. I may have said something about cats with scabies.  Dunno.   I really want to write a work of fiction--maybe I should start with the 2000 election? Hahahaha. Ehhhh.  Here's some shows I be playing soon. Comment and let me know if I should print my Brutal Knights lyrics up in herrre.   Thursday-8 PM-Hot Box Cafe-Roach O Rama-Kensington Market-$5  Thursday 10 PM-Poor Alex-Brunswick south of bloor-PWYC   Saturday-Opening for Adam Mcfawn around 9@The Old York on Tecumseth south of King  Monday, May 31-The Loft-1266 Queen st. W-Buzzer 1-Opening for The Catheters, who rock, and The Sour Keys as well as Look What You Did  I'm also setting up mad june and July shows. It's all very fucking exciting. Sweet words about those coming right up, beeytches.

						   Right now I should be eating lunch at a Velvet Revolver press conference, but instead I'm just in my house, scared to leave. I fear the outside world, because it makes me want to smoke.  Also, how on Earth could I possibly tear myself away from listening to the new Lionel Richie album "Just for You"? I couldn't.  Hey, if you went to the Poor Alex in hopes to see some comedy of mine, you were probably stymied, as I did not perform last night. I am booked for next week though. So, to break it down, here's some upcoming shows:   Sunday May 23-Old York Tavern-930 PM start-free-south of King on Tecumseth  This is another semi-open mic, so expect a lot of comedians, and probably a Holly Jones joke. I think comedians like to dare themselves to tell stuff like Holly Jones jokes to make them feel like 'yeah I could be edgy if I wanted to. I have no fear!' I actually think most of my tasteless jokes are meant to highlight our fears and not show that I have none. Doth that make sense? I wouldn't even know how to write a Holly Jones joke. I do have a friend who accidentally ate cake while sitting on her memorial spot outside of a church.  I guess I digressed. More shows:    Roach-O-Rama-Kensington Mkt-Thursday May 27-8PM-$5  The last time I was there, it was odd but fun. The kind of place that has one sketchy heckler shouting non-sequiters, which somehow highlights the comedian's unecessary role in society.  That same day...   Poor Alex Theatre-Brunswick south of Bloor-Thursday May 27-10 PM-PWYC-  I like this room, and it's near my house. Perhaps this is true of you also? Probably the funniest booked open stage in the city at the moment, but I have a bad sense of humour so what do I know?   The Loft-somewhere on Dufferin-opening for THE CATHETERS and THE SOURKEYS-$6-9PM-Sunday May 31  Excited about this one. A rock show. I like the Catheters.  Have no idea what or where exactly the Loft is, but as long as there is brew present I will burp.     I did a set at an open mic the other night. It was well received. I hate the atmosphere of most open mics. I really think it should be illegal to have more than five comedians in the same room at the same time. The thing I hate about comedians is they all either obviously cry too much or not at all.

						   I got a massage for fifteen dollars today. Unfortunately, the only thing it made erect was my posture, and not even for long.  I'll be doing a set on wednesday the 19(tomorrow) around 10 PM at the ancient thai(i think it's been since renamed), which is on queen street, east of tecumseth and west of niagara on the south side,  at an open mic. Admission is gratuit. As of now, no jokes for it have been writ.

						    I, Douchebag   Weblogs are strictly for douchebags. So, is it a coincidence that I have one?  Sadly, no. I, douchebag.  To wit:  1. I have slapped a girl before. That's a technical foul!It definitely goes in the basket filled with reasons why I'm a douchebag.   2. I can't hold my alcohol.   3. I'm a music critic. Case closed! The only thing more douchebaggy than being a music critic is being a white musician. Wait, I'm that too. Huge douche.   4. I claim to be a white musician and yet I know not how to play any instruments. Basically, my musical training consists of knowing how to count. Also, not white but half Jewish. I think that renders me some sort of mulatto!  Commentz or questionz?

						   I am allergic to jobs. OK, that's not true. The truth is that most jobs are allergic to me, and to my particular ways and foibles.  I worked as an assistant to a famed booker in my hometown of T-Dot, and I did that OK, but the pay was sporadic at best. Then I got this writing job, and I feel like I'm pretty decent at the writing part, but semi-shoddy at the 'getting facts straight and doing the artist you're writing about/reviewing justice' department.  In between those two jobs, I had a three day stretch as a telemarketer that failed. And now, onto my newest flop.   A couple of weeks ago a friend of mine got me a job at a bar she worked at. I worked four shifts, and was ready to work my fifth today(truthfully, shitting my pants hoping it would rain so I wasn't needed, because I prefer not to leave the house if I don't have to), when I received a phone call from my boss informing me that he was 'letting me go', because it 'just wasn't working out', even though I'm a 'nice guy'.  This event is a good reminder that it is bad to count your chickens before they're hatched, and more than that, I think it proves that one should never try to do anything ever.  I have some shows coming up comedically. Also, the band I'm in has, I believe, chosen a name. We have taken the nom de plume Brutal Knights. Huzzah! Here's when I'm comedying:  Old York Tavern-930 PM-Sunday May 23rd. Located just south of King on Tecumseth Street.  The Loft-Monday, May 31-Opening for The Catheters and The Sour Keys. I'm excited about this one. Hopefully the crowd doesn't boo my shit right the hell off the stage.  Also, I guess I'm looking for part-time work again. So, send me your resume tips! And there's a job opening at Blue Meaney's. Get on top of it, slackers!

						    Cheap food is disgusting   Wassup, my peoples? I'm just killin' time at ye olde comp, wearing a condom and waiting to get hard. Actually, of late I've been toying with the idea of masturbating while wearing a condom. Has anybody tried this? Does it work?  I just found out that this gross food court I go to once every three months in Chinatown got shut down, for the reason of violating health standards. The reason this is funny is that it's an entire food court that got shut down--every restaurant in the food court was disgusting. If you live in Toronto and have no standards, then you know the one i'm talking about--it charges $2.99 for a five item gross buffet of Asia food. They found rats there, live cockroaches, mice droppings--essentially, if you have eaten there, the residue of vermin and feces has been on your food. And I've eaten there! Hurrah for me and my gross mouth.  Next thing I know, I'm gonna find out that those cheap Chinese buns are filled with shredded hemmerhoids and not shredded pork at all, and that my gross Vietnamese Subs I sometimes buy are actually just cysts found on old people and put upon buns. Discovery is such an overrated thing.    Moving on, the show at the Drake Hotel on monday went real good. I should play after video art more, because it seems to lower people's enjoyment standards so far as to make my comedy look like the second coming of Ben Franklin. Whatever that means. I'm gonna try and do more jokes at the drake more often. Audiences have been really cool lately.  Jer Finkelstein di some comedy too, and it went well, with a decently told joke with a punchline that was funny. That place is weird. I like it, but at the same time I am so annoyed by it. I like it because I want to be a yuppie. I am annoyed by it because everybody there seems to be on drugs I can't afford, be it delicious food and drink, or cocaine or delightfully expensive prescription meds. I do like the $2 photo booth though. My pal Clarrie made a poster for L'Afterparty, and my next entry will be that poster in JPEG form. And remember to go to my upcoming shows:   Thursday, July 1 : A short set at Rancho Relaxo during the 1000 songs evening. 'Tis also free. Then afterward I'll see if I can do something at the Poor Alex's Ryan Horwood-led comedy night.     Saturday July 3  Brutal Knights, the band I'm in, is playing with Modern Machines, Fucked Up and The Bayonettes at The Fuse room on College St and Lipincott, just east of bathurst. It'll be  $5 and probably start at 930 or 10. Please come.   THURSDAY JULY 8  This is the big one...  L'AFTERPARTY TUNES SPUN BY: DJ ILLARIOUS DJ ANOUSHEH  COMEDY DONE BY: NICK FLANAGAN MAKESI ARTHUR JARED SALES  KNOCK KNOCK WHO'S THERE!COMEDY  CAMEO APPEARANCES BY: ANDRE ETHIER AND CHRISTOPHER SANDES  PWYC   I'm sad that Olivia Chow lost the election in my area. I would have voted for her if I hadn't been too impatient to wait in the huge line.

						    Laughing on the Outside   I currently have a copy of "Laughing on the Outside", an unauthorised John Candy biography by Martin Knelman, sitting next to my computer.  It's for reading when waiting for this rickety macintizosh to "boot up", as they call it in the biz. The book is a fascinating read, although the unauthorisedness of it leads to many anecdotes of Candy slighting friends without details provided or even a rudimentary defense of his actions. Unfair to Candy. Also, I guess Knelman doesn't know the world's #1 rule-"if you are heavy and funny, you're allowed to be an asshole, because you will die young." I am so tired right now. Got some work to do this weekend, and then more and more shows, and yet less and less money. Basically, the point of this entry is to remind all readers that John Candy is funny. As Rumsfeld might say, mission accomplished.

						    Dale Earnheardt lost the race war   How come that was never a subject on Win Ben Stein's Money? I am bushed right now. My friends Allyson and Erin got in from America on monday, and I've been alternately working at stuff and lazing, as is my wont.  Did comedy opening for Burning last night and had a blast.  This upcoming tour with Neil Hamburger weighs heavily on my already fat mind; I need to somehow travel lots and have places to stay; so far the only place that I have no prospects in is Hoboken, NJ.  I'm really looking forward to joking for Americans. Their stupid malleability will allow me to control them via my JFK impressions.  It's a lovely day so I'm gonna get off the comp, but a quick recap of upcoming shows:  Thursday, June 24--An appearance at the Hot Box Cafe round 8. Then Rancho Relaxo around 930 or 10. First show is $5, second is PWYC.  Monday, June 28--Drake Hotel--Notes From The Underground-Doing Standup-$2. More details soon.  Sunday, June 27--Last night of the play I'm in at the Oasis, Short Plays of a Curious Nature. It's $5 and starts at 8. It should be fun.   July 3-Ania's on Queen St. W, next to suspect--Brutal Knights are playing with a few bands. Be dere.   Plus there will probably be a myriad of open mics as well, but you may want to skip those unless forced to attend, ie you are me.

						    Hamil"tons o fun"   I had a good time in Hamilton. Four drink tickets, some money, and a new style that is my new favourite: DJing with a mic in front of me and occasionally doing comedy. I want to do this once a week in Toronto. If anybody knows where I can I'd be very excited to be told. I think this is the newest, bestest idea ever.  There was nothing quite like playing a slowed down, screwed up version of 3 6 Mafia's Ridin Spinners before delving into my anti-gypsy routine.  Hurray Hamilton, and Hoorah for Hamilton booker Brodie.  Tonight I plan on being the matchmaker who hooks up Kanye West and Hilary Duff for a sped-up soul sample of a one night stand.

						    saturday is true hump day   I WISH! I rarely hump on saturdays, actually. It's supposed to be a day of recreation, and I consider sexualness to be work, so none of that, thank you. It's really more of a tuesday thing for me. Sadly, I went to get another $15 fifteen minute massage yesterday. At this stage I'd like to think it's a legitimate place of backrubbery, but doubts are beginning to cloud my mind. For instance, often during the massage, the masseuse's long hair would often drag against the length of my back, almost sensually.  That, to me, is a bit more erotic than your average doctor approved back fixin'.   I'm listening to Proof from D12's new solo album, and it rules pretty good. I am impressed, Mr.Proof. I'm doing comedy at the Casbah in Hamilton tonight, I THINK. Who really knows? I'm very non plussed at the moment. However, on the huge plus side, I have secured a tour with Neil Hamburger in early july, so I really couldn't be happier. Actually, now that I think of it, this week will rule!  Tuesday June 22nd:  I'm DJing! My friend Erin aka DJ Classic Bar Music is also sharing duties with me. It will ruleth.  It's at the Silver Dollar. Show up at 10 or something and get shitfaced. 5 Dolla, but let me know and I'll see what I can do about the 'jest list'.    Thursday June 24th  8 PM-Hot Box Cafe in Roach O Rama--MAD LAFFS DONE BY ME. $5. You are stoned.    10 PM-I'm at Rancho Relaxo opening up for The Bicycles and Fox The Boombox   I don't know what else I'm doing...more shows I guess. I am downcast, but only at this very moment, and presumably after the dogfuck that this Hamilton show will probably be.   Again, on the plus side, I'm going to the MMVA afterparty tomorrow, so perchance I'll blow a celeb.

						    Days of ice cream, guiltless fatness, and unlimited cum          So far this summer has been beautiful. I've been doing comedy sets if various lengths and amount of laughs, but it's been altogether fun.  My friend Jeremy's play Cocklength at the Drake was a huge blast of fun that was both hilarious and honest, but mostly hilarious. Then the Brutal Knights show was also fun and rocking. I threw water and beer onto the audience, and our smash hit Filthy U was weel received. The only problem is our guitarist's guitar exploded.  Dan Burke also capped his delightful turn in Cocklength by fighting the sound guy at the Silver Dollar because he wouldn't let Dan turn up the Ohio Players. I think that small anecdote rules. My friends from San Francisco are coming to town next week and I'm very excited.   Doing comedy tonight at the Poor Alex, tomorrow at Gorilla Monsoon's on Queen West at 9 30, then at the house party, then in Hamilton on saturday, and then on Monday at the Gladstone at 9 30, and then on tuesday at the Silver Dollar with Burning and DJing on the 22nd... and then like three times on the 24th...the friggin' laughs do not stop, even if they are wanted to be stopped.   Do I have any other funny stories to share? Oh, I don't know. Dan Burke ate lunch with me on tuesday, the day of Cocklength. He bought me a pulled pork sandwiches.  Eating sandwiches with a notoriously gross-faced, noble, lost and horrific booker is quite the time, let me just say. Thank you for letting me just say.  Keep on being my friends. Thanks!

						    MICHAEL MOORE IZ A STUPID   Once again, I give you an unrelated but eye-catching subject heading. I don't really think Michael Moore is a stupid. I think he is merely a fat.   So week two of "5 Short Plays of a Curious Nature" went down yesterday, and it was fine. Everybody was tired, and I was just happy I didn't forget any lines. I really enjoy this acting bullshit. It's like taking a vacation as a job, except the vacation is with excitable fools as fellow travelers. I'm being the theatre person high school never allowed me to be, and it's giving me a half bone.  I just sent in a bunch of CD reviews and am semi-satisfied with myself. Never a good way to be. The Brutal Knights show on saturday was true blast, in the literal sense of the word. A blast to the nose! A blast of bad smell from Planet Kensington, into the mouths and nostrils of all in attendance.  It actually did go pretty well, especially for a first show. People were having fun and the band played super-tight. My voice was a bit shot/shoddy, but my charisma of 18 won over the punx.   Thanks to the resourceful Steve Himmelfarb, I'm now set up to play a show on the 24th at Rancho Relaxo with The Bicycles and a bunch of other rad projects. It should be real fun, real real fun. Actual fun. Whoooo!  And also I'll be doing some comedy at the Drake on June 28th as part of some kind of art/video/music showcase event that costs two ballers to get in.  I'm out beyatches. Catch ya later!

						    "Blogkick" Me Jesus    Today I reek of B.O. It is a terrible thing. Last night I rehearsed musically and sort of lost my voice, which seems to be a trend for me when I practice music.  I wonder if my body sweats more to tell me my voice is lost? That would be weird.  I also have had like four people refer to me as 'eccentric' of late. Is this a compliment, a codename for gay, or both of those things? After losing my voice yesterday, I decided the right thing to do would be to lose some money as well. So I went and visited my friend Jaime and we went to a bar where there would supposedly be cheap drinks.  These drinks were once $3, but upon our arrival we realised the price had been upped to $4, and considering they weren't giving quarters as change, often a dollar was the de rigeur tip, meaning drinks were ultimately five dollars. Not toooooooooo pricey I suppose, but far from a bargain. That's the kind of stuff that makes me want to die and think that life is ultimately bullshit. I guess we all have buttons that suck when pushed! Mine are high price buttons!  I really should lay off the exclamation points. I'm thinking of writing a joke about how whenever I write emails to people whose first language isn't english, I tend to employ the use of more exclamation points. Why is that? The reason will inevitably wind up the punchline.  You may have noticed I've been  subtly leaning the wording of this entry so that I could easily segue into discussion of comedy and upcoming events I'm rocking. So let's begin.   First off, I think I'm gonna go to the Poor Alex tonight at 9 30 and try to get some comedy done. Not 100% sure of it yet, but if you're in the nabe, drop by.   Then on saturday it's the Brutal Knights, Bush League, Bayonettes show aqt Planet Kensington.  On sunday I think I'll do comedy at Einstein's, after I perform in this play that we're doing at the Oasis at 745. Come down if you'd like!It's $5.   Then on Monday, the 14th, I'll be doing more comedy at Oasis. I think the show is PWYC or free, and after my set there I'm gonna head to the fuse room on the north side of college near bathurst and do more comedy.   Then tuesday Brutal Knights play with Burning and Don Cash at the Silver Dollar.  All this advertising of my shit is tuckering me the fuck out. That's why I'm swearing so much. I do that when I'm tuckered  out. I love you all.

						    Saturday Night        Yeah, so I'm here and it's saturday night, and I didn't really leave the house. A strenuous practice has strained my vocal cords somewhat, and in true typical bullshit life fashion, I have a play to perform tomorrow. Either I'll need to scrounge up an understudy or I'll sound a lot like Kathleen Turner circa the part in V.I Warschowski where she hits the bottle again.  I watched saturday night live tonight and found two things funny. It was sad. Later on, there was a Norm Macdonald-era episode and I yukked majorly during his update.  My friend Steph is sleeping on a futon here by my computer. She's visiting Portland this week. What a lucky dame.        So this week was pretty good. Did comedy twice. Partied a myriad of times. And now on a saturday night, I decided the right thing to do would be to binge eat and then watch CSI with my friend.  I'd never seen CSI before and liked it, but afterward I was left with the ultimate feeling of having wasted my time on something that doesn't love me. Also, today David Caruso's face reminded me oddly of recently deceased Canadian press icon Brian "Brock" Linehan. It odded me out.  I've got a bunch of work to do this weekend and a ton of other stuff to do as well, and the shit is freaking me out. I lost a piece of paper that contained my detailed plans to become a celeb. It was all laid out. Now I have to resort to plan B: blow everybody.        Hey! It's checklist of my past week time!  1. Saw Mean Girls-check 2. Boner for one quarter of the cast-check 3. Movie worth price of admission-lack of check 4. Movie enjoyed by people who went to movie with me-check 4. Others' enjoyment of movie triggered inexplicable resentment on my part-check 5. Performed comedic impressions onstage-check 6. Impressions impressed- not check 7. Impressions tolerated-check 8. Told outdated jokes to lesbians-huge check 9. Impressed lesbians-uncheck 10. Milos Kundera-Czech 11. Circumsised units on dudes-not Czech 12. Listened to Kid Rock's album Devil Without a Cause twice-Check please! 13. Enjoyed album and felt justified in supporting Kid Rock--triple check!!!  I'm gonna go listen to Gene Simmons new solo album, Asshole.  The bio that I read says the album is a genre-buster, including 'neo psychedelia, beatlesesque pop, thrash, rap, and even power ballads'.  Yes, 'even power ballads'.

						    Three Hours 'til Magic Time    So I'm moving into the Drake in a few hours. I have two bags packed with clothes,three books, a few CDs, a TV Carnage DVD, and various clothings, among otherthings. I thought my check-in day was this past tuesday, but it turns out Tyler Clark Burke is taking her sweet-ass sweet time sweetly moving out ofher sweet pad, and so I was homeless for two days. A lie. I am at my parent's house and will be after the residency as well. It's really getting time toleave the nest. The umbilical cord attached to me is starting to reek and rot. Maybe I should just let it rot away naturally--meaning, not move out of my parents' house until they or I die. It would be a funny contest. No, but really, I do want to leave the family nest. I think I only want to when I'm absolutely prepared though, both mentally and walletly.  I guess this Drake residency will entail performing there various times, and end with an edition of L'Afterparty on Wednesday August 25th,with my performance filmed for some kind of DVD, and also Brutal Knights will play, and also there will be DJs, and also there will be other performers. If only I could afford to have Nelly do a one-time only comedy set. What a dream. Seriously, I need to pick who's gonna play it, and fast.  Anyway, I started this entry two days ago and am now only just finishing it. Without any further ado, more of my tour breakdown. Death Becomes Her is on the boob tube and I need to watch it, buddy.   Providence      We had bagels with Hollie in Boston and used the internet. It was awesome. Then we started driving again, listening to the new Neurosis album and critiquing various people we knew. The trip was short, but Providence was incredibly rainy that day, and mostly populated by Dunkin' Donuts, which seems to own most of the town's downtown area. Joey Mcintyre was performing at the Dunkin'Donuts Skating Rink that night, alongside Hanson and somebody else who probably has a weird slog of a life and is the toast of their hometown.   Muthafuckas be talkin' funny as flourescent talking shit in Boston and Rhode Island. Indian comedians probably do impressions of that type of accent as often as North American comedians use the 'funny indian' voice. You know what I mean. Providence was fairly miserable and drizzly, and we waited hours and hours before the club opened,attempting to eat fruit and veggies as much as possible that day, seeing as it seemed every night I was eating meat, and every morning also eating meat. The latter was often in the form of a sausage mcmuffin or sausage mcmuffinesque item.  The club we arrived at didn't even have posters up for the show, and this led to a wildly underattended event. Luckily, I managed to garner somelaughs from those present, and me and Marco managed to find a place to stayin short order after my set--with a girl named Colleen, who we accompanied to 'metal night', which apparently occurs right above 'eighties night' in Providence. We were mostly drunk, save for Marco, and when arriving at Colleen's we proceeded to party further, unfortunately waking her sleeping roomate,as well as her sleeping roomate's sleeping boyfriend, who was none too pleased to see a couple of amazing dudes totally prepped to make a cuckold out of him, which didn't occur because it wasn't a possibility. Then a bunch of other peoples showed; one girl and a bunch of dudes me and Marco now refer to as a band called "The Cockblocks", because that's what those guys seemed to be all about. We got wasted and fell asleep without brushing our teeths.  Waking up the next morning felt gross, and was compounded by the buying of brekwiches, the listening-to of the new Adam Sandler CD, and the drive back to New York City, which took forever, especially when we were actually in the city. Oy. Boo. Daaaam.

						    Eternal Bullshit of the Filthy and Bored Flanagan   So after a week of taking it slow, I guess I'm preparing again for another grind of a month. I've got to do tons of open mics, some rock shows, and play a bunch of shows at the Drake Hotel, where I'll be the artist in residence this coming month.  My project is to make a good live DVD of my show, and it's daunting. I feel like a magician whose job it is to trick the camera that I'm better than I really am. My parents have been away, and me and my sister Sarah have just been relaxing here, but of late I've been feeling kinda voidy. I need some centrifugal force in my life, and I need it fast. Does that make sense?  I guess it isn't particularly hilarious. Well, imagine that I'm writing this while dogsitting forty hound dogs and smoking a cigar, all the while wearing suspenders but no shirt. Now is it funny? I went to a masquerade ball last night and had a wonderful time hanging out with my friend Davida, a photographer lady who is funny, awkward and nice. I helped bring her photographing equipment to the club, and was paid off with free admission. Then I went to a birthday party for about 20 minutes, but had a pretty great time, due to the eating of cake and the drinking of milky alcholic beverages, which are a fave of mine.  Here are some show announcements:  Monday, July 26  I might do a set at Mack Lawrenz' video game-centric open mic at the Fuze Room, just east of bathurst. It's free. I'm probably going to have something else to do or laze out of this entirely, but I'd like to go.    Tuesday, July 27, Drake Hotel NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND 2 I'll be MCing this night of video art and music, with the rapscallions in Spitfires and Mayflowers performing to cap it all off. I think it's like $2 and starts at 8. The Drake is on Queen West, on the north side, just east of Beaconsfield.   Wednesday, July 28  If I get back from the D12 concert in time, I'm gonna go to Mike Sheer's open mic at the Hooch, on Queen street by Niagara and above Gypsy Co-Op. It is also free. Nothing quite like doing an open mic, is there?  Saturday, August 7, Drake Hotel I'll be emceeing(but not rapping) at this concert featuring Kat Burns, A Vertical Mosaic, mn-l, and  Teh New Sneaks. This is an internet-centric show put on by the 20hz messageboard, Toronto Chapter, and I'm definitely interested in seeing how it goes. I'm trying to think of internet messageboard humour that doesn't involve fixating on the mispelling of commonplace words. It's all about finding the next level.    Monday, August 9, Oasis  BRUTAL KNIGHTS are playing the Oasis, with a bunch of bands, including San Francisco's HIGHTOWER and Wisconsin's THE SHUTUPS. It'll probably be $5-$6. You should go.   And now, my continued serialised recap of my adventures on tour last week, based on copious notes taken at the time.  NY/BOSTON July 11-12  After a very late evening spent on Dara's roof, I had to write an article, which I accomplished via the wonder of the internet, which I still think is bullshit but helps me more than most dads help their sons. I was so happy to have finished this article that I jumped for joy. We(Marco, Dara and I) celebrated by going to a bar called 1849, which had two dollar beers and two fifty mix drinks, as well as fifteen cent wings and a band that covered songs from Zeppelin to U2. I got restless, because drinking gives me heartburn and wings give me the farts, so I stepped out into the street for a bit, and hung around outside famed laff grotto The Comedy Cellar for a bit. Then I ran into Gilbert Gottfried and we blew each other so hard, that by the end of our session we had somehow exchanged our voices. Then me and the team went back to 7B, because I'd forgotten a digital camera there late the night before. We returned to find it was not there. Someone had taken it. We grabbed a cab and went back to Dara's house, slightly drunker, and definitely more bitterer.  The night of bad tippery returned in that cab, because we gave a ten cent tip, and the cabbie said "Was there something wrong with the service?" For God's sake--NO! Don't be so insecure. Just accept the facts of typical bullshit life, you silly cabman.   The next day we got up early and headed to Boston, listening to Adam Sandler's new album on the way and occasionally laughing. I talked about girls who were hot, while Marco jonesed for the devil's nut hair, aka ganjah. We got to the club early, had an awesome meal at a nearby restaurant where they were watching an old Jam concert on TV, and played the show, which started weakly on my part but gathered legs as it went along. Doing a bad impression of JFK to a crowd in Boston has always been a dream of mine, and I lived that dream. The people at the bar were nice too. In fact, Hollie the soundgirl at TT the Bears, who was doing the door that night, let me and Marco crash at her house, which we appreciated very much. She stopped us from sleeping in our car and being mugged, raped and killed by people with stupid accents who hate America. Who else could I mean but Massasacheutians? We woke up the next morning, got bagels with her, visited the school where she once learned sound engineering, bought a disposable camera, and headed toward Providence on a rainy day, in a good mood. Hollie recommended we check out something called "Eighties Night" after our show. We needed to find a place to stay in Providence, so a lead on a place to find drunk and potentially hospitable youths was like discovering a geyser of stinky water in a dry-ass desert, but more arousing, but less exciting.  Here's a pic someone took of the Boston set.

						   I'm back, and I'm pissed on.  I sit here, just prior the dawn of midday, in my underwear and typing. That is to say--I'm back baby! My 9 day trip to and from New York three times was rad! I had NOW Magazine stuff and more comedy shit to keep me busy, so it wasn't a total vacation, but since I was on a tight budget that was often paying for two, I'm glad I had stuff to distract me with.  Anyway, here's a breakdown of my days, based on the copious notes I took...I think I'll break it up into sections. One day today, and more on other days...it's hard to write it all down.   Saturday, July 10:  Went to bed at 1, woke up at 530. Quickly packed all I thought I would need into my parents car, as they worriedly watched me flip out about whether I would get to NY in time to play the show. Counted my money and also stressed. Marco, my friend who so nicely volunteered when asked to drive my parents' car for the tour, arrived at 7 and we hit the road. The drive there was uneventful but pleasant--the most pleasant aspect being when we were passed through at the border, without any BS hassle or even a strong stinkeye. Young people are no longer America's enemy--people with beards are. Of course, during the whirlwind of the week preceding the show, I hadn't really composed my first show's set indepth, so I spent a good deal of the time in the car working that out. We arrived at the club pretty close to the show's start time, and I was too scared and unrelaxed to ask the guy at the bar for beer tickets.  Joe's Pub was pretty fancy-schmancey, and very dark. The peeps represented though, inlcuding Dara, whose house we stayed at while in NYC, and my friends Eunice and Dan, this rad dude Yaz, and Julie,  the editor of this  real good comedy e-zine called Two Drink Minimum (www.twodrinkmin.com), and this dude Johnny O,and even Adam Green, which surprised me and was radly pleasing. My set was shakey and confused, but I told the jokes I had, and some people laughed. The response was quiet but there were laughs.  Afterward, people at the show remembered me from the last time I opened up for Hamburger. We then took off and partied down at various bars, ending the night at this place 7B, where the people seemed to be picking the same terrible songs on the decent jukebox. Who picks Velvet Revolver EVER?!?!??!? Somebody, apparently. I had bought a disposable camera, but left it at 7B in a drunkenly sloshed haze of wastedness. Me, Dara, Marco and Eunice then went on the roof of her building and continued to drink inoxicating fluids. It was a nice first day. I was just happy we'd entered the country.   I also forgot to mention that this was the night of bad tippery--at Joe's Pub and at some place called Club B or something, Marco and Dara and others ordered food, and a minor tip or misunderstanding led to the server saying 'was there something wrong with the service?';at Club B it was especially bad, because we were legitimately trying to add to our shitty tip, but they didn't let us back into the restaurant, so the server came out and got in a verbal spar with Marco, ending with tthe server using hands as quotation marks and saying 'you guys are cool'.  Apparently servers there make three dollars an hour. I for one, don't even get paid by the hour, so he should be happy. Or at least happier.

						    The City That Never Sleeps With Me   OK, so I've been in New York for just over 24 hours now, and I'm having a good time, although I'm worried I'll run out of money long before this tour is set to end. I'm playing a show on wednesday but I also really want to go to Cinema Classics or Invite Them Up or whatever that cool comedy thing on wednesdays is here in 'da city'. I'll post my tour dates at the bottom of this lil blog entry as well.  I'm tired right now. I'm planning on eating wings soon though, so that will probably give me an energy that vegetarians only dream about. Do vegetarians dream at all? I've always wondered.   Anyway, last night's show went real cool. I was amazed at the amount of pals and people I'd invited who came--Julie, the editor of Two Drink Minimum(an itnernet comedy magazine, at www.twodrinkmin.com,  designed by a guy named Dan who was there too) showed up and was very cool. Adam Green showed as well, which was a really, really nice surprise. I interviewed him at the beginning of the year and got his email address from him at his show, so I invited him down to the show, and he actually came, and enjoyed it. That's cool shits, if you axe me. Check out www.admangreen.com for more info.   I really want to see both Dodgeball and Anchorman. Which should it be? Oh, by the way, do you know how scary it is knowing your parent's car is parked somewhere on an NY street, just waiting to be barfed or shitted on or smashed up by an anti-semite? I'm so scurred.    Oh, and how did the set go last night? Pretty good. I did like twenty minutes, and closed with an impression. The crowd liked it, and a lot of people remembered me from the Piano's show. It was very dark in there and I had no beer tickets. Besides that it was good.   The only bummer so far is that I lost a disposable camera and that I still have a hairy potbelly.

						    Prime Canadian Beef   Today, I've got nothing. Nothing but sunshine, as it is such a beautiful goldarn day outside of my house. Not that I plan on going outside of my house, but it's really nice to look out the window while you're surfing the internet and needlessly putting off sending emails, and seeing rays of light pleasantly warm the soft heads of children and the elderly.   Things have gone pretty decently since friday. The Brutal Knights show on saturday was really fun, and all the bands that played were great. The venue turned out to be pretty cool as well, although I'm not sure a place where the band playing can be heard for blocks around will necessarilly last, it is a thrill, even if the opportunity is fleeting.  We debuted our new song 'Worst City' that night. It's about London, Ontario. Here are the lyrics:   L-O-N-D-O-N O-N-T-A-R-I-O That is where you come if you're angry, dumb and horny that is where you're from  Chor:  Girls in London Ontario have more problems than math  Overenthusiastic, quick to cop a tude in hair have streaks of pink or blue unecessarily lewd  repeat chorus  They are all outsiders each one of them's 'alternative' the men are thirty  the girls are twenty all of them have herpes  repeat chorus    We won't be playing til late July or early august, because I'm going away, as is our bassist Daniella.  Saturday I stayed out late and partied down in somebody from London, Ontario's house. Shaminess ensued, but luckily, not on my end. Or in my end, if you know what I mean. This week I'll be doing comedy on wednesday, July 7 at the Hooch, but that'll just be a preparatory set at an open mic.  The big shindig will of course be L'Afterparty on July 8, an evening where all who have committed seem to have pulled out. OK, that's not true, but my drummer Andrew would rather go to see Dead Meadow in London Ontario than get free drinks and help make my show more of a show. So there will be no live backing band. Ladies, don't fuck him--he's selfish in bed and has a girlfriend. Anyway, even if it's all shoddy DJing from me and good DJing from Anousheh, you should come and see me off. It's a once in a lifetime sexperience. I'm gonna do a goddamn 30 minute command performance. Or will I?

						    Memphis Bleek Is...an ASSHOLE   Again, I'm just trying to draw you in with a reference to popular rap guy Memphis Bleek. I'm tired. Why are you assholes forcing me to blog? I wandered around tonight and gave flyers to a bunch of people in town. It was really fun, and made me feel sort of like a guy who runs for political office, running around, kissing babies and such. I miss my San Franciscan friends who left on monday. They're some of my best pals, and I rarely get to hang out with them. Yet when I do, we have nothing to say to each other. Hey, I know what would cheer me up--printing some Brutal Knights lyrics!    T.B.S.L(typical bullshit life)   It's so cold and you are high drunk on beers and at a party some dame you like approacheth thee you shit your pants and barf on she  chorus:  TBSL! In my dreams TBSL! When I try schemes TBSL! When have job  TBSL! Bullshit life  Renting movies with seven of your friends everybody wants to rent In Company Of Men It's already rented, what to do? all I know is everybody blames you it's more typical bullshit in your life that TBSL makes you cry  rpt chorus end  This song has a brother tune by my friend Erin Mcdermott(one of the aforementioned San Franciscans) and her band The Western Dark. Their song called TBSL also rules.  Perhaps one day we will make a split punk seven inch where we cover each other's songs that share the same name. A wondrous day that will be.  Brutal Knights are tomorrow at the fuze room.  My comedy set at L'Afterparty will be backed by an orchestra of sorts.
