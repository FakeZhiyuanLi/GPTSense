        i dont even know where to start but i feel like i just need to write in here today. sorry i still dont have my last day of school thing in here but ill put it in soon. to start off, i have a cold so i feel like crap. second of all i think i know too much information for my own good. third of all, i didnt get to return 2 of my phone calls and i really need to get ahold of those people.   i cant wait until highschool. then i can escape all of this. why does life have to suck so bad?   maureen and i were talking today at sonrise and we realized that maybe were put into the same situations for a reason...heres whats going on.   the two of us:  are the only ones not trying to get a transfer to sprague.  are the only ones in jazz etc.  are the only ones in our tent for riot camp this year. ;-) haha  and were back in the same small group, once again.   its really funny if you ask me.   maureen i need to talk to you. sorry i didnt call you back. i took a nap because i havent felt good today.   i really want school to start. thats all i want right now.     i guess ill talk to you all later..

       well the night before school was out i wrote this 6 page reflection on the year because i couldent sleep because i had so much thoughts and feelings about the last day. im gonna type it all in here so you can see it because i didnt really have access to the computer at the time.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  this year was the greatest year ever. so much stuff happened in what felt like a week! im up at about 12:00am writting this because i cant sleep and i feel like i need to. its the day (night) before the last day of school and i have so many thoughts about tomorrow. im happy that summers almost here. im sad that i have to leave my friends that are going to sprague. im anxious to see if i made jazz etc at south or not. im nervous because i dont want to leave a bad impression and being nervous has a hand in being sad because i feel like i cant leave all of my friends yet. why is it so hard to go? i really cant leave yet. ive wanted this for so long. i still can remember when i was in 5th grade and i wanted to badly to go to middle school. when i started going to judson i realized that i hated it. this is confusing. i just want to stay. ive just decided that i want to make an 8th grade memory book because i feel like i need to remember this year. that would be a great summer project for me. i'll know ill still be thinking about judson. i cant belive its time to go already.   as im sitting here, im thinking of all of the great things that have happened this year. fist of all, i finally got to be in musical theatre this year. it was one of the best experiences of my life to be in annie. that play was the best. after it all, i still think most of the people in my class as their characters because we made it seem that it was real. i'll never forget annie.   choir is definately my favorite class. i love everything about it. it feels like we all grew really close this year and so much that it feels like were a huge 80 person family! i was also in jazz choir this year too. ive decided that i really like jazz music now because of jazz choir. we went to pleasant hill jazz festival and got 3rd place. it was fun but kind of dissapointing at the same time because only 1st and 2nd moved on to the finals. but im still grateful to have gotten 3rd. that was the firt festiavl that i had been in that we have placed at, so it was a very specail day for me. concert choir was also greta this year. we went to best in the northwest and we placed 4th. it was teh ebst because it was the first time that one of ms andersons choirs had won. we also beat crossler! :-) i am going to be in concert choir next year at south and hopefully ill be in jazz etc. thats one of the reasons why im still up right now. choir is really important to me and ill never forget it.   last night was the 8th grade dance. it was one of the best times i have ever had. but it was also one of the most depressing times. it almost was like showing me a glimpse of the last day of school. happy but sad at the same time. it was so sad to see all my classmates and to think i wont see most of them for a long time. why does the school district do this to us? i dont understand how people can do this to us. its not fair. they can all go die for all i care. anyways i went to the dance with kaila, paul, daniel, ashley and bryant. paul paid like 200 dollars to rent a limo for us. hes so sweet. i had a great time with them. at the dance i got to slow dance with paul, daniel, jantsen and dan. haha dan. it was so fun. guys can be very nice sometimes. :-) i loved that dance and i wish it had never ended. everyone looked so good. they said that you dont need to dress that formal, but everyone did anyway and it was great. people that i had never seen dressed up really suprised me. like stacy, she looked BEAUTIFUL! she had a really pretty dress on and her make up looked really nice. everyone looked great and it felt almost like a family reunion. i tryed to forget the fact thta it was bascialy a farewell party. that part was the worst to think about. i seriously wish it had never ended.   some random things that happened this year were: i was in the act of kindness group. we did nice things for people and projects to help others out and at the end we had a dessert party and we got certificates. i accually enjoyed health class this year. it was a great group of people and mrs. norris was a great teacher. in p.e, i got 30 on the pacer. i was so proud thatg i pushed myself that hard. i like to accomplish things that i only can dream of doing. it feels great at the end. i got passing grades in math this year. now thats suprising!   today was field day and i just decided to sign yearbooks the entire time. my yearbook is getting pretty full. it was kind of sad to be signing yearbooks because it reminded me that we were leaving. and i mean, what do you say to people you have known your entire life that you have to leave? ive got most of the signatures i want but i dont think im done yet. tomorrows gonna be so much harder.   well its about 1:00am now and i probably need to wrap this up. but im definately gonna write tomorrow because i never want to forget it. its gonna be awesome. i still am having trouble letting go. i cant even imagine how much im going to miss everyone. ik love everyone so much and tomorrow, saying goodbye will be so sad. i hope i dont cry because it might happen. i cant do this.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   yeah....pretty long i know. but i felt like i needed to write it. ill write my last day one later.   i love you all and ill never forget you.   ~alyssa kelsy~

      wow...today was a blast!!!! ahhh!!! i loved it!!  first of all at like 11 or something my mom and i went to goodwill! hooray! i got a few things...  then my mom took me to bridgettes at like 3 and we hung out at her house for awhile then we walked to kaiser permanente to catch the bus to go downtown. we had no idea when it was coming so we walked down there and just waited. it eventually came but it went right past us! so we were trying to run after it but we couldent catch it. so then we just gave up and just tryed walking to chads house but then we saw the bus again and i just took off running. bridgette was like "youre not gonna make it so just stop!" but i kept running and i came up right next to it while it was stopped on a corner and he just went right across the street and then i was just like screw it but it stopped across the street so i ran across the street and came up to the bus and i said to the bus driver (while i was out of breath) "thank you so much! *breath* my friend is still coming." and so she came a minute later and we finally got to ride the bus. wow. that was an adventure.  we got to the mall and since bridgtte had $200 she totally went on a shopping spree. lol. i bought a shirt, a skirt, and a earings and necklace set. pretty groovy huh. i cant even remember all the stuff she bought but she spent it all...lol yeah. that ws fun.  then a couple hours later we walked down to the bite. it was funny on the way there we saw this really hot guy and we were staring at him and his dad saw us and he said to the guy "i think those girls were looking at you." it was funny. we were almost all the way down there and who do we run into? CHAD! i got to know him pretty well tonight. hes an awesome kid. we hung out with us the whole time. im glad i got to meet him. but anyways. we walked around for soo long. i saw alot of people i havent seen in forever! it was crazy! people that i accually cared about seeing were: nathan, brandon, katie, ashley, alicia...and other people. i cant remember right now because today has totally made me tired. yeah we had alot of fun...bridgette and chad are awesome.  ill talk to you later....                       aLySsA*

        wow...yesterday was really fun...      i woke up at about 6:00 and got there at like 7:00. it was annoying because sarah and i couldnent find anywhere to sit so we went on the first bus and these one guy sat with this other guy so we could have our own seat. we thought it would be really bad on the bus because we didnt have any friends that close but we ended up talking to some of the people sitting around us. they were pretty nice.      we finally got there like 3 hours later. it was so much fun. i had never been to an amusement pack before so it was really cool. my favoirte part was going on the green rollercoaster. i went on it 3 times (not in a row) without getting sick. they had really cool rides there but i didnt go on that many. it was really really hot so it made me tired. the food was so freaking expensive...i paid 6.74 or something for some chicken strips and fries. and like 2.72 for some sprite. i hate washington. tax is stupid. but yeah. that place was really fun..i just hope that its cooler next year.       on the bus ride home sarah and i talked to the people on the bus alot more. theyre really funny. we ended up playing mafia with them a couple times. it was reallly fun. i was the mafia twice in a row and the first time brenna was peeking because sarah saw her and as soon as i tryed killing the first person she blamed me right away. that little cheater. so yeah she didnt get everyone to vote me out for awhile hah. cause no one belived her. and then when they did get me i told everyone that i thought she was cheating and that sarah saw her look and she never denied it so she must have. then the second time when i was mafia again so was she. i didnt know that you could vote the other mafia out but she got everyone to get me out. grr...then she told me that she had to do it to be safe. no she didnt!! there was still two freaking people left that she could have gotten out. i think she was just mad that i told everyone that she was cheating...hah. oh well. i got my laughs.       we didnt get home until like 10:30 and then i spent the night at sarahs. yeah. fun.      talk to you later.      aLySsA*

       today was really fun.    &nbsp;  i woke up at about 12:15 and i didnt realize that i only had 45 minutes until pauls party. i had just gotten out of the shower and josh shows up at my house. he was supposed to call me sometime in the morning and he told me he felt bad for waking up at 9:30...hah.&nbsp; i felt bad. we were taking yesterday about not going but i decided i wanted to go so we were trying to find ways we could get there. so we called paul and everyone was freaking out because josh was over. whats the big deal? geeeez. josh is my friend. nothing more. anyways. paul said he was gonna pick us up. so they came and we headed off to the family fun center in wilsonville. the people there were: me, paul, josh, maritza and morgan.&nbsp;we had a fun time. i went on the rollercoaster simualter twice and felt sick. lately i havent been able to handle rides as easily. i have no clue why. but yeah. we rode on the go-carts and josh came in 1st and i came in 2nd and i dont remember the other places...but all that matters is that i wasnt last!! woo hoo! we also played laser tag. that was a blast. our team lost. it was sad. they had 120000 something and we had 90000. hah. yep. we played racing games alot too. i never was 1st but i never was last...so i cant complain. lol. yeah. then for a late lunch we went to izzys. it was very good. josh thought that i was copying him because we had alost the same thing. but thats just what i like. i guess we like the same foods. its not my fault. lol. then we headed back to pauls. paul was trying to hide some magazine from me. and whenever i talked loud about it he got mad. probably some dirty magazine. i never got to see what it was but he let josh. yeah. then we all went to walmart. it was pretty fun. we hung out for awhile. then&nbsp; everyone left except josh and i. we were looking at toys and stuff. it was funny. he was organizing some of the toys. lol. then he grabbed a lord of the rings action figure to buy. then we headed over to the fish and he bought be 5 goldfish, a tank that lights up, fish food and tank plant. it was so cool. the fish are awesome. yep. then we walked back to my house. and we sat there in my front yard and he was putting together his action figure. then he rode his bike home and i went in to fix up the fish stuff. yeah. i got it all set up and cleaned my room some more. (this is gonna take days guys...lol) anyways...yeah..now im home....im talking to jake, nathan and chris at the&nbsp;moment..    &nbsp;   ~the inspiring words of jake becker~

       haha...i stayed up the entire&nbsp; night talking to nathan. we talked for 8 hours straight.&nbsp;crazy...that guy is so much like me i cant even belive it...its so cool though. hes the best. something i thought was weird that we have in common is that we both cant sleep without a blanket no matter how hot it is. now that got me. because that is so random and i didnt think anyone else was that way.     &nbsp;  i also need to make a shout out to chris. because i told him i would write about him the next time i wrote in here. hes a pretty cool kid and hes very funny.    &nbsp;  i stayed in my pj's all day and i felt really lazy. i worked on cleaning my room some more though..im getting closer. after awhile i decided to lay down and like 2 minutes later josh came by and rang th doorbell and it scared me and i fell off my bed. then i got ready really fast and josh and i went on a walk around my neighborhood. then we came back here and we sat on the porch talking for like a half hour then sarah and bridgette came by and wanted me to come over. so josh and i went with them back to sarahs and then we all walked to walmart. i dont know what happened exactly but we ended up seperating and josh and i bought drinks and walked home at about 9:30. fun night.    &nbsp;  now im here...talking to nathan and chris again. fun stuff baby.    &nbsp;   talk to you later..

       today i had mixed feelings...    &nbsp;  i woke up at about 10 and my mom and i were supposed to go to the mall. it ended up being about 12:20 and shes like, "we'll leave at 12:30!" so i was all ready and exctied when george asks if we wanna go to walmart with him. so we were gonn a go and my mom asks him if he could stop by our house and look at our gutters because something was wrong. george took it the wrong way and thought she asked him to fix them and he got all defensive and was like, "its over 100 degrees and ive got the day off, im not gonna fix them today." and they got in a huge fight just because he heard wrong. it eventually turned into my mom packing up everything she had over there and bringing it home.     &nbsp;  i dont know if that means that they broke up, but i overheard her talking to someone on the phone and she said that she still wants to be with him but he treats her like she dosent exist. so yeah.     &nbsp;  i didnt get to go shopping...hah.    &nbsp;  but when i got home i was calling people and i eventually got ahold of maritza and now im here. we went to mervyns and got her a second choice of bed stuff. this ones really pretty. its purple and pink and looks all shiny and royal. reminds me of an indian princess bed. i love it. the first one she had was purple, blue and green squares. but we found out that morgan already has it...oh well. i like the new ones better anyway.    &nbsp;  well...tomorrow maritza and i are going to the outlets.    &nbsp;  ~ A l y s s a~

        well....    let me start with yesterday...(wednesday)     &nbsp;   wednesday-one of the worst days of my entire summer. ahh. it sucked so bad. i wont go into details but just trust me. the only fun things i got to do were go to maureens for like a half hour or so and then we walked to riot. riot was pretty fun last night. then after riot k-lo and i spent the night at c-lo's house. haha...c-lo, k-lo, a-lo....i love it. we stayed up untill like 4 and guess what..? i accually stayed up as long as everyone else this time. because you know how i am... anyways. the mountain dew helped.  alot.      &nbsp;   thursday(which would be today...)-we woke up at 9:30 to go swimming at her grandmas pool. ah. that was really early, but for some reason i got out of bed faster than i thought i would. we went there at like 10. it was really fun. there was these girls there that we thought kept staring at us. it was kinda weird. but yeah..for lunch her grandma made us some burgers and they were good. we went back to coris later on. they tryed to put together a slip and slide. i sprayed with the hose the whole time&nbsp;because i didnt wanna do it. it was pretty funny watching them..hah. it was so freaking hot today. it got up to like 98 i heard. i kept watching this online temperature thing and i kept updating everyone as it got hotter. ha. i thought it was funny because it wasnt supposed to be that hot today and all of a sudden its just too hot to even be outside. i cant imagine what tomorrows gonna be like. its supposed to be 102. ahh great. its probably gonna be more because they didnt know that it was gonna be that hot today so...hey you never know. oh yeah. i almost forgot about the  highlight of the night . yeah so cori asked her mom if she could bring home chinese food for dinner and she said yeah so were just all waiting and she comes home and was getting really frustrated because cori and erika didnt do their chores and they were fighting over who was supposed to do what so coris mom starts getting really mad that them so kelsey and i went into coris room to get out of it all and then all of a sudden we hear coris mom yelling really loud at cori..cussing and telling her shes gonna have a peanut butter sandwich instead of chinese for dinner. it was scary. i had never seen her mom  ever  get that mad. then cori comes back to her room and shes in there for maybe 2 seconds and her mom comes banging on the door. wow. it was loud and i thought she was gonna break the door down. and then she opens the door, points to kelsey and says, "you! go home!" points to me and says,"alyssa! go to kelseys and then your mom can pick you up from there!" so while were still a little frightened we packing up and her mom comes back with the big bag of chinese food. and she gives it to kelsey for the two of us to eat at her house. i felt so bad for cori. ahh. it was horrible. so kelsey and i walked to her house and ate chinese food. it was good, but it made me think of cori. my fortune cookie said that a guy with  blue eyes  will like me. and kelseys said she was gonna be very smart. hmm. then my mom was supposed to come at 7 but she was a half hour late but while we were waiting we watched degrassi and some other shows. yep. then i went to old navy while my mom stayed in the car. (i needed to get 2 pairs of flip flops) and so i go in and they have this  huge  rack of  white flip flops . i was like "yes!" then i was looking around for some  black  ones and i realized they didnt have that great of a selection anymore so i asked one of the people that worked there and they told me to talk to the person at the counter so i did and she said that i could get them but they will ship them to my house within 7-10 days so i was like alright i want my flip flops! so yeah i had to talk to this person&nbsp; on the phone and give her all my info and while im talking to he ri can see my mom waiting in the car outside with a really mad look on her face. then i also realized i was $2 short because maureen told me that the flip flops are always 2 for $5. the lady told me that sale was over weeks ago. lol oh well. so i ran out to the car. my moms getting pissed and i asked for $2 and she was like, "YOURE TAKING ALL MY MONEY!" so i just took it and walked away. ha. anyways. now i have my  white flip flops . yay. but yeah. so i have to spend the night here at georges again. oh well. i get to go shopping tomorrow. thats basicly the only reason why i have any desire to be here right now. lol.      i guess today was...    alright...i guess. :-D    yeah. well its probably a good idea if i leave now. so ill see you later!!!!!     &nbsp;   love ya!   &nbsp;   a lys sa  :- *

      today i woke up to paul calling me at 8:30 thismorning. we called maritza too but her phone lst the call. so yeah. i didnt set my clock right so i couldent get up to go to trinity. so i was like alright, ill got to morningstar....i kinda wanted to do that anyways. and then paul said he could give me a ride and i told him i could walk because its only 2 streets away but he insisted that i got a ride from him. right before we were gonna get off the phone his mom asks if i want to go out to breakfast with them before church. so i went and we ate at colletes. paul and i werent very hungry so we each just ordered a side of hashbrowns while his parents got these huge meals. lol. his mom invited me to go to the coast with them because all i was gonna do today was babysit georges grandaughter which i could easily get out of. so of course i said yes and we just decided to not go to church because then  we would have more time and we thought it might not be that great anyway because most of the people were still at highlife camp. so we went to my house so i could change and grab whatever i needed and then we headed off to the coast. it took awhile to get there but we ended up going to newport first. they dropped us off at the aquarium.  it was so fun! all the animals were really cute. i liked the sea otters the best. the sharks were kind of intresting too. we also had mocha frappachinos at the snakc bar to pass some time away because we had an hour to spare when we were done. then we decided to go in the gift shop. we bought one of those water wigglers (the water tube things with the glitter and shapes inside) and we bought friendship necklaces! theyre kinda nerdy but we thought they were funny. theyre glow in the dark turtles that are bright and glittery and say best(paul) and friends(me) on them. haha. then we thought it was time to go so we hung out bu a little dreek thing and we found the salamander things. they were so cute. i was holding them and i wanted to keep them. then we went inside to was our hands and waited for his parents. then we just drove some more and ended up in depoe bay where they used to live. they used to own a shop on this strip of shops in front of the ocean. so they knew alot of people it was kinda cool. we went to this one shop and they were friends of the people that worked there so his mom wanted us to buy stuff there. i got a moodring with dolphins on it and a ring that has my birthstone colored rhinestones all the way around it. its so cute. then we went to see if we could find the sea lions because his mom wanted to go in a shop really fast. we couldent find them but we saw some baby seagulls! they were cute! when we were walking back we found his mom. when she was in there she bought me this green stuffed animal bear with my name on it. she said that paul got one a long time ago so she thought that i should have one too. it was awesome. lol. then we went to lincoln city to hang out on the beach. it was fun but it was windy. we had ice cream at this place called ellenors. it was pretty good. then we went to  find somewhere to have dinner. we drove up and down lincoln city for a long time because we couldent decide. we ended up at lee's chinese/american food. it was really good. but everything was really spicy. they gave us so much food. wow. but it was very very good. we eventually left and headed back to pauls. paul, his mom and i gave their dog a walk and we hung out at pauls. i got home a little bit after that. i had a really fun day.  sorry. i know i like to go way too much into detail..but hey! i like to remember things!  i dont have any plans for tomorrow so im here if you wanna hang out.  ~alyssakelsypinter~

       why in the heck did this happen?   why did it have to be him?   he was such a nice kid   and everyone loved him.  austin, we'll miss you, we all   will.       The loss of innosence the loss of life    Joy now filled with grief, we ask ourselves why    No reason, no cause, no justification to be done    Things that have happened should never need to be spoken    The people who knew you remember the laughter that is now silent    With your name now comes a smile that can never be broken    As they remember the times that have been    They also mourn for the times that now can not be    Sorrow for the dreams that can not be lived    But with the consolation that they have been dreamted    And with the memories that can never be forgotten    We find hope in the furture as we remember the past      i thought that was a good poem to think about today.      i still cannot belive this...      why, why, why?      today was alright....but i had him on my mind the entire time. today was pretty hard for me. i tryed to hide it. but i still thought about what was going on. everyones mood was different today. more sad than normal. nothing seemed good.this is unbelivable...       * R.I.P Austin Hakes *

       last night i spent the night at my good friend coris house. we had a really fun time last night. kelsey and i watched a little bit of mulan haha.. yeah but kelsey brought over her xbox and we couldnt figure out how to set it up so the two of them walked to josh and jordans. (which they werent supposed to do..) and josh came over to help because jordan was in the shower but josh couldent do it.(the guys werent supposed to be over either...hahha) then later on jordan came and fixed it. jordan totally dominated at tony hawk pro skater 4. haha. no one could beat him. or even come close. but yeah...kelsey, cori, josh and i were sitting on the couch and kelsey was like "go over there and sit with erika on the chair." and that made me upset because they wanted the guys to sit with them and so i just got up and went in coris bedroom and watched t.v. for like an hour and they didnt come say anything to me until after the guys had left!!!! you mean, mean girls...but yeah. so we ended up sleeping in the livingroom. we were up talking for a long time before that though..      today my mom took cori, kelsey and i to the mall. (that never happens..wow) but yeah. it was okay. i got my 6th skirt for school now, a shirt from ae and some underwear. woo hoo. yep, yep, yep.      then we went back to coris and just hung out all day and stuff. it was fun.      then her mom took me back at like 7. and i dyed my hair dark brown. the more i look at it the more i like it. which it weird...because i dont think i really liked it at all when i first did it. but yeah. i hope i can get used to it.      now im here talking to jake, nathan and chris...
