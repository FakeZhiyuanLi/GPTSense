      I think by definition I would be called a worry wort, but this has gone beyond that lately. Now I think it would be called an anxiety disorder. This is my usual day's worry:  Do I pay enough attention to my daughter Do I pay TOO much attention to my daughter Is my daughter getting too fat? Is she getting enough to eat? Is she getting TOO much to eat? Is she getting enough sleep? Is she getting TOO much sleep? Is she still breathing? Better check. (this happens every time she takes a nap, about 20 times per hour long nap) Okay enough on her, here's the other ones:  When am I going to die? How's it going to feel? What if husband dies before me? What if my daughter dies before me? What if I die before them? What plans do I have in place if my husband dies?    Where will I go?    Will I be able to get work?    Will I WANT to work?    Who will help me take care of my daughter?   UHG. There's more.. and it goes in this big eternal circle over and over... I WANT TO STOP WORRYING

      We moved here not much less than 2 years ago, with no family, no friends... we basically started from scratch. Now suddenly, one by one my friends that I've managed to make are leaving. My best friend (baby's godmother) is moving to auckland next month, another friend is on an extended holiday (min. 6 months, as much as 2 years), ANOTHER one is going to Japan in november and moving to Christ Church beginning of next year, and now my friend that I just started getting really close to is moving to Taranaki in about 8 weeks. I only have 2 couples left now, and they barely have time for me... I know they care for me, us, but they have lives, and we dont fit in them often. This feels worse than when we first moved here, because I finally had a 'family' going, and now one by one they're leaving me. Not even one by one at this rate, they're all going at the same bloody time. Suddenly I'm left with nothing again, but how do you start over making new friends? Especially after you spent nearly 2 years building up the friendships you have, becoming close... hell, they were there when I found out I was pregnant, there almost immediately after my girl was born.

      Bloody hell, what is it with writers block? I've finally gotten the energy up to write my book again, and of course nothing will come out. I have no problem with my journal entries, I wonder what keeps me from writing my book? GRRR How can anyone sit on an idea for 10 years?!

         First I'll start off with happy news! Cecily rolled over from her back to her tummy. To non parents that means very little, but for us its a very big milestone! I'm so proud of her.. I even caught it on video! :) She's tried it again a few times now that she's figured it out, but to no avail. I'm in no hurry, next is crawling and we know where that leads!     Me, now... well I've been seeing a good counselor for a few weeks now. She's the kind that lets you rant on and on until you suddenly realize you solved the problem yourself! We've been working on my self-esteem, and I had a personal revelation. Almost an epiphany if you will!     I read once in a very good book that says, roughly: "Women are always re-inventing themselves. They start out as girls, then get their first period and become a woman, thus having to re-invent themselves. Later, they often become a mother and have to re-invent themselves again. Then comes menopause, and the process starts again."    The revelation? I suddenly realized the reason I'm so miserable lately is because I was trying to act as I used to, and got frustrated when I (obviously) couldn't do that. I need to, as the quote says, re-invent myself. I'm no longer just Amathaine; I'm Mommy. Once that clicked in my head, suddenly everything just seemed so much easier, better... I found my confidence again, and with it my happiness. Still working on the self-esteem for my appearance, but hey we can't have everything at once! Right now I'm feeling quite good about my "self"!

      I was talking to an American friend on messenger just now, and panicked! I dared to say we were reluctant to ever return, that I was feeling like an ex-patriot, and then froze dead. Even now I'm afraid to post this, but I'm daring it. After all, I'm still a citizen I have the right to free speech! Why am I afraid? Terrified that the FBI or someone will see this and I'll be in trouble?? Has it really gotten so bad in America that I'm convinced its dangerous to admit we don't like whats going on?  Well, fine then I'll bite the bullet. I'm disgusted with our government. There, see? Wasn't so hard, and you can bite my candy ass if you have a problem with it Bush. I love my country, but the government is fucked up now, and anyone that wants to argue with me can go right ahead. I'll post your comments and my replies!  After seeing this thing going on about the photos in Iraq... my heart turned to ice. I'm embarresed to tell people I'm American! We're insisting we're Canadian most times now. The NZ 60 minutes interviewed one of the accused that took the pictures. Excuses came up like "We have no training" or "we're under staffed" etc etc. pft. Yeah, I see their point. Of course you posed with those men in sexual, demeaning possitions... after all you had no training to tell you NOT to right? A common mistake of course. Never mind COMMON HUMAN DECENCY.  Bah, my daughters awake and my husbands home. I've had enough :P

      I have an offline journal, but I type faster than I write, and at least my typing can keep up with my brain. Besides, why not share all my stupid woes with the world, maybe someone else can see it and realize "Hey I'm not the only one!"  So, basic information in case anyone actually takes an interest (yeah right!). Amaten is my name, properly spelled... in english its Ama-thayne, or Amathaine. Ha! Do a google search (english name), everything I've ever done is there since I'm the only one with that name! I'm 24, bipolar2, a wife since 2001, a mother since Jan 17 2004 of a beautiful! girl. We're both american.. husband and i... but we live in New Zealand on a work to residency program (which is completed on August this year!! yay!)  So, what do I want to rant about today? Everything, but I'll stick to the basics since I have no idea when my little one will wake for attention. First, things are going quite well with my bipolar2 and PND (post natal depression, boy I'm just a pharmacists dream!). I'm on medication - two actually, one is to counteract the side effects of the other, good stuff eh?? - that finally seems to have done what it should, so depression and mania are a dream for now. Heheh, everything seems a dream with my memory span, damn meds! Sometimes I wonder how they come up with these damn combinations. Most times you have to have your liver or kidney checked in case they show signs of failing as a side effect... great one to have, while trying to combat depression. With these, I only have to worry about mania (smart one, doc! lets make the manic-depressive manic!), which is combated by the second one that causes depression, and both together cause rather severe short term memory loss. That in itself might be a blessing... after all, reruns are always new huh?  Ah she wakes.. perfect timing. Not that I'm complaining, its a wonderful way to spend a day!! She's such a wonderful little girl....

      Plus, I feel like I'm constantly taking care of two children... granted, one of them is old enough to wipe himself. Mostly. I have to beg him to shave, set an alarm for him every night (which he usually ignores) to wake him in the morning, pick up his clothes and 'toys' after him. Lately it seems I will have to start making him lunch for the next day because he can't even manage to remember to bring THAT. Just about the only thing I DON'T have to do is ask him to shower. I even recently pleaded   with him to spend his 'spending' on clothes because ALL of his work shirts are frayed at the elbows, his pants are too tight, ALL his socks have holes in them, and most of his underwear is missing. For gods sakes the man won't even make sure his only three dress jackets are clean, so thats one more thing I have to figure out time and money to do.... he even goes to work with a ruined $600 dress jacket that has a HUGE rip in the back. Mind you, he's already been given notice on his shody dressing. Like he cares. Oh, and I have to budget too, and constantly remind him "No you cant have that book today", though he often gets one anyway. Then he just smiles and says "but I saved $20 at the groceries" or something.... whats the point of saving money if you dont SAVE IT. Yeah I suck at spending lately too, I'm too nice with offers to friends (mostly because i'm so desperate to go out with adults I'd PAY someone to be my friend... and seems that I have). Fuck it. The baby needs to eat, and then I have to do the dishes, laundry, and bathroom (i better do it soon, even I'M afraid to sit on the toilet)

      While I was picking up the various clothes and odds-and-ends around the house, washing dishes and bottles, vacuuming, and catching up on the laundry, all during the precious half hour the little one sleeps, I realized something. My husband has a sweet life. He's a doll, really... he comes home and takes ovre for me with the baby after work, and usually does most of the care on the weekends, and while that sounds horrible it occured to me I should really stop feeling guilty. What do I do while he takes care of the baby? Everything else I didn't catch up on during the few minutes I don't have to watch her. The only reason I have time right now to type is because my back hurts too much to do any more chores for now and I'm fed up with them anyways.  I can't even nag at him to do the few chores I ask of him, because then he gets defensive when I sound like I'm "telling" him to do stuff. I have to put it in a nice manner, like "Would you please wash the shower for me SOMEtime this weekend?" Not "honey you haven't done the shower like you said you would five times over the past two weeks, get up and do it please". We don't want to upset his majesty. I don't dare ask him to do the dishes because it takes him five times as long, I don't bother to ask him to vaccumn because he misses everything and I have to go over it again anyways. He pitches in now and again on the chores, does a lousy job, then expects me to smile gratefully while I quietly go along behind him and redo it because half of it was missed. If I sound like a spoiled bitch thats fine, but I work just as hard as he does during the day, whether or not I feel sick (though I'm grateful for this weekend, when he took over completely... meaning, he watched the baby and washed a few dishes), and I still   manage to smile and go on to make dinner and then clean up a bit before my nightly bath and sleep. Is it asking so much on a weekend to say "Do this one thing"? I dont even ask for anything big, I keep it small for gods sakes... how much time, really, should a bloody shower stall take???? One weekend a shower stall, another the bath maybe, once in a while the dishes (biting my tongue all the while and preparing to finish the other 3-4'ths that didnt get done)

      Ah well, what can I say I'm lazy. Instead of internet stuff I've been playing SimCity4 and Temple of Elemental Evil..... of course, with my attention span I've already lost interest in both, so here I am again.  My little girl has started babbling... well, she's been 'talking' for months now, but she's taken it to the next level and beyond at the age of 5.5 months. lol Other parents keep telling me I'll wish she never started, but I haven't tired of it yet and I don't think I will. She lays in her cot or on the floor with her toys, talking away to herself; "babababadadadadamamamama" is the the gist of it! Oh yes, and she's discovered temper tantrums. I was under the   impression that they didn't throw those until they were like 2... now we get the shrieks and "bitch cries" every time I stop her from rolling over during a nappy change or take away a toy so I can put her arm thru a sleeve. Know what the clincher is? 5 month olds DON'T UNDERSTAND NO. I am beginning to suspect that they don't learn that concept until they're 5, when they will likely start saying it to you but ignoring it said to them. See, I catch on quick!  Not that anyone likely reads this, but I have a few tips that the Plunket Nurses won't tell you! 1: To keep your terror from rolling over during the inevitable nappy change, put a foot on either side of them. Its an akward possition, but no more so than trying to pin them down with 1 hand while dexterously removing the dirty nappy, wiping, and replacing a new one with the three fingers you have left available. 2: Keep sheets from being kicked off by pinning them down on either side of the cot mattress with nappy pins (you know, those silver things that you so bravely thought you were going to use on cloth nappies before you discovered disposables!) I also use Safe-T-Sleep.. an expensive investment but incredibly handy when they start to roll. 3: Super Saver tip: Keep the little tyke from kicking their blankets off in the stroller by tying a sheet or edges of the blanket off at the bottom and top. Okay, this looks a little gaudy but what I do is tuck a cell blanket   around her feet and sides, then tie a cot sheet around the bottom then across her lap. You'd be surprised how many "what a good idea!"'s I get. This is of course for those of you who can't afford or dont want to bother with stroller sleeper bags. 4: Something I just learned... nappy rash can be cleared up fast by just letting them lay without a nappy for a while. I got laughed at when I whinged about the fact she'll wet on the floor. Okay so I'm obsessive, I dont want wee on my carpet! I showed them! This'll work at least until they can crawl... put a cardboard box thats been completely flattened on the floor under them, with cloth nappies spread out for comfort and easy cleanup.

      Good thing its Sunday tomorrow, or I'd be screwed when the little one wakes. I can't sleep, so here I am! Hubby introduced me to gnucleus so I'm pissing off the corporate music morons and downloading, so far, about 40 mp3's and have about that many more queued up. I'm still in constant search for a song I adore and lost the tape of ages ago. Its a women's choir singing We All Come From The Goddess, its absolutely beautiful, but alas 6 versions later still not the one. Had lots of fun finding some fantastic pagan songs though! And discovering the dirty little secret I never knew... I actually like Incubus Succubus! Well, some of their songs anyways.  In other news, my baby just got her first tooth! Its such a tiny wee thing, but its driving her into a grumbling mess, poor girl. I'm determined to keep it clean, I'd hate for her to end up like mommy, without a single tooth lacking a filling. She also started waving, though I can't say its a hello or goodbye since she does it seemingly randomly so far.   Blah. I give up, I'll go lay in bed and read! I'm nearly done with Terry Pratchett's Thief of Time. One of his best Disc World novels so far, and I've read nearly all of them!

      Do you ever sit on the toilet first thing in the morning when a thought comes to your mind, one that seems amusing enough that you think "I really must write that down in my blog/diary/whatever". Of course by the time you finished your business, you end up getting distracted by the niggling things that always come up like eating breakfast and having coffee, feeding the baby, then oh yeah I was meant to take out the trash and.... poof its gone. So now the rest of the day is spent trying to remember that something that now seems terribly important and you're SURE it was a gem worthy of the history books. Of course when it finally drags itself back to the fore of your thoughts, almost invariably it turns out that gem wasn't really all that interesting and why the hell did I waste my day trying to remember it, surely there was more to it......  Well I had that kind of day, but this time I still can't remember what the hell I was thinking! Its already evening, so I'm guessing it won't come back!

      Dear Gods, I still can't believe I am who I am with parents like mine. A couple of weeks ago I had the confirmation that I didn't actually need that they're hicks.... first, my dad and I have a near argument that I promptly ended before I got annoyed (my dad is not the kind of person you can argue with, he simply raises his voice until you can't be heard); and I quote: "You have been lied to all of your life... cigerettes do NOT cause second hand smoke damage and very little damage to the smoker". Okay, that was bad enough. Then we go on web cam later that day and wow, guess what? A HUGE POSTER OF PRESIDENT W. BUSH.   Well color me surprised.  But the most peristant annoyance lately is their habit of vehemently correcting me every time I use a 'non american' term. Saying nappies is met with "they're called DIAPERS!"; saying Fortnight is met with a very annoyed "you sound so pretentious". You get the idea. *sighs*  I mean, those aren't all that bad in the long run, just a typical American stereotype made irritatingly live. But where did I get my openmindedness? ("I'm so glad I got you baptised" says mother. "I've saved your soul even if you have become a satanist".... pagan mother, PAY-GAN.) Never mind all my other traits that seem so far out of line with theirs... um, like thinking?

      Why do I let my family bother me so? Why do I even talk to them? Every time we speak I get depressed, but somehow I can't stop. Its like an addiction or something.  My mom asks me if we'd be willing to come out for a month on xmas if they could come up with the money. I admitted it would be nice but hubby couldn't get the time off so soon, how about the summer? All good and well, then they broach the topic of the smoking since they couldn't afford a hotel for us (when I say they I mean it, I'm always on the bloody speaker phone!). My entire family smokes. Well I say we could probably afford a hotel so don't worry... "What about smoking around her?" my sister asks. Of course I say we'd rather you not in the same room as her. "Don't bother coming then" she says. And my mom says we were just wondering how important that was to you... and the topic is dropped as though okay well I guess they're not visiting. And making me feel like I failed a test or something. Why should *I* feel guilty about not wanting them to smoke around my daughter for gods sakes??? But of course they don't believe second hand smoke hurts anyone... well I fucking do, but somehow I'm the bad guy for holding to my convictions. Am I not important enough to see that they can't put of smoking for a few hours in the same room as us?????????? And if its so non harmful to people to smoke then why the fuck can't they resist the urge to smoke long enough to visit the daughter they haven't seen in four years and the granddaughter they've NEVER seen in person?
