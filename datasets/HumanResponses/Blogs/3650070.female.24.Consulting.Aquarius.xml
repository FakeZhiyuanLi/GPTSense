      I'm friggin tired and I'm frustrated.    I feel like I am the only responsible adult in the office I share with 3 - 4 other people.  Not in the mood to expound on this as will get even more frustrated.  Saw  urlLink Bela Fleck & the Flecktones  at  urlLink The Rococo , an awesome band and my favorite venue.  It was awesome.  Afterwards, went out for a few drinks and heading to the naked lady juice bar .... Wednesday is not a good night to go see strippers.  They're bored and don't smile much.  Saw  urlLink Mystic River  last night.  Excellent movie.  Dark, a bit disturbing, but extremely thought provoking and I liked it a lot.    Sex is a good thing.  Currently on the playlist - The Ataris Currently reading -  urlLink Questioning Nearly Every Aspect of the Responses to Sept. 11   Most recent movie watched - Mystic River (highly reccommend if you haven't seen already)  Trish

      I am leaving early today.  A very good thing.    I love my job, but sometimes you need a break.    I had to leave with my daughter crying for mama and nana.  Kiddo didn't go to bed until 11pm, and I was leaving around 8am .... she didn't get much sleep.  Neither did I, but I'm used to it.  She gets to take lovely 2 hour naps.  If I tried to take a 2 hour nap on a Wednesday afternoon, I'd probably get fired.    I have decided that I  need   urlLink these  shoes.  I have no place to wear shoes such as these, nothing to wear them with.  But, I need them.  I cannot justify buying them.  Will sit and drool over them.   So anyway.  My job consists of listening to about 6 hours of telemarketing calls a day and providing sales feedback.  For some reason, I enjoy this.  However, I don't enjoy the level of stupidity of the sales reps or some of the customers.  Ignorance might be bliss for them, but if I hear one more person complain about having to speak to customer service reps that are in India, I might scream.  Is it completely impossible for people to respect other countries?  Wait, nevermind, I just remembered who our president is.   The guys that I work with are obsessed with basketball, and every day sit and talk about the Lakers/Pistons games.  I just recently figured out that the Pistons are the Detroit team.  Apparently they won last night and won the NBA title.  I guess there is no name for it, like the Superbowl or the World Series or the Stanley Cup ... or even the World Cup.  I really don't get basketball.  My husband doesn't get too much into it either, but we have some fun 1 on 1 games.  I usually win.  I can duck under him.  Sometimes it pays to be short.

      I thought I'd never submit to the temptation of blogging, but oh sweetness, here I am ...  I live a boring life.  Seriously.  I am married, have a 2 year old daughter.  I work 40 hours a week.  Doesn't seem too exciting, but it is my life and I love it very much.  Maybe I should say more.  I love music.  I am a huge movie buff.  I read voraciously.  Will post current favorites.    Currently on the playlist - O.A.R random Mp3 files. Currently reading -  Swimming to Antarctica  by Lynne Cox Movie most recently seen - Big Fish.   Trish

      I just realized that I haven't posted in almost a month.  Sorry.  I've been just going through the day to day, honestly.  Nothing interesting really happening at all.  Although ... my daughter pooped on the potty.  Once.  We really haven't been pushing the whole potty training thing that hard.  She's kind of non-committal about it, sometimes she wants to go on the potty, other times she's content to go in the diaper. We'll get it figured one of these days.
