      I dont like politics but I do have to say something regarding the Bush Administration. Now I know you could say alot about good ol' George dubya but I will not waste my time (or yours) talking about all the wonderful things Mr. Bush has done for the country (sense the sarcasm please).  The Bush administration has shifted their focus of the "Weapons of Mass Destruction" not on actually finding these WMDs , because they have failed miserably in finding them (if they ever existed at all) but now they are shifting to "intent." INTENT they want to justify the war in Iraq on the premise that Saddam Hussein "intended" to create and use WMD's...........how can anyone justify the deaths of thousands of people (regardless of who they are) by saying "well they intended to use weapons of mass destruction." And based on that flimsy logic they justified a war that has benefitted no one.   I do not argue that Saddam Hussein was a good person, he wasnt. He was a sick dictator with no respect for anyone, not even his own people. But removing him from his position was something that either the people of Iraq should have done or the United Nations. But because of this war the UN has been shown to be nothing but a powerless collection of nations too scared to stand up to a bully.  The war in Iraq has not helped the United states in any way. The reputation of americans around the world is in the gutter. America is the most hated nation in the world and yet Mr. Bush says things are great. The economy is in the toilet, our government's deficit is through the roof AGAIN and jobless rates are at the highest they've been since......well since the last Bush was in office. And all this in the name of what? in the name of INTENT ?? thats ridiculous. Its sick to think that all this "good" was done in the name of Intent.......The daily....damn it daily deaths of American soldiers who are supposed to securing a country in which "combat has ended" If combat has ended why are these boys still dying ? Not to mention the countless numbers of Iraqis who have died and its not like we in america would get the real numbers of casualties...american or otherwise.   It just frustrates me that we as a country have a Presidential administration that justifies all the horrors of war on Intent. It is the most pathetic attempt at back-pedaling that i have ever seen. The Bush administration tried to justify the war by saying that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and now that everyone knows that there never were any WMDs the administration is just trying to save face in front of the nation. I hope we arent stupid enough to fall for this crap come November.

      This place is so good, if you like traditional american breakfasts this is the place. IHOP is like cafeteria food compared to Cracker Barrell. Their Momma's pancake breakfast is awesome. Two eggs made to order, turkey sausage patties, and three pancakes and their 100% pure maple syrup.......Its sooo good, i wish i could eat it every day but if  i did im sure id have a heart attack by the time im 28....They have lots of other good stuff too, biscuits and gravy, grits made to order, and thats just their breakfast ! They have lots of stuff for dinner and lunch but I only eat breakfast there.....if you are looking for a good breakfast way better than IHOP then go to Cracker Barrell !! Its the best!

      I've spent the last 10 years working towards the future. Junior High was looking at High school, high school lookin at college, college lookin at law school. And now that Im here, im lookin at getting married and starting a family....but i wonder isnt there more to life than just workin your tail off in school so you can get a good job and make money ? I mean, im all for making money and all that but isnt there more to life ? And i know ppl will say oh yea there is more, you know helping your family, community, and having a good home life. But alot of that involves alot of other people. Not necessarily the individual. I think we should spend some time getting to know ourselves. Taking time out from our life plans outlined like blueprints of a house. Learn something you've always wanted to learn just for the fun of it. Something that might not help you in any way in terms of business or anything like that. Like learning to play the piano, or guitar, learn how to surf. Or beyond that get away from your life and do something completely different. Like work for a year as a paramedic, bartender, police officer; whatever interests you. And why are you doing this ? Not to further your career, i mean if that happens thats great but just for the experience of it. Just to learn how you deal with a new situation and new surroundings. 1 year is not that much time in anyone's life and you never know you may find something you truly enjoy. I would hate to wake up in 15 years and realize that I hate what Im doing for a living and just wishing i was doing something else. I would love to work a not so glamorous job and go surfing in my free time. Live a laid back lifestyle that was more about enjoying my short time here on earth rather than frantically trying to make as much money as possible and increase my responsibilities as fast as i can.    Im sure someone is reading this thinking  " well he just isnt concerned with his future. he just wants to have fun and not concern himself with reality. the importance of an education and the money that comes from working a good job (doctor, lawyer, engineer blah blah blah). when he gets older he will know better. "  but if i look at reality what i see is a country of people who work themselves crazy just to make ends meet in a lifestyle that they are struggling to live.  it seems like no matter how much money ppl make we spend just enough of it to stress out ourselves bald.  Even a millionaire somehow manages to worry about how much money he is spending. Maybe if I make alot of money and only spend it when i have to then i can relax and enjoy my life instead of working 10 hour days everyday from the time im 25 till im 65......now maybe this is the crack talking but i would rather live a slightly more modest lifestyle and not have to worry about money during my life rather than make a lot of money and still stress about whether or not ill be able to put my kids through college. maybe ill drive a honda instead of a n acura, or a toyota insted of a lexus.....just cause you CAN afford to buy something doesnt necessarily mean you should.....  I would love to learn how to play the piano, guitar, learn how to surf and all that, but sadly ill be too busy paying off the million dollar debt on my head for the next 10 years....wouldnt life be simpler if i was a surfing bartender ? i think so.......

      Well the title has changed again, I dont like being this indecisive but its not that big a deal. This is more to the point. And at least you know what its about. I felt like the Riddler with the enigma title......(Edward Nigma was the name of the Riddler; E.Nigma). I would still like to know who "me" is....

      I think beauty means different things to different peopele. Just because someone is physically attractive doesnt mean they are beautiful. Beauty comes from the inside out, its a combination of physical beauty and the beauty of a person's mind.  Hmmm.....seems a little cliche'd doesnt it ? Well thats what I think.....

      What would be better? If you found one person who thought you were the most beautiful thing in the world or if alot of people thought you were pretty good looking? Would it be enough for you that just one person thought you were unbelievably gorgeous? Or would it just be trite and meaningless? If many people thought you were attractive would that be better? Would you feel better about yourself?  How important is it that other people find you attractive? If there was only one, or there were a million, would it change you? Would you feel more beautiful if more people thought you were attractive?  I think it would be trite and meaningless, to have just one person think you were the most beautiful person in the world. We are too obsessed with ourselves, we dont feel good about ourselves unless everyone tells we are beautiful. We dont see the beauty in ourselves, we are blind to it, which is why we want people to tell us.  Would having one person look at you as the most beautiful person make you feel more attractive? Or would you feel more attractive if alot of people thought you were beautiful?  Would it be foolish to think that it would be enough for you to feel beautiful if you had a person who thought you were beautiful? Or would you desire for alot of other people to think you were beautiful? Would that make you feel more attractive?  Would it be enough for you that I thought you were beautiful??

      I live in a Pakistani/Muslim/American society…quite interesting as it may be, combining two cultures and practicing a powerful religion all together… I would say it is rather difficult to do, trying to live as an American, being true to my heritage, and staying the path that my God has set before me. The dilemma is more along the lines of the conflict of American and Pakistani society than anything to do with Islam. Although the “rules” that I have been taught seem to be a combination of religion and culture and the line is so blurred that I cannot tell the difference between what is and what is not culture and what is and what is not religion. Unfortunately at times it looks all the same to me.  Perhaps I am articulating thoughts that all people have, considering the whole world seems to be a mesh of difference societies and religions. But I think that Im not cut from the same mold as my peers. My close friends and loved ones don’t think like I do; not that any two people think exactly alike but I think so differently than my friends or anyone I know for that matter that it’s a little scary. The majority of Muslims that I talk to or know well do not think like I do. It is scary to me because I wonder why haven’t I bought into the system like everyone else ? Why cant I accept the shortcomings of our society and the difficulties of our Faith like everyone else? Why do I find so much to criticize? While my friends find it easy to follow the rules set by society that govern how they live, how they study, even how they love…I find fault with all of it…I am so frustrated by the binds that this society puts not only on myself but people around me that sometimes I wish I could run away from it all. Unfortunately I cannot do that. As easy as that sounds I would have to give up the things that are of paramount importance in my life. My family, my friends, my fiancée. It’s the love and compassion that these people give me that keeps me in this society. They are probably the only reason I deal with and put with the bullshit of this society and trust me there is a ton of bullshit in this society.  So here is my dilemma: I do not wish to give up my family friends and my love but sometimes the bullshit of this society lights a fire of fury inside me that at times cannot be contained. I do not know which one to choose, my loved ones or choosing to rebel against this society. I fear that if I choose to silence my frustrations and criticisms then those thoughts will fester inside and eventually cause such a mess that nothing will be able to clean it up. But if I cultivate these thoughts, then I worry that my heart and mind will tell me to move away from the things that hurt me. And the worst party is that my loved ones are eternally bound up in the very thing that gives me so much anger. They have issue with society but they seem to put their problems to rest of at the very least they silence their objections so that they can live and function in this society. I cannot silence these objections; I cannot put these problems to rest. These problems have ruined too many lives and I speak only of those lives that I have seen before my very eyes be destroyed because of this society and this society only. I have friends who live everyday in small hells because of this society’s ridiculous traditions and customs. I have friends who have lost hope that they will find love because this society would not allow them to be together; despite the fact that both of them are at appropriate ages and in good situations to be married. How can so many people live in such a society that forces the suppression of emotions to the point at which people literally become numb to their emotions?  What is more frustrating than anything else is the fact that most people who I talk to those to whom I express these doubts, frustrations, and fears…they dismiss them as the useless ramblings of a growing adult or as insanity that should simply not be acknowledged. They do not respect these thoughts as being legitimate, they simply say well that’s just the way things are; you have to accept them. They say, you cannot escape society because if you do you will have to turn your back on everything you know and everyone you love. Almost as if they are trying to force me to stay by scaring me. By threatening the loss of my loved ones they think that I will stop thinking this way and fall in line like the rest of the army ants. But no amount of threats will keep me from thinking…regardless of what those thoughts are nothing will keep me from thinking about the things that inspire, disturb, or enlighten me. As good as that sounds it is rather saddening because so many people respond to my thoughts and ideas in anger and disgust or with a lecture about how I am simply not religious enough. If I was a better Muslim then I wouldn’t have these issues. And that if I devote myself more to my faith then everything will be ok because once I envelope myself in something with complete blind faith so as to silence my questions then my soul will feel justified or somehow content with the horrible reality that is our society.

      Waiting for a response from a school is like waiting for your skin to fall off just to have to  it grow back and fall off again......what i mean is that its extremely frustrating and painful..painful only because the suspense is murderous.  Given that my mind is preoccupied with this, it might explain my train of thought.........  Why is it that for most of us we have our life plan from the time we are 10 ? my grade school education was pushed by my parents with the motto "make straight A's" Why ? because with good grades you get into a good college......now you gotta make good grades in college ....why ? cause good grades in college get you a good job or more likely admission into a good graduate school....now make good grades here too.....why ? so you get a good job......why a good job ? good job makes more money .....why more money ? because more money makes it easier to get married......  This is the plan that i have been taught and that i have been trying to follow since i was little.....i just have my doubts as to why this plan is the plan that i am supposed to follow or anyone else.....i mean for me i know that i have to be married before im 30, preferably when im like 25 or something.......and i have to have a good job....no mcdonalds jobs for me......not that i would want to.......but you get my point, lawyer, doctor, engineer, businessman......not exactly any options outside of that.....you know, no construction worker, police officer, teacher, or college professor.....no those jobs arent respectable enough, well they are respectable but they dont make enough money for people to give those jobs respect.....especially people from a desi culture (pakistani/indian) .... but even before all the career stuff how about finding yourself ? oh wait, ive talked about this before.....well my point is that i dont think this track is necessarily the one that everyone has to follow, or that i have to follow....  my uncle once said no one should get married before they are 35, now to be honest i dont agree with that idea but he had a point : most of us are not mature enough in our mid twenties to be married...myself included, granted ive wanted to get married since i was 11 and even more so after i was 21 but i am a great example of this point.....i dont think i was ready to get married....not because i didnt want to but because there was still alot of growing i had to do........but there is no way i can get around this problem so to speak....i still have to get married when my parents tell me to...if i want to maintain a good relationship with them.....thats the messed up part......its almost like a veiled threat, i have to do what they say, or they are gonna be so upset with me that my relationship with them will suffer......be it that i want to get married when they do not want me to, in which case they wont come to my wedding.....or if i dont want to get married when they tell me to they will make my life miserable by driving me nuts about it every chance they get....not only that, anyone who feels that they need to talk some sense into me will tell me about how i have to get married at some point and its a major part of life and blah blah blah.....  ***now im not saying i dont want to get married...i do, but i want to get married on my terms, on my schedule, not the schedule my parents lay out or that society lays out....i think im entitled to that...last time i checked i am an individual with my own mind....... im not a soulless robot that follows orders ***  yet it seems that lots of people want me to be just that.....just do what im told and not argue, do what im told and just have someone else decide for me what is better for my life.........and whats the worst thing about it all ? im too stuck in this hole to find a way out....at least not without messing up a lot things.......

      Yeah for real it sucks. I can tell ya for the last 2 to 3 years I have fought with the most difficult sleeping schedule. Sometimes i dont sleep for a day or two; other times i have this thing where i only sleep during the day time and at night time im awake all night. Its really frustrating cause like last night i was up till 5 am !! and i had class this morning....i came home and tried to sleep but only sat in my bed awake.  then i started watching tv....law and order.....nypd blue....those are two of the best shows...i love watching them, no matter what season it is...anyway back to not sleeping.....its really annoying because after a ton of hours i get this headache and it wont go away until i sleep......i used to think it was from stress that i wouldnt sleep but i dont think so....i think its the fact that my brain wont shut off......its always on...churning, thinking, working on some set of ideas or thoughts and try to reach different conclusions about things....although i rarely reach any conclusions that actually stick.  So since my mind is always working on something it helps me sleep less.....i just wish i could get some sleep at normal hours...and i havent even started talkin about my dreams..ill get to that later.

      my dearest friend, i wonder where you are right now......i wonder what you are doing...what is going on in your mind ? your soul ? its been a few years since you left and i still think about you....not all the time but certain things remind me of you....and i think about the times we spent together doing silly things....driving too fast....going to someone's house....eating lunch at a restaurant.....do you think about me ? do you see me ? i wonder if i am in your thoughts as much as you are in mine.....i still have so many things i want to talk to you about....things that were left unsaid....and thats my fault...i should have said it when i had the chance...but i was scared...and selfish....but now at this moment i wish i could have just one more conversation with you....to say the things ive always wanted to say...to ask the questions i ask myself everyday....i still wonder why it ended up the way it did....not that ill ever get answers....id give anything for just one more chance to see you....just to talk the way we used to.....i still feel selfish for some of the things i feel and think but i cant help the way i feel...i just want to know a few things thats all....just things that plague my mind, things that i do not understand....not in the other worldly sense like why did all this happen but things about you.......things about me....those type of things that i dont understand....sadly these things i fear i will never understand..and they will forever remain unanswered....you are gone from our lives...although you are always alive in my heart...and in the heart of others.....others who feel like i do....who wonder why things ended the way they did....how it couldve been different....had we wanted it to be....i dont remember how i was then....so many years ago...i dont think i am the same person now....i dont know if i am better now than i was then...i wonder what you would think of me ? would you be there for me now as you were so long ago ? when you came to school....to give some advice to a certain friend of mine..it still brings a smile to my face when i think about it...or how id always ask for a glass of milk when i came to your house...how your family treated me like one of their own....how i became a part of your family.....how i still am....i try to look after your sisters...they mean the world to me.....and sometimes im scared...scared that i might be too far away to help...too far away to be there like i promised myself i would...like an angel losing his wings....every step taken towards a new future a part of his wing falls...until his wings are gone and he is unable to help anyone....i wish i could send this to you....so you could read it...so you could write back to me...and tell me what you think.....i dont know what to do with all these thoughts now...its the first time much of this has been written down...and now do i publish it for the world to see ? or hide it away somewhere and never let anyone see it ? forgive me if i have made a mistake...but im only doing this to try to understand myself....i hope you understand....i miss you...... your friend always, atif

      It seems that contentment eludes so many people....no matter what we have, be it money, love, friends, cars, or whatever we always seem to be unhappy or somehow left wanting something else that we dont have....no matter what we have we always want that other thing......we spend our lives trying to accumulate things that we believe are important or things that we think will make us happy but it seems that the grass is always greener on the other side because most of the people i know are always talkin about how once they get this or that they will be happy....or how once they get to this point in their lives things will be ok....i am guilty of this particular example....i always think to myself that as soon as i get out of law school and get married then things will be great and ill be truly happy with my life.....but im not sure if that is how things will happen because it doesnt seem to happen that way for anyone.....the way i see it the people who are most happy are those people who take hold of the present and enjoy it for what it is....they try to find happiness right where they are instead of postponing their happiness till God knows when.....i hope that where ever i end up in life, from this present moment and the rest of my life that i am happy with what i have right then at that moment.....i dont want to be looking ahead for my happiness because i know that chances are that if i always look ahead for my happiness i will never be happy....

      So my website has got a new look to it...took me long enough....i have truly forgotten any html that i knew back so long ago....but it wasnt that hard, just hada use my brain....which is harder than it sounds.....in any case, the site is a bit different, feel free to tell me what you think...i like it this way.....the words will bring light to the darkness...  When i was in the 3rd grade my teacher Ms. Kemp decided to give everyone in the class a nickname, not to be called by or anything but just something that described who we were in one word or something like that...anyway, so she decided the word that best described me was "Thinker" .... i was thinking about it earlier today that even at such a young age, i showed these tendencies towards being caught up in deep thought.....i really think thinker is an appropriate nick name if you want to call it that......  I still cant sleep, its like 5 AM on a friday and im wide awake, im sitting here in my bed typing away on my laptop....its frustrating cause sometimes i just dont feel sleepy....and for some reason all the food in my fridge doesnt seem to taste as good anymore....seems like my food always tastes better when im at home in fort worth, tx......i dont know why that is....

      So the other night I was up really late, as usual, my sleep schedule has once again turned me into a nocturnal animal....anyway, i was watching TV when all of a sudden i felt kinda dizzy, the room wasnt spinning but i felt like everything was on a slant, i was walkin slanted too....and then i tried to go to sleep and when i closed my eyes i felt like i was spinning.....it was so frustrating cause i could not sleep and i just wanted this feeling to go away, i drank some water, but that didnt help at all........eventually i went to sleep...and then i got this thing with my foot, when i was home i dropped a billiard ball on my foot by accident and ever since then if i put too much pressure on my right foot there is this shooting pain right at the top of my foot and its killing me...dont know how to fix it though...  ive been feeling particularly lazy lately, especially since i came back from my trip back home.......i just dont feel like doing anything, definately not study..........all i really wanna do is sit around and watch tv, but there isnt anything all that good to watch on tv, except for the NBA playoffs.......and then i havent gone to the gym in forever, which is bad cause im getting out of shape, ill probably go in the next couple of days but im irritated with myself for not going..and then.....the weather here in lansing, michigan has been beautiful, great weather to go out driving with your windows down and the music turned wayyy up however lansing seems to have this cow manure smell going on, i dont know where its coming from but everywhere i go it smells like cow poo........why ?!?   i really dont like the new lenny kravitz video, i usually like his videos as well as his music but this new video isnt that great and the song is ok, its not great but its not bad either...the half naked girls in lingerie is great to look at but other than that there is nothing all that impressive about the video, i have to say im really disappointed in lenny......maybe he should get his dreads back, seemed like he was more creative with them than without em.........but his song does bring up a good point........where are we runnin ??

      The Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal is by far one the lowest moments in American history, right up there with Nixon. It is shameful that the most powerful country in the world has employed individuals to "protect our freedom" by degrading and humiliating others. I have respect for those soldiers who have given their lives and who continue to put their lives on the line to help this country however I must express my anger and disgust at the fact that these soldiers would do these horrible things to people who are defenseless.  The scary part of all this is the fact that we only know this much, there is much more going on over there that we dont know and most probably wont know but Im sure it is worse than the pictures we saw on 60 Minutes.  Was this part of their military training ? This gives the United States even more reason to be hated by anyone and everyone outside of our borders.  The most disgusting part was President Bush's praise of the job Donald Rumsfeld is doing.......Rumsfeld the man who spear-headed the proposal to the UN about the war in iraq, the man who is micromanaging the war for the President. In essence the man who is responsible for the disgusting acts of US soldiers, is doing a good job ? My ass he is doing a good job...the fact is that if those prisoners had been american and other american soldiers were doing those things to them, rumsfeld and every field general would be out on their butts right now looking for work. If those prisoners were Americans President Bush would have fired good ol' Donald on the spot. But America with our arrogance will just sit back and watch as the Bush Administration continues to put this country into a gigantic hole, economically and most importantly morally.    Donald Rumsfeld should resign his position as well as be tried in an international war crimes court for crimes against the people of Iraq. As should those soldiers in those pictures and their commanding officers.  They should be tried by an international court because you and I know that if they get tried here in the US not a damn thing will happen. Bush's approval of Rumsfelds work is another way of condoning the horrible things that are happening in Iraq. If Bush cared about getting re-elected he wouldve fired Rumsfeld....but ol' Dubya doesnt have to worry cause he will parade Osama Bin Laden around just like he did Saddam Hussein and you know when that is gonna happen ? Oh, lets see.....Id say maybe the last 2 weeks of october......it will be before November 5th, ill tell you that much......by election time Bin Laden will have been miracously captured and Bush will be some kinda sick stupid hero....  If it wasnt obvious before that Bush was ruining this country it has to be obvious now. I would like to see someone defend the actions of the Bush Administration or the soldiers in Iraq for their actions and Bush's subsequent reaction, specifically the support of Rumsfeld. I ask anyone reading this, if you can vote for God's sake dont vote for Bush !!!

      TRIPLE OVERTIME!!! Oh man what a game that was, the Nets won 127-120 over the Pistons, I cant believe it went triple overtime, wow wat a fun couple of days to be watching basketball playoffs.........I do have to say this was one of the ugliest games ive ever seen, terrible offense, too many fouls...like half of each team fouled out and the overtime was like watching a bunch of high schools kids through a ball off a brick wall cause these teams could not shoot, they scored 127 points in 3 overtimes, do you have any idea how many points the Mavs would score in 3 over times ? The Mavs score 127 in a single game, add on 15 mins of game time, thats another quarter so another 30-35 points ? The Eastern Conference needs a clinic on how to play offense..

      Well its been a while since ive written anything here, i guess since i was home and busy hanging with my family and friends i really didnt have time and i guess i didnt have anything meaningful to say.....sooooo now im gonna just put whatever comes into my head, rather than trying to put something that is interesting or deep.....not like im that deep to begin with.....so with that in mind, NBA Live 2004 is such a fun game, after spending a few hours (literally hours) updating the rosters to 98% accuracy, i started a dynasty with the Dallas Mavericks and my first order of business was to fix the interior of the Mavs. Anyone who knows sports knows the Mavs have serious issues at the interior.....Im trying to make a good trade but I dont know who to get, I know I want to get rid of Antoine Walker and Danny Fortson....Im hoping a trade will make the Mavs D alot better, especially in a zone defense, playing man will still be about the matchups, and defending big men like Tim Duncan or Shaq, ill use double teams......oh and to Naveed, have you turned up the difficulty yet on your NBA Live dynasty ? Yea, i didnt think so !  = ) just playin....oh and anyone thinking about buying Sega Espn Basketball...DONT (it sucks)  Now about the real NBA......WOW, what a couple of nights to be watching the playoffs, the Spurs-Lakers Game 5 was a classic with an amazing ending, I was screaming at the top of my lungs at the end....it was amazing.....I hope the Spurs beat the Lakers in Game 6 cause I dont like the Lakers......And then tonite the New Jersey Nets and the Detroit Pistons are playing in Double OT!! oh man what a game, Chauncey Billups hit a 37 foot jump shot as time expired in regulation to tie the game and send it to overtime....now neither team is playing well offensively but its exciting to watch an overtime game.....an overtime, extra innings, sudden death overtime, its just soo much excitement and fun to watch....now i must go back to watching basketball......

      bring me forward and put me at the edge.....i have lived this life as i chose to live it......with all my blessings and sins going hand in hand..aside from this i have nothing else.....no prize to my name.....no memory of anything...and now dark angel...take my life, and relieve the unending pain of this world....take from me all the hate, anger and sadness that has plagued me for so many years.....and my love, no matter how beautiful, was more a torment than a blessing ...fate had put it at my doorstep and i was always two steps behind.....never able to reach my love the way i was meant to..i was always too many miles away....take all this pain from me now....i do not want it anymore........take my desires, emotions, dreams and tears...take them all....what else is there ?   my angel, take me away from this place, that never sees peace or love......only evil......a place with only meaningless death and destruction....where the future seems as dark as the past with the children of this earth so depressed and tormented by the humanity around them..why should i continue in this horrible place....take me to a place where my soul may rest....rather than be bombarded by the hypocrisy and dogma of this earth.....where all those around me tell me to love and accept others as they are....all the while these people hate and destroy each other.....why should i listen to them any more ? they sit there with their holy books and prophecies, with their gospel and commandments, with their sunna and hadith... and they preach respect, peace and submission to God......yet they are arrogant people who keep nothing but hatred in their hearts for others and submit only to their own desires...  Why should i have to listen to these people ?!? their beliefs, pillars, and teachings have done nothing for this world except to divide humanity and help us destroy ourselves....We stand at the brink of destruction and still they point fingers at one another, blaming each other; no one willing to accept their part in what they have created...why should i stay here any longer ? i do not want more pain, more sadness, more anger in my heart; i just want peace...i want the constant torment of my mind to stop...i want the thoughts and nightmares to end so that my soul can rest.....i wish i had a true freedom where i could do the things i wanted, think the way i wanted, love the way i wanted.... but this world would not allow it.....my angel, take me away from this horrible place full of hate, darkness, and depression...take me away from here..take me away.....

           as i come to the brink of my nightmare, i see all that i ever wanted in this life start to slip away....as i look back at all my sins, i realize its too much...more than could ever be atoned for.....i stand before You, asking for forgiveness, i wonder if You would still grant it to me....i know i acted out of selfishness...somehow justifying it all to myself that it was right....that these sins were right......the shadow called sin follows me without a word...remorse and agony are repeated...until finally...i end up at despair....but sinners like me dont know...that if we turn around, there is a light...a light which keeps shining on us ever so warmly.....as i fight for redemption and as my darkness fights back i wonder if there are really only two ways in life..as i have always been taught there are only two ways......the right and wrong...the choice.....a choice between two things...the forked road every person brought into this world must face...a crossraod...whichever path they choose, they lose something...whichever path they choose they are unable to find happiness..but are there really only two paths to a forked road? No...there are infinite paths we should take...There is more than one path we should take...There is more than one path to the future....the future...it sounds so beautiful....so far away....i always thought that our future was in our hands and it could change if we wanted it to....now i wonder, as i am at the end of my road, if it could be changed at all....if there was anything i couldve done to change this.....why didnt i listen before ? why didnt i listen and try to change things....before it was  too late.......now i am here....before You....i am a man...full of sin...despite my attempts to makes things right....i didnt want to die this way....with more sin than i can atone fore....i didnt want to die this way....................  We are all raindrops falling from the sky, eventually landing on this planet and from the moment we set foot here we are drying up from the heat of the sun. Even if protected by a huge umbrella we never know what tomorrow may bring. Someday we will be blown by the wind and absorbed into the Earth.....  May God's protection be with you always................

      there are a so many songs that i could quote, that i could write  that you've heard that i could say explain how i feel about you but sometimes there are no words to describe an emotion........to describe how i feel about you......i wish i could let you inside my mind, inside my heart so that you could see with your eyes and feel with your heart how i feel for you..its so strange, many would say that i have an answer for everything..an explanation for everything.....that i can talk about anything i want to..even if i dont know what im talking about....ill fake it........but you....when i think about you....when i try to describe how i feel about you...i struggle to find words.....my thoughts all run together, the sentences dont even form in my mind...i dont even see words...i only feel my heart beating and as i see your face in my mind my heart beats a little faster...... i wish i could snap my fingers and make everything how it should be....how it ought to be.....so that you would be happy.....i wish i could change the things in this world....in our lives that keep us from being together...the things that keep true happiness beyond our grasp....i am no great person...i have no awesome power, influence or money.......and as i try to make something of myself, to reach a point at which i can promise you that i have the resources with which to support you...to support us....to create the life that we've dreamed of for so many years.......i wonder if i am capable of doing all that.....i wonder if i am even strong enough to do what i have to in order to achieve my goals......and the fear of failure shakes my mind and my soul........that what if im not good enough....what if im not strong enough......to create that life that ive been wanting for so long.......and then the questioning begins....and as i 2nd guess everything ive ever wanted i get so frustrated with myself and my emotions that i just want to scream out loud and get away from all of it...just to run away to some deserted place where i can be alone and not have to worry about any of this......i suppose that makes me selfish...more concerned about myself than about others.....more worried about not failing than about doing what i have to.........and then i wonder why im not stronger....why am i not more motivated to finish my work...and the hardest question to answer arises.......am i doing the right thing? is this the right path for me or is it a mistake ? i wish i could browse my future and see what would happen if i went left or right.....so i would know the right path to take......the thought that i might be taking the wrong turn scares me to death......i dont want to wake up in 30 years and realize that i hate my life......realize that my job sucks and i hate going to it........then what will i do ?  there are no easy answers to this and i know nothing will ease my stress.....sadly i must continue to walk this lonely road....i just hope that i dont have to walk it forever......my only light along this path is you....because i know as difficult as this is....as i near the end i can see you, waiting so patiently, with love in your heart and peace in your eyes......i see you and me....our life together....and i cant wait to get there......im just scared because i dont know if im strong enough to make it there.......A.L.S.

      what is our destiny ? where are we really meant to go ? if you could go back in time and make a decision differently would you ? would you take a chance at making your world a completely different one ? maybe take a different track...the one less traveled...a path that maybe you were too afraid to take back then but now you would welcome the chance......to have an experience that would change your life....change who you are...........would you want to go back and undo the regrets of your past ? say the right things at that moment.......go after something with more heart......find that long lost friend.........would you take a chance and change your whole world ? or would you cling to what you have because you know that its not much to begin with and risking it all for something unknown is frightening at best.............would you gamble everything you have ........now at this moment for one chance to go back and make things different......for better or worse you will only know once you make that decision......realize that if you decide to gamble it all everything you know will be different.....would you be willing to start over if you thought it would make things right in your heart ? even if the cost was so severe....so high that the thought itself is almost unbearable ? give yourself one more chance.....to change your life as you see fit.......but at a cost; that everything you have built up until now would be destroyed..........what would you do ?

      Well now ive discovered the headache that is image hosting......I tried applepics.com but as soon as i got my pictures uploaded into their server the site went down!!! that made me mad so i switched to photobucket.com and i hope it works...for those of you who dont know what image hosting is its a website that allows you to upload your pictures to their site....then you can put your pics on any other website that you own. Its used for online journals like this one, ebay, and other auction sites......This way you can put your pics up on websites.....The downside is that most places want you to pay money to use their image hosting sites....There are free ones but they are limited, they have limits on the size of your images, how much memory your pictures use and how much ppl view your images.....it really sucks but what can you do ?im not paying for image hosting....i know some people are using YahooPictures! to do image hosting, using the URL's from their images on yahoo linked to other websites but that only works for a little while.....yahoo has this policy that you cant use their Picture site for image hosting....I tried it first and it worked but after a few hits the image wouldnt show up ! I checked out yahoo's site and their terms of service, it says you cant do it ..... which sucks...its been a big headache but i think i got it taken care of...only downside to photobucket.com is that my images cant be bigger than 250KB......but i guess ill have to live with that......

      i am the part of your soul you would rather not see...the part that speaks to your mind with the kind of brutal honesty that you would rather not hear...i am that which you would like to deny......the very thing from which you wish you could hide....but you cant...i will take all that you have built and destroy it.....i am the darkness that lies within you...i am the part of your humanity that scares you because you realize what you are truly capable of....nothing brings me peace......nothing satisfies me....i never rest nor sleep......i exist inside you and cannot be destroyed...the darkness inside you which creates the thoughts you wish you would not have...can you see me ? do you know me ? have you felt my power ? i know your fears, your doubts and i use them against you...powerless as you are; you will try to stop me...weak as you are; you will try to fight me.....i am darkness....i am evil.

      So i bought a digital camera a few weeks ago and so ive been taking a whole lotta pics over the last few weeks....i was in memphis for my fiance's brother's high school graduation and i was in fort worth for my friend sana's graduation party....well i drove from lansing to memphis and then to fort worth and then back to lansing....so i had alot of oppurtunities to take pictures.....if you want to see some them go to the link that says Atif's Picture Page that is over on the right side of this page....i took some pictures of the sky while i was driving as well as some of the landscape and this one really good picture of the sun setting.......my last night in fort worth there was a really bad storm and lots of lightning.....so i took my new camera out onto my balcony and started taking some pictures....i didnt know how exactly to take the best pics of lightning....cause it comes so fast and there is no way i can react fast enough or anticipate where it will strike....so i selected this one option which continuously takes pictures as long as the shutter button is pressed....so i did that and i got a few really good pictures of lightning, which is awesome...cause i love to watch lightning......  irfan (my fiance's brother) told me about some movie about this fast food place called White Castle.......now ive never heard of white castle and as chance would have it as i was driving through kentucky and indiana i stopped for some food at wendy's and what do you know there is a white castle right next door !! so i took a picture of it....i figure, who knows when ill see another one ? go to my picture page if you are actually interested in seeing a pic of this place.....its just a funny name, white castle......for those of you who are actually wondering (im sure none of you are) i tried the burger king spicy chicken sandwich, it was really big but it wasnt that good, i still give wendy's the best spicy chicken....i could go for one of those right now........im hungry

      Again ? Yea i changed the site again.. not because i didnt like the way it was before but just because i wanted to see what it looked like if it was like this...i like it this way....seems more elegant...if that means anything...  the director of the CIA George Tenet resigned his position a day or two ago for personal reasons....now this is not all that surprising or newsworthy but yesterday James Pavitt the deputy director of the CIA resigned and a CNN.com article(  http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/04/tenet.resigns/index.html  ) states that Pavitt planned to resign a month ago...which of course is very convienent for the CIA and of course the political agendas of these two men...I am wondering, what happened at Langley, Virginia or in DC that is so horrible that the two men who run the Central Intelligence Agency have suddenly resigned within 24 hours of one another ? It strikes me as odd that these two men would resign in such close proximity...it makes me think that something really bad as happend or is about to happen and they are getting out before the crap storm hits......they want to get out before anyone can lay blame on them for the failures in intelligence gathering prior to 9-11 and the poor intelligence used to justify the war in Iraq....of course some one must be responsible.....maybe these two guys were going to be the scape goats....I dont know what really happened or why they resigned, i doubt we will ever know the truth but realize that this is no coincidence, this is th e result of a catastrophic shake up in the political roster of Washington DC that will claim more people's jobs and hopefully bring in a new President.

      I have so much pain inside me that i want to release. But no matter how hard i try to release it, i cant do it. I want to drown in a flood of my own tears that just dont flow. I know better than anyone else that the things that hurt me, the things that have hurt me in my life pale in comparison to what some have gone through. I know that in the grand scheme of things my pain doesnt really mean much because they are things that I should get over. They are things that I should be able to get past but i cant. These things torment me and disturb my every waking moment. And even in my sleep, as rare as it is, these things torture me. I do not see logic, reason or the silver lining behind all of this. I see only pain. I know its petty, i know its not as bad as i make it seem. But i cant help how i feel.  I would love to be able to say that I am happy with the way my life is and that i find some contentment in the things around me. But i find nothing like that, i find only regret and sorrow, anger and sadness, the wish to go back to do it over again.

      Ricky Williams, at age 27, retired from the National Football League over the weekend. Now before you stop reading cause you think im writing about sports, just read a little more. Ricky Williams has never been a conventional NFL star, he wore a wedding dress on the cover of a magazine with Mike Ditka. He is just a little different. Williams has great stats and has a great contract with the Miami Dolphins which would keep him well paid for a long time. So why retire at such a young age ? Why give up the fame and fortune ? Why do something that everyone else says is stupid and waste of talent ?   Because Ricky Williams is human. He wants to spend his time doing things that he enjoys and loves. If he doesnt enjoy playing football, no matter how much it pays him, then he shouldnt play. Its that simple. Its not some complicated difficult decision. Do you want to play ? Yes or no. If yes, then play hard. If no, then go do what you want to do. It is rumored Williams never liked the demands playing in the NFL put on him nor the restrictions on his personal lifestyle. Williams is an admitted pot smoker who has been fined by the NFL for testing positive for marijuana. Last december he tested positive again and was set to incur more fines in the coming months. But Williams made his decision, shaved his head clean of his dreadlocks and boarded a plane for Asia. Williams loves to travel and thats what he is doing.  Now there have been plenty of sports buffs saying that this is a terrible waste, a great young talent who was the heart of his football team. Williams was the most important piece of the Miami Dolphins. And there will be plenty of people, sports fans or not, who will say "Williams is stupid for leaving all that money." or "He cant do anything else, he is best suited for playing football." But the fact remains that he doesnt want to play anymore. Whatever the consequences are of that: living a less lavish lifestyle or not being on TV every sunday from fall to spring; he doesnt feel the desire to play.   I for one admire Ricky Williams for his strength. It takes alot of courage to do what he did. Now I dont agree with the timing of his decision, he really did put his team in a bind because now they are totally screwed. They dont have a decent running back nor do they have time to find one. Had Williams given them some warning maybe the Dolphins wouldnt be so mad bout this. But like i was saying, i applaud Williams' courage to do what everyone else said was a bad idea, or stupid, or a waste. He made a decision and stuck with it. He wasnt going to be talked out of it. Regardless of what any of his friends or family thought or said he made his decision. Now some would say it was selfish of him make a decision despite his loved ones' protest. But how does that make him selfish ? He is entitled to make his decisions and not everyone is going to agree with them. If his mom or dad, brother or sister, friend or girlfriend thought it was a bad idea and Ricky did it anyway therefore he is selfish  ? It doesnt make any sense to me.    Ricky Williams retirement from the NFL is a perfect example of a person doing what they thought would make them happy. Now whether or not Williams stays out of the NFL remains to be seen and if he is truly happy one can never tell. But like i said in an earlier entry happiness only exists in the present. You cant tell yourself that once I get to this point in my life then i'll be happy. You must find happiness in your everyday life and if you cant, then get some place where you can find everyday happiness and peace. Williams was able to escape from a life that was not making him happy. The millions of dollars, fame and Sportscenter highlights were not things that kept Williams happy. Now maybe for some of us this would keep us happy. Everyone is not going to understand his decision but everyone isnt supposed to. It was Williams decision to make and live with.   I think we all try to live our lives with the idea that we want to be happy. But we perceive expectations from those around us of what type of job we should have or how much money we should make in a year. The fact is that those things are irrelevant if you arent at peace with yourself in your heart. I look at the rich and many of them are drowning in anti-depressants despite their endless money. Prozac, Xanax, and Flintstones Chewable Morphine are all just ways of chemically inducing peace of mind.  Im hoping to find peace of mind without them. I would trade all the money and fame in the world if i could guarantee my peace of mind. I hope I can be strong enough to do what I want without worrying about what others' expectations are of me.   Congratulations Ricky on escaping from a life of meeting others' expectations.  Hook 'em !!

        *Disclaimer*    If you are sensitive about your religious beliefs or are easily offended by strong religious philosophy then I suggest you not read this post.      I really found all the comments of my previous Religion entry so thought provoking that I decided to respond to them here as opposed to the comment form. And i threw in some more of my thoughts on religion.  Once aliens come to Earth I really believe there will be a wide-spread social upheaval in which many people will turn to religion and at the same time there will be many people who turn away from religion. The fact is that no religion talks about aliens and those people who expect their faith to explain what aliens are will find nothing. Islam talks about Jinn, which are essentially spirits, and their description seems to be similar to aliens. But if a UFO lands on earth and out pops ET, i dont think any one can say that their religion predicted this or has any explanation.    The idea that our lives are pre-destined is a very troublesome one that makes me wonder what is the true purpose of religion. The idea that God already knows what we are going to do makes it seems as if we have no control over our selves and that there is no such thing as choice. If God already knows then did he already make the choice for us ? If we havent made the choice then how can He know ? Has he programmed us so well that he already knows what we will do in a given situation ? If so, then my choices have already been made for me. If in fact my choices have already been made for me then why should I be held responsible for the bad things that i do ? Or why should i gain benefit from the good things i do ? Now if we do have choice then is God relevant ? I believe so. In my opinion there is a Grand Creator of this universe and the creator is God. And as such he deserves our credit and gratitude for having given us life and created this world for us.  I know its a simple answer to a complex question that in know way solves this problem....and to be honest I really had to stop and think about whether or not God is relevant in this situation. Im still not sure.  I really do find this idea of good/bad deeds to be rather primitive. Its just so greedy, thats the best way i can put it. People are driven to do good deeds because they think that it will get them access to heaven ? That just makes the good action useless in my eyes. Im not going to help an old woman cross the street because I think im helping the "Send Atif to Heaven Fund" im helping her because she needs a little help getting across the street. And in my religion in particular there is this thought that a believer must out weigh his/her sins in order to reach heaven. So if you do a certain action and say this verse a certain number of times your "reward" is multiplied by X. Who is keeping track of all this ? Is there someone out there keeping count of all their sins and all their "reward" ? Some kinda Soul Accountant who is gonna show God all the great stuff you did so now you get to go to heaven....Im not talkin about the angels on your right and left shoulder, im talking about a person, an individual, who is going to keep track during their lives ? So when they die they can look at their "Soul Account" and see where they expect to be going ........What if once we die God shows up and says "I just made all that stuff up, its meaningless.." What IF that happens ?  In my more cynical moments id say that religion is nothing more than control. It was designed to control people with the fear of something greater than man, greater than Earth. Something so powerful, so frightening that everyone would do as they are told in order to avoid the eternal punishment. The Day of Judgement is just a way to make us feel guilty for the bad things we've done that no one knows about. Judgement is just a way to control humanity. I have my doubts as to what the afterlife holds for us if anything at all. I wonder if there will really be a judgement or if when we die there will be nothing but silence; nothing but darkness. I ask again, why would God create us and give us life, free will, and intelligence, only to test and judge us ? Karl Marx was right when he said "Religion is the opium of the masses." Religion serves to give us explanations for things that we cannot explain. The fact remains that all the religious books and texts that document the history of different religions were written by man. There is no original text of God's message therefore I am extremely skeptical as to the validity of any book(s). I want to see a 1000 year old version of the Quran. I want to see the orginal version of the Bible, not the King James version.  I want to see the Arc of the Covenant be discovered and when two stone tablets with the Ten Commandments come out of it then maybe I'll change my thinking.  Everyone will agree that being a good person is a very important thing for a human being. However, I am still stuck inside the trivial customs and rituals of my religion. For example, my religion says im not supposed to eat any meat from a pig. Now I have no idea how eating a pig affects me being a good person but I have been brainwashed so well that I still cant eat anything with pig in it. No sausage, ham, pork chops...nothing...I just cant do it. I do find these little things that i worry about trivial in the grand scheme of things.  If indeed the purpose of religion is to teach us how to live as good people then why does every religion have so many of these little rules and regulations ? I cant get a tatoo, wear gold, or eat pork. Now how does any of that affect whether or not I am a good person ?   I do not find anything wrong with practicing any religion. Any person practicing any religion for the purpose of trying to live as a good person; that person is a believer. I still think we are all headed to the same point from different paths. It is the exclusivist way of thinking, the I AM RIGHT and everyone else isnt, that I am vehemently opposed to. Heaven or hell, no one KNOWS if these places exist. So why are so many living for the next life ? All Im saying is that everyone KNOWS their life here is short. Everyone KNOWS hate breeds hate. So spend your short time here spreading peace and love instead of hate because you will only be remembered by what you brought into the world.  Im not living on this earth so that i can reach some higher plain of existence in a next life at the expense of my life here on earth....I am trying to live as a good person in this world b/c i think it will bring me happiness during my life here...and that is the most important part of "religion" ....... living well. And its alot harder than these words make it seem.

      Lets talk about sports.  NBA - Shaq got traded to the Heat.....for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, Brian Grant, and a 1st round pick.....ummmmm....ummm.....WHAT?!? This is by far one of the worst trades in NBA history.....The Lakers are so scared of playing Shaq that they would rather send Shaq to the East rather than get any good players for him....Hey Dr. Buss, have fun with Kobe cause ya'll are gonna be picking #8 in the draft next season....in any case, this all sucks for the Dallas Mavericks who successfully made no decent moves this off season....they sent Antawn Jamison to Washington for crap, Stackhouse, Laettner, and whatever else.....and then they managed not to get Shaq....great job there Cuban....oh and we lost our starting point guard and got nothing for him....Now Steve Nash has alot of mileage on him but we still needed him....and Derek Fisher was available and we managed to not get him too....and rumor has it that Dampier is headed to the Knicks...soooo the Mavs have done NOTHING to help themselves while the Spurs and Rockets got better...So the Mavs are gonna be nowhere near an NBA championship....  NFL - Eddie George is asking to be released from the Titans.....Cowboys need a running back, Jones & Parcells please go after Eddie, you could split his carries with Julius Jones and have a great locker room presence......  MLB - Rangers are doing well, which is wonderful especially since we managed to get rid of the $250 million man and the team is on top of the baseball world, well next to the Yankees.....and did anyone see the eruption of Carlos Zombrano at the Cardinals-Cubs game the other night ? He hit Edmonds twice in one game, the hell was his problem....and speaking of eruptions David Ortiz of the cursed BoSox threw 2 baseball bats at umpires.....ya, suspension ? like 10 games at least....  Ok those are my sports thoughts for the day........

      "In the world I see - you are stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life. You'll climb the wrist-thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn, laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of some abandoned superhighway."  --Tyler Durden

        *Disclaimer*   if you are sensitive about your religious beliefs or are easily offended by strong religious philosophy then i suggest you not read this post .....i am not trying to offend anyone or hurt anyone's feelings.... i am simply writing my thoughts..and i realize there are philosophical holes in my thinking but since they are   my thoughts   i get to have it that way....if you read it and are offended, please forgive me, it is not my intention.     More and more i find myself thinking that maybe organized religion is not the best way to connect with God. Which i think is the entire purpose of religion to begin with, connecting with a higher power on a spiritual level. Realizing our limited existence and how ignorant we are of the truth. But is an organized religion necessary to accomplish this ? Perhaps a religion helps but does it have to be one of the major religions ? Why cant a person follow a set of ideas or principles, even rituals without having to subscribe to the entire kit 'n kaboodle package of a particular religion. Im sure most of you are thinking that I just want to pick and choose my religious beliefs. I would argue that this is not the case. I really think that without an organized religion perhaps we as mankind could achieve a higher spirituality and certainly more peace than with religion. Why ?  Look at all the wonderful things religion has brought us.....how many millions of people through out the span of time have claimed that in the name of religion they have started wars, killed others, taken over thrones and tried to convert others. Granted some of these things may have happened anyway without organized religion but the fact is that religion was the justification for so many actions. Recently and anciently man has used religion to justify his reasons for lots of things....especially war.. this is just one small example of what i am talking about.    More to the point, i find many people try to take religion too literally....they expect that their religion will tell them about every single thing in this world and how to deal with it as well. The truth is that no book or religion talks about some things that have come into our lives....like the internet, or deep space travel or stem cell research...the fact remains that no religion explicitly forbids researching on stem cells or using the internet.....so how can one say that a religion encompassses everything...Truthfully, the religions of the world are based on ancient societies and have the most relevance to those worlds...The time of Moses,  Jesus, or Mohammad (Peace be upon them), the religions of the world apply to their time, not ours....  But despite this I will say that every religion's teachings are applicable to this world and are timeless. But not in a literal sense, the teachings are guides to Help us along the path of righteousness.....along the path of good... (i sound like yoda) i do not believe they are meant to be taken literally, word for word...rather they are meant to be interpreted...which is why i feel that organized religion prohibits the interpretation of the teachings....because every person's interpretation will be different, and thus making organized religion rather difficult with so many different interpretations....but the fact is that within each religious sect there are many divisions anyway, so why do we continue to try to make everyone believe one way of thinking....  i dont think there is ONE right path.....i believe we are all on many roads to the same end.....no religion preaches being evil or mean to one another..they all teach peace and love for the world...respect all men as you would respect your brother...whatever changes man has made to God's word is our mistake, not that of God or the message He has sent to Help us...exclusivist thinking of religion has only served to divide man and cause death and destruction in its wake.....look at history and see how many wars have been fought in the name of God's Will...including this war we fight today....the extreme-ists on both sides say they are doing God's work, on one religious extreme you have Osama Bin Laden and on the other you have George W. Bush....both screaming out to the people of the world that they are doing God's work, by fighting the evil in the world.....sadly both men are deluded in their thinking........I do not believe that God would ever want war, He would never want his creation to destroy itself just as you would not want your brothers to destroy themselves.....so then why do so many claim it is God's will to destroy the very thing God created out of His love ? I dont understand it.....  No, mankind must continue to force our will upon one another...we will always say "I AM RIGHT" and fight over it....and claim that it is the way of our religion....that it teaches us to do these things when in fact no religion teaches war.....no religion teaches murder...rather than try to spend our short time on this world in peace or even trying to achieve peace we seek to destroy everything we have created in the name of religion when in fact it is nothing more than greed.....its human beings who have indeed perverted God's message......and it is in no way a small perversion....the major religions of this world in no way resemble God's message of peace, love, and respect for your fellow human beings......they stand for war, hate and arrogance.......  these religions dare to render judgement on every one else on the planet.....the clerics, clergymen and imams dare to play God and tell us who will be going to Heaven and who will be going to Hell.....if there is such a place......they tell us that if you say these few words, that somehow you will be saved from the eternal damnation of Hell......and we all cower in fear before the thought of such punishment.......who are these people to say who is right and who is wrong ? they are more concerned with the transgressions of the rest of the world and somehow overlook their own mistakes......they want to act as if they are higher or better than the rest of humanity...that somehow they are the "chosen" people ......God has given them His blessing they say and that allows them to look down their noses at the rest of the world.......all these religions teach humbleness yet all of these religious believers will tell you how they are the ones who are going to Heaven and everyone else isnt......is this humble? how can you render judgement on someone when you have no idea what the basis of the judgement is ? only God knows what He will judge and who is going to go to Heaven or not..........  On a personal level, this idea that this world is a test (which is something that i have been taught since i was little) and nothing more than a test completely trivializes the existence we have on this earth.....why would God create us and give us life, free will, and intelligence, only to test us ? based on rules that He sent down thousands of years ago ? for a moment look at how God is portrayed in the major religions....on the one hand He is kind, forgiving, merciful and full of love.......on the other hand He is angry, vengeful, and vindictive......if you dont do what He says when He says it, you are in a world of trouble.........He punishes those who do not say the words that He wants mankind to say, or those who do not eat what He wants them to eat, or eat what He wants them not to eat.......now i am not trying to be disrespectful, but either we as mankind are very confused as to the temperment of God , or God himself has one hell of an identity crisis........I take issue with the idea that this life is a test, God didnt create us just to test us to see if we will do what He says......if He wanted us to do what He says, then He wouldnt have given us free will.......He created us out of His love for us......He loves us so much that He would rather give us free will to do as we please rather than control us........Much like a parent, He is perfect in his philosophy that He does not want us to do anything that we do not want to do.....thats why we have free willl.....we dont have free will just to have it controlled by our mommy or daddy, or our religion, or society or by God himself.......if we choose to thank him for what He has blessed us with, if we choose to appreciate the wonderful world He has given us that is for our benefit......not his......He does not need anything from us....He doesnt need our prayers, rituals or worship......if God did need us to pray to him, tHen He wouldnt be much of a God would He........He would be an ego-filled, self-centered tyrant who only is pacified by having his minions bow before him at his every whim......NO, that is NOT God......God is the most loving, caring being this universe knows and He has given us this world so that we may reach peace and happiness while we live......and He has given us guidelines to use to try to get to that peace and happiness........  Why do we give God human qualities ? If he is not human, why do we make God out to be angry, happy, or sad ?? We say that if you pray to God, then he is happy and if you do something bad then he is mad......If God is a perfect being, all loving, all knowing, and all powerful......why does he get mad ? Wouldnt getting mad go against being all loving ? Isnt that a contradiction ? This goes back to my point about mankind being confused about the temperment of God.......either we are confused or God himself is confused, you can pick which one...........God is something beyond definition, beyond our understanding yet we have defined him in very finite ways, human ways......we have given him a throne, a pattern of behavior and in some religions, a son........all human qualities, if God does indeed defy definition then why are we defining him ? Are we that uncomfortable with the thought of a being that is beyond our understanding that we have to limit our definition of God ? Sadly, i would say yes we are.........  Im not living on this earth so that i can reach some higher plain of existence in a next life at the expense of my life here on earth..........I am trying to live as a good person in this world b/c i think it will bring me happiness during my life here.......and that is the most important part of "religion"  ....... living well......the minor details that we all have heart attacks over, like what we should be wearing, whether or not we should get tatoos, eat pork, or wear makeup....all of that is moot if you are living as an arrogant, selfish person......if there is going to be a jugdement  at the end of the world what do you think God is going to care more about ? Whether or not you ate the right foods or wore the right clothes ? OR Did you help your fellow man, make others feel good and take care of your family ?? In my opinion that is what is most important and that is what we should be concerned about........living as a good human being........

      throughout the last 5 years my sleep schedule has been very bizarre to say the least......i havent slept on any type of schedule in a long time....its always very turbulent.....much of it has to do with the stress i put myself under and the pressure i feel.....due to these factors i have had some rather strange dreams that all show a stressed and conflicted mind.......one of my more disturbing dreams occured about a year ago, i was on a plane and flying to some destination.....i got up from my seat, and started shooting everyone in sight.....i killed at least 15 people.....i ran out of bullets and so i started beating people to death....and one man in particular, my memory of me beating him to death is very vivid and very gory.......ive never seen anything like that in my life.......so after we finally land, all the surviving passengers pointed me out as the killer.....i get taken to a room where police officers attempt to interrogate me but i kill them too.....finally they handcuff me and take me out of the room....suddenly im outside my house in fort worth....my parents shocked and stunned, with looks of disbelief on their faces.....and i just think to myself "oh great, now they are gonna gimme a lecture" .....i find it comical that im thinkin they are gonna gimme a lecture after i killed about 25 people.........anyway as im walking away, i see my fiance.......i look at her and suddenly i feel like everything is gonna be ok..........i wake up.....and im sick to my stomach....literally....i felt like i was going to throw up.....and the entire day i was unable to eat anything......i tried to eat 3 times that day and everytime i took one bite, i felt like i was going to vomit right there.....it was by far the most disturbing dream ive ever had....  when i was a senior in high school, i again was putting myself under alot of stress, and i had a dream that started with me looking down upon a perfect square with 6 small go carts going around in perfect circles......in the dead center of the room are two people.....myself and a large person....as my point of view changes to the center of the room, i am talking to this other person next to me, and asking him how i can get onto these go-carts....because i really wanna ride em.......he says that i can get on the cars if i sample some of his cocaine.....and i tell him that im not a drug user, and that i dont want to take cocaine.....he says dont worry about it.......im looking around and one of the guys in the go carts is a very very big person, looks like a football player......i ask the guy next to me "who is that" and he says "that is mickey seualua, he was found unconcious in a car with mark tuinea,, the night mark tuinea was found dead from a cocaine overdose" ..........i thought that was interesting and i took the cocaine and got on the gocart.....i had a great time........when i woke up my radio alarm was going off and the radio station jockey was reading a breaking news report "This just in, Mark Tuinea found dead in his car this morning from a cocaine overdose, Mickey Seualua was also found with Tuinea, he was unconcious ....." Pretty cool huh ? My brain incorporated the radio broadcast into my dream in a very interesting way........i asked my high school english teacher, Mr. White, what he thought of my dream....Mr. White is a great guy who i talked to alot about my problems and thoughts, he was always receptive and offered great advice......He thought that the dream was a good one, he said that square, circle, 6 cars, 2 people........showed balance, everything in the dream was symetrical........he said not alot of people my age think in a balanced way.......whatever his interpretation was, its always open to new ideas.....a dream is just a dream......you can make as much or as little of it as you choose to..........i asked him about the cocaine, he said it wasnt cocaine but a new experience that i was nervous about.....cocaine was just a symbol for something new.........  another result of being under severe stress and sleep deprivation are hallucinations......after i moved out of my apartment at the end of my junior year of college, i spent a whole night packing up my belongings and moving them into a storage unit....it was alot of stuff and i was doing it all by myself........so when i started driving back home i was exhausted.....i was concentrating really hard to stay awake and concentrate so that i could drive......sometimes when you drive for a long time you fall into a trance and you quickly get out of it.......well i fell into one of those trances for about 45 mins......i drove only 50 miles or so, in the right lane.......but i couldnt recall anything about the last 45 mins.....i dont remember any song that i heard, land marks, or cars, exits......nothing......like i had been asleep for 45 mins while i was driving....but i didnt crash......well i pulled over, got a drink, ate somethin, and got back on the road....the sun went down and driving at night is never easy........as i was driving, i looked in the opposite lane and i swear i thought i saw a truck crash and flip over....but when i turned to look for the crash....there was nothing.......i was shocked......i continued driving.......and out of the corner of my eye i get the feeling that there is someone sitting in the passenger seat of my car......i turn my head to look and no one is there...but i could swear i felt a presence.......after a couple of minutes, i sense a hand moving from the passenger side up to the radio....i turn to look and nothing.......i say outloud "look, if you're cold or dont like the song, just tell me....if you wanna talk, lets talk, im bored, i could use some conversation..." unfortunately the ghost or spirit didnt respond.....it was a cool feeling, but at the same time, i was exhausted and really wanted to sleep.....

      So last winter i was walking out to my car to head off to the library to try and study the law (it sucks) and as i walked out of my building, an elderly man asked me if i could help him out, he needed me to help him hold the door to the building open while he got himself and his groceries into the apartment complex......this man is probably in his 70's or 80's and he walks with a walker.....anyway, i helped him get his stuff inside and get on his way, and i didnt think much of it and went about my business.....i think earlier this year, probably in january i helped him out again, just takin some stuff inside the building from his car, while he got himself inside.....yesterday, i was paying my bills online when i realized i needed my checkbook which was in my car...initially i thought ill get it later, i was feeling lazy......but then the thought just popped in my head that i might as well get it now.....so i went downstairs and walked out of my building and there was this man, waiting in his car, with his wife, and he called me over to his window and asked me if could help him and his wife get inside the building....b/c his wife had surgery on her knee so she couldnt walk around too well....so i did, and got some things out of his car, and slowly the three of us made it up to his apartment.....this guy is really just a sweet guy, he was talkin to me about the old days, talkin about his mom and grandma bout how they'd hang out near this lake and have fun.....and he was telling me all these corny jokes, and i smiled and laughed at them.....i just appreciated how nice he was to me.....and during the 30 mins i spent with him, i realized that no matter how strong, fast, or independent we feel we are, someday, all of us, are going to be slow, weak, and dependent on others..........i felt so humbled when i thought this, realizing my mortality and how small i really am.....we think of ourselves as invincible and immortal.....that nothing can affect us........but in reality we are going to be like this old man......slow to move, weak and relying on others to do things that at one time he was doing all by himself......and then i thought, how much i take forgranted in my life....about myself and the things ive been blessed with...i mean hell, i can run and jump out of windows, drive fast and do a one armed push up.....big deal right ? i mean who cares.....but i rarely realize how great it is that i can do all this stuff.....how lucky i am....cause im young...and im healthy...not everyone has the abilities that we take forgranted every day....watching this man, in his old age.....made me so humble.....realizing how human i really am......how one day im going to be like him........i just want to try to make the most of what i have right now.......instead of spending it stuck inside of a book.....or alotta books......  who knew i could turn helping an old man into a philosophical thesis??

      Ever since i was little, one of the biggest fears i had was making a fool of myself....you know doing something stupid, or something that other ppl will laugh at of make fun of......and as i grew up that seemed to be one of my driving motivations.....just dont look stupid........id be thinking this most of the time id be around a large group of people......and as ive gotten older, at times it still keeps me from doing or saying things that i would want to say....but b/c i worry about how it will make me look, i didnt do it....but nowadays im tryin to do things a bit differently....for the last 2 years or so, ive tried to be more open about who i am ......and about how i feel about things...or other people......now i dont worry too much about what other people think if they see me acting stupid or doing goofy things....which i do often it seems..........but one thing that seems to be a dominating factor in governing people's actions is the concern of what others will think of us...we worry about being too honest with someone or telling them how we feel because we are afraid that they will think we are weird or just flat out reject us........and not just by our romantic interests.....but by our friends in general.....no one ever wants to feel like their friends dont like them, or dont care about them......and because of that we sometimes keep people at a distance or dont tell them how we feel....be it good or bad feelings......now certainly when you have issues with your friends it can be a sensitive issue so being too blunt about it can be troublesome...but im talking about telling someone how you feel NOT when you have some complaint against them but when you want to express to them that you care about them and in my opinion if you care about someone, be it your close friend, or someone whom you would like to get to know better...you gotta be upfront with how you feel......and of course if your dream girl or dream boy walks into your life, wouldnt it suck if you never told em how you feel....now i know most of the time when you think about telling someone how you feel, you're thinking "well crap, if i tell em and they dont like me, or dont feel like i feel, then im gonna feel embarassed and look stupid." and thats true, you might be but whats worse ? (a) telling someone how you feel about em and maybe looking stupid or (b) telling someone how you really feel about em and having a chance at making your friendship/romance better or more meaningful not to mention saying what you feel to someone when you feel it......i cant tell you how much ive tried to keep that in mind, that if you have something to say to someone you should say it and not hold it in......mistakes of the past, im trying not to repeat.....but its alot harder than it sounds, because that fear of rejection is always there scaring the hell out of us......but more than anything else, we have to remember that all of us are trying to do things with good intentions....few of us are actually trying to hurt each other or make each other feel weird...but anyway, what im trying to say in my long convoluted way is that dont be afraid to take a chance and show someone how much you care.......if they reciprocate then great, you made just made a friend into a really good friend....if they dont, oh well...it doesnt mean ya'll cant be friends or still hang out....its just that person wants to keep your friendship at a distance....and thats not a bad thing necessarily..everyone in the world isnt gonna be your best friend.....but think about this, everyone likes to feel good, and if you express to someone that you really care for em (be it your friend or love interest) they will certainly feel good about it.....and if they dont feel the same way and you look/feel foolish then so what ? wasnt it worth it to make someone else feel good ?   like the chili peppers said, show love with no remorse.......

      So my neighbor who lives directly below me loves to grill on his little charcoal grill that he has on his balcony...well he does it all the time, and the lighter fluid fumes come directly into my room....at first i thought it was cause i had my balcony door open but i closed it and then it started coming through the a/c vents !! the intake for the a/c is sucking in the fumes, so for 45 mins every other day im breathing in these toxic fumes....it makes my stomach hurt and my head ache....i feel light-headed but not in a good way like when you smoke sheesha........like in a im about to pass out and die way.....AND i have this really old TV i took from my house last year, its like 20 years old or somethin.....well i think its about to die because my TV is starting to release fumes of its own....if i leave it on too long, this nasty burning smell starts coming from the back of the TV and its awful, i feel like im gonna throw up if im around it for too long....which really sucks cause ive been playing my xbox alot since i dont have that much to do nowadays........  The following is more for Naveed (my brother) than anyone else: so in NBA Live, i continued my franchise that i had started b4 with the Pistons, that had Dwayne Wade, Jermaine O'Neal, and Michael Redd......i changed the settings to the more realistic settings that i was tellin you about....In free agency i decided to trade away Grant Hill and Robert Horry, their ratings went down alot and their contracts were huge which was really keeping me from getting any help on my bench...I traded Robert Horry and Jason Kapono and got Devean George and I sent Grant Hill away for some guy named Borchardt..he is a power forward, he is pretty good i guess.....so my starting lineup goes like this Wade, Redd, George, O'Neal, Mihm.......I signed Chris Mihm to a mutli-year deal worth 150k/year (for those of you unfamiliar with NBA live, the numbers are points not dollars) and made him my starting center.....he is only a 59 right now but i think his ratings will go way up as a starter.....i picked up Charlie Ward, Mark Madsen, Wesley Person, and a couple of other guys in free agency..most of my bench i didnt get back from last season (by the way, i lost in the Eastern Conf Finals in Game 7, i simulated the playoffs, just for fun) Horace Grant and Brian Shaw retired and everyone else i didnt sign back or keep (i made some off season trades) except for Josh Howard, he is a scoring machine..........Sacramento won the NBA championship with C-Webb, Bibby, and Peja.....almost exact replica of the current Kings team....anyway, thats my NBA live franchise update........  Messege to Mark Cuban: You better have some big blockbuster deal coming this summer for the Mavericks......if you dont, you have alot of explaining to do for why you let Steve Nash get away....we needed him!!! You better get Shaq ......hear me Cubes ? You better get Shaq.....(but dont give up Nowitzki) I dont care if you have to dump the rest of the team but do not trade Dirk!!! Send Stackhouse, Walker, Podkolzine, and Delk along with new free agent (from Golden State) Dampier (sign him to a good fat contract, that will help match Shaq's fat contract too) and get SHAQ!! And then make a smart free agency move and sign Derek Fisher ! We need a good starting point guard and we all know Devin Harris isnt gonna do it (not yet at least) There is the Mavericks blue print for success, starting lineup for 2005, D-Fish, Finley, Howard, Dirk, Shaq......and if the Lakers still want more givem Bradley and Abdul-Wahad (stop for laughter) yea right, who is gonna take them ?
