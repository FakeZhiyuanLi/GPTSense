       by Peter J. Roberts   The Bahamas DNA Project was launched in June to support genealogy research. The administrator, Peter J. Roberts, a Bahamian with heritage in Marsh Harbour, invites others with Bahamian ancestry to join. Potential participants qualify for this project if they are male and their father's, father's, father's direct line is from the Bahamas, or if they are male or female and their mother's, mother's, mother's line is from the Bahamas.  Early results of the project show that sharing the same surname is not a guarantee of relatedness. Peter’s family from Marsh Harbour enjoys a legend that his great-great grandfather and two brothers sailed from Belfast and shipwrecked in Abaco. Despite this tale, Peter continued to believe that all the Roberts families in the Bahamas shared a common ancestry back to about 1720. When Peter compared test results with another Roberts from Key West whose ancestry is from Harbour Island via Green Turtle Cay, they found they were unrelated. It turns out Peter’s closest matches to date have Belfast or Scottish heritage.  Participation in this project offers additional benefits. It can help identify an unknown ancestor, such as Wyannie Malone's husband. His male Malone descendants carry his Y-chromosome signature, which passes virtually unchanged from father to son. A match between two of his distant male Malone descendants will reveal his signature or haplotype. If his haplotype is a close match with other Malones with ancestry in South Carolina then researchers would discover the family line that Wyannie married into.  Y-chromosome testing can confirm traditional genealogy. For example, an 18th Century Abaconian, Gideon Lowe, is believed to have had two sons, Benjamin and Matthew. If tests of a male Lowe who descends from Benjamin and another who descends from Matthew provide a close match, then we would know this genealogy was correct and that there had not been a non-paternity event in those lines. This is a significant result since about 3 to 6 percent of people do not have the father they believe is their father. Any other Lowe who tests and is a close match to Gideon's markers would confirm that he belongs to this same male line.  This project can also identify or provide clues of early ancestral origin. To date, Celtic and Anglo-Saxon haplotypes have been identified for participants. Additional results may divulge other European ethnic groups such as Norse Viking or African groups such as Yoruba, Hausa, or Kongo.  When applicable, the project will also test a participant’s direct female line through mtDNA, which passes virtually unchanged from a mother to her children. This test is less useful for genealogy purposes because mtDNA rarely changes. A perfect match with someone outside the project could indicate a common female ancestor within a couple hundred years or several thousand years ago. Because the match is with someone who shares a maternal ancestry in the Bahamas, however, there is a strong likelihood that the woman lived at some time since its settlement in the 1600’s. The challenge lies in learning who that ancestor was because of the patrilineal changing of women’s surnames with each generation.  Although discovering a match with another surname may be a worry for some participants, they need not be concerned about their privacy. The small portion of the Y-chromosome under analysis contains no genes that relate to medical issues or that will be of interest to insurance companies. Likewise, the area of the mtDNA that is tested does not provide enough information from which to draw any conclusions regarding medical issues. The portion of the DNA tested provides a distinctive signature for a lineage rather than for an individual, so there is no risk of the data being applied as an identity test for forensic purposes. Participants will also remain anonymous on the project Web site; however, to further genealogical research, they are requested to identify their earliest known ancestor in the Bahamas as well as that ancestor's descendants who have passed away.  Collecting a DNA sample requires only a simple mouth swab; no blood or pain is involved. The cost of the male-line Y-chromosome test is US$169 and the female-line mtDNA test is US$239. Since close relatives should receive the same test results, they may choose to share the cost to test one family member. This is a non-profit project and provides no financial benefit to anyone other than the testing company. Googling for “Bahamas DNA” will provide a link to the Bahamas DNA Project. It can be reached directly at  urlLink http://home.comcast.net/~libpjr1/bahamasdna.html  and additional information is available from Peter J. Roberts at peterebay@yahoo.com. Many of our early vital records for the Bahamas are incomplete or lacking altogether. DNA testing is one tool that can close those gaps and support genealogical research. In most cases testing will provide much needed confirmation and reinforcement of what we already know about the history of Bahamians. Having personal evidence of how your family line fits into our rich history can prove inspirational and quite rewarding.

       The Nassau Guardian , September 16, 2003, page A6    "You can do just about anything online these days - including test your DNA to determine your ancestry.  The Guardian received a note recently from one Peter J Roberts, a Bahamian at Georgia State University.  He proudly announced that his Y chromosome had been shown to match persons with Saxon or Scandinavian ancestry in England [I now know my ancestry is in Scotland].   Mr. Roberts traces his family back four generations in Marsh Harbour.  Another Bahamian Roberts [descendant], who traces his surname to the 1700's in Harbour Island - via Green Turtle Cay and Key West - most closely matched Irish males with Celtic ancestry.  DNA tests showed that the two were completely unrelated.  Both men are involved in an ancestry project at  urlLink www.familytreedna.com   Family T ree DNA testing can help find 'genetic cousins' by comparing the results of as few as two people.  According to one lab, males are able to see if another male is a descendant from their direct paternal line.  Women can determine which group they are part of based upon descent through their maternal line.  You can determine relatives through two of your eight great-grandparents by using DNA testing.  These services work in conjunction with existing genealogical records and help you fill in the gaps where no records exist.  There are [a] lot of genealogy sites on the web today.   urlLink www.rootsweb.com  is one of the better known.  And there are many black and white Bahamians (not to mention those of mixed race) who are actively pursuing their roots.  Perhaps the best known such project in The Bahamas is the genealogy of Hope Town, most of whose residents trace their ancestry to a loyalist widow named Wyannie Malone who emigrated to Abaco from Charleston, South Carolina after the American Revolution.  Although most inhabitants of Hope Town Have a copy of the "Malone bible" which details their interrelationships across hundreds of closely typed pages, no one has been able to trace Wyannie Malone's heritage beyond 18th century Charleston.  People of African descent often hit a similar wall when tracing their family trees because the period of slavery makes it difficult to conduct conventional genealogical research past the 18th or 19th centuries.  But DNA testing is allowing some to get partial insight into who their ancestors were and where they came from.  For a few hundred dollars, a DNA test is like the last piece of the puzzle to help people connect to their ancestors.  And one thing is sure, the more you know about your family's past, the more you want to know."
