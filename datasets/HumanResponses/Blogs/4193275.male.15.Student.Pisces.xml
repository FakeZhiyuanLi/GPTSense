      Going away tomorrow (oh, aren't holidays fantastic...), so the poor blog will be neglected all week, unless I can be arsed to find somewhere to get online, which isn't likely.  Bye for now, Daniel

      Fucking bastard fucking throat, it's driving me mad - I think it's the nasal decongestants, so I'll stop taking them for a while. Right now though, I want to physically rip out my throat (is that possible?) in order to end the irritation.  Heh, it reminds me of the episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm when Larry had a pubic hair stuck in his throat. (I don't have that though)  I am now officially obsessed with the Olympics, although I'm going away on Saturday so will probably miss most of the second week, which is fucking criminal. I've changed my mind about loving all Chinese people after they beat us in the Badminton thing, but I still love the main Chinese person (he's just so clever).  Oh my God, I have to write down my dream - it won't make sense to anyone reading it, but I like to record the best dreams that I have, and this is as good a place as any to do it.  My family did  something  to our house (I'm not sure what, but it basically resulted in us having an entirely different, and much bigger and better, house) and so for some reason we took in loads of lodgers. There was an American woman whose name I've forgotten, another woman called Patty, a man called Brian, this really cool psychologist woman who I love called Jenni Trent-Hughes, I think there might have been a couple but I'm not sure, and my two aunties on my mum's side. Also, Coventry was somehow by the sea, so the American woman was asking me lots of questions about the sea, such as how deep is it, and do I like to swim in it (I was getting quite annoyed with her). Ooh, and also I was auditioning to be on a quiz show, and for some reason this involved me having to fight an enormous monster, which I managed to kill just before it killed me. For the second audition I wanted to wear a shirt which I couldn't find, my mum had hidden it somewhere and I couldn't find it, and when I was looking for it I woke up and realised that I don't live by the sea, I don't have a huge house, I don't live with a load of cool other people, and I have no chance of appearing on a quiz show in the near future. I was so pissed off.  Daniel  P.S Oh yeah I got my AS Maths result which was a C, and as I was expecting a U, that was pretty cool.

      Oops, forgot to do this yesterday - you might think that that would mean that this one will be twice as good as normal, but somehow I doubt it.  Today I "practiced" "singing" (yep, they're both in inverted commas because it probably wasn't real practicing and it definitely wasn't real singing) with the aid of a really sad book, which you too can purchase at  urlLink http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/184442880X/qid=1092866238/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl/202-1114015-6414214  ! Despite the optimistic title, I really can't sing, but "singing" along to the CD is pretty fun. I also got another book, but the CD for that one features a strange robot woman instead of the lovely David and Carrie, so I don't like that one. My favourite exercise is number 12. You have to sing:  You're wonderful, you're beautiful X 4  but the "you're wonderful" has to be really loud and the "you're beautiful" has to be really quiet, but they still have to sound the same, so you can't just shout and whisper.  God, I'm sorry, I just realised how incredibly boring and sad that last bit was. Who the fuck cares what my favourite singing exercise is?  Daniel  P.S. I also like the one where you practice riffing.

      Aw I love the tennis so much...Venus Williams and Chanda Rubin are playing some Chinese people, and they lost the first set 7-6 but now they're winning the second set 4-1. I love all Chinese people (especially one), but I want the USA to win this one. Yeah, I'm still obsessed with it - I really should find something better to do, but it's just too much effort.  I think I'm becoming slowly forced out of my own family - today they went out without even asking me if I wanted to go! OK, I always say no, and I would have said no today, but it's still nice to be asked. Right now I wish they'd leave me alone though, because my brother wants me to play penalty shoot outs with him (even though he cries and runs away if I score), and my dad is constantly kicking me off the computer and interrupting the tennis (that is a sin). It doesn't matter though, if I get forced out of this family I'll just go and live with my auntie who already has five kids - I'm sure she won't notice another one.  God, right now a load of cheesy American people are waving at the camera. I would go on a big rant and slag off American people, but just in case any American people ever read this, I'll just say that the majority of them really give me the creeps, although I'm sure lots of them are very nice (maybe).  My brother is here again - this time he wants me to play his new pirate game with him. I've already played it three times, and he beat me every time (which is rather humiliating), so I'm not that eager to play it again, especially as it's  shit . I always feel guilty for neglecting him though, so I'll probably end up playing the damn thing again in five minutes.  Yay Venus and Chanda won the second set! Sorry, I promise this will be the last time I mention the tennis in my blog. Today.  Daniel

      Today was devoted mainly to the Olympics. I need to be careful though - I suffered severe withdrawal symptoms after Wimbledon, and the only thing that kept me going was the thought of the tennis in the Olympics. I have no idea why - I know fuck all about tennis, can't remember the last time I played it, and when I did, I'm sure I was awful - but whenever it comes on TV I become obsessed and can't bear to stop watching for one minute in case I miss a crucial point. I  hate  Tim Henman though, and I always end up pissed off when they invariably show decades of footage of him and then spend 10 seconds talking about the other matches.  I also attempted to carry on writing my novel. Yeah, I still haven't done any coursework, but I always find time to try and write this dreadful novel. I won't discuss the plot etc. on here (someone may steal my fantastic ideas (!) ) but rest assured you will never be reading it, nor would you ever want to.  I haven't developed any particularly good writing technique as yet though - I write pages and pages of stuff off the top of my head, read it all back, decide it's all shit, try and think everything through this time, write one paragraph in a few hours, then stop. At this rate, I'll be writing the damn thing on my deathbed.  I have similar problems writing this blog, although I'm pretty sure nobody's reading it anymore (am I right?), so  I don't worry too much.  Daniel

      I finished the book about the male prostitute. God, I do dissapoint myself sometimes - why do I read such complete garbage? He got fired from his job as a male prostitute, but it turned out that that didn't really matter anyway because he found the girl he loves being beaten up by her boyfriend and then he too got beaten up by the boyfriend and somehow the presence of an old woman was enough to make the violence stop and the old woman's demand that the boyfriend "leave my house" worked wonders and he was never seen again, and then some old man dies but nobody seems to care, which I thought was horrible, and the girl gets pregnant and then gets shot at a wedding but its only a film but he rescues her anyway, I don't know why, maybe because he spent the whole of the book being a vacuous self-obsessed boring tedious  twat . Anyway, after that festival of shite, I'm now reading...Anne Robinson's autobiography. Nope, I don't learn from my mistakes.  (Edited to add that the prospect of Anne was just too much, so I swappred it for a biography of Dusty Springfield, which I think is much more credible)  Daniel

      Hi Chris! Yes indeed I may be talking to myself, but I do that fairly regularly in real life also, so that's no big deal for me. Woo, just realised that a grand total of three (yeah,  three !) people have read my blog, which in my book constitutes world stardom.  I'm fucking sick of people asking me about holidays. I may be entirely alone in this, but I  hate  going on holiday. Maybe it's the fact that I actually have to do things with my family, maybe it's the godawful places they choose to go to, maybe I'm just someone who hates everything no matter what it is, but going on holiday is definitely one of my least favourite experiences. And  then , to make the whole fucking charade even worse, anyone I ever talk to ever feels the need to bombard me with the following questions:  "Have you been on holiday? Where did you go? When did you go? What was it like? What was the weather like? What did you do? Are you going on holiday again? Where are you going? Is it possible for me to ever stop talking about fucking holidays?"  Like I say, I accept that I am in the minority on this issue. Just, don't talk to me about holidays. Please.  Daniel

      As you may have noticed, I have come up with an ingenious way of bypassing the problem of not being able to think up titles - simply whack in the lyrics of the song I'm listening to at that moment! The words of wisdom above are from Sunday Girl by Blondie - yep, further evidence of my  fantastic  taste in music.  Hmm, what did I achieve today... Said goodbye to my cousins, watched Curb Your Enthusiasm, got dressed, watched more Curb Your Enthusiasm, had lunch, read my book (some complete crap about a male prostitute, I only got it cos I liked the picture on the cover...oops, I'd better just clarify, the picture on the front was not one of a male prostitute, or anything male prostitute related, it was in fact a nice hot air balloon), watched  more  Curb Your Enthusiasm, spent lots of time on  urlLink www.snopes.com  .... yep, that's about it. Tomorrow I will  definitely  do something productive. No, I can't make any promises - but I will  try  to do something productive. Don't hold your breath though...  Hey, Where Does Our Love Go has the same tune as I Can't Help Myself! One of the bands should sue, although I don't know which came first, so I'm not sure which.  Fucking weather - it's been raining all day, yet I'm still forced to wear sunglasses if I want to sit outside, which is just  stupid . And also, how come it was hotter than the  sun  (tm Alan Partridge) the other day, and now it's like this? That's also stupid, stupid and  mean .  I just realised that I use bold and italics far too much in this thing, so next time I will attempt to get through a whole entry without using either. I may have to resort to using pretty colours instead.  Daniel

      Grr...it always happens, I download a song (over a year of having broadband means that actually paying money for music is now an alien concept to me), fall in love with it, play it a million times, and then get fucking sick of it but can't stop playing it in my head and singing it and whenever I put music on it's like I  have  to put that song on. The current  fucking annoying bastard bloody song  is Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell... Yeah, OK, I know that nobody I talk to has probably ever even  heard  of that song, seeing as I have the musical taste of a 50 year old woman, but I thought it was worth mentioning.  Yay, I just realised, I managed to keep this thing going longer than one day! See, whenever I've tried to keep a diary before, I've written pages and pages of whining crap for one day, then neglected the whole thing until I find it weeks later and pathetically attempt to make stuff up for all the time that I missed. I've preserved my pathetic attempts, shoved somewhere in my room, should I ever wish to have a good laugh.  That said, I still don't think anyone is actually  reading  this thing (except Shelley, who left a comment on the last thing, hi Shelley if you're still there!), and I don't see why they would want to, but i'll still try and keep it up.  Hmm, I guess instead of the meaningless rambling I did yesterday and have done so far today, I should talk about my day, today. My three cousins are here - they're well sweet, but as they are 2, 5, and 6, they can also be  well  annoying. Right now I'm "babysitting" them and Owen, which sounds like a nightmare, but seeing as one is asleep, one is nearly asleep (although she is furious that "the boys" get to stay up later than her), and the other two are watching Shrek on DVD. Like I say, they're normally well sweet - aw, especially the littlest one - but there are times when I feel like ripping my ears off and hiding them just so I don't have to listen to them anymore. Grr, as I was writing that one of them came in demanding a plaster for a supposed cut on her foot - I'm sure that no such cut exists, but I went along with it, if it will make her go to sleep.  I'd better stop writing cos A) I'm getting bored, and B) I don't think anyone will actually read this, so bye bye, Daniel

      OK...I'm not quite sure exactly why I'm doing this, or what I'm even meant to be doing, or who is going to read it, or why anybody would  want  to read it, but reading other people's thingies is fun, so I thought I'd try and do one of my own. The main aspect of my life is boredom - see, it's in the title of the site, the title of this entry, and I'm already talking about it now. I guess saying that makes me sound like I'm complaining about how miserable I am, but I'm really not - I'm just, well, bored! The title of the site is actually fairly misleading - making boredom fun is not really possible, cos once you start having fun then you're no longer bored, so it's not boredom, so all you've done is kind of  kill  the boredom, so when it comes back it isn't fun anymore, and then...OK, basically, the stupid website insisted that I come up with a title, and I'm shit at things like that, hence the aforementioned misleading title. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to change it, but if I am then rest assured I will do so as soon as I think of a better title. If I  do  change it then none of what I just said will make any sense, but that's life.  See? Boring! Even I admit that that whole big fat paragraph up there is utterly BORING!  So what is this thing? I guess it's kind of a diary, but it isn't really - well, the ones I've read before seem to be quite different to most people's diaries, although I guess that's understandable. Who the hell would put their diary on the  internet , for a load of freaks to gawp at? Certainly not me. Anyway, past attempts at keeping a diary have been somewhat less than successful, which is what makes me think that I will give up doing this thing after a few days. Ah well, let's see how far I get!  I've just realised that although I set up this whole stupid website thing, and just wrote all that, nobody but me actually knows how to get to this, or even knows what it is. So, if you're not me and you're reading this, hi! You are either:  A) Someone who types in random names into this thing and, by chance, came up with mine. I'm flattered that you've read this far without actually knowing who the hell I am, but I also think you're kind of sad.  or B) This one is infinitely more likely - I decided to tell people how to get to this site, so they can read whatever shit I feel like  writing as and when I please. Oh my God, I finally have a proper site to put in the "my website" bit of my MSN profile! I will do that now to increase the chances of somebody actually reading this - if you do so, please leave a comment in the comments thing (dunno where else you would leave it) so I know you're there!  It's just struck me how fucking sad this thing is, but it's also kind of fun, and I prefer typing to writing, so I think I'll carry on with it.  Bye for now (even though there's nobody reading this except me, so I'm saying bye to myself, which is ridiculous, unless I was about to die, and I don't think I am (touch wood)) Daniel
