      hey it has been a while since i have posted anything.  Everything seems to be going ok.  We have about 28 school days left well at least i do.  I will be going back to Flordia for summer and i will be down there for about 6 weeks.  I know what everybody is saying doesn't it get kind of boring going down there 3 times a year but no it doesn't.  Well i am excited about Cassy's party.  I will make sure that my swim suit is "G" rated.  I will try my hardest not to wear my thong bikini.  Nothing much happened to me today except i saw like this 6th grader smoking pot witch is really gross.  I would never do anything like that.  well i am going to go.  TOODLES!!

      hey it has been a while since i have posted.  I have been very depressed today and it is mainly because of my dad and stepmom.  I came home Saturday from Flordia and it was very sad b/c i didn't want to come home.  After i came home on Saturday I went to the smokies baseball game i had box seats.  I saw Andrew Temple there and Mr. Hodges who was very drunk.  It was so funny to see him like that.  I went to the game again on Sunday as well.  I have to give a report in Latin tomorrow on the Titans(not the football team).  It's greek mythology.  I am so tired i didn't get much sleep on the count of I was watching I want a famous face on MTV.  There was this guy who had been taking these pills to turn himself into a woman and he had grown boobs but he was still a man in some places.  But he/she wanted to look like Jennifer Lopez and it didn't work. I was so gross.  Well I am going to go.  TOODLES.  P.S.  Cassy i will miss you.  I heart you.

      hey today has been fun.  Does any one know what it's like to be betrayed by your friends?  Well i didn't until yesterday.  Two of my really good friends have been talking bad about me behind my back(  you know who you are ).  Then i have another friend who thinks that I am strange and thinks that my conversations need to be out so that everybody can read them.  These three friends have really hurt me and if they don't want to apologize then they aren't really good friends.  I never thought that I would have friends who would treat me like this.  This is all that i am going to post for today b/c i am to upset to type anymore.  Bye

      Hey guys.  This will be the last time you hear from me.  I am shutting down my blog forever.  It just seems that everything i write in my blogs offends someone in someway.  And i have just hurt one my closest friends and i never meant to do that.  I only did it because i am still in love with them and i am just afraid to admit it.  It just seems that lately i have been trying to drive him away from me b/c i don't want to hurt him.  He deserves much better than me.  It hurts me so much to think that i have hurt someone so special to me and i just want to let him know that i am very sorry.  I hope that he can find it deep in his heart to forgive me.  I never meant to hurt him.  I know that i haven't been my self lately.  I have been going through some emotional changes and i didn't mean for these changes to change me in a bad way.  I am sorry for hurting our friendship and if you can't forgive me i understand.  I am the worst friend ever.  So i am shutting done my quiz also b/c there were some things that i shouldn't have put on there and it was wrong of me to use you (you know who i am talking about).  I just hope you will forgive me.  So consider this my last and final post.

      hey guys i have ended my quiz so don't try to take it anymore.  I am going to make a new one and post it so that you can take it.  I guess all of you have heard what happened this weekend.  If not then i gues i will tell you.  Dustin saw something that he souldn't have saw and it is all of Jena's fault.  He saw my BOOB!!!! i can't believe it.  Well what else could you expect of Dustin Mitchell Gamza.  I don't think that is how you spell his middle name.  But anyways i still don't know when i am leaving for flordia.  If you have any suggestions please tell me b/c i need to know.  I am so happy.  I found out that someone likes me but i dare not to mention his name.  It is very private.  but if you ask nicely i might tell you.  I am so tired but it can't sleep on the account of me being so happy.  Can i ask you a question?  Do you think i am fat? Am i beautiful?  I have been having some problems with my looks and i just need to know what you think of me.  Well i am going to go for now.  I am going to try to get some sleep.  TOODLES!!!!!!
