      recently I bought both taking back sunday cd's, and let me just say, they are rockin'. with alittle over excessive screaming on the first cd, but other than that, both cd's allow me to ROCK OUT. *clears throat* sorry. anyway. apparently some info on 2 games recently leaked out, and some people at bungie and the makers of half life 2 or getting a whippin'. thats correct. info on Halo 2 and Half Life 2 have leaked, for example, the fact that there will be 4 players split screen on Xbox Live for Halo 2, allowing ALOT of freakin' people in a game at a time. those dirty bastards, making the game even more bonable.....*shivers*....they will perish.

      My brother has been following the game formerly known as "Project Ego" since, well, it was title "Project Ego". and in the information I've learned from him i can tell you Fable will be one spanktastic RPG. Being the fact that RPG is my favorite game genre, Fable could easily become my favorite game of all time. Sure, to beat out The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time would be a rare accomplishment indeed, Fable certainly has the potential to do so. Halo 2 better not leave space for game of the year just yet.

      If you want me to find any info on any type of game I'd be more than happy to search and dest...er...find the info you want. other wise, I believe I'll mainly be on top of Halo 2, Fable, Blink 182, KOTOR 2, and anything else I take interest to. wether it be the  urlLink www.ilovebees.com  mumbo jumbo or yellow cards ability to produce rock music with a violin(not as easy as it sounds folks) I am your posting slave. dont get any funny ideas.

This site will be dedicated to such things as my fav. bands, games, songs, movies, etc. AND of course, you guys. don't be afraid to poke around and just ask, "wtf?" cuz I sure as hell will answer you, and thats becuz I have nothing better to do then to tend to the needs of complete strangers. So welcome, and make yourself comfy, the best you can at least, cuz there are no couches here, just rocks. or something to that affect.
