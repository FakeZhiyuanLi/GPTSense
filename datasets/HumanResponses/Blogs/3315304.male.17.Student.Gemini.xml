      Someone finally told Dest how they really felt other than me, that makes me so incredibly happy! I’m not sure who said it, but Lydia had something to add to it. She said to Dest, “You’re a sweet girl, you just need to shut your fucking mouth!” Garrett, I’m sorry that I’m saying all this, but this is how I really feel. Dest made me sooo damn mad today; she was talking about how she hates when people talk bad about other people behind their bavks, but she was doing the same damn thing to Michelle. And Michelle is the last damn person I would stand up for, but Dest pissed me off sooo fucking bad! All I hate to say when I walked into the RamPage office was HYPOCRITE and Dod so completely agreed with me. I know I’m a hypocrite, but if I ever get as bad as Dest I hope someone tells me or knocks the hell out of me, one or the other!

      OMG! Today was like so incredibly great! Abie came home with me from school to go and see Awkward Romance perform. (They are like the greatest Christian band, ever! ROCK ON!) Well all I have to say about this afternoon before church is that I’m gonna need to start wearing chapstick like all the time now . . . ::naughty grins:: I don’t like chapstick, but I think it’s worth it . . . Did I mention that I love Abie, yet? No? Well I did now. The concert was great and all, but I think her and me would have had a better time, if we had stayed home instead . . . oh well . . .

      You lil' ass! I told you not to tell Dest what I had said! Now she hates me more than before, oh well i guess. I can't be angry, no matter how hard i try i can't do it. Well, not at least since me and Abie got together. (Abie, if you are reading this, I love you, Baby!) The only thing I can be is happy . . . Is that a good thing?!? If not it sure feels like it! Garrett, I may not be angry with you, but I'll still kick your ass, you lil' bitch! Now I know i can't tell you anything, without it being repeated! That's depressing, or it would be if I wasn't thinking about Abie . . .
