      Well, here I am, all alone, nobody to talk to. I'm Bored... I think I'll make this a place to write my poems even though I suck at writing poems coz I'm more of a story writer. Well since I have nothing better to do I will write a poem now. Here goes.  Yesterday, You didn't have a clue, Yesterday, I seemed a little blue, Yesterday, The truth I thought to tell, Yesterday, My life was a living hell.  Today, You're there with me, Today, My life is filled with glee, Today, The truth is told for you, Today, I still feel blue.  I may have come out but my life still troubles me. A little weight is lifted but theres still so much that hurts me. I still have to get used to the fact that things will be different. But even if they are good things, it makes me uncomfortable. My parents act differently, they think things that are wrong. I've always been like this, and just because I am who I am, doesn't change the reasons for the things I like. You who read this may not fully understand what I mean, You're not like me, but one day it will be better. One day... I'll be truely happy. I just wish to be happy... now.  Well ne way. Forget ur trouble come on get happy! You better chase ur cares away. lol I like that song. =P    FUNKY FUN AND STUFF! BYE BYE!

      I rushed my English work so much today that I lost my really detailed front cover and forgot to draw an important diagram inside it! Well ne way, who has used an electric roulet game that zapps your finger!? Well I HAVE! and i put both my fingers in it creating a full body circuit around my arms causing me to be highly zapped 3 times IN A ROW!!!!! Well, ne way... actually I don't know what comes next... APPLE!!!! ...no ... ... FINGER NAILS!!! Don't you just love finger nails? They're great. I could talk about finger nails all day long! They're really handy when u r opening a can of drink, and when you need to scratch ur bak! If finger nails didn't exist I wouldn't know what to do. They can also come in handy when u r trying to get barcodes off products that u hav just bought. Usually they just end up ripping though!  If I could turn back time, I wouldn't change a thing! But even in my prime, My heart forgets to sing. Secrets hidden so long, Have stopped me from myself, And when I find me soon, I'll prop me on my shelf.  Thankyou and goodnight! You've been a gr8 audience!

       OK OK  In my last blog which was a few minutes ago, I forgot to give a hot topic AND a joke AND i forgot to write the next installment of boagle, the boy who falls in holes. So here goes:   ALEX'S HOT TOPIC #2:  What ever you do, never and I mean NEVER put your face at the entrance of ball returners at AMF bowling. Coz you never know when a chicken is going to hit you in the head! I mean a BALL! Not a chicken!   ALEX'S JOKE #2:  What did the elephant say to the giraffe?   How did you ever get so tall and thin while I'm stuck in this fat, heavy body?  I KNOW I KNOW! It isn't funny and really it's not a joke... but I didn't have any on hand!   Adventures of Boagle, Episode 2:   It was the weekend and boagle felt like riding his bike, so he went out the back and  fell in a hole . Then he got on his bike and  fell in a hole . He rode around the block three times and through Horty Torty School twice. Then he sat down and  fell in a hole . So he sat down on a grassy knoll. He got out his sandwich which was actually a  hole  and he  fell in it . So he went and  fell in a hole . On his way home he  fell in a hole  and then he  fell in a hole . Around the corner he  fell in a hole , and in the driveway, and at the door, and in his room. So he came to the conclusion of watching where he walks, so he immediately...   ...fell in a hole.    STAY TUNED FOR MORE BOAGLE!!!
