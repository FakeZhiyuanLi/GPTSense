          Pet Peeves Of Your Local Trader Joe's Worker        At the Cash Register     1 ) If your groceries have been bagged, don't say " Oh I meant to tell you plast." Or even worse, look at them blandly and say " I wanted plastic."   If we've gone and bagged your groceries already ( while you stood there and watched us impatiently because you're in SUCH a hurry that you couldn't handle two bags on your freakin' own ), just deal with the fact that you weren't paying enough attention when we said hi to you, to simply request your preferred baggage to begin with !   2) The credit / debit terminal, this is important, and you're about to use a skill that everybody hopes that you can use later........    READ THE INSTRUCTIONS  . They're on the screen. The screen is that glowing screen-like thing in front of your face. You know, bib height. Use it, read it, and shut the hell about with the " Ok, I already slid my card. " Well did it say slide it? or how about the ever popular " It says processing, what does that mean?" or " It wants me to choose debit or credit." This last one is bad because, jesus man, it's YOUR CARD. Don't you even know how that card, which has DIRECT access to your banking account, and can be used by ANYbody damn near ANYwhere, WITHOUT I.D. these days? You don't even know HOW it can be used?? They even tell you when you get the card! That's their entire soul purpose to exist, is to be a convenient and quick way to access your money.   3) If you get in line, then leave your basket and walk off to do more shopping, damn right I'm taking the peson who's standing right behind your cart. You snooze, you looze.  4) If these were listed sequentially in order of piss-me-offedness, this would be No. 1 I think. This might be a shock to some of you rush hour zombies out there, but I buy groceries too, and when I buy those groceries, I too, like my eggs to be on top. And my cold stuff together. No fucking way is somebody who works at Trader Joe's, and has worked there long enough to learn how to open a paper bag, is going to put a canteloupe on TOP OF YOUR EGGS. DON'T TELL US NOT TOO. YES, WE'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR MOTHERFUCKING DOUBLE RAINBOW VANILLA BULLSHIT RIPPLE TUB WITH YOUR LEMON COCKSUCKER YOGURT BLAST. COLD SHIT GOES WITH COLD SHIT! Goddamn, do you seriously think that some mother fucker working in a grocery store as hippy as ours doesn't fucking KNOW THAT??!? Jeeeee-Zus, and to think that the company tells it's employees that most people shopping with us have a college education. Please see No. 5.   5) I know you only came for one thing. Thanks. As a fellow I know once said, " Welcome to Trader Joe's, shop and get out."

       Monday, I had today off. Three days off this week, it's going to be a skimpy paycheck. Jess wanted to go out to lunch, she picked up the tab as I'm a little worse off than flat broke, I had a burger w/ bacon and bbq sauce, she had a taco salad. The dogs are asleep on the floor right now, and a Matrix movie is ominously chattering in the background of the room, making somebody a few more million dollars.   A guy at work yesterday, Jarrod, was spouting that the new " I Robot" movie starring the Fresh Prince is likely to get sued by the Warschowski brothers, the makers of said Matrix film. I had to off and let him know that Issac Asimov actually wrote " I Robot" years before the Wski. Bros. had even thought of a computer based flick.     Kovach and Marco just got their promotions. They were ahead of myself on the list, so I didn't exactly get passed up, but it's kind of like watching the school bully get three wishes granted by a travling magic djini while the sick kid with dead parents get's detention. Kovach is hands down one of the most useless fucking people we have around, and she's taken to letting every person within earshot know that she got promoted. Off with her head I say, but I had best be sure to make a reference to The Red Queen lest the Dept. of Homeland Supression read my blog and arrest me for threatening her life.    Jess and I have both quit playing EQ, and it looks like Lineage 2 is shortly to follow. Working out is starting to finally be a real option again -- oh oh, Neo just saved Trinity by will power alone, how sweet ! -- and it's good. I went to Yoga for my first time, and while I wasn't super super impressed, it didn't suck all the way. The girl to my left was quite possibly one of the most attractive females I've ever beheld in person. Her body was perfect, great hair, dressed nice, had a cute little necklace on, nice complexion, etc. etc. Great boobs. You can't lose with great boobs. You can hand me a fifty pound block of cheese and if it has great boobs you've got my attention. Not that being handed a fifty pound block of cheese would ever FAIL to get my attention , but you know what I mean.
