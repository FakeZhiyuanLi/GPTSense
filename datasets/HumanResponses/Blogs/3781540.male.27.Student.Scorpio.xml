       urlLink    Here is another picture of Hutch. As you may be aware, Hutch spent five years defending your country. Now, after bettering himself at university he is £20,000 in debt. He is poor and unemployed. Money is going to start leaving his account at a great rate of knots in the near future and no-one seems to want to employ him. With this is mind, it would seem that he has only one more option open to him. He is going to grow a beard of some description, start wearing glasses and move to South America to start a new life under the name of Eduardo. With his previous military experience and financial prowess (!) there is little doubt that he will soon end up as either a drug baron or the dictator of a small country. In  order to counter this it is suggested that if you ever meet Hutch you should buy him a drink or, if you are in a position to, offer him a job in a financial institution (he has an MSc Finance and Management by the way). After all, could you live with yourself knowing that you had it in your power to stop a dictator before he gets going?&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    The British Army (2006)?   British Army News I: I read with interest in Bombs and Guns Weekly that the American Army now has more smart weapons than smart soldiers. In fact, according to a recent pentagon release, the smart bombs will now be doing all the thinking which will allow the Americans to realise savings by only employing extremely stupid soldiers. It is interesting to note that the Ministry of Defence has eschewed this approach in favour of not spending  much in the way of smart weapons whilst at the same time not spending much in the way of anything else either, including manning. Below is a recent excerpt from Hansard.  Chancellor Gordon 'Fatboy' Brown:....and the defence budget will be reduced to £14.50 by 2006.    Defence Minister Buffhoon:..which will leave us with 3 soldiers and a Datschund called Colin. These will be more than enough for the operations we are currently mounting in 46 different countries.  Prime Minister Bliar: Wibble.  Unemployed Bum Hutch: Wayne who...?  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This man defended your country! No fucking wonder we are invaded daily by terrorists disguised as orphans!!!!! The above photo is hutch, a man who is deceptively hard! Or is he? I mean is hard mincing round in your pyjamas with people who can't even punch? Or being an army receptionist? I think he answered the phone or something.  The one redeeming feature of the man named after a bunny home is that, in the good old tradition of british squaddies, he fucking hates everybody. Well at least everybody who he has ever met! After a failed attempt to be employed by Goldbergs Sack he is now turning his career toward the comedy route as offers flood in for him to front Whiteadder the new british tv show. He is currently in acting school learning to be a sarcy ex-soldier with a vicious social streak! (shouldn't take long). For a man so vehemently english, Hutch refuses to watch harry potter and while the nation came to a standstill to watch us lose on penalties again, he calmly read his paper in the middle of a crowded pub wondering what all the fuss was about.  However, he is a massive fan of Wayne Bridge, and fawned like a schoolgirl when he met his childhood hero face to face.  Stew  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    The photo above is of Stew who's currently finishing off his MSc Sports Psychology at Loughborough University. That's like a real masters, only without the work. He was captain of the Uni American Football team this year. "The what......?" I hear you cry. Yes, people do actually play American Football outside of the USA. Apparently it is an infinitely varied sport with a multitude of specialist positions and tactics. However, Stews job is to dress up in more armour than a copper on may-day and sprint forward two metres in a straight line into people. Head first. Repeatedly.  Talking of team sports, Stew had a bit of a result with one of the lovely ladies of Loughborough Uni earlier this year when he earned himself an "assist", if you get what i mean. His partner for the "play" was (Tiny) Dan, (tiny referring to his stature you understand) who is the teams quarterback. Well done lads, you are both fine representatives of the Uni and prove that when the going gets tough the offence and defence are more than happy to work together as a team. Oh yeah, Stew will be contributing to this blog as well.&nbsp; urlLink
