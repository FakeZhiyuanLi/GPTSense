      Well he got his money mailed about a month from when he saw me. I just hope the lady who talked to me on the phone will stick to allowing me to pay the $25.00 per month. I just have a hard time trusting Doctors offices as I was lied to three years ago and I ended up getting a collection agency after me.  I also left a note with my payment telling them that my Indigent application is still being processed and I will mail them a copy of my CICP card once I get one (if I do).  I think though they will be willing to work with me, but we will see.

      Well, I got my text books today and now the students are coming back to the dorms. I can't believe it is the fall semester again! This year has gone by so fast!  Also, I called the hospital today about my Indigent application and I talked to that guy who knows what he is doing. Anyways, only one thing they need for my Indigent application is proof that I receive in-state tuition. So I called the registar of my university and I will pick up a letter tomorrow saying that I pay in-state tuition. I will then mail it off to that guy at the hospital.  Also, I haven't received any new bills yet. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that hopefully Dr. H dropped my $1,300.00 medical bill, but we will see.  Also, I applied for two jobs on campus last week and I had one interview to work in a computer lab. There was a lot of competition though for this job and they said they would let me know sometime this week if I got it. I think now that since it is Thursday and I have yet to hear from them that is a big sign that I didn't get the job. Oh well, I will keep looking.

      Earlier this month, I wrote to Doctor H. who performed surgery on me three years ago. I did something I'm not proud of, but I did beg him to stop billing me. I told him that my financial situation has changed compared to three years ago and that I am now an unemployed full time college student. I told him that I have been paying him the $25.00 per month on time for the last three years and how I wish he could just drop the $1,300.00 I still owe him. I to be safe, did mail him a check for $25.00 and I told him if he wants to cash it he can, but I hope he doesn't. I just did this so they won't send a collection agency after me. I also sent him proof that I am receiving financial aid from the university I am attending and I also sent him a copy of my lease so he can see how much my rent is per month.  I looked at my bank statement last week and he did cash the check. I think it is a bad sign, but there is a little bit of hope that he will drop the remaining charges. We will see, but so far I haven't recieved any bills from him. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. But probably he will keep billing me since he needs his $1,300.00 so badly.

      It has been over 2 weeks since I applied for Indigent help from the hospital I went to in July. I still haven't heard anything. The guy on the phone said that I should qualify when I talked to him about two and a half weeks ago. I then called last week to see if I got it and I got some girl who didn't know what she was doing (the guy who knew what he was doing must have been on vacation-typical). She said something about calling in a week and a half. She said if I do receive Indigent financial help that I should be given a CICP card to send to the people who bill me (like the doctor who saw me).  About the doctor who saw me in the emergency room last month (let's call him Doctor S.) right away bills me $326.00 for his services. I called his office right away and told the woman that I should be receiving Indigent help from the hospital and I explained how my income is only $14,000.00 per year with student loans and grants. She seemed disgusted at me that I don't have health insurance and said that they can't get rid of all of my debt, but once I send them a copy of the CICP card they "can give me a discount." She said they would take half off of what I owe, so I should owe around $163.00. She was very snobby to me and not very understanding by her tone. I then asked her what is the lowest amount I can pay per month and she said $25.00 is fine. People sure can be cruel! It really makes me hate doctors in a way since they are so expensive and not understanding that not everyone in this country has health insurance.  I also am still waiting to hear from the ambulance company. They should be the second highest expense next to my 4 hour emergency room stay (but if I get Indigent help the ER stay should only cost me $25.00).
