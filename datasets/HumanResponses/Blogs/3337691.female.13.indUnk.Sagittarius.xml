      Hey  Sharks lost yesterday. It's ok though. They had a great season! They played really well throught out the whole year. If only Cheechoo and had recieved that pass and scored. They were sooo close to *tieing up the game! with only like 10 secs left. Oh well. I have a feeling that they are going to do hella well next year!  Lulu    * I can't spell lol

      Hey, Today was sooo fun. Went to Animals on Broadway from 10 am to 430 pm, my mom had a booth down there so we stayed there the whole time. I even think I won the Pet Poker Run thing (only grace will know what i am talkin about )! I was going to go to a b-day party but I started to feel really sick. I still kind of feel that way, but I am better. I am on my dads laptop right now our computers like not working. I am the only won up right now, except my dad, my mom is takin a nap, my brother is taking a nap and my dad is on a bike ride. I better finish this up because my brother just woke up and is yelling at me to type in a different room because he is trying to fall asleep. Oh he just needs his beauty rest, god! Sharks are taking on the Flames tomorrow, so I probably won't be on very much between the game, need to root them on!  Lulu

      Hey, omg i am so glad that it is summer! i just got back from vacation yesterday. We went to Catalina Island like we do every year. It has been getting kind of boring because for 2 years in a row we haven't gone snorkling because the weather has not been very nice. :( Next week i have soccer camp! I am so happy. #1: i luv to play soccer #2: i will get away from the house and will acuatly be waking up early! lol. I luv to sleep in. so i will get back on schedule when i go to soccer camp. today i slept into 12:00. hahha. i was so tired. the last time i slept in that late was a year ago. i just luv summer. stay up untill like 12:30 and wake up at 12:00. well i am like bored right now, u must have noticed because i am writing alot, none of my friends are home and i don't have that much to do. Well lets see....umm when i was at Catalina, I went miniature golfing, and saw harry potter 3. That movie was much better than the first 2! and it seemed shorter because it was better, even though it was like 2hrs and 21 mins! lol. i also went shoppin and fishing. Omg i am never going fishing again! the poor little fish! i caught 2 fish. the first one was ok when it was hooked to the hook, we got it off and threw it back right away. but the second one was well kind of sad, the hook was like caught in its eyelid!! I had to turn away when my dad was taking the hook out! it only took like 30 seconds but it seemed more like 5 mins. lol ok well i have to go. ttyl!     Lulu
