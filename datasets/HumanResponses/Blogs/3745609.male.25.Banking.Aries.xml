      So today I had to confront my second in command.  Long sotory short, I run a bank branch.  I'm the branch manger.  I have an assistant manager of sorts.  Officially, my title is Banking Center Manager and her title is Banking Center Service Manager.  In the simplest of terms, she's underminig my leadership and team building by, when I'm not around or not looking, being mean, condescending, snappy and generally lording her authority and title over my staff making them feel stupid.  They hate her and come to me and complain that she makes them feel small.  Futhermore, she decided to schedule me some 48 hours this week, taking her need to balance scheduled hours to salary budgets out on me by making me pick up the slack (I am not overtime eligible so regardless of how many hours I work, I get paid the same salary).  48 hrs doesn't sound like much, but given when I actually get to the bank and when I actually leave and the fact that I don't take lunches means she's asking me to work 60+ hrs.  This is unacceptable.  I had to confront her over this.   How do you tell one of your employees that all the other employees hate the way she talks to them and some are considering leaving as a result.  When the person you're confronting is also a manager, you're telling them they are a bad leader and are in danger of losing any loyalty they may have gained.  You run a huge risk of crushing her sense of self worth, worsening her performance and making your problem worse.  The alternative is to have my Banking Center descend into the seventh circle of hell because my staff doesn't want to come to work anymore.  If you hate your boss and you think he/she enjoys correcting you, you're mistaken.  I hate having to correct bad behavior.  It's hard.  I had to try to tell her she was alienating my staff and doing a por job and pissing me off with her scheduling and make her not feel bad about it and have a sunny picture of the future and my outlook on her.  I could see her tearing up a little when we had the talk, but she didn't out and out cry.  She kept a stone face, but I could see she was hurt.  I told her that I thought she was working too hard and needed to take more time for herself and her husband.  I told her I'd grant her extra paid time off whenever she needed it to regain balance in her life so she could once again relate to the staff and customers in a more pleasant manner and enjoy her job so that her tellers would too.  She hated that.  I think she thinks I'm telling her that I don't need her or that I'm trying to manage her out.  That's not the case.  But she DOES need a vacation.  She DOES work too hard and she IS mean to my tellers!!!  The thing that hurt her feelings the most was that I rewrote her schedule to fix the hours.  I think that said to her that I don't trust her to fix the problem on her own.  Well, I don't I guess.  I've been asking her to write the schedules in a certain, fair, delliberate way from day one and she never does.  The schedule I wrote for her worked, the hours balanced, and I wasn't scheduled to work 60+ hrs.  In fairness to her, it made her hours a whole lot better and gave her more time to be with her husband.  Maybe that's the problem.  Maybe things aren't going well at home.  Perhaps that's the stress she's under and perhaps that's why she doesn't want to take time off.  I don't know.  She's a part of my staff, even if she helps me manage it and thus, she's important to me.  Her wellbeing concerns me.  In the end though, it is the success of my banking center as a whole for which I get paid.  I care about each member of my team, but at the same time I can't allow one member to ruin the others.  Being the boss is lonely.  It put me in a bad mood today and my staff saw it.  One of my tellers offered to "show me her tits" to make me smile.  She was kidding of course, you'd have to know her to understand.  She is known for jokes like that to make people smile.  It helped.  Remember, I place a premium on silly.    One of my male personal bankers asked me in the lobby if a hug and a kiss would help.  I laughed and told him I was OK.  He continued and said, "We don't have to do it out here, we can go in the back if you're uncomfortable about it."  I love it when my staff jokes with me, especially if they can see I'm stressed and they're trying to cheer me up.  It shows they care too... even if I shouldn't let them see when I'm stressed.  I love them all.  They work so hard and we're doing so well.  That's why they issue with my assistant mgr is so rough.  I hope she'll be OK.  I hope she'll turn around.  The other thing that made me sad today was my laptop.  It didn't show.  I suppose it has a long way to travel.  It's coming from Wappingers Falls, NY.  Where the hell is that?  It's a long way from Reno, NV.  I hope it comes tomorrow.

      well, I bought a laptop.  I know, as impulse buys go, laptops can get pretty spendy - but I was sensible.  I bought a used laptop on Ebay for $117.50.  Not a bad deal.  It's an older Dell - a Pentium II 300mhz 128mb ram 6gb hd running Win 98.  Not bad for the money, but what would I need with such a machine?  It can't exactly keep up in today's world.  The bargain basement computer on which I'm typing now that resides in my home is nine times faster with four times the RAM and it runs an operating system not named after a year in the Clinton administration.  The answer is simple.  I have two desktop computers at home, and old and a new but neither can travel with me to work, a trout stream, a park or a cafe.  You may notice my earlier lamentings of my lack of writing of late?  How much computer do you need to write books?  Not a whole lot.  I wrote my first novel on comperable machine, and a near exact copy of this notebook was issued to me by a company for which I worked four years ago and I used it for my writing more than for work.  In short, I wrote when I had a laptop.  If one can be had for under $120 that can do what I need, it's perfect.  Anyway, I ordered it last week and expected to see it possibly by Friday, but it didn't show.  I feel good that it will arrive tomorrow.  I dug out my old laptop bag that I used to carry the company laptop around in four years ago and started to clean it up.  It was like a time capsule.  In it I found my old business cards from that job, miscelaneous papers from that time, scribblings, fragments of dialogues, stories and journaling nonsense and marked up printouts of my completed book and my in-process novel which had hit a bump in the road pending a firm decision of what to do with the climax and the fate of the characters.    I read a good chunk of Secrets in the Sage (my unfinished work) while cleaning out the bag and found myself energized.  I can't wait to resume work.  I have since modified the storyline, solved the climax problem and I think I have a very publishable work on my hands.  I know that with this laptop, I will write again.  I hope I can fit it in my work schedule.  It's late.  Tomorrow is a huge day.  I have a major confrontation with my Customer Service Manager, my most direct subordinate and essentially my right hand in running the bank.  I'm very unhappy with her performance in just a few important areas and I have to put a stop to it before it causes a loss of quality staff and/or my sanity.  She won't like it, but nobody likes it when the boss takes them aside to address something they're doing wrong or poorly.  I'm not looking forward to it.  Anyone who thinks they're boss likes reprimanding or correcting them is mistaken.  Any boss who does shouldn't be in charge.  Bed time.  Later.

      So who am I anyway?  There must be context in order for this whole thing to work and while I've added several bricks to the great wall that is my history in print, there's not enough room nor is there call to include all that here.  Furthermore, if you're reading this now, you wouldn't care.  So I'll try to condense things.  Here's the right now:    I'm 25 and I live in Reno, NV.  Sparks, NV to be exact, but in reality, they're sister cities and even I'm not really sure where the definitive barrier between the two municipalities is or even if one exists.  I'm a musician, a cook, a flyfisherman, a writer, a hobbyist, a history buff and a mountain biker.  I've skied most of my life and live for the fast and the steep.  I love to camp and hike, I can sing - I love complicated choral pieces and can hold my own in even as many as 16 part harmony.  I have an interest in nuclear weaponry and testing and read most anything on the subject I can find and have even gone so far as to take a tour of the Nevada Nuclear Test Site.  I place an extremely high premium on silly.  I love silly, though dry wit and sarcasm are also my friends.  I'm a Christian, strong in my faith though all too aware of my sins and sinful desires.  I have a strong feeling of unworthiness that dogs me and prevents me from having the truly close relationship with God that I would like.  I play worship music and it is the foundation of much of my guitar knowledge and history.  I play electric guitar, lead and rhythm, and have for 14 years, though I've played guitar for four more.  I play a Stratocaster though I recently bought a Les Paul that has become my new all in music.  I was a fat kid, a fat adolescent and a fat young adult.  Three years ago, I decided to make a change, lost 86 pounds over the course of a year and took up distance running to stay in shape.  Today, at six feet tall, I weigh between 164 and 170 pounds, have a 32" waist and though I love it, it puts my past in a new perspective.  I wonder how much being fat did to the shape of my character.  I know I have baggage.  I'm still working on that.  They say you can tell a great deal about a person by what they drive.  Well, I love my truck and I wonder what it says about me.  You be the judge.  I drive a 2001 Nissan Frontier Crew Cab SE 4X4.  For those who don't know, that's the little Nissan pickup with a short bed and 4 doors with a roof rack.  It's red, more like a maroon red.  Nissan calls the color "Salsa."  I bought it new 3 years ago and have no intention of getting rid of it.  However, I still miss my old Toyota.  It was totalled in a snowstorm.  It was a 1984 Toyota 4X4.  It was lifted, but not too much, the tires were big, but not too big and it was red.  I mean bright, stopsign cherry red.  You knew where I was in my little town.  For whatever that's worth, that's what I drive.  I like small trucks, I like red.  My mountain bike is red too.    I'm a Banking Center Manager for Bank of America.  In Layman's terms, that title translates to Branch Manager.  I love my staff and most of the time, I love banking.  If that turns you off, don't worry.  It takes a special kind to find banking interesting or even exciting, let alone rewarding.  I've done other things though.  I started out wanting to be a chef and pursued that dream for a time working under some well respected chefs.  In the end, I shunned the hours and the high potential for burnout.  I hope to someday return.  I've worked in customer service for a resort telecommunications company and later took a role in new product support and development there - my first shot at a position in any way autonomous, reporting to the high ups.  I failed quite miserably.  I've been a bank teller and a personal banker, an administrative assistant, a part time radio DJ, a grocery bagger and a software sales representative for a company that sold "solutions" to apparel manufacturers.  That job, though as close to hell as I've ever come, took me inside the world of fashion.  It's a crazy place.  I went to designer parties surrounded by industry insiders, runway models and posers who like to hang out with models.  I went to trade shows and rode in limos with the fashion elite.  Surreal.    My dream is to someday be a self supporting author.  I've completed one novel.  It's comedy/SciFi.  If that makes no sense to you, read Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.  Thus far, I've found getting an editor to read my stuff a tall order.  My query letters have made it past the readers on a few occasions, only to have compliments scribbled on them by the editor that always end with "not right for my list."  This rejection should be met by even greater persistence, but instead I've allowed my job to take more of my time than it has rights to and have shelved most of my fiction.  Nevertheless, I do take stabs at the occasional short story and here and there, peck away at my second book, a suspense thriller.  I think it has more potential to be published, but my first book is like my baby.  That said, I understand that most every author's first book eventually finds its way into the trash.  So will I ever publish?  I suppose there's a chance, if I put forth the necessary effort.  That is the key.  In the meantime, I'm deriving pleasure from other sources.  I derive greater pleasure than most, I believe from simple things, especially food and drink.  You can make me do anything if you have good sushi or an authentic taco.  A Hershey bar is happiness in and of itself and coffee is a necessity.  Simple pleasures.  I like simple pleasures and simple places.  I grew up in a little town.  Grass Valley, CA had around 7,500 people in it when I moved there and 2,000 more moved in in the 12 years I lived there.  I love small towns.  It's my hope that I will be able to go back to a small town someday soon.  Grass Valley is a little foothill town founded on mining in the gold rush.  It's rural, an hour from the nearest major city, Sacramento.  The dirt is red, the trees are green and it smells like mountain misery which for those of you who don't know, is a small plant that smells like home.  It snows once or twice a year and the snow almost never stays all day, and it gets hotter than hell in August, just in time for the Nevada County Fair which is held there.  It's the California you don't think of or hear about if you don't live there.  It's nowhere near L.A., San Francisco, or the ocean.  There's no plastic surgery and the town is politically largely conservative.  It's just over an hour from Lake Tahoe, which is where I was born and where a great portion of where my heart still lies.  I love Lake Tahoe.  I moved back there to go to college in 1997 and lived there for two years before moving down to Reno (which I mostly loathe by the way) where real estate is significantly less expensive.  That two year stretch taught me that Lake Tahoe isn't the same quaint collection of small communities ringing the most beautiful body of water God created that it was when I was born there or returned in the summers to play and the winters to ski.  It is, now, a lost heaping mass of soulless, bitter, unhappy wealthy folks from the greater San Francisco Bay Area who come there to jack up housing costs, pollute the lake, crowd the roads, eat Brie and expensive wine and look down on everyone who isn't them.  Don't get me wrong, you may have gotten from that last rant that I'm a bleeding heart liberal who has a problem with those who have more than I.  Such is not the case.  Remember, I run a bank.  I'm rather conservative and have very little problem with the affluent.  I have a problem with the affluent who are ruining Lake Tahoe.  The past?  When I was a child, I spent hours with Legos and my desire to make things explode.  Boys love fire.  In junior high, a pyrotechnic experiment gone wrong blew up in the face of a neighbor girl and I had a long talk with the police.  I lived on my bike (it's a wonder I could stay fat) and fished every chance I got.  Models, rockets, video games and exploring the woods around my house.  The usual.  These interests were secondary though, to my interest in girls.    In my memory, my entire childhood, not merely my adolescence was consumed with trying to figure out just how to get one of those mysterious girls.  Thank God I was fat and awkward.  Otherwise I might have landed one or two of them and who knows what that kind of pent up desire might have brought to pass.  The bad news is that this has not waned.  Oh, yeah, I'm married, have been for 5 years now, but I can't seem to cage this powerful motivation to look at, lust after and wish I had, most any woman who walks by or whom my imagination can dream up.  I have never, and I must repeat that word for emphasis, NEVER been involved with another woman.  I made a promise and I aim to keep it, but that doesn't stop this 13-year old mind of mine from wondering what it would be like and trying to convince me it would be better than what I have right now.  Remember those thoughts that dog me and which I hope to purge through this blog?  Well, there ya go.  But this is off topic and I'll get to this stuff in another post.  So what am I?   I'm an outdoorsy musician author who loves food, chocolate, and coffee.  I love small towns and women, loathe the snooty and I run a bank.  That's for the most part, me.  Well, a small bit of me.    That's your post for today.

      The first thing I must do is apologize for my initial post.  I had to put something in place before I could read other Blogs.  I needed to get a feel for this.  As I said, we never get it right the first time.  So now that I've been exposed to what others write, I've decided the purpose for my little Blog.  There's a tremendous volume of junk which clouds my head.  Sometimes I wonder if I think deeper than other people or if they simply have a way of dealing with it.  Perhaps they're in the same boat I'm in.  My feelings, my history, my hurts, desires, stuff that angers me and stuff that makes me laugh swirls in my head and never leaves.  Those thoughts - the good... and the bad, are thereby given far more credence than they're really due and in the end I become slave to them.  They become bigger than life and sometimes are responsible for creating negative behavior patterns, or give rise to poor decisions.  I am a writer.  By this I do not claim to be some self supporting novelist or some other illustrious successful prose factory.  I have no clips, I have no publishings.  Nevertheless, writing is something I do.  When I write fiction, I find a creative outlet.  When I write about my thoughts, it cages them in their own words, externalizes them on paper.  Once made into an external thing, I have tamed them.  I own them.  They become a non-issue, and in most cases I can move on, freer in my head.    Madeleine L'Engle has often said when giving talks to aspiring authors that an author must write and MUST keep a "garbage journal" into which he or she purges the thoughts of the day.  This must be something unrefined which the author would show to no one.  My own experience has taught me that she's right, and yet I never took her advice to heart to start consistently writing my "garbage" and thus purging it.  Instead, a given thought or grouping thereof builds up for months or years before I spill it into an essay of sorts lasting into 30,000 words.    The primary reason I think this is the case?  My wife.  Don't get me wrong, I love my wife too dearly to begin to try to explain here.  She has a tie to my soul which would remain despite anything.  Nevertheless, she is jealous, suspicious and nosy.  Suppose I'm wrestling with attraction for another woman?  By writing through the issue, I can again clip that desire's wings and cut it down to size, mitigating the threat to my life and marriage and go on, stronger than before.  My wife wouldn't see it that way.  If she found an essay on such dark thoughts, she'd likely not leave me (after all, it's just thoughts) but would never trust me again and it would create a rift between us.  It is the respect of my privacy and the undying belief that I could and would never do anything to hurt her that I wish she could grasp.  But she has her reasons.  She has felt the sting of infidelity and it stays with her.  Not from me, surely not.  From an old boyfriend - and I pay for his sins daily.  But this is giving that realm of my mind far more than its due.  Don't misunderstand.  I'm putting forth a worst case scenario here and my mind is not in anyway slave to, dominated by or even often a forum for thoughts of other women.  That's a rarity.  There's so much more that I don't share with anyone, so much I know others wouldn't understand.  Does anyone know who I really am?  I don't think so.  I myself am largely misunderstood and I just know, I'm better when I write my thoughts out, purging them from my mind so I can be clear-minded.  One thing differs from Madeleine L'Engle's garbage journal here in a Blog.  It's not private.  Ahh, but it is to me.  No one I know knows this is here.  You're welcome to read.  Your reading encourages and emboldens me.  Strangers listen and thus understand.  The internet's anonymity, albeit imperfect as it is is sufficient for me.  So that is why I'm here.  Thanks.

      The friggin laptop!!  I have now tried everything under the sun to make modern external devices function with this machine and they don't.  They all require drivers which I can't load because there are no drives.  The drives I want to use don't work because they require drivers which you can't load because.... you get the catch 22 here.  I've tried network cards, USB thumb drives, zip drives IR devices and nothing works.  Window 98 is antiquated.  I knew that going in.  I want no other capabilities than the most basic of internet and Word.  Don't care if it's Word 97. All I want is something on which I can write.  Is that so much to ask?    Well, nonetheless, the deal was a screaming one so I'm willing to give back some of my savings to make it happen.  There's an expansion port docking station for this laptop with a cd drive in it.  It should be what the doctor ordered because it's OLD, was designed for this specific laptop connecting through the bottom of the machine and is SUPPOSED to anyway work without drivers, even on Win 95.  We'll see.  I've ordered that thing ($48.00) and it should be here probably Tuesday.  Other than that, things are only slightly improving with my 2nd in command at work.  She resents me now because I rewrote her schedule.  She's become cold and says critical and biting things to my staff behind my back about how the schedule I wrote isn't working.  There's nothing wrong with the schedule.  She rejects it because she didn't write it.  A customer bit my head off via phone yesterday.  The Affluent rarely have any consideration for rules, laws, or the feelings of the innocent people who have to communicate them.  Affluent people often think that money can buy them anything.  They think money can buy them out of consequences.  If they don't get what they want, they complain on up the chain.  This woman wants me to lose my job because what she wants me to do I can't because it would violate a federal law.  Further, she seems to think that one of my subordinates can do it for her if I'm unwilling to do it - as if I'm making this stuff up to make her mad.  I wouldn't allow my staff to break the law either.  LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.  THIS IS FOR EVERYONE OUT THERE.  ARE YOU LISTENING?????  ANYONE HEAR THIS????  LISTEN UP!!!!!!!!  BANKING IS A HEAVILY REGULATED INDUSTRY.  MANY OF THE THINGS WE CAN AND CANT DO HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH POLICY AND A LOT TO DO WITH FEDERAL LAWS.  THERE IS NO WIGGLE ROOM WITH THE LAWS.  BANKERS ARE NOT OUT TO GET YOU!!!  BANKERS COULD CARE LESS ABOUT RUINING YOUR DAY.  IT'S NOT WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO.  WE DO NOT ENJOY MAKING YOU MAD.  WE DON'T DELIGHT IN CHARGING YOU FEES.  WE DON'T POWER TRIP ALL OVER YOU FOR OUR OWN ENJOYMENT.  WE ONLY WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY SO YOU WILL GO AWAY AND SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT US WHEN OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SURVEY PEOPLE CALL YOU.  IF WE COULD DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT, WE WOULD AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE, IF IT'S A LEGAL ISSUE, I CAN'T BREAK THE LAW FOR YOU AND COMPLAINING TO MY BOSS ONLY MAKES MATTERS WORSE!!!!!  BANKERS ARE PEOPLE TOO AND WE ARE NOT THE ELITIST FEEMONGERS AND POLICY FREAKS YOU THINK WE ARE!!!! DAMNIT!!!!!  STOP TREATING US LIKE THIS!!!!!  YOUR BANKER DOESN'T DISLIKE YOU AND HE/SHE WILL DO WHATEVER THEY CAN WITHIN THE LAW OR THE BOUNDS OF THEIR JOB/AUTHORITY TO HELP YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  whew...  glad I go that out.  I don't want to come across angry or whiny.  This woman was just needlessly mean to me, and people just are... all day long.  This is what it can be like running a bank.  Something makes you mad, go to the manager and yell at him, threaten to close all your accounts and write letters, stomp your feet and insult him.  That's how it goes.  Why do people do that?  Why do I have to be subjected to that?  Further, why do people insist on thinking that such behavior is likely to encourage me to help them.  Are you in a hurry to help a person who treats you like that?  I do the best I can all day.  It's all I can do.  I'm just one guy and I don't control the weather or the UN, I just run a bank branch.  They threaten to close their accounts if I don't remove the speed bumps in the parking lot.  SPEED BUMPS.  It's not my parking lot.  It doesn't even belong to my bank.  It belongs to the supermarket  in the shopping center and the speed bumps aren't even in front of my bank.  They're in front of a gas station and a starbucks.  Yet, they stomp their feet and yell and scream and threaten to close their accounts.  Let's get this out of the way.  Still listening?  I don't care if you close your accounts.  That statement has no leverage with me at all.  It only annoys me and makes it less likely that you will get what you want.  Close em.  I don't care.  Your accounts, no matter how much money you have will not hurt me in the slightest if you close them, and no, not even if you get your friends to close theirs too.  Just shut up about closing them and let's talk like normal people and try to come to the best solution to whatever it is that needs fixing.  Seriously.    They act like I went out there in the parking lot late one night with an asphalt truck and made the speedbumps myself, just to piss people off.  Please.  Go to your bank today.  Walk in.  Ask to talk to the manager.  (by the way, when you do that, the manager is already on edge because no one ever does that when they have something good to say or a simple question.  "Can I talk to the manager?" can be translated as "I don't care that he didn't do it or that he is just a nice guy who wants to help me, I'm gonna yell at him stomp my feet and threaten to close my accounts, ALL OF THEM, over a very, very, very crucial matter such as a mistake that resulted in a $10.00 fee which can be easily fixed and refunded in 30 seconds.")  Anyway, please, for me, just walk in to the bank.  Go to the manager and say, "Hi, my name is (insert your name here) and I just wanted to tell you that I know you have a hard job and everyone's complains come to you.  I know people often treat you badly for no good reason and I'd just like to tell you that I have nothing to complain about and I'm sure you're a pretty swell dude.  I hope you have a good day."  If you want, you can even give him/her a hug.  Please.   Please.  It's important.  I don't feel like people even think of me as a person with feelings.  Just some mindless machine out to get them.  Thanks all.  I needed that.
