         Nothin much new today. This mornin' Mom's family came over for the Saturday thing, we saw some pictures of Tara's wedding, they turned out pretty nice. Went on the computer, spent the larger portion of the afternoon setting up my ACID Planet account, getting my songs on the 'net. I'm hopin that works out well, had a reply within the first 5 minutes, so that was neat.      Read some more of my Kinky Friedman book "Greenwich Killing Time". The earliest one of the Kinky series they have at the library... sucks cuz this one's the last one I haven't read yet, so no more Kinky after this :(. Got through 2 quarters of it this afternoon, before and after calling Lindsey. She was sort of lazin around and sorta out of it today, so the talking was very minimal. Reminds me of how boring I am. My sence of humour is really turning for the worse, and it's prolyl cuz of my lack of friends. I seriosuly hope things turn around when I go back to school, or my teenage life is going to be one fuck-up of an existance. But then again, I always over-exaggerate my problems, so take that as you will.      I wanna let Lindsey go. I dunno. I say I wanna be friends, but I always feel like I'm looking for soemthing more, and that's never gonna happen, cuz she's always gonna be moving, or will be gone forever. That, plus the fact that I don't know if we're right together that way. I shouldn't let her go per se... I just need to stop thinking that thise friendship is gonna turn to something more, cuz it can't. Could just be me making excuses for today's shitty situation, so again, take it as you will.      Goin to Dad's tomorrow. Hopefully he's ina happy mood, and finds somethin for us to do. Sooner or later I'm gonna have to lose my dependancy deal, and I know it, it's just very hard to get out of. Like, I should be doing my own thing, going out, finding stuff to do on my own, but instead I depend on mom and dad to find shit for me to do, or go on the computer. Mind you, the computer is a nice home for me, I just dont have that at dad's so I haveta learn to do soemthing else with my time. Outdoors. With people. I need a job, but I just don't want to... for whatever reason, I dont know, I just dont want to. I always look to school for the source of friends and whatnot, and it's fearing me that that's not gonna happen this year... like everyone's not gonna give a flying fuck, and I'll be alone again, like I was at the end of the year, before I started clingin on Tyler Jones and his group.       I'm just confused. I don't know what I can do. I know what TO do, and I could fix my problem easily, I just dont know how to go about it for some reason... like... I dunno. Complicated shit. Point is, a solution needs to happen soon, or I'll end up ina hole at 15, and I dont want that.

         Ah, the yeehaw's somewhat sarcastic I guess. Not ina bad way, just that there's no reason to go YEEHAW and shoot a cowboy in the foot :P      Yesturday i was up till like 1:30 talking with Lindsey. It rocked so much, cuz we get along so well, but I know if I try and think of it as any more than friends, I'ma get sad again when she leaves. So although I'm gonna have fun hangin with her when we do, I gotta make sure not to get super-attached. It's all good though, as long as we're friends, I'm happy.      It's kinda surprising that we've stayed in touch over her constant moving, and our constant changes of mind. Well... MY constant changes of mind. I think for some reason we were meant for each other, not necessarily romantically, but meant to be together. I know she feels the same way in that respect, and that's super cool as well :P      Hm. Aint done much lately, as per usual. Adam came pciked us up today, and we went shirt-shopping with him. Adam's cool, and he's alot like me so we get along well. Kinda sucks that we werent closer in age, cuz there's stuff that he does (or used to do) with Shawn, that I could never get into or do. But I like hangin' with him on the weekdays, me him and Zach. Adam's a good guy.      As for the rest of today, I'm prolly gonna sit around till Mom gets home, then prolly call Lindsey later on. We were supposed to ahng out last night, but Momma didn't agree to it since it was already like 10:30 by the time Lindsey was ready to go. She's out today, so depending on when she gets back, we may or may not hang out. I'm so anxious to see how she looks now. I know she's still the same awesome girl I met almost two years ago, but seeing her for the first time in that amount of time... it's just gonna blow my mind. I love that girl to death. Love in a friendly way, like I'd do anything for her... but y'know... I wouldn't do ANYTHING for her, cuz that's not my deal. But I'll do anything easily attainable for her :P

         Ha. Woke up at 2 and I was a bit restless, so I watched some TV. Got all fidgety and tried Lindsey's sleep naked thing... that lasted a whole 5 seconds before I got a wood, and felt uncomfortable lol. Soooo I've been farting around on here. I dont feel sad exactly, so I guess I'm awake cuz of random cant-sleep-isms, and not for a reason.

         Using this'll prolly make me more apt to read past entries, rather than looking through plain notepad files. I'm bored too so, dig it. That said... off we go.     &nbsp;

         Hm, don't have much to say, cuz I've got nothing to complain about :P. Let's do some recap since the 13th shall we?  Lindsey called me on the 16th, she got my email, and she felt bad about the other night, and we're good. She rocks again :P. She's going up to BC with her mom next week (Either her or her sister, but it'll most likely be her), to check stuff out. So... dunno whats gonna happen there. I know she's moving soon, so if I'm gonna make any kind of move I need to do it soon. I wanna do something to sort of make her realise how much she means to me, and that she should like... not date anyone :P. I seriously don't want her to go... she said once she's in BC she's not coming back, and that's gonna suck so hard. If I'm still falling for her in a couple years, I'll look into college in BC lol.  Umm... really nothing much else happened. Bought Cryptic Writings the other day, and it's a helluva lot better than I thought it was gonna be. Dave's voice is awesome in it.  I've been playing guitar lately, and I just can't seem to make anything new. Wehther its laziness, or lack of inspiration I dont know. I've written three songs in the last week, and I'm doing okay with those, maybe I was meant to be a vocalist. I'd like to get ina  band, but I don't know anybody, so it makes it hard. We bought a keyboard too, and I like it. I'll haveta look into learning notes and songs on it in the near future.  Well, tonight's prolly gonna be pretty samey. I'll prolly go home, we'll sit around, I'll try making something on guitar or keyboard, it won't work, and I'll go to bed :P. Beside my boring night ahead of me, I'm in a pretty good mood. :)

         Well, it doesn't really RULE, but it wasn't bad. :P. Thought I'd have heard from lindsey by now, cuz last night I sent her a drunken email, after mom gave me like 4 vodka and juice thingers. It was for the most part drunken, but I was ina good enough mind to say what i wanted :P. Although I was, and still am, offended by what happened with Lindsey a couple nights ago, I'll get over it. I always do, and I know thats ust part of the deal with Lindsey, so I can get over it, and move on. Thing is, if those were her feelings about ME that she showed the other night, then it may not be as easy as I want it to be :P.

         Hung out with jorden today, that was cool, 'till we met up with Lindsey. Well, not immediately cuz it was cool to see her again, and we started getting along well... but then she kinda blew the night. She was complaining, then at the end, she like... jogged off away from us, to go home, and didnt even tell us she was going, then I had to chase her, and then some rfucking woman thought we were trying to rape her, and we got stopped by her... and just... Lindsey said some stuff that was just fuckin rude, and it got to me. Was something like "Well, this was a fun night", even before the old chick stopped us.

         Again, nothing much happened today. Went to the Pop Shoppe with mom, called Lindsey, only talked for a half hour which is less than usual, because I wasn't really in the mood. It kinda solidified in my mind that she doesn't wanna see me/meet up with me or whateevr, for her own reasons. That sucks, since like she says, she wont ever be coming back to Cornwall, but even though it doesnt seem fair that all our friendship has been for almost nothing, it's the way the shit rolls.

         Aye, cat woke me up about an hour ago... friggin thing wanted to play, and I can't say no to the bugger :P.      Hmmm... Jenna didn't say anything yet, so I assume she still hates me, or just would prefer to live without me, so whatever, that's done. I'm gonna try to get over her, seeing as she obviously will never come back feeling the way she did.      Was 'sposed to call Lindsey like two days ago, but I haven't, cuz I've been busy. Went to Maitland one day, to move Yvan's deck, then to the Rennick reuinion thing yesturday with my mom. I kinda like having shit to do cuz it keeps my mind off of other things, that I really dont need to be thinking about. I'll try to remember to call Linds today though... I'm hopin to set somethin up to hang out with her, cuz I wanna know if something could ever happen. Maybe kiss her or summit... I'd like to. She's been my near #1 laydee for over a year, so it'd be nice to be abe to show it.      I'ma get my guitar's re-strung today if we have time when mom gets home. That'll rock, cuz I'm gettin a likin to the sound of acoustic playing, so I can work more with that :).      Jorden IM'ed me last night, said he wanted to do something tomorrow. I don't understand what's up with that child, but I dont care. The more I know the more I'll think, so if he wants to hang out, fine :P.      I'm in a good mood. :P

         Oooh lordy lordy :P. Tonight's been a tough one to say the least... or... most... or something. Been having strong feelings about Jenna, how I miss her, and how I want her back. It's been like three weeks since I've last talked to her, and it's not normal. Longest we've ever not talkewd in the last year or so, was when she left for two weeks to Florida. I miss her so much... even just to talk to, cuz she's so great. Always thinking though, and it's not good. Thinkin' about her moving on already, finding someone else, and it's an icky feeling, and I've never gotten these so solidly before. I see her freinds list thing on her profile and its like... I've neevr been in that. Even back in the day, I was never there. Got thinkin that maybe I was never really her friend, or that she never thought of me as a friend, and that's an icky feeling too.      Sent her an email about 15 minutes ago... it could be good, maybe she'll start talking to me again on MSn or something. I just wish I kenw how she felt. I dunno if she doesn't want anything to do with me again, if she's mad at me, if she still likes me and is worried, or if she doesn't like me at all, and has moved on completely. Again, that fucking feeling, and it's fucking horrible.      It's like a shitty reversal cuz now I think i know how she felt over the last several months, when I was leading her on for my own security, and telling her I wanted to be with other girls. Fuck. If I just knew then that I was doing the most incredibly stupid thing ever, I fucking swear I wouldnt have done it. She is the best... simply. I don't want that out of my life, because she's someone you don't meet everyday, and I can fully understand that now, that I've gone through a little bit of what she went through.       It's just that feeling I get when i think about her moving on, being with someone else, being happy not to know me anymore... it's horrible. Fucking horrible. I wish she knew that. I wish she knew that i lvoe her, and that I don't wanna mess up anymore. But it's not about me all the time. If she feels that she'll be happier not talking to me anymore, I want her to not talk to me. But like... she said she loved me and like... I just don't know how she could go on, and forget about me, if she honestly felt what I felt then, and what I still feel now. I want her to be happy... but I want to be happy too. I want us to be together... but I understand maybe that's not supposed to happen right now, or ever for that matter, but it feels so fucking right.      Goddamn it, I don't even like Lindsey like that... I don't even wanna talk to Lindsey anymore. And fuck... just if I could take back what i said about me liking her, because I obviously dont, and didnt then, I'd take it back. Why I said it... I dunno. Lindsey's just been there for so long, and I thought I liked her, and I didn't want Jenna to not know... it'd be like I was screwing her over, or something. But like... I didn't, and don't, like Lindsey like that.       It's just very confusing for me, when I don't know how Jenna feels... because I don't knwo whether to move on, or if it's still possible to be friends with her. I just thought it would last forever... it felt like it was gonna last forever.

         Aye. Was listening to dad's Tony Robbins CD the other day, and he's got some damn good ikdeas and thoughts. I wasn't really looking into following any of his shit when i started listening, but when it was through, I figured I should. Basically with this, I can get in better control of my happiness and be happy more often. I'm hoping this can link to my relationships and make me better, and be able to keep friends and stuff, so that I can... be better. Dunno if it's gonna work, but I sure hope it will... then maybe I can have another shot with jenna. At this point I know I've not gotten any better, other than noticing that I fucked up, and that's not gonna help us out, so I figure if I can be somewhat successful with this, that she will be able to give me another shot. I know I don't deserve it really, and that she might be well over me by this point, but I love her, and I need her in my life.      Got a kitten the other day too, named him Doc. Very good cat, and I hope to keep him for a long while. He'll be my bud if nobody else will :P      Went to Quebec today, with Dad Zach Leo and some Roger guy. Was a fun trip, and Leo's gonna take us back up there tomorrow, and we're gonna go to the flea market in St.Zotique. Should be cool. Gonna go boating with him too, which should also be cool.      Didn't call Lindsey yesturday, and I haven't called her today either... I don't specifically know why really. I wanna hang out with her, but she always doesn't want to. And when she wants to, shit screws up. The last two-three times I've called her it always ends up silent anyhow... so I dunno what to do. I'm waiting for something to reer its head in this situation, because I honestly can't figure out what to do with this. We can't hang out, she's moving, so like... it's hard to do anything. I dont wanna get attached, plus the fact that we can hardly keep a date. So... I guess it's done. I'm not gonna call, so unless she does, I have no fuckin clue whats goin on. Dont get me wrong, I wanna call, I wanna hang out, but I can't keep calling and getting her "I dont wanna go out today" thing... it's a let-down every time, and I have nothing to say to her lately so I cant even talk on the phone with her. Actually, I might call her in a bit. I might be back.
