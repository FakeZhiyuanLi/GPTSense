       "Happiness does not depend upon getting other people's approval, it depends on getting your own."   Today is the perfect day for lounging around doing nothing.  And I am loving it.  It's been raining all day, and it's actually kind of chilly.  But I love to just lay on my bed and listen to the rain.  There is something relaxing about it.  Being all snuggled under the blankets and not having anything you have to do.  I didn't take a shower until 3:00, and I didn't do my hair, and I didn't put on any makeup.  I am going to go get some movies and just veg out.  I want to get some scary movies....but I usually end up being all freaked out.  But I am in that kind of mood today, I want to watch something scary and puzzling, a movie I will have to pay attention to.    Cruise Night was ok last night.  Nothing to write home about, but at least something to blog about.  I don't really get into cars, but I like the social aspect of it.  But I was definitely with the wrong people last night.  I could have walked around downtown all night.  But my friends went 6 blocks and decided they wanted to turn around and go back!  I just want to be around people, I want to see other people I know, that I can talk to.  But I have certain friends who, for whatever reason, don't warm up to new people.  In other words, they don't like outsiders.  But I love meeting new people.  But that's just me!  So anyway, back to last night.  There were a ton of cars to see, and the one that I really remember is the one that had the tailpipes that shot fire out.  That was pretty cool, and I don't know the correct terminology, but it was cool.  Then we went out to the same bar we go to every single weekend, and there were way too many weird people in there.  So we left!  I have decided today that I am done going out.  It's overrated, and I don't even have fun anymore.  And I will save a bunch of money too, which I should be doing anyway.  What is with these reality shows??  I am watching one right now, where three people pick three different guys to move in with the girl, or vice versus, and they live with someone they haven't met for a few days and see if they hit it off.  Now I myself think that would be a bit uncomfortable.  What if the person gets there and you totally hate each other?  What do you do then?  I just think this whole reality craze is getting a little out of control.  But whatever makes money!    Well I am going to get my movies now!  It usually takes me awhile to pick them out!

       "Love is it's own reward.  To expect something from love weakens it."   I got up early today and started cleaning.  Then when I got in the middle of it, I didn't want to do it anymore!  It really turned out to be a bigger project than I had imagined.  But now that I am done, I am glad I started it!    So anyway, I want a new name for my blog.  I don't like my current name.  I think Shelly is the only one who would know what the Heaven's Ta Betsy is, so anyone have any suggestions?  If so, post some comments.  I want something clever.....and cute.    Tonight our town is having Cruise Night!  All of Streator's finest are out already.  Everytime there is something going on all the weirdos come out!  It's like a full moon or something!  But it's a good time.  We sit out on the street and have some drinks and watch all the cars go by.  Good times!  It's kind of cool to see all the people out, well the normal people anyway.  I love to people watch!    Ok, now I know I had mentioned understanding men in a previous blog, but now I am starting to realize why men don't understand women as well.  Last night I watched one of my friends follow her ex-boyfriend around like a lost puppy.  I was embarrassed for her.  I don't think she realized how crazy she looked.  We were at this bar, and she followed him from one end to the other 3 times.  He told her to just leave him alone, and she wouldn't!  I didn't know what to do.  I told her I was leaving, and if she wanted a ride she better let it go.  So she got in my car and just started crying and yelling and carrying on.  I couldn't get a word in at all!  She is nuts though!  I don't understand why someone would subject themselves to that.  But she is one of those insecure girls who has to have a boyfriend or else she is nothing!  Some women, and I mean "some" women are crazy!  Not all women!  Just some women.  But it amazes me how someone else can affect you like that.  Can make you lose all rationale.  Of course it's easy for me to say that, because I am not in the situation, but I would never act like that.  I have some dignity!  It's amazing what you can see in other people's situations, and how easy it is to make judgements.  I think I might be rambling on.  Hope I didn't lose anyone!     Anyway, I have to go get ready for cruise night!  Whoo hoo!  Good times!  And remember, if you have any suggestions for a new name for my blog, feel free to post a comment.  The best title will win $10,000......haha no, not really!

       "Always take care of yourself, then you will be able to take care of others."   I got this super ambitious urge to get organized today.  I haven't actually done it yet, but I have started to prepare.  I bought an organizer, and this folder dealy, and some new clothes.  Well the new clothes weren't really needed, but they were on sale!  I couldn't resist.  So anyway, I really want to go through all my stuff and just start getting rid of stuff!  I am somewhat of a packrat, and I keep really dumb things!  I have crap from highschool that no normal human being would ever keep!  And you don't even want to know about the clothes, and the shoes, that I have.  I have to stop!  And it makes me sick to look in my closet and see things that I have only worn once.  And to know what I spend on clothes, ugh I could throw up!  I hope I am finally realizing that I am going to have to make sacrifices if I want to move, and get things paid off.  It's hard though.  When I see something I want I will buy it.  I mean I have certain limits, but if I want it bad enough, I will spend the money!  Maybe I need a financial advisor...or a budget.  I was at Target today(getting my organizational supplies) and I saw this book of spells.  It was this cute little book, and it had all these spells, for getting money, getting over an ex-lover, all these crazy things.  I was tempted for a minute to buy it, but then I remembered....I don't believe in that stuff, and it was $15.00 for this little tiny book.    So it's Labor Day weekend....I should be playing in a softball tourney this weekend, but we didn't get our butts in gear in time.  Oh well!  This weekend is also the two year anniversary of my car accident!  It's hard to believe it was two years ago.  It feels like it just happened.  That was the craziest day of my life, and yes I know it's cheesy to say "anniversary", but that's what it is really.  Everytime I drive through that intersection I remember that day!  And Shelly, I will have you know that I have been wearing my seatbelt everytime I get in the car now!  I swear!  It's habit now.    I need to start learning how to understand men.  They say they will never understand women, but I think they are just as complicated as we are.  I wish I could be in the head of a guy for just one day.  I guess I just wish I knew if it was something I said or did.  You know when a guy says he will call you and then he doesn't?  Why?  Why do they do that?  If you don't want to call me then don't say you will!  Men always think they have to say what we want to hear.  Well not me. I want to hear what a guy is thinking.  Don't say things just to pacify me!  I hate that!  I am a pretty honest, straightforward person, and I want someone to be the same way with me!  Is that too much to ask?  Does anyone have some insight for me?  I would love some!  Ok, well I am going to get organized now!!

       "The only failure is in no longer trying."   I had a couple places from the Chicago area call me about my resume.  So now I am thinking, Hmmm, maybe I should just stay around here.  I mean I would really love to move to California, but I don't know that I am capable of making that move.  I guess I am mostly scared of being lonely!  I know Shelly will be there, but we are obviously not going to spend all our time together.  Oh, I just don't know anymore!  What to do, what to do!!  Can someone just tell me what to do?  No, I guess not.  So I have been having this recurring dream, and it's kind of weirding me out.  I am dreaming about a person I haven't seen in a really long time.  And I don't like the fact that I am dreaming about him.  And I'm sure it means nothing, but I hate that I am thinking about him now, because he doesn't deserve my thought!  Although sometimes when I think about him it brings back a lot of good times, and I almost wish I could go back to those days.  But they are in the past, and I am looking to the future!  So, no more dreams....hopefully!  I am off work for the next 4 days, and I couldn't be happier.  And for some reason I considered going in tomorrow, because I don't have anything planned.  I was just having a bad week, and wanted it to be over a day sooner.  Who knows, maybe I will still go in.  Call me crazy!!

       "Go confidently in the direction of your dreams.  Live the life you have imagined."   YAY!!!  Cory has joined the blogging community!!!  I need to see some new pictures of Maddy!  I can't believe she is 4 months already!  Oh, they grow so fast.   And Amy, that was the most disgusting thing I have heard in a long time!!  Stick with the Seamonkeys!  And Shelly!  I told you what dreaming about tires means.    I have a nice 4 day weekend coming up....I am sooooo excited!    Is it possible to pull a muscle while you are sleeping?  Because this morning I woke up and my left leg hurts, like I pulled a hamstring or something.  It hurts right behind my knee.  I have no idea why, it didn't hurt when I went to bed.  I wish I could say I hurt myself in bed by NOT sleeping!!  HEHE!!    Alright, well I am going out tonight, because tomorrow is Friday for me!  And I just need a drink!  So peace out!

      " Write down your unhappiness in a journal and save it for a moment when you feel strong enough to confront it"   I swear today should be Friday.  It has been the longest week already, and it's only Tuesday.  I don't think I am going to make it through the week, at least not without heavy sedation anyway.  I have been so mentally exhausted lately.  Hello, I work in an office supply joint.  Why do I have to get so upset about work!  It's not friggin brain surgery!  People act like they will die if they don't get their orders the next day.  Shut up Kristi!  I am going to talk about something else.  So Shelly is dreaming about midgets!  I thought it would mean something really weird, but it doesn't.  It means a new acquaintance will develop into a valued friendship.  So does that mean she is going to meet a midget and become good friends with him or her.  Actually to be PC, they are called little people.  I don't think they like to be called midgets, but I don't know any personally, so I can't really say.  Let me know Shell!  HAHA!!  The power kept going out at work today....it was weird.  I thought we were going to have another "Blackout 2003"  But of course the computers were still working, and the phones!  Lucky us!    I really need to go have a massage.  I wonder what a 3 hour massage would cost.  Hmmmm, I am going to look into that.    I went to Subway tonight, and it reminded me of something.  My friend's brother met Jared from Subway....and he said he isn't  that   skinny.  HAHA!  How funny would that be?  But if you think about it, that would be an expensive diet.  And it seems like every time I go to Subway, they have to do a cash drop when I get to the register.  I have the worst timing.  But the girl was really fast this time.  Usually I am standing there for 10 minutes waiting.  Oh well!  It happens!

       "Happiness is along the path that offers you the chance to find yourself."   Today has not been a good day.  I really feel like I could jump right out of my skin.  I just want to go somewhere and be totally alone, and just think.  I have so many thoughts running through my head right now, and I can't sort any of them out.  I just realized today that I absolutely hate my job, and I am tired of going into that place every day.  But yet I worry about things, and try to get things done, when supervisors sit on the phone on a personal call.  I am just tired of carrying everything on my shoulders, but I want to do a good job.  Well I am tired of being the model employee.  I am tired of volunteering to cover everyone  else, and I am tired of worrying about things that no one else gives a shit about.     I don't even think I have anything else to say right now.  I don't want to go on and on about all this negative stuff.  I am going for a walk to clear my head.

      I forgot to mention earlier what a stupid thing I did last night.  Let me just set the scene.  For 8 months the stoplights in town have been out for repair.  So first they were all blinking, and you just treated it as a four way stop.  Once they had all the old light out, they just had makeshift stopsigns up.  Then they got the new lights up but they were still blinking.  So needless to say I got used to stopping and going.  They are fixed now.  But last night I was driving along, had a few drinks, and totally was thinking about something else. I mean I was deep in thought about something, and I stopped, and I went....right through a red light.  And as soon as I did it, I said out loud, "Oh f@&%!!!  I just went through a red light."  Then I immediately checked all my mirrors for red flashing lights!  Thank the good good Lord there wasn't a cop anywhere! I would have been screwed!  So then I took some jacked up way home because I was paranoid.  But then I was thinking about these things they have on top of the lights, that could very likely be cameras.  I don't really know, but I guess when I get a ticket in the mail, I will know.  I am soooo dumb!!!!  I went to the grocery store tonight.  I am in one of those moods.  I saw someone I know, but I hung back until they got in the store.  I just didn't feel like talking at all.  That's why I go to the grocery store at 9:00 on a Sunday night, less people.  I don't know why, but I just feel kind of anti social today.  I think it will be an early night tonight.  I am tired.  Even though all I did was sleep this weekend.  I was in bed by midnight both nights this weekend, and I slept until almost noon both days!  Sorry Shell!  I have no trouble sleeping.  I even had a nap both days!  Oh well, that's what weekends are for right?

       "The best medicines in life can be found in a faithful friend or a happy moment."   First question!  How old is Casey Kasem these days?  I mean how long has he been around?    So I am supposed to go fishing today.  And the only reason I am going is because my friend is having a hard time right now, and she wants to go.  Now I can't really imagine 4 girls wanting to go fishing, but I guess that's what we are going to do.  But I made Jenny promise to bait my hook, because this girl does not touch worms.  Yeah I will admit that I can be somewhat of a girly girl.  What of it?  I am watching this new show on Comedy Central, Reno 911.  It is hilarious.  When I saw the previews for it I thought it looked really dumb, but now that I am watching it, it's pretty funny!

       "The most difficult step of any journey is the first."   Dreams are so weird!!  I had the longest puzzle dream last night.  It went from one thing to another, and I don't think I could remember all of it if I tried.  But I had this huge tattoo in this dream, so I looked it up in my little dream book.  I still have no idea what it means.  The book says this.  "To be tattooed means you deeply and unchangeably wish to sacrifice higher knowledge and better understanding to a stamp that is the brand of an influence alien to you."  WHAT???  I thought it just meant I wanted another tattoo.  Maybe I should get back into psychology, then I can analyze my own dreams.    OK, so I am moving, and I am definite about that.  But the quote I posted above is soooo true.  It's hard to even know where to start.  I guess my first step is to get my resume out there.  Price out the u-hauls!  I do not want to drive that big thing!  The apartment is all taken care of!  Thank you Shelly!  So I need to get my butt in gear.   Oh I got this thing in the mail today from CitiBank!  It said I am preapproved for a $20,000 home loan, secured by my property at 113 W 1st St.  Ok, hey mom and dad, I am using your house to get a $20,000 loan.  What kind of house can I buy for $20,000?  Why do they have my name, and why are they sending me this shit?  There's one more check on my credit report!  I need to get a new copy of my report.  I am curious to see how many times it has been checked.   That's one thing I am a freak about.  I will not let my credit go bad!    Hey Shell!!!  I have an answer to your insomnia problem.  Just drink a bottle of wine before you go to bed!  That will knock you out!    The sense of smell is really an amazing thing, the way it can instantly bring back a memory.  Smells can remind me of an ex-boyfriend or my childhood.   One day I smelled this peach candle and it totally reminded me of this medicine I had to take when I was little.  I loved the taste of it.  Smell can just take you way back to a moment you thought you had forgotten.  I love it.

       "Don't worry about your future, it can only arrive one day at a time."   AARRRRGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!   @#$@  I am so pissed off today!!!!  Well it carries over from last night, but I am still pissed today.  Sometimes I think I should go get my blood pressure checked!   So let me tell you about my night last night.  I went out and had a few drinks, and have realized that some men have absolutely no respect for anyone, let alone women.  This guy who is sort of my friend, sat next to a guy who is NOT my friend, and never will be, and talked about my boobs.  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!  What assholes!  Ya know there is more to me than my chest!  And I get so tired of people looking at them, and talking about them.  What the hell??!!  Why do they think they have the right to just sit there and blatantly stare at my chest?  And then degrade me by talking about them and asking me to show them?  And then this guy said something really ignorant because I told them no and to shut up.  PIGS!!!!!!  I just want to say to them,"What if someone was treating your sister or your mom this way?"    - Ok, so here come my ramblings!  First of all, I was craving a bologna sandwich with Doritos on it.  It is soooo good!  So stop   turning up your nose!    - Meetings at work are so long and boring, and by the time they are over I want to shoot myself.  And all they consist of are the old ladies bitching and griping, because they aren't happy unless they are.  And they love to hear themselves talk.....alot.....about nothing!  - This afternoon I was trying to eavesdrop on two people talking because they were whispering and obviously gossiping.  And I could make out a few words, but then this girl who sits in the next aisle started typing all fast with her fake nails, and that's all I could hear.  The clickety click of her nails on the keyboard!!!!  Oh I was pissed!  I was just starting to be able to hear bits and pieces!  - Some guy was riding my ass on the way home from work today!  All I could see in my side mirror was him.  I was getting MAD!!  He didn't have the balls to pass me so he just had his head up my ass the whole way home!  People suck today!  I need to go take a nap!  I am tired and grumpy!!!!  I'm Outtie!!!

       "I do not regret the things I did, but those I did not do."    I am a control freak!!  I just realized this today.  I used to just think I was a little anal retentive, but now I realize that I am a full blown control freak!  I can't even let people help me at work because I want to do it my way and make sure it gets done right.  I told my friends at work that I could never be a teacher.  I would probably grab the crayons out of their little hands, and say,"Let me do it."  I better work on this.    I had a woman I work with tell me I am intimidating today.  Now I don't know if she is nicely calling me a bitch or what, but I couldn't believe it.  I am just me, I don't ever think  people would be intimidated by me.  I told her I am just shy!  Yeah, I am!!  When I first meet someone I don't say a whole lot.  I have to reveal my true self slowly....I don't want to scare people.    It is so friggin hot today!  This humidity has got to go!  It's supposed to rain tonight, so hopefully that will alleviate some of this.  I can't take much more.  So I am trying to add links to my Blog, but I have no idea how to do it.  I keep reading the same instructions over and over, and I just don't get it.  I am more of a hands on person, so I was trying to just mess with it.  No clue.  I tried all sorts of different things!  I am computer illiterate.  But I will keep trying!  There will be links!  Today is L.I.T!!!!  Long Island Thursday!  I did not have a drink last night, and I need one.  So tonight...I am a friggin rockstar!!  I am going out and I am going to have a few drinks and not think about anything!  I have been worrying about so much crap I think I may be developing an ulcer.  Milk hurts my stomach!!!  That's not right!  Isn't milk supposed to soothe your stomach...or something?  I don't know!  But my stomach hurts a lot!  That's all I know.  I'm no doctor!  I eat a lot of TUMS though!  Maybe the Long Islands will soothe them!!  HAHA!!!!

       "Cry if you feel the need.  A good cry can often clear the air."   So what if you cry every day?  Think there might be a hormonal imbalance.  I think I have too much estrogen running through my veins!  I cry at commercials these days!  No, not really, but geez, what the hell?    Today was crazy at work!  We are down 1 person, and then 2 other people were out.  I was running around like a chicken with it's head cut off.  But I kind of liked it.  I like the pressure of the deadlines, and cutoffs, and all that busy work.  Makes the day fly by.  Although, when I stopped to take a minute, I almost felt overwhelmed.  Note to self...Don't stop til the work is done.  But I have to say I could have gotten a lot more done, if people would just leave me alone.  I don't know if these reps think they need to explain every little thing to me or what.  I am a pretty smart girl, I can figure it out.  Now get the hell out of here!  ( I hope I didn't give this address to anybody I work with).   I need a drink!!!  Oooh tonight is $1 Vodka and Lemonades!!!!  WHOOOHOOOO!!!!  I am a friggin rockstar!!    Shelly just confirmed my worst fear.  I have been going to the same hairstylist for the last 5 years or so.  And I completley trust her, and she is also a friend.  So I am worried about who is going to cut my hair when I move to California.  Just like shopping, I have an obsession with getting my hair done.   If I am bored on a Saturday I will go get highlights or get it cut or something.  Guess I will have to stop doing that.  Maybe I will save some money then.  But Shell had to go to some random hair stylist!  Hopefully she will have it all scoped out before I get there.    I did not want to get up this morning!  I hate getting up.  I just want to rollover and go back to sleep!  I usually say at least one obscenity before getting out of bed.  Grab my stupid robe, and hit the shower!  And half the time I am just staning there with my eyes closed.  And then I scramble around trying to find something to wear, and then I have to iron it.  Needless to say, I am usually 3 - 5 minutes late for work every morning.  Good thing I work in such a laid back atmosphere.  I do stay and make it up though!  So it's ok!    Well I don't have anything else to say, surprise surprise!

      I just got back from my walk, and on my way home I passed this girl.  She was carrying a baby, probably 2-4 months old.  The girl could not have been more than 15 or 16 years old, if that.  And I heard the little girl who was walking next to her ask her if the baby's father had seen her yet.  My heart broke.  Here I am worrying about taking care of myself, and she has to take care of a baby, when she is not even done growing up yet herself.  Now I am not saying it's not her own fault, because obviously it is.  But you have wonder what kind of upbringing they had, if they were educated about this type of thing, and how to prevent it.  I just feel bad for these girls and their babies.  But everytime I see it, it reminds me of why I want to do things the right way.  So be careful girls!!    Ok, so I have talked about things I dislike, so now I am going to tell you the things I love:    1.)  Long walks (helps me clear my head)   2.)  Spooning  (would love to do that right now)   3.)  Walking barefoot in the grass.   4.)  Shopping   5.)  Italian Food   6.)  Puppies (that's a little cliche, but I really do)   7.)  Getting new pictures of me and my friends after a party.   8.)  Laying on the beach  (will be doing that a lot more in the very near future)   9.)  Listening to a new CD 10.)  Sleeping in.  There are a ton more, but that's all I have time to list right now.

        "Sometimes problems have to be faced from different angles in order to find solutions."    AMEN!!!  Got this e-mail from my sister-in-law, and it made me cry!  I am going to post it here....just because it's so true, and she always makes me feel good about my decisions!  But she also made me see things in a little different perspective, which I really needed.  I hate to keep going on and on about the same things, but this is a huge thing that I am doing.  And I want to know that people support me.  And I am realizing that they do.     Kristi,   Hey! I just finally sat down to the computer for the first time in about 5 days-so I just got your message.  I think you have a great handle on the whole situation. I see that Chuck read your note & I am so glad, because I have told him how important it is to support you on this.   I mean, the worst thing that could happen is that you tried something and it wasnt for you and you have the peace of knowing YOU tried it and your not wondering what might have been.   The BEST thing that could happen, is that you love it and your happy. WOW!! What a concept!   This might be a different conversation if it wasnt YOU. But you are bright and smart - that is two different things- and you have had a strong family upbringing. You have strong values and common sense. You've got the ability to use your wings.    Your family loves you and certainly don't want you to get hurt in any possible way.  I'm speaking as a Mom now-its hard for all of them to realize your age.  And obviously, you are a huge part of your Moms life, so if you're not there, the way she spends her time and energy will be a lot different.  That is probably very scary for her. You kind of bear the burden of being the last one in the house, her job duties as Mom now will be much different . . . you get the picture.  But that is not your responsibility.  You Mom is also smart and is more comfortable in her current job description. All pretty natural.  Children are meant to grow up, develop their wings and leave the nest.  That's the plan.  Your folks will miss you.  They'll be ok. Look at all they have been through.  They really are strong people.   So, I didn't mean to get this preachy, but I totally believe in exploring your dreams.  If I wasn't, I would never have met your brother and have a truly great relationship, with someone that wants to try things too!  I wouldn't have this family.  We wouldn't be considering moving to Atlanta or wherever.  You have to dream and be able to weigh out the costs and the risks and definitely able to face the worst possible scenario.   The great thing is, nobody's going to die because of this decision.   People get scared, selfish and jeolous, all of the sudden everyone else is thinking "What's this mean to me . . . ?"  So just remember.  No risk, no gain.  Love ya, keep me posted! Nancy.     I love my family!  They are absolutely the most important thing in the world to me!  I would not be the person I am today if it weren't for them.  I owe my strength to my mom, and my compassion to my dad.  So glad my dad made me go to church when I was younger.  My mom stopped going a long time ago, and I have kind of figured out why.  But I think I went long enough to figure out what it's  supposed  to be about.   Some people make a mockery of themselves.  I stopped going because I wasn't living the life I should have been.  So why go sit in church every Sunday?  That doesn't change the things you did all week long.  But now that I am older and wiser, I understand what I need to do.  I have a lot of things I need to change about myself.  But we won't go into all that right now.

      I was just IMing with Shelly, and I felt the need to write some more.  I promise this will be my last blog tonight.  I have been listening to my new CD, Switchfoot, over and over.  I love it.  Everything they sing provokes some sort of thougt to my head.  There is this line they sing, "My fears have worn me out."  And I just think, "That is so true", how many times have my fears held me down?  How many times have I not gone after something because I was scared?  A LOT!!!  Even if it was something little, like calling a guy, or asking a guy out!  It's so stupid.  I am going to start going after the things I want.  Life is way too short.  I don't want to be 80 years old, sitting on my back porch with 12 cats saying,"I should have done this, or I should have done that."    So last week we had to clean our desks and straighten up everthing around the center because our CEO was going to be there today.  And we had to dress up in "business attire", no khakis or anything like that.  We got countless e-mails reminding us that these people would be there today.  I mean they acted like there was going to be a celebrity in the house!  He never even came down to our department.  Good thing I didn't clean anyway!  Ya know I work at my desk.  I am not going to try and make it look spotless.  What's he going to do, write me up.  I was hoping he would come down and see my seamonkeys sitting there.  How professional would that have looked?  HAHA!!!!  By the way, when I left on Friday, the Grand Pooba was mounting another one, and when I got in this morning they were still at it.  Unless maybe it was a different one, manwhore!!!  But anyway, I had a bunch of little babies in the tank today!  One of these days, I am going to come in and they are going to be hanging out of the tank.  They'll be turning on my computer and getting me coffee!

      One of my favorite movies is on.  Saving Silverman!  Love it!  It's hilarious.  So I feel a little better right now.  I had a little nap.  Work was good today.  I came in to find a card on my desk.  I had no clue what it could be for, my b-day was 3 weeks ago.  So I opened it up and it was from my supervisor.  She had given it to me just to tell me thanks for all that I do, and all my hard work!  So then I looked to see if everyone got one.  But I was the only one.  I felt really good about it.  It's nice when people notice how hard you work.  My job isn't saving lives or anything, but I still take pride in the work I do.  I think I would take pride in my work even if I worked at McDonald's.  It's all about customer service!    Speaking of Customer Service, I went to Home Depot to return some things for my Mom.  The girl who returned them was so dumb.  She was asking me which items they were on the receipt and how much they were.  I wanted to say,"Do you see me wearing an orange Home Depot smock?"  "You are the one holding the receipt and the item."  Then when I needed to sign the return slip, she asked me if the return was for my daughter....are you kidding me?  Do I look old enough to have a daugther who would be redoing a kitchen???  NO, I DON"T!!!!  Here are some more of my pet peeves,(I have a lot).... 1.)  When people get too close to you in line, and keep bumping into you. (I had this happen today at Subway.  Don't you think if you bumped someone once, you would back off a little?  Nope, not this guy.  He hit my arm 3 times!) 2.)  When people stop their car completely to turn.  Not across traffic or anything.  They just stop and turn. (And I am sitting behind them yelling, "Turn it buddy!!!!") 3.)  When someone calls you and then they sit there not saying a word.  (I want to say, "Hello, you called me, now start talking!")

       "If you ever expect to be loved, you must reveal who you are."   I feel trapped today!  I feel like there are things I want to do, but I can't.  It's like my feet are cemented down.  I almost feel sick trying to figure out the right thing to do.  I am so back and forth about everything.  But my biggest worry all the time is money.  But I will get by somehow, that's what people do.  I don't want to just get by though.  I don't even know what I am really saying right now, what I am thinking.  I really just want to lay down and go to sleep right now.  I find it amazing how much impact other people have on my mood.  I try so hard not to let other people affect me negatively, but sometimes I just can't help it.  I sometimes tend to dwell on things, overthink things, and hold grudges.  I really need to work on all of those things.    If you read yesterday's entry you were probably thinking ,"Duh Kristi, there is no September 31."  I figured that out today!  So my goal date is September 30.  Just wanted to clear that up.  I am out of here!  I don't really even feel like doing this right now.

        "We are all unique, but carry the same burdens of self doubt, fear, anger, and grief."    I think I may have decided on a day to move.  I am thinking September 31. I might just take out a loan to cover moving expenses and to cover me the first couple months I am there.  I don't want to be killing myself trying to catch up.  Ya never know, it may take longer than I think to find a job.  What's a little more debt?  Well I went to Target again today.  I had good intentions though.  I was just going to return a couple things, and I wasn't going to buy anything.  But I did spend less than I returned....so that's good right?  Kelli called me and wanted me to go with her, and I was still sleeping and was going to tell her no.  But then I thought to myself, that when I call people to do things with me, I really hate it when they say no.  I have a friend who never wants to go anywhere.  So I know how it is.   I have found myself thinking, "How would  I  feel in that situation?"  I am really trying to live my life that way.   I am not always compliant, but I do try.    One of the best shows on TV is Cops!!!  I love it.  You see all walks of life on that show.....well mostly one walk of life.  Mostly white trash being busted for drugs.  But the drugs aren't theirs of course!!!  But it's good stuff to watch!

      Went to Target this afternoon.  One of my favorite places in the world.  But anyway, I have come to two realizations.  I cannot get out of that store with out spending at least $100.00.  And I love ugly shoes.  It's like when you see an ugly dog.  It's so ugly it's cute.   Driving to Target about sent me over the edge.  I have the worst road rage ever.  I mean I am in my car yelling and screaming obscenities at people.  It makes me feel better even though they can't hear me telling them how stupid they are!    I have had this song in my head for the last couple days, and I haven't even heard it anywhere.  Remember "I Got My Mind Set On You"?  It's gonna take money...a whole lot of spending money.....it's gonna take plenty of money..mmmmhhmmm to do it right!!!  And there were two videos for it.  One where George Harris is sitting in the chair and all the animals on the wall are singing and stuff.  And the other one was the guy trying to get the ballerina out of one of those machines with all the stuffed animals, and the crane.  I used to love both those videos!  I know, I am a dork!  But who cares!  Now you are going to really think I am a dork, because I seriously had this thought today.  And I actually laughed out loud at myself.  I was driving home from Target and I drove past this herd of cattle.  And I actually thought, "If I gave them some beef, would they know what they were eating??"  And I am laughing right now, because I can't believe I am typing this.  But it's a half hour drive from Target, so I had to do something to amuse myself.   You never know, your kids might ask you that someday!    Alright, I am out of here, before you guys think I am   really  crazy!!

       "Do not worry about finding love.  Love will find you when the time is right."   Sometimes I think I am a little behind in my life.  A lot of people my age are getting married and having kids and doing all these grown up things!  But then I take a look around and realize that you have to be with that person for the rest of your life.  And I am only 25, so what's the hurry!  My parents have been married since they were 19 and 20.  And now that they are in their 60s, they are not so much in love.  Don't get me wrong, they love each other.  I know they do, but they are just getting older and they are set in their ways, and they can tend to be grumpy.  But I want my marriage to be different!  I want my marriage to get better all the time.  Sometimes I think I have this fairy tale dream of a marriage.  But that's what I want.  I want to be so in love with the person I marry, that I can't see straight.  I want to be dying to see them when I am away from them.  I want him to think I am the most beautiful woman in the world.  I want him to get all my jokes, and give it right back to me.  I want surprises, romance, and excitement.  Long weekends away. I want to know it's right.  So that's why I am in no hurry to get out there and get married.  I believe I will someday, and I am going to do it right the first time.  I know you hear me girls!  You all know what I am saying!  I'm done!   Played softball last night!  It was an "all star" game.  So it was a bunch of people from different teams playing against each other.  It was fun.  But I am all softballed out!  My legs have been sore for a week.  Between playing 3 games last Saturday, walking 3 miles a day, and playing 2 games last night. I have pretty much come to the conclusion, I am so out of shape!!!  Or I am jus getting old!  I don't know!    Shelly got me hooked on this new CD.  Switchfoot.  I highly recommend checking it out.  Thanks Shelly!  I found it.    Has anyone else noticed how much I use exclamation points?  I have noticed that.  It reminds me of that Seinfeld episode when Elaine is talking about exclamation points.  Anyway, I am going boating today so I am out of here!

      Thought to ponder!   "This is your life.  Are you who you want to be?"    I would have to say, Yes, sometimes!  But today, I did not like who I am.  I cried on the way to work this morning.  I hate that I did, but for some reason, I just started crying.  And I know it's a woman's perogative to cry whenever she wants but I feel so out of control when that happens to me.  I guess it comes down to the fact that I am not happy with where I am right now.  Physically and mentally.  BUT I am the only one who can change that, so I should stop bitching about it, and do something about it.  I just feel like there is so much out there!  So much more that I want to be.  I think I am capable of a lot, but something is holding me back.   I just can't figure it out.  I know exactly what I want, but maybe sometimes I think I don't deserve it.  I really try to be a good person, I try to be honest and real with people.  Sometimes I am a little too real, but that's just who I am.    So basically I HAVE to go to California!  I need to see what's there.  I think what I might be waiting for is my mom to just tell me that she supports me and wants me to do whatever will make me happy.  But I don't know if she is going to do that.  But I can't stay here for other people.  I have to do something for me, I have to make myself happy.  So that's what I am going to do.    I have to tell you all about my 4 year old niece!  She is the funniest kid I know.  She already has this strong personality, and she kind of reminds me of myself.  Myself now, not at age 4.  But last night she wanted to go outside, and she wanted to ride this little 3 wheeler thing.  So I got it out for her, and then she decided she wanted to play with this ball.  So when we are going in the house, I told her to put the 3 wheeler thing away, and she asks me if I am going to put it away.  I tell her no because she got it out, and she said, with a straight face, "YOU carried it out here."  She's four, and she has an answer for everything.  So she has already found a loop hole in putting toys away.  She can play with them, but as long as she doesn't actually carry them out of the garage, she doesn't have to put it away.   She's funny.

      Ok, people.  Want to introduce a new feature.  I am going to be posting a quote of the day on here every day from here on out.  Now they might be stupid quotes that I saw somewhere, or they might be inspirational quotes.  You just never know with me!!!  Here is the first one....  "I may look nice, but I wear leather underwear!!"  It is a very, very humid day in Illinois today.  It's so bad you can see the humidity just hanging in the air.  It hits you like a brick wall!  And you can feel it hitting your skin.  And it does nothing for your hair either.  See my hair is naturally curly...and I have for most of my life straightened it.  But whenever it was humid like this my hair would get all wavy.  Then when I finally gave in, and started wearing it curly, the humidity would make it flat and straight.  So now what am I supposed to do??

      I have a lot to report today!  First of all working with a hangover sucks!  I mean do I think  I am still 21 years old or what??  I can't be doing this crap!  And I wasn't even out that late.  I was home by 12:30.  Let me tell you what I drank last night.  5 Miller Lite, 3 JagerBombs, 2 Vodka/Lemonades.  Now have you ever heard the saying "Beer before liquor, never been sicker.  Liquor before beer, in the clear"?  It's true!  I ended the night with the vodka and lemonade, and I felt like I could throw up all morning.    So I went to Wendy's for lunch, because nothing is better for a hangover than some greasy fast food.  Now let me just tell you my pet peeve about Wendy's.  I am in the drive thru and I am giving my order, and she interrupts me to ask if I would like to Biggie Size it.  Now anyone who knows me knows that I do not like to be interrupted.  It's rude!  So anyway, I tell her, "Sure, go ahead and Biggie Size it",  because I want that gallon size Iced Tea.  So I get up to the window, and she hands me a regular iced tea.  So I tell her it was supposed to be the Biggie.  She says well you weren't charged for it, and I say yes I was.  So the point of my story is, they are all about getting you to Biggie Size it, and I finally give in and say yes, and then they don't Biggie size it!  UGH!!!!!  This is why these people work at Wendy's!  Sorry!  You are all probably thinking, "Kristi Would ya shut up!  But you don't understand.  Their speaker is so damn loud, and then you are trying to place your order, and they are interrupting you!  It's annoying!  I was sitting in my cubicle this morning, which I like to call my office, and I thought I heard this woman say," I got up at 3:00 a.m. for a B.M.  Now I don't know if she actually said that, or I was still drunk, but I could swear that's what I heard.

      I was just reading Shelly's blog and I found out that I have slept in a bed that a man died in.  I am not too sure how I feel about that.  We used to play a joke on people all the time in highschool.  There was this certain chair that people would sit in.  We would tell them that Shelly's grandpa died in that chair and then watch them fly out of it.  Then I find out that I was lying in a bed that someone actually did die in.  Great!  Oh well!    And can I just say that I am sooooooo tired of road construction?    I know I talk about work a lot, but it is where I spend most of my time.  And I would like to say that I work with a bunch of children who can't follow directions!  That is all I am saying today, because I am going to try to not think about work anymore.  What I have been thinking about constantly is moving to California!  It's the biggest, scariest decision I have ever been faced with.  I have been going over the pros and cons in my head.  The pros definitely outweigh the cons.  But there is one con that weighs heavily on my mind and my heart.  That's leaving my family!  I try to tell myself that it will be fine.  I am going to move away and make a life of my own.  And my family will be happy for me.  But I am going to miss the days when we are all haning out together playing cards, sitting outside while my nephews and nieces play.  But I know that I can't just stay here for that.  I can't wait around for things to happen to me.  I need to make them happen.  So that's why I have to go.  I need to do something for myself.  If I think this might make me the slightest bit happy, I need to try it!  So all I need to do is decide when I am going to go.  I just worry about money soooo much!  But I can't let that keep me here.  I'm not happy here.  So I am going to take the big leap!  And like I have been saying all along, I can always come back.

      Ya know, trust is such a fragile thing, and it gets broken alot.  When does it get to the point where it can't be fixed anymore??  I mean how many chances should a person get?  Only one seems harsh, but 5 or 6?  How do you know where to draw the line?  I guess you just need to go with your gut huh?  I would say trust is one of the most important things in the world.  I mean it comes up pretty much every day.  Do you ever stop to think how often someone breaks your trust?  Even if it's just some silly rumor that is going around the office.  You tell someone, and then of course you end the conversation with,"Don't tell anyone I told you."  That person tells someone and then you feel betrayed.  And how often do you BREAK someone's trust?  It's such a huge thing, but it's such a little thing too!  It can be broken so easily, and so hard to fix.    So anyway, I was completely swamped at work!  And if one more person would have come to my desk, I think I may have killed them.  Why do people think I am there just to help them.  I couldn't possibly have had any of my own work to do!  I must have looked bored or something.  Maybe if some of these people would learn to use that big computer looking thing on their desk, they might not need to come to me.    I am feeling a little rebellious these last few days, and I am wanting to go get another tattoo!  But I have no idea what to get.  That's the hardest part about it.  Deciding what to get, where to put it, and who to go to.  The needle bouncing up and down on your skin is nothing!    Ok, well I am done for now.  Don't really have much else to say!!!  Check ya later!!  HAHA!!!

      I want to start out by saying,"Mondays suck".  Ok, got that out of my system.  That's all I really have to say, so I wanted to put some quotes on here.  These are quotes that inspire me, or make me sit back and think, "hmmm, that's so true!"  So here we go!  "No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry."  "Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile."  "May today there be peace within you.  May you trust God that you are exactly where you are meant to        be."   Here are a couple tests to tell whether or not you are ready for kids. TOY TEST Obtain a 55 gallon box of Legos (or you may substitute roofing tacks).  Have a friend spread them all over the house.  Put on a blindfold.  Try to walk to the bathroom or kitchen.  DO NOT scream because this would wake a child at night.  DRESSING TEST Obtain one large, unhappy, live octopus.  Stuff into a small net bag, making sure that all the arms stay inside.  GROCERY STORE TEST Borrow one or two small animals (goats are best) and takethem with you as you shop.  Always keep them in sight and pay for anything they eat or damage.   Here are some new words for 2003. 1.   Blamestorming:   Sitting around in a group, discussing why a deadline was missed or a project failed, and who was responsible.  2.   Seagull Manager:   A manager who flies in, makes a lot of noise, craps on everything, then leaves.  3.   Salmon Day :  The experience of spending an entire day swimming upstream only to get screwed and die in the end.  Yep, know that one.  4.   Cube Farm :  An office filled with cubicles.  5.   Prairie Dogging:   When someone yells or drops something loudy in a cube farm, and people's heads pop up over the walls to see what's going on.  6.  Crop Dusting:  Surreptitiously farting while passing through a cube farm, then enjoying the sounds of dismay and disgust:  leads to prairie dogging.   And also, I was just wondering about some people.  Ya know how VH-1 has the "Where Are They Now?" Well here is my own version.  What ever happened to Andrew Shue?  Josie Bissett?  Kristy Swanson?  Ya know the original Buffy.  She was slaying vampires way before Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is now married to my boyfriend by the way.  I can't believe Freddie dumped me for her.  And what is Tony Danza doing these days.  And Judith Light?  Oh yeah, I think she does Lifetime Movies now.    I just want to apologize to my readers for going off on a tangent.  Not really, I just wanted to say "my readers".

      Alright, I have been wondering something.  And this is one of my pet peeves.  When someone gets an answering machine, and they listen to the whole message and even wait for the beep, and then they hang up.  What is the point of that??  That just wastes their time and mine. Here I am sitting here thinking ok, I have another message, and then all you hear is someone hanging up.  And if you are a person who does this, you should stop it.  It's annoying!    I don't really have anything else to report today.  My weekend was pretty uneventful.  Played softball for 6 hours yesterday.  Got 2nd place in the tournament.  Beat a team that hasn't been beaten in about 3 years.  So that was exciting.  But that's about it.  Just sitting here dreading going back to work tomorrow.  I wish I could retire....I can dream right?

      I never thought I could get sick of pizza, but it's happened.  I have eaten frozen pizza every night for the past week!  Ya know, it is the easiest thing in the world to make, thus the basis of it' appeal!  But I am actually kind of tired of eating it.  Guess I will have to move on to something else frozen and easy to make.  That brings me to the next point....my best friend Shelly has turned into a granola head.  I went to visit her in California and she had all this organic crap!  Next time I see her she will be wearing birkenstocks and letting her arm pit hair grow all long.  (Just kidding Shelly!!)  She likes it, and she thinks she will get me to start eating that stuff!  But I am not changing for anybody!    And what is with the fat construction workers?  I saw this one today, and he had a t-shirt on, tucked in mind you, and it said something with an arrow pointing down.  Now I couldn't see what it said, and I am sure I probably didn't want to, but it was the last thing I needed to see right before lunch.  But how much do they have to pay these people to stand around and watch the other people drive the machines?  I mean I can hold a sign for $16 an hour.  I am not sure that I could work with fat, bad t-shirt guy, but I could hold a sign.  Do you think those people are happy?  Holding on to a sign all day long?  Something to ponder....

      Another day at work!  Update on my SeaMonkeys!  Two of them were getting it on for 3 days!  The Grand Puba, which is the biggest one, was mounting another one.  I was about to separate them, but finally they gave it a rest.  What a life!    So my place of employment is the potluck capital of the world.  People are all, "Hey, it's Friday, let's have a potluck."  "Hey, it's Flag Day, let's have a potluck."  And all these people wonder why they gain weight!  We stand around and graze all day like cattle!  It's ridiculous!    I have a softball game tonight at 9:00.  That's kind of late, some people have jobs ya know!  But I am just hoping I don't fall on my face again.  I fell twice over first base and tore up my knees!  Talk about embarrassing.  I couldn't even believe it.  The first time sucked, but then when I did it again, I was just said,"You have got to be kidding me, that did not just happen AGAIN!!!!"  So just call me Grace!

      I went back to work today after a week off!  Boy did that suck!  You never know how much you really hate your job until you have to go back after a nice long, relaxing vacation.  But I was glad to see my SeaMonkeys were well cared for while I was gone.  They are getting so big!  Yeah I said SeaMonkeys!  Let me just tell you about the life of a seamonkey!  They swim around all day long, and all they do is eat, hump, and poop.  Not necessarily in that order.....but that's what they do!    I have just one complaint about sitting in a cubicle, well just one right now.  But why do people around you think that just because they can hear your conversation, they must be involved in your conversation?  I sit near a few people I cannot stand, but I somehow get into a conversation with them everyday.  I don't understand it!  Oh yeah!  And men SUCK!!!!  I'm out!

      So I have the most bizarre dreams after I have had a few drinks!  Last night I dreamt of tennis courts in my backyard.  And I coudn't serve a tennis ball to save my life.  I just kept trying and trying, but I just couldn't do it.  Then there were certain balls that were "diseased" and you had to try and avoid them.  Then all of a sudden we were out of tennis balls, so I was wading through a creek looking for balls.  WHAT???  What does all this mean??  Anyone out there analyze dreams??    I went out for my birthday last night!  Pretty uneventful.  I did see a really drunk guy lying in the street with his pants around his ankles though!  That was pretty much the most excitng thing that happened all night.  I have to get out of this town!    And I have friends who annoy me.  That can't be good.  Should people's voices get under my skin like so?  I am starting to think I may need to work in an office all alone, not dealing with people at all!!  Is that possible?

      Tomorrow is my 25th birthday!  Not really looking forward to it!  Another year gone by, nothing accomplished!  But what else is new?  I think this might be my year though!  I totally have an opportunity to move somewhere and start all over.  Now if I can just get the balls to do it I will be all set!  Any words of encouragement are accepted.

      Ok, so here I am!!  Shelly got me started on this Blog thing!  I think it's a great idea!  And you are probably wondering what is with the titles and names and all that!  I used krispykristi because right now I am sitting here burnt to a crisp!  I just got back from California!  And boy did I get some sun!  It hurts like hell!  Those of you who know me know that I am a tad bit fair skinned!  So two hours on the beach, and bam you have 2nd degree burns and sun poisoning!  It's wonderful!  I feel so good right now!  That's sarcasm by the way!    And the Heavens Ta Besty, well that is just a little inside joke between a friend and I!  ( You know who you are)

       "Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own."   So I was coming back from lunch today and there was this car in front of me with the license plate that said "FARTBX", are you kidding me?  And it looked like a piece of shit, and sounded like a fartbox.  It was that weird gold color, ya know the baby shit color, and it had no muffler so it was loud.  My friend Nikki and I were cracking up.  Why would anyone actually put that on their license plate?  I mean are you asking to be made fun of.  Driving that car isn't enough humiliation??  HAHA!!!    It is only September 30th and I have had to scrape my windshield already!  Now that's crazy!  Tomorrow it will probably snow or something!    I have a new pet....a beta fish!  My mom bought me one.  I wonder if that's her way of trying to get me to stay!  She should have went with the dog!  I might have considered it then.  No not really!  I would just take him with me!  But I read up on these beta fish, and supposedly they learn to recognize you and will swim up to the glass to see you!  So I guess I better do some bonding with him.  I should probably name him!  I could name him Killer....yeah maybe I will!  I have a minor setback in my moving plans, but I will be there before the end of October!  I have to get there for Shelly and Scott's B-day.  So I am getting ready to call Discover to see if they can up my credit limit just a tad, so I can transfer one more balance over to it.  DAMN Shopping!!  Looking good comes with consequences!!  I know first hand!  So anyway, my mom may not be willing to help me, but I am going whether she does or not.  I have to do this, and if I struggle a little bit that's ok.  It builds character right?  What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger!!!  Yeah I guess so!

       "Friendship may, and often does, grow into love, but love never subsides into friendship."   The weekend is over once again.  I spend the whole week waiting for the weekend, and the whole weekend wishing the week would never come.  Maybe that's my problem, I wish too much.  Anyway, today was kind of a bad day.  I lied to someone that I really like, and it really bothered me, so I finally just came clean.  And thankfully he understood, and said it wasn't a big deal.  It did upset him somewhat, but he is willing to look past it.  I am so mad at myself about the whole situation!  It was just this little stupid white lie, but it was still a lie.  And I am terrible at lying.  Which is good!  But anyway, I am done doing that.  I have found that it's best to be completely honest with people, no matter how embarrassing the situation.  There's my little moral for the day!!    It's weird the effect crying has on a person.  It physically makes me tired.  My eyes are all swollen and stinging.  And tomorrow they will be puffy.  Sometimes it feels so good to just have a good cry, but the after effects suck!  I could go to bed right now, and it's only 9:00.    I cannot wait to go see The School of Rock!  Jack Black is hilarious!!  That is one movie I would definitely go to the movies to see.  I don't particularly like going to the movies.  I get really annoyed at hearing other people eat popcorn!  Last time I went, there was this guy in the back row, and all he did was talk the whole time.  Now I did not pay $6.00 to listen to his dumb ass make obvious statements about the movie.  And he must have gotten refills on his popcorn at least twice.  I mean did you come to watch the movie, or just to talk and eat popcorn?  So anyway, that's why I hate going to the movies!

       "Lovers speak a language only understood by two."   No Amy, I am not dead.  I can't believe I went a whole week without blogging.  But just as I have managed to avoid talking to most of my friends, I have avoided blogging for some reason.  Maybe I was just tired of dealing with my feelings!  Sometimes it's easier to ignore them.  So anyway, I am talking to my mom tonight.  See if she would be willing to help me out with my move.  If she is, then I am out of here in October!!!!  I am so excited.  And a little scared.  But Shelly always makes me feel better about all of my fears.  And she told me to give it to God and I did.  And now I am 100% sure that I want to move.  So that's it!    I made one of my best friends cry today, and I was so sad.  It is this gut wreching feeling to think that you are making someone that sad.  I was talking to her about moving and she just started crying and walked away from my desk!  I was surprised, but I shouldn't have been.  She is an emotional person, and a true blue friend.  But she makes me feel that it's ok to be an emotional person!  I try to hide it so much sometimes, but with her I don't have to do that.  She is one of the people I will miss the most, but I told her today that I will never forget her, and I will never lose touch with her.  Ok, so anyway, now I am crying!  I am such a sap anymore!  Oh well!     Just got back from my walk!  It's so nice to walk now, in this fall weather.  It just get's dark so early now, so I have to start leaving earlier.  Or start booking it!  I think I will leave earlier!    Later peeps!

       "Try doing the thing it is that you think you cannot do.  Prove yourself wrong."   I am a terrible friend.  I should be in California right now with Shelly, but instead I am pussy footin around here bitching about how much I hate it.  I should be sharing bills with her.  I have just been in this funk lately, and I don't know what to do to get out.  If any of you think it has been a little difficult to get ahold of me, there's a reason for that.  I have pretty much just stopped taking calls.  I come home from work and just avoid everyone.  My friend King called me the other night, and I usually love talking to him.  I haven't talked to him since July, and I let it go to voice mail, and I haven't called him back yet.  And I hate that.  And Amy, sorry girl!  I know I need to call you back!  I'm sorry!    I am so tired of feeling like this.  I don't know what to even do anymore, how to make myself feel better.  I guess I need to stop being afraid of life, and get out there and live it.  Stop taking the safe road, and take some chances once in awhile.  I am not entirely happy at my job, but it's safe and it's what I know.  Even though I am under paid, unchallenged, and bored.  Three very good reasons to get out and find a new job. I really think a lot of it may be a lack of confidence in myself.  Like I am not smart enough, or experienced enough to get a new job out there in the world.  I am 25 years old, and have been working for the same company since I was 19.  Now I am much too young to have been working at the same place for 6 years.  Granted I have been in many different positions, still that's crazy!  I really need to get over this comfort thing.  I did the same thing with an ex-boyfriend.  We all know who that is!  I won't mention any names!  But I have got to do something before I end up 35 years old and still living in this damn place!    So it's amazing what exercising does for you.  I have been sleeping so much better now that I have started walking again.  And I can actually get up in the morning.  Well it's easier anyway, not that I want to get up.  I just have more energy, and I wonder why I quit walking for all those months.  So I am totally advocating exercise!  But I am tired now, so I am going to bed!

       "Feeling impatient is wasted energy.  Learn to understand the reason for the delay and relax-anger won't speed things along."   I really should read this quote every day.  I can tend to be a bit impatient.  That might be a bit of an understatement.  But anyway, I had an okay weekend.  Nothing too exciting.  A guy did give me his phone number.   He wrote it on a piece of paper and stuck it in my purse.  Is that a way to avoid rejection?  I can't say no thank you if I don't know he is giving it to me.  I don't know.  That is probably what I would do if I gave someone my phone number.  Probably slip it somewhere so he would find it later.  But I am a big chicken anyway.  I hung out with a friend I haven't seen since Christmas.  It was fun just to sit and drink a couple beers and catch up.  Didn't go out to the bars and it was nice.  And I talked him into taking me golfing.  He might be sorry later, but for some reason I have really been wanting to learn to golf.  Maybe it's because I am getting older, and I need slower paced sports to play.  Nice quiet sports.    I was just watching Animal Planet and it blows my mind that people can mistreat animals the way they do.  And they don't realize they can be arrested for it.  Like the life of an animal is not important, and if they decide they don't want to take care of it anymore, they don't have to.  I was almost crying watching it.  Some of the things they do, or let happen to these animals are ridiculous.  Today is such a fallesque day.  Is that a word?  I don't know.  But it's really starting to feel like fall, and I love it.  It was nice and cool and breezey today.  I am just waiting for the leaves to start turning.

       "Go searching in expectation of what love will give you, and you will never find it.  Open your heart and be prepared only to give, and love will find you."

       "Allow yourself to be organized, it may be all you need to find happiness."   Tonights blog will be about addictions.  Because  I think I have one.  SHOPPING!!!!  I cannot control myself.  I am like an alcoholic sitting in a bar trying not to have a drink.  I went shopping tonight with a friend and all I was going to do was return some things, but it didn't quite turn out that way.  I spend money, and it feels good, until I get home.  Then I start having buyer's remorse!  But not enough to actually take anything back.  I seriously think I have a problem.  I had to fight with every fiber of my being to not buy another pair of shoes.  But I did buy another one of those "classic black shirts".  I mean you can never have too many right.  See??  I even make excuses to buy things!  I need to just stay out of the mall!  But I am drawn to it.  I really think I may look up shopaholics anonymous.  Do they have a 12 step program?  Hi I'm Kristi, and I'm a shopaholic.  HI KRISTI!!  Please!!  Someone help me!    I just have one complaint.  I did return something that I bought a few months ago, and the credit card that I used has been paid off.  I closed the account.  So she said it needed to go back on the visa, and at the time I didn't remember which one I used.  So I gave her the one I had, and she said it wasn't that one.  I told her I didn't have it anymore.  She got an attitude with me.  And I was thinking it's my money, no matter what card you put it back on.  I am not trying to pull a scam on them.   I mean what is the difference really?  That $40.00 is mine no matter which way ya slice it.  So then she says, "Well next time it has to go on the card it was purchased on, just so you know."  And I wanted to say, "There won't be a next time, don't worry!"  I am big on customer service, and I understand she was doing her job, but she was being straight up rude!  So whatever!  Just give me my money back!  Geez!  I have the receipt, you're lucky you are getting that!  So my friend that I went shopping with has a little boy, and he is a year old.  They have all the Halloween costumes out.  We put him in the Monster's Inc, ya know the blue guy.  Oh he was so cute!!!  Then he fell asleep on the way home, and Nikki was putting her stuff in the house, so I got him out of the car seat and his little head was on my shoulder.  There is just something about that.  Those little things!  I really think I can understand a mother's love, well to some extent.  I mean you just look at them sleeping in their car seat, or watch them walking around, or laughing.  It really is an amazing thing!  Kids are awesome!  Well until they walk up to your golf cart and start touching your stuff and asking for your golf clubs!

       "Happiness can come freely and unexpectedly-don't seek it too desperately.  Relax, it will appear."   So I just blogged, and then I lost it!  I was a little upset because it was a good one.  Just a minor setback.  No big deal!  I will just start from the top!  I had an epiphany today.  I realized that there are several things I take for granted everyday, and there are several things about myself I need to change.  A woman I work with has cancer, and she got some test results back today, and she is not doing well.  Her chemo is not helping much, and the tumors are growing and spreading.  She had three children, and she is not very old, and still has so much living to do.  And then there is me, who gets upset about such petty things.  I bet she would give anything to switch places with right now.  I just sat there and thought about how lucky I am to have my health and my family and friends.  I have more than everything I need to be happy in this world, yet I want more.  And I know wanting to better my life is not selfish, but some of the things I complain about are just ridiculous.  And this woman's body is being invaded by this disgusting disease.  And there isn't anything she can do about it.  And I hate it.  Cancer affects so many people everyday.  And I know God has a plan for everyone, but sometimes it is so hard to keep that perspective.  But I thank God everyday that he didn't take my mom away from me.  But how does he decide?  Does he draw straws?  What?  My mom never smoked or drank a day in her life, and she still got it.  Which ups my odds by 50%.  So then I think, hey why not go live my life however I want, smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, eat junk food.  But my mom is here.  It was a long hard battle, and times when she wanted to give up, but she didn't.  I wouldn't let her.  My mom beat it, and has been cancer free for 6 years!  So I know it can be beat!  And I thank God everyday for her, and my entire family.    Ok, enough sappy stuff!  I am going crazy with these Japanese Beatles.  How do these things get in the house?  How do they find that tiny little crack or hole to get in?  They totally dive bomb you, and they land in your hair and stuff.  They are crazy little bugs!  And they are impossible to kill.  Crazy bastards!!

       "Happy people are, in general, calm people."   Today I would not know the first thing about being calm.  I almost had some major road rage on the way to work.  And this is totally warranted, so don't go there Shelly!  I was not overreacting at all.  This bit@* pulls out in front of me as I am going 45 mph, and then she putts along.  So to let her know that I am pissed and I am going to pass her as soon as I have the chance, I get on her ass.  Then she starts to pull over to the side, and then she pulls back onto the road.  At this point I am about to start laying on my horn, but I didn't do it.  I remained somewhat calm.  So then she floors it and starts going like 65, and then when I catch up to her she slows down again.  And ya know, it's 7:45 in the morning on a Monday!  I am not in the mood for this shit!  Don't mess with me.  So finally I can pass her and when I got next to her I looked right at her because I was going to flip her off, but she wouldn't look.  She can mess with me on the road, but she didn't have the guts to look at me.  HAHA!!!  I was really mad though.  She was the one going 45 in a 55.  Shelly, have the car ready, we may need to go to Mexico!  I am out of control!!!!  So anyway, I got to work, and one of my seamonkeys was dead.  Now I thought when they died they would float to the top like fish do, but they don't.  They just sink to the bottom.  I don't know if I should try to get it out, or if I should just let it be.  My poor little seamonkey!!    I tried Liquid Band-Aid today!  Good stuff!  Why didn't I think of that?    And on Shelly and Amy's note about soda.  I have been calling it soda for awhile now.  I think that's because people I work with call it that.  And after you say it a few times, you get used to it.  And I say bag, as in plastic bag.  I don't say sack.    Fall is truely in the air, and I love it.  It's warm during the day, and cool at night.  I love to sleep with my window open, and cuddle up in my comforter.  I just can't wait for the trees to start turning colors.  Wonder what fall is like in California.  I was thinking the other day, that I may miss Illinois winters just a little bit, but then I got over it.  I love to watch snow falling, but I do not like having to go out in it.  So I am sure I won't miss it too much.    I will take the beach over snow anyday!  Hmmmm, walking in snow, walking in sand....tough choice.

       "Happiness lies in becoming unafraid of change."    "I'd say in a given week I only do about 15 minutes of real, actual work."     No talent ass clowns!!  I think I am really starting to reflect this guy from Office Space, just not quite as extreme.  But that is so totally the  way I am feeling about work these days.  I am so glad that movie was on tonight!  I think that is just what I needed today!  And did I mention that I actually have a red swingline stapler?  Oh yeah!  I do!  That's going to be worth something someday!  You don't see those everyday.    I really don't want to go to work tomorrow.  I hate this feeling.  Knowing the weekend is almost over.  It's depressing.  I really wish I could take some time off.  All these other people do it, they get a doctor to write them off work, saying they are stressed or some shit like that.  I honestly believe that Boise employees may have single handedly caused insurance rates to go up.  But what can you do?  Can't really argue with a doctor's note.  I need to get me one.  It would say, "Kristi needs to be off work for some time to regain her sanity.  If she is not allowed this time, I fear she may harm someone, and it could turn into a blood bath."  I think HR would say, "Take all the time you need.  Check yourself in somewhere.  Insurance will cover it."  HAHA!  One of my good friends at work told me she was worried about me and my "postality."  I told her, "First of all, "postality" isn't a word, and second of all I wouldn't hurt you."  But some of the peopl I work with are so incredibly stupid.  I can't believe they are even allowed to leave the house.  I just really wonder how these people make it through life.     My stomach has really been bothering me lately, and I am starting to think maybe I should go to the doctor.  But I really hate going to the doctor.  And there are a ton of reasons I hate going to the doctor, but I won't get into all that.  But mostly I just feel like they don't listen to what you are telling them.  And that's actually one of the main reasons I wanted to get into the medical field.  I wanted to be different than all those rude nurses, receptionists, x-ray techs, etc.  The last thing you need when you go to someone for help is them being rude to you.  I hate that more than anything.  I wanted to get into the medical field and be someone they remember because I was compassionate, and I helped them and made them feel comfortable.  Without sounding cheesy, I just want to help people.  People who are in need of medical attention, or who are less fortunate, or who are in a predicament and they have no one to turn to.    Geez, when I first started blogging, I didn't think I had anything to say.  Guess I was wrong.  So I am done now, I am going to watch Court TV.  Love it!!!

       "Don't burden yourself with anger for your enemies.  Forgive them.  That'll make them really angry."   Kill 'em with kindness.  That's what I say!  So I had kind of an emotional day today, and I really, really, need to do something about this.  Lately I have been getting so upset over things, things that should not upset me.  But I let them get to me and then I just get pissed off and annoyed.  I think one of the reasons I have been getting so upset lately is because I have realized that I don't really do anything for myself.  I try to do what everyone else wants me to do, or what I  think  they want me to do.  If it came down to not  stepping on someone's toes, or making myself happy, I would choose not to step on someone's toes.  I really need to start putting myself first in certain situations.  I am tired of being upset and angry all the time.  I really feel like a lost soul.  Just kind of wandering around trying to find my place in this world.  I think I know what I want, and I know what I have to do to get it, but there is just something holding me back.  I wish I could get a handle on that.  But I have no idea what it is.  I like to think it's just money, but in the back of my head I think I have a fear of something.  I kind of know what it is, but it seems so silly.  When I think about what I want in life, it's the typical dream that most people have, but for some reason I can't see myself attaining it.  Career, husband, dog, kids.  Typical!  But that's what I want.  I want to take care of someone, and have his children, and play out in the backyard.  I want to be settled and happy and calm.  But I will just have faith, I know God has something planned for me!  So I will just go with the flow.  So I am sitting here trying to decide if I want to go out.  I went out last night, had a couple beers, and felt like I was going to throw up!  I am such a lightweight anymore!  I could drink more in highschool.  And it was so much more fun then.  The thrill of the chance of getting caught!  Partying out in the country sitting around a fire.  Now that was fun!  Sitting in a bar, not so fun.  I want a good fall party around the fire before I leave for Cali.  Even if I have to sit out in my back yard alone, I will!  WHAT A LOSER!!!!  Oh well!

       "Happiness is where you are and what you do.  It's all about choices."   Ok, today was the worst day!  I really should have stayed in bed.  First of all I was completely exhausted.  I am not sure how much sleep I actually require to function normally, but I did not get enough last night.  So anyway, it started by me getting behind some person who obviously did not know the speed limit was 55, so he should have been going about 70.  So anyway, I finally got to work, and I wanted a cup of coffee, and the good kind costs $1.00.  So I grabbed 4 quarters out of my drawer and hauled my happy ass to the cafeteria.  The damn coffee machine wouldn't take my quarters, and there wasn't a soul in there to ask for a dollar.  So I walked back to my desk and grabbed a dollar bill.  Get back in there and it still won't take my money.  So I came back and threw my money on my desk and sat down.  And for those of you who know me well know that I can tend to be somewhat of a hothead.  So later a friend of mine comes over and asks me to go to the cafeteria, so I figure, yeah I can get a soda instead.  So I decide I want to try the new vanilla diet pepsi.  I put my dollar in the machine and what comes out?  A regular diet pepsi, no vanilla.....ok, so at this point I have pretty much gone over the edge.  This is all happening before 8:30.  I am thinking it's not going to be a good day.  I really didn't do any work until about 3:00, and I honestly couldn't tell you what I did all morning either.  I think I was in a completely different place.  I do remember hilighting some things, but I don't know what.  And I may have drawn my name in block letters, in different colors of ink.  That's really about it!    My mind has really been a million miles away!  Half the time I don't even know what I was thinking earlier in the day.  Hence me not knowing what the hell I did all day long at work.  I have just been consumed with so many different thoughts, and I have no idea how to sort them.  I think I may have mentioned this before, but now I just think my head is up my butt!  I made the most stupid mistake today at work, so then I had to stay almost an hour to make sure it was all taken care of.  Oh well, I fixed it!  No big whoop!

       "Happiness costs nothing and is worth so much."   I had kind of a strange dream last night.  Not really sure what to make of it.  I dreamt that I wanted to go to this bar because there was this guy there that I wanted to see.  None of my friends would go in there with me, which I think relates back to yesterday's blog.  But when I got inside the bar, it was a big swimming pool, and there was a shark swimming around in it.  Then they got the shark out, and I still wouldn't go in, but then they put a different shark in the pool, but he was "friendly."  Who knows what that is supposed to mean?  Then it turned into a dream about Ashton Kutcher, and he wanted to go out with me.  But he was still with Jackie, like in "That 70's Show" and he had to break up with her.  And I had his e-mail address.  Who knows!!  That is the last time I eat Doritos at midnight.    Speaking of Ashton, I just watched Just Married.  Great movie.  I laughed and I cried.  If you haven't seen that movie yet, you really need to get out and rent it.  I seriously laughed my ass off, and then of course at the end I cried.  I give it two thumbs up.  I will definitely be buying it.      I really can't believe it's September already.  I guess I need to start making some decisions about this California thing.  I know, I know Shelly!  Pack up my shit!  I am, I am !    It's raining again today.  I don't really mind though!  It's nice and cool, and really reminds me of Fall.  I love fall, it's my favorite season.  I think that stems back to highschool.  Fall was volleyball  and football season.   And Homecoming, and toilet papering.  Ah those were the days!  And I love the cool, brisk air, and all the trees turning colors.  Going out in jeans and a sweatshirt and being completely comfortable.  It's the simple things that make me happy!

       "Happiness is feeling that the world needs your work."   Today was a completely worthless day at work.  Everyone was all dressed up and having potlucks.  I spent most of my day walking around.  I would end up back at my desk every 10 minutes or so, just so my sup wouldn't think I was totally abandoning my work.  The work was scarce, but every once in awhile I would find something.  I didn't dress up today after all because it turns out that my boobs are a bit bigger than they were in highschool.  I got it zipped up to that point and after that it just wasn't budging.  But I am dressing up tonight.  I am going to be a sorceress tonight, with blue hair!  How fun.  I hope no one recognizes me.  I am going to hooch up the outfit just a bit.  You know wear some knee high boots, and a push up bra!  YEAH!!!  So I guess I am actually going to be a slutty sorceress.....! Maybe I will get some free drinks out of it.

       "Anything I've ever done that ultimately was worthwhile initially scared me to death."  Amy Birge Betty Bender  Amy I am using one of your quotes because I like it!!!    I officially quit my job and my last day is November 11th.  It's so weird.  I don't think it's really hit me yet, but I am sure that my last day will be really hard.  I have made so many good friends working there.  But I can't stay at a job I don't enjoy for my friends.  But I really feel like I have made the right decision.  I am not regretting it, and I don't think I will.  This will be a good experience for me.  It might be hard at first, but I will get through it.  So I have a ton of things to do.  I need to look into the U-Hauls, and get my crap packed, and get my finances in order.....ugh!  So much to do, I better get started.  I went to see Texas Chainsaw Massacre last night.  That movie was messed up.  I never saw the original, but I am thinking I need to go rent it.  I thought for sure I would have some whacked dreams last night, but I didn't.  I wasn't really even scared after we left the theater.  But it was good to see just in time for Halloween.  Speaking of Halloween, I am supposed to dress up tomorrow.  We decided at the last minute to do Gilligan's Island.  Our titles are SSS's so we are doing our supervisor's cubicle as the SSS Minnow, and I am going to get out one of my old prom dresses and go as Ginger.  I am not really much for dressing up, especially at work, but since I am leaving I figured what the hell.  So I need to see if I can find my dresses.  This should be interesting, better take a camera!  Well I gotta go pay some bills.  Happy Halloween!!!!

       "Learn to find joy in the simple things, the quiet things, and the things that come free."   Yesterday I did something that I found joy in and it was simple, it was quiet, and it was free.  I layed on the couch all day yesterday.  I did not get up for hours.  It was great.  I didn't take a shower until 5:00 p.m. and then I layed on the couch some more.  I pretty much avoided all human contact.  But that's ok!  Sometimes you gotta.  So tomorrow I want to give my two week notice.  It's going to be so weird.  I have been working for this company for almost 6 years.  Which is good and pathetic all in one.  I mean I have been there since I was 19, and I have been in my current department for 3 years.  I made a ton of friends there, so it will be hard to leave all of them, but ya gotta do whatcha gotta do right?  I am a little nervous about finding a job in Bakersfield, but I am sure I will find something.  Gotta take some risks in life.  I am tired of sticking around this place because it's comfortable.    I am watching Reno 911, still think it's one of the funniest shows I have seen.  It's about Halloween.  Speaking of Halloween, I think I work with a witch.  Now I don't really believe in witchcraft too much, but I really think this chic has a huge book at home full of spells or something.  I just picture this big huge dusty book, sitting on a podium type thing.  I really try to stay on her good side because I prefer not to have a spell cast on me.    I think I am still living in 2002 because I still have dial up connection on my computer, and it takes like 10 minutes to pull up a website.  And I am not the most patient person in the world.  Now I don't know if anyone knew that about me, but I'm not!  SURPRISE!!!!  Alright I am retiring to the couch!  Check ya'll later!

      I was just reading some of my past blogs, and I am realizing that I am starting to get boring in my blogs.  But not too many funny things have been happening.  But last weekend, a lot of funny things happened, and I totally forgot to report them in my blog.  First funny thing that happened in Chicago.....we stopped to ask for directions to Indiana because J wanted to go to the Horseshoe Riverboat.  The man in the gas station was kind of slow, and he had a Cubs hat on with like a thousand pins on it.  He started to give the directions and J reached for a pen and said he needed to write it down.  The guy slapped his hand and said, "No writing, just listening."  I was cracking up....and then he said, "When you pay your $2.00 Illinois toll, pay by human, and they will direct you further."  PAY BY HUMAN????   Then one day we were walking down the street and this guy was chasing J to shine his shoes.  First of all he had tennis shoes on, and they were practically brand new.  He just started spraying stuff on his shoes, so he had to let him wipe them off.  The guy told him that if he could tell him how many children his father had he would ONLY charge him $5.00 a shoe.  Then he comes back with, "Your father didn't have any children, your mother had them all."  WHAT??  J gave him $3.00 and we were on our way.  It just amazes me how many people are on the streets doing these things for money.  There was this one guy playing his saxaphone on the corner, and he was dancing all over the place.  He seemed like he was out there doing it because he was having fun, not because he was looking for money.  I love the city, I am not sure that I could live there, but it's nice to go spend the weekend there.  I like the fast paced atmosphere for a little while.

       "Depression has a knack of feeding on itself, but cannot live in a calm heart."   Well I talked to my mom about a loan, and she didn't say no.  She didn't say yes either, but she did not say no.  And I don't think she will.  But we'll see.  She's in St. Louis right now helping my brother move, so maybe she will think about it while she's away.  So we will see what happens, but I want to put in my two weeks notice on Monday.    But tonight I want to go out and get totally wasted!  I am just in a bummed out mood!  I know alcohol is not the answer, but I just need a couple beers!  So I am outta here!

       "Don't expect the impossible of yourself-there are limitations to being human."   You know the saying,"You are your own worst critic"?  It's true.  Nobody can criticize me like I can.  And it's really starting to bring me down.  Sometimes I feel like I need to constantly be reassured of everything.  I really hate that about myself.  I think about things way too much!  I stew over them, and analyze them to death.  I drive myself crazy over things sometimes....and I am not quite sure why, or how to stop doing it.  And sometimes I think I fall for people way too easily....and the feelings are not reciprocated.  Now I am not 100% sure that they aren't, but that's where the insecurities come in.  I somehow convince myself that the person I like does not feel the same way about me.  What is my problem??  Anyone have any ideas?   I am done writing for now...I'm depressing myself!

      I had a great weekend!  And I was just catching up on everyone's blogs!  Very interesting!  Cory...you are very talkative when you are drunk!  I like it though!  Maybe someday we can all get together again and get drunk!  I have a really bad feeling today, and I am not sure why.  But have you ever missed someone so much it hurts?  I have broken down into tears like 3 times today!  And I am being ridiculous!  But I had a really great weekend with a guy I really really really like, and now I am away from him and I hate it!  And I have this bad, awful feeling in the pit of my stomach right now, and I don't know what it is.  My insecurities possibly?  Maybe I am scared that he doesn't feel the same way about me, but I shouldn't be!  I just get so paranoid about things like this.  But anyway, forget it!  But anyway, we went to Chicago, and it was a beautiful weekend.  The weather was georgeous!  Went to the Shedd Aquarium, Planetarium, Field Museum, Navy Pier, Billy Goat Tavern!!  Cheezborger! Cheezborger!  Went to Indiana to the Horseshoe Riverboat.  Not much of a gambler, but it was something to do!  Went to Wrigley Field on Sunday!  I just had an awesome time this weekend....and I really hope I get to spend more time with this person in the future!!   I know all of you are sitting there thinking, "Who the hell is she talking about?"  And don't worry!  I will fill you all in....eventually!!  HAHA!   I love leaving people haning!!  Later...going to paint my nails!

       "Those who want to succeed will surely find a way, and those who don't will find an excuse."  Ain't that the truth!    I got a nice card from Amy today.  Sometimes I wonder about you Am!  But anyway, thank you!  I love getting those little unexpected gifts in the mail!  And I know what you mean about not being a rock star anymore, because I certainly am not!    So I bought a CUBS sweatshirt today!  I will admit, I am a band wagon fan, but if it were the White Sox I would be the same way!  The CUBS are my home team!  I have to root for them!  Who knows, maybe I will become a permanent fan!  I can't promise anything though!    Well I don't have much to say today, I am going to eat dinner, take a hot bath, and give myself a pedicure!  Goodnight!

      Hey!  Shelly......smartass!  Here's a new blog....now you have met.  You know I haven't had time to blog!  But we won't get into that.....So here I am, I'm sick, my nose is running, I am sneezing, and my head feels like it weighs 50lbs.  But it's all good! I'll get better!   I guess I haven't blogged in awhile, but that's because I don't have much to say.  Well I have something I want to tell everyone about, but I don't want to jinx it.  So you will all have to wait until next week to hear my great news!!  Let's just say I am pumped about this weekend.  Then I will probably have lots to say.    Basically everything is still the same, work still sucks, I still live here, and I am still lost.    So that's about it!  Nothing has changed.

       "When love turns bad, it is like watching the Sugar Plum Fairy turn into a machete wielding terrorist."   HAHA!!  That quote is hilarious.  I would never have thought of that!!  Classic!    I had a good day at work today.  I am suffering from a slight lack of sleep, so I was a little slap happy!  I think I am considered the "class clown" at work!  But I like it!  I love to make jokes and make my co-workers laugh!  It's really the only way to keep my sanity in that place sometimes!    So I was glad to see that Cory finally blogged again!  Geez, I thought you disappeared.  You need to send me some more pictures of Madeline.  She probably looks so different now!  And thank you for praying for me, I guess I should be doing a little more of that myself!  I guess I am kind of expecting things to just kind of fall into place.  And we all know that's not going to happen!    I want to see Chain Saw Massacre.  I just saw a preview for it, and it looks good.  I am always up for a horror flick!  As long as I am not watching it alone.  Then I get all freaked out, I am afraid to even move from whatever spot I watched the movie from!  And I think that hiding under the blankets will protect me!  It's amazing what your imagination can do to you!  Amy knows!    I have been thinking that I really need to go through my clothes and get rid of crap!  I have so many things I never even wear.  I found a shirt in my closet that still has the tags on it!  I didn't even know I had it!  So I am sure I could have done with out it.  And I have two big boxes of shoes, and shoes in my closet, and shoes in another closet.  It's crazy!  I could probably make some cash if I had a big rummage sale, but I hate rummage sales!  I am outta here, got some movies to watch!

       "To the world you may just be someone, but to someone you may be the world."   It's friggin cold here!!!  I went walking tonight, and I think I have wind burn and frost bite all in one.  Ok, well maybe I am exaggerating a little, but I think it's awfully cold for early October.  But it's good because I get my walk in much faster.  I am booking it just trying to get home.   I had to scrape my windows again this morning!  That sucked!  That was my excuse for being late to work....I really just don't care.  As long as I stroll in by 8:30, I'm good!  Nobody's paying attention.    I'm watching Cops right now!  Best show ever.  I may have mentioned that, but I really do like watching it!  Some of these people are so funny!  The undercover drug stings are the best!  I like the police chases too!  Those are good!  Oh here's a classic one, some dude trying to sell drugs with his 2 year old daughter in the car.  TRASH!!    Alright, well I am going to see what's going on in Chicago for Halloween!  I am up for some fall festivities.

      Hey people!  Did you miss me?  Well I made it to Bakersfield last Friday, so I have been here a week now.  I am sitting at Shelly's fave cafe so I could check my e-mail and blog and all that shit!  I am kind of bummed today, and I am not sure why.  But I have to try to keep myself busy, or I am afraid I will want to go home.  Thanksgiving was ok.  I went to John's, but they sat and played poker all day and I was pretty much the beer bitch.....but whatever.    The trip out here was good.  The Sunday I left was terrible.  I kept crying all day long.  John kept telling me it was going to be ok....but I was just sad.  My mom was ok until I actually left.  Then I hugged her she started to cry, so I told her I loved her and I just walked out.  I get teary eyed just thinking about it.  I cried for the first hour or so.  But I am doing ok now.  I knew it would get easier.  We left at midnight and drove all the way through until we got to Texas.  Then we drove all the way to Arizona.  We stopped at the Grand Canyon which was beautiful!  My pictures look just like the post cards.  I wish I could post them here.  Then on to Vegas.  We spend two nights in Vegas, and I had fun, but I was absolutely pissed off at John.  See, he's a gambler and I am not.  So he sat and played Blackjack, I went to the room when he started playing Texas hold'em.  He didn't come back to the room until 8:00 the next morning.  So waking him up was really fun!  The next day we walked around, but of course we ended up back in a casino where he spent 5 hours playing blackjack!  Needless to say I was getting pissed.  I played the slot machines a little bit, but I didn't want to gamble the money I had to live off of.  So anyway, when he finally lost his money he was wasted, and that started a whole other issue.  Suddenly I had a child to take care of and I was not happy about that.  I took him to get something to eat and I was just trying to keep him from spilling or knocking things over.  The waitress came over and asked what we wanted and he simply replied, "Ranch", that was it.  So I had to order for him.  Then when he was done eating he got up and I should have known better than to let him go off by himself....but I thought he just had to use the restroom or something.  A few minutes later I have the manager and a waitress looking at me. The manager asks me if thats my husband over there.  I was like where is he.  I get up and he is lying in a booth.  So I start pulling on his arm trying to get him up, but he weighs quite a bit more than me, so that wasn't working out to well.  So basically at this point I am extremely pissed off and embarrassed, and I am cussing him up one side and down the other.  I was begging him to not embarrass me anymore.  So then I get in line to get another room for the night, b/c obviously we can drive 4 hours at this point, and he wanders off to go to the bathroom.  After five minutes I knew he wasn't coming back.  So once I got the room I had to try and find him.  Finally I found him.  Turns out he was up lying in front of our room from the night before.  Security was involved and all that.  I was never so happy to just get him into bed where I knew he couldn't get into anymore trouble.  But the next morning when I told him all this stuff he was pretty embarrassed.  But not as embarrassed as me the night before.  So that's my Vegas experience.  I think next time I will just go with my girlfriends.  Hope he doesn't read this.  He might be kind of mad that I told all of you this!  But oh well!  Ok, so I need to go do some job hunting!  Talk to you all later!  Oh and Amy?  Great that you have comments, but I couldn't get in to leave one.  Might want to take a look at that.  And next, get the links to everyone's blogs.  It's a big help!!  Later everyone!

       "We nurture happiness by recognizing all the beauty that surrounds us and by giving thanks for the many blessings we've been given."   That quote is in honor of one of my best friends Nikki.    Amy, comments.  Simple.  Call me and I can try to help you.  But you need to go to template.  But I figured it out by going up to help and typing in comments.  It tells you how to do it.  You have to copy and paste some stuff into your template.  Hope that helps.  Packing isn't going too well right now.  My room is a disaster and I have no idea what I am taking and what I am leaving.  I can't believe I am leaving in 4 days.  But I am going to Vegas for the first time and I can't wait.    My last day at work wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  I thought I would cry and be all sad, but I didn't cry.  I was a little sad to be walking out of that place for the last time.  But I am moving on.  Hopefully to bigger and better things!  I can't wait to start this new adventure.  I really think this is going to be a learning experience.  And I have tried to prepare myself for the hard times, and the times that I am going to be sad and homesick.  But I have my friends who are there, and my friends here.  Everyone is just a phone call away.

      "True love is eternal, infinite, and always like itself.  It is equal and pure, without violent demonstrations:  it is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart." Honore de Balzac  My day did not start off very well and it only got worse as the morning went on.  First I woke up with this nagging feeling that I have so much to do and only a week to do it.  So I was agitated from the get go, then I couldn't find my favorite black pants.  And now thinking back these are such petty little annoyances when you step back and take a look at the grand scheme of things.  Then the bar in my closet broke and all of my clothes are now lying on the floor.  I get to work and I had left my McDonald's cup on this coaster that I colored with markers, and the ink ran all down my desk.  It looked like someone killed someone on my desk.  So I had to clean that up.  But the worst thing today, which makes all these things look so silly is that a friend of mine lost her mother last night.  When I found out I just burst into tears.  I couldn't believe it.  This was so unexpected.  She wasn't sick and she was so young.  And it's not fair.  She and her mom were so close and I feel terrible for her.  I just wish I could see her because I just want to give her a big hug and tell her that I love her.  So I am just praying for her and hoping that she can get through this.  It's just not fair.  She shouldn't have to go through this right now.  And I wish that I could make it better for her, but I know I can't.  All I can do is be there for her.  It's just so weird.  I woke up this morning with no idea I would be getting news like that today.  I was kind of in a daze for awhile.  I called my mom and told her that she better never do that to me.  So as if I was crying enough this past weekend, I got to cry some more today at work.  I don't think I can cry anymore.  Of course when I look at my room and all the crap lying around, I might cry.  But that's a whole other story!  Well I guess I better get to work on sorting through my junk.  Wish me luck!

      I am exhausted.  I had a great weekend, but I am worn out.  My brother and sister-in-law were here this weekend with their twins, and daughter!  Let me tell you that I admire people who have twins.  That is a lot of work right there.  But they are adorable, and I love them soooo much.  So it was very beneficial to have them here this weekend.  My sister in law helped me a ton.  I guess I am just going to take whatever I can fit in my car and go.  Once I get there I will either buy new bedroom furniture or figure out a way to get mine out there.  But right now I don't want to spend the $1500.00 on a U-Haul.  I have realized that I am a tad bit spoiled, and maybe a bit stubborn.  This is going to be a great learning experience for me.  Basically I have been coddled all my life, and I have been spoiled by my parents, and I have spoiled myself.  And now I have to make all these decisions about money and what to leave behind and what to take.  I need to realize that I don't NEED these things to live.  And to have money when I get there is more important to me than having my bed.  I have a week to get all this stuff done, and I need to get moving!  I am so excited to see John too!  I can't wait til he gets here.  I have realized that this guy has done more for me in the last 3 months than any guy ever has.  He absolutely hates to fly, but he is doing it for me for the 2nd time in a month.  I mean, he wants to drive across country, but he is doing this for me.  He is great!  Ok, well I am going to go sort through some more crap!  I have 3 closets full of clothes I need to sort through!  FUN!!!!

      I guess there really is a time in your life when you find out who your real friends are.  Real friends are supportive, caring, encouraging, and nurturing.  Shitty friends are the ones who say "Ok" when you tell them you are moving 2,000 miles away.  Every single one of my "real" friends has been so great about all of this.  They all tell me that they admire me and are proud of me for taking this chance.  To all my friends that have been there for me, I Love You!  And thank you for supporting me!  To those of you who suck, I don't need you, but you won't know that because you have no idea I have this blog.  So shove off!  Wouldn't most of you say that being friends with someone since kindergarten means SOMETHING?  I mean I understand growing up and changing and all that, but life long friends should outweigh that.  Maybe I am just naive....but I thought I had a couple good friends right here.  Turns out all my good friends live in other towns and states!    I have another decision to make about my move.  A U-Haul is going to cost almost $1500.00 and it would almost be cheaper to just buy new bedroom furniture when I get there.  I do want to take my bed though.  So I have no idea what to do now.  I really like my furniture, but I also love buying new things!  So who knows what I will do.  I guess I will just see how much weight I can pull behind my car and go from there.  I am open to any suggestions you all my have!  HELP ME!!!

       "It's easy to fall in love. The hard part is finding someone to catch you."   Ain't that the truth.  You know sometimes I think relationships shouldn't really be that complicated, but when it comes down to it, they really can be.  I don't really know where I am going with is, but I saw this quote and totally agreed.  So that's it.  Today I realized I only have 4 work days left.  It's starting to kind of freak me out.  My friend Nikki made me a list of things I need to start doing.  I made the mistake of telling her I haven't done a thing yet.  She looked at me with that look your mother gives you when you didn't do something she asked you to do.  I really don't know what I am waiting for.  I would like to say I do things better under pressure, but I know that won't be the case with this.  Maybe it hasn't really hit me that I am moving 2,000 miles away.  But I did get a good lead on a job from my sister-in-law, so hopefully I can get a job asap when I get there.  I am not too worried about finding a job, I am a good employee.  Any company would be lucky to have me!    Hey all you people that read my blog, start leaving me some comments!  I need some interaction!  I have kind of alienated my friends here in town.  Maybe I did that so it wouldn't be so hard for me to leave, but mostly it's because we just don't have the same interests anymore.  I am trying to get out of here and start a real life where I am on my own, taking care of myself, while my friends are content being here, living with their parents, going out every weekend and getting wasted.  That's really not so fun for me anymore.  I guess I am just realizing that I am growing up, and that life is not a game, and it's short.  I need to go after the things I want, they are not going to come to me.  Wow, I am getting all philosophical tonight.

      So I have realized that I am extremely paranoid and somewhat insecure about certain things and I really need to work on that.  Last night I was thinking that J was avoiding me, or that something bad happened to him, but really it was just a misunderstanding.  He thought I was going to call him back, and I thought he was going to call me....and it was this whole stupid thing.  So anyway, I need to get over that, quick!    Today was a better day though.  I am so tired all the time now because of the whole time change.  It's dark when I leave work, so I just want to go home and lay down.  I am stressed to the limit right now, and my way of dealing with it is by procrastinating.  I should be doing things, like packing some stuff, or calling about U-Hauls, and planning a route.  But I am overwhelmed by this whole thing, so my way of dealing is by pushing it aside and avoiding it.  Ugh!  I just don't know what I am doing.  Then tonight my Dad starts going on about money, and asking me how much money I have.  I don't know what he and my mom have talked about, but obviously he doesn't know she is going to help me.  But anyway, my stomach has been in knots lately.  I just wish I was there already.  I talked to my sister-in-law last night and she and my brother are going to come up this weekend so I can see the twins before I leave.  That will be a gut wrenching experience.  I love those little guys so much!  I know I will miss all my nephews and nieces terribly.  Ok, I gotta stop now, I am getting all misty!!

       "Having a calm mind is being able to choose how to react."   So I was at Wal-Mart on my lunch today, and I saw the freakiest thing.  Ready for this....?  A man dressed as a woman.  Now a lot of times these men usually look better than us women, but not this one.  He looked like he only put half the effort into it, ya know because he was just running to Wal-Mart or whatever.  But when I saw him/her I did a double take.  I didn't want to stare, but I needed to see this.  He still had kind of a five o'clock shadow thing going on, and he was probably a good 6 feet tall.  And he had this red tank dress on with boots that did not match.  So I practically ran to find my friend Donna so she could look at him.  He kind of resembled Howard Stern a little bit.  Then we found my other friend Bobbi and I sent her over to see him/her as well!  Ok so the kicker is that I saw this person in this small town of Ottawa, in Wal-Mart.  Now if I was in Chicago I wouldn't be shocked at all, but this was just weird.  But it cheered me up because I was in a foul mood today.  I think it's just really bad PMS, and the fact that I haven't talked to J since Saturday.  But that's a whole different story.  He says it's hard for him to talk to me because it makes him miss me, but not talking to him makes me miss him.  It kind of sucks!  But hopefully that will all change in a couple weeks.  I am actually kind of worried because it's really not like him to not return my calls.  And of course my mind starts wandering.  Did he get into some kind of car accident, does he not want to talk to me anymore....what??  I guess I just have to wait it out!  Whatever!

      I feel so overwhelmed and on edge today.  I don't know exactly why.  I think there is a combination of things.  I just got this feeling today like I am really hurting my mom by moving so far away.  She has just been different since I told her I put in my notice at work.  I feel guilty, like I am breaking her heart, and that is breaking my heart.  But I just need to remember that I have to things for myself.  And my mom knows that, she just wishes I wouldn't go so far away.  But I really feel like this is the right decision.  The only downfall is being away from my family.  But plane tickets are cheap when you book in advance.  Everything will be fine!  I am just a huge ball of nerves right now.  I get thinking and I start to feel like I could throw up....hopefully that will pass.    So on to a lighter note.  I had a great time Friday night.  It was fun going out all dressed up.  But my friend Laura told me I looked like a drag queen from the back.  Probably because I had 3 inch boots on.  So I was probably a good 5'9" or 5'10" in the boots.  But it was just fun.  We did get some free drinks, and I can't wait to get my pictures back.  I wish I could post them on here for you all to see.  My friend Jenny dressed up as a toilet.  It was just hilarious!  I haven't that much fun in a long time.

      Ok, first thing I have to say is to Amy.  That is so totally weird that you mentioned that song in your blog, because I have been walking around the apartment singing it.  And we were just talking last night about how all these weird "coincidental" things have been happening lateley.  Weird.  But anyway, yeah, I don't know the name of that song.  I think it's just "I Got the Joy" or something like that.   Shelly and I played beauty shop last night.  I hilighted her hair, and I had fun.  Shelly was worried the whole time, but I promised her it would turn out just fine.  And it did.  But I almost felt like that might be something I would like to do.  But I don't know if it would really be fulfilling to me.  As opposed to working in the medical field.  I guess I will just have to do Shelly's hair all the time.  But anyway, it was fun.  Except Shelly wouldn't sit still.  And I almost blinded her with the stuff.  But other than that it was a success.   We went to Barnes and Noble last night, and I got the cutest little books.  One of them is 650 love questions.  Which I don't know why I buy that kind of shit.  I guess I am just a sucker.  But reading about love and crap like that makes me sad.  But what makes me happy is that Shelly is so in love.  Sometimes it's a little sickening, but it makes me happy to see her happy!  I love ya Shell!  I guess when the time is right it will happen for the rest of us.    And I also got these other two books.  One is called Kokology, and I think it's some sort of Japanese game, tells you about your life and what not.  And the other one is just The Worlds Stupidest Questions, it's pretty funny though.    So anyway, I need to work on a cover letter, so I am out of here.  Need to get a jobby job.

      I don't even know what I want to say today.  I have all these feelings swirling around in my head, and I can't make heads or tails of them right now.  I guess it's a combination of being tired, and bored, and sad, and happy, and disappointed.  I am so up and down all the time.  I hate it.  One minute I am happy and laughing, and the next I just want to cry.  I am like a loose cannon.  But I guess that should just encourage me to really find a job.  I just need some sort of routine.  This is really my only outlet right now, and I am not sure it's working as well as I would like.  I need something right now, but I am not sure what it is.  A therapist possibly??    I did get some more sleep than usual last night.  Saturday night was bad though.  I was still awake when Shelly got up to get ready for church.  I didn't actually fall asleep until 6:20 a.m.  That is ridiculous.  I have been trying to think what could possibly be keeping me up like this.  I am trying to see the psychology in this.  Let me know if any of you have any ideas.  Besides the fact that I am addicted to crossword puzzles, I don't know what it could be.  So we still have no plans for New Years.  I don't know what the hell we are going to do.  But I was thinking I want another tattoo, (don't tell my mom), she would freak.  But anyway, I want to get another one, or at least add to the one I have.  I don't know yet.  So I guess I need to figure out the best place to get one.  I don't want some dirty place, obviously.  Well I am out of here.  I need to go get some laundry detergent.

      Today is a good day.  I got a letter from my old job, and I am getting some cash.  Couldn't have come at a better time.  I was starting to get a little worried about money.  But now I can relax  a little bit.  I am tired today.  Didn't go to bed until 5:00 a.m.  Woke up at 10:30.  That is just not enough sleep for me.  I love sleep too much.    I am sitting in the cafe with Shelly right now, and I brought my journal.  That's for my more private thoughts that I just can't share with all of you.  Sorry, my life isn't an open book, not yet anyway.  So I am just going to sit in here and journal and enjoy the atmosphere or something like that.    I need to go get some more crossword books.  All mine are half done, so I will save those for when I am really bored.  My personal goal is to finish one someday, without cheating.  We'll see if that ever happens.  But I guess I don't really have much to say today.  So I am out of here.

      Well I made it through my first Christmas away from home.  Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  I imagined me just sitting around crying all day, but that didn't happen.  I didn't cry once.  I called home, and everyone was there.  I could hear my little niece in the background, but she couldn't say hi because she had a mouth full of chocolate.  All I heard was a muffled, "Hi Kristi"... so cute.  She was on her way to open presents so she couldn't be bothered.  But that's ok.  I talked to my dad, and he asked me the same 3 questions he always asks me.  1.)  Did you find a job yet?  2.)  Do you need money?  3.)  What are you living on?  I am thinking the next time he asks me if I need money I am just going to say yes.  Of course I may mean it next time.  I just got my first two bills in the mail since I have been here.  Nothing major, but kinf of a reality check.  Vacation is over, bills are coming in, and I need to find a job....soon.  Maybe I should start practicing,"Do you want fries with that?"  or "Thank you, drive around."    I got some more cards in the mail today.  Checking the mail is the hililght of my day right now.  But when I get these cards they make me sad.  My friend Julie sent me one and she told me that she misses me, and things just aren't the same without me around.  How sweet.  Those things are so good to hear.  I miss my friends.  But I guess they will just have to come visit me.  Well I need to go look for some jobs, so hope you all had a Merry Christmas.

      Woke today to the sound of leaf blowers.  I was pissed.  First of all I couldn't sleep last night, as usual.  Finally I fell asleep at probably 4:00 and woke up at 5:30.  So needless to say I am tired today.  I was about to go out and shove the leaf blower up the dudes ass.    Called my mom.  She has all her pies made.  Pumpkin, my favorite, coconut cream, and some cherry dessert.  Oh how I will miss that.  But at least I won't be eating a ton of crap this year.  Shelly, Scott and I are going to the grocery store later, not looking forward to that, but we have to.  We are cooking tomorrow, so that should be fun.    So anyway, not too much going on, Merry Christmas.  Hope you all have a good one.

      Not too much up today....Shelly and Scott are back.  I am an insomniac, and I still kind of want to go home.  So that hasn't changed.  Julie called me today and told me they just filled the other position in my department at my old job.  She wants to know what's going on with me and why I was asking about it.  I just told her I was in one of those moods.  I think I just need to get out and do something, but I don't know what.  I am just tired of sitting in that damn apartment.  I can only go to Target so many times, and the mall is probably a friggin zoo right now, so I better steer clear.    Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, not sure how I am feeling about that right now.  If I can just make it through the next two days, I will be fine.  It's going to be so hard though, and the more I think about it the more nervous I get.  It's like I don't know how to feel.  Part of me wants so badly to just pack it up and go home.  I have so many people telling me that I will regret it, and they're right, but it's this overwhelming feeling.  I can't push it back.  I am sitting here bouncing my leg up and down, that's what I do when I am nervous or upset or whatever.  I am also feeling very anxious because I know that my credit card bills are coming to me next month, and I don't know what to do about that.  I am feeling extremely overwhelmed, did I mention that already.  Kind of like I could have a panic attack at any moment.  I need to relax....deep breaths.  I think I need a drink!  That's what I will do, I will drink tonight!      I just got an e-mail from one of my friends at home.  She's pregnant.  I am so happy for her because she and her husband have been trying for a really long time.  She has gone through a lot, but I knew it would happen for her someday, when the time was right.  What a great Christmas present!!  Well my Mom has the Christmas tree up, but she said she doesn't plug it in.  I guess we have to take one step at a time.  Actually my Dad put it up.  I can see him assembling the thing, but I cannot see him decorating it.  That had to be good.  I wish I were there.

      I experienced my first earthquake today.  How weird.  First of all, I didn't go to bed until 5:30 a.m. and I woke up to the sound of friggin leaf blowers.  I was so annoyed.....but anyway, I was just starting to fall back to sleep and all of a sudden I feel the bed shaking.  Then I look up and I am just thinking, What the hell was that.  The blinds were moving.  And earthquake went through my mind, but I didn't really think it was.  Then I get a text message that says, "Your first earthquake."  I was like no way.  So that's my earthquake story.   I am not looking forward to Christmas at all. I just keep thinking about my house on Christmas morning, my mom baking all sorts of pies, and her homemade bread sitting by the patio door so the warmth from the sunlight would help it rise.  I miss how it would get so hot in the house and we would have a door propped open even though it's 20 degrees out, and all the windows would steam up.  And waiting for everyone to get there, and seeing all my nephews and nieces all excited about opening presents.  Letting them pass out all the presents.  And how the living room was such a mess all day long, with wrapping paper laying everywhere, and piles of presents in different corners of the room.  Sitting around and playing Euchre all day, and me yelling at my brother because we have lost 12 games in a row (he always knows I'm kidding).  All my friends calling to see if I am going out and what time.  Everybody is home and you see people you haven't seen in a long time.  There are tons of people out. I talked to my mom today, and I told her I am giving it one month.  If I don't find a decent job by then I am coming home.  Why am I torturing myself??  When will I stop thinking about going home, and focus on having a life here.  Maybe I just don't belong here.  Maybe this is not what I am supposed to be doing.  Maybe, maybe, maybe.    It's amazing how lonliness can sneak up on you.  Last night I was sitting on the couch doing a crossword puzzle watching Titanic, and all of sudden I was just crying.  All I could think about was being home.  Sundays are hard for me for some reason.  I am not sure why.  They always have been.  Maybe it will be better when Shelly and Scott get back.  I like my alone time, but I think I have had too much time to think the last couple days.  With the risk of sounding cheesy, I really feel like a lost soul right now.  I feel like I am just kind of floating around out there, wondering what the hell I am supposed to be doing.

      I am on the verge of packing up my bags and going home.  I really don't know what I was thinking.  I left a job that I did very well and knew a lot about, and had potential to move up to come here and make less money and pay more bills.  What the hell was I thinking?  I think I was just being naive.  Thinking I could come here and get a good job and be just fine.  Well I'm not fine.  I have pretty much put myself out there, professionally and socially and I am just not getting the results I had hoped for.  I understand I have only been here a month, but this is turning out to be the worst month of my life.  And how do I know when I have given it enough time.  I didn't get the job that I interviewed for, which is kind of a disappointment.  I kind of knew I wasn't going to get it, she never asked me any questions.  She didn't know what my qualifications were, and she didn't care.  She knew who she wanted to hire.  I guess I will never get used to the politics of job hunting.   And then I think what will I do if I go home.  I will be happy at my job, but the rest of my life will still be the same.  So what do I do?  I wish someone could just tell me what to do.    I am talking to my friend's daughter right now.  She is ten years old, and she is so cute.  She just told me that her and her mom got me a Christmas present.  I almost started crying.  I guess you don't realize how much you're friends love you sometimes.  I love Julie, she is one of my friends that I can be a total bitch with, and she knows that I am just moody sometimes.  She knows when to leave me alone, and I know when to leave her alone.  We just have those understandings.  And I never expected her to get me a Christmas present.    Then I get a text message from John last night.  He said he was sorry, and that he was out of town.  I was like,"yeah whatever."  I just ignored it.  Then he sent another one, and another one, and another one.  I just kept ignoring them because I wanted him to know how it felt.  Obviously he didn't like it too much.  So the last one he sent said, "whatever then", so of course for some reason I felt bad.  Even though he is the one that has been treating me like shit the last two weeks, I felt bad.  So I responded.  Asked him if we could talk tonight, but of course he can't.  What else is new?  He said he has to work all weekend.  Whatever.    I am not doing well today at all.  I just sat in the middle of the bathroom floor crying today.  All I want to do right now is go home.  And figure shit out then I guess.  I really don't think I can do this.  As much as I hate to say it.  And Shelly, I'm sorry, maybe God just brought me here to make me realize that I was fine where I was.  I don't know.    This morning I woke up hearing a cat meowing.  I looked out the window but I didn't see the cat anywhere.  Then I opened the door, still no cat.  I have no idea where it was, for a minute I thought it might actually be in the apartment.  That's how close it sounded.  So I don't know where it was.

      I had an interview today.  Not really what I expected.  I was ready to go in there and answer all sorts of questions about my work experience and all that, but she just told me about the job, asked me what I like to do when I am not working, and asked me if I had any questions.  It seems like a cool job.  Doesn't pay much, of course, but I guess I need to start somewhere.    I didn't sleep well last night....again.  I put in a movie, but I just wasn't tired.  So then I played some Free Cell, and I still wasn't tired.  Then I woke up at 3:30, and I did that count.  If I fall asleep now, I can still get 4 hours of sleep.  My alarm went off and I really did not want to get up.  It's so cold in the morning.  I just wanted to stay under the blankets.  But I feel good now.  It's nice to get up early and get things done.  I went to my interview, and then forced myself to go to the grocery store.  I didn't know where to go considering every place is on strike, so I went to damn Foods Co.  First of all, I always get a bunk cart, and I put a case of bottled water in it, and that threw everything off.  I could barely push the damn thing once I got my water and soda in it.  Yeah I said "soda".  So I was going to get some meat.  Some chicken and hamburger.  But I never end up buying it.  I hate buying meat.  I don't know why either.  So I get all my stuff, and I wanted some cottage cheese.  I look at the date on it, and it says, "sell by dec 14".....um hello, it's the friggin 18th.  So I decided that was the last time I go there.  I'll cross the damn picket lines if it means I can get fresh cottage cheese.  And the other day when Scott bought some cheese, it was moldy already.  So the old cottage cheese is the last straw.  And I forgot half the stuff I needed.    Being here alone is getting easier by the day.  I thought for sure I was going to lose it, but I think I am ok.  I talked to some friends last night, and that definitely helps.  I talked to my mom, and she seems to be doing better.  I told her I would be home soon to visit....I don't know how soon, but I will get there.  So anyway, I am going home to eat lunch.

      My first day all alone.  I think I am doing ok.  At first when I got back into town I was a little depressed, and really wanting to go home.  I even looked up plane tickets last night to see how much it would cost me to fly home for Christmas.  Obviously it's a little late to be trying to plan that, but I thought I would check it out.  I cried a little bit last night, but it passed.  I came home and started cleaning, did some laundry, watched some t.v., did some crossword puzzles.  I kept myself pretty busy.  Shelly called me when they landed.  She said it was really cold, and starting to snow.    So I left John two voice messages last night, and sent him a text message.  I want to be done with all of this, and he will not return my call.  I do not understand it.  Why won't he just call me back so it can be over?  I guess I just don't understand men.  I think I will just give up on the whole thing, men all together and focus on myself for awhile, which is what I should have been doing all along.  I should never have gotten involved with him in the first place.  It only complicated things.  I am just going to work on finding a job, getting back into school, and making sure I am happy.  Screw everyone else.    I made it back from the airport ok.  The traffic sucked, but it was ok.  That's not a fun drive though.  I was all nervous about getting lost, but I did fine.  It took me over two hours to get home though.  But it's cool.

      Alright, I am doing a little better today.  Last night Shelly, Scott and I went to the mall and to Target.  That was enough to make me feel better in itself, but then I was in this crazy mood, and just being a huge dork.  But I don't care because it made me feel better.  But I guess the whole John situation is bothering me more than I am letting on.  I sent him two text messages this week and have yet to get a response.  The last one I told him to come get his shit.  If he doesn't come and get that camera, I am pawning it.  I don't want to look at that crap anymore.  But the biggest thing is, why does he think he can just ignore me?  I mean did I mean that little to him, that he can just blow me off?  I guess I am more pissed off about that than anything.  Nobody puts Kristi in the corner....haha!!  Shelly will get that.  Never mind, I am retarded and I need to get out of this cafe.   Shelly and Scott are leaving today.  I don't want them to go.  What the hell am I going to do for a week, all alone?  I bought a crossword puzzle book, and an electronic free cell game.  I have a couple magazines, and a few books I could start reading I guess.  But I hate sitting around.  I would rather be out doing crap.  I guess I would walk my happy ass over to the fitness center and workout for a couple hours a night.  That would make me feel a ton better.  I have a job interview on Thursday, and I am not really excited about it.  I know it's not going to pay shit, and I am probably going to end up working 3 jobs just to live here.  I guess that would be a good thing, then I wouldn't have so much time to think.  I think way too much.  And worry too!  But that's my nature.  I can't help it.  So I gotta go, I gotta get Shelly and Scott to the airport.  Wish me luck!  Hope I make it back ok.

      I WANT TO GO HOME!  I hate to say it, I really do.  But right now I wish I were sitting at my desk at my old job bitching about how stupid everyone is.  Or walking around doing nothing like I so often did.  Or sitting at Bobbi's desk gossipping about people.  Or hanging out in the mailroom pretending to work.  I guess it's really more of a comfort level at this point, but I sometimes wish I had never left that place.  I am just really hoping I will have that comfort level here someday.  I know I say I want to go home, but of course I'm not.  I have my pride.  I just couldn't go home already.  I have to try this, and I am not giving it a fair shot.  Last night was just really hard.  Sundays are so depressing for some reason.  I layed on the couch all day yesterday, and finally at 8:00, I couldn't take it anymore.  I got up, put my shoes on, and left.  I went to check out where this place was that I had to be today, and then I went to Target.  Only when I got to Target, I didn't feel like being there.  Then on the way home from Target I cried.  I am such a weepy pathetic mess sometimes.  But when I got home Shelly cheered me up of course.  We were in her room, and she was trying on shit, and then we were putting on these stocking hats, and scarves, and just being retarded.  So that made me feel better.    I have to take them to the airport tomorrow.  That makes me so nervous.  I'm always so scared of getting lost.  And who would I call if I did get lost, or my car broke down, or I got a flat tire.  I am such a girl, I don't even know how to change a tire.  I should probably learn.  I'm sure none of those things will happen, but what if?  I am going to be here for a week all by myself.  I am kind of scared about that too.  Who will I talk to?  I will be making a lot of phone calls I think.  I am going to be lonely.  Oh well, I will deal I guess.

      Saturday afternoon.  I'm tired.  Just got done playing a game of Trivial Pursuit that we started last night.  I hate that game.  I don't know why I suggested playing.  I always end up feeling stupid.  I really need to keep up on current events.  I don't even like to guess because then I just feel more stupid.  But I was among friends so it's ok.    I have been getting the worst headaches the last couple days.  I don't know if they are stress related, or if I just need to have an adjustment.  My back has been kind of jacked up the last few months, but I didn't want to go to the chiropractor and pay $40.00.  Oh well.  I'll survive I guess.    My dad called me last night.  I missed his call because my phone didn't even ring, but he left me a message.  Just checking in on me because he hadn't heard from me in awhile.  I don't want to call back, because what I really want to tell him is that I am not doing that well, that the guy he thought was going to help me when I was here is being a jackass, and that I miss him.  And I just can't cry on the phone with him.  I can't!  And everytime I think about my dad, I just wish I was closer with him before I left.  I can't even write in this blog without crying.  Ugh, and now my sister in law just called me.  I didn't really feel like talking so I let it go to voice mail.  I could hear my little twin nephews in the background.  I miss them so much.  They are absolutely the cutest little boys I have ever seen in my life.  And the funniest kids too.  I just love kids!!!  Awe!!     I am going to church tomorrow.  Shelly is such a good influence on me.....well most of the time anyway.  Plus I just want to hear her sing.  Shelly can you just sing me to sleep every night?  Get this girl a record deal.  My dad would be so happy to know I am going to church.  I will be sure to tell him.  Alright, I gotta get outta here.  Check ya later!!!  Shelly!  Ooooh you're damn right!  HEHE!!!

      My knee still hurts.  Scott said I couldn't go ice skating with my bad knee, but it's feeling a little better!  I want to go!  I have a new favorite game show.  The Family Feud.  Scott and I sit there and just make fun of some of these answers people give.  It's so funny.  I want to go on the Family Feud.  The commericials that I see on T.V. right now are terrible.  But I still haven't seen a Get Bus commercial.  But there's this one that I know Scott loves where this lady says,"Yesterday my phone got "chut" off."  It's hilarious.  Everytime I see it I just look at Scott and wait for the look of disdain on his face.  It's almost the same look as when he hears Puddle of Mud or Stained, of Dickel Back as he likes to call them.  HAHA!!    I have to go to another staffing place on Monday.  I need to find a job soon.  If I don't, I have a feeling that I might end up sitting on the couch watching Jerry Springer.  That would be rock bottom for me.  But I have come up with a whole new plan.  I just have to get my parents to take the bait.  Tell me what all of you think.  I want to go back to school for Radiology full time, and get a part time job to cover my rent, car payment and insurance.  I would take out school loans for tuition, but ask my mom very nicely to cover my other bills until I get finished.  How's that sound?  I mean she is actually getting off a lot cheaper than if I asked her to pay for my school.  She paid for two years of IVCC, but that's nothing.  So basically I am cutting her a deal.  Six kids and only one of them who wants to go to college?  That's chump change to her.  I think it sounds like a sweet deal.  But we will see what she has to say.  I will keep you posted.  Cross your fingers for me.  Ok, I am about to freak out in here.  It's so loud.  First there are two asian women speaking their native language.  I could never, ever live in a foreign country.  It would drive me crazy.  Then there is this lady in here talking to a baby, and if her voice gets any higher I think my ear drums may shatter.  I mean she is up in the dog whistle tones.  Shut up!!!  She is like one of those cheesy nice people, that are always like HIIIII!!!!  and THAAAANK YOU.....and you just want to tell her to shut up and stop being so damned nice.  Then she was saying how quiet the baby was.  Obviously she blocked out it's crying for 20 minutes.  I need a nice quite library to sit in and play on the computer.  Or better yet, I need my own computer.  Donations are being accepted at this time.  Ok, I am done venting.  Did I medicate myself today???  I think so!  What the hell??

      I had somewhat of a breakdown this morning.  I saw John today because he finally came to get his car.  And seeing him just put me in a foul mood.  That's not a good sign.  So that was that, we didn't really talk, I just told him to call me when he gets home from work.  But we all know by now that won't happen.  I just want this to be done.  But we won't get into it right now.  I called my mom today and I could barely talk to her.  I was almost in tears, just about everything.  I have my days, but today was bad.  I didn't think I was going to be able to stop crying.  I just wasn't feeling strong today, I told my mom I wanted to come home.  I shouldn't have said that.  She just told me to keep my chin up.  Then she told me a story about my 4 year old niece and I was cracking up.  That's the stuff I miss.    Funny story.  Last night Shelly and I went to get some movies, and I wanted popcorn, but when I got home I realized it was Kettle corn, and I just wasn't in the mood for that.  I wanted something really buttery, so I made her take me back to the store.  We were outside looking at Christmas trees, and I totally tripped over some cement slap and twisted my knee.  How stupid is that?  Yeah I hurt myself looking at trees.    I ate so much sugar last night.  I don't know what it was.  I just wanted sugar.  But anyway, we watched movies last night.  Well I actually watched about 4 movies, because I am an insomniac.  Pirates of the Caribbean.  Good movie.  At first I was a little weirded out about Johnny Depp, but then I was pleasantly surprised.  He was really good in this movie.  Then we watched Old School, and then I watched Serendipity, and then I watched Pulp Fiction, but I fell asleep through that.    So one thing I love about California, is all the bathrooms have toilet seat covers.  I love that.  In Illinois you were lucky to find a bathroom with those things.  Public bathrooms are just so disgusting.  I hate them.  We were in Wal-Mart today and I had to pee, so I went in, and I just cringed.  But I opened one of the stalls and there is the toilet seat cover dispenser!  Thank you soooo much!    Ok, I gotta go, I am rambling on about nothing.

      I seriously cannot take anymore.  I'm done!  Men are a pain in the ass, and I don't have the time or the energy anymore.  So referencing the story I told earlier, John sent me another text message telling me he would call me first thing in the morning.  No!  Why bother??  It's 7:30, and he's hung over, but that is not my fault.  I wasn't the one who went out last night and got all liquored up.  But for some reason I am the one who is suffering.  So I suppose he is going to call me all early in the morning to do something with his car, and I will be there to help because I am a nice person.  Well guess what.  I am done being nice, and I am going to start looking out for #1.  At first, I really thought it was going to be something good with us, but now I am realizing that's not the case.  So I just thought I would vent about that for a minute, and now I am out of here.

      Ok, so I have a funny story.  And I am still hoping that a certain person does not read this.  So I was just falling asleep last night, or this morning rather, and my phone rings.  It's John, and he's drunk, and leaving the casino.  Why exactly does Bakersfield need a casino anyway?  So I am trying to talk to him, and it's obviously not going too well, because as I mentioned, he's drunk.  He's telling me he is coming over, and I am like yeah ok.  So eventually I give up and we hang up.  I get a call this morning, and John is in the parking lot of my apartment with a dead battery and a flat tire.  I have no idea what he did, but he was supposedly coming to see me.  Guess he didn't make it as far as he had planned.  I told him he deserved it, and then he accused me of coming out there and slashing his tire.  Yeah, if I had known he was out there, maybe, but it was not me.  So anyway, that's a funny story, and I laugh every time I think about it.  HAHA!!  See I am laughing right now!  Hey Kathy!  Shelly told me you have been reading my blog.  Sweet!  So how are you?  Shelly keeps telling me you miss your fave daughter.  I am doing well.  I miss my family and my friends, but other than that, I am doing just fine.  Thanks so much for asking.  I don't think I call home often enough, but it's just because it's still hard to talk to my mom.  But I am sure you know how it is.  So anyway, come visit us or something, bring my mom.  I am sure you are due for a vacation.  It's probably been a couple weeks.  Hey love ya!!

      I don't have much to report today.  I stay up late reading, I sleep in, and I feel like a bum.  I didn't shower until after 2:00 today.  I am reading a book, and right now I can't put it down.  The Bell Jar.  Very good, and I recommend it.  It's by Syliva Plath.    So I can't believe how much I have been sleeping lately.  After I showered and got dressed today, I layed back on the couch and started reading again.  I fell asleep reading for an hour or so.  Oh, I need a job so bad.  I am going to call tomorrow if I don't hear anything in the morning.  Maybe I will go to Target and see if they are hiring.  I will at least fill out the app online.  Might not be a good idea to work there, but I need something.    Well I don't have anything else today.  Probably because I didn't do anything.  But Shelly and Scott leave a week from today, and they will be gone for a week.  What am I going to do?  I am going to be bored and lonely.  Oh well, hopefully I will have a job by then.  Call me people.

      Hey people.  Back at the cafe, it's Monday.  I have things to do today, but I just really wish I had a job at this point.  I couldn't sleep last night.  I think it's because I know I have absolutely nothing to get up for.  I have never been in this situation before.  I am starting to feel like a bum.  But I guess I need to be patient.  But last night, I just really wished I was in my old room, in my own bed.  I am sure you are all so sick of hearing this.  So I will move on.    Snails.....they are everywhere when it rains.  Saturday night I stepped on one and I almost started to cry.  It was the grossest thing.  I just stepped backward, and I heard this snapping kind of popping noise, which was the shell.  And then you just see this pile of mush sitting there.  I felt terrible.  Ugh!  It was gross.  So anyway, last night Shelly and I left to go to Target, and I stepped on one, and then she stepped on one, and she screamed like a girl.  It was nasty.  I was just hoping I wouldn't step on anymore.  We put up some Christmas lights last night.  We are doing some more tonight.  It looks cool so far.  We just need to get a tree.   So the one subject that has been weighing on my mind is John.  I actually talked to him and spent time with him on Saturday.  I think I may be more confused now than I was before.  He told me he does want to be with me and he likes spending time with me, but he's going through something and he needs time.  Ok, that's fine, but I can't have this inconsistent relationship.  And I can't understand why he won't tell me what it is.  How am I supposed to understand when I have no idea what it is?   And if is has nothing to do with me, then why is it affecting me so much.  I don't know what to do.  I want to be with him, but I think I need to take care of myself first, and this is not fair to me.  How can I just sit back and wait for him to get through something, and then just be there for him when he's ready?  Whatever.  I don't know what to do.  So I am reading the Bell Jar right now.  I can't wait to get home and read some more of it.  It's really good so far, and I have been wanting to read it.  I have that book, and three others that I need to read.  Shelly was making fun of Scott and I because we were lying on the couches reading.  She took a picture of us reading.  And she called us dorks!  HAHA!!

      Saturday afternoon, I am sitting at the cafe again.  They are playing Christmas music.  It's kind of bittersweet.  I love Christmas, but I am trying to forget that it's the hoidays, and I am so far away from home.  I would so love to go home for Christmas, but I just know it's too soon.  I have a feeling I would stay if I went home.  So anyway, I am going to try and forget that it's Christmas.  Shelly and I went out last night to the Rockin Rodeo.  Country on one side, hip hop on the other.  It's kind of like a mullet.  Business in the front, party in the back.  So anyway, it was a good time.  There was this one dude up on the upper level just gettin busy with himself.  It was quite humorous.  I couldn't help myself, at one point, I just straight up pointed and laughed at him.  I mean he was humping the ground, and dancing on the railing, and all sorts of crazy stuff.  But I had a good time.  I needed to get out of the apartment, I think I am going crazy there.  I need a jobby job....soon.    Latest update on the John situation.  I just sent him a text message last night that said, "I get it.  Will you call me so we can be done with this."  At this point, I am more pissed at his lack of respect for me, and his lack of maturity.  I mean how ridiculous.  What do I need to do to get him to call me so I can just be done with this.  But I really just want some answers.  I don't miss him anymore, I don't want to be with him anymore, I just want to know why he thinks he can treat me this way.  That's what I want.  And my playstation back!!  Bastard!

      Alright, here I am again.  I am frustrated and I am mad, but you know what?  It's not worth it.  I have decided that I am worth much more than some guy treating me like I am nothing.  I think I deserve a little more respect than what I am getting.  So therefore, I am through.  I am sure there are plenty of other guys out there.  I am taking care of myself from here on out.    So that's enough on that subject.  I called my mom last night, and everytime I call her it gets worse.  I asked her if she had the Christmas tree up yet, and she said no and that she wasn't going to put it up.  I am worried about her.  I mean she never really loved Christmas, but once I got the tree out and started putting it up she would come around.  But she said that I usually put it up, and I am not there.  I told her that's why she should put it up.  Then I told her I was going to go, and that I would call her later this week.  I think she was crying.  It breaks my heart that I am putting her through this, but I have to do this for myself.  And I wanted to tell her about John, but I just couldn't because I knew I would start crying, and I don't like people to see me cry.  Not even my mom.  So I just skipped that little detail.  I just want to know that it will get easier for her.  I understand that I am the youngest and I just moved 2,000 miles away, but when will that not be so hard for her?    Well I slept in Shelly's bed again last night, and I am happy to report she kept her hands to herself.  Oh how I miss my bed.  I miss my room.  I miss my house.  But, that will all pass I suppose.    Hey Amy, when you are in town, have a beer for me.  I really don't miss Streator.  Not at all.  But it sucks that I won't be there to hang out with you.  Go see my mom or something.   I need to make sure she is doing ok.  How do you talk to your dad all the time when you know he is going to cry?  When does it get easier??  I need some advice.  And thanks for your words of encouragement on the John situation.  I am not even upset anymore, I am just pissed off, and that makes it so much easier to break it off with him.    But on a happier note, it's Friday, and we are going out tonight.  So I am kind of excited about that.   Bye!

      Ok, so I am more confused today about John than I was the other day.  So he finally called, and he asked me to come over for dinner, and go see a movie.  So of course I did because I wanted to see him, and find out what the hell was up.  And he acted like everything was just fine, and I was the one that was crazy for being concerned.  Which only concerns me more.  So I thought things were kind of ok, but then yesterday he sends me a message telling me he wants to go out for drinks, and then he tells me he's running late, and then he tells me he will call me when he gets home.  He never called.  I think that constitutes a stand up.  Why is it ok to tell me you will call, and then just not call.  Then he turns his phone off.  Now let's take a poll.  How many of you say, "Another Woman"?  Maybe I am jumping to conclusions.  Don't know.  Guess I will find out soon enough.  So I am waiting to hear on two jobs.  I went to a temp agency, which I really didn't want to do, but it turned out better than I thought.  One is for a medical office, and the other is for a law office.  The job at the law office is word processing which I know can be boring, but there is room for advancement to a legal secretary, which is something I have been interested in.  I actually wanted to go to school to be a paralegal.  So who knows.  Keep your fingers crossed.  I have a funny story about Shelly!  Being the good friend she is, she let me sleep in her bed last night since I had to get up early.  See I usually sleep on the couch.  So I am laying there trying to fall asleep when I feel a hand on my back.  Then later a hand on my head.  Now I don't know who Shelly thought was lying next to her, but she made her move.  She thought I was sleeping so she didn't laugh or say anything, and I thought she was sleeping too.  I asked her about it this morning.  It was pretty funny.  Actually that's the most I have been touched in awhile!  Thanks Shelly!!!!

      Just have one question today.  Why do men suck?  One day you think everything is fine and dandy and the next thing you know you haven't talked to someone who is supposed to be your boyfriend in 5 days.  Yes people, 5 days.  The man who flew to Illinois to see me twice, and drove cross country with me, all of a sudden is ignoring me.  I can't even find out why, becuase the jag won't call me.  Now I am not sure what I did, and I can't even begin to imagine.  Apparently his feelings have just changed???  I don't know.  But it sucks because I really thought he was going to be there for me.  He was great when I first got here.  We went to the grocery store, he cooked dinner for us, we played cards, we hung out, he helped me get a new cell phone.  I went to his house for Thanksgiving, and that was the last time I saw him.  I am completely baffled.  And not really sure how to feel.  One minute I just say Fine, screw him, and the next I am sad, because I really like him and love spending time with him.  But I guess if he doesn't want to be with me, then there isn't much I can do about it.  I guess I will move on.  So I got a package from my mom today.  She sent me my jackets and some jeans that I forgot.  Can you believe I could forget jeans.  There my favorite piece of clothing.  But anyway, I almost started crying.  I hate that I am so emotional right now.  It sucks.  I called home last night, and my mom told me that my Dad was worried because I haven't called.  It's so funny to hear that, my Dad and I were never that close.  Now he tells me everytime I talk to him that if it doesn't work out here, that I can always come home.  He makes sure I know that.  Sometimes I feel like I want to go home, but I know if I did that I would feel like a failure.  Especially since I haven't given it much of a chance.  I mean I haven't even gotten a job yet.  Speaking of which I need to get on that, so I am out of here.

      Well I have been here a week now, and I am really kind of sad and depressed.  I have convinced myself that I will not a find a good job here, and that I would be happier if I went back home.  I don't really know what to do.  I miss my family and my friends, and I feel like I could cry at the drop of a hat.  Now it could be PMS, but either way, I don't know how to get over it.  And not to sound like a mama's girl, but I miss my mom a lot.  I want to call her right now but I am afraid I will start crying on the phone.  I know I just need to give it time, but I am not feeling very strong right now.  I guess I just need to suck it up and get a job.  But then I worry that once I get a job, I won't make enough to support myself.  Can I worry and doubt anymore?  I need to relax.....I need a pep talk I think.    Ok, and as if people don't already know I am not from around here, I totally screwed up a car wash yesterday.  I put my money in and proceeded to pull forward.  Scott was with me but he had run into the gas station, and left me alone to fend for myself.  So I pull in but I pulled up too far, and the thing started to spray soap on my car, and that's all it did.  So I sat there like an idiot waiting for it to do something else.  Well it never did.  So I pulled out, with half my car covered in soap, and pulled back around to try it again.  I felt like such an idiot.  I paid $6.00 for a $3.00 carwash!  I was pissed.   And now my car isn't even that clean.  I need to get out and really clean it.    I am just not right these last few days.  My brain feels like mush.  I need some intellectual stimulation.  I need a jobby job.

      Alright, so I guess I can still blog on this site too!  It's just not as fun as the other one.  But anyway, nothing really going on.  I am still jobless, and getting really tired of it.  I am wrestling with the decision to bring the rest of my stuff out here.  I am not sure if that's the kind of committment I want to make at this point.  If I bring all my furniture out here and still can't get a job, then what am I going to do?  Then I have to haul all that crap home.  But Shelly presented a point to me last night and I have been going over it in my head all day.  If I am still here in July then we are moving out of the aparment and hopefully getting a house, and that would be really cool, but I can't say that I am still going to be here.  I just have absolutely no idea what I am doing.  Like I haven't said that a million times!  But I think I just have this huge fear of committment.  I don't like to commit to things!  That could pose a problem in the future.  Oh well.  So anyway, doesn't sound like a huge decision to people, but to me I can't decide what to do.  Part of me wants my bed and my furniture here so it will feel a little more like home, but then I feel that if I get all that stuff here, then I will have to stay here.  I'm not sure I want that.  So anyway, that's my dilema.

      I am not to excited about blogging anymore, I have a new site and it's way cooler.  I think I might just scrap this whole blog thing and just post on the other one.  But I don't know yet.  Maybe I will keep this one as my G-rated site, and the other one will be for me to really let go on.  You know, when I am really mad about things and what not.  Haven't decided yet.    But I have to vent about this though.  If I wake up one more morning to the sound of chainsaws, I am going to wig out!  I didn't go to bed until 3:30 this morning and at 7:51 I wake up and hear chainsaws, right outside.  I mean the branches are falling and hitting the building.  The walls are so thin in this place anyway, and all I can hear are tree branches.  Oh, I was sooooo mad.  So I think I might have fallen back to sleep for a little while but not for long.  You know, Monday is maintenance day.  Today is Tuesday!  And it wasn't even 8:00 yet.  Ok, well I can't stress how mad I was, but anyway, moving on.  Cheesy soap actors.  Do any of you watch Days of Our Lives?  Hello!!  Stupid.  I used to watch it all the time because my mom watched it everyday.  Back then it was sort of normal, but then Marlena was posessed by the devil, and it just went downhill from there.  And now, they are putting on a circus in Salem, and there is a serial killer on the loose.  Oh my!!  And all these actors and actresses are so cheesy.  I mean there are bad plots, but with good actors.  But this is a bad plot, and bad actors.  Why is this soap still on the air?  Do that many people watch it?

      You would not believe how much food I ate yesterday.  We went to this buffet after church and it was good.  And I just kept eating.  Thank you mom for the high metabolism.  I figured as long as I still had room in my pants that I could keep eating.  Well they had the best chicken salad, and I usually don't like all that crap they put in it, but it was so good!  Ok, so then we came home and all took naps, our apartment is like a rest home on Sundays.  I took a good 4 hour nap yesterday.  Then I got up and Shelly had made cakes for a birthday, and me loving chocolate the way I do, had to lick the spoons and the frosting and all that.  No wonder my stomach hurt last night.  Oh well.  Then I had some pizza, and some Doritos, and some other things, and some coffee with whipped cream on it.  MMMMM it was all good, but then after I ate all that stuff I felt horrible.  It's so weird how food can affect you like that.  But it's PMS and that makes it ok.  I called my mom today, and she jumped all over my back.  I don't know what her deal is, but it's starting to bother me.  First of all, she asked me why my dad got two letters?  I told her I was sending them both letters, and I forgot I had sent my dad another letter thanking him for sending me money.  I don't know if she knows he sent me money, so I didn't really know what to tell her.  But she didn't get the one I sent her yet, so now she's on the defense.  Then she asked me why I called Nancy instead of her about the computer problems they were having yesterday.  I told her Nancy called me and I was returning her call, and she called while I was on the phone with Nancy.  Geez!!  I couldn't believe she was acting like that.  I asked her if she was going to be pissed off all the time.  I don't know what is wrong with her, and I feel like I don't know how to talk to her.  I hate when she is like this.  She is just grumpy all the time.  You know, she really has nothing to be grumpy about.  She got rid of all her kids, which I thought most parents wanted to do.  She can do whatever she wants all day long, she doesn't have to work, she can sew, or crochet, or do whatever all day long.  I wish I could do that....well I guess I can now, but she can do it and not have to worry about money or anything like that.  My parents are financially set, and the only reason my dad works right now is because he is bored, and not ready to be retired.  What is there to be grumpy about??    I have decided to really work hard this week and get a job.  I made a list last night of all the things I was going to check on today, and I am checking them all off.  I was really going to just go home, but I thought about it and that's just not an option right now.  I am here and I am going to make this work.  I decided to just give it to God and let him guide me.  And I guess if I am not supposed to be here then I will never get a job.  But Shelly is convinced that I should be here, so I guess I will give it some more time.  But last night I was sitting on the couch and I just got this sick feeling in my stomach.  My car payment is coming up because obviously my parents can't support me forever, and I have no job.  And I am embarrassed to even say how much my car payment is.  It's ridiculous.  But I just had to have a new car.  But anyway, I felt physically sick, and I started to panick.  It's like I have to talk myself down when I do that.  I seriously have to calm myself down, and I have to make lists and put everything into perspective.  Then I have to tell myself I can do it.  I may have to work three jobs, but then, what else do I have to do really?  So three jobs might be good.  And I honestly can't wait to go back to school.  NERD!  But I have to.  That is the only way I am going to be able to make some real money.  Ok, well I guess I have rambled on enough.

      Here is my random thought today.  I love to sing in my car.  I turn the music up and belt out the tunes, so how come when you pull up at a stoplight you stop singing?  I mean doesn't everyone do this?  Why do I have to be ashamed to let someone see me singing?  They can't hear me.  And they will probably never see me again.  Why do I care?   Another random thought, my sister can't spell!  I am talking to her online right now, and sometimes I have no idea what she is trying to say to me!  Also guys only lead to disappointment....well so far anyway!

      I just priced a flight and all it would cost me to fly home for 9 days is $181.00.  That is cheap!  I am just researching the prices right now.  I just got off the phone with my sister in law and they are all at my parents house.  Kids running around everywhere, and I wish I were there.  Sitting around the table playing games all day.  My sister in law keeps getting on my case about going to Home Depot and applying there.  She's a manager there and she keeps telling me I need to go in and apply.  I really should, and I don't have a good reason why I haven't.  So I guess I will go do that this week.    I went to the mall last night and purchased a few things.  Why does shopping always make me feel so much better.  New clothes always lift my spirits.  And buying smaller sizes does too!  I love it!    I talked to my dad last night.  Everytime I talk to him he asks me if I got a job yet.  Um hello!!  He would be one of the first people to know.  Like I would not tell him if I had a job.  I told him I was on my way home back to Illinois.  He believed me for a minute.  I wish!

So anyway, I cried or something and then left.  But of course he came back!  So weird.  And did I mention my dream about Ashton Kutcher?  I think I did.  What's with my dreams about celebs?  I don't know.  Last night in our small group discussion Shelly wanted us to think of people we thanked God for.  I actually thank God for all of my friends and family, but the three people I wrote letters to were Shelly, my mom and my dad.  My dad has probably never gotten so much mail in his life.  It's so weird how moving all this way has made us closer.  When I lived at home I thought my Dad could care less what was going on in my life.  We just didn't have the best relationship.  We didn't fight or anything, we just didn't really talk much!  Now he is being my dad.  And I want to cry when I think about him.  He sent me money, and I would never had asked him for money before.  He always makes sure to tell me that I can come home.  And to save enough money to make it there.  My dad is just the type of person who would give you the shirt of his back.  He is always there for all of us.  And I just hope that I can be like him someday.  I mean everything except for doing silly things like flooding the basement.  HAHA!!  I just pray to God that him and my mom could just get along.  I know being married for 48 years is a long time, and that you might get tired of someone, but I just wish they could be civil to each other.  I want them both to be happy.  My mom talks all sorts of crazy things, and something she said the other day made me cry so hard, and I had to get off the phone with her.  Then I called my brother and told him about it.  He gave me all this great advice, but it's so hard to be so far from my family.  I always think about the bad things, like what would I do if something happened to one of my parents.  But I guess I can't live my life like that.  Otherwise I would never really live!  Ok, I just realized that at the beginning of this post I said I didn't have anything to say.  HAHA!  Guess I was wrong.

      Ok, now that it has taken me an hour to fix my stupid blog, I can blog now.  I am about to scrap the whole thing.  I got my comments fixed I think, and my links back, so hopefully it will stay that way for awhile.  When I was putting my sea monkey link back, I remembered I have no idea how my sea monkeys are doing?  I wonder if they are still alive.  I left them with a friend at work.  So I will have to check in with her on them.    I don't really have much to say,  everything is pretty much the same.  I talked to one of my twin nephews last night, and I started crying on the phone.  I am such a baby!  But hearing his little voice and hearing him say, "Hi Kristi", it was just so cute.  He was telling me all about the book he was reading, and how it had a big truck on the front.  They are going to be at my parents house this weekend and I so badly wish I could be there.  I miss my family so much, I don't know how often I can say that, but I really really do.  Sometimes it almost feels unnatural to be so far from them.  I can't wait to see them again.  I guess it will be soon enough.

      Ok, I think I might have fixed my comments.  I don't know thought, we'll see I guess.  So not much going on.  I still have no job, but have gone to another placement agency.  I am really hoping this one works out for me.  I guess I just need to keep trying.    Shelly and I went to the beach on Saturday.  It was nice to get away for awhile.  It was a little chilly, but it was cool to say we went to the beach in January.  It's 13 degrees in Illinois.  I called my mom to let her hear the waves.  I talked to her today too, and my parents are falling apart there.  My mom told me that my dad flooded the basement yesterday because he was trying to fix something and didn't get the pipes back in right or something, and the washing machine just kept running because it wasn't filling up.  I was cracking up.  And my mom is talking crazy, saying things she shouldn't be.  So now I am worried about her, and have to call her everyday to check in on her.

      I don't think I can cry anymore.  I cry because I am sad, I cry because I am tired, I cry because I want to go home.  I am starting to really worry about finding a job, I should have one by now.  This is not right.  So I had a really bizarre dream last night.  I dreamt I was getting married.  It was the day of the wedding and I was in my dress with my hair done and everything, but the groom was John.  I was running around and I kept remembering all these little details that I forgot to do.  And then my hair was getting all messed up and I was freaking out.  Then right before I was supposed to walk down the aisle I realized that I was just going to end up getting divorced, and I started to really freak out.  But in the dream I accepted that fact.  And I did it anyway.  So not like me!  So if that's any indication of the relationship..... Then suddenly Ashton Kutcher was there, and we were punking someone.  So weird!  I don't really remember too much about that part of the dream.   I talked to my Dad last night, and I broke down on the phone with him.  Why is it so hard to try to talk and choke back tears at the same time.  I am just the type of person who hates to cry in front of people.  And I convinced my parents this was the best thing for me, so now it's like I have to keep up that front.  But I think they see right through it anyway.  They can tell I am not exactly happy right now.  My mom just keeps telling me to keep my chin up.  So I am trying!  I wish I could see my parents right now.  I could use a big hug from my mom right about now.    I can't wait to go to the beach tomorrow.  I am really excited about it.  Well I guess I need to get a life, but anyway, I am just glad to get out of here for a day.

      Saw a really funny slogan today.  Have to share it with all of you.  I was behind this van today, and it was for Hammons Meat Co.  The slogan said, "You Can't Beat Our Meat" haha!!!!  I was cracking up!  That's a good one.  I am sure I won't forget that.  Good marketing!  Well I went to fill out an application at Kohls.  If I can't get a job there, I am throwing in the towel.  I am taking my toys and going home.  It is so cold here this week.  But I am still not wearing a coat, so I guess it's better than Illinois.  But anyway, I am going home to get something to eat.  Later!

      Ok everybody.  Crisis over, the comments are back.  Just in a different format.  I am kind of mad that all the comments I had from before are gone, but what can I do right?  So I am sitting in the cafe, as per usual, and I should be going home to work out, but I just don't feel like it tonight.  Guess I will just finish doing my laundry.  I hate doing laundry.  I just got a report on good ol home town, and it seems nothing has changed there.  Same old things going on that always were.  So that makes me feel better.  I at least got away from all of that.  So I decided that when I move back to Illinois it will have to be to the burbs.  I am not going back to that place.  Maybe I could move in with my brother and sister in law.  That would be fun....on second thought.  We might go to the beach Saturday.  I think it would do me some good.  Just to sit on the sand and stare at the ocean.  I need a good head clearing.  I have all these things going through my mind right now, and I just can't seem to get rid of them.  The one thought I need cleared from my head the most is John.  I can't seem to stop thinking about him, but the thoughts I have of him are from when I first met him.  I just wish I could  go back to that.  But I know the thoughts are just because I am lonely.  And I never knew I could feel so lonely in an apartment with two other people around me, but I do.  So I need to remedy that somehow.  I know I just need to find a job so I can start meeting people, but it's hard right now.  I get my hopes up and then they don't call, or I don't even get an interview.  It really starts to take it's toll on you, and I start to lose hope.  I want to take the easy way out and just go home and go back to my old job, and my old life, but I know in my heart that's not what I want.  But I am not sure that being so far from home is right for me.  I feel so disconnected from my family.    I guess I just have a way of screwing things up.  I don't even realize I am messing things up until it's too late.  Like saying something stupid, that you don't think is stupid at the time.  But later you realize that it was, and what can you do to change it?  Nothing.  All you can do is try to explain or apologize, and hope that person will forgive you.  But if they don't then you deal with it.  I am sure some of you are probably wondering where I am going with this, but the person I am speaking of knows who they are.  Well I hope they do anyway.  And I hope this person still reads this, and sees that I am sincere.    Well I am outta here, cafe is closing up.  Later!

I don't know what to do anymore.  It's like I am just hanging out in limbo trying to figure my life out.  And I may never do that.  I might not figure out what I want until I am 40 years old.  Who know's.  Oh well, I am out of here.

      First question.  What happened to my comments????  They're gone!  I hope that's a temporary thing.    So I know it's almost two weeks into January, but I have just come up with my New Year's resolution.  I have decided to work on myself.  At first I thought, why should I change anything about myself, but then I realized I am in a new place and I can be anyone I want to be.  I can change all the things I don't like about myself.  Sometimes I think being honest and saying what I think is a good thing, but then I realized that maybe being too honest can be bad too.  I guess it just depends on the situation.  But I know one thing, I am not going to apologize for who I am, I can only work on myself and try to change the things that need to be changed.  But sometimes I wish I could see myself the way other people see me.  Maybe I can come on too strong, or be too forward, or be too honest.  I guess I never saw it as a problem before, but the more I think about it, the more I think maybe I need to change it.  I think the older I get the less I know myself.  I really wonder who I am sometimes.    Ok, on to other things.  I went to Target yesterday and bought me some sleeping aids.  Saturday night I was up all night long.  I could not sleep at all.  I laid on the couch just staring at the ceiling.  Then I heard Shelly's alarm going off, so that meant it was after 5:00 a.m.  After she left for church I went into her room, and I still had some trouble falling asleep.  I set my alarm to get up for church, it went off, and I just couldn't do it.  I could not get out of bed.  I slept until noon, and I got up and I was still tired.  I really wish I could get to the bottom of this insomnia.  I have never had so much trouble sleeping in my life.  I love to sleep!  So anyway, last night I went to bed before 11:00, and I slept so good.  Thank goodness for Tylenol PM.

      Ok, so we went out last night.  Had a good time.  We went to four different bars downtown.  We were going to go to this place called Fishlips because Scott wanted to hear some live music.  Well the live music there was country.  So we passed on that place.  Everything was cool until we went to the last bar.  We had to pay $5.00 to get in, and then there was this old guy in there.  He just stood there and said, "What's up?"  Good pick up line.  So Shelly and I just kind of walked away.  Then I had to use the restroom but I could only find the guys, and there was this old guy again, who we called "Old Balls", and he pointed me to the ladies restroom.  I was like Thanks, and left.  Then Shelly and I went out and danced, and there he was again, right behind us.  When we were leaving the dance floor, he all touched Shelly and she told him what was up.    Then this girl fell flat on her face because the booth was up on this platform type thing, and you had to take a couple steps to get down.  She must have been a little drunk.  And all I saw was this chic getting up.  Shelly and Scott saw her fall.  Then Shelly re-enacted it when we got home.  That was funny!  But we had a good time.  But the buzz kill of the night was when we rolled through the Taco Bell/Pizza Hut drive thru.  I really wanted some pizza, but they stopped serving pizza at 1:00.  I was so mad.  So we had to go to Del Taco.  Not really my favorite place, but Scott likes it.    So I totally do not understand guys.  I just figured this out.  They always say that women are confusing, but I think they are just as, if not more confusing.  But that's just me.  Maybe I am just too scary or forward......yeah, maybe that's it.  But that's how I am.  I'm probably never going to change either.  So that's all I have to say about that.

      I wonder if it's possible to go crazy from lack of sleep??  I am seriously on the verge of a breakdown I think.  You could carry your groceries home in the bags under my eyes.  Last night was bad again.  I went into Shelly's room and just laid there with my eyes wide open.  So I got back up and went out to the living room, where I fell asleep on the small couch for awhile.  Then woke up and moved to the bigger couch.  Woke up when Shelly got up, and that's it.  So I probably got maybe 4 hrs of sleep!  And then I try to think of things to do during the day, and I can only go to the mall or Target so many times.  It just gets me in trouble anyway.    I put my resume on Monster for jobs in Illinois.  I figured I should keep my options open.  I mean I am not packing my things, but I would like to see what kind of opportunities I could have.  I wouldn't mind living in Chicago.  Well maybe not, I don't know.  It's a nice city.  I like it.  But I don't know that I would have the patience for the transportation.  It's crazy driving in that place.  But I guess walking is always an option.  But anyway, I did that today.    We are going out tonight.  I can't wait.  I have cabin fever.  I just want to get out and have some fun.  So hopefully we will find some cool places to go.    Speaking of cool places to go, I am off to the mall.  Victoria Secret is having a sale.  To Shelly, I do have to pay Vicki, because I don't have my own secrets.  HAHA!!  I will never forget you said that.  We need to put that one in the jar.

      I have got to stop eating sugar before I go to bed.  I had the most bizarre dreams last night.  I dreamt that I was back home, and my house was haunted.  I was begging my mom to come sleep in my room with me because I was scared.  I think I may see the hidden message in there.  Then we were all in my front yard and we were playing baseball or something, but we were picking teams, and I got mad because there were more guys on one team than the other, and it wasn't fair.  Weird.  Anyway, I ate some oatmeal chocolate chip cookies before I went to bed, I need to quit doing that.  But they were so good, fresh out the oven.  Had some for breakfast too, or lunch, whatever you call the meal you have at 2:00 in the afternoon.  I went to Kinko's today to fax my resumes, and it cost $1.00 per page.  I thought that was kind of outrageous for a local call, so I was thinking it was going to cost me $10.00, so I only faxed two of them.  That's crazy, when Shelly can fax them for free tomorrow.  But then I got to the counter and she said they don't charge for cover pages.  So it would have only cost me $5.00, but oh well.  I will just have Shelly do the rest for me tomorrow.  No big whoop!   I cried today while I was doing my hair.  Not really sure why.  It's so weird how these feelings of sadness can just creep up on you.  And after they creep up, they flood.  I am glad no one was there, I just didn't feel like talking about it.  I hate to have people see me cry.  I guess I just don't want to seem vulnerable.  Then I remembered saying goodbye to my mom when I left, and how I shouldn't have left at midnight just because John wanted to.  I mean it worked out for the best because we made good time, but I could have had more time with my parents.  I could have actually talked to my dad before I left instead of poking my head into the bedroom and saying bye.  I don't know where this is all coming from, but these are just the thoughts I had in my head today.  And I also hate the fact that I am staying with Shelly and Scott right now, sleeping on the couch.  I feel so in the way and like such an inconvience.  And I don't know why.  I guess I have always felt like that.  But the feeling is starting to overwhelm me.   I just feel like everyone else has it together except for me.  Maybe I really don't belong here.  I just wish I knew what the hell I was doing.    So last night we were watching Conan, and there was this dude on there, I can't remember his name.  But he has a book out that I have got to read.  It's called "Dude, Where's My Country".  He was talking to Conan about all the things he would like to ask George Bush.  He mentioned all these things about the Bush's and Bin Laden's being connected in some way, and all this other crap.  Like the only planes allowed to fly a couple days after September 11th were planes carrying 26 Bin Ladens back to their homes.  Now that's some interesting stuff, and I would like to read all about it.

      Today I feel like crying.  I just talked to two of my best friends, and now I am sad.  They were telling me that there is a position open in my department again, and that they are coming to get me.  Do you know how tempting it is just to call my old supervisor and tell her to hold the job because I am coming back?  I thought this was getting easier for me, but then I hear that, and it makes me just want to go home.  Now obviously I know I can't do that because I would regret it, and I would kick myself in the ass, (which by the way still hurts from working out), and because the job situation is looking up here now.  Well I think it is anyway, there are a ton more jobs available, and I am going to fax my resume in tomorrow.  But there is one that I am really excited about, so everyone cross your fingers.  It's for a Radiology Tech Aide, which is totally the field I want to get into, so hopefully they will consider me even though I have absolutely no medical experience at all.  But I figured it was worth a shot.  I won't know unless I try right?    I am so tired today, and whenever I get kind of sad, I just want to go to sleep.  I didn't get any sleep last night.  I didn't fall asleep until after 4:00 and I was up at 8:30.  Then I made some coffee and decided to start cleaning.  So after that, there was no going back to sleep.  But I could right now.    My brother called me today, and the first thing he asked me was, "You get a job yet?"  What's the deal?  Would I be talking to you right now if I had a job?  No, I would be at work.  Hello!!!  But he was just calling to see how I was doing.  I haven't actually talked to him since I left.  It's so weird how you can be so close to some of your siblings and not others.  I didn't even talk to my oldest brother before I left.  I don't even know if he really knew I was thinking about moving.  But then I talk to two of my brothers pretty often, and my sister almost every day.  I just try not to think how far away from my family I am.  And then my friends were asking me when I was coming home for a visit.  I have no idea when I will get to go home.  Hopefully before summer.  I don't know, I guess it depends on what kind of job I get.  So  anyway, I am going to go home and take a nap.

      I am a terrible, terrible daughter!!!!!  I was just IMing with my sister, and we were talking about my mom.  Apparently her stress levels are too high, and I asked my sister what was going on?  If it was just the holidays or what.  And she told me that my grandfather, who died before I was born, died on Christmas Eve.  That's why my mom doesn't like Christmas.  I totally forgot all about that, and I always give my mom a really hard time about being a scrooge and crap like that.  I feel so terrible.  She never really talked about it much which is why I didn't remember.  And now I feel like a huge jerk.  But now I am worried about my mom having high blood pressure, and high stress levels.  She isn't supposed to be stressed about anything.  Maybe it's me that is stressing her out.  I can tend to have that effect on people.  I need to call her....

      Today I am back in one of my ruts.  Maybe it's the weather or something.  It's gloomy outside today.  I think not having a routine yet is really starting to bother me.  I need to find a job, soon, and I feel like everyone thinks I am not even trying.  If my mom and dad ask me one more time I am going to flip.  I told my mom I would call her and let her know as soon as I find a job.  She has no idea what it's like, she never worked.  She stayed home and raised her kids.  My dad worked the same job for like 35 years or something, and then retired early.  They have never had to go out and find a job.  I am sending my resume to places, it's not like I am just sitting around waiting for something to come to me.    I was up this morning at 7:00, and I really should have just gotten up and showered, but instead I laid in bed and watched a movie, and fell back to sleep.  I ended up falling asleep until 2:00.  I hate sleeping that late.  Half my day is gone.  And now after I am done here, I have nothing to do.  Well except for work out.  We went and worked out last night, and I think I pulled a butt muscle.  I am way out of shape.

      Shelly and I need magnets.  We can't find any in Bakersfield.  We decided that we never really bought magnets, we just always kind of accquired them.  So now we have no idea where to get any.  Also, I wanted to make my cheesy hashbrowns, but I cannot find the hashbrowns I need anywhere.  And I thought I was out of luck when it came to tortellini, but I found out last night that I was looking in the wrong place.  So that's good, I haven't had tortellini in a long time.    We are going to start working out tonight.  I am actually excited.  I have a workout partner.  And I have gone down a size since I have been here, and I want to keep it up.  I am sure the stress will eventually go away, so I need to be working out to keep going down.    I had a weird dream last night, and I need to look it up.  I know dreaming people are dying doesn't really mean they are dying, but I hate those dreams.  They freak me out.  So I need to look that up when I get home.  Maybe I went to bed too early last night or something.  I actually went to bed at 2:00 instead of 4:00.  We went bowling last night, and I got kind of drunk at the bowling alley.  Couldn't help it, they were going down good, and I didn't eat dinner.  But I still beat Shelly and Scott.  Sorry guys, I had to brag a little.  I will drop it now.  But I need to call my mom and tell her, she would be so proud.

Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2003:  Everything happens for a reason, and people come into your life for reasons you may not know until later, but God has a plan for you, and he knows what he's doing, so have faith in him and let him guide you down the right path.  Shelly taught me to give things to God and let him do what he will with them.  You will find the answers.   And that life isn't easy all the time.  40.

      Well it's a brand new year.  Hopefully I can do something with this one.  I faxed my resume in for two jobs, and I got a call about two other jobs.  So hopefully one of those will work out.  Of course if I get a job, that means I will have to reset my sleeping schedule.  Either that or get me a night job.  I don't know what's up with me.  Last night, Scott went and got us some tacos and french fries.  Just what I needed at 2:00 in the morning.  It was good though.    New Years pretty much sucked.  Shelly highlighted my hair, and we played Scrabble.  I know, we partied like rockstars!  Can't help it.  It was a little depressing, but I just told myself it was another night.  I am just glad the holidays are over.  I just realized last night that I really miss my family.  I don't know what hit me all of a sudden, but I was laying on the couch last night, and I just started crying.  But ya know, that's because I jinxed myself on the crying thing.  I told Shelly that I realized that I haven't cried once since I broke up with John.  And then what do I do?  I cry.  Oh well.  But I called my mom on Wednesday, and I realized that I have the best mom in the world.  Thank goodness she is willing to help me or I would be screwed.  She sent me all of my credit card bills, but told me to let her know if I need help and she will put the money in my checking.  And I am going to see about getting a loan to pay them all off, so I can have just one payment.  Yeah that's a broken record.  I have done that three times already.  I have a problem.  But I think I have realized that I need to chill with the shopping.  But then I have this other problem.  I have been stressing myself out so much, and I have lost some weight, and now a lot of my clothes are just too big, but Shelly said I buy my shirts too big anyway.  So anyway, not that I am complaining, but I might have to buy a few things....  But in the words of Shelly's mom Kathy, I need to relax and enjoy my life.  I'm trying.  But I will admit, I am a worrier.   Last night I actually cooked.  It's not that I didn't think I could cook, it's just I hate cooking for just myself.  It's easier to throw in a Tombstone.  But I guess I kind of like to cook.  I just hate cleaning up afterward.    I need to make some friends here.  The three of us don't really know where to go out, or where to get good mexican food, or good breakfast.  I would like to find a nice park, where I can just go sit sometimes, if I need to relax or get out of the house, or just want to sit and read a book.  But I guess those are things I will find in time.    Oh yeah, and we went to Target the other night, and I love that place, as you all know.  But one thing that completely depressed me was all the Valentine's Day stuff in my face.  Don't get me wrong, I love hearts, and all that crap, I used to draw them all the time, but I can't take it.  I don't already know that I am all alone and that no one loves me, let's throw all this mushy crap out and remind me.  I don't mean NO ONE loves me, but you know what I mean.  I am not going to get into all that though.  I just keep thinking it's better to be alone than to be with someone who disrespects you and treats you like crap.  Alright, I am rambling on and on.  I am going to check out some jobs.

      So I am kind of excited to go home.  Something about the weekends here, I just feel lonely.  I am constantly trying to think of something to do.  So I guess I am excited to get home and hang out with my friends, and see my family.  It has only been like 4 months, but it has been a long 4 months.  I just hope I get home and really feel like I made the right decision.  Today Shelly and I went shopping and out to lunch, and I will miss that.  Going back to Streator where there is nowhere to shop and nowhere to have lunch, kind of depressing, but hopefully I won't be there long.  I am really hoping Bobbi can hook me up in Schaumburg!  That would be so sweet!  If not, I guess it's up to me to find my own opportunities outside Streator.    Last night we went out for dinner, and then I came home and wasn't feeling well.  I just sat on the bathroom floor waiting to be sick, but then all these other feelings came flooding in.  I just started crying, and I couldn't stop.  Sometimes I feel completely lost, and even though I am glad to be going home, I am wondering if I am giving up too easily.  I seriously just want to know what I am supposed to be doing.  I know, I am just beating a dead horse here.  Same old stuff everytime you come here right?  Sorry!  I am done complaining.  I am going home to have some ice cream, that will make me feel so much better!

      I have made a decision.  I feel pretty good about it too!  Shelly has been telling me that I am miserable and it's not going to go away until I make a decision.  She was right!  She's a smart girl.  But anyway, I have decided that I am going home.  I am going to call my old supervisor and see if I can get my old job back.  But I also got an e-mail from my friend Bobbi, and she told me about some openings up in our corporate office.  I had been trying to get up there for months before I came out here.  I love Schaumburg and would totally love to live up there.  But there are things I will miss about living in California.  Wearing flip flops in February, driving and seeing the mountains, palm trees, stepping on snails, (no not really), Shelly and Scott, not wearing a coat, going to church.  Things I won't miss about California:  Not working, not having my bed, stepping on snails.  I do think it will be bitter sweet for me.  In one way, I really want to go home, but in another, I am living in California.  But it all boils down to being away from my family.  Basically I don't want to be this far from them.  I miss them more than I thought I would, and I really miss my friends.  But I will totally miss Shelly, she was kind of my life coach!  Insider, Starting Over House!  UPN!  Addicted to it!  And they are in Chicago, so you get random shots of sights in the city!  Which are also bitter sweet to me because it reminds me of John and the weekend we spent there.  But I guess I gotta get over that.  He cannot give me what I want, and he does not treat me the way I deserve to be treated so I am moving on!  I will find someone who will be right for me.  I am not settling for anything less.  So that's it.  It hurts to know that I will probably never see him again after I leave here, but it's the right thing.  It's a decision that makes me feel good for once in a long time.  I just can't feel like this anymore.  It's making me sick, and Shelly even sees it, which I thought I was doing a good job at hiding it.  But I guess you can't hide that much unhappiness!  So anyway, I guess I will be changing this blog name back to Midwest Monoblogs!

      I am in a much better mood today.  Yesterday I had a total breakdown.  I took John his stuff that I had and got my stuff that he had.  And he got a puppy, and it's so cute, but anyway, I was petting it and I just started crying.  I was crying before I got there but I stopped myself before I got there.  But giving his stuff back to him just made everything so final, and I am not ready for that.  I still care about him too much, and I know I shouldn't but I can't help it.  He just started hugging me and told me he hates to see me cry.  But once it started I couldn't stop.  Once I open up those floodgates, it's all down hill from there.  So we are going to dinner tonight so we can talk.  But basically he was trying not to get attached to me because I kept saying I was leaving.  I can understand that, but he should have talked to me about it.  So anyway, that's that.  I had to vent about it.    Shelly told me today that she could hear me singing last night along with my headphones.  I was cracking up but I was kind of embarrassed too!  I didn't think I was really singing.  HAHA!  It's funny!    I have an interview on Monday, I am pretty excited about it.  It's at a radiology office, and I really hope I get it.  Because first of all, I hate not working, and second of all, I need a job.  Plain and simple!  And if I don't get it, then I guess my back up plan goes into effect!  So anyway, please be praying for me to get it.  Thanks!

      I'm sad today.  I'm not sure why.  Tomorrow is my deadline.  Shelly wants me to make a decision, and I still don't know what to do.  I am back to not sleeping, and I hate that.  Lack of sleep really makes me crazy!  I do not know what to do anymore.  I still have no job, I am not even getting calls back.  That's kind of a blow to my ego.  I mean, I am a good employee, but these people aren't even giving me a chance to prove that.  So what am I supposed to do?  I can't call them because all they put in the paper is their fax number.  I am just frustrated....I have never been in this position before, and I wonder if I will ever find something!  I guess I will just go home and have a good cry.....that will make me feel better.

      I am kind of bummed out today, but I am not really sure why.  I mean besides the same old crap going on, I feel like there is something else bothering me.  I am not sure what though.  I think the whole John thing is bothering me.  I guess I just don't understand him, or any man for that matter.  But anyway, he is just so shady, but I keep thinking there is something good in him.  When deep down I know it can't work.  But instead of just being done with him, I keep going back, and letting myself get hurt again!  When am I going to smarten up?  Probably never!    So I kind of want to go home for a week or two, but I am not sure how that will make me feel.  I am scared I will get there and just want to stay there.  So I am kind of leary about it.  I am scared I will get back here, and really hate it.  It may feel like I am starting all over again!  I don't know.  But right now I feel really lousy, and I don't know what I want.  I just keep thinking I made the wrong decision in moving out here!  That is a nagging thought!  I am just so tired of feeling like this.

      I just met a lady from Ottawa Illinois!  Small world.  She was so nice too!  I almost feel comforted after talking to her.  She was just so nice!  Anyway, she told me good luck and God bless.  So nice!  I knew there were nice people out there.  I have this icky feeling right now.  I just feel like I am not doing anything worthy right now.  And I know that a job does not define you, and all that mumbo jumbo, but I want a job where I feel like I am doing something.  Then I see all these radiology positions and I am so mad at myself for not getting into the program when I first thought I wanted to!  I mean how long am I just going to coast through my life?  You know all these people say "Oh you have plenty of time, and then other people say life is short.....so which is it??  Which philosophy should I live by?  I wish I could just call God up and say "Hey, what's next on the gameplan?"  Tell me which move to make now!  Do I stay and tough it out, or do I punk out and go home?  One day I feel lost and unsure, and the next I feel strong, and positive.    So I guess I give it more time.  My mom told me she prays for me every night to find a job, because this is where I wanted to be.  I pray for her every night too!  I worry about my mom so much!  Her blood pressure is high, and she stresses, must be where I get it.  I hate to even think about her sometimes because I miss her so much.  I miss my whole family and sometimes I think about just getting a plane ticket and going home for a week.  I mean it's not like I would have to take off work or anything.  But then I think that I would get home and want to just stay there because it's comfortable and safe.  I think it's really too soon for me to go home even for a visit.  I need to just stop because I am just going to start crying.  So anyway, I guess it's going to be one of those days!

      Forensics is an amazing science.  I could sit and watch shows about it all day long.  It's 1:13 a.m. and I am still up.  Probably because I hate going to bed and waking up to another new day.  Well that probably came out wrong.  I guess what I mean is I hate getting up knowing I have nothing to do.  I mean I get up around noon or so, eat a bowl of cereal, get online to look at jobs.  Jobs that I probably can't get, or that won't pay me enough to move.  I need to get rid of this negativity but I am not quite sure how.  King e-mailed me today and he was telling me about student loans and financial aid, and I had a glimmer of hope.  I thought, 'Yes, I will go back to school...I will get loans and just go back to school.'  But then once I got into the websites and started checking things out, that glimmer slowly faded away.  I haven't the slightest idea how to go about getting back into school.  I wish I could just move up to the burbs and get whatever jobs I need to get by.  Just until I get settled in and find something.  But I know I can't do that.  I am not sure what my deal is!  I am just at this place in my life, and I am not liking it.  And my enter button isn't working so I can't start a new paragraph!  So hey, this will just be one run on paragraph with many different topics all thrown in.  I don't know what the problem is either, I have uninstalled and reinstalled my keyboard, then it works for a little while, and then suddenly it stops!  It's making me crazy!  I think I will just go to bed before I throw it against the wall!  Good night!

      I have a million thoughts in my head right now, so bare with me.  First of all, I am starting to panic just a little bit.  I have a car payment coming up, and a couple credit card bills due, and I am just about out of money.  I am sending out resumes, but it could take a month or more to get the ball rolling, by the time you interview, and they interview other people, and they make a decision, and so on and so forth.  I am just worried.  Then I have the issue of whether or not it will pay enough for me to move up to the burbs right away.  I don't want to have to drive back and forth everyday, but I don't want a job here.  Can my life be any more screwed up right now.  I am starting to feel extrememly hopeless....it's like I just don't want to do it anymore.  I want to go lay in bed and not come out of my room.  But I know I can't do that.  I know I just need to do whatever I can to get by.  It's just sooooo frustrating.    We went out last night and every place we went just sucked so bad.  Either the place was full of people I didn't know, or people were yelling and screaming about the Illinois game, or the place was a dive.  I go out and I just wish I had stayed home.  Plus there are cops just swarming this town.  They have a task force here, and all these state police.  Apparently they are still trying to solve this murder that happened a year ago.  Why they waited a year to come back and solve it I'll never know.  Tonight we just took a ride to see what was going on and they were all over this bar in town.  They were all outside talking to people and the cars were parked all over.  It was crazy.  And taking a ride around this town and seeing what kind of place it is makes me want out so bad.    Then I get home tonight and for some reason I have John on my mind, which totally sucks.  It's a wasted emotion, because I know deep down that he was not good for me.  But I see things that make me think of him and it just hurts.  It makes me crazy to think I knew a person and related to a person for a period of time and then they totally changed.  I got this magazine in the mail with all these travel deals in it, and there was a deal for Vegas, and for L.A. and those places just make me think of him.  And now I am at the point where I feel like I can't and don't want to trust another guy.  Between my past experiences with guys and hearing about all these men cheating on their girlfriends and wives, I feel like I don't ever want to get hurt again, so therefore I will just cease putting myself out there.  I guess I just want to protect myself, and maybe I trusted too easily.  I don't want to go through life with that kind of attitude, but I don't know how else to feel.  I feel like I open myself up to people and they take advantage of me.    Well I guess I have rambled on enough.  And if you made it this far, thanks for reading.  Sorry if I brought you down!

      Well I got the call today, and the lady told me she really wanted me for this position, but needed to find out if I was bilingual.  She said, "Please tell me you are."  At that point I knew I didn't have the job.  I said "No, I'm not, I just know bits and pieces, but I can't carry a conversation in Spanish."  She says, "Yeah me too."  Then she tells me that the day she interviewed me she sent a proposal to hire me, but they said unless I was bilingual she couldn't hire me.  I am so pissed off right now, I can't even see straight.  She wants me for the job, thinks I would be great for the job, but can't hire me.  She told me she wants to call me if something else comes up, that she is going to keep my resume on her desk.  Ok great, but when will something else come up?  She also said she will forward my resume on to some other departments that are hiring, but they are not as high level as the position I was up for.  I just feel like crying!  What am I supposed to do?  Where the hell am I supposed to be?  I thought for sure I would get this job.  I mean I really felt good about it, but of course, as soon as I get my hopes up about anything, they get stomped all over!  UGH!!!!    Tonight I am supposed to go to dinner with some friends, and now I just don't feel like it!  I don't feel like talking to anyone, I don't feel like being around anyone, and I don't feel like eating.    Well I am starting all over now.  Gotta get the resume and cover letter up to date again, and send it out!  I am really hating life right now.  Did I totally screw everything up or what?

      I know my Dad means well, but he's going to kill my fish!  I am feeling very down today....I'm not really sure what to do with it actually.  I just don't want to get out of bed, knowing I have absolutely nothing to do.  I wish they would call me about this job already!  Geez, I can't take it anymore.  And right now I just feel like crying.....but I honestly think it's just PMS.  Seriously!    I went to lunch with my mom, sister, and niece today.  My niece cracks me up.  She is 4 years old and acts like she's an adult.  She came in my room this morning and woke me.  She turns on the light and says. "It's morning."  She kept asking me if I was going to get up.  It was 10:45, I don't get up that early!  I didn't go to bed until after 3:00.  Then she stayed with me while I got ready and my mom and sister were running errands.  She was yelling at me that we were going to be late for lunch!  She's a character!  Love her!  I don't know why I even bother blogging anymore.....I don't think anyone even reads these.  I should just go back to my trusty old journal.

        "Regrets are a waste of time.  They are the past crippling your future."    I am watching Fear Factor, and it is so nasty!!  When does the need for money or 15 minutes of fame become so desperate that people would put this stuff in their mouths?  I don't care how nice $50,000 would be, I could not do it.  I am sitting here gagging just watching them.  I guess it could be a mind over matter deal, but there is no way.  I cleaned my fish tank the other day and I almost puked because the water smelled so bad.  I saw that quote on someone else's blog, and it couldn't have come at a better time.  That was just what I needed to hear.  It's from Under the Tuscan Sun, which is a movie I have been wanting to see.  I may need to get out and rent it.    I didn't get out of bed until 1:00 today.  And then I didn't get dressed until almost 5:00.  I think there is a certain level of depression there.  Which I really shouldn't be.  I guess I am just worried I won't get this job.  But I shouldn't worry yet.  But I just sit here and think about the interview, and you know afterward you always think of better answers than the ones you gave.  I just wish I would have been more prepared for it.  Oh well.  I sent her the Thank You and if I don't hear by Wednesday I will send a little follow up.  Can't hurt right?    Oh great, I just saw a preview for the news, and one of the headlines is about medications that could be deadly.  A medication I am taking!  Alright, well if I suddenly drop dead, you all know why!  Sue the pharmaceutical (sp?) companies, and I can take care of all of you.

      I had kind of an epiphany today.....I have been really up and down about this John deal.  First I thought that maybe it was a mistake not to call him before I left, but of course Shell made me feel better about that.  She told me I did everything right.  And I was sitting in my room today and I was putting on my makeup and I realized.....HELLO!  I have been hurt before by a guy and I got over it, and I will probably be hurt again.  This is not the end of the world.  I have plenty of other things going on in my life, or I mean hopefully I will have other things going on, and I can't sit around and dwell over something that probably wouldn't have worked even if I had stayed in California.  So that's my thoughts on that.

      Well I wanted to stay home last night and I did.  Usually when I say I am going to stay home I end up going out anyway.  But I went and rented two movies.  Lost in Translation and My Boss's Daughter...BUT, I didn't get to watch them last night because I couldn't get my DVD player hooked up.  My brother got a new one, so he gave me his old one.  So anyway, I couldn't get the stupid thing hooked up.  So that's what I am doing today!  So I will let you all know how they were.  I have been wanting to see Lost in Translation forever.  Movie reviews later!

       Analyze your life in terms of it's environment.  Are the things around you helping you toward success-or are they holding you back? -W. Clement Stone   I think I am going to start doing the quote thing again.  I liked it!    I just want to make it through this weekend so I can hear about this job.  I know I should probably be sending my resume to other places too, just in case, but I haven't.  I don't know if it's because I am confident that I have this job, or if it's because I am being lazy.  I just really want this job, but I guess I need to prepare myself for the possibility that I may not get it.  But I am praying that I get it.  God knows that I don't belong here, and I think he will put me where I belong.  I just hope it's in Schaumburg.  Ok, enought about that.  Top Model is on right now, so I am totally going to stay here and watch it.  They are recapping all the episodes up until this encore show.  Shelly and I were addicted to this show.  We never missed it.  And I haven't seen it in two weeks.  So I'm here.  Reality TV is great.....I don't care what anyone says!

      I seriously think I am in a major funk right now.  I know things will get better, but I hate feeling this way.  I told my mom yesterday that I had to go get my meds, and she told me that I need to learn to control myself.  I can't control my emotions!  I wish I could, but I can't.  I have tried a million times.  I told her I just start thinking about things, and I start crying.  SO she proceeds to tell me that my life is just mixed up right now, and things will start to fall into place eventually.  I know she's right, but I want things to start to fall into place now!  And I am trying to just get John out of my head, and it's really hard.  But I am sure that will come with time.  But I hate when you see things or hear things that remind you so much of someone.  That makes it rough!  Went out last night.  It kinda sucked, but I had the most fun when I got to Cheapseats.  Jennifer and Kathy were there, and Lorie and Leesa left.  Of course Jenny chumped me, as per usual.  Tuesday night she told me to meet them and 10 minutes after I got there she left.  And she leaves for the most stupid reasons.  I really don't feel like we can be friends like we used to be.  We just have different interests.  I am interested in finding my career and a nice guy and settling down and having a family.  She is interested in being able to whatever she wants with whoever she wants.  That's all I am going to say about that.    I decided to stay home this weekend.  I really don't get anything out of going out.  I see the same people I used to see.  So I am just going to get some movies and stay home all by myself!  And I will be fine with that!

      I really hope I get this job I interviewed for yesterday because if I don't I have to start all over again.  But it's so funny how things work out.  I had called my old supervisor to see if I could get a job back in Ottawa, well she told me there wasn't anything right now.  So I followed up on the Schaumburg deal.  Well yesterday I get up there and Bobbi comes down to see me.  She told me that all the Boise people that worked in Ottawa lost their jobs yesterday.  I was shocked.  And I think it's crap.  I feel terrible for all those people, and a lot of those people are my friends!  So anyway, I guess that whole "hiring freeze" they were on was a blessing in disguise.  Hind sight is 20/20.  I hope I feel the same way about John soon.  Ever since the call I got Sunday night I can't stop thinking about him, and it's killing me inside.  Once I really think about it I guess I would be hurt too.  But I was trying to protect myself.  That's what you are supposed to do right.  But now I feel like I need closure all over again.  Everyone is saying he is just trying to make me feel bad, but he really sounded hurt on the phone.  I don't know what to do.  I want to call him but I know it will just make things hard.  I really cared about him, and I thought he cared about me too until I got to California, and then he just disappeared.  But then would show up whenever he wanted.  And when I left I hadn't heard from him in like 3 weeks.  Did I do the right thing?  I don't know now.  AAAAHHHHH!!!!

      Ok, so all weekend I was all pumped about my interview today, which I still am, but last night something happened and now I can't get it out of my head.  I was sitting around watching T.V. and my cell phone rang.  It was John.  I was kind of shocked for a minute, he usually just sends a text message.  I answer and he starts asking me what I'm doing, and if I got his message.  He did send me a text message, but we are too far away from each other for me to get it.  Anyway, he just asked what I was doing.  Then he says, "You in Illinois?"  Something he always jokes about.  Well this time I said "Yes" and he couldn't believe it.  Then he asks me why I didn't call him before I left.  I told him he didn't deserve a call before I left.  I was there for 4+ months....how many times did he call me.  He got all upset and said he had to go and hung up on me.  I just started crying.  I was doing fine with the whole situation, not talking to him, not seeing him.  I thought that's what he wanted.  So I sat here a few minutes, and then I called him back.  I told him he needed to talk to me and tell me what he was thinking.  He told me he was really sad and realizing how much he cared about me.  ANd that he would have liked to see me before I left.  I told him how hard it was for me not to call him before I left but it would have made it so much harder.  So now I don't know if he was being sincere, or just trying to make me feel bad.  But I try to put myself in his situation.  How would I feel.  I guess I would be hurt if someone left and didn't tell me.  But it's his fault too and he knows that.  He was the one going two weeks without calling.   Then he says "I'm moving to L.A. in a month and I didn't know how to tell you that"  but last time it was "You kept talking about going back to Illinois, I didn't want to get too close to you."  So now I am realizing they are all just excuses.  I know I made the right decision.  I am near my family and friends again, and I have a great opportunity in front of me, so I am going to concentrate on myself.

      I have an interview tomorrow at 2:00.  I am so excited.  Usually I am nervous and don't want to go, but this is different.  I am excited to go up there and see the new building and talk to the supervisor!  I just really hope it all goes well and I get this job.  My brother brought me all sorts of apartment books yesterday, so I am going to look through those.  Hopefully I can find something I can afford.  But I guess I could always get a second job if I needed.    I almost have all my stuff put away.  Last night I could see my floor again, but I couldn't find my bed.  So when I got home at 2:00 a.m. I had to get all that stuff off my bed.  So now it's a mess again.  I hate putting all this stuff away, and if I get this job, I am going to have to do it all over again!  Oh well!  That's life.

      I'm home!!!  YAY!!  Shelly and I made excellent time.  We both wanted to get home so we just drove and drove and drove!  Made it home in two days!  My parents couldn't believe it!  I was kind of bummed because I called home when we were in Iowa and my mom wasn't home.  I didn't know if she was going to be home tonight because she went up to visit her sister and get a new car.  My mom is a haggler so I figured that would take hours.  But she was home when I came home.  It was good to be home.  It IS good to be home. I actually can't wait to climb into my bed!  But I thought I would throw out a blog first.  The trip went very smoothly.  We didn't hit any traffic and we cruised at 85 or above the whole way home.  Well until we hit Iowa where the speed limit went back down to 65.  Then it felt like we were crawling.  Shelly and I had a little story made up in case we got pulled over.  I thought I was going to in Nebraska.  Right when we crossed the state line I see a cop sitting there.  I just tapped my brake hoping to get slowed down enough not to get a ticket.  Shelly said he looked over at us, but she thought maybe just to see if we were wearing our seatbelts.  So then I kept checking my mirror.  I thought for sure I would see him coming after me.  But he didn't!   So all in all the trip was good.  I found my honeymoon spot.  I don't want to go to your typical tropical resort.  Shelly and I were discussing it, and I swear we were sharing a brain on this trip, and I would love to go to Vail or someplace like that for my honeymoon.  That is if I can find someone who will put up with me enough to want to marry me.  Hehe!  But anyway, I gotta get to bed.  I am tired!

      Ok, I am getting annoyed.  I came to the cafe, and Philip the owner put the computers up on the counter.  So now I have to stand to do all this stuff.  I can't post on my other site, and I can't read anyone's comments.  I am kind of peeved about all of this.  Plus I still feel so sick!  I thought rest and sleep were supposed to help you get better.  Everyday I just feel worse.  My chest is all congested, and my head feels all weird.  I don't like it!  But Shelly, being all mom like, has been taking care of me!  Thanks Shell!  But I slept a lot last night and I still feel like I could go home and go back to sleep!    I got another e-mail from Bobbi, and her supervisor wants to know when I can come in for an interview.  She wants to get me in ASAP!!  I am so excited.  I really hope this all works out!  I need to call my mom and tell her all about it!  I am always afraid I will jinx it though!  But I have been praying to God that this will always work out for me.  I told him that I know he will put me where he wants me to be.  So I am giving it all to him!  I have a good feeling though!  Pray for me guys!  I need all the help I can get!  So only 4 more days before we leave!  I am so pumped to go.  Especially since I might have an opportunity waiting for me at home!  I am just giddy!!

      I started packing up some stuff today!  I am ready to go!  I just want to get home.  I sent my resume to my friend Bobbi and she forwarded it on to her supervisor.  I am so pumped about it.  I really hope this works out for me!  That would be so great!  So I guess I will just see what happens.    It is so nice today.  I am loving the weather here.  I will definitely miss that!    I am tired, I think I will go home and take a little nap!

      Ok, so I am leaving one week from tomorrow.  I have a lot to do.  I really don't want to pack all that stuff up again, but I am ready to get home.  I didn't even want to get out of bed today.  Kim, my old supervisor, called me back today.  Boise is on a hiring freeze right now but she told me she would keep me informed.  So I just layed in bed staring at the ceiling just thinking I have totally screwed up everything.  I quit my job and moved out here, pretty much without a plan.  Now I am feeling the brunt of it.  I am not sure if I will be able to get a job back home or not.  Jenny just told me about Joe's needing a bartender on Wednesday nights.  Yeah!  I am not sure I could put up with the drunk people in there.  I would probably be an annoyed, rude bartender.  So that means no tips!  But I guess I will just see what happens.  Hopefully everything works out for me ok.  I am praying it does.

      I have a really bad headache today.  I don't know if it's because it's raining or what, but my head hurts!    Shelly and I went for a walk this morning.  Felt good to get up and do something.  I also talked to my old supervisor today.  We talked about me coming back, and she told me she would see what she could do for me.  That made me feel a lot better.  I mean I don't want to go back there and fall back into the same old rut I was in, but I want to know that ithere's a job for me.  At least I can be making money while I search for something else.  But I was starting to get a complex out here.  No one even wanted to interview me!  I learned that a career is important to me, and I have a ton of opportunity with Boise.  I should not have left.  Now I might have to fight to get back in there, but if that's what I have to do, then that's what I'll do.    Kathy, you got a blog!  That's awesome!  I will have to link you up!

      So I just watched Friends, and it totally made me cry.  Kind of made me think of me leaving and not saying goodbye to John.  But whatever, that is over.    I don't know why I am so emotional today.  I was at work late tonight, getting a little frazzled, but that's how I work best sometimes.  I am really liking my job though!  So I guess I can't really complain.    I really wish the weather would get nice.  It was kind of nice yesterday, but a little windy!  Oh well, better than cold right?  The neighbors downstairs from me have a kid, or maybe two, I don't really know.  But all I ever hear is the guy totally yelling at his son.  His name is Kyle.  I feel kind of bad for the poor kid.    I am getting settled into my apartment.  Still need a few things, but I get paid tomorrow.  My first paycheck!  YAY!  I don't know where I am going to cash it.  I put in for direct deposit, but I don't know how long that takes to go into effect.  I guess if I absolutely have to I can go home this weekend and cash it.  Or maybe wire it to them or something.  Who knows.  I have to figure out the banking situation.    But all in all, things are good!  I am liking the job, the apartment, the mall!  Yep!  I am right by Woodfield Mall!  Sah-weet!!

      So last night I went out with Bobbi and Nick, her boyfriend.  I had a good time.  We went to see an 80's cover band!  I love hearing all the old 80's tunes.  The lead singer was foreign but I am not sure where he was from, but he sounded just like every singer he covered.  It was pretty cool!  But while we were waiting for this band to start I got a call on my cell phone.  The call came up blocked and I had no idea who was calling me and I talked to this person for a couple minutes thinking it was someone else.  Then once I got into the bathroom I realized who I was talking to.  It was John.  My heart stopped for a minute I think.  I couldn't believe he called me.  So we were talking and he was asking where I was living and what I was doing.  I told him I was really happy here.  And then he proceeded to give me a hard time about leaving and not telling him.  He said that if I had called him he wouldn't have let me leave.  Uh, yeah whatever!  I hate the feeling I am having right now.  I know that he was and is so bad for me.  But he talked about coming to visit me and I was like Yeah come and see me.  But I don't know why we would need to see each other.  I asked him why he wanted to come see me and he told me he missed me!  Well hello, I was there for 5 months, he could have seen me as much as he wanted.    What is wrong with me?  Do I not know any better?  Do I not see how badly he treated me?  Do I think I am worth so little that I can allow someone to treat me that way?  I don't know what my problem is?

      So I am moved into my new apartment, and I really like it!  I still have a lot to put away, but it's getting there.  Bobbi gave me an awesome idea, my shower curtain has red, yellow, blue, and green polka dots all over it, and she told me I should find an old Twister spinner to put on my wall.  That would be so cute I think.  So I need to look around and see what I can find!    I haven't really felt too lonely yet, but I start to worry a little bit about the bills coming in.  But I will manage just fine I think.  I hope so anyway.    I really like my job so far.  Today these girls told me I was doing well, and picking up everything really quickly...but I don't feel like I am.  I want to know everything there is to know right now.  But it will all come with time I know.    I talked to my friend Nikki the other day and she said I sounded so happy!  I was glad to hear that.  I really am happy now!  I never thought it would happen for me, and I thought it was just too good to be true.  But I think about it, and realize maybe this is what God wanted for me!  So I am just thanking him and enjoying it!

      So I am moved into my new apartment....well sort of.  All my stuff is in here.  I don't have much put away.  But I am doing much better today.  I got to go to Target.  I don't know what it is, but shopping can make anything feel better!  If they ever told me I was terminally ill, I think I would just shop everday for the rest of the time I had left.  Pray and shop!  That's all I would do!  And then I would be buried with all my favorite new things.  Where am I going with this?  I'm nuts, I don't know.    So anyway, I went to Target today and got me a new shower curtain.  I had to take a bath this morning.  It's weird, I just read Jen's blog and she was talking about taking baths, and then I had to take one.  Ugh!  I haven't taken a bath in I don't know how long.  But I got a cute new shower curtain, and bathmat, and my bathroom is going to be cute.    Yesterday my parents and brothers helped me move, but as soon as they got everything in here they took off.  My mom was going to stay with me but decided not to.  I was almost in tears when they were leaving.  I don't know why.  I guess I didn't expect them to take off so soon.   But today I am better, I was just exhausted last night.  But like I said, I went to Target.  It made everything better!  At first I thought maybe I was going to hate living alone, but I think I might like it!  I can do whatever I want to this place, and if there is a mess, I know I made it.  If something is broken, I know I broke it.  So on and so forth!  So anyway, gotta go finish up some things!

      Tomorrow I am moving to Schaumburg.  I should really be packing right now, but I am procrastinating.  I am notorious for that.  But anyway, I am excited and nervous both.  But no more getting up at 4:30 to drive 90 miles to work.  Sitting in traffic.  All done with that!  I will probably be getting a ticket in the mail soon though, for going through the I-Pass lanes.  I had no change the other day.  I had no choice.  So I think they got my picture, I should have smiled.  So anyway, I just hope I don't get more than one.  Because I did it a few times.   But anyway, moving tomorrow.  Got the U-Haul.  Got the money!  Got the groceries.  I have been up for about 20 hours now.  I really want to go to bed right now, but I still have to pack.  But of course I am sitting here blogging.  So I guess I should go!

      Yes people!  I finally got a job....and boy does it feel good.  Initially I didn't get the job I wanted because I am not bi-lingual.  Well then I got a call on Monday asking me if I was still interested in the position.  I believe they decided to hire another person because they are extremely busy.  And this time when they said "I'll keep your resume on file" they meant it.  So today I accepted their offer, and I am so happy.  And I am actually getting a little more money than I had anticipated, which really makes me happy.  Now I can finally move up there, get my own place, and be right where I have been wanting to be.    I am nervous and excited.  They want me to start on Monday, which is cool, but now I have to commute the hour and a half for a couple weeks.  But I guess that's better than not having a job.  So I am not complaining.  After I got done calling everyone, I just sat on my bed and thought for a minute.  And then I just said "Thank you God"  I have been praying and praying over this.  And I think the first time they called me was my little test to see if I really wanted it.  I was so upset that I didn't get it.  So now I know that I really want it.  And I got it!  All is good right now.

      Everytime I eat anything now I think of Shelly and her telling me how many carbs are probably in it.  Today I got up and made myself a sausage and cheese omelet, but I can't have an omelet without toast.  So I started out the day with carbs.  But then Kelli and I went for a walk, so I felt better about the carbs.   But then I was hungry again in the afternoon and I had these awesome chicken strips.  They were Hooters chicken strips with the wing sauce.  I got them at the grocery store.  They were a lot better than I thought they were going to be.  So those were good, and then later I needed something sweet, so I ate some cookies.  And then even later, I wanted some Cheetos.  So basically I ate way too much today, and way too many carbs I'm sure.  Probably more than some people eat in a week or two.  Oh well!  I will walk 4 miles tomorrow.  So I got some news on a job today, but I can't really say anything yet, plus I don't want to jinx it.  But keep your fingers crossed, pray, and all that stuff.  I just really want a job and to get out of here.  Streator is not good for me.  Living with my parents is not good for me!  I love them to death, but I need out.    So anyway, nothing too important.  Just rambling on as usual.  I can't wait until I can come on here and vent about work.

      I spent all day Thursday and Friday watching Court TV.  It was the trial for the Texas mother who killed two of her children and injured the third one so badly that he is legally blind, and won't be able to walk without a walker.  He was only 14 months old.  So anyway, this woman plead not guilty by reason of insanity.  She said that God told her to kill her children so they could be in Heaven with him.  Now I am all about signs from God, but if I thought he was telling me to kill someone, I might think about that one twice.  So anyway, she murdered her own children and four psychiatrists testified that she was clearly insane.  She was acquitted.  Now I believe that she must be insane, but I think she should still be locked up.  They are obviously going to send her to a facility, but part of me thinks that she should go to prison and they should make no attempts to rehabilitate her.  I mean she beat her kids with a 10 lb rock.  That's brutal, and then she called 911.  They have her on anti-psychotic drugs, but what if she stops taking them?  I just think she should be locked up, or they could beat her with a 10 lb rock.  That seems fair.  Eye for an eye.  I know, that's not very Christian of me, but it upsets me.    Anyway, moving on.  The bid for the job I sent my resume in for goes down Tuesday.  So I really hope they call me for an interview Wednesday.  Then they say, "You got the job" on Thursday, "can you start Monday."  That's what I hope!  I got an invitation to a friends wedding yesterday.  I like going to weddings, but I hate not having a date.  That sucks!  So you either gotta go alone, find some guy that you are friends with to go, or just skip it all together.  So I don't know, maybe I will find some random guy to take as my date.  Maybe I will see a cute guy walking down the street....haha!    Amy, this one is for you.  I dreamt the other night that I was being chased by a giant ant....and some guy killed it by chopping his head off....there were some other weird details, but I can't remember them now.  But it was a strange dream.  I mean this ant was huge!

      Ok, I have a new opportunity in the works.  Julie e-mailed me a posting from Boise/Ottawa.  It reports to my old supervisor, so I sent my resume.  Hopefully it will all work out and I can get back in there.  I need something for now while I figure out what the hell I am doing with my life.  It pays a little bit more than what I was making before so that's a plus.    My ENTER key works again!  You don't know how happy that makes me!  It's the little things!  Of course I had to set up a whole new profile for myself, but at least the thing works now!    Went walking today with Kelli.  So that made me feel a little better.  I just want to start working again.....really soon!  So I am praying that this job at Boise works out for me.  Then I can look into going back to school.    Well I don't really have anything else to report.  My life isn't too interesting right now.

      This weekend was pretty uneventful!  I went home Friday night, went out to the softball games.  It was freezing.  Saturday I started to feel a cold coming on.  So I pretty much drugged myself up with cold medicine!  I hate being sick!  Hung out at my parents house, got lots of sleep.  I really didn't do anything that is worth blogging about.  So I will get to my point.  I am sad.  I don't know why.  I guess I am just still adjusting to the new place and new job and all that.  But when I go home for the weekend, I hate coming back here.  Now I have plenty of things to do, like laundry and what not, but then I go and read people's blogs...(i.e. Shelly and Scott's) and I get sad and wish I were back in California.  It's amazing how you put the feelings of unhappiness you felt in the back of your head, or just forget them completely!  And WHY?  Why when you are in one place, you want to be in another, and when you get to that place, you want to be somewhere different?    Is it just a viscious cycle?  Constantly?  I have been told I am too analytical, so maybe I am just thinking too much!  I guess I have to MAKE a life up here, it's not just going to come to me!    So I am going to the doctor next week about this stupid kidney stone.  I still have it.  It's been three weeks!  AND, I got my bill from the Emergency Room....it is over $3000.00.....can you believe that?  I almost fell over!  I mean I know my insurance should cover most of it, but geez.  That is a lot of money.  Good thing it didn't happen before I had insurance.  There is no way!  I am paying them all that money to tell me something I knew already.  They were just verifying!  Oh, and they wrote me a prescription for vicodin, and gave me a pee strainer!  Totally worth $3000.00.  Ugh!    Oh I know the links up there look kinda dumb, but that's the only place I could get them to show up!  Someone let me know if you can get them to go anywhere else!!

      I am sure you are all just dying to know what is going on with my kidney stone.  Well here ya go.  Thought I had passed it because I went a few days with no pain.  But then Saturday night at 2a.m. the pain came back.  So I took a vicodin and slept until noon the next day!  That was great.  The pain on the other hand, was not so great.  So I guess that answers my question on whether I passed it or not.      The kidney doctor I was talking to last week asked Leesa about me again today, so she called me.  He told me that since I haven't passed it, that he would like to do an x-ray and see where it is.  I am quite interested in knowing myself.  So I am going to try to figure out a time I can make it home.  I will probably pass it by then.  You know what's funny?  Even though I was in tons of pain, I still thanked God, because this happened after I had my insurance back.  If this had happened before then, I would not have gone to the emergency room, that's for sure.   I talked to Shelly tonight, and I totally miss hanging out with her and Scott.  I miss California.  I am definitely going out to visit this fall or something.  She was telling me all about the new grill they got, and the chairs out on the patio.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have stayed there, but then I think of the times I wasn't happy, and I would probably be there thinking that right now.  I am just a little lonely, that's all!  Things will fall into place soon, I can feel it!

      Why can't I find the new templates everyone is sporting now?  I am in need of a little face lift on this page.  Oh well.  So a little update on the kidney stone.  It was in fact a kidney stone....but as of the last two days I have not had any pain.  So I am guessing I passed it.  I never saw anything, but it was only 4mm so I guess I could have missed it.  SO that's that.  It has been storming like crazy up here.  I like it though, storms relax me for some reason.    Well the job is still going well.  But I sit near this woman, who is a supervisor, and she is really starting to annoy me.  She yells over the cubicle walls to people.  Instead of picking up the phone, or actually getting up to walk over she just yells.  First of all that is inconsiderate of the people around her, i.e. ME, and it's also just pure laziness.  And also, she does not wash her hands after she uses the restroom.  Now that is just gross.  And she also does this stupid giggle after everything she says.  I don't know if that's a nervous habit or what, but its annoying also!    Ok, well I am done ranting, I am going to bed!

      Wow, now I see what everyone was talking about with the new Blogger design and what not.  Very cool!  I guess it's been awhile since I have blogged here!  I apologize to my fans, er I mean readers!    So I have been in pain since Sunday....first thought pulled back muscle, then kidney stone, then gall bladder, now kidney infection.  I guess the only way to really know is to get my butt to a doctor.  It just sucks because I don't have a doctor up here, but I did get a phone number for one.    Do you notice that no matter where you work or what you do, there is always a woman who assumes the role of "work mom".  You know, the one you go to with mom type issues.  I went to this woman and asked her for a referral to a doctor.  Then later today she came over and told me if I needed anything to call her, she said she was worried about me.  I thought that was very nice.  She barely knows me and she is willing to help me out like that.   So I guess tomorrow I will actually call a doctor and figure out what's wrong with me. I figure as long as the pain is bearable then I don't need to go to the doctor.  I am so stubborn when it comes to that.    The job is going very well.  I am finally starting to get things!  It's all starting to click for me!  And I have a little crush on the guy that sits next to me.  He is sooooo nice!  I don't think there is a nicer guy than him out there!  But of course I don't really know him that well!  But he's a cutie!  So anyway....I am going to bed.  I am exhausted as per usual!  And that is another symptom of a kidney infection!  But enough with the self diagnosis, I will let you know the real diagnosis when I find out!  It's probably something silly anyway!

      Ok, so today I was talking to my supervisor about Cali, she used to live there, and had a posting printed out.  She wants to go back.  We were talking and she told me how she came from a small town too, and when she got out there she got a roommate she didn't know.  She said she had never seen cocaine before that.  And then I said, oh well my roommate is a good church going girl.  Then she asked me if I go to church and I said no.  I told her I grew up in church, and I went to church in California, and that I missed it.    She started to tell me about this church she goes to.  And she also told me she just got baptised last weekend.  And she invited me to go, told me if I ever wanted to go on a Saturday night, to let her know.  I was so excited about it.  So then I went on their website.  I know I have heard of this church before.  It's called Willow.  So I really think I am going to check it out!  I need to be going to church so bad.  I need God in my life.  Not that he is not in my life, but I need him back in the forefront of things!  I need him to be a priority!  When I was in California, I had Shelly, she was such a good influence on me.  We talked about God probably every day!  Now I don't have that!  I need that!  I was so much happier when I was going to church out there!    I am going to prioritize and get what's important in my life at the top of the list!  Everyone say a prayer for me!

      Ok, it's a nice night, so I have all my windows open!  There is apparently some sort of skunk problem around here, because that's all I can smell right now.  I smelled it the other night too!  It's horrible!  But I can't shut my windows because it will get hot in here.  And I am way too cheap to turn on my air, unless I absolutely have to!  I wonder if I light a bunch of candles if that will help?  Probably not huh?  OH well, I guess I will have to deal with it!  But dude, it's nasty!  I know my face is all scrunched up right now as I type!  I gotta go get the air freshener and lighters!    Plus I am supposed to be doing work right now.  Gotta go!

      Kathy said my blogs are too depressing.  So I have to liven it up here.    I just got done doing my Slim in 6.  I fell prey to the 3 a.m. infomercials again.  But this really looked like a legit deal.  So I ordered.  And I got it a couple weeks ago, but tonight I finally opened it.    After being home and eating a ton this past weekend, I felt I needed to get it out and start it!  They do a lot of lunges, I think my legs will hurt tomorrow.    I have got to start eating better!  Today I ate way too much junk, not enough veggies and fruits, as my mom would say.  She is always on me about eating better!  I know I should, my stomach would thank me!    Work is going ok.  I still dislike my manager a ton!  I just have no respect for him.  I think he is very unprofessional.  But I liked him on Monday when he told us we get to leave early on Friday!  I am so excited about that.  That's pretty pathetic when that is the highlight of your week.  But oh well.  I get to see the twins this weekend, I am happy about that.  Haven't seen them in a couple months!  They are just so darn cute!  I miss them a ton!      That's my blog, hope it's not too sad.  I don't think it was!

      I am sad today!  I think I will go cry myself to sleep!  How do you get someone out of your system?  Therapy?  Hypnotism?  Lobotomy?  What?  How?  Can anyone tell me?

      I can never think of a catchy title!  I am so uncreative!  Anyway, I am not really sure what I want to write here today. I am tired of going on and on about how I am feeling.  I am not really sure anymore.  Maybe I am bipolar or something.  One minute I feel great, I am happy and excited about life, and my job and my apartment, and the next I am sad, and homesick, and lonely.    I was at home Monday night through Wednesday night, and I did not want to come back here.  And I did not want to go to work this morning.  And there is nothing so terrible about my job that I shouldn't want to go.  I don't know what my deal is.  Sometimes I really think I need therapy!  But this weekend, I am going to actually get out and do something.  And I am not going home.  Bobbi and her boyfriend and some of his friends are going to Blues Fest in Chicago, so I am going too!  Well as far as I know, as long as it doesn't rain.    Well I am hungry, going to make something for dinner!

      Amy and I were talking today about how no one blogs anymore.&nbsp; It's kind of disappointing, but I guess people have lives and stuff.&nbsp; It's just I like to know what's going on in my friend's lives.&nbsp; Obviously I can't talk to everyone every day, so this is the next best thing.&nbsp; I am guilty of not keeping up on this one, but I am not really sure who reads it anymore, since I have a different one.&nbsp; My other blog is sort of unrated.&nbsp; There are days when I am just ticked off and I cuss up a storm on it, or I complain about people I work with, or complain about certain friends.&nbsp; None of the friends who read it obviously.&nbsp;   Had to go back to the doctor this week.&nbsp; I was having more pain in my back, thought maybe I had a kidney infection.&nbsp; Turned out to be a UTI, but the doc said it could possibly be another kidney stone!&nbsp; Grrreeat!&nbsp; But I am feeling better now.&nbsp; On all sorts of antibiotics.&nbsp; I had no idea antibiotics could mess with you so much!&nbsp; I have felt sick all day.&nbsp; Weird!&nbsp; Oh well, as long as they do what they are supposed to!&nbsp; But the side affects are crazy!&nbsp; Let me give you an example...crazy!     Less common or rare side effects may include: Abdominal pain, allergic reactions, anemia, chills, convulsions, depression, diarrhea, eye irritation, fatigue, fever, hallucinations, headache, hepatitis, inability to fall or stay asleep, inability to urinate, increased urination, inflammation of heart muscle, inflammation of the mouth and/or tongue, itching, joint pain, kidney failure, lack of feeling or concern, lack of muscle coordination, loss of appetite, low blood sugar, meningitis (inflammation of the brain or spinal cord), muscle pain, nausea, nervousness, red, raised rash, redness and swelling of the tongue, ringing in the ears, scaling of dead skin due to inflammation, sensitivity to light, severe skin welts or swelling, skin eruptions, skin peeling, vertigo, weakness, yellowing of eyes and skin.     Um yeah!&nbsp; Everything except death....oh wait, that's in the next paragraph. Kind of makes me want to just keep the urinary tract infection!&nbsp; Geez!&nbsp;

      Ok, so I woke up this morning with the worst back pain.&nbsp; It started right in the middle of my lower back.&nbsp; Just thought maybe I slept weird.&nbsp; But once I got to work it developed into a whole different pain.&nbsp; Yes, the kidney problems are back.&nbsp; All day long, my left lower back was just killing me!&nbsp; Took a handful of Ibuprofen, and tried to fight through it.&nbsp; Tried to be a champ, and not only was I a champ, but I was a champ an hour and fifteen minutes longer than I was supposed to be.&nbsp; Of course the one day I really want to go home on time, I can't!&nbsp; You might know it!&nbsp; So anyway, I am feeling better right now because I have the vicodin still!&nbsp; So I am about ready to go to bed.&nbsp; Because I am sure I will wake up in pain again tomorrow!&nbsp; But we'll see!&nbsp; I don't wanna go to the doctor!&nbsp; I just don't!

      I was just clicking on people's links to blogs, and it's doing this weird thing where it takes you to some search results....I don't know, whatever!  So I want to go to sleep but I can't stop thinking.  My mom and I had some stupid fight, and my sister-in-law was involved and now I feel absolutely horrible!  I feel now like maybe she felt ganged up on, and I do not want her feeling like that.  My mom is awesome and has done sooo sooo much for me!  So now I feel like a huge pile of crap for treating her badly!  I am the worst daughter in the world right now, and I will go get her a card tomorrow.  I left today without even saying goodbye to her.  What a crappy thing to do!  I left her a note, apologizing, but is that as good as standing face to face with her and apologizing?  Nope, not at all!  I hate when I do things and then regret them!  I mean I am sure everyone does, but just the feeling I have right now.  I hate it!  I feel miserable.  And all I want to do is fix it, but now it's 11:30 p.m. and I can't call there and talk to her.    We are both the exact same person and that's why we get into these dumb fights!  I will call her tomorrow!  Life is too short to be fighting with your parents!  Going to bed!  Night!

      I find myself engrossed in other people's blogs, sometimes even stranger's blogs.  I have no idea who some of these people are, but I find myself relating to them, and reading as if I know them.   Right now I am hurting...I am wondering what I am doing, and why I am doing it.  They say your twenties are when you find yourself, when you learn who you are.  I would like to say I know who I am, but I honestly don't.  I know who I want to be, but I am not sure how to get there.  I know what kind of relationships I want to have with people, and with God, but I am not sure how to go about it.  I say I am always myself no matter who I am with, but I am not so sure I really like myself sometimes.  Or maybe I don't like the "myself" that I think I am being.  Maybe that's not really me....but what is?   Ok, now that I have totally confused myself, I will move on.  What I am trying to get at, but is so hard for me to say, is once again, I have neglected my relationship with God.  For some reason I just realized today that I have not prayed, or even thought about praying, and to admit that I haven't been and have not reason hurts, it hurts because I know God is waiting for me to realize this.  I have not been talking with God even though I know that's what helps me get through.  I have no excuse...I have absolutely no reason as to why I have been this way.  I guess not facing all the things I do wrong on a daily basis is a reason.   I really feel like a lost soul right now...I mean a lot of things have fallen into place for me in the last couple months, but I have been selfishly wanting more.  I get that, and I want more.  I could go on for hours, but I will stop right here.  Too many thoughts swirling around in my head to put them all down right now!

      I am somewhat homesick right now. I guess just feeling a bit lonely actually. I went for a walk today, and I just don't like the neighborhoods I have walked in so far. But I am too intimidated, for some reason, to walk through the new subdivisions in my neighborhood. I have no idea why. But anyway, this all makes me miss walking back home. I miss seeing people I know drive by and wave at me. I miss coming home and calling my friends to see what's going on, because I have all this energy to expend. I am not saying I want to move back by any means, but I am just saying that is one thing I miss. It's the little things!

      I wish just one month I didn't stress over bills.  But I know it will be that way for the rest of my life.  That is the only reason I would want to be rich.  To be able to pay my bills, and not worry about having money left over to last until my next paycheck.  That's not too selfish is it?   My birthday was yesterday.  It's funny how as you get older, you really don't care about your birthdays anymore.  As far as I'm concerned I am still 25.  And I am going to stay 25 as long as possible.....whatever, who am I kidding?   Anyway, let's just say that turning another year older has made me realize some things, and I need to set some goals, and start accomplishing them!  Enough said!
