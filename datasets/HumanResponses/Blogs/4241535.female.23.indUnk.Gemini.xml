      first of all i want to ask this question to the guys. What size do u like ur woman to be? Why?   why is it that most guys like skinny women? not that i have anything against skinny women, but i'm thick and proud of it. no i'm not fat, and no i'm not skinny. the world today just makes me mad. it makes me really think. it seems like u have to be a "perfect" size, and no meat on ur bones. then ppl wonder y 12 year olds r starving themselves or puking everything up or in worse cases both. that's what scares me i have 4 nieces and i don't want them to kill themselves just to be the "perfect" size. just like barbie she's supposely the "perfect" woman. in my eyes there's no such thing as "perfect" and if there was i wouldn't want to be.  when i look in the mirror i'm happy with what i see. but some ppl might say i'm fat. well if u r one of those fuckers it's simple don't look at me!!! lol duh i don't wear clothes that r too tight or small i wear things that fit me or big on me depending what mood i'm in. u don't have to show skin to be sexy, just keep that in mind. well i think i'm done now. sry if i offend anybody.   i'm outtie

            Yeah I know every1 has their own meaning of friendship. But what It means to me is a lot. First, It's someone that I can totally trust that I can tell my deepest darkest secrets. Someone that I'm not scared to tell that I'm scared. It's someone that i can laugh with, and cry with.         I myself only have a few friends. I've learned that u can't just trust someone they have to earn it. That may sound harsh, but I've had "friends" fuck me over. They have fucked me over for stupid shit like guys or something like that. Which is really fucked up cuz like guys say "Bros b4 Hos" well us women say "Hos b4 Bros", but not all women take that serious. Yes I know that ppl want to spend time with their other half. But u don't have to totally ditch ur friends. I've also had "friends" fuck my exes, well in my eyes u don't cross that line. Don't talk shit about ppl behind their backs if u r mad or upset with someone tell them. If u don't then things can get really ugly. Some ppl say they r ur "friend" but end up fuckin u over more then ur enemy. Don't let "friends" walk all over u. If u start feeling used get the fuck away from them. U don't need someone like that.                                               *ANYWAYS*         A friend is someone that will always help u when u r in trouble. IF u need money or a place to stay or even help moving. Someone that u can call when u r having a bad day or just can't sleep. Someone who can make u smile when u r cryin or just don't feel like smiling. U know by saying something funny or making that monkey face.LOL When u call them they know what excatly to say to make everything ok again. When u call them and say "I need u now" they leave a party to get over there as fast as they can. Basiclly someone u can lean on during good times and bad times.         I just want to say thanks to all my friends who've helped me stay sane. I love u guys!!!!!!                       P.S. to my closest friends I hope i can always return the favs u have done for me. Daniel(hubby) Andria(for the monkey faces) and Larry(for being one of my brides maids)
