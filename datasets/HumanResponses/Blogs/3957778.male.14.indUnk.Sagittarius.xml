      Race four was for two year fillies&nbsp;maidens going five and a half furlongs. In this one there is a lot of contenders and they are difficult to separate. Lady Carmen has had one race, at Churchill Downs,&nbsp; she finished fourth with a 54 beyer. She goes out for the Asmussen barn and you must respect her connections. Spun Sugar will be the likely favorite going out for the Plecther barn. She has had amazing workouts and Plecther wins twenty-one percent with his first time starters. Virbant was green in her debut finishing fourth. She gets lasix today and Bill Mott is twenty-two percent with his second time starters. Comacina was third in her debut and then third in the Astoria. She has a bullet workout here&nbsp;of 47 and 4 going the fastest of fourty seven on Sunday. Show Me The Town lost by a head when she debuted&nbsp;in a $80,000&nbsp;maiden claiming race. In her second race she lost by three fourths of a length in a regular maiden race and earned beyer of 77. Song'n Dance, is trained by D. Wayne Lukas, finished third her her only race only losing by a length and&nbsp;for that effort she earned a 77 beyer. Today she gets lasix for the first time, so thats who i'll go with. I would use an exacta box with Spun Sugar and Song'n Dance. On my pick six ticket I would use Spun Sugar, Comacina, and Song'n Dance. Some good money could be made off of this race.&nbsp;

      Congrats to Johny Velazquez for his 3,000 win.  Race 3 : I'm going&nbsp;to take a shot at being the&nbsp;probable favorite, Miss Crafty Pal. She is coming out of a $25000 claiming race in which he finished a solid third. She&nbsp;is trained by Allen Iwinski as she will be&nbsp;is dropping down today for $20,000.&nbsp;Another plus is John Velazquez stays aboard.&nbsp;Ms. Baker is a very good closer who defeated $25,000 claimers last year and lost only by three fourths of a length when she stepped up to face $40,000 claimers. Since then she has not raced since last December fifth and switched trainers from Julian Canet to Steve Klesaris which is a plus. Klesaris is winning at a twenty-two percent clip for the first race when he is the new trainer.&nbsp;A big neagtive is that Ms. Banker has only shown two workouts in seven months and it is unlikely she&nbsp;fit enough to win this race.&nbsp;Tree Lover is the one i'll try to beat Miss Crafty Pal, as long as&nbsp;Tree Lover's odds are better than Miss Crafty Pal. Tree Lover is exiting a race, at the same level as today, down at Gulfstream Park. She won by two and a half and earned the best beyer, this field has ever seen, a 73. That was on March seventennth so she has a better chance of not "bouncing" today.

      The fifth race was a maiden for state-bred&nbsp;fillies and mares three years old and upward going seven furlongs. My selection was Rumba Numba, she is trained br Ramon Hernandez anf ridden by Pablo Fragoso. Her last race was her second race off of a layoff going seven furlongs at Belmont Park. She finished fourth and today is getting blinkers for the first time. Hope's Diamond's last four beyer figures have in increased&nbsp;every time. She was second last time out and should be the favorite today. Exacta Box 3-7

      Race One : This one is a steeplechase, so i'll just go with the favorite.  Race Two : The first of the two state bred madien races. I like the two horse, Storm Boot Gold with Prado riding and Contessa training. He exits a race, the same level as this one, where he was a good second. He set the pace and held on for place in his first race with blinkers. Some other good angles : Prado stays on, second off a layoff, and a bullet workout since his last race. I think Runingforpresident could get up for second, he showed speed in his second race and missed by a head. This time it will be his second race off a layoff and with Pletcher-Velazquez he has a shot.  I'll post the rest of my picks throughout the day.

      Welcome to Triple Crown Racing, a blog completely devoted to horse racing. So with a site about racing I'm going to have to write about the opening day at Saratoga. The track was muddy and it gave an advantage to horses with early speed with three winners going gate to wire.&nbsp; It was a great opening day card that would have been better if there was racing on the turf.   When I originally opened my Racing Form to the first race I thought it was a wide open race. Unfortunately the race was taken off the turf and the majority of the field scratched. I liked the favorite Angelina J and with the jockey switch to Jerry Bailey, I felt pretty confident&nbsp;about my selection.&nbsp; Angelina J faded to fifth and ruined my daily double.&nbsp;  In the second race, my selection was Toscani. Toscani's last two races were very interesting. After a five month layoff he came back to&nbsp;demolish $25,ooo claimers, at Delaware Park,&nbsp;by nine and a quarter lengths earning a 105 beyer speed figure.&nbsp; He had never even come close to a 105 beyer, so it looked like it was a fluke.&nbsp; He came back sixteen days later in a second level allowance race and won again this time by four and a quarter lengths. This time his beyer was 98; this means the 105 was not&nbsp;a fluke and he learned something during that layoff.&nbsp; Toscani was also about to run on a track that was muddy and sealed, which usually does early speed a world of good.&nbsp; Toscani made the early lead and went on to win by two paying $6.80. Toscani is a horse I am going to look for in the future.  The third race was for state-bred maidens. My selection was Creative Dance. &nbsp;He showed&nbsp;speed&nbsp;in each of his four lifetime starts, and was one of only two horses&nbsp;to have raced prior to today.&nbsp; Most recently, he ran in a maiden race on the turf going a mile at Belmont Park. He set the pace to the stretch and faded to fifth.&nbsp; None of the first time starters went out for trainers with a good first start percentage rate, so I went with Creative Dance for Ramon Hernandez with Pablo Fragoso.&nbsp; Creative Dance made the early lead and went to win by&nbsp;two paying $9.60.   The fourth race was a third level allowance race for four year olds and upward. The race&nbsp;was taken off the turf and the field scatched down to six. There was three horses I thought would dominate the field, and so did the betting public. I went for the favorite, Admiralty Arch.&nbsp; Admiralty Arch was coming off a half a length defeat, at the same level and distance, to Powerful Touch ( Jerry Bailey and Bobby Frankel)&nbsp;who was racing in todays eigth race. For that effort he earned a 99 beyer. It was tough for me to separate Upturn, Admiralty Arch, and Seek Gold but when it is tough for me to separate horses I go to plan B. &nbsp;Plan B is to pick the horse with the best connections out of the horses I can't separate by their past performances.&nbsp; Upturn won by a head but after bumping Admiralty Arch at the top of the stretch, the stewards disqualified Upturn and placed him second and Admiralty Arch first. The pick three paid $106.50.  The fifth race was for two year old maidens. This field was very deep with trainers such as Pletcher, Frankel, Lukas, Mott, Hough, and Asmussen.&nbsp; My selection,&nbsp;Shark looked solid with one start when he set the pace and came out with a second place finish.&nbsp; He was getting lasix for the first time and trained beautifully for this race including two bullet workouts.&nbsp; Malheur was also training well for Todd Pletcher and John Velazquez.&nbsp; Shark never got the lead and finished seven. Malheur finished second and Royal Moment won.&nbsp; Royal Moment had been training well for Steve Asmussen and was ridden by Shane Sellers. &nbsp;Asmussen is a killer with horses starting for the first time winning at a 26 percent clip.   The sixth race was a second level allowance race for three year olds and upward.&nbsp; In this race, on paper, there were three, maybe four, contenders. &nbsp;Coded Warning, another&nbsp;with Bailey-Frankel connections, is one of my favorite horses.&nbsp; Ever since his second&nbsp;lifetime start at Aqueduct on Wood Memorial day, I have watched him closely. He had won his last start in a first level entry race and would have to step up to win this one.&nbsp; Golden Look was another contender who last time out was beaten by Medallist by eighteen and three quarter lenghts. Breakaway was the maybe, he was fourth in the Louisana Derby and fifth in the Blue Grass but since then he failed to win at this level at Churchill Downs. &nbsp;He was given a layoff&nbsp;from May twentieth until now.&nbsp; This speed favoring mud would not help his chances either.&nbsp; Stratostar was another contender who won a first level allowance race and came back to be a solid third in the Black Tie Affair Handicap losing to Alumni Hall. &nbsp;Lusty Latin won, a horse that looked like he could barely beat the maidens in the last race let alone these horses, but that's horse racing. Also Lusty Latin was at sixth place at one point in the race, so it didn't look like the track was favoring speed as much as it was earlier.   Race seven was taken off the turf as a first level allowance race run at seven furlongs. Scratches left the field with eigth horses one who went off at four to five.&nbsp; Guide was the overwelming favorite going out for Bill Mott and&nbsp;to be&nbsp;ridden by Jerry Bailey.&nbsp; With this field the favorite should have been about five to two, not less than even money.&nbsp; I didn't like Guide much but I couldn't find a horse to beat him so I went with him.&nbsp; Mariakel won by a little less than four and payed $30.20.   The eighth race could have been mistaken for the feature race on a weekday at Belmont Park but this is Saratoga.&nbsp; Powerful Touch and Colita fought for favoritism before the race and it was&nbsp;tough separating the two.&nbsp; Powerful Touch was the classic combo of Bailey-Frankel versus Colita who was Pletcher-Velazquez. Colita had come off a nine month layoff to dead heat with Pretty Wild in a fourth level allowance.&nbsp; Colita earned an impressive 105 beyer in that race. Powerful Touch was coming off a much less taxing&nbsp;effort,&nbsp;a third level allowance victory.&nbsp; I didn't think Colita could repeat that 105 beyer and how could you go wrong with Bailey and Frankel. Powerful Touch won by a neck and payed $5.50.   The ninth race was the feature race, the grade two Schuylerville for fillies two years old. Broadway Gold was the favorite and deserved to be.&nbsp; She won her maiden by eleven and then won the Astoria.&nbsp; She is trained by Stanley Hough and ridden by Jerry Bailey. &nbsp;I also liked Darn That Girl who&nbsp;won her maiden in her second try with a 89 beyer.&nbsp; Angel Trumpet got the early lead and finished second only to be passed by Classic Elegance who appeared to be flying to the wire but really all the other horses in were really slowing down. She payed $7.80 as the second choice.  The finale was a claiming event from $50,00 down to $40,000. I liked number seven Lucky Guy trained by Allen Iwinski and ridden by John Velazquez. He was coming out of a simlar race, $40,000 down to $30,000 at Belmont which he won by one and a quarter lenghts. Even though he earned a beyer of 84 ( 24 points better that his last effort) I believed he could run an 84 again because he had run a 80 before and now he is trained by Allen Iwinski instead of Frank Gomez. He when on to win by three and paid $12.40.  I'll be back tomorrow around 12:30 with my picks for tomorrow good night and study hard.

Orpington  Gold Reserve is coming off of a victory at the same conditions as today down at Belmont Park. He got a lifetime best beyer, a 83. If he doesn't regress theres a godd chance you'll see him in the winners circle. Palm Beach Bud was third behind Gold Reserve last time out and could improve off of what was his first race on the turf. Orpington was very wide in his last start, a second place finish at Monmouth in a claiming race.

Formal Attire  Savoy Special was second to Personal Touch, who came back to win at Saratoga, gets the rail today, which shouldn't hurt his chances that much because he has good speed. Country Judge was second, to Eye of the Tiger who came back to beat Olmodavor and Colonial Colony, his his last. Formal Attire has been stakes placed in his career and has good beyer numbers.  $2 Pick 4 1,5-1,3,8-1,8-1,5,8 = $72 $5 win on Savoy Special

He's Crafty  L'Oiseau d'Argent has good speed and the cutback back in distance should help. Third Half is trained by Bobby Frankel and is coming off of a impressive victory down at Belmont Park. He's Crafty is coming off of a layoff, which is when he runs well.  $5 win on L'Oiseau d'Argent $2 Pick 3 1,3,8-1,8-1,5,8 = $36

So Sweet a Cat has never gone father than 7 furlongs, but she is the most talented horse in the field. Raf's Society Girl has won two in a row at Finger Lakes with decent beyer numbers.

      Race 1 : Steeplechase Claiming Price $35,000 2 1/16 miles on the turf  I'll skip this race since it is a steeplechase.  Race 2 : Claiming Price $20,000 1 3/16 miles  1. Gail's Drive 2. Act of Reform 3. Cold Blow Lane  Gail's Drive last race was on May 2oth when he beat $20,000 to $18,000 claimers. That victory was coming off a layoff, so theres no prombblem with that layoff. Act of Reform came back from a layoff on July 18th when he finished second by a head and should improve off of that race. Cold Blow Lane is going turf to dirt and hasn't won in a while, so i'll put him in the third spot.  $5 exacta box Gail's Drive-Act of Reform = $10 $2 Pick 3 4,6-1,7,8,9-1,4,6 = $48  Race 3 : Maiden Special Weight for two year olds 5 furlongs  1. Storied Cat 2. Ready To Flee 3. Tani Maru  Storied Cat lost by a length in his debut at Churchill, he gets lasix today, has been working bullets when just breezing, and Bailey rides for Lukas. Ready to Flee has a couple of bullet workouts and hes going out for Steve Asmussen, who wins 25 percent with first time starters. Asmussen and Sellers are 2 for 9 this meet. Tani Maru comes up here from Calder where trainer Ed Plesa is based. He wouldn't send this one up here if he didn't think he was talented.  $2 exacta box 1,7,8,9 = $24  Race 4 : Claiming $40,000 down to $35,000 for fillies 1 1/16 miles on the turf  1. Moorebella 2. Uma Norma 3. Barn Dance  Moorebella has been consistant on the turf for the past serveral months and goes out for Graham Motion who wins with 22 percent of his horses on the turf. Uma Norma has good beyer numbers when on the turf and has not "bounced" when shes on the turf, but all of those races have been in maiden races. Barn Dance won last time out in $40,000 claiming race at Monmouth.  $5 on Moorebella to win

      Race 6 : For fillies and mares three years old and upward which have never won a race other than maiden, claiming, or starter 1/16 miles on the turf  1. Plenty 2. Cozy Cay 3. High Speed Access  Plenty has shown very good speed in her two lifetime races on the turf, particularly in her last start. In her last set set fast fractions of :22 and one, :45, and 1:09 and one. She lost by a nose in that one and today Bailey rides. Her speed should get her out of the number 10 post position, so I'm not too worried about the post. Cozy Cay was second in the same conditions as today on the turf. Her last was on the turf and should be in the exacta. High Speed Access has been very good in her last two coming in second and third.  $1 trifecta box 3,4,6,7,10 = $60 $2 Pick Four 4,7,10-1,3,4-4-3,7 = $36 $10 Plenty to win

      Race 8 : The second running of the New York Stallion. $250,000 added 1 1/8 miles  1. West Virginia 2. Chowder's First 3. Pay Attention  West Virginia is the class of the field and should beat these by 10 lengths. His beyers don't compare with anyone elses, he has a bullet workout since his last race, and he is trained by Todd Pletcher. Chowder's First was third in a similar race in April at the big A but since then hes only had one good race. Pay Attention is part of an entry who hasn't done much since coming in second in that similar race in April.  $10 Double 4-3  Race 9 : For state bred maidens three years old and upward. 1 1/16 miles on the turf  1. Dixie Baghdad 2. Cannonball Rock 3. My Man Alex  Dixie Baghdad was close to the lead in his first turf race and finished sixth. He should dominate this field with Jose Espinoza aboard. Cannonball Rock was second in his only turf race and got a 59 beyer. My Man Alex showed good speed in his last race on the turf, so if he doesn't tire he could get in the trifecta.  $20 Dixie Baghdad to win $5 Exacta Dixie Baghdad with everyone = $60

      With a little less than a week away from the Haskell and Jim Dandy, the traditional preps for the Travers, i'll try to separate the contenders from non-contenders for the upcoming second half of the three year old season.     Rock Hard Ten   Rock Hard Ten has only had six lifetime starts, three of them victorys. He started his career by breaking his maiden and then winning a non-winners of one race. Then, even though he lost by a neck in the Santa Anita Derby, to Castledale, and disqualified to third he was very impressive in what was only his third lifetime start. He could not make it into the Kentucky Derby due to insufficient earnings. He next started in the Preakness where he finished second, losing by eleven and a half lengths. Then in the Belmont, he was close to the lead early and tired finishing fifth twelve lengths behind. He came back with a impressive three and three quarter lentghs victory in the Swaps at Hollywood Park. Rock Hard Ten is a huge horse with a lot of ability who should be one of the horses trying to be the best three year old in the country with Smarty Jones's recent retirement. Distance won't matter to this colt because he has a great pedigree. He is set to return in the Haskell set at 1 1/8 miles and should be a huge threat in his races in the future.   Lion Heart     Lion Heart is a very fast colt, maybe too fast for his own good. Lion Heart started his career with victorys in a maiden race, the Hollywood Prevue, and the Hollwood Futurity. When he made his return as a three year old in the San Rafael, he was part of a very fast pace and lost by a neck to Imperialism. Then in the Blue Grass at Keeneland he set another fast pace and again came in second to The Cliff's Edge. In the Kentucky Derby he set the pace and finished (you guessed it) second to Smarty Jones. He was sent to the Preakness to challenge Smarty Jones, but after setting the pace he faced to fourth losing by thirteen and a half lengths showing signs that he was tired. He was given a break and returned in the Long Branch Breeders' Cup, the prep for the Travers, where he finished first finishing by a head after a long stretch duel with My Snookie's Boy. He is pointing to the Haskell and then the Travers. Lion Heart's pedigree says he can only go a mile, but Lion Heart has shown a lot of heart and with a second place finish in the Kentucky Derby at 1 1/4 miles he has shown he has the ability of out running his pedigree. It should be a good matchup with Rock Hard Ten on Sunday and could steal the race if there is a advantage to front runners but I think Rock Hard Ten will get the best of him Sunday.   Royal Assault    This colt is a good horse, but just not as good as the top three year olds. On Preakness Day he won the ungraded Sir Barton and then came back to run third in the Belmont. In the Long Branch Breeders' Cup he finished third. His beyer speed figures have never been up to par with the rest of the top three year olds. He is pointing to the Haskell and I think he'll be third or fourth. The rest of the year he will have to improve greatly to have a chance versus these horses.   The Cliff's Edge     Over the spring this colt went from Nick Zito's third string to his first string. In his first start as a three year old he came in second in a small stakes race at Tampa. Then in the Florida Derby he was a good second and got a 90 beyer for that effort. Then in the Blue Grass he was very impressive in his victiory over Lion Heart and with that effort he was the Kentucky Derby morning line favorite. He lost two shoes in the Derby and finished fifth. He came back in the Dwyer at Belmont Park. He was very far back early and finished second. He should improve off of that effort in the Jim Dandy. He is a very consistant and have a good effort lined up for Sunday. He had a very nice workout at the Spa on Saturday, which a private clocker, who watched The Cliff's Edge train in Kentucky this spring said the work was reminiscent of the one The Cliff's Edge put in prior to his win in the Blue Grass Stakes. He may even be a factor in the Breeders' Cup Classic.   Medallist     I am one of this colts big fans after his effort in the Dwyer. Medallist set a fast pace and won the Withers at Aqueduct on Derby Day and got a 110 beyer. He set another blazing pace in the Dwyer and held on to win. He is now pointing to the Jim Dandy but did not have a good workout on Friday going a mile. Trainer Allen Jerkens said he could skip the race but he is considering working Medallist on Tuesday, and if the horse works well, he will run in Jim Dandy. The Jim Dandy will be his first time going around two turns.   Birdstone     Birdstone showed a lot of talent as a two year old and was having a bad three year old campaign until the Belmont Stakes. He won the Champagn as a two year old and showed promise. He hasn't done anything as a three year old besides the Belmont. He is training up to the Travers because he runs better with rest. He will be overbet based on his Belmont victory. In the Belmont Smarty was tiring and Birdstone wasn't excellerating as much as it looked. His beyers don't match up with the rest of these and will have to improve.   Eddington     This colt often loses focus in his races and has not hit his peak. Eddington was third in the Gotham, Wood Memorial, and Preakness. In the Belmont he was asked for run on the backstretch and tired.
