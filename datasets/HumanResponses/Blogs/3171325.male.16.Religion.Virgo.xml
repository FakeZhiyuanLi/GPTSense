      Bold is Commentary  Malachi 1:7 and 8 "{You} are presenting defiled food upon My altar. But you say, 'How have we defiled You?' In that you say, 'The table of the LORD is to be despised.' "But when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil? Why not offer it to your governor? Would he be pleased with you? Or would he receive you kindly?" says the LORD of hosts.   When we get together to worship, we need to put our selfish ambitions aside so that we can truly worship the Lord and put his goals and purposes above our own.  When we try to get something for ourselves out of worship, it takes away from giving to God.  Worship is supposed to give glory to God, not to bring glory to ourselves.    Psalm 54:6 and 7 Willingly I will sacrifice to You; I will give thanks to Your name, O LORD, for it is good. For He has delivered  me from all trouble, And my eye has looked {with satisfaction} upon my enemies.   Not only is this a great example of an offering that God would find acceptable, it also shows us that there is absolutely no reason for us not to offer up our best to the Good Shepard.    Proverbs 19:21  You can make many plans, but the LORD's purpose will prevail.  Psalm 57:2  I cry out to God Most High, to God who will fulfill his purpose for me.   If we align ourselves with God’s will for this bible study/worship, then God will bless us.   We should follow God’s lead, wherever he may take us.    Philipians 2:1-4 Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.  Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.   Ephesians 4:1-3 Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.    Unity is crucial to acting as the body of Christ.  In unity, God can use us in awesome ways that he can’t if we are divided.    John 4:23-24 "But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.  God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."  Word up.   Ephesians 5:1-5 Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.  But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints; and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.  For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.   1 Chronicles 28:9 "As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart and a willing mind; for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands every intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.    Some of us have realized that we had selfish motives and expectations that were not in line with where we should be.  We want to be focused only on honoring God, and acting in unity, we want this worship to be inclusive, leaving no one out and honoring equality among all members of the group.    John 15:9  "Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love.   Romans 8:31-39 What then shall we say to these things? If  God is for us, who is against us? He who did  not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?  Who will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who justifies; who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised,  who is at  the right hand of God, who also intercedes  for us.  Who will separate us from the  love of Christ?  Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Just as it is written, "FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED."  But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer  through Him  who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

      February 5, 2004, 2:57 AM "But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people." Ephesians 5:3-4a   1. I will devote myself to chastity.  Main Entry: chas·ti·ty Pronunciation: 'chas-t&-tE Function: noun Date: 13th century 1 : c : purity in conduct and intention © 2001 by Merriam-Webster, Incorporated  1A. I will not have sexual intercourse before I’m married. -Proverbs 6:32 But the man who commits adultery is an utter fool, for he destroys his own soul. 33 Wounds and constant disgrace are his lot. His shame will never be erased.  1B. I will not have any sexual interaction with a girl before I’m married. -1 Corinthians 6:13 The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord.   1C. I will not sexually gratify myself. I will not so much as look at or think of a girl lustfully. -Matthew 5:28 But I say, anyone who even looks at a woman with lust in his eye has already committed adultery with her in his heart.   1D. I will not question how far is too far, rather, I will question what will be best for my future.  1E. I will not be involved with pornography.    2. I will not date until I know, or think, that who I‘m dating is the person I‘m going to marry, and that I‘m ready for the commitment of marriage. -2 Timothy 2:22b Pursue faith and love and peace, and enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with pure hearts  3. I will communicate my standards.  4. I will stick to my convictions.  5. I will avoid compromising situations.  -2 Timothy 2:22a Run from anything that stimulates youthful lust. Follow anything that makes you want to do right…  6. I will save my next kiss for my wedding day.   Statement of Admission.  I have kissed. I have dated. I have been involved with pornography. I have looked at girls lustfully. I have sexually gratified myself. I have had sexual interaction with girls. I have not had sexual intercourse.   Statement of Belief.  1. God has forgiven me of past sin and impurity. -Matthew 12:31 Every sin or blasphemy can be forgiven…  2. I can stick to these standards of purity. -Mark 10:27 But Jesus looked at them and said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible."   3. Jesus was tempted sexually, and because he overcame it, He understands what I’m going through and can help me. -Hebrews 4:15,16 This High Priest of ours [Jesus] understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same temptations we do, yet he did not sin. So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it.

      Psalm 66:8 Let the whole world bless our God and sing aloud his praises. 9 Our lives are in his hands, and he keeps our feet from stumbling. 10 You have tested us, O God; you have purified us like silver melted in a crucible. 11 You captured us in your net and laid the burden of slavery on our backs. 12 You sent troops to ride across our broken bodies. We went through fire and flood. But you brought us to a place of great abundance. 13 Now I come to your Temple with burnt offerings to fulfill the vows I made to you – 14 yes, the sacred vows you heard me make when I was in deep trouble. 15 That is why I am sacrificing burnt offerings to you – the best of my rams as a pleasing aroma. And I will sacrifice bulls and goats. Interlude 16 Come and listen, all you who fear God, and I will tell you what he did for me. 17 For I cried out to him for help, praising him as I spoke. 18 If I had not confessed the sin in my heart, my Lord would not have listened. 19 But God did listen! He paid attention to my prayer. 20 Praise God, who did not ignore my prayer and did not withdraw his unfailing love from me.  Psalm 116:1 I love the LORD because he hears and answers my prayers. 2 Because he bends down and listens, I will pray as long as I have breath! 3 Death had its hands around my throat; the terrors of the grave overtook me. I saw only trouble and sorrow. 4 Then I called on the name of the LORD: "Please, LORD, save me!" 5 How kind the LORD is! How good he is! So merciful, this God of ours! 6 The LORD protects those of childlike faith; I was facing death, and then he saved me. 7 Now I can rest again, for the LORD has been so good to me. 8 He has saved me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. 9 And so I walk in the LORD's presence as I live here on earth!   John 8:1 Jesus returned to the Mount of Olives, 2 but early the next morning he was back again at the Temple. A crowd soon gathered, and he sat down and taught them. 3 As he was speaking, the teachers of religious law and Pharisees brought a woman they had caught in the act of adultery. They put her in front of the crowd. 4 "Teacher," they said to Jesus, "this woman was caught in the very act of adultery. 5 The law of Moses says to stone her. What do you say?" 6 They were trying to trap him into saying something they could use against him, but Jesus stooped down and wrote in the dust with his finger. 7 They kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, "All right, stone her. But let those who have never sinned throw the first stones!" 8 Then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust. 9 When the accusers heard this, they slipped away one by one, beginning with the oldest, until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman. 10 Then Jesus stood up again and said to her, "Where are your accusers? Didn't even one of them condemn you?" 11 "No, Lord," she said. And Jesus said, "Neither do I. Go and sin no more."  12 Jesus said to the people, "I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won't be stumbling through the darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life."   2 Timothy 2:11 This is a true saying: If we die with him, we will also live with him. 12 If we endure hardship, we will reign with him. If we deny him, he will deny us. 13 If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.   John 10:27 My sheep recognize my voice; I know them, and they follow me. 28 I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them away from me, 29 for my Father has given them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else. So no one can take them from me.  2 Chronicles 34:27 You were sorry and humbled yourself before God when you heard what I said against this city and its people. You humbled yourself and tore your clothing in despair and wept before me in repentance. So I have indeed heard you, says the LORD.   2 Corinthians 7:10 For God can use sorrow in our lives to help us turn away from sin and seek salvation. We will never regret that kind of sorrow. But sorrow without repentance is the kind that results in death.  Luke 24:47  With my authority, take this message of repentance to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem: 'There is forgiveness of sins for all who turn to me.'       1. What is stumbling? Main Entry: [1]stum·ble Pronunciation: 'st&m-b&l Function: verb Inflected Form(s): stum·bled; stum·bling /-b(&-)li[ng]/  Etymology: Middle English, probably of Scandinavian origin; akin to Norwegian dialect stumle to stumble; akin to Old Norse stemma to hinder —more at STEM  Date: 14th century intransitive senses 1 a : to fall into sin or waywardness b : to make an error : BLUNDER c : to come to an obstacle to belief  2 : to trip in walking or running  3 a : to walk unsteadily or clumsily b : to speak or act in a hesitant or faltering manner  4 a : to come unexpectedly or by chance   b : to fall or move carelessly  transitive senses 1 : to cause to stumble : TRIP  2 : BEWILDER, CONFOUND  - stum·bler /-b(&-)l&r/ noun - stum·bling·ly /-b(&-)li[ng]-lE/ adverb   2. (Psalm 66) What’s going on in my relationship with Jesus when I’m stumbling? -sometimes it’s different.  3. (Psalm 116) How do I incorporate the fact that I’m stumbling into my relationship with the Lord?  4. (John 10, John 8, 2 Timothy) Should we be afraid of our status with God when we’re stumbling?  5. (2 Chronicles, 2 Corinthians) Is excessive guilt or shame something of God?  Does it have a role in repentance?    6. (Luke 24:47) What can be done to remedy this broken relationship with God?

       Evidence that the Bible calls people to the mission field:   “Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me [or of what I have done for you and through you] and what I will show you  I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.” (Acts 26:16-18)   *What does He mean when He says “I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light…, and from the power of Satan to God”? Do you think He is insinuating that we have the authority to do that?   More verses telling Christians of their call to evangelize include:    You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.” (Matthew 5:14-16)    “Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.” (Matthew 10:32-33)    The need for missionaries, and the blessing of God to those who take an active role in spreading the Good News:    "And how shall they hear without a preacher [or How can they hear unless someone proclaims Him"]? And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: 'How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!'" (Romans 10:14-15)   *What do you think the main purposes of this passage is? 	-If needed, break into parts. The need, and the blessing.   The foolishness of evangelism pleases God!    "For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe." (1 Corinthians 1:21)    Footnote:  This does not mean we need to scream and yell and wave a Bible to get the point across. What it does mean is that we are to recognize the primary way God has chosen to reach the lost is through the proclamation of the gospel - by people. God has chosen the agency of His proclaimed Word to bring people to salvation.   After that verse, in my own paraphrase, it says that †some people will demand proof, and some will try to dispute it with logic, but we still preach Christ crucified.  †For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified

      Yes, it happened. Someone has abused the commenting system I JUST got up on here. Someone posted as "Jesus', and posted the word "whore". I tried deleting it and couldn't, so I took off the comments, retooled some codes and got comment hosting with a different provider. I now have the ability to not only delete and edit your comments, but BAN YOUR IP from commenting all together. Speaking of IP's, the person who posted that thing's IP was 205.188.117.22. Feel free to hack.  What do you think of the new banner thingy I made at the top, and the new commenting system? Let me know!

      Well, I eventually DID show up for that GED orientation doohickey. It was pretty much blah dee blah normal stuff, but what caught my attention was this: if you get certain scores, you are recognized in different ways. Like if I just barely make it, it's fine- but if I get 3000 on it, I get an honorable mention. And if I get 3200+, I'm eligable to apply for this scholarship of sorts. Cool junk, yo. Mom said she thinks I'll pass with flying colors in everything 'cept math, which is probably true. Now to find a math tutor!  I found a class in the community education section of the SPSCC course catalog about learning to do Flash Animation. I asked my mom about it, and she said she would pay for it and everything. WHA?! I decided I'll start out in some Photoshop classes first, then move on to flash :o)~. Exciting stuff!  I got my Zim DVD *woot woot*! I would have had it earlier, AND would have been able to go to uturn if it weren't for TORI!!!! Yeah, you heard me.  But anyway, it's freaking awesome. I'm twitching as i type, need to go watch, morrrrre...... G2G!!!

       urlLink     I wish to kill.  "E" is at it again. A night or two ago, I invited E and Jeff and Keegan in to watch an episode of Invader Zim that a neat-o person sent me. I got out of the car, and Jeff and the gang were all looking at me. Jeff was going off on a wee little rant on how the conversation needs to end and blah blah blah. I stand there in an utter state of confusion, as I thought "the conversation" (which was E saying Outkast is musically better than Squad Five-O and Me laughing because it was a dumb thing to say since rap isn't really music, approx. 2 minutes prior to this.. whatever it is) ended. Alright, I thought. Jeff just misunderstood what happened, and thought that there was tension building when there wasn't. Then E opens his mouth. "Yeah, I was going on the defense".   I later talked to Jeff. In not as many/the same words, what I had speculated had been true. Jeff went on the happy rant because E is an idiot and was going to get defensive and throw a temper tantrum. This ticks me off. I was unfairly jumped on... because poor poopy-pants was probably going to get offended over something that wasn't even offendable to the normal human being. I'm sorry, but that is HIS problem, not mine, and HE should get reprimanded for his stupidity. I'm not going to take that crap. And as far as I'm concerned, E can stay far away from me, because all he does is cause and start trouble. I hate how everything I'm involved in HAS to include him, because then he's unavoidable! Then again, I could always do THIS to him:     In other news, Invader Zim Vol. 1 is officially going to be released in 14 days. Hot Topic is releasing it early, probably today. If you live near a Hot Topic, then call to see if it's in stock. If not, go pre-order it  urlLink here . I drew a picture of this dude in Invader Zim, a classmate of his. It's my first good try at drawing, so I'm proud. No, the comic in this post isn't considered a good try at drawing... although it IS funny.

      Now, I think a lot of people know, that I like to over analyze things. Allow me to do so.    Disclaimer: I don't actually think some of these things, I'm just processing the thoughts and ideas.    Today, kiddies, we're going to talk about Christian culture. Yes, that's right- culture. Commercialized people who all eat, breathe, and think the same way. Just like there is an athletic culture, a gothic culture, animation culture, punk culture, etc. Most people would agree that Christianity has recently fallen into the hands of commercialism.  Now, if I haven't convinced you about that, then how about this. It is a standard by many Christians that rated 'R' movies are BAD. Bad, bad bad. Understandable. Excessive violence, sexuality, etc. is not a good thing to be pumping into minds that are trying to think and be more like that of Christ's.   But then the Passion of the Christ comes out, an elegant portrayal of Christ's death (and about a second of His resurrection). The movie is gory, probably more violent than the most violent horror movie, unyet it's acceptable simply because their fellow churchgoers are approving of it. It's been marked 'OK' because Jesus stars in it (not literally). But is it morally more acceptable to watch than another gory movie simply because the culture okays it.  Next example, would be that of the very acceptable Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is a secular movie, with violence. It's fantasy and there are underlinings of Biblical metaphors and concepts. But it's more acceptable to watch than the Matrix trilogy, which is also all of those things, because the author of the books was a Christian.  I'd like to just say, that I have nothing against any of these movies. The Passion of the Christ is the most powerful drama I've ever witnessed, The Lord of the Rings trilogy surpasses that of any movie in all time, and the Matrix is a brilliant exciting trilogy. All of these movies, to me, have provided spiritual understanding and have inspired me to think about spirituality in ways I could have never imagined on my own.  My whole purpose is just to let off some steam, and to understand my mind better.   Commercialism is blinding many beilevers and would-be believers with products and interests that are far different than even what we should be focusing on. There are probably many unsaved people out there who think they're saved simply because they are caught up in a Jesusified commercial culture that is masking salvation as going to youth group, listening to Christian music and watching Left Behind. There are also probably many saved people that are so distracted by these things, that they aren't getting the full personal experience with Christ that they could be getting.  Note that I have focused on two entirely different topics. I did blend them into the same post, but the two are entirely different. (Doing things that other Christians do that would normally be unacceptable to you versus distractions from your walk with God by commercialism)  Disagree? Agree?

      It never ceases to amaze me that, even though the e-mail was sent that I'm not one to talk to people about band problems any longer, I still get hammered with a ridiculous pressure to talk about the stupidity in which is now our band. In case you don't know, radialangel7 is me. If you know me, then I'm sure you can figure out who 'e' is.  e: plus, i don't think i'm gonna play in the band anymore e: i'll still come but just participate in the bible study e: are you there? rADIALaNGEL7: why so? e: i am just sick of it e: it's not fun anymore rADIALaNGEL7: mariah quit... e: for now anyway e: why? e: was it the email? rADIALaNGEL7: many reasons. i'd rather not discuss it e: why.  it effects me just as much as you e: have i any less right to know e: i think not rADIALaNGEL7: yes. she didn't tell you, she told me e: but hey. rADIALaNGEL7: i'm not going to disgrace her privacy e: don't be rude e: well, was it because of me? e: if it was tell me rADIALaNGEL7: eh, not so much. e: cause that is a bad reason, and i am quitting anyway rADIALaNGEL7: before being rash, lets discuss at our next meeting e: rash? e: how? e: i might not be there e: i haven't decided rADIALaNGEL7: well that decision is up to you. e: why are you being a jerk about this? e: what's gotten into you? rADIALaNGEL7: because i've gotten enough crap about the band recently rADIALaNGEL7: i don't really like talking about it e: you are really acting srange e: oh, i'm sorry that i bunch of people don't like it.  can i do ANYTHING about that? e: no e: i cant e: so dont take it out on me e: please rADIALaNGEL7: i'm not. i just don't want to talk about these things rADIALaNGEL7: you're not respecting that e: that is taking it out on me e: you are punishing me for what has been said to you by not talking to me about it e: it's that simple rADIALaNGEL7: i'm not punishing you. i don't want to talk about it with anyone. rADIALaNGEL7: if i was punishing you for my frustrations, i'd be yelling at you, cursing you, etc. e: what happened to the days when we used to talk about everything? e: oh  e: that's right e: torie came along rADIALaNGEL7: simply not talking about it is a right that i have. e: and i started to ignore you [what? for it seemed to me that the opposite was true] rADIALaNGEL7: and tori has nothing to do with anything we're talking about e: and we never fully recovered e: can i call you? rADIALaNGEL7: sure. e: cool e: bye rADIALaNGEL7: bye

      Okay, I just rejected the opportunity to go to the mandatory GED test orientation *hits forehead*. Reason: I'm tired! It's 7:01AM and I've yet to sleep. This sleep-in-the-day, thrive in the night routine is... ruining everything! Will I ever live again?

      May I rant? Please? Oh of course I can... because with Blogger, you people can't comment on what I say. Oh the joy in knowing I have full control over you people.  I'm involved with this little band, simply titled (at the moment)  urlLink Saturday Worship Band . Now, I hate to sound like this super-leader-guy, but I envisioned this band... and the vision was not that it would be a band at all! It was that we'd come together as a group of people who want to worship God, and focus simply on doing that. Recently, things have gone out of whack with people getting mad at eachother and people confusing the actual purpose of our group. The original purpose has been compared to "60's hippy junk" and the like, and people have been fighting with me, trying to tell me that the group's purpose is something that it's not. I was about to go insane until I sent out an e-mail (per Jeff's suggestion) restating Jeff's leadership role and that if anyone has issues with the band they need to consult him. Happy I be. Hooray. Things are cooling off, and hopefully we can reinstate the original purpose.  In other news, I just recently joined the message boards at  urlLink badbadrubberpiggy.com . In fact, you (the reader) may very well could have come from there! I welcome you to my bloggy blog. If you've never been there, join/read the forum, and look for posts by !*fate as thos're from me.  Peace out, chubbykins.

      Well hello world. Today was an amazing day! I woke up.. oh say, 3PM? Talked on the phone... went on the computer... am still on the computer... UGH. I hate my skin. I wish my skin wasn't human skin at all, I wish it was marshmellow skin. Marshmellow skin would at least be sugary and taste yummy.   Now, I'm very impatiently anxious for the Invader ZiM DVD release " urlLink Doom, doom, doom ". Now, odds are, you're saying... "What? Zim? Huh?". You idiot. Now, pre-order the DVD this very minute.   I have to go now. Have a lovely day full of love and joy and stuff. Oink!

      These are things I go through. Does anybody else?  It feels like when I try to talk to someone about Christ, or when others talk about it, people stare at me/them like they are crazy and change the subject. And I'm talking about believers.  It troubles me. I sometimes wonder if I'm the only one that's really taking my faith seriously. During the alter call at Big Splash, within my youth group, one person was talking very loudly on their cell phone, and another was mimicking everything the pastor said. Slightly inappropriate timing.  I don't know. I just feel like I can't identify with other believers sometimes, and the ones I feel I can identify with don't talk to me very much. I don't know, maybe it's just the believers I hang around.

         I'm so excited about  urlLink Big Splash  that I can't sleep!!  It's going on today... I'm meeting at New Bridge at 8AM for us to leave to it. It's a concert at a Six Flags with Skillet, Pillar, Grits, Souldeep and a bunch of local bands. Dude it's going to be off the hizzy! I'm so prepared for it, too. I got my digital camera, sunblock, skin creams, all my clothes picked out, lunch all packed up. Now I'm supposed to sleep?! SLEEP?!!! How can one sleep at a time like this?  I do know this for sure: I'm stopping at Starbucks on the way there. Quad shot. That's right.   Coffee. MmMmMmMmmm.  I'll post up a gallery of Big Splash Pix's when I get around to it. I used to have last years on a website, but my buddy Eli published his website over it and erased 'em all. Grr. I hope I have that picture disc around here somewhere!  Anyway, I'm out. God bless! †

      Commentary: I'm posting this because it's my only recent poem. While I'm sure every entry to Poetry.com gets these things, it was published in a book, deemed Editor's Choice, and is going to be read on a poetry reading CD. Yeah. Do I get paid for it? Of course not.  He walks in circles, Never knowing why. He feels the pain of sharp objects, cutting him deep. He walks under a bridge, and gets mugged by the enemies. He doesn't know himself, He dies, dying, dead.  He walks straight ahead, So confident now. He feels the pain of sharp objects, breaking him, breaking him. He walks over a bridge, head high, bearing a tree. He knows Someone, He dies, living life.  Joseph Thomas Cristina  Copyright ©2004 Joseph Thomas Cristina

      I just played "The Doubtful Guest" by Calibretto, and my little brother exclaimed as he laughed, "Turn that off! It reminds me of a creepy smiling fat clown skipping and jumping with cupcakes in his hands!"  Thought I'd share that with you. Haha!  Today I was my first driver's ed class. IT SUCKED! I was crammed in a small, non-air conditioned room with a bunch of annoying distracting teenagers... and I was copying answers down to questions I didn't even know, and the guy was saying them SUPER fast. We then took a 'quiz' at the end... I didn't know most of these answers. I cheated :(.   This is what I get for $265?   Tomorrow: DOL to renew permit at 2:45, driver's ed from 4-6, youth group 7-9. Happy joys.   I have an awesome friend named Jessicle. Everybody comment on this post and tell Jessicle how awesome she is and how much you LOOOOVE her. BYE!

      Okay, if you've been following my blog the past few days, then you know what this post is going to be about :) If you haven't, backtrack to "Meeting with Pastor Mark" and read on.  I sent out that post to a bunch of people who go to New Bridge, to announce my departure from New Bridge. Apparently, the e-mail made more than one person uneasy. Faye was the only to respond via e-mail. While I'd like to post exactly what she said, I haven't had permission to do so, so I won't. The summary would be, she concerned that I'd be leaving for the wrong reasons, and that I'd be leaving with bitterness towards New Bridge (there's more to it than that, I'm doing the best I can). And as much as I tried to refute those claims, and when I came to my own mental conclusion, the same concern arose today at church when Eddy and Chase pulled me aside for a long time to talk with me.   To make a long story short because I'm lazy and don't want to type for an hour explaining all of the details, Faye was absolutely correct in her concern. A few posts back, "Response to a Person", was example of my unwillingness to listen to the possibility that I was leaving because of reasons that aren't blessed by God (bitterness, unreal expectations, not patiently following God's timeline, etc.). Ultimately, I believe all of these to be true.   There's still time, still prayer. As for now, I'm not making the transition to Living Water. I don't believe that doing that will help change the rebellious attitude in my heart. It could very well strengthen it.  I will say, today was AMAZING. I've learned so much, cried so much (hehe), and shared so much joy with so many loved ones. I feel freedom, after prayer with Eddy. I feel like this performing, need-to-do-to-be-loved-by-God spirit is slowly chipping away. My desire is growing to connect with PEOPLE. And this is the change that God prompted me to pray about. Look at this twisted series of events that lead to this:  1. Strange prompting to pray twice in the middle of Sunday service, about change. 2. Ask Mark if we could meet about service at New Bridge. 3. We meet, Mark believes leaving New Bridge would be a good answer to my frustrations with New Bridge (possibly a wrong answer, but one that lead to:) 4. Me posting on here, and e-mailing everyone the post announcing my departure. 5. Faye replying with concern, me arguing such concerns. 6. Being talked to with Eddy and Chase.  God's complicated.  By the way, since this was such an awesome day, Melissa and I have deemed May 16th "National Zippadeedooda Day". I even printed out a sign and hung it on my door that said it.  Oh, and Eddy is continuing his support for me going to Master's Commission. He's verbally expressed his support, and today wrote out a check for $200 to contribute financially. Praise God! I'm also working to meet some MC requirements. I'm starting driver's ed at America's Best tomorrow (*PRAY FOR THE STREETS OF OLYMPIA*), and I'm taking my first GED test on Thursday. If any of you readers want to contribute to my "Master's Commission Fund", my donation website is  urlLink J4MC.com . If you know me personally, checks are much cooler, as the online thing takes a small percentage for credit card fees.   God bless!

      This is it. My last Sunday at New Bridge. While that's sad and blah dee blah blah, peoples is gettin' BAPTISED! Dunk, em, baby!  Some people have said that I've been bitter towards New Bridge, so I'm not really leaving 'gracefully'. I'm not bitter towards the Church at New Bridge (the people), I love them. Since the people are all that matter, I need not worry about the building. New Bridge, the worldly 'system' part, has ignored my gifts and my heart and whatnot. The people at New Bridge most certainly have not. I don't resent the people.  Anywho...  I'm starting driver's ed tomorrow. DUN DUN DUNNNNN. Just another step towards Master's Commission!!!

       >>Every time I've experienced consistent frustration over something, God's been trying to show me something He wants to change in my heart--not in the circumstances around me.>>   I actually didn't go to see Mark because I thought I needed to leave, Mark believed that was the case.  I see all of your points as extremely valid. I really hope that this move, in my heart, isn't for the reasons you stated (anger, unforgiveness, rebellion, pride). The way I'm looking at it, and the way I feel about it is this:  I'm not effective at New Bridge. New Bridge just doesn't offer the opportonity to use my gifts, and it gets very frustrating. I'm an active-type believer, I need need need to be doing something at my church. New Bridge doesn't offer what God's got for me to do. Mark was pretty clear on that. I've been lingering around New Bridge for over a year without a specific purpose. New Bridge has slowly become more and more unattractive to me, uncomfortable. And last Sunday, God impulsed me to pray during service about some kind of change... which is why I went to speak with Mark. I came to talk about serving, and he thought that my frustrations meant I shouldn't be at New Bridge.   John 15 ... I assume that you were partially referring to the verse that says  "A branch cannot produce fruit alone but must remain in the vine ". This is another New Bridgian misconception of my intentions. I've been called by God to do what I crave to do for Him. That sounds like the action being rooted in the Father, to me. Bring it back to  John 14:15 , where it says  "If you love me, you will OBEY my COMMANDS" . Or if you wanna stay in 15,  "I have obeyed my Father's commands, and I remain in his love. In the same way, if you obey my commands, you will remain in my love. I have told you these things so that you can have the same joy I have and so that your joy will be the fullest possible joy"   (John 15:10,11) .   Matthew 28:19,20  was spoken as a command that you should obey, " So go and make followers of all the people in the world. Baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey everything that I have taught you, and I will be with you always, even until the end of this age."  It says to go and make followers, not sit around and wait for followers to come to you (New Bridge). This is where my beliefs do not line up with New Bridge, and where my frustrations lie. They are Biblical, they just aren't what New Bridge is about.   As far as it goes with Mark's shpeal, I still disagree with him. I believe that ANYONE who has the heart and will of the FATHER to lead or serve should be able to. Black, white, mentally disabled, young, old, inexperienced... I'm never going to agree that you have to go through ranks. That's a worldly system. Experience should be judged by the heart, the attitude, and the spirituality of the individual person. It will be a goal of mine when I become a youth pastor to not allow one willing heart to go unnoticed as mine has been for so long.   So is there anger, unforgiveness, rebellion, and pride in all that? Possibly. I'm willing for the Father to hit me in the face if He'd like. All I know is I love Him and I want to fulfill His mission for me down here. I think that can be best accomplished elsewhere, I think Mark was right. But, I'm coming this Sunday and I have a whole week to wait on God, and see if His plans are different. I did listen to what you said, even if all of this seemed like I just argued it. I'll go now. LoL Write back!

      Yeah, I met with him today at 11:30. I know what I'm going to do now. This might be hard on some New Bridgians.  The past months have consisted of hardship, frustration, and overall confusion. Why am I at this church? What's my role? This isn't a Joey church... what am I doing, Lord, for you by going to a church I'm nothing but frustrated with? Why would you send me here for over a year to do absolutely nothing through me?  All of these thoughts, I believe, came from the Lord. While still it doesn't make that much sense to me, I know that I need to leave. I'm moving to the Church of Living Water. This upcoming Sunday will be my last at New Bridge.   Mark made the point that if you don't fully believe in and line up with the vision of the church you attend, then you're probably never going to quite fit. This disagreement was actually reaffirmed when Mark went on a little shpeal about New Bridge not recognizing people who have gifts, but people who "earn" their leadership positions by working for it. I thought, what is this, a business office or a place of worship?  He then prayed a blessing on me, and I was on my way.   I don't know why, I just know that it should be. God bless, more on this later. Jeff's here...

      Last night I went to youth group. It was nice, we had some good discussion and prayer and stuff. Chris, a guy I started talking to online, brought his girlfriend Chelsea. So it was different than the norm, and I liked it. I like growth. More people in our group, the better!  I talked breifly about it, and we prayed for it. I'm being prepared for something. These past weeks have been kinda different, and broke me. Now I'm on fire, and ready to serve the Lord. It's a nice feeling, one I haven't felt in awhile. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to bring more into His kingdom, and to share His love with people. The brokenness was necessary for this, and God is moving me in a direction I'm honestly unsure of.   I'm meeting with Pastor Mark and some of the leadership at New Bridge about it. I want to do this right, whatever it is. It could be the outreach later this fall, it could be something visually smaller. I just want to be at the right place with God.   Pray for me! I'm out.

      Alright ladies, here it is. Isn't it beautiful? And less scary, at that.  While some sacrifices were made (links are gone, customizations are gone, past comments are gone, doom guy is gone)... I believe they were well worth it. Just look how clean this page looks!   My life is going pretty smoothly. Allow me to take an excerpt from an e-mail I sent Pastor Tim about how I'm doing and show it to you!  ---------------------- Pastor Tim,  So, yeah! This is what's going on with me in reguards to Master's Commission.  My support letters didn't go so well. I expected more out of them I suppose, but I'm looking at it as a test from God. Are you willing to actually work for this, Joey? Or do you expect Me to hand it to you on a silver platter?  I'm going to be taking the GED. If not all of the tests, a chunk of them by June 4. I have a tutor for math, as it's my weakest subject. I have a goal to get 3200+ on them. Pray for me.  I'm also starting driver's ed either this month or the next. Woot woot!   At my church, there's a guy in the leadership team who's name is Eddy Willingham. He's been showing extra interest in me wanting to go to MC, and has breifly showed interest in wanting to be my house parent. He also, last Sunday, wanted to know my financial situation. I told him, and he told me to shoot him an e-mail. I pray this could be the answer to some of my prayers about this, but I'll just wait and see what God is doing.  And yeah, that's about it. I think the way things are going, I'll be going in 2005. That way, I'd be 18 and could do the house parent thing. My financial deal would probably be less stressful, as well. Anywho, I'll go now. Blessings! ----------------------  That's about the sum of things. Big Splash in on the 22nd. YAY! It's going to rock! Anywho, I'm out. Peaches and cream :)  P.S.

      My hosting service discovered I was doing file sharing, so until I upgrade from my free service, you'll enjoy the angelfire logo on my blog. This will probably last for two weeks.  Wow am I tired. I'm trying to go back on track in reguards to sleeping, and I think that's going nicely. Tommorrow I'm free, anyone that wants to hang out hit me up ya'll!  I just sounded like a retard. Woohoo.  Lets see, anything new... oh... my mom has this obsession with giving Jeff money now. Haha, she's paying him to tutor me in math- makes sense. Then she said, "Hey, and after that, I can pay him to take you on drives when you are doing driver's ed next month". Cool with me. He needs the money, and I need an adult to take me on drives because my parents are too old and lazy to do it themselves! Haha just kidding, they just wanna help out Jeff I think.   Well I'm going to go, considering I have nothing interesting to say. Peace out, fashiggities....

      I want to run out into this world, free and uncaring, screaming. I want this passion that wells up inside me to burst. Every inch of strength I am of ownership to, I want to push and stretch into the purposes of God. To never quit pursuing holiness, and to push to reach every lost and hurting child of God I can in this wretched world. I want to scream, to blow up and annihilate every lurking demon and every untrue doubt that is causing people to not see the Light. His love never ending, His grace always giving, His strength always at it's peak, His beauty always blinding. I want to scream of your glory, Father! I want every living thing to know how completely amazing you are! You've taken me, the essence of filth, and you've made me new! You've held me in times of hurt, you've given me energy me when I was tired, you've healed me! You are my passion, you are what is wanting to come out of me. You want to explode out of me rivers of your Holy Spirit! Lord, give me patience. I want to carry out your will for my life, in your timing. Let me not lose this passion while waiting, let it build and get stronger. I love you, Father God! I love you more than I thought I could ever love anything!

      Eli, 	I was going to e-mail you, but I don’t know if you ever read my e-mail.   	I can’t explain my way out of this, but I do want you to understand why I’ve done this. Now, I’m going to be straight up honest with you. I have been very frustrated if not annoyed with you. You’ve, lately, been that source of anger and frustration that’s derailed a chunk of my sanity. So what do I do about it? Stay frustrated on the inside, and  kill  someone when they do something small? Should I go to you about it, even though I know your reaction will probably not be productive but will likely be more damaging? No. I can’t. I need a way to let some of the frustration go, and blogging has been a way of doing this.  	That doesn’t take away from the fact that the stuff I said was unkind and offensive. This time, I’d agree with you about it. Let me put it this way:  	If you are angry about something, your first reaction is to be irrational. You spurt out things that you don’t mean, you insult, you push, you shove… But when you get over it, it’s no longer a problem and you no longer feel that way. If it’s not a problem anymore, you don’t talk about it, thus being why there aren‘t any “I‘m over it“ posts. There are probably several cases of frustration in my blog that I’ve discussed with Jeff or something and am now over. Those posts are in the past, just like the problems are.  	Now all I can say is, I’m sorry. I’m not saying I’m sorry for having been mad at you, but I’m sorry for the way I dealt with it. If you don’t forgive me, that’s fine. This is pretty much all I can do at this point.  	Once again, sowwie.           !*Joey

      Yes, folks... A month or two back I e-mailed Sevenball a question or two, and then today I got the new issue and I noticed my e-mail in the feedback section!!! I was in awe.. I've been a fan of this magazine forever! My comment is highlighted, and once you click the pic below make sure the whole thing loads. My thing starts at the bottom and continues to the top :-D    urlLink      Oh, their response was (because Sevenball is ran by a different company now) "We had no idea they did that" and reguarding the street team "We're planning on that in the future". Go to sevenballstore.com to subscribe. This magazine rocks!!  Lots has been happening. Unfortunately I'm too lazy to type that up right now. Check out this excerpt of a Dilbert comic! It had me cracking up for a LONG time!

      1.  Q:	 List the classes or subjects in which you plan to enroll.  A:	I will be working towards my Associate of General Studies. 2.  Q:	 Describe your educational preparation that qualifies you for these classes.  A:	My educational preparation consisted of various workbooks and materials that my mother, Carol Cristina, organized herself. As my home school teacher, she believes that I am ready to move on in my education and my life. I took and passed the GED test in full on Wednesday, June 16. 3.   Q:	Explain why you believe attendance at South Puget Sound Community College is preferable to attending the public school system.  A:	I was home schooled. I’m interested in advancing my education, and I plan to transfer to a 4 year school (Northwest College) to pursue a career and purpose in Youth Ministry. I feel that classes at SPSCC will serve my needs.  Hokey, eh?

      I've been taking "the tests" at the college. I'm doing really well on them.. passing the tests isn't what I'm worried about.. nor even getting an honorable mention. I need 600/800 on my math test to be eligable for a scholarship. I need a scholarship! I'll be taking the last test this Wednesday. WOOT! I'll post the scores of the math test once I get the results.. Right now I only know of Science (540), Writing (630), Reading (690) and Social Studies (660). That gives me an average of 630, and I need an average of 640 to be eligable for the scholarship.  I have an SPSCC student number now. YAY! I turned in an application for admission, and I have an appointment with a counselor on the 18th. I have it all planned out.  I get my 2 year  urlLink Associate of General Studies  transfer degree at  urlLink SPSCC , and then I continue on to  urlLink Northwest University  to get my  urlLink BA in Youth Ministry . There may end up being a few glitches and twists in the plan, but that's about as specific as it can be for me at this point.  I am a monkey. Rawrrr

      Studying and searching, for a long while I've been curious about the concept of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. This is how I'd describe what some believe about it:  An experience received by asking, distinct from and follows the new birth, in which brings endowment of power for Christian living and service.  For so long I didn't understand it. If the indwelling of the Holy Spirit begins at salvation, what would the purpose of a "Baptism of the Holy Spirit" be? Is this concept even Biblical?  Let's find out. [Okay- I had some commentary after each verse. Unfortunately, I read them over far after I posted them- and some of them were VERY stupid! I have omitted them and leave you with just the verses, so that you can make your own decision]   Ephesians 1:13  -  In whom ye also [trusted], after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise    John 16:7  -  Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you     Luke 11:13  -  If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?    You already have the Spirit in your heart- you've been SEALED with that Holy Spirit of Promise (John 16:7), but the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is like asking Him to be MORE apparent, MORE active- and saying I AM WILLING TO PUT MY SIN ON THE LINE FOR YOUR GUIDANCE!   The reason I'm saying these things is because I received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit on July 10, 2004. My experience was a physical one- one where I literally felt the glory of the hand of God's Holy Spirit press upon and in and out of me like I never have felt before. But seek Him, seek His Word, His voice- don't take my word for it. Take His.  G'night!

      Leftcoastkid04: joey your Blog post wasn't depressing Leftcoastkid04: lol RAdialAngel7: yes it was lol Leftcoastkid04: not so much RAdialAngel7: showed the Christian youth community to be unauthentic to God, Eric's not a believer anymore, said I'm no longer going to New Bridge, and that Harlee has a kidney infection RAdialAngel7: that's depressing. ALL OF IT was depressing Leftcoastkid04: well if you look at it THAT way then yes it was depressing Leftcoastkid04: but i prefer to look at it a different way, thank you RAdialAngel7: LoL shine positive light on all of those things for me Leftcoastkid04: okay Leftcoastkid04: the Christian youth thing:  it shows that a lot of Christian youth in the same boat when it comes to staying authentic to their Christianity so we all need to lean on one another and support each other, which creates binding friendships.  also its just an example of how much God loves us.  even if its hard to stay authentic to our Christianity as youth, its a good example of how God still loves his children even when they sin.  Leftcoastkid04: Eric not being a believer:  technically, if someone has accepted Christ into their heart they're a believer forever.  Eric has just fallen away and now is a good time to bring him back.  if he turns back to God after turning away thats what makes really strong Christians.  if other believers can help Eric, then he'll end up being stronger in the Lord than ever Leftcoastkid04: you not going to Newbridge anymore is good for you.  and like i've told you many, many times we all love you joey, so what's good for you is good for us.  just because we wont see you in church on sunday anymore 1. doesn't mean we'll never see you (at least it better not! )  and 2. doesn't mean that we won't care about you anymore.  if it's good for you and your relationship with God to move on, then I WANT YOU TO! Leftcoastkid04: and Harlee having a kidney infection... well i can't come up with a good spin on that, but i think 3 out of 4 is purdy good RAdialAngel7: Depression wins! RAdialAngel7:  RAdialAngel7: Good job, Tori Leftcoastkid04: hey! Leftcoastkid04: lol Leftcoastkid04: thanks RAdialAngel7: Mind if I share your perspective with the class? Leftcoastkid04: nope Leftcoastkid04: i don't mind atall RAdialAngel7: yay RAdialAngel7: It will be a "A not depressing post... kind of" Leftcoastkid04: lol.  see i told you i could do it!  granted... there's really no way you can put a positive spin on a kidney infection Leftcoastkid04: lol Leftcoastkid04: lol Leftcoastkid04: yay!

      Alright, guys. I know I haven't posted in here in awhile. BUT- How the Lord has been touching me lately! A few new sacrifices have been made, and I'm praying and praying HARD for a closer, deeper relationship with Jesus.   I wanted to share this story with you, which is kind of depressing.. In an impact-your-heart sort of way.    Mocked For Her Standards   An Excerpt From "Every Young Man's Battle"        A few years back, Cyndi was known throughout her church as a girl who lived purely and radically for God, a high-school student with high standards. I'll never forget a conversation I [Fred Stoeker] had with her. "Is it hard to hold such high standards like you do?" I asked.       "Oh, I don't mind being mocked," she replied. "Christ was mocked plenty. That's just part of it."        Wow , I said to myself. We sat silently for a while as I pondered her statement. Then I glanced up at her and found her staring wistfully into the distance. Suddenly, her face crumpled slightly, and a large tear rolled out of the corner of her eye.       "I so ache to find a friend, anyone, who's like me," she whispered.        How can this be?  I thought.  How can we all be so mushy in our standards that those walking straight are lonely?        I asked her youth pastor, Larry, "Why aren't the other youth drawn to Cyndi? I would be."       "Oh, they respect her to no end," said Larry. "Of course, some will always mock, but her peers rarely choose radically committed Christians as role models. That represents too much sacrifice and too much risk of not being accepted. They prefer to hang out with guys who play sports and have a lot of girlfriends.  You know, one who's both Christian and worldly simultaneously."       ...While authenticity has its price, inauthenticity for the sake of acceptance has a high price as well... The effects of your sin will follow you into adulthood. Since both have their price, why not pay the price for something great? Why not fight?  God  will  reward you.   Pray for Harlee- she has a kidney infection. Interceed for Eric Miller... he used to know Jesus and was my influence to accept Jesus into my life... but his faith is fallen and he doesn't believe any more.  I'm making a church transition (yes.. it's true) and I'm seeking prayer for that. I'm looking into church histories behind Assemblies of God and Foursquare. This is an interesting thing, because you may have heard me in the past talk about how I'm anti-denominational because I believe denominations divide the Body of Christ. This is why I am seeking God's guidance. Pray pray pray, brothers and sisters!  G'night.
