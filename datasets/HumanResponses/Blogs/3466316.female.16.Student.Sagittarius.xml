      so i don't think anyone will be reading this...but i guess i've finally jumped on the blogging band wagon haha, i don't have much of...well let's be honest....anything to say. so whether you know me or not, prepare to be bored out of your mind...and maybe even slightly annoyed?  cuz i'm thinking this blog will be a good outlet for bitching. and a whole lot of it.  so. to get the ball rolling, now is possibly the worst time for me to start a blog but procrastination will do a lot for a person--oh and by the way, this week has been like purgatory. definitely the hardest, longest, worst week of my academic career. But luckily it will all be over soon! (no i'm not suicidal, don't worry.) summer is in 8 days...wooo!!!!!!

      yeah so kate and i spent about...5.5 hours shopping at rosedale today, probably the longest mall trip i've had since the good ole 'get dressed up in your best charolette russe outfit and glitter eye make up' days. it. was. awesome. why is spending money and then getting cute stuff so satisfying? sure, it's a bit materialistic...but dammit. if it feels good, do it...right? right? ha yeah, so now i'm just bummin around and i don't want to go to sleep...so i guess i'll keep rambling...today i woke up at like 1:30, also, awesome. then the day went by super fast and before i knew it i was at cup and cone with hannah, kate, emo, and about 5,000 WB kids who all seemed to know eachother.  then cassidy and robbie showed up and we exchanged 'small talk' if you will and then, well, left cup and cone and ventured to emo's cubicle (which, by the way, is spectacular).  after this i finally got a hold of syngen (we played 'phone tag' all day...wow that's really mom-ish of me...) but then he had to go haha, we'll prolly talk later but for now, i'm chillin with john stewart and the daily show: hilarious.

      today...i did nothing...ha...well, i did get yelled at by my temporary-cripple of a mother for probably about 6 hours total...oh yeah, and i mowed the lawn! always a good time to be had there...the best part of the day was that i got the chance to take a realllly long car ride.  it was awesome.  time to clear my head i guess? blasted alanis morrissette and sang at the top of my lungs haha, i'm so cool :)  well i don't have much else to say except that...yup. no that's all ha

      so. after a ravishing week of yearbook-ing, followed by 4 colleges in 2 days and a 72 hour boo-hoo fest with simone, hannah, and kate (oh and chris for a while)...i have come to the conclusion that men are swine. now, this isn't to offend any of my male readers (ha...like i have readers...) but let's be honest: men are lowly little creatures aren't they?  furthermore, after viewing such films as "the notebook" and "a walk to remember", one might assume that the RIGHT man, or the nice man, or the sweet man, is out there...but the media, as always...is misleading all us women into believing one big elaborate lie. boys are quite frankly, not very nice.  and as kate's mom puts it "they never change" and as my mom puts it "it doesn't get any better" they (or at least most the ones i've met) care about no one but themselves and are ultimately thinking solely with their dicks.  okay guys, if anyone is, or knows of a boy who is nice, funny, caring, sweet, and i'd add cute, but that's pushing it...let me know. hell. let all of us MPA sophomore girls know so at least we have a level playing field.  good god i am sick of this already.  boys, think about your actions and how they effect others, yeah? oh and please, PLEASE, don't lie. and don't trick...and don't fake it. AH...JUST BE NICE  p.s. yup, that's pretty a bitchy entry...it's my blog, deal with it.

      while summer is an extremely fun, relaxing and all around wonderful time of the year...it does pose to major problems.  1) a severe lack of money and 2) all that stuff i had no time to think about during the school year suddenly seems like the biggest deal in the world.  case and point: keeping my bedroom clean.  oh yeah, and is it just me or is summer when you truly find out what kind of a friend a person is? given, this can probably happen anytime of the year but let's be honest...with like 981023283 hours of homework a night...who maintains the mental capacity to think about the true meaning of friendship? and by the way, what is this away message crap? half the time, people are just sitting around staring at their computer screen waiting for that little aol icon to bounce up and down so the intense boredom will be temporarily relieved. whatever...anyways...you, yes you, let's hang out. call me.

      ah! i am trying sooo hard to be happy about summer.  god it's so frustrating! i would have killed for it like 3 days ago, but all of a sudden i feel, i dunno, weighted down? yeah. i feel weighted down.  guilty almost.  because here i am all excited for summer, trying to ignore that fact that some of my closest friends are leaving MPA and then all these fears of drifting apart and losing touch come into view and i just feel like shit.  So on top of everyone people leaving, let's be honest: there are people who i just wont' hang out with/talk to this summer.  and it's no fault of their's, maybe it's even a fault of my own...but anyways that sucks.  cuz i really want to keep in touch with everyone i've gotten to know this year.  i'm going to miss all the people who make me smile.  oh wow.  i just read all the stuff people wrote in my yearbook (p.s. i didnt' have time/couldn't find a bunch of people i wanted to sign my yearbook..boooo ) ahhh i wish that there was something that was like school--but not--to bring us all together you know? like school minus all this "learning" nonsense.  basically. i want school lunch. except, school lunch with chipotle.  that would be awesome, and totally plausable too, right? okay. well i'm done with this depressing entry...go be happy about summer guys!

      in 6 and a half minutes i will be: 1. a junior 2.  out of the math room 3.  looking at BLUE carpet instead of puke green carpet 4.  screaming 5.  jumping for joy/running somewhere 6.  overwhelmed with relief (tears maybe?) 7.  acting obnoxious 8.  starting my summer 9.  worrying about things like, what i'm going to eat for lunch? instead of am i going to have time to eat lunch? 10.  FREAKING OUT  (p.s. just took my math final....last one, 6 min--okay, 5 and a half minutes and counting until i'm done with school)

(not that i have anything againts burger king employees....just not my prime choice of a career) okay, i'm rambling...but i suppose it IS my blog and that's what they're for..but alright. i'm done. back to studying. no sleep till imperialism!

      i do not give a fuck about you. i do not give a fuck what you have to say about me, my life, or my blog. in my opinion, you, and i have a pretty good idea who you are, are a lowly, bottom feeding, lying little bitch who has no life or friends to claim as his/her own. you are pathetic. you haven't the slightest clue about me or my life and yet you choose to try to belittle me on my BLOG. if you have a problem with me, i dare you to say it to my face. or hell, call me. 612 221 8910.

      do you ever wonder just what EXACTLY is going through people's minds when they do, well, what they do? cuz lately i've been trying to figure that out. (by the way, i'm not talking about a large number of people...just a handful that i can't seem to comprehend).  now, call me crazy, but i don't like this whole "do as i say, not as i do" stigma.  as a matter of fact, it pisses me off. people think that just because they say it, that makes it true, make it un-do what's already been done. in general i would have to say that i value only 2 core enteties,if you will, in any given relationship.  i like to think i can put up with a lot of shit but these 2 things really stand out to me.  trust and loyalty. that's all i ask of in a relationship, friendship, whatever. that's IT. 2 little tiny things and whodathunk they'd turn out to be so hard to find?

      hello all, it's been a while...but yeah nothing terribly exciting has happened in the last few days. except card-ing with btang and lil biz (which is AWESOME), the fact the i got grounded yesterday and bikram (aka 'big-room-maria's-an-idiot') yoga. and let me tell you, bikram yoga is the best thing since sliced bread...yeah, that's right, bread.  for those of you not in the know, bikram yoga is this reallllly intense version of yoga, power yoga if you will.  so it's power yoga in a 103 degree room. yeah? awesome. it feels soooooo good to sweat like a mad woman. sure, sounds gross, but trust me it's very cleansing and it makes you feel so incredibly energized. so, it was actually on my way to this wonderful sshhweaty class that i made my first mistake in a series of mistakes yesterday (friday).  i,  maria mikel, drove. not one. but TWO people in my car. and after the "i can't find my car" fiasco of thursday i was only supposed to drive one person. so, while i should have played dumb with my madre and said "oops, my bad i drove 2 people"...i lied and said i only drove one. yeah. she totally knew. she always knows when i pull stuff like that (which by the way i rarely do cuz my mom is pretty trusting and i have no reason to lie and...cuz i'm the 2004 equivalent of the virgin mary). so yeah, i confessed and then proceeded to throw a bit of a hissy fit...long story short, a few "you're such a bitch!"and  "well i learned it from you!"'s later, i was grounded for the whole goddamned weekend.  boo. i drove 2 people to a yoga class that was 5 minutes there and back. lamest reason to get grounded ever.

      man. lame night. so i went to dinner with btang and stizphiz, which was not lame, and then we wanted to do something else. but we couldnt' think of anything, so we went to sunray to go bowling. and bowling was 23 freaking dollars for an hour so we were like...fuck that. and went to TJ maxx and, well, didn't buy anything ha, and then called tom and met up with him in the parking lot outside caribou and even though he promised to think of something for us to do, he couldn't think of anythign either, so we finally decided on a movie when our parents (ahem steph and becca's) got difficult and that was a no go. so we all went our seperate ways. needless to say we spent most of the night just sitting in a car/in a parkinglot on the curb talking and laughing at stupid stuff...so here i am, blogging on a friday night. bummer, huh? oh well, it was nice to see steph before she left for texas and tomorrow i'll be going to visit kate, which should be...uh...as fun as possible under the circumstances. so yeah, uneventful friday but what can you do? i guess i've got plenty left before i have to worry about wasting them.    p.s. i'd appreciate it if you (the readers...ha, all 4 of you) could keep the snide comments to a minimum. it's kind of, well, at the risk of sounding repetitive, lame.

      okay. i would like to take this oppurtunity to give a much needed, and yes extremely cheesy thank you to all my friends (you know who you are)...i would just like to say that i am the luckiest girl in the world, for many reasons, but especially to have you guys around to help me laugh through it all. you guys are always there for me and i can't thank you enough for letting me bitch about the stuff that really doesn't matter, but damn, it feels like it matters. and for making me smile when i thought it an impossibility, for consoling me after many an encounter with my crazy-mother, for always always always keeping your cell phones turned on and trying (ahem becca) to answer them, for cup n cone, for the lake, for boat whoring, for the gangsta nation, for all the dances, for all the food, for not counting unless you see nipple, for everything. i love you all, i couldn't ask for a better group of friends.

      today was muy beuno (yeah. i don't speak spanish...but...it seemed fitting.) after a sleepover with kate, we ventured (at 11 am...freaking early if you ask me!) to move a bunch of heavvvvy tables, and then to wb beach for like 4 hours and got a bit bored and then went out on tom's boat and to dinner with yale, steph, becca, and kate! good stuff! oh yeah! AND while tubing, stizphiz and i were thrown into a festering pit of seaweed (well, lake..weed ha), we have yale to thank for that...but it's all good, it was fun...until i felt like i was drowning in medusa's snake-pit hair haha...  alright well this is completely off topic, but how much do you love it when you hear a song for the first time and it feels like one of those songs that you've just been listening to for forever. and it never gets old cuz it's just like those songs your mom played it for you when you were like 4, and everything about the song fits and the melody is just perfect and the lyrics relate to you so much it's almost scary? yeah. i LOVE THAT...it's happened a lot lately and it's just the best feeling. i love music.  i'm sorry but i just don't understand how some people can not listen to music and be normal! music is possibly the best release i can think of, well unless your angry...in which case, smashing rocks (and by smash i mean full on boulder thrown as hard as possible onto another hard surface, preferably a rock) is definitely the best way to go...listening to music and smashing rocks, totally healthy ways of dealing with excess emotion.  wow guys, that was an odd entry. sorry, i just reread it and it makes about zero sense...but it took a whole 5 minutes to write and i am therefore unwilling to delete it. :)

      read the gossip girl series! it is so vapid, shallow and deliciously entertaining it's not even funny. also, eat as much ice cream as humanly possible. swing (yup, find a park and go swinging). scream into a pillow, or out a window, or just at someone. and then go to cup and cone and eat more ice cream...woo! deep thoughts, hope you guys can handle all that ha :)

      my mind is really cluttered right now, so this entry will most likely follow suit.  i just saw fahrenheit 9/11, which was great. i laughed, i cried, i wanted to drop kick the president. it was beautiful.  also, i would just like to say that i am so goddamn selfish it's almost scary.  as i'm walking out to my mommy-bought car after fahrenheit 9/11 a number of thoughts run through my mind...i hate george bush, i want that girl's jeans, i should protest, or rally for kerry, i wonder if that purse went on sale at gap yet, yeah, i'll rally, i want that girl's boyfriend, oh! i'll make signs! maybe there'll be cute boys at the rally...i suck. i mean, really, i do. and i know it.  at least i know it right? ah! i feel like shit about myself. i want to help people. and i want to give back but at the same time, i like gap okay? i do. i love shopping, and i love civil rights...is that so wrong?

      well my 4th was pretty damn awesome i must say.  becca, kate and i (hannah was there in spirit) were the only ones left in town/not with family so we got together and hit up the wb beach, the taste of minnesota, and wb fireworks. so wb beach was the same as always...lack there of in the hot guy department this time, but jack was there, so it was all g. yeah. the taste of minnesota was possibly the dirtiest, most disgusting, horrifying experience ever. i mean it was worse than the state fair on a 104 degree day last summer (ahem, kate and hannah).  yeah, i'm just thankful we got out when we did. i think we stayed for all of 10 minutes before we decided it was time to go and find a restaurant.  call us high maintenance if you will, but seriously. fhimas was a much better fit for us. so fhimas was great, as always, and then we headed back to wb for fireworks...good times, fireworks make me sooooo happy it's not even funny...i'm thinking about finding some more to go watch tonight...if i can find some...

      ah!! i have had the BEST past few days. it's not even funny. well actually, it was mostly funny...mostly hilarious.  big ups (haha) to stizphiz, btang, lil biz, potpie, kiz, and btang for 3 days well spent!  you know those moments every once and a whle when you just think to yourself "god dammit. this is so awesome. this is awesome. life is so incredibly awesome. this is what it's all about." yeah i feel like i just had about a million of those jam packed into 3 days. yeah. sweet, i know.  so you must be wondering by now...if you're still reading that is..."maria, what DID you do that was so awesome?" well. i'll tell you to the best of my recollection...  after the "shop till you drop" entry, steph and i decided that it would be a GENIUS idea to suprised becca on her birthday/before her driver's test (which she passed!!!!). just one little detail, her test was at 8 20am so in order to make an adequate card and pick up caribou we would have to get there at 7 30.  now one would assume that this would leave enough time but OH NO, the eyerly's leave insanely early for EVERYTHING and so we flagged becca and her mom down on the way to/from her house. i think she was pretty surpised.  then steph and i went back to her house and fell asleep with johnny depp.  but THEN the lawn boys came.  alright, anyone who knows steph has probably heard about her lawn boys. and okay, she says they're hot. but let me tell you, they are BEAUTIFUL. STRIKING. GORGEOUS.  so we stared at them for a while, then went outside and had fun with side walk chalk (needless to say, the lawn boys weren't impressed) then btang DROVE ALL BY HERSELF to steph's and we washed our cars (which we discovered are christmas colors...we have big plans.) after the best waterfight in history, i had to leave and help out at a garage sale (AGAIN) but then i left...and picked up kate and we decided to go to lake phalen.  BUT on the way, we saw paul driving the opposite direction, so we called him, found him, and he invited us (emo, kate, me, simone, hannah) to his house to go swimming/have pizza/watch jurassic park 2...yeah, AWESOME.  then i drove hannah, kate and i to hannah's (at around 30 mph the entire way cuz of all the dayum deer).  and we did the usual. ate, talked, ate, voodoo-ed, ate, slept...the next morning, kate and and i headed to simone's (hannah had a painting class) and met up with becca and steph.  after tanning with jack (PANAMA jack), swimming, and of course eating, we decided to bike to whitebear beach for a quick dip at the public beach (ahem...looking for hot boys).  then somehow, not sure how, we ended up at becca's house and then on tom's boat! which was sooooo much fun it's crazy! after another swim, this time in freezing bald eagle lake, and after docking the boat (what a feat.) we went to tom's for a second where a few of us borrowed shirts (haha and smelled like boy for a bit).  then to cup and cone, where i unfortunately had to depart (without even ice cream!) cuz i had to be home in 10 minutes and i like at least 25 minutes away.    wow. that is supppper long and i'm sure i left out a bunch of stuff, but if you read all that, a) i apologize for boring you, and b) shame on you, you should be out and about enjoying summer! yeah, so that entry is basically a proclaimation of mine just to state the complete and total fabulous-ness that is summer vacation!

      the last couple days have been ever so delightful, i'm working again! woo! making money is so addicting. so is spending it, ha, especially when it's not mine, but slightly more satisfying when it is...so yeah after work i've been just kinda bummin around with simone, kate, becca and hannah (when she gets off work). it's a good time! yesterday we hung out, then went to some, ahem, classy...stores at the mall and prepared for a wonderful evening of sluttin it up at the club...and on the way to simone's we got a call from cassidy, so we stopped by his house for a bonfire (which was loverly) and then hannah and i spent the night at kate's. today tom was so kind to take us out on his boat for a little while at least. yeah, it was FREEZING but worth it. so then simone, becca, kate and hung out at becca's for a while and ended the evening with some hardcore fireworks (ha, firecrackers...) so yeah, here i am...work tomorrow but i dont' feel like going to sleep quite yet. oh well, i'm out...by the way, i need to find an SAT prep course...does anyone have a recommendation?

      that it's a proven fact that males are nearly 8 hours behind females when it comes to processing emotion (thank you mr. meacock) my vote, at least 24. sorry boys, but lets be honest...you're the ones who feel the need to ask "are you okay?" while a girl is sitting there with tears streaming down her face...and also, what's up with covering your face with your hat/pulling up your shirt and sniffling underneath it. do you think we can't see you? we all know you're sobbing under there. and while i'm talking about boys...where are you?! seriously! this whole 'no cute boy' bit is getting quite old. so how about all you cute, loving, nice boys crawl out from underneath whatever rock you're hiding under and come out and play. i can think of about 12 girls off the top of my head who would be happy to entertain your company.  yeah, wow i can't believe i just made a cry for boys in my blog...like anyone reads this ha...anyways...where are all the good men in this world?!

      today was so-so....i woke up late (like some time after 12) and then had to immediately begin the wonderful process that is house cleaning. i WAS going to mow the lawn...i had gotten all mentally prepared and everything, i despise mowing the lawn....but it would not start, my mother of course did not believe me and thus an argument insued. long story short i ended up cleaning the kitchen, the living room and my bathroom...which took a while, and sucked, a lot. but at least it wasn't very nice out. i got a...lovely? visit from pretty much my entire family to, no doubt, eat dinner and what visit from my family would be complete without a few racist comments and me storming up the stairs to my room? well, the family left, and then syngen and i headed to the village. we took a slight detour to venture the unknown (aka the new parking lot at school...so cool) and then, i got scared and he didn't and i felt a little dumb...but yeah now i'm at home and i know the second i try to go to sleep i'll start thinking about all the scariest parts in the movie...and then prolly all the scariest parts in other movies, ha, does that happen to anyone else?...i think it's just me.
