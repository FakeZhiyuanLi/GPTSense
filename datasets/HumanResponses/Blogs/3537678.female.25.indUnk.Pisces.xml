       I have been avoiding the pregnancy test for a few weeks.  I knew that there was a good possibility that I was pregnant, but too scared to buy a pregnancy test.  Perhaps I was just scared of how life-changing it could be.  My sister kept bugging me to just buy one, though, so I finally got brave and did.  The results- positive.  So, I told Jason, and his reaction wasn't what I expected at all.  In fact, he wasn't excited really at all, which really hurt.  But I just chalked it up to shock.    I know that pregnancy tests aren't always right, so the next morning I took another test.  The results- positive.  We decided to wait to tell our families and friends until this next weekend when we go home, so I really had no one to talk to about it.  And to make it even harder, Jason came out and told me that he wasn't excited at all.  He didn't feel ready, and he is very worried about everything.  It hurt a lot.  Feel like I am kind of in this on my own.  So, in an hour, I will go to the doctor and find out for sure if I am or not.  I am nervous about going- I think because if I find out I am not I am going to be very disappointed.  I want to be a mom.  I am excited for this baby.  Yeah, I am worried about being a good mom, aboud providing for my child, and for even the possibility of messing them up, but I am ready.  I am just so thankful to God for this blessing.  And I know that God is in control and will be with us and provide for us.  So God, I look to you.

       I know that a lot has been said about President Reagan in the past week since he passed, and I couldn't even begin to compare with what has been said.  But what I will say is that Reagan was a good man, a great president, and someone that people could look up to.  The world was a better place because he lived, and we will miss him.  With President Reagan passing this week, it has brought up a lot of feelings about my own grandfather who passed away in December.  He suffered from Alzheimers also, and for those of us who are unfortunate enough to have a loved one go through this, we all feel for the family of President Reagan.  Watching my grandfather slip away from us was the hardest thing that I have ever had to endure.  I would go to visit him, and he had no clue who I was.  But as I looked deep into his eyes, I saw glimpses of my grandfather.    I prayed every night for a year that Grandpa would make it to my wedding.  And when it came time for the wedding, I had to make the hardest decision of all- not to have my grandpa there.  It was best for him- he would have become aggravated as the day went on being surrounded by so many people he didn't know and in a setting he wasn't familiar with.  But that didn't mean that I didn't miss him there either.  After the wedding, Jason and I took wedding pictures to him so he could see the events of the day.  And he kept asking me who people were in the pictures.  He would also talk to me about his granddaughter, Cody, who was so happy.  And I would talk back about myself in the third person.    He was always trying to create an escape plan out of the Alzheimers unit that he was in.  The doors were locked for the safety of the patients, and this drove the farmer in my grandfather crazy.  So, when we would come visit, he would have a plan of escape and try to get us to go along with it.  He was always looking out for us, telling us that he would distract everyone so we could escape.  But the hard thing about these sometimes funny discussions was the fact that we couldn't protect and save him like he was willing to do for us.  We had no choice but to leave him there.  And when it was time to go, he would chase you down the hallway, and when the locked door closed behind you, he would bang on the door.  One day he banged on the door for minutes, screaming at me, cussing at me.  And all I could do was cry and cry and cry.  There are a lot of bad memories of the last years with my grandfather, but I will never forget the man he was before the disease!  And I was so thankful to God that his suffering is over! God be with those whose family members have or have had Alzheimers, and be with those who suffer from it!

       I was trying to be careful on Sunday in the 95 degree heat.  I actually put on sunscreen (something my mother has yelled at me for not doing ever since I was born).  I did, however, have to wear my shorts and a tank-top to weed, that way I would work on my summer tan.  When did having a tan body become so important?  Don't we realize the dangers of skin cancer, especially after seeing so many diagnosed with it?  Anyway, the sunscreen did protect me on the areas that I placed it.  I didn't take account for my shirt riding up when I bent over to pluck the weeds out of the soil.  For over an hour, the skin on my lower back was exposed, and I have been paying the price for it ever since.  I have never had a sunburn that hurt so badly.  I can't sleep, can't sit, can't walk without it hurting me some how.  I guess it teaches me a good lesson though.  And as much as it pains me to say it, I will go ahead and face the truth:  Mom was right!

       Friday night I took my youth group camping.  We had a great time, running around without a care in the world, playing hide-and-go-seek in the tall trees by the shadow of the moon in to the wee hours.  When do we lose that child-like attitude?  Where does it go?  A lot of times, I notice that my teens are afraid to have fun for fear of looking silly.  Why?  Who cares if you have a little fun and regress back to your childhood days?  Who is really watching and caring about your every move?  One of my boys made this clear to me as we were running away from our seekers.  He says to me, "Cody, even though you are older, you still have some of the child left in you."  I wonder how often the kids only see the adult side of me.  What is so wrong with showing the kid side?  What is so wrong for me to be an adult and still act like a kid?  There is so much that we lose by hiding that side of us!  I wish more adults would break out and act like kids once in a while!  Was exhausted Saturday due to less that two hours of sleep!  But being an adult, you have to get things done, so I worked on my list.  One of those things on the list brought me and Jason up to the church.  And as we are getting out of the car, I hear my co-worker, Vicki, yell to come here.  I get out of the car and walk quickly to the side of the building.  And there is a wobbly hours old baby antelope.  So cute!  It didn't even have the fear of humans in him yet.  He just sat there and bawled at us, and even tried to follow us.  But being brought up around wild animals, you know not to touch them, that the mom has stashed them away and will come back for them.  So cute- hard to leave alone, but sure enough Sunday morning, the baby antelope was gone.  Sunday at church was fun because mid-way through service I feel this hand grab my foot.  I look down and there is 8 month-old Ryan crawling under our chairs.  He sat and played in front of us, having a great time chewing on our pen and water bottle!  I can't wait to have kids of my own and to share these experiences with them!

       Driving in to work this morning, I was feeling tired and sore from playing a couple of softball games last night.  My eyes were on myself, my hurt leg, my tired eyes.  And then God gave me a little perspective.  I was speeding along the road, trying to not be late to work, when a family of geese began to cross the road.  I slowed down and watched God's creation in awe.  The parent geese standing in the middle of the road while 9 baby geese crossed.  They had to wait a while too, because although most of the geese realized the severity of the situation of on-coming traffic and tried to cross quickly, there was one who couldn't figure out how to get off the curb.  They patiently waited, and he soon found a way, and off and waddling he went.    It is moments like these that I remember who I am- a creation of God.  But not just any creation- God created me to please him.  He loves me and will take care of me, even more than he cares for the geese.  In moments like these I realize that the world doesn't revolve around Cody, that their is a greater purpose for me being here.  And those geese were put there at that moment to help me remember my Heavely Father.  What a great way God teaches me and points me back to him!

       The church that I work at sits right on the outskirts of Gillette.  Now, for those of you who dont' know, Gillette sits on the North-eastern part of Wyoming.  About 25,000 people live here, which is pretty good size for Wyoming.  And we have another claim to fame- we are called The Energy Capital of The World because most of the nation's energy comes from Gillette.  Other than that, it is dry and flat.  But when you grow up next to the Rocky Mountains, everything seems flat to you.  Actually, I have come to enjoy this flat land- you can see for miles and miles which can actually be quite beautiful.    Anyway, back to the church that I work at.  Because it sits on the outskirts of the town, we have a lot of antelope that frequent the church.  They sit next to the glass, eat all our plants and grass.  They really are quite beautiful animals.  Their huge black eyes looking at you, their peaceful nature.  I could sit in my office and watch them for hours.  Makes me wish that my life could be that peaceful, that the only worry I had was where I would eat, or if some human was getting too close to me.  Life would be a lot simpler, that is for sure.

       Well, here I am trying an online journal.  That is what my blogger will be- my personal thoughts, my dreams, my feelings- life through Cody's eyes.  I suppose I should introduce myself for those who might venture onto this sight.  My name is Cody.  I am a 25 Christian female originally from Lyons, Colorado (near Boulder).  Two years ago I got married to a great man named Jason, who is from a ranch in Eastern Colorado.  Last year I graduated from Chadron State Collge (in Chdaron, Nebraska) with my Bachelor's of Science in Education with an endorsement in Physical Education and Health K-12.  So, you probably think that I became a teacher.  Not exactly.  God had other plans for me, and for almost a year now I have been a youth and young adult minister in Gillette, Wyoming.    I have had many great and interesting experiences that have shaped me to be the person I am today.  From playing volleyball in college, to growing up with great Christian parents, I have many fun tails that I might share through this journal.  But until then.....here's my Wilder journey.
