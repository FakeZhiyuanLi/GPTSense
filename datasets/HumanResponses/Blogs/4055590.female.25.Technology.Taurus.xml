       I feel I am a RockStar because I love humanity. I rejoice in humanities triumphs as well as weep in it's tribulations. What makes you a Rockstar?

       Who has seen it? What is your rating 1 - 10 stars, 10 being best?    We went and saw IRobt starring Will Smith last night. Great movie! It has everything, action, comedy, Sci-Fi & awesome script,  it would have been hard to mess it up. If you have seen it holla back! I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

      Okay everyone it has been a long time since I have had a drunken story ... Well with the exception of the "Taxi Cab Confession's" story I had Pride weekend a few weeks back. Some of you know that one, others, well, good thing there wasn't a video camera in the cab because ... My potential political career would be ruined (wink wink) . Anyways went to a local bar thurday night. My intention was to go their get 2 beers then go meet a friend. That planned was quickly ruined by 4 chicks whom kept buying my shots of some brown drink, it wasn't Yeager but it tasted just as bad. Now I should have known it was a set up because they weren't really drinking, kept giving me their drinks. Long story short I almost got taken advantage of by 4 chick so I had to brake out of their and go home. The weridest things we do when we are drunk. I stumbled in the door and began to clean my house in the wee hours of the morning. I was vacuuming and sweeping and throwing out trash till I passed out in the middle of my living room with a dust rag in my hand. Hmmm well maybe not as interesting pf a drunken story as I use to have. No fights, sex, running people over ...etc. I GUESS I AM REALLY GETTING OLD HUH?

       I am having a absolutely horrible day!&nbsp;My health isn't good nor is&nbsp;my &nbsp;... Everyday life issues. This crucial moment in my life, I am trying to balance way to much. As well as, I feel if I am drowning within my&nbsp;life. I will try to put on a happy face, and try to go through the motions. If unsuccessful, please don't ask me what is wrong or tell me that its going to be ok. I am not in the mood. If today I could be invisible I would. If you can treat me as if I am not here, I would appreciate it. Thank you!  ..." to sleep, perchance to dream, aw that is the rub, for in that sleep of death what dreams will come"...HAMLET

         Do you allow the guy to open doors and pull out chairs?    Do you all the guy to pay? If no, who should pay for what?    Is going dutch in or out?    Sending flowers to a guy yes or no?    3rd date rule still apply ;) ?    How long before double dates?    IF you spend the night at his or her house, what to bring?    Okay everyone need a debate from both genders on this one. Dating do's and dont's. I have a few questions to ask, since as most of you know I am back in the hetro dating world! People I need your help. I want to hear from the girls and the boys on this one!

Also, on the flip side:  Can you be just a friend to someone you are in love with but, only wants you in there life as a friend?

       Partying like a Rockstar again. I have to give a shout out to my girl Trish! Things got a bit ROWDY the other night. Understand that we try ... let me take that back - I try to be a peaceful individual. However, people get drunk and try to get "boudy body bot" it. I have the ability of easily ignoring when people get stupid. Unfortunately,Trish did jump in to my defense and ended up hurt. We both took care of them however, and they look alot worse off, U'all wish her a quick recovery. To broken ribs are no joke! Love ya! Feel better!

      My throat is killing me. OMG I woke up friday morning and my throat was  on fire. I sucked it up took some vitamin c drank hot liquids. NOGO just kept getting worse. So I did alittle self diagnosis and realized I must be trying to get sick. So I look in my medicine closet and saw it bear. Then I looked in my kitchen and found the rest of my Everclear. I figure hey it should be able to kill any germs. I took 4 shots and now my throat is even worse. Any ideas?    urlLink http://www.therockstar.org/index2.html

        urlLink      Bad Boys, they are suppose to protect and serve, right? Not on this day. My saturn stalled out and I was stuck in traffic, one cop offered to push it across the street untill another officer refused to allow him and said that the CSPD can not be liable for the vehicle, and needed to call a tow truck. Ain't that a bitch?
