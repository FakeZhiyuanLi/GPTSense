      While online looking at Pokemon episode guides I found out about Pokemon Housou translated it means Pokemon Broadcast in english which is separate show from the actual Pokemon TV series, which shows what goes on in other places while Ash is away in Hoenn. This show currently airs only in Japan.  It appears to be a good cartoon series only thing now is for it to air in the USA and UK in english other than that all we can do is wait and see if they will begin airing the episodes or if tey will just stick with the current Pokemon Advance. First Aired December 2002 on Japanese TV on Tuesdays at 7:00 PM.

      As you may or may not know Trini.com is a local Trinidad and Tobago website.   The problem is that it used to be a good site at one point but recently (2 months ago) it just seems to be going down the drain when it comes to its services such as it's SMS or Chat services.  Currently I don't have any anti-spyware software installed to trap these spyware programs, so I was using their SMS service which I was used to using for some time now but when I tried to send my message it would just stop and go to a next page full of pop-ups and ads.  And if that is not bad enough it installs a hand full of harmful programs on your system such as Keylogers, Trojans and Spyware.  Eventhough I have Norton Antivirus 2004 on my system and the Google toolbar that is supposed to block ads they did'nt even detect it eventhough I have the latest version of both.  The only solution that their is don't visit the site or make sure that you have Anti-Spyware software installed.

      Today I bought Mario vs Donkey Kong for the GBA after looking online for it all week and I think that now i am addicted to it.  It is one of the best games I have ever played eventhough it is on a small screen the graphics are good and the sound is better with voices and cut scenes it is worth owning I would say yes to anyone who is thinking of buying it.  So I will give it a 5 out of 5 but that is just me, leave you comments and tell me what you think...

"Sony is considering adding PSX and TiVo-like functionality to the PlayStation 3. And if it does, the sticker price on the unit could climb as high as $500.

      I have recently visited G4Techtv's Kevin Rose website and saw that he talked about http://www.allofmp3.com/.  A Russian site which allows you to download music (mp3's) and Music Albums, Kevin says "They seem to offer a ton of albums in like 10 different high end audio codecs."  I visited the site but found that it was a cool site but it was the way TheScreenSavers said never use Kazaa to download music again.  The said that it was the kazaa killer, I think that it was such a broad statement that still no matter which option you use they are both border line the law.  So take you pick?

      I dont know if you remember a few years ago there was a Tv show called Samurai Pizza Cats, it was one of my favourite shows but that was when I was about 5 or something at the time so I dont really remember any of the episodes but recently (a month ago) Garthlyn had a comic with a Pizza cats article in it so I did some searching online and I found Episode 1 on a P2P network.

      What more can I saw about the Sakura Cardcaptors movie that it was the best ever and yeah I feel sorry for those who live in N.America who dont get Cartoon Network Latin America.  Anyway I had to do a lot of subtitling and other work but I done and are ready to burn to DVD. If you guys want the movie check Kazaa or BoxTorrent.com they both have it but I think Kazaa is the better bet download time wise.

      As you may have noticed I have added some new sections to my site so you can check them out and let me know what you think.  Anyway today is the first day of summer and so happy summer.  Yesterday I was doing some seaching on Google for Cardcaptors episodes downloads and I was in luck when I found out that there is a torrent site with Season 1-3 and Movie 1 & 2 but there is only one problem the files are about 3Gb per season so at this rate I'll be done next year. PS you guys dont worry I will post all the links and info in the new CCS page so you can download them too.

      After the conclusion of the Battle City Tournament, deep below the sands of Egypt, an ancient evil has awakened. Anubis, who was defeated centuries ago by Yugi's mysterious alter ego -- the ancient Pharaoh -- has returned for revenge. Wielding the power of the Eighth Millennium Item, Anubis is determined to destroy Yugi and take over the world! there is no offical release date but it can be expected soon as there are only about 8-7 episodes remaining in the series so that means that in order for everthing to match up the next season can't start until the movie is released.

      I have recently gotten into the whole DBZ Universe I was not a big fan in the past because at that time on the WB they would air episodes daily but it was dificult to view.  Later on more recently within a year or two Cartoon Network took up the series, you may ask then what is the problem.  The problem is that we here only get the Latin America CN so that their is an advantage and disadvantage which is that we get to see some cartoon an hour or week before North America but on the other hand some shows are in Spanish.  Yes I can speak some spanish but not to the extent to translate an entire DBZ episode.  Anyway since this is the case I bought the DBZ 8 The Movie and some episodes This movie was is one of the best anime movies I have ever seen but there are not all English episodes in the series so it would be to costly to locate and buy all the DVD's so if anyone knows any good DBZ download sites please post or plan B is KaZaa or Warez them.

      What is the point in buying either of the animes on DVD if you only get about 4 episodes and some lame features.  Why cant they just make a set with all the episodes in 1 Box Set and just raise they price.  I mean that there are sites out there where you can download all the episodes at good quality.  The logic is that I have some download episodes, some new and some long and forgotten and they fact is that I dont watch them anymore.  And plus it works for a positive in that I would have never even watch or hear about them so they are getting fans, and because I am a fan I would go out and buy related stuff.

      Sorry about being offline again but I was very busy but I am now.  This month I'm looking around to buy the Inu Yasha episodes and the Yu Yu hakusho Movies so you guys can leave your suggestions for amine to upload in the comment areas.  On to site News I am planning to create some sort of anime shrine to place all of the anime that have been request but wouldn't be worth having a page also expect some media files within this week up, plus a photo gallery, Manga and a Anime TV feed but in the trial mode not to nuke the server.
