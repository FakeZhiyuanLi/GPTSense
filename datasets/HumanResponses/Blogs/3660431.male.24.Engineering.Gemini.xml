      got quite a few negative comments on being a personal trainer and california fitness centre...hmmm... some say its competitive and some say its sales orientated.... maybe i should reconsider on giving up my present job?? not unless they give me a pay increment!!! or maybe i shouldn't worry so much and hinders myself from broadening my horizon... this is me, sometimes, i just hate it. worry too much. think too much. plan too much. i've already told myself, go have a try, if you don't like that way of life, turn back and be a design engineer again. i'm still young, still need experience, still have many more things in life to experience. ok ok ok ok enough of thinking, Mr Brain needs a rest too. pumped my shoulders today, hmmm... feeling tired... had a quick but intense workout and got myself outta the gym, don't wanna overtrain... bought myself a timberland tee while on the way back home. nice design but not the colour i wanted, but anyway, it looks cool on me at least.hhahaaha.

       woke up way too early today... feeling the burning sensation allover my body.. musting be the stacking of TRIBEX &amp; NITRIX at work again...   was too busy, too tired to blog the past week, everyday at work sucks, project after project i finished, project after project come again.. blew my top twice in office this week, they took me for granted, thinking i'm a too nice guy and they could bully me? BIG MISTAKE! Jerry could be a very nice guy when he is treated the same way, he would everyday node his head and smile at you, but when you fucking get over his limit, he'll just tear your fuckiing ass apart! get it? don't push your luck with me, you won't want to! these unfortunate mudder fuggers learned their lesson the hard way, so be it, they jolly well deserve it for treating me like a pile of shit!   heard that the bonus this time round isn't as attractive as before, those who got their appraisal turn into zombie... the rest like me would just have to wait, fuck! must they do this?   awesome awesome week of training, put on another kilogram of muscle, my shoulders, pecs, back, arms and legs are growing well! pumped from day till nite and day again! NITRIX is really a fucking good shit! getting 1-AD next next with george and kenneth, just couldn't wait to get it and train to see results!! haha... I'm an Iron FreaK!

       Every time some&nbsp;newbie skinny guys&nbsp;comes up to me with a question, I am reminded of when I first started training. Yeah, I read the magazines and tried hard to differentiate between the real info and the bullshit. I was young and didn't know shit from shinola. I remember reading some stuff from the so-called "big boys" of the sport. I can't fully explain my frustration with their attitudes. When they wrote, their condescending tone was enough to make me want to fuckin' smash something.These guys acted like if you couldn't spend 40 hours in the gym each week, get 10 hours of sleep every night (plus a 3 hour nap in the daytime), then you would never amount to anything. The question I had, as many of you probably do, is how do I work? Who pays for all this shit? How do I possibly support the lifestyle of a lazy bum, as they described? The conclusion I soon came to was as follows: You fuckin' don't. You don't get to float around acting like a pro when you're not. You don't have to sleep 100 hours a week and take daytime naps and not work and forget about your family.What you do have to do is start taking your workouts seriously and set serious goals for the immediate as well as the long term future. You also have to do something most people can't do: Think for yourself. Don't be led by one-hit, flash-in-the-pan superstars. In this sport, most bodybuilders are a legend in their own minds. Divorce yourself from the idea that there is an easy way to step into this arena. 99% of this life is what you make of it, so if your life sucks, you suck... Resist the temptation to quit or make excuses and don't stand on the shoulders of others to shape your image or your body.My point is simply this: If you want something so bad that you would sell your soul, then there isn't one thing that will stop you... Never believe that the circumstances of your life dictate that you can't become a huge, rampaging, fucking beast. Instead, use the situation you're in to motivate yourself to become an Animal. Train like someone is gonna' kill you if you fail. Remember,  all we have is what we do in this life ...  if you're doing nothing, then you're just waiting to die .

      What matters in life is what you do. Not how much shit you can talk. Anytime you want to see me at work, look me up in the weight room and I will show you the meaning of pain and transcending limits. You want to beat me, don't miss a meal, because I won't. Don't quit on a set because I'll always be one set ahead of you. Don't walk out of my gym without leaving your guts spilled on the floor because you can bet your ass, I won't.

      Bodybuilding is war. Once you start, you can't back out and say you're sorry. When you enter a war, you plan for invasion. Every piece of the puzzle has a place. You have to assume tactical command and take responsibility for your theater of operations. The competitive life you save may be your own.  Ever wonder why other athletes are passing you by? Maybe it's because you're at a nightclub, shaking your ass to the early hours of the morning. These are the same guys who attack my style of training. These fat fucks whine about how you can only do so many sets for this, and so many for that. As if they know. What divine power came to them and told them all of those secrets? I know when I'm done, if I'm not standing on top, it wasn't out of laziness.  There is no accident. No shortcut. No easy way out. There's only one thing you can't bottle or stick in your ass. It's a work ethic. Blood, guts and hard work are my main tools. Rage and anger is what fuels my intensity. Muhammad Ali once said there is no shame in going down. The only shame is if you don't get back up.

      Everyone has a vision of what his life should be. It never works out. What you got to do is focus on one thing and make that one thing your life. Make no excuses. Rip yourself apart every single fucking day trying to get it right. Do that and at least you'll be able to look at yourself in the mirror as a man. Maybe I won't win any contests, but I know there's honor in the struggle. When it comes to the struggle, you can't take any prisoners. You got to fight harder than that guy on the other side of the line. You got to train like you got a gun to your head.  Nothing in life worth having comes easy. When the bombs fly and the roof falls down around you, all you can do is hope that your foundation is strong enough to withstand the pressure. All you can pray for is that all your hard work will pay off. That you weren't lazy and didn't overlook something that might have helped you prepare for the battle. All things in life have a purpose and a reason for happening. User every second, every fiber in your body, every last breath to make things happen. Everyone fears death. But I say this: Live proud and fight as hard as you can. If you do, you'll live beyond your time on this earth.

      every legs session kills... man.. my quads are so sore now even i were to move an inch, it hurts like mad...dead tired... theres one thing today that really pissed me off! the clown in my gym actually got first place in the 42nd national bodybuilding championship junior catagory! man.. i just couldn't beleive it! let me explain, the reason i call he and his gang, which consist of 3 person, clowns, becos they do all the impossible weight for them to handle and groan and groan in the gym!! man, they're so damn egoistic that they'll say aloud" how come ppl watch us train as if we're on steriods?" i'd like to tell him, "boy, you ain't nowhere near a bodybuilder and you know nuts when it comes to roids!"  they just live in their own world. even he won the 1st place, he'll not earn a single respect from me!! not until he does his sets and reps properly and compete in the MAN catagory, and not some fucking UNDER 21, JUNIOR catagories, JUNIOR ARE FOR BOYS NOT MAN! he is just plain lucky to win it cos he is the biggest in his catagory. if i were to do bodybuilding instead of martial arts in my teens, i'd have tons of trophies sitting at home now!! imagine, he must have started out big in size, becos his bone structure is tall, long and big and it took him 3 yrs of training? ME? i was an average joe weighing at 64kgs when i first started, now after 3 hardcore years, i'm 86kgs. not ripped though, but i do carries alot of muscle mass, much more than him! i still couldn't believe the standard of the junior catagory... thats just sick, just sick..... if he were to ever compete next year in the MAN's OPEN, i'll be damn sure he doesn't stand a chance...never...

      woohoo... collected my powerhouse gym gear this morning! the tee just looked too good on me..man...just too good...hah..sounds like an egomaniac eh?? weekend!! yes! meeting up with georgie and kangming later this evening for dinner and talk cock session.... headr from yaokun that those pathetic bodybuilder wannabes taking part in the 42nd National Bodybuilding Championship are being described as 'scawny'..hahahha.. THEY THEM DAMN WELL DESERVED IT!! they just don't understand a thing about bodybuilding... to them being fit, or simply haing some ab muscle or pea sized biceps makes them a bodybuilder...C'MON! WAKE THE FUCK UP!! if it was ever so simple, you won't see those big boys that includes me, training like thers no tomoro in the gym, pushing and pulling huge weights... or better still if thats bodybuilding, 45lbs plates won't even exist in the gym... we won't have to eat 6 high protein meals a day, won't have to drink 5 protein shakes a day, don't have to count the carbs you take in evryday, won't have to take supplements evryday!! if thats that easy, my grandma could be a bodybuilder too!! damn....

      start of a new month... hope thats a good month ahead with no hassles, no worries.... yeah..the powerhouse gym bodybuilding gear i bought over the net from US of A has arrived today and was delivered to my house...but...no one were at home to sign over the parcel...so, i gotta go to s'pore post to collect it myself. hmmm...would collect it on sat morning! feels kinda excited!! thought that it would take quite some time... but arrived in 2weeks.... as usual, busy and tired day at office... but seems okay...getting used to it... triceps days at gym wasn't really good as i tot it would be... maybe i should superset it with biceps instead of hitting them alone..too small of da muscle group to train solely on a single session... biceps day tommorrow, hope it would be as good as the previous week...

        The Reason - Hoobastank    I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4] I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you  .... just a cool song that I like very much since its release....

      another week has passed... an average week with no major upturns or downfalls.. same moody week like all the previous..i guess. went fishing yesterday with chang and george. george was a first timer, so he landed zero fish, me and chang each had 2 barramundis. taman jurong wasn't really a 'promised haven' of fishing. think those guys in fishingkaki.com just exaggerated... did legs today as usual, not much of power today, i guess its the after effect of the energy draining fishing session yesterday. not good man. isn't suppose to be this way! I want to pump legs heavy! but.... i did hit the max weights, but i didn't hit the max repetitions i usually do, damn.... guess i got increase the cardio from once a week to twice a week...shit, i'm feeling a bit fat. and i don't want to be a fat fuck. but.... staying cut while growing big is no easy shit man, definately no. its gonna be a long, tiring, boring, sick, moody, tough road ahead... no choice, i pick this road, i'll walk to the end.

         Réflexions        Believe in one person: Yourself. Everything flows from that pool.   Don’t be afraid of pain. It will teach you.   Define your surroundings; don’t let them define you.   Don’t be a fucking pussy. Life hurts. So does loneliness, and so does change. But they are all necessary for you to become a better person.   Make things happen. Don’t wait for them.   Quitting is a habit, as is winning and losing. The second two happen to everyone. The first one should never happen to anyone.   Lead by example. Never become someone you aren’t proud of.

       Damn, all the hard work and all I get is a miserable 100dollars increment and a 1/2 month bonus? do i have to stoop so low and flush my pride down the pipe to accept that as a fact? hell no! and he know from that moment a threw the fucking increment letter right back to him. what about those posers who only know how to act busy and get over 1K of increment? does working overtime means he is busy and not working overtime means i'm free? hell no! a productive worker need not work OT like mad! fuck it, just fuck it, all my hard work is only worth a hundred bucks to that mother fucker, that worthtless son of the bitch, that asshole with no self esteem and self respect...    the more i think of it, the more my blood boils and the more hungry i'm to taste his blood.    to me now, if my work is not appreciated so be it, from this damn day onwards, my heart is dead for this company, no more whole hearted work, until i manage to find a better job. and i will find one from today onwards!    my heart really sank, really sank, whats the point of working so hard? recognition? bonus? increment? prospect? I find none here...send me some signs god, if there are any...
