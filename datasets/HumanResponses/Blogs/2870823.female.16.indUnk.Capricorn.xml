      the kind where every emotion you've ever had comes thru your throat as you scream and your face gets wet with tears and sweat? The kind that just bubbles up out of you and when your done you take a big breath and immedatly feel better?  Yeah, I need one of those cries right about now. Why? I haven't got a fucking clue. I wish I did. I mean I REALLY wish I did, but I don't.  Well I was writing a story were this chick is crying b/c shes on this plane and is going to Korea but she doesn't really want to, but its for her own safety, and then I was reading some poorly written fan fic and well, I just get so furstrated with my life that I feel like hurting someone. Or screaming at someone. Or just kicking AND screaming at the same time...at some one.  Yeah, I'm a freak, aren't I? Yeah well, I've also gotten into a band called DBShinki. I think they're a really cool ban-well more like pop group (think N*SYNC b4 the fro) and since they're in Korea (or Japan, but more than likely Korea) and I'm here in a small god forsaken town in the middle of Misery, all that this fasination with this group can pertain to is a simple crush. (Not like the one on what's-his-face who is now dating Ms. I bend over in my Short-shorts) Yeah, I'm uh, something of a freak, geek, loser combo.  Well, when my computer stops locking up, I'll post a picture of the group so I can stare at it to supress the scream.

      Well, apperently it is. Why? Because if a guy is your friend and not your boyfriend, then something is tottaly wrong with that. Or so says, well scratch that, he didn't actually say it but this it the vibe I'm getting from Willies best friend Ryan. He doesn't like me, and well I don't really like him. Or his girlfriend. Or anything else that is happening to be going on in my life.

      I think I have a crush.  Ok, so I realize that having a crush is like having a baby. Either you iz or you ain't.  So, lets just say I'm siiting on the edge of the bathtub stareing at the box of pegrancy tests, wondering how the HELL this happened. Now, if a girl has a crush, she's usually elated, happy, you know the drill. Damn, some girls get downright giggleiy. But not me. I'm a heartless. Yeah, its sorta like a bitch minus the attitude. I mean I'm mean sometimes, but usually I'm a nice person... until I get annoyed. THEN I'm a Bitch. Just go ask this kid Matt. He knows what I'm talking about.  But me having a crush on someone is just... not good. Why? Two words. Over-active Imagination. Ok, so that was more like three but anyways. When you like someone, you think about them an awful lot, right? Yeah, well for the average person this may hold true, but I ALREADY think TOO much. Not about him, just in general. But thats what I get when I don't have any friends. But not only is this bad for my mind, this guy would be bad for well, everything else. First off, hes a jerk. So hes nice SOMETIMES but hes really just an ass. Then, half the time he doesn't even think about what he says. And this is bad because why? you ask? Well, I'm knowen as "the nice girl" at school. You know, the "excuse me, pardon me, if you you would be as so kind to step away from my locker, thank you..." No, come to think of it I'm more like, "EXCUZE me! Hey! I said excuse me! I need to get to my locker! HELL-O?!?!?! Are you listening to me? Ex-CUZE me!" and then I'm late to class cuz Angies boyfriend decides that the bite I gave him last time wasn't enought to break the habit of standing in front of my locker.  But back to what I was saying. I'm a polite kid. I've never gotten into a fight at this school (and I'd like to keep it that way but those jocks are really pushin' it!) and well I'm nice. And well, if I dated a jerk like him, do you know how many girls, and even some guys, tell me that I could do (so much) better? A whole HELL of alot. Hes not well liked.  But the way I realized is that he sits cattycorner from me and well I was staring at the back of his head, and before I knew it, I was writeing his name, and then caught myslef while I was putting a little heart around it. Yeah I know.  I'm slowly spiraling downward in this slow bathtub tornado that leads to the drain of mental health. I'll be down the drain sooner or later, i just wish that it would hurry up. I wish I could just act crazy now, you know, have that insane episode were just everything comes out ass-backwards and I can just say that its a personality defect of mine, you know that little quirk that makes me recongized. But I think the main reason I like him is because hes NOT that nice guy. Hes not who I should even CONSIDER going out with. Hes the poplar opposite and I that makes him appeal to me. I guess. (Someone tell me where I am!)

       urlLink 12 Reasons Gay Marriage will Ruin Society   I found this while searching for an English paper. I have to write about my opinion of Same Sex Marriages. I'd tell you what I think, but I'll let the link do that for me...  (I bought a compass to help me find myself, but so far, I've gotten lost on the way to school...Twice and I don't even live 5 minutes away...)

      after I read this when I was done posting. Capricorn(December 22 - January 19) Your optimism begins to fade -- and this is not a bad thing. This doesn't mean that you become pessimistic. It means that you are being more realistic. Your opinions can go a long way now as others realize that you have your feet on the ground and your thoughts anchored to the sensible truth. Still, you might be fighting an internal temptation to take on too much. Don't scatter your energies; concentrate them.  Yeah, well I thought it was interesting. (I'm like a nameless soul wandering about, too stuborn to ask for directions...)

      stay in it long enough, you fell like you can't breathe. Or maybe that's just how my situation makes the weather feel. Or maybe its just humid. It's been one of those days where my legs are unsure of the feet they rest upon but I can trust my feet, but sometimes my legs won't follow. I did my laundry today and counted 16 towels. I didn't even think I had 16 towels, but then again, I do live with a family of people who think that a shower means you get wet for five seconds and the word soap isn't even included in your vocabulary. I don't know.  It's amazing that I'm in such a shitty mood.  I should be happy.  I mean I'm on Springbreak. The goddamn springbreak that I strained thru six hours of pointless map testing to enjoy, yet I'm sitting here, getting pissed at my mother because she doesn't listen to me and getting pissed at myself b/c I haven't even tried to talk to her and well... Ever have one of those days where the world has screwed you over so many freaking times that you realize that you just don't give a fuck anymore? Yeah, its one of those... But I can blame this all on the fact that I just found out that one of my favorite characters dies in one of my favorite animes.  But I can't tell you which one or who it is b/c then I'd be a spoilsport.  Catch ya later... (still don't know who I am...)

      Well, I guess not.  I was trying to think of something witty and wise to say but when I sit down to my computer, I instantly head for different things, ie fanfiction, song lyrics, anime deals, ect. ect.  But my life is pretty boring and I can accept that.  I think. So I just wanted to say that and I have to go now because Adult Swim is on and they're showing Family Guy at 10:30. So gotta go. ( I would put my name down here as closing but I don't have a clue at who the hell I am right now. Or actually at anytime...)

      theres like nothing on here, besides the internet and a few *choice* programs, but not my beloved Word. I want to type a few things up, but I would have to do it in Notepad, and well, thats just ghetto. Strict ghetto.  Anyways, I keep playing that song, Sonny by New Found Glory, just because I like it and it matches my mood, and well I can really relate to it. I know how it is "when you lose a part of yourself to somebady you know, it takes a lot to let go", but I just love that line and "an empty chair at all the tables". *cough* Anyways. my water tastes really funny. But thats not what I wanted to say.  Now is the time for my MOVIE SUGGESTION OF THE WEEK!!!! For this week, since its monday, the movie I suggest is  Vampire Effect  (aka: The Twins Effect) starring Charlene Chui and Gillian Chung, (it also has a [very funny] cameo by Jackie Chan).  (BTW, Edison Chen is hot.) Okay, so this is either a "I LOVED it" movie or a "Oh my gosh, What the HELL did I just sit thru?" movie, and well I thought that it was really good (considereing it was made to show off the acting talents of Chui and Chung, who make up the Cantonese pop group, Twins.). Its a typical Hong Kong vampire flick, and I don't think it was trying to be anything else, so it shouldn't be one of those things where you're comparing the stunt work to the matrix, or the comedy to Monty Python. Its just a straight HKV flick. Thats it. But as for a straight HKV flick, it was pretty hilarous and kick ass. But thats just my opinion.  (and I just found out from  urlLink rottentomatoes.com  that theres to be a sequel, and yeah, I'll probably buy both of them) About Edison Chen's character: "Kazaf is a character to be liked and sympathized with. He's nice, sleeps in a dope tricked-out coffin, and is played by Edison Chen. That mean's he's totally hot and ultra-sensitive to the needs of teenybopper-type girls everywhere. If all vampires looked like Edison Chen, victims would be beating the door down to get to him." (from  urlLink lovehkflim.com  ) Sorry, thought that was cute. Sooooooooooooo, whos as bored as I am? Yeah, well, this computer sucks. And I was going to do something else, but I can't remember. So bye.

       "The Story So Far" - New Found Glory   I can't remember the time or place,  or what you were wearing,  it's unclear about how we met,  all I know it was the best conversation that I've ever had,  to this day I never found someone,  with eyes as wide as yours,  I've been searching up and down this coast,  overlooking what I need the most  did you notice I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say,  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again,  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be,  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be  and everything else is irrelevant,  to the story so far,  a coincidence that you looked like her from afar,  is it true that you like to sleep alone?  Or is it what you just tell everyone?  Did you notice that I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be  and when the world turns over  ill keep my ears to the wall  and when the world turns over  ill keep my feet straight on the ground  did u notice I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say,  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again,  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be...  __________________________________________________________________  "The Goodbye Song" - New Found Glory   last year was one of our better years in a life full of separation  it's ok to second guess just as long as you remember she's gone..  in the bright of day it might seem like the stars are gone they never leave,  they come back when the sun moves on it's over now you watched me  as i turned around it's not why, but how the light is on i'll come home  now i feel it's been such a long time since her eyes have met with mine  i feel it's been such a long time i'm glad you've made up your mind  it's hurting me from the inside  if i only had something to say maybe  if i prove that i'm right will it still be safe to stay?  __________________________________________________________________  "Sonny" - New Found Glory   I'm sorry  I heard about the bad news today A crowd of people around you  Telling you it's okay And everything happens for a reason When you lose a part of your self To somebody you know It takes a lot to let go Every breath that you remember Pictures fade away but memory is forever An empty chair at all the tables And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down But it's better where you're going anyway I'm sorry  I heard about the bad news today It's really hard to get through Tough times and long days But it really just depends on the season For now we'll say goodbye  We know it's not the last time I've lost the best part of my day But it's better where you're going anyway This is the last thing I will remember  It's better where you're going anyway  __________________________________________________________________   "Adieu" - Yoko Kanno, sung by Emily Billenger (i think)Cowboy Bebop Soundtrack   Been a fool, been a clown Lost my way from up and down And I know, yes, I know And I see in your eyes that you really weren't surprised at me At all Not at all And I know by your smile It's you Don't care for me Don't cry, let's say goodbye Adieu It's time to say goodbye I know that in time It will just fade away It's time to say goodbye I stand alone And watch you fade away like clouds High up and in the sky I'm strong and so cold As I stand alone Goodbye, so long Adieu Oh, how I love you so Lost in those memories And now you've gone I feel the pain Feeling like a fool Adieu My love for you burns deep inside me So strong Embers of times we had And now, here I stand Lost in a memory I see your face and smile Oh how I love you so Lost in those memories And now you've gone I feel the pain Feeling like a fool Adieu My love for you burns deep inside me So strong Embers of times we had And now here I stand Lost in a memory I see your face and smile   __________________________________________________________________  "Call Me Call Me"   I close my eyes and I keep seeing things, Rainbow waterfalls, sunny liquid dreams.

Taint it, own it, chase it away. You couldn't make them, so we had to break them. Words that we couldn't say. Sometimes, baby, we make mistakes. Dark and hazy, prices we pay. I sit here on my shelf, just talking to myself. Words that we couldn't say. Same day maybe we'll make it right. Until that day, long endless nights. We couldn't say them so now we just pray them. Words that we couldn't say. We couldn't say them, so now we just pray them. Words that we couldn't say. Someday maybe we'll make it right. Until that day, long endless nights.

Words that we couldn't say.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Okay, so I started listening to some songs on my computer that my little brother had downloaded, so that explains the NFG songs, but I have to lyrics to Adieu stuck up on my wall and felt like listening to the song and that got me wanting to listen to other Cowboy Bebop songs, and well I loved that anime, and the soundtrack is awesome, so, i dunno. Its just really freakin' cool, yo.

         Okay, so this is DongBangShinKi! Aren't they hot? (YES.) Yes! Okay, so I got finally figured out about image hosting thingys and yeah well, I'm gonna put up lots and lots of pictures so I won't have to save all of them! Whoooooooo-hooooooooooooo!     This is Hero Young Woong Jae Joong. Yeah, they all have like 15 different names. Basically Young Woong is korean for Hero, and Kim Jae Joong is his real name. I just call him Jae, but isn't he sexy? Yeah, he is.     Then, this is max Choi Kang Chang Min. Don't ask me what his real name is, I forgot, but I call him Chang Min. It seems to fit him, doesn't it? BTW, hes 16, my age, but doesn't he look like hes like, I don't know, 11? *cough* Um, Yeah...     And this is Micky Park Yoo Chun, striking his "DAYUM, I  know  I'm sexy!" pose, and well, hes all serouis and sexy and YUM, and *cough* yeah...  And heres Uno Jung Yun Ho. Hes sexy in "I'm your older brothers friend who's always nice to you" way.     And then theres Xiah Kim Jun Su, who when I first saw him, thought he looked like a jerk. But hes really nice to look at now, *giggles*     So, I got those pics off varouis forums and am useing  urlLink imageshack  to host the pics, and its pretty cool and easy, and well, see I didn't have to take home that stupid fucking baby-think-it-over (which cried FIVE fucking times last night) home today, and I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY ABOUT IT. (And I'm not having a kid until I have enought money to afford a nanny.) OH, do you want to know something my friend Michelle told me today that I found extremely funny and disturbing at the same time? Well, her new boyfriend, Nick, wants to teach her how to K-I-S-S! It was so funny when she told me, but now that I think about it, it makes me sad b/c she was kind of asking me in a round about way for advice, and I haven't kissed a guy for about 4 years now, and what the HELL am I suppose to tell her? I couldn't think of anything besides "Make sure he doesn't make you do anything you don't wanna do" and of course I got the response of "But he goes to church!" and then I told her that I'm sure that Hitler went there too. So I came off as a very concerned friend, which I am, don't get me wrong, but I can't rememeber kissing a guy for the life of me! GRRRRRRRRR. That SUCKS. And I don't have any guy friends who I would want to have as bf's so I just...........grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.......I don't know. This sucks. Anyways, I was gonna show you guys Teddy's bad shirt (it says "One BAD Motha Fucka" *giggles* Ohhhhhhh, how I love that word!), but the bad side of imageshack is comeing out...  __________________________________________________________________ "Cowards die many times before their deaths;  the valiant never taste of death but once."- William Shakespeare  "Here's a little bit of cheap advice to be taken in an hour of need.

      I swear I am! It cries for like five fucking minutes and won't shut up! I hate it! Its so fucking stupid!!!!!!!! And then, my stupid English teacher started to bug me for an assignment I didn't get done, and she won't get the fuck off my back about it and I turned it in YESTERDAY! And then, to top it off, I'M FUCKING SICK AND MY ASSHOLE OF A FUCKING DOCTOR SAYS HE CAN'T BLODDY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And then Michelle says that I need to lighten up, and I'm sitting there at lunch, a buck short because the motherfucking soda machine decided to eat it! So, it was a motherbloddyfucking good fucking day. The end.  No, ok so its not the end, I originally wanted to start off saying all the bad stuff that happened to me and then leave you with all the good stuff, but all the good stuff I can think of is, the computer is FINALLY in MY room, I'm going to post a story in DBShinKi forums, Joe is having an end of the year party, and school is out in 9  F U C K I N G  D A Y S! ! ! ! ! ! ! Yes! Finally, maybe this summer will be G O O D. I hope so. Well, I can't think of anything to say except that I hate being sick, I had a stupid dream about DBShinKi (they were at walmart and I got thier autographs, how fucking depressing is that? I've had better ones about my 6th grade math tutor!), and I hate my cat Kiana b/c she shit in my room and pissed on my clean pair of jeans. Lets see, anything else I want to rant about? Oh, Dads suppose to show me how to reboot the computer so I guess that will come in handy, and I'm suppose to get my OWN webpage, but that hasn't happened yet. DUH. When I do get my own, I'll have a forum, and I won't have that many fucking rules like some forums *cough*soompi*cough*.  Anyways, I can't think of anything else so I'm going to go read or write or something. C~Ya.

      So on top of being on my period (don't you love how open I am with you?) I also have allergies. Yeah, I'm on some heavy medicine and I should be asleep upstairs but I just wanted to say something. And I forgot what it was. Hm, well, it'll come back to me when I'm no where near a computer and then I'll forget about it and I'll never be able to tell you. Anyways, I'm listening to music right now, and it sounds like someone is yelling for me upstairs, but that isn't possible because they're all asleep. It is 11:04 right now. Hm, well goodnight, and try to sleep.

      and then soaking in a hot tub full of jasmine scented bubbles with a guy from DBShinKi (it doesn't matter who, as long as he's obedient).  Anyways, well no, I would actually like to expand further upon how obedient I need Jae Joong or Uno or Xia, but um, well this is a G-rated show, right? Yeaaah, riiiiiiiiight. Well, I got a new kitten. Yeah, its a calico one, and her name's Lani. Why? I don't know. Her full name is  Lani Harriet Nemele Regina Calpurinia Xina Frenchy Edward the Third . I like it. Well, I'm now (again) into BoA. Not the english band, BÔA, but the korean, kpop princess BoA* (might as well add that lil' star thing). Shes cute when she wants to be, but annoying when shes trying to act all innocent. I mean she basicly idolizes Briteny Spears, and she tries to act innocent? Are prost-a-tots innocent? (No.) But, well I have to go take another bathroom break (its every five minutes since I had that soda).  I think I love you, I'm not sure.  Oh, I want to write more, I just wish today was Friday. Well Love.

      But then, something happens, something that I can't explain right now, and then you realize, "fuck that, thats shit, how could I want that? I wasn't thinking, I don't want that thing/person/feeling. Get it away from me!!!"  Yeah, thats what today was like for me. I was just sitting there, playing with tarot cards, listening to korean music, my walls were painted green, I had books strewn across the floor, I was completly alone, nobody was calling me, no one was asking me if I was alright, I was COMPLETLY AND UTTERLY ALONE, and guess what? I really wished I had someone to talk to.  I guess I'm l o n e l y. Wow, well, who knew? I guess what I'm trying to say is that, if I had the chance to describe myself, lonely wouldn't be a word I would pride myself on being. Neglected maybe, b/c that means you didn't choose to be ignored like l o n e l y implies, b/c l o n e l y implies, well means actually in my opinoin that I  want  to be this way. And I don't, I just am, b/c I made myself this way. I pushed other people away, some I did intentionaly, others I did covertly so that I didn't even know I was doing it until it was out in the open like a flesh wound.  And well, here I am, typeing to you, trying to convince myself that there is a  you , and well, its not working. There is no  you , there is no  me , there is no  we . I'll never be a  we . I'll never say,  "Well, we were going to get the green drapes, but they didn't match the carpet so we went with the pink ones.  or  "I'm sorry, but we can't make it, we have to go to his parents house that weekend."  or something equally rediculase (i know I spellt that wrong) and well, I guess I'm just  l o n e l y  and  s i n g l e  and not likeing it.  This sucks. Everything sucks. I'm 16 fucking years old and here I am, unable to drive, I don't have a job, I'm not doing anything I like to do, I feel trapped, I want love, I want friends who want to spend time with me and will return my calls, I just want something thats not happening in this lifetime. I guess its just life thats not happening to me.  I WANT LIFE!  Yeah, when I say it that way, it sounds like I want a baby, but what I want is an Adventure that happens to me and only me!  I want a battle, a fight for good and evil, I want love lost and love returned, broken hearts and teary nights, love-filled passion and lustful gazes directed my way, I want battle scars and broken arms, I want to be at the brink of death and then brought back by sheer will!  I want to have an enimey so hatefilled that even Lucifer himself would cowarer under its shawdow, but I wouldn't b/c I would have those sought after qualities that make a hero a hero, and in that final battle, I would become victourouis by pluning a sword into the heart of a 50 foot dragon... And then I would wake up the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that forever and ever next to the one I love, next to the one that loves me... ha ha ha...wishful thinking, huh?

Well, it is. My word of the moment is: Motherfucker.  The word of the moment used in a sentance:  (as a noun) "Put your hands up Motherfuckers!" (heard at 1tym concert) (as a verb) "Don't try to motherfuck around with me!" (I used this today! *giggle*) (as an adjective) "Man, don't be such a motherfucking idoit and just jump!" (Used this on too *more giggles*) Yes, children, run around and use it often, like me, and get in trouble, like me, when you use motherfucker in a sentance. It's ok, ya stupid mothafucka. So I'm actually listening to 1tym's "Ready or Not" in English, and you thought I had a dirty mouth. Oh, and I just heard my word of the day!     "Do you wanna ride?

Jinusean, Perry)  Yeah, I like that song. And Without You, that ones good too, but I always cry when I hear it. Plus in the MV, Danny looks really hot. I'm actually trying to find a pic of him right now, BUT NO ONE HAS ONE, well, atleast no one on the soompi forums. Nevermind, found 'em.   So...I don't have a lot to say.... so I'll just let you read something....   She hated planes. Everyone knew that. But here she was, sitting next to the window, watching the clouds roll over the shaky wings of the plane. Her fear increased with every heartbeat as the wings shook in the wind that showed no mercy as the plane groaned around her. Doubt rose like the bile in her throat until it hit her heart where it stayed. ‘I shouldn’t be doing this. I shouldn’t be doing this. I really shouldn’t be doing this.’ The young girl thought as she twisted a paper napkin in her lap, her hands shaking. Her legs shook also, and suddenly her whole body had stood up to its own accord and was on its way down the small aisle of the plane to the tiny bathroom at the far end. She caught herself as she slid open the vacant bathroom, blinking for a few seconds before she remembered what she was doing as she looked around the small aircraft, wondering if anyone one had noticed that she spaced out, thinking that her brain certainty didn’t tell her body to take her to the bathroom. That’s when her nausea hit her, and she was suddenly very thankful she had spaced out. When she emptied the contents of her stomach, which wasn’t very much, she heard the stewardess knock on the door. “Miss? Miss? Are yoo alrigh’?” She could hear the woman’s accent through the door as she held her head above the toilet seat. “Uh, Yes, um, I'm alright. Just a little motion sickness.” She called out, tears running down her nose, dripping into the water.   And thats it. Hoped you liked it.  urlLink email  me if you did, b/c I waaannnnaaa know. Oh, heres a  urlLink pic  of 1tym, taken off a fan's planet site. And I was going to post one of DongBangShinKi, but can't b/c Blogger doesn't let me (don't ask me why, I just know I can't understand that stupid Hello program and don't really feel like simging up for more crap.)  But anyways, they're hot.  Specialy Jae Joong. And Choi Kang. And Micky. And Uno. And then theres Xiah, who kinda looks like a jerk to me, but a sexy one. I was really hoping that those links would work b/c I haven't a clue when it comes to html and whats that other one? I know it starts with a B or something, but this isn't even html I'm dealing with, right? Soooooooooooooooo I can't!!!!!!!!!!!!  But I'm actually really stupid about somethings on the computer but really smart about other things. And I don't feel like nameing those things so :P. Wellllll....I'm gonna go get some din-din, motherfucker (noun).  Peace out. OH!!!! B4 I go, IIII-FFFFF you know me,(as in real life *cough*joe*cough*) tell me, cuz I know that you know, so, I just want you to know that I know you know. Got It Motherfucker? Tootles.

      I mean, I  really   hate  Subway.  I don't like the food, and I don't like the people behind the counter.  Anyways, I have a MAJOR craving for a diet coke or some sort of soda. Its a really big craving. Anyways, my poor little cat Kiana had to go to the vet today. Me and my Dad found out that she's actually got herpies! Yes, appearntly cats can carry std's as well as the common cold, lukemia, and viruses. yay. I sooo wanted a pet that can carry clamidia. (I told my little brother to be careful and make sure it doesn't burn  when he pees. He gave me a wierd look while I laughed my ass off to Kiana walking around with that cone thing on her head.)  Oh, speaking of suprises, when me and dad pulled up in the driveway, my older brother was sitting in his car smoking a cigarette. The look on his face was so fucking hilarous. I laughed until I cried.  Oh, it was such a funny day today. My cat walks backwards, and my brother got caught smoking. I was sooo laughing my ass off today. Too bad you weren't there. I'm sure you would of found it fucking funny too. Well, I should go write. Promised someone I would. Catch ya l8ter.

      So, nothing exciting happened. Just went over to Joe's, watched people play DDR, played a lil' Mortal Kombat Triology, and then went Mini-golfing with Dawn and Joe. Thats its. Yeah, I was expecting more too.  Like, maybe someone finally telling me that the stupid secret admirers note was a FLIPPIN' fake, like I  know  it is, or maybe someone telling me that they'll miss me during the summer.  Yeah, but we  both  know stuff like that doesn't happen to me.  *SIGH* I'm bored. And pathetic. YAY! Well, I can't stop dancing. (Now I just sound like a psycho. Grreat.) HIP HOP CEREMONY!  *cough*cough* Sorry, I've been listening to 1tym again. (Uh-Oh! to be exact) and now One Luv is on and I looove this song. Don't ask why, just listen to it. You'll like it. Ahhhhhhhh, I luv some people.  Not telling who thou. You'll just hafta guess, and you'd be wrong and right, but not left, as thats the direction towards the heart that you can't get. Ahem. Anyways. I have to go now. Take Kiana to the vet. Post more later.

       I hate you. Yep, I sure do. Well, you hate me too. It's okay, I've known for a long time.  Of course thats how the conversation would go in my head.  Just. Don't. Ask. Its complicated in the way that theres nothing there. Nothing at all. And I know I'm not making sense, and I'm not suppose to. I'm only suppose to know what I'm talking about, so that you'll sit there and hope one day I'll tell you why I want to tell someone I hate them and why they hate me. But it won't happen and thats why you stick around. But, of course, this neat little trick has been used countless times by things that affect your life every single day, you just have to look for it. _____________________________________________ Ok, different subject. Do you know one of those people you just want to smack very hard on the mouth or just punch in the face b/c they just won't leave you alone? My little brothers like this. He acts out to get attention all of the time, and he doesn't realize that when he does, hes the only other person in the room! He just doesn't get it that people don't like him. He has fights with his friends all the time, he doesn't shower, and he wears the same clothes, every fucking day. Hes a disgusting aggrogant bastard of a person. Sometimes I'm amazed that he even thinks that the people he hangs out with are his friends. They don't like him. I know that, its just that he doesn't and I've told him this numerous times. Anyways. I hate him. __________________________________ Ahh! My computers locking up.  Post later.

      "Cocoon" - Jack Johnson  Well based on your smile I'm betting all of this Might be over soon But your bound to win Cause if I'm betting against you I think I'd rather lose But this is all that I have  So please Take what's left of this heart and use Please use only what you really need You know I only have so little So please Mend your broken heart and leave  I know it's not your style I can tell by the way that you move It's real, real soon But I'm on your side And I don't want to be your regret I'd rather be your cocoon But this is all that you have  So please Let me take what's left of your heart and I will use I swear I'll use only what I need I know you only have so little  So please Let me mend my broken heart and  You said this was all you had And it's all I need But blah blah blah Because it fell apart and I guess it's all you knew And all I have But now we have Only confused hearts and I guess all we have  Is really all we need  So please Let's take these broken hearts and use Let's use only what we really need You know we only have so little So please Take these broken hearts and leave... _______________________________________________ I like this song...might write a story to it or something...I'm weird.

      Yeah, like I'll forget. Well, ever have one of those moments, where if the world stopped and you felt nothing for a whole minute, that would be the greatest gift anyone could give you?  Yeah, I suggest you don't get that feeling when you're on a putt-putt golf course standing in the shade of a gaint plastic castle, while the guy who has a major crush on you listens to the words you randomly put into a song while Dawn takes her shot. He likes me, a whole hell of a lot. And I? Well, for me, I can't think of him in anyother way then the kid who buggs me for fifty cents after lunch is over and then gives me a hug that cracks my back. Him, on the other hand, thinks of me as, well I'm not sure. I suppose he thinks of me alot, but not too much since he ignored me at his party. Or maybe it was just one of those things. And of course when I say one of those things, I mean, I haven't a clue as to how the mind of an adolencent teenage boy works.  But me? I'm so tottaly wrong for him. Who wants a pesstimistic brooding sarcastic bitchy cynic for a girlfriend? Hes a really sweet guy, hes just sooooo energetic and has an overabundance in personality that doesn't woo a room. Hes not what I'm looking for, and I shouldn't be what he wants. IF he knows what he wants, b/c he probably doesn't. But, its not like I do. I have writers block. Or maybe I'm just in a wierd mood. I want to fill out one of those profile thingy's. I usually do it for my characters, so I should make one up and do it for my character that I have yet to make up.  Yes, that all made sense to me. I'm in s wierd mood. I saw HP3 today, and I don't think you should go see it. I didn't like it, but I don't know, I was just satisfying my curoisity. (Bad acting and fucked up storyline, need I say more?) I hate you. Isn't amazing how much those three words can change so much? I hate that. It should take more to destroy people. Something more than words that tumble from lips carelessly, thoughtlessly, like the bumbling steps of a toddler.  But no, words can change so much, bring up hope, and make people fall in love, and make people want to die. Its all happened before, and it will all happen again.  Theres so much to say, and not enough people to say it. But you can't say anything that hasn't already been said before, but you can re-word it, turn it aroung even, and all you're doing is making a new thought process to the same goal. I have this bamboo thing on my desk, its got three stalks for happiness, and well, theres not much to say for happiness, becasue, well theres really not much to say about happiness in a world full of suffering, (thats all over too soon.) See, re-word it, flip it, turn it, and what have you got? Bad grammer and a whole lot of caffine pills. Not really.  I wanted to know if the Easter Bunny had made it home yet, but my stick of gum didn't offer any clues so I sat back and watched the firework show, and there was somthing that clicked that night when she rested against me, somthing that put into words would make worthless, so I'll keep away from the viewing public and keep your comments to yourself. I'd like to venture a guess... as to what I donot know, but if its worthwhile, I'll go along.

      Okay, so they weren't that bad, its just the waiting for school to end thats the bad part.  Anyways, I was going to do this b/c I had some reason to, but I can't rememeber it. I need to go check BoA* lyrics b/c in this one song, I swear I hear her say somthing kinda werid. I don't know what it is but I just think that I don't know.  Wow. I'm lazy. And I want to play FFX. Yeah shes says what I thought she said. "Cuz some day, one day, you'll be mine... And make love for the very first Time tonight" Anyways, I didn't think that SM would let them sing stuff like that considering they try to keep the sex appeal away from thier singers, or atleast BoA and DBSK, and I think F2TS, but I'm not sure. I'm not totally onto the kpop scence to know fo' sure. Wow, I'm tired. Well gonna go. See ya later.

      Case and point: Jae Joong, (and maybe Xiah, but hes not as pretty as Jae.)   Anyways, I am tottaly blowing off the need to study for my finals which are tomorrow and friday. I am currently reading fan fics, and trying to figure out who the guys of Shinhwa are, along with trying to figure out a little more about Kang Ta. And Fly To The Sky.  *Sigh* So who can tell what my summers gonna be about? Fanfics, video games, my blog, and stories. YES. It will be thiiiis way and no one will have the mind to stop me and tell me to have a real summmmer. *SIGH* I'm starting to get impatient with this whole summer thing. I wish it would start. I have things to do. Okay, so thats a lie. I actually have nothing to do, but I do have a headache.  Isn't that a really sexy picture of Jae? I think so.

      if its any of your family memebers, you feel like telling them to just fuck off? Yeah, I feel like that right now, and I'm not ashamed of it. Why? B/c they like to play the little "I'm talking to this person but not to you, and I'll talk to this person who has nothing to do with the situation and I'm just gonna act like a dumb shit" game. Yeah, my mom basically invented this game and shes the only one who knows all the rules. I can't even play it. And I  don't  want to play it b/c i have a little more respect for other people and  myself  than that.  *sigh* I really need to write a fanfic. But the thing is, I don't really have an idea for one. Well, I do, and I just guess I want to see how people would like my writing and well, I never write stuff like that, but if its a way to get some of my stuff read, then, yeah, I'll do it for selfish reasons. Don't we all?    *suppressing scream*    I'm really trying, i swear, but sorry boys, you're not working...    working...    almost there...    almosst.....    *sigh*drools* Am i pathetic cuz hot korean guys make me forget the fact that I hate my family? (YES.) Well, I still have to scream and my stomachs upset cuz my mom cooked. Yuck. I want a boyfriend. Or maybe just a friend. Or maybe someone, besides the imaginary you, to listen to me. Who knows? Who cares? (Not the neighbor lady.)

       When she left me, when she really got on that plane, I felt something disappear. I don’t know what it was, maybe a part of myself that I felt she had filled, or perhaps it was just another one of those feelings of misplacing something, and then searching for it until you forget what it was you were searching for in the first place.  I was hoping that I could forget about her, but hoping at the same time that she wouldn’t forget about me.  It’s amazing sometimes, how much you can feel for another person. You can feel for a person more than you feel for yourself, and I guess that’s why love can scare so many people. When you feel for another person, you’re thrusted into so many different emotions and worries that it can cause you to flee. I wish I could have fled her. Then maybe I wouldn’t be standing at the airport, watching her leave for a distant country, thinking that it’s a part of myself that I'm losing.  But I am.  God, I miss her already.
