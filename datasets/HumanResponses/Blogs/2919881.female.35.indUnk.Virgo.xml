      I created this blog in hopes of it being my semi-journal of personal life, to brag about my tots, to share my knitting and other crafty-like adventures, and just to blather about nothing at all.  It is private right now, but I might, someday feel the need to share it with friends/family, not being sure if I will actually make this thing public ever.  Yikes.  Right now, I will be my only audience.  Bravo.  burp.  This was actually started in late 2003, but I am just now created entries.  I'm lazy. xo

      Saw it!  Great piece of film-making, whatever the negative critiques have been (& there are many a fume-age smoldering).  I came out of the theatre fuming myself.  About g.dubbya, that is.  bleeee.  I cannot believe this is the president of our country.  And I will be completely bewildered if that man is re-elected--said the wildly strong, yet sensible democratic gurl.  period.

      from our all-family all-weekend vacation in Harrison Hot Springs, B.C..  Very lovely.  Very fun to have my brother, step-bro & his wife, the folks, kids and M all together vacationing at this spa-like resort in fabulously beautiful Canada!  Warm.  Very warm.  Sunburnt shoulders (ONLY M and myself, NOT the kids.  Lack of sunscreening, neglecting us adults).  Lots of swimming.  Lots of water.  Lots of varying temperatured pools.  Lots of little walks/hikes.  M and Craig (my bro) went jetskiing, which I was surprised that that's what they wanted to do.  whatever.  good food.  one massage.  not bad.

      Well, I started knitting up one sleeve of the gorgeous-looking ' urlLink Gigi ' sweater.  Mine will be in lavender w/ black trimmings.  Well, it  WILL  be someday.  I am finding out how utterly terrible I am at knitting in the round on double-pointed needles.  Yish.  I fear this project will go in my ever growing  very-flawed-pile-o-knitting  pieces.  Oh how I do love the Parisian flavor of this sweater.  I am definitely going through some sort of French-loving-everything stage.  It must be the largish French bits and pieces of my mutt-mixed nationalities coming through.  Au revoir!

        You're an Etch-a-Sketch!!  You're the creative, artsy type who doesn't need to actually utilize a single muscle group in order to have fun. Doesn't matter though, you're still cool.    urlLink   What childhood toy from the 80s are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      It was a bit of an odd day.  Not odd in a bad way.  But odd in the way that my two tots were whisked away on brief notice by their grandfolks to the ocean for 3 days, I had a few hours to myself,  then  M and I had a very legitimate datenight, one in which we didn't feel the urgent need to rush home to the kids out of guilt and what not.  It feels so odd to not have my kids around, BUT quite a nice break (shhh...don't tell anyone!!!) all the same.    Our date-night was to include a darn good meal and a play, but with limited time, we honed in on a rushed, semi-crappy meal (hey, I'm just happy to have been out!  REALLY!) and then to M's sister Katie's current play she's acting in, John Steinbeck's  urlLink 'Travels with Charlie' .  K did a splendidly smashing job in her multi-character role(s)!  The play was wonderful, although I heard the Seattle Weekly gave it mediocre reviews.  Here's a  urlLink good review .  I was getting a bit sleepy near the end of the second act, but was wide awake to greet & talk with K after the play.  Now I get a whole day to myself tomorrow!  Wow!  What to do first?  That is, AFTER I go pill my mom's aging, arthritic cat tomorrow morning.  If only M removes the 1960's original pink toilet from the downstairs bathroom, I will be able to finally texturize and then paint & paper the walls in there.  Yay!  He finally finished the counter (new laminate) and put the sink back in/new faucet's on.  The new john is sitting in the garage and my smoky metallic tiles are waiting to be affixed...and well...wah-la...we  could  possibly have a freshly mini-renovated bathroom by the time the kidlets return!  It's going to look so drastically different.  Cool.

      Well, since I was hoping this would be thee place to blab and blog about my knitting quests, adventures, and mostly mishaps, I FINALLY got around to taking some pictures of some of my knitted items, this habit starting for me back in October 2003, with a brief attempt about a year prior that ended with just a bunch of little squares all over the joint. Missing from photo session are countless scarves, some bags/purses, the SNB poncho, a few hats, 3 started sweaters, many works-in-progress & miscellanea. These are ordered as chronologically as my pea-small brain could recall (that's what I get for NOT taking photos &amp; notes at the time of knitting. blah!  Here we go:  Scarves. Didn't everyone start with scarves? There were tons and tons (most of them were given away as presents, so no photos), but here's just a sample:    one 2-toned, purple 'hairy' (scary) scarf. the middle one came actually much later, a sort of weird attempt at felting wool, with 'fur' inbetween. interesting, to say the most. on the right we have a stripey shagster.     after the countless scarves, came the first hat. kinda ugly with ultra cheap acrylic yarn (2 strands held together, sewn up in back).         my most expensive scarf to date, at approx. $30 for both the yarns. not much compared to the $100-a-pop scarves my mother's neighbor makes, but way pricey to me. for  just  a scarf! this one sparkles and glitters with glam.      first attempt at a something other than scarves and hats....  'tank girl'  in black from the 'Stitch N' Bitch' book. the pattern rawks. my tank top sucks. my first poke at seaming something big, so I went overboard, with horridly stiff results, etc. this now sits on the back of my crafting chair....a sort of failed chair cover, too.          my daughter M in the first summery top I attempted for her. not bad. not great. but wearable. and FAST! a pattern passed onto me by my good gal-pal   urlLink  C    (I seem to be knitting everything this grrl knits, as she's an utter inspiration!).             the second sweater from same pattern a few days later (this was about march/april), this one modified to be more of a fall sweater, with longer sleeves & a raggy-wool-chenilley-like yarn. I like this version much better.          second felted bag, circa march.              from 'SNB' book, this tank I worked on from about march to may (on and off), definately a hate-hate relationship, supposed to be this grand b-day present gesture for my mama that turned to utter hell. the most ill-fitting garment i hope i'll ever knit (and never worse!). needless to say, i made her another tank (different pattern from 'yarn girl's guide') that turned out a shade bit better. at least it was givable as a 'i-made-this-for-you-so-you-can-just-keep-it-in-your-dresser' type of knittable. i need years and years, at least, of practice to be a much better knitter. hmmmm. quite a disaster, this.             don't laugh. these are my own designed scarves that i keep contemplating on trying to sell. one is beaded. one is mohair with an abstract stripey pattern. everything is hard to see on these tiny photos. much more interesting in reality. honest.       two more of my own creations....baby scarves in definite color. unfortunately, you cannot see the patterns in the knits here.             a pile-o my designed beaded, felted flowers, which are eventually intended to end up on my totwhimsy website. someday. i have so many plans, with so little gumption.         another beaded, felted &amp; dyed flower brooch design, which may or may not end up in the scrap heap that's a mile high already. tedious little things.             some yarns i've dyed with kool-aid. some better than others. the dying truly inspired by my dear friend,   urlLink  H   , whom is an amazingly gifted knitter and all-around-creative type, to say the very least! She inspires me in all facets of life. truly! I heart H!                some of my cap designs, knitted in soft cottony fibers, knit flowers to be added later (hopefully), for the adult set.         this is a   urlLink  chicknits    pattern...one of their bucket hats. it's prefelted in this pix, and is huge-o-mongeous! i knit this months ago and it still waits to be felted.            another top i'll never wear in public. it turned out okay. i screwed up the length in the shoulders, which made the end result in the sleeves too poofy, PLUS I ran out of 3 of the colors of yarns, even though I bought as much as the pattern called for (can you see where I improvised? yikes.). it sucked! it actually fits vintage-y, but i would never wear these fruity colors....this was more of a 'I-can-do-that-and-I'll-prove-it-to-ya' project. It's from the 'Vintage Knits' book. lovely patterns. let's hope i'm more sucessful on the other 4 garments i have my eye on and have yarn for (some even in slow-mo progress as I type!), from this delicious book!          from another pattern C e'ed me, and in which she made TWO of these cute little tanks. i love this pattern, but next time, i'm making it larger. so quick! knit with debbie bliss cotton cashmere yarn in purple, sage and slatey gray. this took me two nights and it actually looks good on my daughter! yay! finally.       just freshly finished a few days ago, another pattern from chicknits. it came out kinda huge....sack-like, as i made the unfitted version, and went up a size as i am usually such a tight knitter. it hangs loose on me, but that's ok. i can wear a tee under it. maybe i can play basketball in it? yeah. only thing is i cannot for the life of me knit in the round and then switch to straight needles and do stockinette stitch and get the two parts to look the same! it kills me! i tried everything from loosing my stitch to tightening....it just looks like two very different stitch patterns, when it's not supposed to. ugh. i still kind of dig it....for my knitting, anyways. maybe because i could actually wear this.           this is what is in the works right this second. a very much 'winged' and pieced poncho for M in olivey green with eyelash fringe in a tangier pale green. i hope to post a pix of the finished project someday. i hope this one turns out. i love the way the pattern stitch looks! almost intricate looking, but very simple.           Well, that's all folks....for now. until next year...ha.
