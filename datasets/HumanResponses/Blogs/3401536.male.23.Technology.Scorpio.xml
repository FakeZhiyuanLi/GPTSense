      Thank you for visiting. I have actually had this blog for quite some time now, but never used it quite as much as I should have. Therefore, there will be some catching up to do.  I will include here, what is going on in my life. Anything from personal, business, pleasure, and spiritual. I guess those are the main areas I care about (not in the order).  Feel free to comment or send emails, I'd love to hear from you.  Ciao

      Still jobless, but it has been great not working at PFs. I realized how negative and dark that place is. If any of you have ever worked in the service industry, you know what I am talking about.  In the process of finding a new job, I thought about teaching. While i wasnt expecting to do much, since i dont have any teaching experience or certification, i was just looking to do something in the community where i could pass along some of my computer knowledge. After a couple phone calls and emails, I am now going to teach a computer class at Pikes Peak Community College (PPCC) here in Colorado Springs (SPGS). From the first phone call to the offer, it was about 2 hours. I was completely caught off guard, but am excited.  The class is basic computing and only a 100 level class, but it should be fun. Also, it is on Peterson Air Force Base. I understand that PPCC has a remote location there. And, it will be a bit of a consentrated course. For the four weekends in October, I will be teaching Friday night and all day Saturday. It doesn't bother me too much; the experience will be great.  Ciao

      Well, I just quit my job today. I kind of just walked out at the end of my shift, and I am not going back. I was working at PF Chang's, a Chinese restaurant.  After graduating last May, I thought it would be fun to get a low responsibility job so I could do some traveling because I had sisters in 3 different locations across the world at the time. I also wasn't quite ready for the whole 'career' thing at 22 years old. Therefore, when I moved back to Colorado Springs (SPGS) after graduation, I got a job as a server at PFs. It was fun and did allow me to be flexible with my time and travel. The big trip I took was to Panama to see my sister Patricia. (That was a great time, maybe I will post on it later.) Anywho, I got tired of waiting tables. I think I felt like I should be doing so much more.  So, without any other plans, I quit my job and now am looking to do something with my degree: B.A. in Computer Information Systems.  Ciao

      My old housemate Josh Bean has been offered a contract job in Astan and he took it.  He is keeping up a  urlLink blog  as well, I would encourage you to check up on him if you know him. It is a great opportunity for him to travel, and get paid very well to do it. I thought about applying for a similar job, but realized I had a lot here in the SPGS. Things like getting involved in ministry, teaching college, a few things like that.  I would love to travel in the future, but now God has me here, so I will wait.  Ciao

      Still no job.  Since quitting my job and having all this free time, I have spent more and more time at my church,  urlLink New Life . I had been going to  urlLink theMILL  (college/20-something) group on Friday nights for about a year now, and I was going to Sunday morning service with my mom. We have a  urlLink SATURDAYNIGHT  service too, but I was always working at PFs cause that's a big money night.    [Flash back to first year of college, Christmas break]      I was sitting in a coffee shop here in the SPGS and felt God tell me I would be involved in youth ministry. I consulted with my youth pastor, and he encouraged me to finish college, then pursue it. So I did...        Now that I had some free time, I thought it would be a great time to pursue that. I talked with people in the college group and in the high school group ( urlLink _tag ), and completely felt God directing me to the high schoolers. I met with Jeremiah, the youth leader, and we had a great time fellowshiping. He told me about what was coming up with the _tag and I shared was God had put on my heart. It was very exciting; we were both pumped about me getting involved. The plan now is that I will co-lead a co-ed high school small group coming up in the fall. The groups will meet once a week and coincide with the school year, so in August or September I will be ministering to some young high school kids. I can't wait!  Ciao

      Over the last 24 hours I have had two thoughts. Okay, more than two, but two worth mentioning.  1. The first of which I had while laying in bed last night. With this new blog craze that  urlLink Josh  and I have joined got me thinking.  Why are weblogs so popular?  I think it goes back to our human need for contact. I know it sounds counter intuitive, but here me out. We (as humans) long for contact, acceptance, etc from other humans. It is one of our basic needs. Since we have become a very closed off society and technology driven, the blog has become an outlet for this. If I may be a little open and frank with you, I think it is more prevalent among men. It gives us a way to open up like we would like to, without feeling too vulnerable. So, opening up to the WORLD seems more acceptable than opening up to the people that are closest to us ... Interesting. Just something to think about.  2. People should be required to get an internet/computer license like a drivers license. Too many people use the internet, email, and technology without proper knowledge of it. I think that might be the reason viruses are spread so easily. People are not educated to know what is, or possibly is, a virus/hoax so they get click happy. Or the opposite: they are afraid to close anything thinking it will never come back. Sorry, just had to get that off my chest. While I am talking about drivers licenses, they should make those tests harder. There are too many people out on the roads that should not be. They are oblivious to everything going on around them ... their blinker that is still on, the fact they are in the passing lane without passing, and stopping when there is a green arrow telling you to go, Go,  GO!   If you would like to learn more about email, internet, computers, or driving, feel free to email me... if you can figure out how to do that. :)

      Because of the recent free time on my hands, and the fact that I did not post anything relevant for the past ... well ever, I am going to do some catching up.  The posts that follow will contain experiences and happens from the past year or so that are important to me, or entertaining to you (hopefully).  I will try to keep them separated by topic so it doesn't get too confusing, and if you don't want to hear about a particular topic you can skip it.  Ciao
