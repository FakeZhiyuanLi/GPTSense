      at the minute, i have straight hair.  i've been struck by the extent to which people notice/are affected by what one looks like.  i've had so many comments in the last couple of days about my hair or general appearance, and 99% of them have been positive.  but it makes me wonder...is it just the difference that makes people comment?  or do i genuinely look so yucky normally that any change is a good change?  i refuse to believe that!    it is odd though - have come to the conclusion that people are weird!

      there's something about bank holidays...the unexpected pleasure of having a day off randomly, for no apparent reason.  they always seem to sneak up on me, catch me unawares, with no plans or schemes.  yesterday was one such day.  i lazed delightfully for a considerable portion of the day.  watched snippets of  urlLink  bugsy malone   and  urlLink  huckleberry finn  ...faffed and read and was inducted into blogdom.  the day seemed endless.  but today, it was back to porridge.  and that's just the way it is.

      ok, i've finally had my arm twisted by  urlLink my sister  enough to make me start a blog.  and it's so much fun!  have just spent the past hour or so faffing about with html - i can forsee that this new venture will provide me with hours of endless amusement...  so anyway, this is my blog.  the beginning of something special?  we'll just have to wait and see...

      while i was at church yesterday, i had what might become a v. important realisation.  i was looking at people who i remember as young people in the church who are now married and coming with their children, and i thought "i don't want that to be me!"  i don't want to be the parent who takes their child to the open day at their old school and remembers all the teachers.  i don't want to be going to church in my late 20s/early 30s and still have people refusing to belive that i've grown up and still thinking that i'm 16.  i don't want to live in carrick for the rest of my life!  the only problem now is that while i know what i don't want, i'm not really sure what i  do  want!  i'm just praying now that the year in new zealand will be a time when i can really discover what God's plan for me is.  i think i've been avoiding seeking God's will for the past couple of years because i've been scared to move on.  it's easier to drift into things and stay there for lack of anything better than to actively seek something different.  but i think it's time for a change...

      today i've been mostly working mucho amounts of overtime and watching  urlLink this film  with my mum and a wee glass of wine.  esther may mock me, but there's nothing like that warm, snuggly feeling you get inside after watching a really good rom-com, cheesy or not.  in fact, bring on the gouda!

      sometimes i really hate technology.  usually when i'm in the middle of generating a huge list at work and my computer freezes.  or the internet goes down just as i've  almost  finished downloading something.  but today, it's the comment on my blog.  it's not working dammit!  and i cannot find anywhere else to sign up for comments!  am v irritated...if you know of anywhere else that's accepting signups please let me know.  oh yes, that's right, you can't!  the comments aren't working!  am also officially freaked out by two of the biggest spiders in the world ever (TM).  i'm very thankful for dad, who is willing to capture said spiders in jars and remove them while his daughter is curled up on the sofa shrieking.  am just praying that future housemates are good with arachnids - i think i will make it a requirement of residence...must be willing to catch spiders if required.

      i played snood the other day for the first time in absolutely ages.  it took me back, took me way back, to the days before rock and roll...well, not quite, but to the days when the computer was somewhere else - days when we downloaded songs and listened for hours - days when i didn't like jewel (which seems unthinkable now).  and it makes me ponder on how slowly and quickly changes come.  suddenly and incrementally.  i'm not a student anymore.  my sister is married.  i weigh less than i did in january.  i've discovered  urlLink books  that i didn't even know existed this time last year.  but i'm still me.  me...

      i visted my own blog through a link from  urlLink esther's  last week, and realised it has been a shockingly long time since i have blogged.  so long, in fact, that i had forgotten my password and couldn't get in to write anything!  that is now fixed (obviously), but sadly the inspired mood has gone off me.  so will just type mundanely about nothing in particular instead...  am listening to a cd of a concert of a choir i was in at university this afternoon.  it amazes me that, although it's been almost 3 years, and i haven't listened to the cd in months (or longer), i still remember the words, and all my parts, to every song.  i guess it brings home the power of music again, that it can just burrow into your brain, and stay there seemingly forever.    in work this week we were talking about music, and how certain songs are so deeply connected to certain times of your life or certain experiences that when you hear them you are right back there again.  sometimes this is good, and sometimes less so.  i wonder will i ever be able to sing 'be thou my vision' again without thinking about my grandma's funeral - and would it be so bad if i do?  because that way i will never forget her...even if i would rather remember her life than the ceremonials associated with her passing.  i do not think her life will go unremembered, though...

      it snowed today...proper powdery, squeak-when-you-walk-on-it snow.  there is nothing like the pleasure of walking on a virgin stretch of snow, knowing that no one has walked there before, and that whoever comes after you will be walking in your footsteps.  such fun!

      i have never been the master of the well-chosen phrase.  i often feel i should carry a thesaurus around with me to help me pinpoint the words that regularly escape my grasp.  (in fact, some of my friends are pretty good substitutes, able to fill in my "whatevers" and "thingumajigs" with ease.)  i think instead, my gift lies in absorbing other people's words.  my memory seems to have an almost boundless capacity for retaining books i have read, films i've seen, songs i've heard and sung, snatches of poems...sometimes i swim in a sea of words not my own, able to see and touch but not able to turn them to my own ends.  which is really a long-winded way of saying "this is why i do not blog very often".

      i have been thinking about this a lot recently, and took the opportunity of an email discussion with a friend to put my thoughts into words...  "sorry, am not ignoring you!  have just been marshalling my thoughts before responding…  I actually think this film could be a quite a good thing.  hopefully it will bring home to people who watch it the sheer horror and violence and cruelty of jesus’ death, and help them to realise exactly what it was that jesus did for them on the cross.  I think we (certainly in the modern, western world) have been guilty of sanitising the events of the bible so they are no longer as striking and effective and immediate as they really should be.  I do see your point about the adulation of the actors instead of jesus.  however, I think the fact that most of the actors are italian, and therefore largely unknown world-wide will help that not to happen.  even the main guy who’s playing jesus is not really that famous.  it would be different if you had tom cruise playing jesus!  also, it’s in aramaic and latin, so essentially a foreign language film.  and I don’t think (from what I have read) that it seeks to glamourise the story in any way.  as far as I can tell, mel gibson seems to have a real passion (sorry, no pun intended!) for this project and has undertaken it with sincerity (as has his leading man) and a real desire to bring the story of the passion to the masses (so to speak) in a way they are more likely to respond to (since we live in such a visual age).  having said that, I am still unsure as to whether I will watch this film.  I feel I should, but I am not sure whether I could cope with watching the realities of the crucifixion (as mel gibson sees it) – how wimpy am I?  it’s a bit like schindler’s list fr me I think – I still have not watched this, though I feel I should and would like to one day.  but have never been ‘in the mood’ so to speak, since I don’t really think it’s a film I would watch for entertainment value, if you know what I mean.  *phew*  well, those are my thoughts!  hope you don’t regret asking me now!"

      i feel i may be a hoarder.  this is a realisation i have been trying to avoid for the past few months, but sadly i can no longer hide the truth.  perhaps i should have felt this encroaching when i discovered that i had birthday cards from my grampy who died in 1994.  but i figured, "well, i kept them for sentimental reasons, so it doesn't really count".  or the fact that a box of cards/photos/bits and bobs that were the main decoration of my room in my third year of uni lie undisturbed in the top of my wardrobe.  no, it seems that, to quote an old cliche, denial ain't just a river in egypt.  i am a hoarder, and it was finding all my travel documents, tickets, leaflets and other miscellany from a trip i took to new zealand almost 4 years ago that made me realise it.    i wonder is there some kind of 12 step programme for rehabilitation?  step 1 - admit the truth.  step 2 - revisit all hoardings (is that even a word?).  step 3 - laugh (and sometimes cry) over the memories.  step 4 - cough as a result of the dust disturbed.  step 5 - procrastinate (perhaps by blogging).  step 6 - sort half-heartedly.  step 7 - procrastinate some more (it must be time for a refreshing beverage by now).  step 8 - decide you really  do  need to keep that card/letter/receipt from 1992 (delete as appropriate).  step 9 - sort again.  step 10 - begin to actually (shock! horror!) get rid of some stuff.  remember, it's always good to start slow.  old cinema tickets hurt less than photographs.  step 11 - take a fit of the head-staggers and get rid of everything you don't want/need/remember what it was/was used for.  step 12 - put all that's left into a shoebox to save for the next time.  result - hoarding problem is dealt with!    i feel it may be time for a refreshing beverage...

      it's been pretending to be summer around here lately.  but just as i was lulled into a false sense of security (i even got sunburned at the weekend, for heaven's sake!), the weather has been really sneaky and blown cold again...  i wonder what it is in the genetic make-up of the irish/british that leads us to talk about the weather like it has a personality.  in fact, what leads us to talk about the weather at all?  is weather actually defined as the changes in general climatic outlook, rather than outlook itself?  is this why weather is such an integral facet of british life, because it is so changeable?  how much can one define a nation by its attitude to the weather anyway?   in other news, why are my feet always so much dirtier in the summer than at any other time of year?  also, why am i asking so many questions today?  it is not normal for a wednesday at all...i think i should step away from the computer before i begin to question the very nature of existence itself, and cause myself untold psychological problems in later life!

      as  urlLink esther  has thrown down the gauntlet, i'm dipping my toes back in the water of blogdom once again...  sitting in the garden at lunchtime today, the sun warm on my face, my vision somewhat blurred (i had taken my specs off in an attempt to avoid the panda eye effect), i realised how little it takes to make me happy.  a  urlLink good book ...a walk along the seashore on a sunny day...a coffee frappuccino from starbucks...music for every mood...diet coke on a hot day (or any day!)  and despite all that has happened in the past year, the sadness, loneliness,  tears (and laughter too), uncertainty, anticipation, sometimes even disillusionment, i realise that i am, in the words of semisonic, feeling strangely fine.

      i feel like a wet dishrag which has been wrung out after being used to mop up a large spillage...  every year, tim takes me for a ride on the henman rollercoaster.  every year, i keep coming back for more.  it's not even as if i'm really what you would call a hardcore sporting fan.  but tennis, and wimbledon in particular, always seem to have the ability to suck me right in.  add tim henman to the mix, and it's almost too much for my nerves to take!  but he is  urlLink through to the quarter-final  (again), so optimism can reign for a little longer.

      “If only there could be an invention,” I said impulsively, “that bottled up a memory, like scent.  And it never faded, and it never got stale.  And then, when we wanted it, the bottle could be uncorked, and it would be like living the moment all over again.”   urlLink  Rebecca , by Daphne du Maurier   I never cease to be amazed by how much memory can be stored up in such small things.  Turning over the pages of A-level notes, I am transported back into the classroom.  Parquet floors, broken blinds, desks that rock unevenly when you lean on them.  Discussions of poetry, diatribes about grammar, giggles regarding mispronunciations.  Practice exam questions, essays, ‘compare and contrast’.  Friendship.  Study.  Youth.  Enthusiasm.  And yet, no matter how clear the memory, it is never the same as the moment remembered.  A layer of Perspex, time solidified, has been imposed between now and then.  A film without sound, a picture without scent.  Even the happiest memories are somewhat dimmed, sepia tinted like old newspapers.  Still, memory, even faded and pale, is immeasurably precious…

      i've been up since 5 this morning, and am somehow surviving on approx. 2 1/2 hours sleep.&nbsp; i think i'm running on adrenaline really...   we arrived in cambridge early this morning, walked through the grafton centre before the shops were even open.&nbsp; it's very weird having been up for so many hours - by the time 9 o'clock came it felt like lunchtime.&nbsp; we were in 3 starbucks in as many hours, on the hunt for frappuccinos (success came in the final one, thankfully!).&nbsp; walking through the streets i felt i had double vision - times past were imprinted on today.&nbsp; i still got shivers walking up to the senate house, even though i got my final exam results a long time ago!  and now we're in cherry hinton, at the folk festival.&nbsp; the tent's safely up after only a few minor mishaps, and we've been walking round soaking in the atmosphere.&nbsp; there are so many food stalls here - almost every cuisine you can think of is represented.&nbsp;   i'm surrounded by the smell of summer - suncream, sweat, sunshine on canvas.&nbsp; takes me back, takes me way back, to the days of postboxes hidden in rotten tree-stumps, sliding down the dunes, listening to night-jars in the forest...back to the days when leggings and slouch socks were acceptable travelling attire, and going to get water from the tap became an adventure.  we haven't even heard any music yet, and i'm already excited!

      today i was an observer in a half-familiar city, moving on the periphery, passing the girl in the pink poncho again and again.  people rushed past - i dawdled. they had places to be while i enjoyed the now. browsing in shops, sipping coffee urlLink  , enjoying the simple pleasures of a week day with no work.  and now i'm home, back in my own place, fitting into the accustomed groove again. though tomorrow holds the unusual delights of daytime tv and rotw planning, much more pleasant to look forward to than the daily grind...  pee ess - am so incredibly peed off with my digital camera it's almost not true. thank heaven for the calming influence of the be good tanyas...

      i have just finished reading  urlLink the catalpa tree , and i feel like i have been steamrollered by love and loss and grief and longing.  i have not been this emotionally engaged in, and affected by, a book since i finished reading  urlLink i capture the castle ...and looking back, that was at easter.  i wonder what i have been reading since then that has left me so relatively unmoved, so shallowly involved that i can put down the book and move on with my life.  now, i feel like jude and oliver will be with me for days, lurking in the background of my consciousness, almost more real than my colleagues and my family.  three years ago while i was reading  urlLink fire and hemlock , my life passed in a blur.  i caught the train, moved through the office, answered phones, ate my lunch, almost unaware of the real world, completely engaged in polly's twin worlds of middleton and nowhere.  i am still amazed, and awed, by the power that words can exert.  simple shapes on a page bring to life whole worlds, people, places, fresh every time the book is opened.  with enough skill, we can be made to feel their pain, laugh when they laugh, love as they do.  and it never ceases to amaze me that  urlLink i capture the castle  was written by the same author as  urlLink the hundred and one dalmatians .
