      today was racial harmony celebration... :) went to school really early today... cos bus leaves at 7am for performers and reporters (which i am one)... oh yeah... my mum bought some chinese traditional clothing... :) it's a bit too big but looks nice enough... costs $9.90 only leiz... :P well so from school go chinese high... first thing was the malay dance for the chinese high sec 4... and it wasn't very good... the performers were quite ill-prepared... so stayed back to watch again... and yeah&nbsp;the second time was better... after that wanting, shaun, gab and me went to "stalk" the guest-of-honour... haha... gosh i never lost sight of Dr Vivian Balakrishnan from the time he stepped out of the car to the time he got back in... haha... so jason (photographer) and i followed him first to the silat & wushu display, then to the malay wedding ceremony, then to the batik painting stall, and then on to the auditorium where i saw the malay dance for the third time! :P but the third time was even&nbsp;better than the second... then afterwards jason and me followed Dr Vivian Balaknishnan to the refreshments area where he talked with several students from CHS, WSSS and HJC... then after that he started to make his leave... but just before he stepped into the car i interviewed him haha... :P well then after that go home... but i managed to have spoken with alot of the important personel involved in the celebrations though... so it was really satisfying... phew... tough day!

      hey... today was exciting... :) today bio lesson mrs chua took the class around the school compound to view flowers... and that murderer also rip the flowers and tear them to pieces and throw them away... haha... really... :P some more say she got license (to kill)... well mrs chong didn't come today so mr khoo took over... and after that ms lim took over for e.maths... she so unreasonable... too used to lower sec class i think... well nvm abt her... then later a very nice thing happened... gab and me were walking home from the bus-stop and we saw a nice-looking cute cat below a HDB flat... it was so cute and friendly... :D but it was skinny and hungry... so gab stayed with the cat while i went 7-eleven buy cat food... :P in the rain some more leiz... then i went back and open the can and the cat started to eat it ravenously... then gab and i left it alone and went back... hope the cat's still alrite now... :) oh yeah... thought of a "chim" english sentence today... hope it makes enough sense - His mellifluous yet infinitesimally sinister voice was the epitome of deceptivity, easily beguiling the simple-minded.  tada... yeah... that's just cool... :D
