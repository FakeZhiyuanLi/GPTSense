      I see it everywhere.  From the Polyphonic Spree’s kazoo and sunshine choral anthems to nightclubs being outfitted with sanctuaries for Tibetan monks, the boys and girls of today are quietly becoming the most spiritual Americans since the Love Children of 1969.  Unlike our hippy-dippy parents, or more to the fact, because of them, the new spiritual heart of America isn’t a surface dance of flowers, pot and “happenings”.  Sure, we have Burning Man, but unlike the flame-out of Woodstock, the playa “annual community” has been going on for sixteen strong years now.  Sure we smoke pot, that’s why we have coalitions lobbying for its legislation and we’ve once again reclaimed “happening” as a verb, freeing our minds by releasing the pause button of post-modernism and starting to live once again.  At my brother’s graduation ceremony, a U.S. Representative got up and spoke. What he said was acidulously thought out for an election year, but rang true regardless.  The essential gist was: “The world you are entering is a mess.  There is no legacy for you to take up the mantle of that has not been tarnished beyond repair.  The Earth is polluted in every way you can imagine and the nation you hope to better has deferred its problems by betting on the future- which you will pay for.”   Pretty depressing stuff, right?  Wrong.  A world undone is a world reborn.  How do I know, you ask?  It’s in the Bible.  Transfiguration need not be only for saints and Messiah’s.  Why not the Earth?  Why not the country?  Why not me?  On every level, there’s been suffering and there’s been death; we all know what’s supposed to come next…

      I'm a musical kind of guy.The first play I ever wrote that I really liked was "Called Sonata For Three Women in Labor".  If I'm travelling, it's with headphones.  I dig music.  It's, ya know, inspiring. It's very easy for me to visualize music and apply those images to whatever it is I'm working on.    With that in mind, here's my    Highway Pilgrim Playlist    Stairway to Heaven- Dolly Parton   Nobody knows what the hell Led Zepplin is singing about in this classic, but Dolly's got an idea that with some added lyrics and a 100 strong gospel choir backing her up, she might put some Holy Rolling into this song.  Let me repeat: Dolly Parton covers Led Zepplin...with a gospel choir. An achievment on the scale of the launching of the Titanic or the final flight of the Hindenberg. You can't look away.   We Won't Need Legs to Stand- Sufjan Stevens   Sufjan Stevens is the spiritual heir of Nick Drake and Elliot Smith, which is reason enough to listen to him.  His latest album,  Seven Swans , as the  Village Voice  puts it, will cause "bespectacled youth sporting unfunny "Jesus is my Homeboy" t-shirts to get pink-faced at the (pointedly non-ironic) subtexts." Since "Jesus is my Homeboy" t-shirt wearers are an intended audience of Highway Pilgrim, Sufjan's music is so close to home it's frightening.   Flight Attendent- Josh Rouse   While there's a passing reference to growing up in "the Bible Belt", the appeal of this song is that it's so frank and honest.  It's about a "pretty boy" whose teased in his Middle of Nowhere town and dreams/becomes a champagne swiller in a first class seat on airplane flying far above his old life.  It captures both the differences between "coastal culture" and "heartland culture", but also points out that those big shot celebrities we all hate for being so glamorous often started out in a crappy little Bible-thumping town.     Hallelujah- Jeff Buckley   Oh, I know- this song falls under the slightly heretical category of Songs-That-Imply-My-Girlfriend-Might-Be-My-Lord-and-Savior, but who cares?  This song is great if only for the chord change on "the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major fifth".  Damien Rice also does a great cover.   Drop Kick Me Jesus- Gavin Bryce   I swear to God, in High School I was roped into creating the "Farewell Video" for our school's departing Computer Lab teacher, Mrs. Pitts.  It turned out that Drop Kick Me Jesus was her favorite song, and so I found myself combining farewell wishes from the Principal with lyrics like "Drop kick me Jesus through the goalposts of life...".  Really, I'm not making this up.  Incidentally, we called the Computer Lab "The Pitts Stop".  After she left and a new computer lab teacher was found, they eventually found a new name for the lab that reflect our new teacher, "The Trehan Station".

      Hi there.  My name is Japhy Grant and I'm the director of Highway Pilgrim, a documentary that will take my crew, myself- and through this website- YOU, across the country in search of a little known celebrity named God.  Travelling to some of America's most unique Christian roadside attractions, we'll be shooting a man in Indiana who uses macaws and parrots to tell Bible stories, a museum in Texas that claims man and dinosaur lived together, a depiction of the Ten Commandments so large you can see it from space and much more.  The Highway Pilgrim Online Journal (you're at it), will allow you, dear reader, to keep up with us as we criss-cross the nation.  I've made my crew promise to write to you all (It's either that or enforced Bible Study), so as we prepare to depart and all throughout our trip, check back here for the latest.  Since Ryan aka Meeker didn't introduce himself in his entry below- I will.  He's the executive producer of Highway Pilgrim and like Ronald McDonald, he believes in magic.  Well, I'm busy creating a final schedule of events and other logistics, but we'll talk again soon!  -J
