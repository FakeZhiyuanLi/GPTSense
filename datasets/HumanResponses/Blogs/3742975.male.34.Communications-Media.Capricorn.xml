      Who makes this stuff up? Did we really need a movie like this? This movie is bad. First off, let me say dodgeball is a dangerous sport that should be outlawed. Before I went to see this movie I helped my poor neighbor's kid Jake who suffers SBNTS (Super Bad Nervous Twitching Disorder) due to a tragic bike accident (but that's another story). Jakey-a-do, as I like to call him, told me he heard from his father that the movie Dodgeball was a very funny movie that I should see. Then he told me that he was dying, and in five days he would be dead. I couldn't believe it, Jake-a-do dying?  "Please take me to see Dodgeball Uncle Jeremy." We're not related. How could I refuse. The movie opened with two gym owners Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn)and White Goodman (Ben Stiller), driving a Ford SUV in downtown Dallas very fast. They pass car after car and suddendly they hit and run over a wild cheetah that escapes from the local petting zoo. The SUV comes to a full stop and the two get out to see the dead cheetah. White Goodman (Ben Stiller), picks up the cat's head and says to Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn), "Hey let's use this cheetah's head to make the ultimate dodgeball." Next the two men are cross-country skiing to the South Pole Research lab to make the dodgeball. At the lab the two are told that the lab is for researchers only and they were not allowed to enter the building. What happens next can only be described as very amazing. The two men kung-fu fight and graphically kill everyone in the lab. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, Jake-a-do just laughed (and twitched too). When they had killed everyone there they take out the cheetah head and suddendly the it talked. Legeary screen actress Glenn Close provide the voice of Moka the Decapitated Cheetah Head of All Wisdom and Good Fortune. Moka tells White to hold her above his head and face her towards the dead researchers. Moka lets out a scary meow and then laser beams shoots out her eyes and the entire research lab lights up in a beautiful blue glow and her head transforms in to a dodgeball.  I thought I seen it all. They take the ball,head back to St. Louis and go to a local orphanage to play the school's worst players to a game of dodgeball. At this point the voice of Moka speaks out to White and Peter, "Never give up the dream of the fire that burns into the deepest reaches of life. We are all in the fury of time's beating drum...Now win one for me." The beat the school's team in less then 15 seconds and then the dodgeball bounced on the ground and turned in to the Cheetah, but now it had wings and could fly. I don't know what the directors of this film were trying to say, other than drive real careful and if you hit an escaped cheetah you might get a chance to watch it turn back into a cheetah slash bird thing. Jake loved the film, but I guess when your dying you love pretty much everything you look at. As for me, I really wished they hadn't made this movie. On a scale of 1 to 10, I have to give Dodgeball a two.

      Greetings fellow movie lovers. Todays review:  Directed by Michael Moore, whose weight of at least 350lbs has grown to be a favorite of panty-waste world-wide since the 2003 Academy Awards, Fahrenheit 9/11, like Moore's Bowling For Columbine and Roger & Me, promises to give those idiots who can't do anything but complain about how much their lives suck, this movie gives them their Election 2004 marching orders. Fahrenheit 9/11's Cannes Film Festival debut marked the first time a propganda piece has been included among the festival's main competition.  I saw this movie today and let me tell you it should have been called "Fahrenheit Borefest" When the film first starts everyone there who were so excited to see what all the talk was about were quickly puzzled. This movie opens with Michael Moore eating a hot dog, at least 1 minute of him putting ketchup and onions all over the dog. Then he just stares at it for 10 F-ing minutes while the sounds of bag-pipes play some weird song I've never heard. All of a sudden the song stops and he slowly raises his head and he sings David Bowie's Let's Dance. That kind of lightened the mood and put a smile on the faces around, and damn, that guy can sing! After the song the shot cuts to the outside of a car wash and we see Moore pouring gasoline all over a small dog and setting it on fire, then by movie magic the dog, still on fire, talks and makes his plea, "Please vote for John Kerry, he is a good man and he love balloons." The dog dies right after that and the words, "Vote Bush Out. He hates Jake. And so does children. Die Jake!" The movie ended and then at that moment it was all clear why everyone loves this film. Everyone hates Bush and Jake. But for me, I like Jake, he's funny and makes so good music. I also like Bush so I have to say this is a terrible film. A moive that preaches such hate can't be good. When the movie was over I noticed that a young girl was crying quietly and saying, "I love Jake, and now I hate Michael Moore!"  I give this turkey one star. Save your money and go buy a book, something with a lot of action, because everyone needs a little action in their lives.
