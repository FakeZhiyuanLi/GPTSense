         I was barely sitting down when I heard a voice from the other stall saying: "Hi, how are you?"   I'm not the type to start a conversation in the men's restrooms at a rest stop but, I don't know what got into me, so I answered, somewhat embarrassedly: "Doin Just Fine!"   And the other guy says: "So what are you up too?"   What kind of question is that? At that point, I'm thinking this is too bizarre so I say: "Uhhh I'm like you, just traveling east!"   At this point I am just trying to get out as fast as I can when I hear another question.   Can I come over to your place after while?   Ok, this question is just wacky but i figured I could just be polite and end the conversation.   I tell h! im, "Well, I have company over so today is a bad day for me!"   Then I hear the guy say nervously...         "LISTEN"     I'll have to call you back, there's an idiot in the other stall who keeps answering all my questions,

      did you know.... If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days you would have produced enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee.   (Hardly seems worth it.)   If you farted consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb.   (Now that's more like it!)    The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body to squirt blood 30 feet.   (O.M.G.!)    A pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes.   (In my next life, I want to be a pig.)    A cockroach will live nine days without its head before it starves to death. (Creepy.)   (I'm still not over the pig.)     Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour.   (Do not try this at home...... maybe at work.)     The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off.   ("Honey, I'm home. What the....?!")     The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a human jumping the length of a football field.   (30 minutes... lucky pig... can you imagine??)     The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds.   (What could be so tasty on the bottom of a pond?)       Some lions mate over 50 times a day.   (I still want to be a pig in my next life...quality over quantity)     Butterflies taste with their feet.   (Something I always wanted to know.)     The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.   (Hmmmmmm........)     Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people.   (If you're ambidextrous, do you split the difference?)     Elephants are the only animals that cannot jump.   (OK, so that would be a good thing....)     A cat's urine glows under a black light.   (I wonder who was paid to figure that out?)     An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.   (I know some people like that.)     Starfish have no brains.   (I know some people like that too.)       Polar bears are left-handed.   (If they switch, they'll live a lot longer.)     Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure.   (What about that pig??)     Now that you've smiled at least once, it's your turn to spread the stupidity and send this to someone you want to bring a smile to (maybe even a chuckle)...in other words send it to everyone

       Interesting Facts:  1) Why do dimes, quarters and half dollars have notched edges, while pennies and nickels do not? The US Mint began putting notches on the edges of coins containing gold and silver to discourage holders from shaving off small quantities of the precious metals. Dimes, quarters and half dollars are notched because they used to contain silver. Pennies and nickels aren't notched because the metals they contain are not valuable enough to shave.   2) Why do men's clothes have buttons on the right while women's clothes have buttons on the left? When buttons were invented, they were very expensive and worn primarily by the rich because wealthy women were dressed by maids, dressmakers put the buttons on the maid's right. Since most people are right-handed, it is easier to push buttons on the right through holes on the left. And that's where women's buttons have remained.   3) Why do Xs at the end of a letter signify kisses? In the Middle Ages, when many people were unable to read or write. Documents were often signed using an X. Kissing the X represented an oath to fulfill obligations specified in the document. The X and the kiss eventually became synonymous.   4) Why is shifting responsibility to someone else called "passing the buck"? In card games, it was once customary to pass an item, called a buck, from player to player to indicate whose turn it was to deal. If a player did not wish to assume the responsibility, he would pass the buck" to the next player.   5) Why do people clink their glasses before drinking a toast? It used to be common for someone to try to kill an enemy by offering him a poisoned drink. To prove to a guest that a drink was safe, it became customary for a guest to pour a small amount of his drink into the glass of the host. Both men would drink it simultaneously. When a guest trusted his host, he would then touch -- or clink -- the host's glass with his own.   6) Why are people in the public eye said to be "in the limelight"? Invented in 1825, limelight was used in lighthouses and stage lighting by burning a cylinder of lime in an ox hydrogen flame that produced a brilliant light. In the theater, performers on stage in the ''limelight" were seen by the audience to be the center of attention.   7) Why do ships and aircraft in trouble use "mayday" as their call for help? This comes from the French word m'aidez - meaning "help me" - and is pronounced "mayday." (Note: not exactly.... it's pronounced "med-ay", but close enough)   8) Why is someone who is feeling great "on cloud nine"? Types of clouds are numbered according to the altitudes they attain, with nine being the highest cloud. If someone is said to be on cloud nine, that person is floating well above worldly cares.   9) Why are zero scores in tennis called "love"? In France, where tennis first became popular, a big, round zero on the scoreboard looked like an egg and was called l'oeuf, which is French for "egg". When tennis was introduced in the US, Americans pronounced it "love,"   10) Why are many coin banks shaped like pigs? Long ago, dishes and cookware in Europe were made of a dense, orange clay called pygg. When people saved coins in jars made of this clay, the jars became know as "piggy banks" When an English potter misunderstood the word, he made a bank that resembled a pig. And it caught on here!
