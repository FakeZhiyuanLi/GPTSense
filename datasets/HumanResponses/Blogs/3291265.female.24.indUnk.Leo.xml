      if i were a normal person i could just write that one word and sum my feelings up right now. but since i'm me that means that more than likely too many words are going to be used. and i know it gets on some people's nerves but that's me. i've been a talker since i learned how. i wonder if i went back to being a baby again would i grow up the same? would things be the same? better? worse? (if that's even possible) i don't know. i do know that i let my brain be consumed with things that matter not. i should be in bed sleeping right now but i can't stop the thought process. i just want to be held right now. murray is curled up on my leg but it's just not moving me. i need to change discs i think this far disc is just making me more blah feeling. and what plays next? texas is the reason..not going to help either. goddamn when did i lose the art of being tough? i don't even think i can act tough anymore. my emotions have taken over my life these days. i don't like it. maybe mom is right and i'm just in need of some attention. and not like oh you made a joke let me laugh at you attention or hey let's go makeout and never talk again attention. some romantic let's cuddle and watch a movie then go to bed together kind of attention.  sorry this isn't more amusing or entertaining but i'm just feeling kinda ugh currently. i'm going to try and find some cds that won't make matters worse.  night.

      waiting on my towels to finish drying i decided to list all of my tattoos in the order i got them. it took a lot longer then it probably should have and had to ask erin a few times if this one or that one came first. if you count up all of my tattoos including cover ups i have 21 tattoos. sweet jesus. that means i need to get 3 on my birthday so i can start just getting one a year. that won't happen for a couple reasons but it'd be fun to get 3 for my birthday :)

      haven't heard from carrie yet so who knows if i'm going out tonight or not. at this point i wouldn't be too upset if i didn't. i haven't heard from sam in a few days, i'm waiting to see if he actually calls me, i'm sick of feeling like i'm in charge of the friendship. carolyn is having a get-together saturday so i'll be going over there pretty damn early to help clean the basement and make mashed potatoes. cause i can't fuck with the ones out of the box.

      well sometimes i can do things right. i started my computer this morning and some error message popped up and i couldn't connect to the internet or anything, i restarted it to see if that would help and i got the same message...so i thought for a second and ran ad-aware and *poof* my computer works and no error message =) my nose is peeling damn sun. i should be staying home tonight, i plan on that anyhow. but as usual if something comes up i'll be going out. i can feel myself getting sick and that's not good. we sat outside at buffalo's last night so the smoke wasn't that bad but somehow it always manages to go right across my face no matter how they hold it. time to start laundry.

      but maybe they should be. i've got sam requesting some of my big ass chocolate chunk cookies and glenn wants some brownies. just made erin a pie, i really wish i could do this for a living. one of these days i will. it's the only thing i am good at that i enjoy. i need to start looking for a school again, maybe i can find one close that will let me take a dog. that'd kick so much ass.

      so i left thinking andy wouldn't be there tonight, i thought wrong. a couple hours after i got there he comes walking in. i just ignored him, then he came over and wanted to be all friendly, of course he doesn't know i know that he's talking shit about me but still, funny he's calling me the two faced one. so i helped take some stuff down for beer pong, gave melissa the shoes carrie left in my car last night and came home. carrie knows more then she'll tell me and that bothers me because it's not like she'd be spreading rumours about someone else, she's telling me something that apparently i've done and am unaware of. i give up. i should have just taken robbie smith up on his offer to hang out at mcguire's and play fooseball. i'm going to be seperating myself from people again, i can feel it. i'm just not good at dealing with shit like this.

      i'm so fucking tired right now. how can you feel hungover when you're not doing any drinking? everything is achey and my voice is all blech. can't wait to see what i sound like tomorrow morning. because tonight is going to be yet another night of this. i'm going to get water at whatever bars we end up tonight though, i didn't last night and that'd be why i feel so shitty this morning. i'm going to make some toast and take my vitamins and see if that helps. i should also try the whole showering thing because sam mentioned something about going to lunch today with him and michael. and i feel all icky and i'm sure i smell all kinds of pretty. i think today is my parent's wedding anniversary too, either today or tomorrow..i don't know and it's been 30-something years. i'll call mom later and tell her.

      i just got home. carrie's 21st started at midnight so she wanted to go get a start on her 21 shots. and since i can't really spare any money for a gift right now i'm her DD free of charge. we went to buffalo wild wings around 1130 and didn't leave until about 130. then i had to help her and brently up the stairs to her apartment and make sure she was okay before i left. andy and i got into it over some shit that happened ages ago and so that's going to be interesting tomorrow if he comes because he was drunk tonight but i don't know. i was in a bad mood and trying to talk to brently or carrie was pointless because they were so drunk they couldn't even tell i was making a sentence. keith called me right as i was ready to leave to see what was up and he could tell i sounded not good so he told me to stop by on my way home. can't go to bed angry, he says.  so i went by and we sat on his basketball court and talked about all the crap that happened and it helped.  i felt old and out of place at buffalo's until a couple of the people left and then her boss started talking to me. he started getting a little too friendly the more he had to drink so i just changed seats after i got back from the potty. and it worked, he backed down and just started asking me generic stuff instead of trying to get to know you type questions. well i'm way too far into the babble so i'm going to try and sleep.

      i ended up getting a lot more sun then i thought today. my shoulders and back hurt so fucking bad right now and i only have like a fourth of my bottle of aloe liquid left. i hope i have the gallon under the sink still. my rocketbear is all red now :( i don't like this. i shouldn't go swimming but it's so much fun and who wants to swim in a tshirt? yea i'm pitiful. i'm really tired as well so i'm going to be laying down soon.

      it's my own fault i'm tired i realize but i'm still tired. i woke up around 6 this morning and decided to go back to bed, the boys ended up not letting me sleep past 8 so i decided to be productive. my ass is definetly feeling the dancing from last night. it looks like it's going to rain today which really sucks because carrie and i were going to go swimming today. seems like anytime she asks me it's going to rain. i don't know i'm tired and babbling but i've got to wash my stinky stinky clothes. i smell like i smoked a pack of cigarettes and this morning my voice sounds like an old hag. sexy right? i'm going to try not to go back to sleep because i'll wake up with a headache and that's just no fun. ok babble over.

      i had fun tonight though. sam and i went to the cabaret and i actually danced my ass off. i usually don't dance, ok i never do, except in the shower or other such places when nobody is around me, but i made the mistake of letting my guard down one night while sam was over and now he knows i can dance so he was like dammit you're going out on the floor. he has a point ... who am i trying to impress? so i shook my tail feather at a gay club. ended up meeting a few new people, one old guy came all up to me and grabbed both shoulders and told me to have a safe weekend then gave me a hug. then this girl we saw at dos amigos was all like woah dude you were behind us and she hugged me and gave me a smooch on the cheek when sam and i left. and this guy that works at olive garden was getting all friendly with jason so when we left he was all admiring my chest piece and hugged me and smooched my cheek and told me to have a good weekend then when i turned around to leave smacked the ever loving hell out of my ass. it still hurt when i got out at sam's. it was an interesting night and i have to say i'm proud of myself for getting out there and not giving a fuck what anybody thought. i had fun and i feel good, i walked this morning with murray and then danced my ass off tonight. sounds like a good little workout for me. :) now i've hit my second (well third or fourth) wind and i can't sleep. i've been up since 730 without a nap or anything. there was some sketchy shit that went down that i'm really not sure about and i'm going to have to ask around. it may keep me from going back. i'm going to try and lay here and pass out. wish me luck. come snuggle.

      this morning was interesting, lots of dogs that murray was like yea no moving on towards and then some he was like ooo wanna go home with me? he's a weird doggie. he seemed to have fun though, we walked the 3/4mile track and all over the grassy area, i just let him go where he wanted to. then he got all tired and was definetly ready to go home so i got him a snow cone and now we're back here. i would have stayed longer but he was too hot. poor black haired dog. schultz would not even have been good there. he gets too weird around other dogs. i think i'm going to start walking in this park, it feels safe and is shady for most of the trail. so i won't fry my pale skin.

      keith called me when he got off work and said he didn't want to go home so he came by for a little bit then the beer finally hit carrie and she passed out so we left. keith decided he wanted to go driving for a bit...home and woman problems...not a good combination. so he needed to talk and since it was his gas money and i don't really have a reason to be up at a normal adult-like time tomorrow i was like sure. so he dropped me back off at my car and now i am back here. i'm going to do my best to just stay home tomorrow, not holding my breath but i am expecting to accomplish the rest of my chores tomorrow. i am tired as fuck and want smooches and snuggles. goodnight.

      lunch should be interesting today, sam called me last night to see if i wanted to join him, michael, and carolyn for lunch today...erin is going with us now that he knows we're going for chinese. erin has only been around carolyn in small doses. i see this as a chance for some shit talking between the two. it'll probably end up being michael and erin sharing barnes and noble stories. don't know if sam and i will be doing anything after michael leaves or not, probably since he's off. i want a nap i woke up too early today after going to bed too late last nigt.

      even when i stay home i still don't get in the bed at a decent time. i had all my mind set on going to bed after watching the shitty tv version of helter skelter but keith called and wanted to stop by when he got off work. we finished watching godmoney..which we started last sunday.  i'm a tired megan but can't sleep yet. i hit that point and went past it so now i have to wait for it to return. i'm supposed to call him tomorrow for lunch with him and hillard. should be fun, haven't seen jason in ages. it's weird how my life all of a sudden found new things to do. michael is coming down to see sam so i know i won't be doing the typical monday thing. but i have lunch plans so all is well. goodnight.

      i just got home. i spent all day with sam, went over..had subway for lunch and then we just went pretty much anywhere and everywhere in this town. made the usual stops, tried to get glenn to join us but he wanted me to come and get him instead of him just meeting us somewhere and gas is just too expensive for all that mess. so he decided to just stay at home and not worry about it. ugh. sam and i were supposed to go to this haunted mill place with jason and misty but they never called, i'm not too terribly torn up over this though, since i'm a pussy and hate hate hate haunted houses and such. and this place is an old mill they bought once it closed down and turned the whole thing spooky. fuck that, i'll wait in the car. jason had also mentioned something about he, sam, and i going to the cabaret but since he didn't call for that either it was a no go. we did end up getting dinner and then meeting up with andy, carrie, brently, and some girl i didn't know and probably won't see again christina. she lives in greensboro so unless she come down for carrie's 21st i won't be seeing her. of course they decided to get drunk so it turned into drinking games and such. i don't really mind and don't feel left out, i just think about what it must have been like to be on the other side of me when i did that. couldn't have been a whole lot of fun. christina was gone, she drank way too many beers and was out,andy was still going but when brently decided it was bed time carrie stopped too. so sam and i left. brently and carrie are going to carowinds later today, hopefully the beer won't fuck them up too badly on the rides. oh sweet jesus the worst part was them deciding to finish their leftover steaks at like 2am. smelled so fucking bad. they should be loving that tomorrow. i'm tired and really use some cuddles. goodnight.

      sam and i saw a big sign yesterday for picking strawberries out where he lives. i so want to go today but i know if i call too early i'll wake him up and he'll be cranky. but i want to go, it's a nice day...sunny but not sticky hot. i know we're going to do something tonight but i want to go now. i may go ahead and call him around like 11 cause that's not too early when he is used to getting up at like 7 anyhow. watched american psycho at his place last night, eh. not that great, didn't scare me at all. him killing the dog was the only thing that got to me. i know this is horrible to say but i can watch a movie where kids are killed before i can watch one where an animal gets hurt.

      well today is my dad's 50th birthday. if he lived here i might have a tiny idea of what to do for him but since he's so far away i really don't know. i mailed him a card but as of yesterday it wasn't there yet. so of course that's not good enough. i know he still went to work today because my dad wouldn't take a day off if you paid him. so i'll call mom later and see if the card got there today and if not i'll have to send him an online card which doesn't mean as much as something you can hold in your hand. and he'll act like that's ok but it won't be and i'll feel like shit for it.  carolyn is on the way to her interview right now i hope she does well and gets her job, that would suck to have a position she's held for 5 years taken away from her because it pays more. there are a few other people from her store going up for it too and it makes no sense. they already have level 3 positions so it wouldn't be a move up just a move over and none of them actually want to work over the food department. i don't know i'm just glad i'm out of that bullshit store.  now if i could just fight this constant feeling of being alone i'd be set.

      i just don't want to be home these days. i like filling my time with other things, the more i sit at home the more i think about things and let stuff get to me. yea i know there are better ways to deal with stuff but right now i'm going with what works. sam and i went to see joy's baby tonight. it's very weird for me to be holding a baby. just no maternal feelings are there when i hold one. yea she's cute and she makes silly noises when she's fighting sleep but i don't want one of my own. hopefully that won't change as i get older because then it really would suck that i can't have one. samauri is a pretty baby, and she only cried when she was hungry but i still hope not to deal with her much. i'm too worried i'm going to break her. and yes that is her name and that is how joy spelled it. her middle name is fucked up too. don't know why, that's just what her and michael decided on. her other daughter's name is deasia so maybe she's not so good with choosing normal names. i still don't get along with her husband, he thinks i'm a shitty person and likes to make really rude comments around me. i just ignore him. oh well i'm going finish washing my sheets then throw them in the dryer. fun fun.

      you can say what you want, call me a fag hag or a fruit fly but i love my gay man. i seriously have some of the best nights of my life just hanging out with sam, not even doing anything. we went to buy kitty litter and cat food at walmart and laughed our asses off the whole time. he wants to go to the scary little fair they have set up in the old kmart parking lot tomorrow. i'm scared. but there will be cotton candy to be had, making all aspects of life better. i should be tired but i'm not. i'll lay down soon because there is no telling when sam is going to call tomorrow. he got wild things 2 and wants to watch it, i won't lie i want to see that shit too. i need to lay down but i don't want to go to bed alone. come snuggle with me, help me sleep the whole night.

      i'm sleepy but mom thinks that if you stay out late you should have to get up early. no fun. but she's leaving for gastonia soon so i'll just lay back down after she goes. i can't sleep too long though i have to get some stuff at target...hopefully i can remember the list she spit at me when she was waking me up. i'm going to see rent tomorrow night with carrie and her dad, i need to figure out what to wear tonight. apparently they get all dressed up to go to the theatre, which i can understand to some degree but i saw rent on broadway and nobody was dressed up. if we were going to see phantom of the opera i could see getting all fancied up, but not for rent. so this is going to be like the lunch at the country club, i'll be in dress code but i'm going to make damn sure i'm comfortable. she mentioned something about me needing to cover up my tattoos, soooo not going to even worry about that. if you aren't an employer or my father i'm not really concerned.  i just saw a commercial for the jury, i'm going to have to watch it, the cast of oz (and most of svu) is going to be guest starring.

      haven't posted in awhile because i really haven't seen a reason to. things with sam are still at a standstill, i sent an email so now all i can do is wait to see if things change. mom's hand is doing better. my legs are covered in bug bites from sitting outside at buffalo's and hanging out at nate's. went to dinner last night then came home and passed out. finally got some sleep. the end.

      i slept a lot last night and i slept a good hard sleep but i feel even more tired this morning. mom needs to do some stuff for her mom so i'm going to help her with that today. her arm is hurting more today then it did last night, she got up at 4 to take another half a pill. it's weird being the one taking care of things. so i'll be out and about with her for a little while today, i know she won't want to be out long. i need to make sure i charge my phone...fucking hell schultz just ran across the couch behind me and clawed my back all to hell. not feeling good. i need to shower and get ready then help mom wash her hair and get ready. now is the time we wish her hair wasn't so damn long. this could be interesting.

      my mom came in about 30 minutes ago and said megan come help me and i heard a bunch of shit fall in the kitchen. i go in and see her with her hand above her head and blood pouring from her hand. she sliced her fingers on the hedge trimmer. she doesn't really remember how it happened just saw blood spurt on her glasses and dropped the thing. so i called erin got him to come home and then tried to do what i could, knowing i didn't know what to do at all. i kept her talking and clean clothes to try and stop the bleeding. i am usually a-o-k with blood but seeing my mom hurt like that made me all lightheaded and queeezy. so erin and ben just took her to the ER i tried calling a few people because it'd be nice to have someone to talk to but nobody is home or their phones aren't on. so i left messages and now i just wait. hopefully they won't take as long as they did with my brother when he sliced his hand open. he can't feel a whole lot of anything in his right index finger. it was her left hand and it didn't go all the way through so those are pluses. if there are pluses. i'm just trying to get the image out of my head. ugh.

      i met up with carrie and we headed out to do some shopping and run some errands. it was an odd day, she's a tiny thing (size 4) and she likes to play dress up so shopping with her is places i'd never really think about going in. so i spent about 6 hours of my day in victoria's secret (i go in, but never spend over an hour) express, limited, lerner, you get the picture. i did end up buying a shirt. and it's not black. mmhmm you read that right, i now own a green girly polo type shirt from old navy. i wore it last night with a skirt and was actually complimented by random people i know at mcguire's. it was nice. went to dinner with melissa and her boyfriend and then of course, went to mcguire's for some fooseball action. saw a lot of people i knew there. my tattoo guy and his wife for one..that was nice, i miss seeing katie like i used to. i have a lot of things i need to do today so i should go shower and get started.

      i just got out of the shower. i was listening to a cd and just started crying...so i stood there with the water beating down on my back just crying. something isn't right. things need to be fixed...but where to start? how do you find what it is that is broken? you can't just go up to people or things and ask are we ok? is this how it's supposed to be? do you belong here? do i? are you broken? am i? these aren't things you can actually ask and get answers that solve the problems. i need to get away from things. from myself. i don't want to feel like this anymore. i don't want to be upset without knowing why. i don't want to keep talking to people and it not do me any good, i'm not solving anything just becoming more unhappy.   i'm going to dry my hair and try and make something good out of today.

      so yesterday was an up and down sort of day. i was good all day, just hung around here took care of some laundry and finally started on the dishes, one load down...one to go, and all day i was under the impression that sam and i would be hanging out last night and then go to some kind of a club afterwards. around 4pm he told me his mom was coming over and they were going to the grocery store and he was going to take a nap and then he'd call me when he woke up and we'd figure out what all we were going to do. well he got online around 8 and this is what came next...  SAM: you are so going to be mad at me ME: why SAM: i sort of have a date tonight..but but but...if he leaves on time..we can still go to the club  so i tell him to fuck off and that it's bullshit to blow off someone you consider to be such a good friend for some date with some guy you've only talked to a few times and haven't even met yet. he thought i was pissed i couldn't go to the club and couldn't get that i was pissed he just threw me aside like that. then said he didn't even want to go to the club...it was his idea. made up excuse after excuse but still wouldn't admit he'd ditched me. i've never pushed him aside for anything or anyone. i always ask him if he wants to go and if he doesn't i ask if he'd rather do something else. i'm so fucking done accommodating people. doesn't get me anything but used and fucked over. so as usual i got all upset and was crying because lately that's all i seem to do and tried to call carrie to talk to her about it but she was working so i left a sniffly voicemail. well while i'm sitting around watching episode after episode of dead like me (thank you charter on demand) then carrie calls and i explain what happens and she was all what's his number but i told her it wouldn't do any good because if he cared about what he'd done he would have called me and apologized and yea as of  9am today still haven't heard from him. so she tells me i need to come out with her and the usual rock barn group, so we go to the tavern and meet up with josh, tad, jimmy, and rob ... it was a good time. conversation i needed, random without any real depth to it. good stuff. then the boys wanted to go to sundries but we didn't feel the urge so we headed to mcguire's which was closed and then carrie declared a need for wings so we went to buffalo's. hung out there for a little while, ate a bite finally i just can't eat when i'm upset, and then headed back to carrie's.  got on here for a bit to see if maybe sam had emailed or called but no, nothing. i even talked to his mom and she asked what was up and i told her and she said she couldn't believe he would do something like that to me. so yea fuck him. he's off 3 days this week because of michael's birthday but since they aren't together now he's going to have them off with nothing to do. am i going to try and fill that time? fuuuck no. he's on his own i'm not going to be a weeble anymore, i fell down this time.

      i didn't leave the house once today. well i mean i went outside but my car hasn't moved since i got home last night/this morning. i got all the dirties washed, did the dishes and took out the trash. so now i can go out tomorrow night. keith called on his way home from the shitty 18 visions show he left after 2 songs and offered to bring us some dunkin doughnuts, i don't really like doughnuts, like my brain tells me i do but then i take a bite and i get all icky feeling so yea i don't even bother with them anymore. i am bad about eating the filling, nasty i know. so he brought some goodies and then we watched the first disc of season 1 of aqua teen hunger force. my nails are long as hell for some reason, it's weird.  well i am going to try and sleep. i want snuggles and i miss you. goodnight.

      that sums up my night. met marsha's kids, might be taking care of them two nights a week when she starts her night class. they're 6 and 8. alexis and jeremiah. wow i'm impressed i remembered that. i hope sam feels like going out tomorrow night, he hasn't been around for one of our mondays in awhile. tonight was good but could have done without a few of the people there. now glenn is talking to me about d&d shit that i really just don't care about. or really understand, but he sure is typing away. i think it just might be my bedtime.

      went to dinner with carrie, brently, and melissa then went back to carrie's apartment to watch the believer, carrie fell asleep so we didn't get to finish it. i'll end up renting it for myself i was all into it and then bam carrie went out. keith had sent me a message during dinner asking what i was up to (more madison problems) so i called him to see what he was up to. so we went riding around our little town for awhile. listening to music and talking about his girl problems. i think they broke up, from how he was talking it sounded like they did. i just don't think he wants to face it yet, which i can understand. he knows i'm here if he needs any late night drives to clear his head. and i claremont is a bigger place than i thought. cute places to drive around too. i took notes for later dates :) he does play some shit though, i don't remember half the names of the bands but i know they were poo. but i just let him do whatever and listen. try to interject when i think i have something to say. and now i'm talking to sam who is having more relationshit issues. i want sleep and cuddles but i'm going to be the good friend and talk to him until he's calmed down.  goodnight.

      last night was good, planned on just going to the movie and dinner with sam but then people started calling and joining in. jeremy caught up with us at target and then andy and lonnie (i think that's how you spell it) met up with us at applebee's. then we all but jeremy went back to sam's house to play trivial pursuit and eat watermelon. i actually won the game, shocking, i never win when we play here. but then again erin knows way too many random things for it to be a fair game. i saw joey at applebee's, it was good to see him, i need to stop by his business sometime, it's not far from the house but i never think about it. and i suck at going into someplace without someone knowing i'm coming. he always wants me to stop by but what if he's busy. i don't know. i've known that guy since i was 13, he was impressed to see me in what i was wearing last night. joey is used to me being in some band shirt and cargo shorts or jeans and etnies. so it was nice for him to see me looking like a girl. he hadn't seen my chest piece and was like so i see you're still straightedge. i don't think he is, i don't think he has been for a long time. i miss going over to his house and watching cartoons when i'd skip school. but i don't miss why i was skipping school. joey's was where i'd go when i couldn't take being in the same school as daniel anymore. because my mom didn't work at that point and was home so i couldn't go there, she still doesn't know. probably never will. carrie wants to plan a road trip to atlanta, that would kick so much ass. i don't have the money to do it but it's fun to think about. i can always tell her where to go. she's never been. i am tired but need to start cleaning up this place. dishes to wash and a room to clean. fun fun fun.

      i think there is something in the air around me...everyone i know seems to be having problems. sam got dumped, drew and brian aren't doing so well, i just keep thinking what next? sam is now at the angry stage and is no fun to try and talk to. i'm putting up with it because of course i've been dumped and know what this is like but i didn't do it so he needs to keep a control on his tone. we were supposed to all be going to mcguire's tonight but i'm not sure now. i wish sam would come out and go, fooseball would do him some good. even if only for a little while. i stretched my ears again this morning, the mood struck when i got out of the shower. i think this is as far as i can go though without having to buy something and if i'm buying anything in that department it's going to be a tattoo. i really hope erin gets me one for my birthday. that's all i really want, that and a letter. or at least a card if a letter is too much to ask for. i still haven't done the dishes i just don't want to. i know it's dumb and i know it'll take like 30 minutes but i hate doing them. i feel the need for a change...hair clothes something just feel the need for one. maybe it's just the pms talking i don't know.

      michael broke up with sam so i spent most of today with him trying to cheer him up. i didn't succeed but i did make him not cry for a few hours. i just wish there was something i could do. i'm really sleepy i don't know why though, i slept long enough last night and did do anything today really. i guess i'm just tired. i'll probably go to bed soon unless i hit a second wind. if that happens i so need to clean the damn kitchen.

      he's been neglecting his dog a lot and it's making him sad. the dog, not erin, i'm sure erin could give a fuck. so schultz has been in a weird weird mood and like sleeping in my room when nobody is in here and the lights are off. just hanging out by himself. well i woke up this morning to the fact that erin needs me 2 new pillows because i took both dogs out and my dog peed for days and schultz was just like what...why are we out here so early momma? so yea, schultz pissed all over two of my pillows and my freshly made bed. so i am awake at 430 am trying to clean it up and wash my sheets and mattress pads. this fucking sucks and i haven't had a decent night of sleep in so long it's now a joke to me. sorry to be so bitchy, just wondering what comes next. at least i get a break from kati staying in the house, she's going out of town.&nbsp; i'm going to try and get some sleep on the sofa. wish me luck.

        again my birthday festivites have turned into shit for erin. my 13th was spent in a laundromat in laurensburg washing his dirties because he was at governor's school and couldn't manage to do his own damn laundry. my 18th was cancelled because erin didn't want a lot of people in his part of the house. now my 21st being poo was definitely dad's doing. we all know the story so moving on to this year. it's not my birthday yet and i understand that, it's not for another week but my parents are up now to celebrate it. what did dad get? a riding lawnmower. who's on it? erin. no i don't want to be on it, just saying, he got it for erin for my birthday. and now the girl my brother is dating is going along with us for my birthday dinner. so it'll turn out just like last night where i'm the 5th person who just sits there. i tried to talk and add things last night but i got no response. i asked erin a handful of different things and he didn't even acknowledge i was speaking and went on to say something to someone else. i got the paper and an iwanna so i can start looking for an apartment or one bedroom house thing. there are some tiny houses in this area that are pretty cheap. hell if it's just me i can do a duplex type situation and be just fine. i'm just not a fan of apartments, especially not with murray. who knows what's going to happen with schultz. i just know i want to crawl into a hole and disappear for awhile.

      i'm home from the beach but i don't want to be. i wasn't even here 4 hours before erin and i got into it and it's stupid. he's seeing some girl that apparently has been sleeping here everynight. well if she's going to be staying here she needs to chip in on some rent. he's being an asshole about it too, he locked schultz out of his room so he kept me up all night because he can't get comfortable in here, he doesn't sleep in here, moo does. moo passed out in no time and didn't move again until he wanted to go out this morning. erin said he doesn't care that mom and dad are coming up he's not going to help me clean, he's got plans on thursday...his day off. mom said she's going to call him today and try to motivate him to help. i can get my room, the kitchen, the bathroom, and the living room that isn't his boxes of shit. but on a happy note my ear is doing better, i slept some on my left side and it didn't really bother it. now i'm going to start on laundry because i didn't bother seperating what was dirty when i packed up to come home so i've got a basket full.

      i just sneezed so hard i busted my lip. i've been awake since 5:20 this morning, i crashed at carrie's last night because we have to take mom to the airport in a little bit and it made more sense for me to crash there then to come home and wake erin up. since he'll be the one driving to the airport. it's so foggy outside. like you can't see the exit until you're right there at it foggy. not good. also not good, my cell phone service. i thought sprint was bad but now i'm thinking cingular can bite the big one. i'm missing calls when i don't even hear the phone ring...or feel it since it's in my pocket. and i'm getting messages way after they're left. carrie left me one yesterday at 1-something and i didn't get it until around 9. my cold is getting better, now it's just all the nastiness in my chest breaking up. so lots of that oh so sexy coughing and hacking...nice right? i want the chair that is in carrie's living room, it's one of those chair and half deals. soooo fucking comfy. that's what i sleep in when i stay over. i've been invited to a few different gatherings today but i think i'm going to just stay home. unless i find out someone is grilling out, because i want a boca burger grilled up instead of just microwaved for a change. get some pepperjack cheese and i'll be a happy megan. schultz is all stretched out beside me on the bed, i don't think he really wants to be awake either. looks like he partied a little too hard...back legs all stretched out and the front left one over his face. that dog is too damn cute. i'm going to do my best to stay awake on the way home from the airport but i'm not going to place any bets on it. riding in the car more than an hour makes me sleepy anyhow and i didn't really get much sleep last night, we got back to her place early but ended up talking until early this morning. tater tots were had at 3am =) i'm going to try and get erin up again.

      i'm even more sick now then i was before but i'm working on getting better. i'm not doing anything today or tonight, just going to sit on my ass and relax. well and go take care of spencer for a bit. sit with him so he'll eat his breakfast and sit with him so he'll eat his dinner. i saw fahrenheit 9-11 last night that movie is really good and really long. it started at 1030, we didn't get out until like 1245. and thankfully my body decided it needed to pee during a really disturbing part, keith let me know when i got back what i'd missed. didn't miss a damn thing worth seeing. ick. i hope i stop sneezing soon...i just sneezed 7 times in a row...not cool. i need to get dressed and go sit with the puppy.   achoo.

      ok so again, i can't sleep. this is a little annoying but at least last night i got more than i have been getting.  i finally gave up around 530, took moo to pee...which thank buddha he did pee, because he left my bed for a few minutes and i was convinced he'd decided to relieve himself inside but i guess he was just trying to get into erin's room. i made them take schultz with them last night, which is probably why i got more sleep than normal. he doesn't sleep well in my bed, he nudges me all night long. that word doesn't look right but i guess that's how you spell it. it's 530 in the morning i'm not that concerned with spelling. =) right now i'm just trying to keep moo asleep so he'll leave them alone and forget he wants his food this early. it's way too dark and cold outside to feed and walk him right now. so i covered him back up and when i finish this post i'll join him back in bed. it's cold in this house, me thinks erin got up or kati did and turned the air down. i need to remember to go to the vet today, i need to get them heartworm pills before the 8th. i keep forgetting though, or like yesterday i didn't leave the house until after 5, when they close. so i'm hoping i'll remember today. i forgot to take my rings off before bed last night and my fingers feel funny. hooray for early morning babbles. i'm going to try laying back down with moo and see if i can't get at least another hour of sleep, two would kick ass. goodnight.

      i could not sleep last night for anything. i tried going to bed several times. couldn't get comfortable then when i was comfortable i would just lay there, keeping my eyes closed just wasn't an option. i finally got to sleep around 130 just to wake up again at 3 and then back to sleep around 4 to wake up at 5. stayed up until 7 then slept until about 5 minutes ago. it's weird. i feel ok, just couldn't stay asleep.  when mom let schultz out of erin's room this morning he completely bypassed his breakfast to come tell me hello. i haven't seen the boy grin so much in quite awhile. i wish i could have videotaped it because it was some good stuff. you'll see it soon enough though =)   mom and i are going to head out and take care of some stuff i think, i sorta half paid attention to the shit she was saying. i just know i need to shower and wear a shirt she doesn't find offensive.  and one big benefit to not living with erin anymore is i won't have to take the calls for the people he owes money to. our phone rings all damn day and it's all from the business and him not taking care of things. hope kati enjoys having a phone ring constantly.  ok time to get naked and clean

      i've been putting off making a post because i didn't want it to turn into me bitching about how bad my birthday was because everyone's already heard about it so we'll just say next year's is going to be better and go with that.  things with erin seem to be improving but i'm still keeping my safe distance and not saying too much to him or kati. i told my doctor and he said he was going to call that boy and talk some sense into him...i wish him luck. it's just a weird situation, the only time she hasn't slept here was because she was out of town. i'd like to see a little help on the rent check, which is due today, maybe that's just me. wow i'm going to be writing my own rent checks soon. like every cent is going to be paid by me. i have thought about moving and where and it just can't sink in. like i keep expecting something to be like haha fooled you. but i know it's not going to. i don't know if i want to stay in hickory or not. i guess it all depends on where i can afford to move. i could move in with carrie but that would just not be a good situation. my dog would end up getting a hold of some pot and i'd end up in jail for beating up whomever's pot it was. the one time i took him over there it was on the coffee table and i caught him just in time. so that's out, besides i'm not a huge fan of people just coming over whenever they feel like it, i don't know how many people have a key to that place. if she even bothers to lock it. so yea, no to living with carrie. keith said something about getting a place if he doesn't go away to school but that would just bring about another weird situation. need a please take a number counter for the ladies he brings home. but i could deal with that so much easier than the whole drug and drinking thing on a regular/daily basis. hickory does have some cheap one bedroom places. moo and i would be good in a studio apartment too. we don't need much. i'm just going to have to figure out where to keep him when i leave because he can't be trusted just out and about in the house. hopefully there will be a kitchen or laundry room i can just put a baby gate up for. it's not like i'd ever leave him longer than for work or something like that. speaking of work i have to go back to dealerships and apply now that people will be going away to school. i want to do office work again, i actually enjoy the answering of phones and filing and organizing stuff. mom says that makes me a weirdo. i say so be it, i made 250 a week doing it when i was 16 and want to go back to that. ugh no more grown up thoughts, i woke up with an awful headache this morning. it's still there. evil bastard needs to go away. maybe i just need to eat something so i'll go make breakfast when mom gets back. no sense in cooking twice and us both eating alone.  during this post i have busted schultz sucking on his leg twice...nasty bastard.  i've been up off and on since 6am, my sleep is so fucked up lately. i feel ok though, and i know it'll go back to normal soon. it does this from time to time, i guess everyone's does. i just remember it being really bad when i was in junior high and mom and dad taking me to do the doctor and them giving me sleeping pills that i never took. i'd just hide it in my mouth and then flush it. fuck a bunch of sleeping pills.  my mood has improved a lot lately too, although you probably can't tell it from this post because it's got a bit of a bitchy tone to it. but that's just what happens when a headache is present and i'm awake because some woman called to see if i loved the lord jesus christ and what church i went to. not even a good way to wake up. like i'd even say i never want to wake up like that again in my life. i want to wake up next to my dog and my man who i hope to get a visit from at the end of the month. if i was a keeping my fingers crossed kinda woman i'd have my fingers crossed right now about it. ok i'm at least going to get something to drink, maybe i just need water and my headache will stop, i hope so. because if i end up with one of my headache pills i'll just go back to sleep and i'd kind of like to experience some of today at least. don't know what i'm doing, i never know when mom is in town.
