       Mood: Bleeding Argh!  NP: Jack Off Jill - Strawberry Gashes  I wrote "hate" and "blind" on my arm in japanese. Awww it will look pretti later. Looks mank at the mo but thats just cos there is blood everywhere. I also went pretty crazy on the rest of my arm. The writing was just some body mod. The crazy cutting-ness was cos i was pissed off. Alot. I feel calmer now. But Andy is pissing me off. He always does though. Nob. I am really tired so thats all i will write tonight.  --May--

       Mood: Ill  NP: AC/DC - Back In Black  So is it possible to have insomnia and hypersomnia at the same time?? Cos once i decide i wanna go to sleep it takes me about 5-6 hours to actually get to sleep. And once i am asleep, if no one waked me up, i could sleep up to 2 days. So maybe thats possible. Maybe i am just wierd. Yer... Thats probably it. Reeeeeally couldnt sleep last night. I didnt end up going to sleep just cos i was too hyper from the caffiene. --NO MORE CAFFIENE-- . So anyway. Yus i did cut last night but that was to be expected. I did 9 new ones. Onli small ones cos i was testing out my new razor. They were thin but they were pretty deep. They bled looooots.   Hmm... No one ever seems to wanna listen to me. I mean. My friends just dont care. I hate living, breathing, suffering. I hate my friends and family. Fuck i just need to get out. And no one cares. *cries*  --May--

       Mood: Crap  NP: Jack Off Jill - When I Am Queen  So yay... I am sick. I hate being sick. I mean when i was at school i would always wish that i would get sick and always ended up getting sick in the holidays instead. Just my luck though. But i'm not to pissed that i am ill. Generally because i dont have to go to school ever again anyway. Well except for exams. But thats like 2 hours at the most.  I feel pretty shit. I could just be that i am ill. But i just feel shit anyway. I dont see the point in living right now. I mean no one would miss me. Or in my opinion no one would miss me. I mean my friends cant even be bothered to let me know that our plans have changed and instead just ditch me without warning. I dunno. That doesnt really matter. I just dont feel like i can control anything anymore. Not even my own life. I mean i dont control what i wanna do or where i wanna go. My friends and family do that for me. "No yoo cant go out" or "Sorry we cant be arsed doing that anymore". It really pisses me off. Take Clark as an example "Oh by the way yoor coming to alton towers"... I am?... "Yer i already paid for yoo"... Oh thanx. I mean its a nice thought and everything but what if i dont wanna go. Cos he paid i have to.   I would like some control back please!!! I think thats part of the reason i SI. Cos when i do it I am the one in control. None of my friends or family can stop me doing it cos its private. I dunno... Just me in a mood i guess.  --May--
