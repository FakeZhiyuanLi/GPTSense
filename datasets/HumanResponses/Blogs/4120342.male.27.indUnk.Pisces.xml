      I have a new friend named Todd.  Todd's been driving on a suspended license for a week.  He was parking on this same street, and his buddy got the same ticket, so his buddy's license is probably suspended, too.  Todd lives on the other side of Mount Washington in a place that, if it were in Venice, would cost him, like, $8000 a month.  Todd's company's in Cypress Park, over by Eagle Rock.  Everyone there's young and cool, so it's cool.  They used to work out of this old Craftsman, but they had to go from room to room, so their new place is so much better.  Todd's work doesn't always pay much, but there's the perks of going to concerts.  Todd likes dance and techno stuff like Air, but he's even worked for bands like Hootie and the Blowfish.  After awhile, Todd realized the concerts weren't anything special.  They just became work.  Todd used to work at lots of start-up dot-coms, but he hated the whole corporate atmosphere.  One was this website to get women to invest.  These women would talk about their layouts and fonts and stuff and have no idea what to do, while his programmers upstairs would be all frustrated.  One day, Todd plans to sell his business.  Todd's dad invented the long lighters, the kind you use to light a fire or something.  Todd's parents took their money and invested in real estate.  While Todd's parents' friends took a bath in the stock market, what with the dot-coms and all, Todd's parents were cool.  Todd has met so many real estate entrepreneurs in L.A.  Todd knows all these people who are like, "Yeah, I own five rental properties," and they're just twenty-five and doing their thing.  It's strange, but Todd never drives to the Westside.  It's weird because he used to live there.  He had a studio apartment right on the beach, which was great.  Todd's thinking of going back home to Colorado, though.  Later on, Todd's heading out to Santa Monica to check on something, then maybe will meet his buddy for a bite to eat.  Todd has to call him back on that.  But most of all, Todd likes to talk loudly in line at Superior Court, broadcasting all sorts of personal information I couldn't care less about that details a life far more privileged than 99% of the other people present over the mostly silent queue.  I hate Todd.  I hate Todd so much.

      So I'm currently job-hunting.  That's right, I've decided to leave my horrible job.  I'll likely land in another horrible job, but at least it will be a different horrible job.  Today was the straw that broke the camel's back when my insane boss with fifty-seven personalities informed me I'd have the new, extremely shitty shift of eight to five.  The extra half-hour I'd sit in traffic would increase my fuel costs for the month fifty percent, bring more wear and tear and my already worn-and-torn car, and, oh yeah, I don't deserve a raise, even though I've assumed all the duties of the department, bringing the grand total of people I've replaced to three.  Life keeps getting better.  Stay tuned next week, when I'm certain to be diagnosed with cancer.

      Anyone who has seen my poor ghetto car knows that its most distinguishable trait has been the plethora of duct tape. For those who don't know the story, after maybe three days, I bent off the driver's side mirror at a gas station when I backed into one of those concrete posts. The passenger-side mirror went last November when an oncoming car forced me into the mirror of a parked car on the very narrow Orlando Avenue. So duct tape has abounded. The floor of my car is covered in balls of the stuff as I'd peel off the old stuff to replace it. In the summer heat, the adhesive would melt, and the heavy mirrors would hang limply off the sides - sometimes while driving.  But, at last, my mirrors have been replaced! I had to, seeing as I'm now forced to register my car in California. (An extra-special thanks to the cop that pulled me over. I'm sure all the people being raped and murdered at that moment in time thank you, too.) A very kind coworker not only put the new mirrors on, he also put in new spark plugs and showed me how to change the lamps in my rear lights. I'm slightly less automotively retarded today! And no more duct tape for me!

      I'm developing a real fondness for the Luddites.  I've tried a half-dozen times to post this.  Let's hope this time it works.  Anyway, the sun is slowly creeping over the horizon, and it shines ever more brightly on the shores of Woolseyana.  I made contact with my oldest, dearest friend in L.A. late last night, and it made a huge difference in how I'm feeling today.  Also, I'm feeling more confident in how my script's going.  I'll keep the blog posted on my progress.  It will be done before the end of August.  Oh, and I got a bottle of Comme des Gar√ßons 2 today.  I've been lusting after this stuff forever; it's conceptual art one can spray.  I'm so materialistic...

      That's right, kids. Andrew's planning another outing to Rodeo Drive soon. I've got to check out this new Prada boutique that's supposed to be an architectural landmark, and maybe some Japanese tourists will take my picture. Who knows? Maybe if I manage to slip myself into enough of their photographs, I could become a god in Japan!  Some friends of mine and I are tentatively going to Rodeo Drive on Saturday, August 28. If you're interested in joining up, drop me a line. There will be gelato involved.

      So it's come to this. Andrew Woolsey has stooped to blogging. It only seems natural, as I'm given to long, rambling missives to friends and contemporaries. Of course, it seems I haven't many of those any longer. It seems the last of my comrades has fallen under my knife today. It's been a long time coming, really. This friend - we'll call her "The Physician" - has, with great imperiousness, derided me for dissuading a friend of hers from moving into the building we live in. I really think it's a simple difference of opinion: She finds dalmatian piss in the elevator quaint; I don't. (Of course, were the good doctor to encounter the carny-esque inhabitants of apartment 108 as I did last weekend, perhaps those rose-colored Dolce & Gabbana glasses would slip down a few centimeters.) So I'm now History's Greatest Monster. Hooray. She says she's mad that I ruined someone's happiness. "I could've helped her," she told me.  Ah ha! The revealing clue! You see, our good Physician loves to have her fingers in everyone's pies. She's truly happiest when she's telling people exactly how to live their lives. What to where, where to work, how to speak and what: She has an opinion on everything. And why shouldn't she? After all, she's perfect! Oh, wait...  Whenever I have the urge to go up to someone, look them in the eye, and tell them exactly how I feel they should live their life, I think of that wonderful line from the Bible:  Physician, heal thyself.  It's truly brilliant, so pithy and perfect. It's seems to be a universal truth, the people most intent on telling people what's wrong with them are the ones who are the most messed up. And my dear Physician is no different. It's not the friend's loss she mourns; it's her own. It was her opportunity to have another subject to cajole, to cut, to belittle in that ever-so-caring way. It was her opportunity to make herself feel so good by making someone else feel so bad.   Physician, heal thyself.   And so falls another of my friends. Of course, I've been practising a lot of slash-and-burn diplomacy as of late. One-by-one, my friends have been cut out like so much rotten flesh. Some of them made the formal announcements, but, had I wanted them around, I wouldn't have done what I did in the first place, would I? Others have slipped off in silence. It's strange, really: As I examine the freshly cleared hall of my life, I probably should be sad. But no, I'm not. Not really. It's liberating, in a way. So much has built up inside, so much anger and resentment and animosity. Pin pricks become impalements, and every corner of my world is red. I need this. I need the room emptied so I can began my cleaning.  It's time for the great work to begin. To myself I say,  Physician, heal thyself.
