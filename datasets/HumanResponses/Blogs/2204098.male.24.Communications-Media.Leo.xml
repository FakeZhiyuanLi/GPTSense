       It is supposed that the mercies of God are "new every morning". I'll skip the question about whether that applies in the afternoon or not.   The question of yesterday was interesting.  John K., Christina and I had a pretty heated discussion of whether the Church replaces Israel as Gods chosen people.   whoever knows the answer, please post.

        I have nothing to say;    i purchased a rolling stone magazine this evening during my grocery shopping. It's features the top 500 albums of all time. i'll spare you the suspense, #1 Sgt pepper #3, #5 are also beetles.   AM I DONE YET?!?!  There are things i'm afraid to say, so i'll just say them.  I'm afraid to say that my 100 years of flight project is  finished. Because i don't want to jinks it. My advice.  never sign a contract which ambiguously states that you will supply a completed film on dvd in working order.   "completed" is such a relative term, you're sure to be  screwed. SIGNOFFS DANIEL! GET SIGNOFFS.    wedding films  i am slated to shoot my first wedding next week. Ironically, thats also the same week i'm scheduled to fail my sociology class.  just kidding mom.   jennifer hart and ron anderson are marrying. I hope to get some  footage to put together a demo reel to show prospective clients.  i'll let you know when framedFilms.com actually goes up.   yeah. i really have nothing to say tonight. I'm tired, but not like sleepy. I'm tired in that i miss the peace with my heavenly father.  I'll close the rolling stone now and see if that peace is anywhere  to be found.

        urlLink The Day After Tomorrow    This preview strikes a chord in me. Along the lines  of The Perfect Storm, which, forgive me, i never saw; it  seems to illicit fear by involking the only thing which we should  really fear. God's judgement.   This movie seems more like a prophetic warning than  entertainment. It makes me wonder if i am called along  similar lines, career wise.

        california new wave comeback  yes, here at the style desk, it's official. The 80's are back.  Heavy.  I know it was just the next logical progression from Jan 1, 1990.  for some, they never went out. (my dad still wears his aviator  glasses from the 70's unironicaly, and has for 3 decades)  For some, the 80's never went out. For some, they've been back in for a year or two. I would like to remind the later group that this style desk is in the midwest and possesses at least 3 year  latency period.   there's really no need to research this period, but if you're interested  urlLink here you go    80's new wave music, is it back?  The beats are choppy. the synths are in front.  we're not ashamed to hear those ever-so-white 808- 4/4 drums pumpin'.   jump on the train. coke will be back in before you know it. I'mma get a jump on my  urlLink tom Cellic  mustache. wait.    cali, new wave, and why it's, like, so back  you dont care, but if you wanted proof  urlLink the strokes are making it pop  watch the video.

The sequences are rendering now.   urlLink rock on chicago

       a day of rest was nice. I am looking forward to this week like a down mattress in a candle lit room. or  a lazy afternoon with gentle music and a cup of tea by the fireplace.    EIGHT CRAZY NIGHTS: REVIEW  wow. this movie was horrible. who recommended this piece of crap to me. I took it back to blockbuster ASAP just so it's suck didn't lay around and stink up my flat.    I'M GETTING FATTER  and i don't like it.    LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS  I so wish i would stop spewing hurtful comments at those i love. It's never my intention. I desire wisdom here, i can clearly see my lack of it.   as a very important aside, I am deeply apologetic to those many of you whom i have been overly critical, brash, rude, condescending, intolerant,  unloving or otherwise offended with any careless words that have come from my mouth. Please pray that i gain wisdom in this area. It seems that if anyone has spent any amount of time with me, they have fallen victim to this verbal foolishness. I ask forgiveness.    THE JEWISH THING AGAIN?  i think it's more about the hospitality and idea of the sabbath dinner being community oriented that is shaping my view on things.   For me, people who love me tend to shape my theology.  When I was at Cedarville College still, my freshman year, and Chloe Woods (james now) took time to talk to me, and visit from columbus, and hang out, It had a major impact on how I viewed the spiritual gifts. The same with Jim Hicks. His time and caring made me question my belief system.   I can see the same thing happening here.  The Osborne family (not ozzy) has consistently shown me love, kindness and an open home and dinner table despite my flaws and sins. That love and compassion has caused me to question if what they are doing is producing more love in their lives.   More love, to me, is always a desirable thing. I do want to bless Israel, they bless israel and love it, I want to call the sabbath day a delight. It seems to delight them, and they love me so much specifically in relation to their open home on that particular night. This is how my thinking has gone, anyway.   I'm not dismissing my questioning, but just noticing the origin.

        100 years of flight : DONE   finished and shipped the DVD to CA today at 3:30pm (drove it to the airport PO).   Feels nice to be finished. Imma sleep for a few days now.  goodnight     MIDDLE SCHOOL WORSHIP   an incredible return from the worst week ever.   I guess about a month ago i've just started caring  a whole lot more about it, or maybe i'm just more  excited about it. Thats probably more like it. I picked up some new team members  I went from like 3 people in the band including myself at one point (there were also the times of 2 and one) to now having today, what was it, 8 or so. as toby Mac puts it,  "love was in the house, and the house was packed."  Honestly it was SO different that i felt set up. It's like they all had a meeting and said, ok let's all get into it and clap spontaneously and sing and all that jazz. I don't know, I know that it was VERY apparent that last week sucked.   heres a shoutout to alex petit, worshipper extrordinaire who  happens to play bass for me now. And another shout to  renee vagner, (aka: the tigress river) She's got the gift. It's scary.  ok, for real now,    goodnight

        It's hard to be a step-mother, i'm sure.   Today, I visited Mark at his office, He works with my step-mom. I stopped in to say hello to her quickly. It was appropriately awkward, as i  expected. after all, i was an unexpected visitor,  and way out of context for her work environment,  there's no doubt about it.   everything was normal, weird, but then i glanced over at a half-sized file cabinet with picture frames sitting atop it.   Sitting there framed amidst the clutter of papers  was my senior picture. (you know, the one where my hair is all wind blown and i'm wearing that flannel  shirt with my rolled up sleeves leaning against a fence post to prove that when i run for office some day that i was a real-life hard workin' country boy)  My step mother, has my picture in her office.  weird. I don't have any pictures of her that i'm aware of. (thats par for the course though, no grandparents  1 dad, a few of ashley, 1 of mom, 3 or 4 of meghan)  I wonder why it's there. I wonder if apart from the years of turmoil, she actually cares about me.  It's safe to say that thought may have never crossed my mind. I would never ask her these things. my  brain isn't big enough to even assess the possible outcomes.

       100 years of Flight - 17 Days of Glory is rendering on  Bob Sullivan's EMac as i sit here listening to some music  i've recorded and belle and sebastian.   I like belle and sebastian better.   I have had a HUGE charge toward songwriting, recording lately. i don't know, oh yes, it was mike burkett. After a slew of disappointed responses at my attempt at acoustic driven indie rock, someone listened and actually liked it.   Sure, we may have had a few glasses of wine. But he could "hear" it nonetheless. That's something maybe people cant do, or cant do naturally enough that it's easy to enjoy rough recordings.

        the perils of editing  CATHARSIS: one last pass taking all of the crap out of a movie you didn't like putting together in the first place.   DISAPPOINTMENT: movie length start: 1hr 45 ending length 1hr 32  It is fun throwing stuff away though.  Like cleaning a closet. chopping talk of "i'm the electrical uh, electric um, or  i guess electrical engineer here at . . . and i guess i handle all the electric passes that go through me"  It makes me wonder what the crap i was  thinking when i left it in in the first place.    ON ANOTHER NOTE: middle school worship  Received a good comment from Joshua Neds-Fox (no relation) on the struggles of middle school worship leading. JNF was my predecessor at the Rock for several years, so his opinion, as in most cases, weighs in with high respect.   He says it's worth it. That something is changing.  Something is happening. kids hearts are . . . ??  I guess someone has to do it. I mean, i'm at the vineyard  right? It's not like we can make a sandwich here without a half hour of worship before hand.   I guess i just don't get it. Leading worship is for people to engage their hearts in giving thanks to God. If kids don't know, or don't want to do that, then there is no leading  going on. Maybe the roll is better coined as worship teacher (yeah i want that title like i want bells around the edge of garment and a rope tied to my feet to pull me out when i fall dead) Or maybe worship modeler. Thats more palatable.   But if i'm modeling, then i'm facing the wrong direction, i should have my back turned to the kids, facing the same direction, symbolically toward "Jesus" but actually toward the screen so i can read the words.   Either way, this week is going to be packed out with guests. Alex p(middle school) on bass adam h: drums dfox: guitar renne v: vocals lisa m: vocal   **very special guests jesse b: xtra soundboard support and electronics "kid prodigy #2" michelle w: vocal "homegroup leader" matt h: keys. "back from the dead"  thats 8 bloody people. that a lot of frosties during our wendies break.

       Do you ever have one of those times when you ask Jesus for something, and almost immediately  the accompanying faith wells up in you to the point where you are no longer asking, but thanking?  I had an experience like that last night.   Heres my theory on faith. I will preface this by saying i really don't know from a theological standpoint if this is descriptive at ALL, but here goes.   God is the initiator of all things that require faith. Therefore, if God is not initiating you to have faith for a new Lexus,  your believing is probably most misdirected.   God gives us a container for our faith, before we start believing. Like yesterday, i realized i missed a science exam and i would have to drop / fail the class if i was not able to make it up. Soon after I started praying, i knew that God was going to handle it.   It wasn't this, "Oh, yeah, i'll probable be able to make it up anyway so i shouldn't worry about it" There were some very real odds i was up against. But God brought the faith, which produced thankfulness and assurance that what I hoped for was in fact a certainty.   does God give faith for Lexus's? If so, which God? and  if his name is American Materialism where can i kill him so Jesus can reign and i can continue to side with the  oppressed throughout history.

       I'm really starting to love being at home. But there's an interesting combination of thing happening to bring me to that state of mind.  First of all, I am starting to feel God's peace and pleasure here more often, it really is becoming a place of rest. I put some christmas lights up for atmosphere. But the second thing is the one that concerns me. i don't like being around people so much right now.  I really am finding i don't have a ton of patience for other people.   Ironic, i know, seeing as how i am a person who seems to demand a lot of patience from others. But being alone a lot and enjoying it makes being with others less and less satisfying. I guess maybe for someone like me who seeks satisfaction in relationships, it's a step toward finding my fulfillment in a more correct place. What i don't want to happen though is for me to lose patience or compassion for others.   All that said. I enjoy my house now. I like the quiet. I like that i can  control how clean, cold, quiet, food stocked, and lit it is, always. This is my first sustained time living without a roommate or family, and, while i was definitely a little worried on the outset, a month and a half has  proven me to be adapting quite nicely.   I do still struggle with depression from time to time. Manifest mostly through excessive sleep, loss of motivation, worry, and loneliness.  I really do hope that will not visit me here. I would like to think that since the "inbox" of my fulfillment is changing, that the same things that would normally send me into sadness, will not stick this time.   I led worship again for the middle school kids at vineyard tonight.  I was possibly the most discouraged that i have ever been in doing that. And i KNOW that that IS the single most used attack against this specific ministry, discouragement. My drummer adam was really discouraged too. When i consider his feelings it makes me want to be strong and not indulge the discouragement on my own so in some way i can be an example.   I'm seriously considering for next week, standing on the stage in a circle with my back to the kids. Still seeking to lead them and serve them, but i just don't know if i can face their blank stares and standoffish body language and their refusal to participate (many of them).  I know of worship leaders who don't want their ego's massaged  on stage and so they don't look at the people their leading. But this is quite a different thing, I want to , and have come to worship Jesus, but quite honestly, if almost NO ONE is into it, it feels like i'm on stage performing and I hate that.

       Allen, the flight documentary director came up today again with a few tapes containing an interview with amanda wright-lane, a great granddaughter of one of the wright brothers.   I'll get to editing this on sunday. I should have an almost-finished documentary by monday morning when he visits again.   Tonight is the sabbath. the day of rest. the shabbat. I am here on my bed with my laptop and a few new strands of white christmas lights which i threw up around the room last eve.   I think the thing i like so much about the command/tradition of the sabbath is that in this particular season of my life, I feel called to a slightly greater degree of comfort with solitude.   So here i am.   Just finished two frozen fish burritos: one with cheese, one without.   delightful sabbath meal.   In response to some of the questioning about moving toward a more Jewish-rooted christian faith system, the best answer is that this feels like a circular journey, even on the outset. I don't expect to convert to Judaism or Seventh Day Adventism for that matter.   But i feel like there's an understanding of context which i am missing in my faith. The best way to describe it, may be to describe around it.   For a few years now, i have not readily understood that the God I serve demands holiness. I have come to Him as a friend, companion,  mother, father, even king. But the Holiness of God is not something that seems easily translated into an analogous earthly relationship.   But it is an aspect of the Character of God that i have overlooked.   Here is my journey. I can not be holy.  I know that from the outset.   There will be no denying that Jesus is himself responsible for allowing me access to God by HIS holy life. But there is still a call toward Holiness.  There is still a BLESSING in striving toward living a Holy life. I don't know where the line of freedom is drawn for me. I wasn't kidding about having some level of anxiety for breaking the sabbath. Even Jesus, and i'm assuming the apostles observed the sabbath. The commandments dictate its observation.  History testifies to it's pragmatism. And the principle of giving to the Lord tells me that if i sacrifice my time to rest by His command and set apart a day for  holiness, I will be blessed back with a pressed down and overflowing measure.

       It's after home group. I'm tired. I was tired before i left. 3 hours of sleep last night had me expecting such weakness. But what i didn't expect was in this self-imposed, work-related, sleep deprived weakness,  God would seem to use me in some very fun ways.   I came with the plans of hiding out for a night. being a spectator. I'm not sure if that's even really possible with me and the chemistry of this group.  probably something i need to work toward. backing off. hmm. . .  But this came up tonight.   eph. 2:12 remember that at that time you were separated from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world,  v.14 for He Himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed  the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, by abolishing in his flesh the law  with it's commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace, and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.   v.19 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household. . .   This doesn't sound to me like the church is now Israel. It sounds to me like Gods intentions are to make the two (Israel and a gentile church) into one body of God's beloved through Jesus Christ, the Messiah of Israel and the world.   This is after "they killed Jesus" if you will. This is after the religious  leaders of Biblical Israel had rejected the saving one. So it's not as if systematic theology had actually changed between the time this book was written and the time we re-interpreted it.   We (the gentile church) are the ones who were "grafted into" Israel. Let's not start thinking we've taken the place of the ones of whom, since the beginning,  it was said "I will be their God, and THEY will be my people."  Humbled to be a part of such things, respectful of that which i have been  brought into.

       Just got back from barnes and nobles.  You'd think i'd have to finish a documentary by the end of the week or something. But no, i just keep going out to eat,  taking days of rest, hanging out at bookstores, sleeping for 14 hours on end. yep.  yep.   i'll get it done though. The close i come to the deadline, the  more confidence i have about it.   I was reading the complete Idiots guide to jewish culture and history.  I want to be a Jew now. Insofar as it doesn't conflict with my faith that Jesus Christ is the son of God and His atonement for sin has set us free from the law, i want to be a Jew. Gosh, now that I put it that way, i wonder how much I really CAN become more jewish.

       im at alladins in stoneridge plaza now, with my laptop. and headphones on. lookin' dumb. doesn't matter though. I feel transparent. I feel like i'm just here with my Father, learning about the history of the Jewish people through the music of Don potter. I just got the album "since the fall" from him,  If you've never heard anything from don potter, it's definitely  unique. I really strain to classify it.  But the spiritual side of it, and the biblical story is unique and amazing.  I'm starting to get serious about my documentary about the question of anti-semitism. Looking at support and financing.  The Flight thing is wrapping up here, hopefully by monday.  Allen, the director, is getting an interview with the wright brothers great niece amanda wright-lane. I should be getting it on saturday, should i break the shabbat? i asked that same question last week until it came and i was crippled in repentance of sin so much that there was no OTHER answer than yes, of course. I suspect that i will not bend this sabbath either. I have found tremendous blessing in it's observation.   I once heard a historian speaking about the Jewish people many years ago and their continual existence as a people in the world.  His attribution of that phenomena was their observation of the  sabbath. As obtuse of an answer as that is, i find myself in similar obtuse agreement with it.   I mean, lets just think about it for a moment. Things in the kingdom of God are almost always backward at some level or another.  Like a Savior who dies in order to save. Like giving away your  money to allow Gods blessing. Like confession even, bringing about richer character.

       Horribly introspective this morning. Sometimes I wonder why God lets  my deceitful bones remain on this earth. Those same times i wish He would bring judgment on my wicked heart, at least so i have the chance of living a life of righteousness.   The shame i feel doesn't come from doing bad things. It comes from being exposed for those things and thus revealing to everyone what impurity remains in me despite my hardest attempt to manage that perception.  Sometimes i play dumb and wonder why i am "being overlooked" for various leadership rolls or whathaveyou. But let's get down to brass tax. I wouldn't  want me as a leader. I'm still way too flaky. Which is funny, because it would seem like i'm at one of the most stable points in my life.   It's like as soon as you get comfortable with something, God kicks out one of the supports that really shouldn't be supporting you in the first place.

       friday 2:04 am Saw matrix revolutions with mark and sara snow tonight in IMAX format.  sorry, not into it.  I really do appreciate the gospel parallels, but. . . i cant help but be reminded of the newer star trek tv stuff with all of the over-the-top post-collapse garb and VERY predictable dialogue. I kept wondering if what neo was doing at different points were parallels to the crucifiction.  Then the brothers made it blatantly and cinematographically clear when exactly that moment happened.   One of my most favorite parts of Jesus death was covered too. When satan stares at Jesus on the cross, dead, as He gives his life to save  a nation, the world, mankind; thinking he has won, Jesus is dead. Just then, completely subverting the idea of loss and victory, the Holy Spirit comes and explodes light into the heart of everyone who believes.  And now, millions of little Christ's running around everywhere.   Watch the movie, draw your own parallels. The consensus is that the Brothers are more dualistic than biblical christianity. That good and evil are equally powerful.  That they are even 2 sides of the same coin. I don't even pretend to understand the problem of evil, but i believe that in the end, God holds ALL the cards.

       Visited the Drexel in Bexley last night for a screening of a documentary on dietrich bonhoffer. Some interesting questions were raised on the relativity of ethics even in the kingdom of God.   How can bonhoffer, a christian pastor, plot to murder anyone. And  was he ever completely settled in his own decision to do so?  Moral relativism is a slippery slope to say the least. History has proven Hitler to be one of the most maniacal regimes of our time, and yet so much of the church just folded into his ideology for a new germany. Humans are bent toward evil, so, in my mind, many jumps toward moral relativism in given situations are most likely motivated from evil, and wanting to withdraw from authority rather than benevolence.   If almost the whole german church can be duped by a man who confesses an ideological God (I admit, it did make me think of bush for a moment), then who's to say that I am not duping myself simply in a slightly different direction, by plotting to kill the man who does such things.   This answer keeps getting to be more of a cop out every time I use it. And in this situation i especially don't like what i am about to suggest. Yet, it seems that it all comes down to what God is leading His sheep (you know, the ones who ACTUALLY know His voice, and ACTUALLY follow Him) to do.   To be convinced in ones own mind that God is "on my side" is foolish and common. For a community to be convinced is slightly more dangerous and also comforting as you are not acting alone. For a nation, in it's own mind to be convinced that God is on their side almost certainly leads to war.  But you cant dismantle an argument based on its possible dangerous effects or abuses.   I don't know if I agree with what Bonhoffer was doing in his attempt to assassinate Hitler. But I'm not sure that bonhofffer agreed with himself half the time either. I sure wouldn't want to see a few people in my homegroup (or lets be honest, i would feel  uncomfortable with myself absolutely) taking liberties in proportion to assassination  based on what either myself or my immediate community or my nation believed.   On a related note, tonight i think i'm teaching a good old fashioned message of repentance at homegroup. Motivated by virtue that we need time to confess our sins to God and one another that we can receive His spirit and that He can dwell within us more fully and we can dwell together more fully.

       Long night.  Sunday nap was nice, then Church (joshua house this time). I guess I just dont understand church staff methodologies. After being in a small church plant with a young leader and seeing some of his control issues being dealt with, you wouldent think the same thing would manifest in such a large body of believers with suposedy more seasoned and accountable ministry staff.

       this morning was phenominal.  I woke up earily and went to visit christian assembly on karl rd.  Hannah was leading the worship watch, which is basically a half hour of spontanious scripture, prayers and worship woven together as people enter. I started crying then, and ended much later. The God I serve is so mercifull to me. Always extending grace.   I've felt at several points in my life that i was just not going to be able to follow the calling that God had for my life, because i was  simply too far down the path of mediocraty. My theory was that it was going to take something major to jossel me out of my day-to-day mindset and follow Jesus with total abandon as I did when i first  started. All the while, I know the kind of life i do not want, the life i'm living now. But, for some reason He does not let me go.

       i had shabbat  last night at yvonne and karl peters home at the invitation of hannah osborne. The whole osborne family was in attendance sans chloe, away dancing up a storm in the Holy Land. A man named Ron from Christian Assembly was also there.   The ceremony was phenomenal. This was my first participation in a shabbat (sabbath) dinner ceremony. We blessed eachother in Hebrew and english, and prayed for one another. All week i had been looking forward to that evening, and in no way was it disappointing. After sitting and talking until just past 11pm  hannah and i went to the lennox theater to see "lost in translation"  with Bill Murry and that other girl from "Ghost World" (don't bother with Ghost World).  Mark Snow told me I would leave LIT depressed, I told him whenever people tell me that, it doesn't do anything. Yet, to my chagrin,  both hannah and i had absolutely left with a feeling of having been subverted into sadness.    After readapting to our repective environments, BUBBLE TEA (MOMO KTV and TEA STATION, by applebee's off olentangy is open till 4am on weekends! gotta love being on asian time, whatever that means)  So i took a sabbath today and did no work. I felt so much peace. So much blessing. I picked up my friend Nicole K to go to a home group bonfire hosted by a girl in our group who lives in marysville. The drive out was  definitely unexpected. After picking her up on campus, I shared with her some of the bread that was baked for me by Hannah's mom for shabbat.   The Holy Spirit then had some work to do in the car. Nicole started laughing and crying for no apparent reason. The Lord was lifting burdens and releasing her from worry. It was a wonderful thing to sit and drive in the presence of.   I guess Todd Hunter always says something like, there is no christianity apart from the regular manifestation of the Holy Spirit. For a long time, i went without seeing anything at the village vineyard. When spiritual people stop seeing transformative things happen by the Holy Spirit, I think there's a temptation to substitute ironic life events like parking spots and a good deal on a new car for an actual powerful working of the Holy Spirit in peoples lives.  All that to say, what i've been saying for 8 months now, "It's good to be back."  Also went to gallery hop tonight. Ran into my friends mike and sue burkett. wonderfull seeing them. It seems as if so much has happened today to write about. Hannah hauer's  mother asked me if i would be interested in preaching at their church in marysville! I dont  know that i've ever been asked to perform such an honorable task. I'll ask to teach at homegroup (which i will be doing this wed. too) but never asked to preach at a church.  I was afraid she may have gotten the wrong guy.  I dont know, but after years of feeling overlooked, or maybe just months, it just seems  weird to actually be asked to do something like that. we're both going to pray about  it, but i am definitely interested. Blessed Is the Lord, God of Abraham, Isach and Jacob.

        i was right, no sleep  i expected as much. These last 11 hours have been. . .  excruciatingly expectant. I haven't been this. . . disheveled  (well, my hair has, debatably) since i was 8 and going to kings island the next day. Ahh the struggle to be balanced.   I think I'm going to take a walk. She'll be here in about an hour. I'm sweating profusely. totally gross.

        heart palpitations  It's been about a half hour since i got off the phone with  urlLink her  and my heart's pattern continues to escalate into the quick thumps that accompany butterflies.  She's picking me up tomorrow and we're heading to Muncie, IN for new years eve with her friends. I have yet to see her face in person, as she has yet to see mine, but we've both seen pictures of each-other via the internet.   Seems completely out of the blue. A development that came  from a comment posted by JNeds-Fox  that i should check out the blog of an acquaintance of his for similar thoughts on injustice.   Looking back at the last 2 days has been amazing. We spent a total of 8 hours monday night corresponding between 4 hours on instant messenger and 4 hours on the phone.   I am definitely infatuated, I definitely feel the butterflies, and from where i stand with Jesus, I really can say I feel His pleasure and blessing looking down on this.   From what i can tell, Amy seems to be a great match. A fellow vineyard church planter with a heart for international justice, a love for  urlLink good radio , a  urlLink drop dead gorgeous smile  , a matching wit and intellect and a shared direction and perspective on so many other things, she also writes amazingly and has the most beautiful voice.   So, there it goes. hopefully I'll actually get some sleep tonight. I feel both so  filled with excitement and energized by the Holy Spirit.    i wept  My duct taped bible with the ripped up back now falls directly open to Isaiah 58 (true fasting). As i sat here on my bed tonight, i couldn't help  but weep as i sensed the truth of the call to:   "Shout it aloud, do not hold back Raise your voice like a trumpet."   I am one who, no matter how much i don't understand God, must believe that He has called me to be one who declares his truth, whenever and wherever (a task at which i am currently abhorrent).   I am a man who is to go and  "loose the chains of injustice" . No matter how much i get distracted by life and work and music,  I don't ever have to come back to God and explain where I've been.   I don't ever have to justify my actions, or make excuses. I just have to come and be loved. And ALL those excuses seem so shallow. All those reasons i was gone seem so worthless. And all i have, is to cry and accept the tears that renew a call of a life lived close to Him

        to whom it may concern  i caught the garter at the wedding friday.  I'm still a little giddy about it. well, maybe i'm giddy about that, or maybe something else. . .    under the tuscan sky  I'm generally up for seeing films based  on books even if it doesn't look like they will appeal to me. The premise of this film is an american tourist  who buys an italian villa on a whim after her divorce.   I have to say, i'd be game for something like that. It was romanticized in the movie, obviously, but what is keeping  me from buying a little place in a developing nation and gathering a little community around me. it'd be great.    ignoring the movie  i'd actually like to buy a house in columbus in the next year.  i don't know why. It just makes sense from a investment standpoint. I don't even want to settle down in the proper sense of the word. It'd just be nice. . . smart, maybe too. . .    blogging and dating  it seems as if the medium of the online journal is a revolutionary way to get to know someone.  I'll ask the questions of false intimacy later. . .   But, until now, self disclosure was a luxury only afforded to the published, the famous, rock musicians, politicians,  and other entertainment figures. Now, it seems, life can be lived and disclosed for the starving eyes of an onlooking populous of detached individuals by anyone with an internet connection. This makes the process of "getting to know someone"  tremendously easier.

        my mom is awesome  THE FOLLOWING IS A RESPONSE THE THE LAST POST FROM:MY MOM too late, I read it. Dan, I never ever would give you a gift with strings attached. I dont know about the others on your dads side, but I never meant for the christmas money I gave you to cause you stress or guilt in any way. I did not specify what you were to do with it. It was simply my gift to you, thats all. I love you and wanted you to have it.  For you to want to give the money away to charity, to help the kids in cambodia, or any other place in the world, is I think the sweetest, kindest thing I have heard in a long time. What better way to express your love for God and celebrate Christmas in the true manner that it should be, by giving to someone in need.  I think you are struggling with some life decisions as we all do. Trying to make the right decisions, trying to keep balance in your life.  I totally understand. If you want to keep the money for yourself thats o.k. too. Just dont cause yourself stress over it. Its just stuff.  Every mother should have a son as wonderful and caring as you. I am proud to be your mother. Your heart is in the right place!  Hugs, mom

        pissing my family off  dad, grandma, mom, dont read this:   I don't know what to do with my christmas money.  I was advised to spend it on something for myself.  A keyboard, computer stuff maybe. But i guess I'm just having trouble justifying the purchases. I can't even go out to dinner recently without thinking of the 2 children's lives i can save by providing medication so that they won't contract HIV from their mothers. i dont pretend to know where to draw the line. i'll flash back to cambodia:      Date: Tue Mar 04, 2003  John and I went to the FCC last night after a day of meetings and hanging out with the college students at our student center. FCC stands for Foreign Corospondence Club. A ritzy, riverside three story restaurant overlooking the streetkids and beggars of the city. I would love to say that we did something wonderfully noble and whipped the whole crowd into a frenzied of giving that poured into the streets. Unfortunately, we just ate pizza and dialogued about our responsibility to the poor in the world.  "how can one justify luxury when they can see people dying of easily curable diseases that only take a few dollars in medication to alleviate?"  "How much of my money is really to be spent on myself in the context of maintaining my own lavish western lifestyle?"  I can't even begin to address the depth of these questions. But being here and seeing things makes one think about their roll in this world. I would not want to deprive these valuable questions from you as i strive to share the balance of my expierence here in Cambodia.     Questions yet unanswered.  I feel like this is a big decision in my life. What kind of man am I going to be.  A man who is always "looking out for number one" or a man who does something about the injustice he sees around him.   I know I'm just a kid, and everyone goes through these idealistic, "changing the world" phases. I am just not totally convinced I'm not going to be one of those freaks who never grows out of the phase and is constantly giving his money to those who need it more than he does.   I think the other thing that gets me is that, in my current financial state, I am  unable to completely and consistently support myself. The stretch lies between school and insurance mostly.   so why don't i just save the money for myself. . .  i dont know. the kids are still dying.  i just hate to piss of grandma by giving the money she gave me away, and likewise dad, mom, uncle. . . and so-forth.   but this is who i am unfortunately. At least at this point in my life I'm unable to turn away from the poverty and disease i see. . .

        this is spinal tap  I finally got caught up on the first film in the christopher guest mocu-mentaries this evening.  The bonus material just keeps on rolling.  "will it ever stop? YO, i dont know."   TODAYS VALUE TIP:  no need to visit blockbuster before 9pm. the main library will hook you up free.  PLUS, a huge selection of documentary  and educational films that you want to watch anyway.   LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE LIBRARY!   so this is christmas...  i dont know if its the lack of decorations up around my home. If it's the lack of time in peace, rest. the slight illness thats fallen  upon me but christmas just isn't the magical wonderland that it is on TV. maybe i havent been around Easton enough. BTW. it's the only shopping mall i care to deify with an initial capitol.    bob dylan  i received this completely undeserved compliment from mikeG, and thusly had to prove myself worthy of such a statement.     sort of see you as a songwriter in the  vein of Bob Dylan. keep it up.    for those who didn't see the correlation before (believe me, myself included), this should  sufficiently bridge the gap. I still think mike's on crack, but i wanted to hit the pipe with him before i let his comment traverse down  into obscurity through my inbox.   heres to Mr. Dyan  urlLink barracks      remember kids  to the extreme i'll rock a mic like a vandal, light up the stage and wax a chump like a candle.

        urlLink  : "Christians affected by this view will have the idea that any kind of cultural involvement (particularly in the arts) is unimportant or somehow a distraction. Many young Christians have been advised that they should not go into fields like art, music, literature, painting, and drama because those are unimportant worldly pursuits."   We are made to feel that only if what we are doing has an immediate evangelistic value is it of some use. Or, that only if it has some spiritual purpose will it have value. yes yes yes... NO NO NO. . .

       submitted via e-mail from a friend as a response the previous post:  "I would love the arts to be revived, but not at the cost of kids being left on the street when they could be fed and taught and loved in a christian orphanage."   i really like that.  actually, i question the premise that the arts need to be 'revived'. it seems to me that if you're an artist, just go on ahead and worship the living God thru your medium! it sometimes comes off like folks want art to be revived so that they can display their work. which is all great and wonderful and creative, but not at all the point of church, in my mind. now, i'm all for using creativity and beauty in a church experience (the building and the worship and teaching)... but the whole point of that is to further illuminate the Father, Son and Spirit. (i still pray that if we ever plant a church, we could buy an old catholic deal with real stained glass!)  so, i suppose my rather non-artist bent is toward releasing folks to worship God as they please. but i wholeheartedly agree with you: reviving the arts in the church doesn't come close to the fact that there are hungry people to feed and folks who don't know jesus and children who need loved and the least and the last and the lost. if in any way we can use the arts to meet those needs, i'm all for it. otherwise it'll remain on my backburner.  ----  every 14 seconds, an african child is orphaned by aids. forget the arts, i'm wondering if it is ethical to overpay for a cup of coffee at starbucks?? i don't hit the movies that often, but i do own far too many pair of shoes. talk about injustice... right in my own freaking closet. makes me sick...  i'm thinking that i'm going to boycott starbucks. not going to buy coffee or scones or soy-decaf lattes. i'm going to buy the cheap stuff in bulk, already ground maxwell house or something, and figure out how much money i'd have left over from not going for the good stuff. i'm not going to buy any shoes for the next six months. (it's pathetic that i want to say a year but am not sure i can hold out when summer hits... sometimes i just disgust myself.)  i'd love to pray for you sometime regarding a heart for justice. i think that you have to look for opportunities for your heart to be broken. we have to look at the things that disgust us, at the pictures of the dead in iraq and the graves full of mothers and babies in rwanda and we have to keep our eyes wide open until our hearts burst and we cry and cry and cry and then we won't be able to turn back, as long as we keep our eyes open. have you read 'the good news about injustice' by gary haugen? i think you'd really be moved.  ---  i've been reflecting on this whole blog thing. it's enticing, and i'm trying to figure out why... here's my theory: it's kind of like having a relaxing laid-back evening at your friends house, where lots of folks are around and you can just lay on the couch in your sweats together talking about life and love and theology and changing the world together... except for we're all too busy to hang out much anymore, so it's a virtual laid-back evening where we don't have to go to anyone's house or clean up our own... we can share our lives without so much effort. like, i haven't talked to chels. or jeff in ages and it was great to catch up on their blogs.  plus there's the deal that we've all got so much to say... so many dreams and grand ideas and we want to be heard, and a blog lets people be heard. no one would publish our books (yet) so we put them online and feel like we're able to air out our heads that are so full after crazy days full of the mundane and profound.  it all seems to stem from our great need to be known. i like that. i suppose the dangers of blogs (gossip, slander, false intimacy) are the same dangers that face in real face-to-face relationships. maybe i'll start one up... just for kicks!  all that to say, keep ranting!

        return of our king  The other night I popped open a hymnal MHoffman gave me from cedarville and wrote an adaptation of  a hymn called "lead us o king eternal".   the result is  urlLink this.     good pleasure  got in a "conversation" with someone the other night at a party regarding whether God the Father took pleasure in the death of His Son.   I think it's a pretty clear point to anyone who has ready Piper. The basis for the argument was Isaiah 53:10   "yet it was the Lords will to crush him and cause him to suffer"    an old testament prophecy referring to the coming messiah.  A translation of the hebrew word "will" there is "good pleasure".  However, the idea that the Father didn't experience pain in seeing His son suffer for the sins of man is also not a valid viewpoint.   I think it's safe to anthropomorphize God the Father to the extent that He has emotions for the son that would be similar to a good earthly father to his son. Not exactly, of course, because God is Holy and even the best earthly father will find corruption  in his emotions.   These two points: God taking "good pleasure" in the crushing and suffering of his son, and the difficult emotions that the Father experience watching His son suffer are not mutually exclusive ideas.   So while I'm tempted to play my "I'm a borderline postmodernist  Christian" card and say I believe both contradictory ideas can be held, these are not even contradictory ideas. The will of God being multifaceted and the emotions of God being likewise is not too far from the emotions of an earthy father who sends his daughter to a far away college, the good pleasure and the  pain exist intermingled.   It seems pretty simple to me. But it seems simple, because i don't try to understand the mind of God to a degree that may, in fact, be impossible for me, at least at this life-stage.    a related question from bob dylan   did judas iscariot have God on his side?  If it was Gods "good pleasure" and perfect will that the Christ suffer and be crushed, and the devil entered Judas' heart, prompting him to betray Jesus, and Satan's power is subordinate to God, then was God on Judas' side?  I guess i just don't know.     things i would look for in a woman if given the opportunity  I'll start this by saying that this comes on the heels of an nice stretch of single contentedness. It's been really nice. That doesn't mean i don't still have my "list" though. so here it goes.   A serious follower and lover of Jesus who is involved in a community of other believers.   someone who is growing in spiritual gifts, maturity and love.   Someone who is (at the very least) able to appreciate the arts.  stable (dont know that i can explain this one. . . )  someone who is respectful and not controlling ("not a nag")  someone who is a good fit intellectually, (i don't want to be dwarfed or bored.)  someone with a strong gift of encouragement  someone who is not caught up in the acquisition of things as a means to happiness     (one who understands giving to the poor in finances and life)  added bonuses but not necessities: women with happy sounding e-mail addresses natural beauty, not into glam.  race unimportant musically inclined  little / no school debt interested in women's ministry interested in global justice / missions  what do you think? is this list too specific, it's probably not too general. do you think one of you can find me one before christmas time?   kimberly is in town  on leave from the air force, one of my favorite people is back in columbus for the holidays, she wont stop raving about her new boyfriend. It's cute, but my infinite selfishness is  easily annoyed and made jealous. so....   music  someone asked me why my music wasn't as crazy as i was when i played live.   it's because i do it sitting on my bed between 3 and 5 am.  when will i learn that writing music is not being a  productive and contributing member of society.   For years i prayed to write songs. now it seems that the prayer is being answered. I love it. If for no other reason than i have something new to listen to.   I love listening to my own music. Its my favorite music.  If you write it, shouldn't it be your favorite? i never expected to completely gorge myself on my own writing once it was done, but, in fact, it is the case. seems self-indulgent. but i'm actually critiquing as i listen. trying to get better. listening for what works and what doesn't.    what do i even call this?  Ok, there's this little pet theory i have. I first surfaced when i was listening to 88.1 FM  CDR radio (cedarville's radio station) and they would have 15 second station advertisement spots where they would try to say as many doctrinal truths as they could string into a few sentences. For instance: "You're listening to CDR radio, where we believe that God became flesh leaving behind his heavenly majesty to be born into a stable growing up to be come a learned carpenters son and subsequently dying on the cross at the hands of the Pharisees and roman government for the sins of mankind and thusly abolishing the sacrificial systems in place by the religious law at the time. You're on the path."  Ok... ok. all that's true, but why is this modernist reduction of narrative into doctrinal sound-bytes assaulting me over the airwaves. What exactly is this proported to accomplish?  I don't have a gripe against CDR radio. But it illustrates a trend that has shaped the modern american church. This idea that everything must boil down to the gospel or it is worthless. And by the gospel, I  mean the reduction of the narrative of the coming of the kingdom of God into the 5 spiritual laws.   I'm afraid this ideology; that unless some form of these 5 laws as a message is driven home, the boardroom consensus is that the message was a waste of the resources alloted. This leaves artists in a bind. As artists, we're always trying to vie for resources. Cash, time, airplay, display; yet all of these things require capital, which is limited.   I find myself in an immovable predicament. The word of God says give to the poor, loose the chains of Injustice with the resources allotted to you.  Yet so many these days are trying to revive the arts in the church.   I would love the arts to be revived, but not at the cost of kids being left on the street when they could be fed and taught and loved in a christian orphanage.   This is where i have trouble understanding the idea of "Christian movies". In an article recently referenced from Erik's blog, the author mentions that  after seeing a film, the viewer has just engaged in mankind's most expensive art form. I want to play the movie game too. I want to shoot films and teach subverted lessons on grace and the coming kingdom, but i JUST DONT SEE IT IN SCRIPTURE. I dont see the disproportionate resource drain when $4 will prevent a baby in africa from contracting HIV from their mother.   I've been wanting to use this line for a while.  AMERICA, YOU ARE BEING SERVED WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE CHARGES. Every time we misappropriate our resources, every time we purchase a luxury item and refuse to consider the dying, we are guilty of perpetuating class distinctions,  racial barriers, overlooking rape and human trafficking, and sanctioning murder.   I fall firmly on both sides of the argument. If we have limited resources alloted to the communication arts, then by all means, they should contain the information essential for informing someone how they can come into a relationship with God the Father through Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, it's all too often poor communication practice to drown an audience member with gobs of narrative information distilled down to 5 east points in order for them to respond to a broadcast call to salvation.   this is such a rant. Someone say something.

        am i dumb  or do you guys like playing the games that came on your cell phone too?   a new song  i tried not to write this week. i wrote a jingle last night,  tonight i wrote a song about a friend of mine, jim. really rough. short though, so its tolerable.    question from my inbox  "quick question: do you feel jaded by the church? sometimes you sound kind of cynical" -jp  i am the church, so, do i feel jaded by myself. absolutely. like why the hell can't i actually share the gospel or maybe why i can't even talk about outreach without feeling defensive and failing. My problem lay in myself.   As far as the rest of the people that make up the church that aren't failing, those people are just fine. I think without thinking about it, i portray a certain level of cynicism when relating to people who have been around the institution for a while. I just assume others have had their passions worn down, being processed by the system, being refused advancement they suspected was due them, any number of gripes i hear from old timers.   then someone like jeff cannel comes along and shows a young buck like myself who's trying to play cold and detached that truth and wisdom lay in blessing the church you are a part of and speaking lovely of the bride of christ, even if she appears a tad bruised at times and in various places.   I have to say, this was one undercurrent i felt in the culture of the village vineyard; every other church was screwing things up. And while that would never be stated in so many words, it was a common assumption that the greater church was in for a rude awakening when they realized that God was doing so much more than they are letting Him do.   It seems the tables were actually quite turned.   i think things have changed. at least i hope so. but that's enough of that.   so the answer to the question, i think, is this. I'm not really jaded, I'm just a people  pleaser, so i talk the language of those I'm speaking with, thinking i will find common ground. I guess some old timers aren't jaded, praise the Lord.

        future topics  in the near future i intend to cover the following topics briefly.  the blogging medium : is it creating intimacy or distance  and under what circumstances.   my time at the village vineyard church plant: what can be learned looking back.   aids in africa, or kids in cambodia: the consequences of being divided in your desire to be a means of providing some social justice.   what i learned at the rock and roll hall of fame.   indie rocker: to be or not to be  i am an easily encouraged individual. so when JNF posts to my blog that i should put my feelers out based on the strength of some of the songs posted on the songwriter site,  i actually makes me think that this is a possibility.   for a number of years i knew my weakness was song-writing. hanging out with jim zartman only proved to deepen my understanding of that weakness. But all the while i prayed that God would give me the gift of song-writing. for years i prayed this. I noted other talents as to keep my over-inflated ego filled with hot-air. e.g.. perhaps production was my main gifting, i can arrange and correct, but not compose, or i can play all these instruments so. . .   I lived with John Reuben for a year. I saw him on the road and off. It was that year that i realized i was not built for the road. For the lack of relationships at home, for the tiredness, the stresses of business, the constant self-promotion,  the constant battle of not believing your own self-promotion for humility sake, merch.,  ticket sales, fakeness, groupies. . . i just dont think i could take it.   But i have to admit, the allure of fame does make me forget about all the hardships i saw john endure. It's not even money. artists dont make money.  Real money is inherited, new money goes to businesspersons, the artist is given his cut. And even with the top percentage of successful artists, their income pales in comparison to the previously mentioned categories. Cash is such a tangent.  As if that was the only thing concerning me. I think my point is simply, dont become an artist for the money, become a musician because you want to throw away all relationships you have at home for a disenfranchised tires and usually penniless  existence as a nomad, entertaining people as they indulge in drink or prior to illicit sexual activity. What a life.   I'm not going to fool myself into thinking there's some kind of platform for Jesus on the indie rock circuit. personally, i just dont buy it. Not that i would judge any of my  friends who felt called to that. In fact i would probably encourage them in it. But of all who have ventured out, i haven't heard stories or seen the tremendous fruit you would think such a platform may yield. I have seen tired eyes, fallen lead singers, and even more discontent. i dont want that life.    the alternative  If i love performing and writing music, what are the alternatives to refusing the road?  playing columbus: just for fun, could be cool. real success would be illusive. writing and giving away music: on the web, maybe get hooked up with a publishing house. could be cool, but not satiate the performance  facet of the diamond. would not be able to really sell records either.   do something completely different. . . "every day, every day, every day's a fresh new day, with Downy"  "baby, baby, baby, buy a beamer"  i had to change the car name, the last time i put Lex%s in here thats all the g00gle banner ad search found for a month.  welcome to the age of laundry detergent.

        childlike  i was thinking how cool it would be to return to cedarville and rock out worship for an eve.   there was a time my freshman year, when the student activities association rented a tent for a worship night outside in the spring. It was amazing. one of the best worship times i was able to experience that whole year.  It seems that youth carries with it so much trust and idealism. I'm at the vantage point now where most see it slipping away for cynicism and humanism. Even a few years ago i felt more flexible, more willing to just go after certain things. I can even see it in my friends who are two or three years younger. extreme spontaneity. willingness to go wherever at the drop of a hat.   I dont quite understand what it means to be childlike about  faith. I am detached from "children" proper. i guess most may be in my life-stage. what is it like to trust?  i watched "it's a wonderful life" tonight. i think for the very first time. there was a moment when the father flips out and the kids ask mom if they can pray for him? it seems like something kids do naturally.   I dont know how to reach that state of childlikeness. i'm not around it to really understand it. but I CAN venture back to 7 years ago when jesus blood was still freshly running through my veins. when my willingness to follow seemed hard and fast.   Dont get me wrong. a lot of good has come in these "in between" years. a ton of the sharper edges has worn off (believe it or not) and i have become a lot more stable and emotionally secure (believe it or not) i would hope as well that i had become more kind, less judgmental, more concerned about others and a host of things.

        artificial community  i have been seeded with scepticism concerning the blogger medium. It definitly is a communication expirament. I found a new friend today who reads (hi-m) we have very intertwined circles yet have never met. I wonder how many people like this there are in my life, and how i can harvest them and use their body heat to fuel the AI robot cities of the future.   lattely i've been caught. i love meeting new people and making friends (usually) and dispite how poorly i keep up with certian people, i enjoy existing friendships,  but i'm not all together certian that i can maintain the kinds of relationships i want to.   This is just life though, right? I think most people get over their needyness at some point and learn to be contented in being alone and whatnot. something i can do from time to time and fain doing more frequently.   Maybe it seems different when you're married. Of course you want to close off, be at home. where it's safe a cozy. You have someone there who you can sit and just be with. built in company. I dont know if that gets old. but it seems easier to do than coming home to a freezing apartment with no food, tv or stereo and trying to pretend its fun.   But dont get me wrong. when Jesus is present (which is not just some kind of theological ascent) it lights up the place. Theres  prayer, joy, weeping. worship and a ton of things that go on in that solitude. but when my heart has taken off on a bit of a stroll to different territories (has anyone noticed the rediculious amount  of recorded material i have produced in the last week) my spiritual life pays a price.   now you know the real story.

I'm not complaining, rather noting that it is an eye-opening  experience.    the noise  it's like i have a spiritual thermometer that is relative directly to the whole garbage in / garbage out adage. movies   music   no solitude   no scripture = tired at first, then complaining in my brain, then cursing people out in my head, then usually falling into some sort of sin and repenting with tears and heartache.

        beer  barley's "barley wine" first had over a year ago with John and Jeremy is still a favorite.  "it's smooth and it's so sweet,  it's a tatste, that can't be beaten. "   recording  i got my little bedside rig up. laptop USB mixer, okay microphone and a multitrack program. I'm still just sketching, but what follows will prove to be  a tad more listen-able.    no, seriously   i feel like i haven't posted anything of any intellectual / spiritual significance  lately. so i'll try to correct that soon, like now.    leadership  i can't say i know a lot about leadership, but i had a conversation with john from my homegroup tonight about being balanced in the communication of a radical call. For instance, the situation is as follows: John wants people to pray for our homegroup so he made sign-up sheets and has called for 3 people a week for pray for a half hour a day at least for our group. for a few weeks people were picking it up, but the last week or two, we are starting to see recycling in the people offering to pray. (i myself was confronted on never volunteering)   My projection is that the call is intimidating people (for instance, me) who are barely comfortable spending a half hour a day with Jesus, let alone praying specifically for our home group that additional amount of time.   When you call people to something radical, you must respect the fact that they may not be ready for that spiritually, or God may just be working on them in a different area. Is this that puzzle piece thing you were telling me about so long ago E? I would love to hear some feedback. All i know is what i've been through and thats not a ton.    anti-semitism  i happen to be working with the FREAKING MAN,  john beshears. The following is an explanation of our project he has sent to a number of groups requesting help. please feel free not to read this section,  however, it does go over some of the specific topics we wish to cover.   Message:  Hello. My name is Jonathan Beshears. I am a research assistant for a documentary filmaker, Daniel Fox. He has done several films, including a recent documentary about Cambodia based on his experiences in a visit to that nation.   We are centered in Columbus, Ohio, and for our next project, we wanted to create a film about the historical roots of anti-semitism, as well as the reasons for its persistence today. We wanted to begin in biblical times with the persecutions of the Israelites by the Egyptians, Canaanites, Babylonians; later under the Romans, with the Destruction and scattering of the Jewish people. Continuing up until modern times, we would discuss the Medieval persecutions, the co-existence with Islam, Luther and Protestant anti-semitism, as well as some discussion of nazism, although we certainly could not begin to investigate the nazi period as thoroughly as the many other books and films which have focused their attention solely upon the Holocaust. Instead, we want to look to history in order that we may understand why anti-semitism persists today. Why does hatred of Jewish people persist, even amongst educated, rational people?  We want to investigate some of the modern anti-semitic movements, such as neo-nazism and so-called "Christian Identity", as well as the Islamic and Black Muslim anti-semitism.  	As far as the substance of the film, we would like to do a number of interviews with various sources. We would like to interview some history and Jewish studies professors to present their views about the history of anti-semitism. We would like to talk to people on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such as Israeli government officials, Palestinian officials, as well as people associated with some of the radical Islamic groups, such as Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. To get a religious perspective, we want to interview rabbis and christian scholars to get their opinions on anti-semitism, as well as the Israeli-Paleistinian conflict ("Does Israel have a right to the land based on the bible, should they simply expel the Palestinians, etc.).   We would like to speak with some of the members of the new hate groups,  such as "Christian Identity" to get an idea of why it is that they use Christianity  to support anti-semitism. Lastly we would like to speak with people from the ADL,  Southern Poverty Law Center, or other anti-hate groups to discuss how we can  win back the hearts and minds of anti-semites without becoming hateful and close-minded ourselves. If this sounds like something that you would be interested in supporting or offering assistance to, we would love to have your help.    This kids a genius.

        music details out of the way first.   downloaded christopher o'reily's album true love waits from the iTunes music store. All classical piano covers of your favorite radiohead tunes.    beer?  hops are definitely a strong component of sierra nevada's celebration ale. thus making my juvenile pallet regret the purchase of a whole 6 pack. someone  trade me for a stout?    depression and admission  tonight i made myself go to my small group. I woke up at 3pm after going to bed at 4am. i felt very depressed for no reason and sometimes being around any group of people multiplies the depression.  my heavy eyes tell a story that i am tired, that i feel too weird for everyone. for some reason my struggle with rejection has reared it's ugly head of late again.   I was in one of those positions personally where i find myself for the  moment, immovably emotionally tortured for no apparent reason. sometimes it lasts minutes, sometimes an hour. I feel very far from accepting the love that God has for me.   I have really simple answers to these woes.  1. i've been listening increasingly to secular music.  2. i have not been reading much of the bible.  and with that, i slide down the spiral of insecurity, selfishness, etc. etc.   it's frustrating.  there are a million things i could complain about right now. how everyone i know is smarter and more stable than me, how i am  consistently the weakest point in all of my relationships with others.   i really, really want to grow up.  someone help.  jesus?

       someone explain why after 4 cups of coffee today i am still doggedly tired.  is it because i was singing along to  urlLink radiohead  all afternoon?  either way,  this week consists of the following:    making sure i don't flunk out of my science or soc. classes.  finishing a video for church praying that i get paid the last installment for "flight" preparing to shoot the wedding friday night.  oh, and if i get some extra time i'll record some songs   i've been writing. i've filled up a side of a tape with stuff now that no one has heard. so i'll sift through that and post it on the songwriter forum if i get the chance.   mom asked me what i want for christmas,  candles? and then a bunch of really expensive  equipment. that's how it's always been though.  so much for you  urlLink purists  out there.    H8  johnathan beshears and i are starting research on funding and support for the documentary about anti-semitism.   i've never been one to actually come to the table without pre-concieved conclusions about an idea. (perhaps that why my intellect seems capped at a certain level.)  I have definitely felt that the point of doing this project, who's basic question is, "why have people throughout history hated the jews?" is to point out that the jews are notedly more persecuted than any  other people consistently throughout history.   I spoke with a guy from the bruderhoff the other day(a closed network of self-sustaining christian communities) who happened to be Jewish as well. His take was that Jews have not been persecuted more than other people groups. That is a view that, as elementary as it seems, i have not encounter yet in my prelim talks. I guess that's an assumption i should throw out before i start this thing too.   I'm a fairly post-modern chap, not hardcore, but i think there are certain corrections to be embraced, and the first one is to admit that i am not going to come to this, or  any project, without certain bias. But I don't think it means i shouldn't try, at least a little to put those things aside. If one of the goals for this documentary film is to take the viewer on a journey through asking and answering these questions about unequal hate and racism, (and it is) then how much more should it accomplish that goal, if I too am sincerely on that journey with them and not just imposing my faux journey through film on them including what i want to include and concluding where i wish to conclude.

        from the convent  just got back "home"to cincy for the night.  Amy and i took a roadtrip to indianapolis  for our friend natalie's birthday. it was very nice. One thing about the conversation stood out to me, other than me feeling like some sort of neo-traditionalist conservative, and that was the following question.  SUPPOSITION: a homeless man, kicked around his whole life, abandoned, unloved, unwanted, contracts HIV and finds himself living out his last days in a  hospice with only strangers to look after him.   doomed to hell after a life of torment? enough to cause the care takers to seriously question the goodness of the Almighty.   Q: Can a person have MORE compassion than God Himself?   I would say, of course not, thats an absurdity since God is the creator of love and compassion and all true love and compassion exist in Him and flow from Him.   I don't blame the mans utterly pittiful life on God.  He has given us quite a bit of leash to ruin this  world and most of the lives in it, simply with our  selfish drives and human power. It is harder to imagine that transition though, from a tortured life into death filled with eternal damnation and hellfire.   If only he has said the "MAGIC WORDS" that little  prayer. the "forgive my sin" or "Jesus, come into my heart",  God would wipe it all away and meet Him at the gates of heaven with open arms.   but no.   and so, last i checked, the approved orthodoxy relegates this man to slip into hell, unnoticed, uncared for, unlove, an "object of wrath" who's punishment has finally come due.   who is in?  who is out?  why?

        the year of the monkey, AGAIN!  if i'm not mistaken, the year of my birth was also the year of the monkey.   heres a gratifying update on the weekend: Amy Joy got here friday at about 6pm fighting through the snow. we went to estrada on king.   they had a little candle lit for us at the table and everything. it was very nice. after a relaxing dinner, we ventured out into the snow for aaron maccaughy's sheldon marsh show at barrister hall.   Got to see, chris and chelsea there (even though amy was staying with them, it was nice to run into them) as well as david andre and his girlfriend, aarons sister bekah maccaughy.   after the show it was back to chris and chelsea's for some chatting, (see chelsea's fotopage) and  the big lebowski .  2 white roses in amy's guest room awakened her into saturday with assurance of purity and commitment.    fade to black ,  open on wide shot of north market with  a clear view of braddok's dinner sign in frame   breakfast with chris and chelsea saturday morning at braddoks, the food was positively amazing.  Emmerson was with the elder kay's giving them an evening and morning of rest that was much deserved.    stop the film please   blah blah blah. . . i'm a tad too emotional to start recounting events, plus i'll use erik's excuse from last week. It's 2:00am. But it's always 2 am here.  it's never NOT 2 am. I'm not afraid to stream my  consciousness, but it's a kernel dump, i've tried before. maybe i'll save it for the end  today was was a nice reminder of how easily  discouraged I can be. yesterday (sunday) amy and i spent the afternoon and evening with mike, sue and justin.   No only was the time full of theological banter from which i identify with  urlLink justin's  ache's, but it was time dripping with wise anecdotal  stories of life's joys and pitfalls.   Rarely do stories move me, yet i was in tears at the simple narrative of Jesus' redemption of their lives.   i think the bottom line is that i love affirmation and can take it in with an open heart. But, that same open heart is young in learning how to strain out good from bad.   I want to love wisdom, I do love wisdom. But I'm not always sure what wisdom is. I'm pretty sure it's not ALWAYS anything, but it seems it's usually difficult  at the outset, balanced, selfless, God-centered, patient, practical, cloaked and morphable, yet timeless and sturdy, just out of reach  Matt Hoffman is such a good guy.   we were talking a lot tonight about how to better honor our women by understanding our rolls as brother and protector of purity.  let's just say i have about zero respect for Amy's last boyfriend. i fear if i ever have a run in with him i will be unable to show the grace and compassion of Jesus to him.   I can't imagine someone who has never met  me disliking me as i dislike this man. My contempt for his character is alone enough motivation for me to treat Amy  with ABSOLUTE respect and purity. All that asside, I think I really am starting to fall in love with this woman.   we've taken up the practice of verbally blessing eachother with our words. committing to protect her purity and looking  her in the eye as i do so at least once a sitting has profound consequences on my conscience as i am tempted to push boundaries.    cheese has never gone with chicken, just like bone thugs and harmony should have never covered a phil collins song.  "we're all out of collins mix" i wonder if i threw away those mixers jake gave me 3 years ago that never worked.   is phil collins really a superstar? i always thought stardom was star-em meaning it was how the stars got started. it worked until i was like 15 in my mind.  i also though miscellaneous was the tacky fashion of some ambiguously committed star name Miss Elanious. That worked in my mind until i was about 9.  my computer almost broke today.  it was trippy. i think i was passed some bad ram. or maybe i just had "mouse trails" turned on.  if there was such a thing on the mac.   and 2 coversations today about why mac's dont have a right mouse button. i will stay up until i dont work anymore. maybe i should just stay up all night.   that would be great!  great like a tiger.   its already 3:41am as the cars say "I LIKE THE NIGHT LIFE BABY"  64 king is the bomb place to hang out.

       Amy and I just got back from an amazing and exhausting day. I have not yet had a moment to myself since friday afternoon.  It's not a huge deal, but compound that by several nights of little sleep, and several shifts in people and place and it's  probably closer to what a normal life is like.   I look forward to sweet sleep now. 2:22 am, and "hey ya" and "12:51" have been in my head all day.   Led worship tonight for the middle schoolers. practice was rough, but predictably, the actual worship session, i felt, went well. That's sometimes far more relative depending on what criteria one is judging by. Can you hear your vocals? Are there more than 10 kids in the room? Does it look like anyone is following or experiencing anything?  I think the point i wanted to make is this. I am so inextricably tied to performance that it's hard for me most of the time to also have a worthwhile worship experience while I'm leading the music. Even when it looks like I'm really effected,  it's more just me WANTING to be effected.   Tonight, for instance, If i were alone playing music for God,  there would have been a point where i would have started weeping, put my guitar down and curled up in a ball and prayed. But i cant very well do that with a band full of  people looking to me for direction, and even worse, a room full of already insecure, reluctant pre-teens. That seems to me to be irresponsible leading.   Mike Burkett brought up the point today that "the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet." Meaning even though one may be moved in a direction of weeping and great emotional depth, the way they respond to that moving when in a public setting is subject to their own will.   I guess this was central in the debate over the Toronto Blessing in the early 90's. As the renewal was happening, was some of the behavior a "manifestation" of the Holy Spirit's presence, or a  human reaction to the Spirits presence (extreme joyfulness, grittiness,  silliness).   I'm all for expressions of joy and even silliness and much of the range of human emotion in the presence of God in the context of a public meeting, but again, the disagreement centered around whether these things should be "controlled" or "pastured" or just left to be, for better or worse.  There i go, delivering the hits, jumping from one topic to the next without completely finishing a thought.

        going to the moon?  I'm listening to  urlLink Talk of the Nation: Science Friday   A woman caller asked the obvious question: "Why are we spending so much to go into space,  when there are so many needs with the people on Earth?"  After the agitation settled among the scientist panelists (being so insulted that someone would contest technological progress!) the answer seemed to be this;    there is room to spend on need, and vision. The two are not mutually exclusive.    Is that answer adequate? What is vision? Going into space? The other option, need, is clearly legitimate.  Is it fair to single out the Space Program? What about Christian movies? Both represent a resource drain, vision, moving into new territory all while other needs are not being met. The major difference here is that one necessitates judgment on a general  governmental ethical platform, while the other must succumb to the ethical directives of Christ.   NOW which vision makes less sense? making christian  movies, or sending someone into space?

        notes?  yeah, if you can make any sense out of those, more power to you. I'd like to talk at some point about  these things, but honestly, there are things that i have learned by being around vineyard central these last 2 weeks that are affecting me more.    hospitality  for instance. hospitality without expectation changes lives. being at kevin and tracy rains and seeing their willingness to give and acceptance of me, makes me want to turn my future around and arrange it so that i am set up to do the same thing.    intentionally blurry denominational lines  seeing people gather around a desire to love Jesus together and live out the Bible, regardless of background or divisive doctrine.   this goes with the idea of rejecting the old "protest-antism". it seems that this nomenclature has, with it, brought an idea that we fundamentally define ourselves by who we are not. And not only that we have, as modern evangelicals, protested to move from the Catholic Church as Luther did, but that we protest every stream of doctrine and let it birth schism and division; even if that doctrine is secondary or tertiary to the core understanding of the Gospel.   it makes me weary of people who are planning on planting churches with strong denominational ties. It seems like there was a time (typically post- reformation) when assertion of doctrine as a primary  means of discerning who you are going to fellowship  with was the norm.   It seems as if a new criteria based on practice is developing. Time will tell if this is a reactionary  movement, but methinks that it is such a slow and deliberate move into areas which are  uncomfortable already, that it doesn't seems like a reactionary mentality.    amy  things keep getting better. we had a great time with tawd and sharon on sunday night, and a great official-like date saturday night at pomodories pizza in cincinnati. It was an amazing time of staring at each other for hours googlie-eyed.   this girl is amazing.

        SAT MORNING:  Brian Mclearon   MONASTIC MISSIONAL URBAN cATHOLIC COMMUNITY  A monastic community seeks to integrate spirituality into daily life.  It is building our lives around shared spiritual practices.   missional- concerned about what is happening in our world.   Os Guinness "Most evangelicals dont know what the gospel is" for Jesus the gospel is: the kingdom of God is at hand.   to be faithful to christ is a postmodern world is to be post-protestant we've done Protestantism for 500 years, lets just be christian  experiencing community is like going to epcot center to experience norway if you want community, you get the joy and the crap together,  (40 below, 16 hours of darkness)  so love in community takes on a different form (patience, faithfulness)     INTERACTIVE QUESTION  WHICH OF THESE 5 WORDS CAPTURE YOUR ATTENTION MOST  (MONASTIC MISSIONAL URBAN cATHOLIC COMMUNITY)    GROUP ANSWERS:    URBAN: an experience of walking everywhere, seeing people on the street.   a lot of us like the idea of real community, but we don't like the idea of dealing with the reality of others (and our own) baggage  at what point do the differences in "loving God and loving our neighbor" move from the periphery to the primary and therefore require protest against?   --- many people in the small group movement resonate with the resource drain on public worship. the tendency is to swing and not have public meetings.   you increase your chances on experiencing MONASTIC MISSIONAL URBAN cATHOLIC COMMUNITY if you take the pressure off trying to be a one-stop shop.    SAT, LATE MORNING ROUNDTABLE:   joe meyer   4 catagories of relationship, sociologically: public              social            personal              intimate  not neglecting the means of social and public relationship in bringing people to christ.

        mayhem:   FRI NIGHT: brian McClaren  wendell berry's idea "individuals = communities = public"  publics work through media promoting individual self-interests.  moving from community oriented, tribal groups, where accountability is built in. morals are learned and sin is know in the community.    2 paths:  1. building christian community: you know, house church and whatnot.  2. building outside community: neighborhoods, community center (politics?)  a CHRISTIAN public working against christian community.  christian media represent a different "public".   greet one another with a holy kiss: breaking class, racial and other barriers with a greeting. acknowledging that in the kingdom of God, the least has the greatest.   "if we love the idea of community, whenever a person comes along who gets in the way of that ideal, we will begin to hate that person"      (eg.the person that talks too much in group, they pose theological questioning (gay christians)   INTERACTIVE QUESTION  what's the difference between emphasizing community and emphasizing loving one another?   GROUP ANSWERS:    community can become about me and my needs, loving one another is always about someone else  community itself can become a smaller public  community of a large church feels cold. A crisis situation motivated love and warmth.  wanting to see your community become a movement becomes an idol and stumbling block to loving other people  "love" is a mask that we wear in church settings? what about "tough love"  love carries a sense of long term commitment.   it doesn't matter if you go from a big church to a small house,  if there's not love, nothing has changed  communities that love, and love is communal = you can love without being in community, but you cant be a community without love.   ------- individuals need care, but the community creates a new entity  which also needs care (eg. 3 parties in a marriage, the husband, the wife, and the marriage)  caring for the community requires care for the individual,  (eg. jesus getting away to pray and have solitude)

        bloody computer chess  it always beats me. always. dwarfing what  i can muster of an intellect. shaming me. proving once and for all that this handy dandy chunk of silicon is not only smarter than me, but NOT my friend.   Thank you, Jack-ass computer, for proving that I am a peon.   i will commemorate our relationship with a poem.    tie-book  by: daniel fox    you played music, that i like.  shining bright, like lightning in the night.  you were so true, and oh so fast i prayed that you would be the one to break last.   your screen i fixed one time already.  and i look to you before i go to beddy.   you fill my life with people and smarts and on you, oh brain, do i carry out the arts.   i write on your keys, and touch on your pad and how very unfortunate that you've made me so mad.   for now our relationship must come to an end.  i'm afraid apple care, this wound, will not mend.  i don't thank you, rectangle of color and light for offering pornography late into the night.   but my days of refusal are fading so fast.  for today, your pop-up windows will land you in the trash.   i'm sorry for all of the backups forgotten but data corruption is just not as rotten  as the humiliation that you bring to my life that last chess game did it, where is my knife.      mayhem  i will be in cincinnati this weekend at vineyard central for a church planting conference entitled  urlLink mayhem.   I have become more excited about this as i hear more about it.   I kinda chucked the whole house-church model into the "unimportant things" pile when i came back to vineyard columbus. I suspect most people attending this conference would agree that a new  model is no place to stand on. Jesus is. But, that said, I think i have had enough distance from the emotional baggage i took on at the village vineyard to think about these things again clearly and welcome new ideas again into my concept of church. I really hope that this does not stir a new wave of discontent for my own body of believers. I really am not about changing churches or small groups all the time. That seems a whole lot less conducive to community than changing the format.   So, for all of you amazing people who are unable to make it down this weekend, i will take good notes and post them for your consumption. Yes, as a matter of  fact, i think that probably is my roll this weekend.

        an intense and wonderful evening  amy joy drove up from cincy tonight to spend some time with my home group, then we hung out with mark and sara snow and went for a walk and to cup of joe, not necc. in that order.   mark and sara are dear friends. been through a lot with mark, from being roommates to doing church plants,  to him stealing my fan one hot summer night at N. 4th st.  Sara, i think, needed a little time to adjust to my bombastic and provocational interpersonal style. i've a lot of respect for the both of them.   also took some time to talk with e today. it was very affirming  and encouraging. thanks e. john too had a lot of good things to say throughout the day.   it was a struggle at homegroup tonight. i was feeling really awkward and there weren't many people there either. i get easily discouraged when stuff isn't great. there was so much insecurity in that group and it was obvious to amy too. there's a trade off i didn't see when i committed to this home group. We are very young, so i'll be able to offer my gifts, but the downside is, there's no one to pour wisdom and experience into me. If this is going to be the place church really happens, then we need wisdom, age, accountability, community and all those  other fun things to take place here. I really wonder what the boomer church moms and dads are thinking now. Are they even sensing any call to come along side us kids and mentor. If they are, is it a matter of being obedient to that call. Do people feel ill equipped, insecure, afraid of making new relationships with people unlike themselves, out of time for others? i have only encountered a few folks who really value this, and it's SO needed. if you're a boomer, and you love Jesus, even a little. comment and help us kids understand why all we have to hang onto is eachother.

        What's this crap???   so, it seems my idea of moving to cincinnati seems to have caused some controversy. DONT WORRY. What you can distill from that is simply that i would be willing to move  there if there was clear direction from God about it. You  could also distill that there are good things going on in the community of Vineyard Central. But, for God's sake (literally) stop it with the worrying already.    or did I miss something?  yeah, probably that whole thing about, "i'm just throwing this out as an idea." But that's OK. that's what this thing is for right? feedback.   depth of field: blog and fleamarket  Oh, and sharon, jeff cannell has your fax machine.

       So, it seems that the visit to Cincinnati this weekend has yielded a bit more than just an excellent time with  urlLink amy . I have inadvertently been privilaged to spend the weekend at "the brown house" with my new friends   urlLink  kevin and tracy rains  and their  urlLink faith community .  I am laying here on the queen sized bed on the second floor  journaling, at 2am.  So, here's the bottom line: I've completely lost it. I'm ready  to move here. My impulsivity has soared to new heights lately (i.e. random trips to cities i've never been to with a girl I had never met). I was thinking tonight about how absurd it would look to everyone i know in columbus to just pick up, and in the matter of a month or so, pack up necessary things and move to cincinnati.   I'd be tagged a total loon. Which, is fine, but i dont want to have a tag of foolishness accompany that. I signed up for a Stats 135 class at OSU this quarter, that's something i should actually try to complete.   There are lots of reasons i could stay in columbus. Most of those  reasons are people. But those are the same reasons i would want to move here.   i should note at this point, something my amigo and homegroup leader pointed out to me a few months back. I can tend to say things outlandish on a whim and sometimes i state these possibilities as  clear and definite directions when they may not be, in order to throw a line out for the purposes of gaining feedback. That said, the line has been thrown,  the wheels are turning and the process of feeling and thinking this thing out has begun.   By the way, to clear any question up at all, one would be about 85% correct if one stated that i would be moving to cincinnati just for Amy. I'm not going to comment on or correct that thought, but rather, just let it exist.   I also picture you, faithful blog reader, getting quickly tired of the drivel spouted and inspired by new romance. I will then strive to keep the details to a minimum  for the sake of wisdom, jeff cannell, and this concept of privacy people think i should maintain. Not that anyone has said anything bad, but i figure i'll at least attempt to fight the impulse to feed the voyeurism in my "readership". Let's fight to keep reality TV shows on TV where they belong. RIGHT? can i get a WHOOP WHOOP? oK then.    killing birds with stone  this blog thing, when in a decently motivated hand seems to have the potential for great good. I will now compose a list of what I feel these things are:   providing a venue for the half-disciplined to consistently journal.    i journal is seasons, prayers, thoughts, events, etc. . . , and sometimes those seasons run dry for several months. The idea that an audience composed of friends (or anyone really) is reading it, provides us performance oriented folk with reason to get off our respective tushes and make writing.     getting consistent and comfortable with confession   one may find room here to practice self disclosure on any number of levels. This could lead to feeling more comfortable being open and honest in person.    to know and be known   whether or not anyone reads what you write, it provides an outlet to be listened to. There is commonality in the human desire to be known, this may supplement the process of practicing that desire face to face with people.     dissemination of propaganda   If you're a major thinker in a particular movement, and yet humble enough not to recognize it and sign a book deal with a publisher, the online journal format allows you to regularly broadcast your thoughts to devoted followers.     keeping in touch with friends you may not otherwise see   self explanitory    small ideas become important   now, small insights that come through the day can be shared for what they are and appreciated by a number of people for the glimpse of truth that they expose.    you can meet hot chicks    urlLink case in point       stuff sharon bell needs  if you have any of these items and are looking to simplify your life by selling them or giving them,  please let me know.    scanner fax machine old version of painter software ("fractal design painter") WACOM tablet copier    tawd and sharon are moving to columbus soon and are also looking for a spacious home in the north campus / south clintonville area. drop a comment if you know of any place.

        i changed my header  to reflect the resurgence of the 80's in 2004, i have changed my header. happy new year.    when you work hard, you forget what just happened  The last day and evening seems to have not existed in my short term memory. Thats almost a promise that it wont exist in my long term either.   the rubber meets the road  or  you mean ANYONE can just read this stuff  jeff cannell is concerned about "guarding my heart" or maybe more,  "tossing my pearls before swine" on this online journal.  Self-disclosure is one thing, broadcasting a reality-show in real-time hypertext adventure format is another.   I have always found beating people to an honest or self-deprecating punch-line about myself is a decent defense mechanism. It seems the result of such actions is that people either feel like you already know you're problems and don't need to tell you again, or some other reasons i don't  care to socio-analize at this moment. Because of that I think i find it much  easier to communicate to a general audience about my faults and shortcomings.  For one who has been burned by people using personal information against him,  this type of highly personal disclosure's risk is more clearly evident. I, on the other hand have be fortunate enough that people, for the most part, do not use personal information against me. There's a balance here for me personally that probably leans toward disclosure than privacy, but I'm not sure i have struck such a balance yet.    I keep my thoughts on this blog for a number of reasons.     1. the perceived audience provides motivation to consistently keep a journal.  2. struggles with proper motives and thoughts that are outed here also have perceived  accountability and therefore slightly more seriousness in correcting the wrongs.  3. there actually is SOME degree of accountability this medium produces.  4. blogging is entertaining material for those of us bent toward voyeurism.      cincinati  i'm visiting the city to our south tomorrow to hang out with amy and her church community. I am very excited to see what life is like down there.    my year in review  ripped this good idea off of  urlLink maureen.  Thanks friend.    jan   interned at  urlLink element design group  working on coding the first version of the columbus school for girls web site and other fun tasks.   feb   lived in cambodia, mostly at the hotel paradise in phnom penh,  spending precious little on amazing food, getting diarrhea, and  loving the new friends that came across my path.   mar   left the  urlLink village vineyard  church plant and came back to   urlLink vineyard church of columbus  as my primary church family.   apr   i probably broke up with beth in california this month. started working  on my first film, "cambodia", for my senior thesis project at  urlLink OSU .  Started leading a worship band for the middle schoolers at vineyard on saturday nights.  started meeting with  urlLink greg blosser  weekly for discipleship.   may   finished cambodia and sent it to get pressed. Justin Burkett finished up his  year helping me out for school.    jun   Went to the  urlLink joshua house  retreat, "breathe". finished the design program at OSU with a few classes to take still.    jul   worked on editing my second film "breathe" based on the  weekend joshua house retreat. started writing a mocu-mentary  screenplay on christian dating that never got off the ground.    aug   Found a new home group that is wonderful and that I was  really able to give myself to. let the thing with  urlLink greg blosser  fall apart.    sept   matt hofmann moves out inaugurating  the first time i have ever lived by myself for an extended period of time.    oct   started work on editing my 3rd film  urlLink "100 years of flight"    nov   started my blogging adventure. started seriously thinking about starting a  wedding video company. Started writing music consistently inspired by the faux-audience of  urlLink the songwriter forum    dec   started thinking and researching about a documentary on the  history and roots of anti-semitism called working titled "H8".

        muncie  Dare I risk devaluing this experience with even one unintended word that doesn't reflect the total amazement i felt on new years eve and the subsequent day.    urlLink Amy Joy Eversole  is as amazing a woman in person as she had appeared to be from her writing. Nearly 30 hours in her company (with additions of flavor from the wonderful young Christian  community in Muncie Indiana) left me not worn, nor scattered, but only desiring more.   She is truly one-of-a-kind with a sharpness of wit to dish back at me any  funny face or odd-ball squank I'm able to toss her way. She has a love for Jesus that comes through not only in the undeniable patience and gentleness of her nurturing presence, but also in the passion for life, thirst for community and drive to fight unjust actions on EVERY level which she possesses.   I really look forward to deepening this friendship and learning about her beyond all the great and wonderful attributes that are so apparent to me upfront. I can't wait to have conflict, and resolve it. I can't wait to become part of her community  and her a part of mine. And, all realism embraced, I can't wait until this wonderful  high of infatuation wears down and I can get to know the woman who doesn't just fit in some box of ideals, but has struggles and weaknesses and strengths unknown.   This should be fun.    and, in case you're curious, dear one's, there was a wonderful little smooch when the ball dropped, too.        1. daniel and amy leaving columbus 2. amy outside a travel stop in dayton 3. fred   amy at the new years eve party     LOTR: a second viewing   suffer me two brief comments  1. stranded by lava on mount doom, post ring destruction,  Frodo and Samwise are picked up eversogently by eagles.  Frodo seemed unable to hold on, but he was not the only one holding. the eagle had a grasp on frodo and with his tactile senses, could keep Frodo from breaking loose and falling.   such is our Father the Strong Eagle    2. After years of detachment, Bilbo wishes to hold the ring one last time, unaware of the destruction and battle that has surrounded it's evil power.   such are our idols

       ok, so  it's really weird that people are still reading this thing.  theres a lot happening lately.  for the 5 of you keeping up.  1. (mom and grandma dont read this) i got my motorcycle temps.  2. i just a few moments ago designed and did all the scematics and pricing to make a super cool bedframe for 60 bucks.  3. im going to florida friday with amy for my uncles wedding.  4. working at nationwide has been great. lots of support, loads of creative freedom, surprisingly. its been very nice 5. amy and i are on our way toward more stability and love for eachother.  6. i have to move out in a month 7. im looking for a large 1 bdroom or 2 bedroom (pref, half a house) on or around king ave. between high and oldentangy.  8. i am thankfull for jeff cannell 9. justin burkett may  as well be a blood brother. 10. one of these days matt hoffman, justin and i are going to go to st. elizabeths (an old catholoc church building now owned by the church amy came from)in cincy, bring some sleeping bags, and record a worship album in a weekend.  11. looking at scooters to buy when i get enough cash.  12. trying to self-promote at nationwide to land a full time position.  13. taking 2 classes at osu, still finishing.  14. all my furniture that i left at my old apptmt on michigan was hauled off in a truck because i was too lazy to arrange a way to get it out, in that load was the couch i made 2 years ago, and my waterbed, along with 2 other couches. needless to say, when i get my new place, i'm starting from sq. one with furniture. i'm going to try to make as much of it as possible. hence the bed frame design idea.  15. i wish i were closer with Jesus lately. I really want to be around church services and stuff more. unfortunatly, in the circles i run in, that desire is not often shared.  16. matt hofmann is getting married sept 18 on the east coast, im a groomsman .  17. im getting a lot better at piano.  18. i miss the guys at element, being a working stiff has its drawbacks.  19. went to big vineyard today and said hi to some friends. didnt seem to register that i havent been there in almost 5 months! ;) 20. MARK SNOW BOUGHT MY VIDEO CAMERA, which is awesome and frees up a lot of resources for me.  21. my dad gave me 1100 bucks to pay for half of school this quarter! that was a MAJOR relief, as i clearly could not have done it with current resources.  22. went to the ravari room (next to hound dogs that just opened up) and played pool with tawd and our new friend josh, heard a great band, didnt catch their name.  23. whats with all the virus-spam, ARGH, its too much. i got one today that just said " kill him in the picture" WEIRD.  24. kill bill 2 was good. tarentino is a smart guy, with a sense of style i understand.  25. went to see annie hall (woody allen, '76?) with justin and his friend jessica friday. i love me some woody allen, thats fo show.  26. i rode around with my dad today, he on his harley, me on tawd's scooter. a sight i'm sure. if only the one with the flame decals actually went faster, hmmm.  27. living on campus is annoying, i dont know how much i can take of  3am groups of boys shouting "you f***in B***" for hours on end. it really has lost ALL amusement value.  28. i wish people would stop trying to make partisan politics fit the bible. it doesnt work.  29. i hope brooke has her baby without having it induced, indusion sounds painfull.  30. im just starting to realise that i'll likley not amound to much by way of fame or stature. what a mournfull resignation of grownuphood.  i guess the most i can hope for is a God who is faithful. one i understand that, i may be less depressed.   ok, off to pay the rest of my tuition.

        furniture  i just got done making the frame for my sectional.   there are 3 pieces.  1. the main piece. 2 feet by 6 feet (it has a back) 2. a square piece. 2 foot by 2 foot. could be a footstool 3. chaise lounge component. 2 foot by 4 foot  i get excited about all the ways i can arrange them, yep i really am an adult now, arent i?  all very minimal. i'm still thinking about upholstry though.  amy wants purple. i'm slightly more reserved about a purple couch. but i have moved past my ultra-modernist black leather(read i-dont-have-the-money-for-leather-so-i-use-vynal) phase.   i havent been sleeping well this week.  when i go to bed my mind races with furniture ideas. kinda sad isnt it?   on your side  work is going really well. they really "love" me there. and not in the christian sense of the word where they would lay down their lives for me, but i keep getting very positive feedback from VP's about the work i'm doing. today my boss, mary told me that i had people looking out for me that i've never even met.  Then she said that another director asked her to inform him before my project was up so he could presumably use my talents for his group.    a quick note on the shins  the lyrical content of "chutes too narrow" alone is enough to buy this disk. they keep the thoughtful and poetic content flying at you. and the music is so genuine. i love it.

       i went to jo-annes last night and the store is closing so there were crazy discounts on everything.  i bought some foam for a couch, some stuff to make  2 pillows and probably napkins with the leftover material.   i couldent get to sleep because my mind was racing about how i'm going to apholster this thing. (i got 2: 5" thick sofa sized pieces of foam, and a thinner piece for a back) i still have to make a frame and get some kind of apholstry material. 2 years ago around this time i made my first couch.

       i cant help it. i can't stop thinking about it.  i want to build a house. i'm darned near obsessed.  i just want to start in the late spring with 8 steel beams, and no roof over my head as the primary motivator.   it would have to be in the country. you  probably coulden't live in the city without a house too long before people started calling you homeless.   but thats it. i want to start with a pencil and a plot of land, and make a beautiful and  functional dwelling. I want to design and build every stick of furniture in the place too.   i'll do it for you if you'de like. i'll design a whole collection and call it the *your-last-name-here* collection,  by daniel fox.   how cool would that be. then i could make a book of all the collections. and it would be a collection of collections of every stick of furniture in a bunch of *your-last-name-here* houses.   ---  and the latest idea: amy wants justin and i to move to NYC with her and attend grad scool at columbia(or maybe a second undergrad in architecture, or film, or industrial design,  or journalism, or photography or or or). it'd be cool. we'll see if it ever gets feet.   i really do like nationwide. if you ever have a job opportunity  there, it has my stamp of okayness.   i'll find out this week, hopefully, if i can graduate this summer.  i just kind of arbitrarily picked it to see if it can even be done.  who knows, it may happen. if you're reading this and you were either thinking about loaning me money for my last quarter or buying yourself a flat plazma screen HDTV. the rummor is, the  screens burn out in, like, 5 years. I have at least 7 or 8 in me before that happens. throw your cash this way, kind sir.

And so much more, i'm sure.   ok. am tired.  sick.   insights will float to the top, i will be thankfull for them,

       Good Monday friends.   my sectional couch is 75% finished. I've been trying to trim up my belly for getting married.   other than that, I hate the television.   My apartment is nice. I do like it, but it's kinda dark. and really quiet, and just a bit lonely. So the easiest solution is to press that little button and turn on that little box. I don't even like TV. I don't like the programming, I don't like the commercials. Every once and a while  Bart or conan will make me laugh, but really, its such a waste of peace.   I've done fine without it before. For years at a time even. I should put it in the storage locker. I need to find the storage locker first though.   Amy and I have been doing pre-marital counseling with mike and sue B. It's nifty and informal, but also helpful. I'm really sold on doing consoling into our marriage too.   I think that I like the nature of our small church in a lot of ways. But make no mistake, there are many things that become notable more difficult.   For instance, hearing a teaching. A lot can be said for a gifted preacher explaining the bible. I think I'm just starting to get to a point where I can appreciate this type of informational  transfer. Not to say there's no teaching where I am, but there is a homoginy about the age and background of our little church that makes wisdom and experience a valuable commodity.   I don't want to sound like I'm down on small churches.  It's just that I've been doing it for a couple of years now in different forms and one thing I end up missing is being taught from the bible.   I guess that's related to marriage counseling in my mind in the following way. There is a way that the Holy Spirit can get a hold of your heart when you're exposed to the teaching of God's Word. Without the counsel that that brings to an individual, I suppose the next best thing (and the best thing in its own right) is marriage counseling.   I really desire to broaden my perspective from foolishness to wisdom. All the more reason I should find that storage locker, gently place the TV. In it and just try to turn my dark, lonely apartment into a place of peace and rest where I can read God's word and He can, in turn expand my worldview from foolishness to wisdom.

       so, anthropology 200 has me by the earknobs.   just to let you know what the last 3 days have been like,  i'll post my notes. dont worry if you dont know what most of this means, i didnt 4 days ago and wont 4 weeks from now.   definitions: anthropology- the evolution  (change over time) of humans. culture- humankind's extrasomatic (outside the body) means of adapting to the natural environment.   anthropology is holistic, it studies humans in the widest possible sense.  established as a field in 1877 focuses on BIOLOGICAL and CULTURAL evolution 	4 sub fields of anthropology 		1. cultural anthropology -  			human social organization and culture 			studying living groups 			ethnographies- write ups 		2. archaeology 			study of material remains of human activity 			reconstruct past human behavior 			looking at artifacts 		3. linguistic anthropology 			history, function, structure, & physiology of language 			relationship between language and culture 			effect of language on worldview 		4. physical anthropology 			biological anthropology 			biological evolution & genetic variation 			diverse field 			explain adaptive significance of observed variation 				( e.g. what is skin color a variation to. . ?) CULTURE - def.  	a. the way you love 	b. learned, shared, nonrandom 	c. not static 	d. examples of cultural characteristics? 		- religious beliefs 		- food preferences. & means (tools, location, company) 		- work habits 		- dress 		- gender inequalities 		- language 		- standard of living   ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE 	1. strives to avoid ethnocentrism 		a. look at others within the others cultural context (cultural relativism) 		b. advantages to relativistic approach 			- keeping one from jumping to conclusions 	2. holistic approach 	3. evolutionary perspective 	4. scientific approach 		a. what is science? 			-seeking out reliable and repeatable explanations of phenomena  SCIENTIFIC METHOD 	1. make an observation 		-empirical observation (measurable, seeable)  	2. ask a question about the observation 	3. identify variables 	4. propose a hypothesis 		- what is the relationship between the variables 	5. test the hypothesis 	6. develop generalizations  	7 hypothesis -->  test  ---> hypothesis --> test  THEORY -  def. 	1. a statement which no evidence has been found able to disprove the generalization.  	2. theory does not mean it will never be falsified 	3. does not mean we should reject it.    7-27-04  FIXITY OF SPECIES - scale of nature - aristotle 	- from least complex to most complex - great chain of being  	- same as scale of nature, just christian version 	- every place was fixed. nothing could move.  	- NO extintion, no change 	- prevailing idea in europe, surrounding darwin  JOHN RAY - late 1600's 	1. first to use word: species (reproductively isolated organisms) 	2.

       faced with the prospect of getting a job that pays way more than i have ever seen has forced me (ok maybe forced is too militant of a word) to look at exactly what would be a wise use of such extra funds.   i've figured that on an agressive investment schedule amy and i could pay off a house in 6 years.   the thing i dont know is this, and PLEASE help me  out there in finance land, i know my uncle reads this at least sometimes: what's better than putting money into a mortgage? that money is so cheap right now (i'm calculating 4% APR) (all told, the interest on a 140,000 loan at 4% comes to about $17,000 on a bi-weekly payment schedule over 6 years) really, it's prety cheap money.  theres got to be a better ROI than saving that 4% by being an agressive mortgage payer-offer-guy.   the sweetest deal (that i can think of at least) is a 401k corporate fund matching program. if i understand that correctly, for every dollar i take out of my check (tax free, gross) the company matches that dollar in a retirement (or whatever with penalties) fund.   that's basically saying that for every piece of money i can live without now, the company will give me twice that, later)   sorry if this is boring my "readership" or making other peoples brains twist or others thinking i'm just a selfish, money hungry, corporate sell-out.  while others will read this and say, hold your horsies, you aint got no jobby yet.   money is not for money sake. dont read me wrong.  it's not even for securities sake. althought that's the bigggest temptation.   maybe john could chime in here. when does money away invested now get in the way of meeting the needs of AIDS in africa NOW? or building another orphanage in cambodia NOW? if NW is going to give me a 2 for 1 deal on putting it away, that will amass much more than if i just give it away now.   anyway, i'm looking forward to voting for kerry so i can pay more taxes and  support our poor via the government instead of the church. hell, let em do whatever they want with my (*.3)   speaking of which, if you want bush to win, vote NADAR.  but you better bet OBAMA has got my vote in 2012.   so there you have it, a bunch of stuff. my mind just flutters durring the day trying to figure these things out. I guess it's still not close enough of a reality for me to work out on paper.

       a ghost is born, their new album by wilco is really good.  the guy is a dead ringer / update of lennons vocals on hummingbird. it's what i imagine beatles in 65 would sound like if slightly updated.   other than that. the title lyric, "a ghost is born" from the song Theologians  is, to my surprise about the death of Jesus and the subsequent sending of the Holy Spirit to live inside those who believe.      i'm going away, you will look for me  where i go you can not come  and no one is ever gonna take my life from me i lay it down,  a ghost is born. a ghost is born      this kind of stuff. real artists making groundbreaking music with unashamed biblical content, really gets me going.   it makes me want to put out a concept album.

       "nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could."  nothin could be more distintly "this worldly"  as a means of progress than violence.   but whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outragous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of opposition and end them" -paraphrase  shakespear was right. it really is the question.   pacifism, or activism. do you fight violence with violence. more millitary might and power. heaps of violence designed to end violence. culture against culture. right agaist righter. against power.   the more power we exert with money, power, violence,  coersion, manipulation, etc. . . invariable the less  power that will be avaliable to us from Heaven.   After showing Francis of Assisi the riches amassed by the Church, Pope Innocent III said: "You see, the Church can no longer say: 'Gold and silver have I none'"   To what Francis replied: "True, and neither can she any longer say: '...rise and walk.'" Do we lose more of our power the more we give it away?   weakness = strength.

       i've been eating almonds.   i've also been not sleeping.   are these things correlated?  -------  i ended up with a B in my bio class.  better than expected! hurrah.   -------  a theological idea from underground seminary:  Paul (author of most of the new testament) was greatly steeped in the law of the Torah and of his Pharisaical community.   most likely his hermeneutic (way of looking at scripture) was one focused on the end times or eschatology.   if this was the case, his experience of a risen Jesus on the damascus road had much more significance in its implications than we may give credit for today.   1. paul, as a jew was looking for a coming kingdom of liberation politically from the romans. (and really, who ARENT romans these days, eh)  2. in his Pharisee understanding of the end times he would have believed in a resurrection of man. Meaning, once people die, they would, at the time of the arriving kingdom, raise from the dead to live with the Savior and Ruler from the line of David that had been promised through the Old Testament Scriptures.   HERES WHERE IT GETS TRICKY!  3. what paul (and all Pharisees for that matter) expected at the end of the age (a resurrection of the dead, atonement for sin, liberation from oppression, an end to the sacrificial system) God did for Jesus in the middle of the age.   4. the age to come had now become the present age.   (BTW, this is the age you and i are living in today. )  THERE WAS A DEAD MAN ON THE DAMASCUS ROAD: dead men don't live. they don't confront people on roads in their travel. they don't put physical scales or blinders on your eyes that other people have to tend to your blindness because of.   if a dead man was walking, that means the end of the age had come. let's see. . . if the end of the age had come, what else should have taken place, according to a first century Jewish understanding of Prophecy.   well, sin should be atoned for. CHECK! That was taken care of by the sacrifice of by the blood of the man who was innocent and yet chose to die on behalf of the guilty.   which brings me to my next point:  an end to the sacrificial system: Over and over, day in and day out, the Israelites would bring their sacrifices to the temple and offer them to God, laying their hands on the animal (if the sacrifice were and animal) and pronouncing a transference. That is to say that the sins of that dude had now been transfered onto the animal that was going to be killed.   (SIDE QUESTION) Q: why did the Jews do that in the first place? A: God demands purity when approaching His throne, as He, by very nature is completely OTHER THAN what we could conjure given our limitations. Language later in the New Testament, in particular John 3:16, states that the result of sin is that something has to die. And in this system, it was animal sacrifices.   which brings me to my next point.   since animals are qualitatively different from humans, (and there was a definite distinction in the ancient mind, unlike post-darwinian thought linking us more closely to our animal friends through analogous biology) an animals death, simple,  lowly, could not possibly pay all of the debt of a human sin.   Thus, we come to Jesus Christ, who in the middle of history, brings the temple  sacrificial system to an effective screeching halt. Being the perfect man, he had no sin to atone for, subsequently, his sacrifice could be applied to humanity to render ineffective the prison-cell strength of our sinful nature, freeing us to live a life filled with life, love and holiness.   which brings me to yet another reason that paul knew on the damascus road Jesus had brought with his resurrection the kingdom of God.   the Spirit of God who resides in, rules over and comforts those who by faith are adopted into the family of God by the process of that same forgiveness of sin. He has now come, IN PART, to help his church with their directive to manifest this kingdom here on Earth in this present age.   THATS IT, heres a recap  jesus dies and resurrects  with it, he nullifies the need to continue a sacrificial system.  he also brings with him , and in himself the fulfillment of the end times.    -------------   i've been eating almonds.   i've also been not sleeping.   are these things correlated?

       yesterday was an amazing day: it was my birthday, which i had nearly forgotten about.   i need to say thank you to all the kind people who called and e-mailed and asked me how my interview went and wished me a happy birthday!  GOOD NEWS: this morning i woke up with a note in my inbox inviting me to a second interview for the position at nationwide.   the 10 interviewd candidates were narrowed to 4.  i made the 4. i'm very excited. the second interview is with the rest of the team, and the director. This whole groups seems VERY cool and  its definitly a job i can do. its a very exciting proposition.   so , the second interview is 11:15ish next tuesday (8/3). i still havent heard back from OSU.   MUSIC: i downloaded: cant hurry love (supremes) delicate (damien rice) sha sha (ben kweller)  so those are my recomendations  + amy grabbed a copy of Brian Greene's "the elegant universe"   i think the only books i've ever read have been astrophysics books and Cats Cradel by kurt vonnengut.    ok. thanks you. good night

       to top off my great day, i got a call from a recruiter at nationwide who offered me an opportunity to interview for a senior level graphic design / communications position.   my interview is monday. my birthday.   from what i understand, there are 3-5 interviewees.   who knows what will happen, but i'm very excited and very humbled.

       here is a list of all of the good things which have transpired in the last few hours/days:  1. i finished my portfolio book for my interview friday 2. i have an interview at OSU friday 3. i just finished my BIO exam after, you guessed it, oversleeping 4. everyone was very flexible about me oversleeping considering my power went out last night. 5. i think i at least got a C, which gets me maybe a B for the course, hopefully.  6. i got to serve my future wife by brining her her wallet.  7. i got to sample, for the first time, a McDonnalds Breakfast burrito,  8. i am picking up a new and stronger internet signal that i can get in all areas of my apartment and not just standing like an osprey at the door.  9. I landed a major graphic design contract, the details of which i will hash out tonight after work.  10. I got to teach at my house church, which was, no lie, and amazing expierence for me.  11. i was nice to the kinkos girl and she gave me half off the price of my prints.  12. It was confirmed to me that i am officially in the graduation line up for the end of summer 04.   which brings me to a new item unable to be digested in list format: the way i interact with people is undergoing a major trasformation. It's kind off rediculious, but that whole Herb Cohen thing really affected me.  I cant give you back a ton of specifics. but i can sum up the trasformation:  theres no reason to be hard nosed in business dealings unless theres a reason to be hard-nosed in business dealings. When i say "hard nosed" i mean a plethera of things. For instance, trying to come across as more professional sounding than you are, reffusing to engage people enough on a personal level, starting off compromises closed fistedly. For me, it all comes down to this. My work is  my work. I think it's good. Other people pay for me to do work for them, so when it comes to business, i'll let that stuff speak for itself. I dont have to try to overcompensate with some uber-professional attitude to impress a client. In fact, I think what i'm  finding is that said overcompensation reduces the ability to engage the people you're working with on an interpersonal level. Thus the dichotomy is introduced (ugh! not  ANOTHER dichotomy of the western mind. (be patient, i think it's bennificial)). let the work do the business, let the people do the relationship. Ultimatly it frees me up to be a bit of a goof. Well, i'm sure i looked even more like a goof before trying to be a mini-trump. when one is naturally themselves, it comes across in a transaction in the form of trust, grace if you mess up, kindness more often than not, and reciprically friendly behavior.   The thing is, this isnt just affecting business relationships. Its everywhere. work like a lion, act like a lamb. the bumbling (overstatment perhaps), friendly, aproachable demeanior (remember matloc?) puts people at ease and willing to help you. It, in no way means that you aren't just as sharp underneath, you can still asess, and gain information and find out what is important to the person you're talking to.   that matloc, man, he got things done, didn't he?!  well, heres to a bright future of bumbling idiocy!

       OK.   I really don't think it's ethical if you're a business to create more needs than already exist in any market.   Yes, creating a market for a new item is the best way to get a share of whatever is out there, whatever you create. It's the best way to make yourself rich. It's far better than trying to fight for a piece of an already existing and already circumscribed market pie.   Being a first mover in the introduction of a novel product or service is a position of great opportunity, but the global and ethical implications of this position are all too often ignored by corporations or individuals looking to branch into a new area of business.   But, really, it's just not honest for anyone to create a need for a new product or service in a culture already overburdened by consumer fear, individual insecurity, corporate greed, national  debt and a scarred global image.   Maybe the next big market opportunity is looking for a way to let some of the air out of the bubble. Do you know what I'm saying here.   It's easy business to get money by playing off of the  fear and insecurity of individuals. However, it's much harder work to pursue building an organization that will both be ethical in serving America's need for simplicity and sustainable financially.   You see companies doing this in several sectors. For instance, Sprint with the "Fair and Flexible" phone plan (just wait, i'll bet that will show up on those ads at the top of my blog page now.) In addition, there are several publications which espouse simple living.   The question is, are they REALLY providing consumers with a way to deflate their overburdened expectations of products, or are they just creating for themselves a niche-market of people who fancy themselves simple.   In addendum and conclusion, i'll append this post with a very quick thing i wrote for school the other day.    E.D. How times have changed. What used to conjure images of a talking horse now has a completely contrary connotation. Erectile dysfunction is fast becoming the new meaning behind E. D. And no wonder, with drug companies like Pfizer dumping millions into advertising its circulatory enhancing drug Viagra. But a small piece of marketshare is never enough to keep corporations on track in their goals of telling consumers their shortcomings and offering miracle products to cure the ever-increasing gap between reality and perfection.   This, unfortunately for the populous is exactly what is happening with the “younging-up” of marketed advertising of products designed to enhance erectile dysfunctions. While the models are get younger and healthier-looking, the drug companies sit back and rake in profits from a whole new market segment, which most likely don’t even need treatment for E.D.  As the impatience of our society grows, more and more people look toward pills as a viable means to solve problems which may be psychosomatic or relational in nature. While drugs like Viagra and Cialis, have been approved by the FDA, common sense would tell us that it is rarely a good idea to put chemicals into your body to solve a problem that isn’t there.   While greed in corporate America grows, younger men are being subject to chemical solutions to problems that marketers are creating ex-nihlo. This kind of behavior is unethical at best, and downright dangerous at worst.

       i swear i've tried hard to post, i've writen and uploaded, and then nothing. i'll continue later.   but right now, i'm at kinkos in dublin, and it's 4am.  well, 3:42. my dad always used to round time to the closest hour that suited his likings. it looks like i've got the same chromasome.   so why am i here at 4am? well, my power went out in my apartment due to some CRAZY (mwu ha ha) storm that ripped through grandview (and i'm sure central ohio).   i'm printing my portfolio. i didnt want to risk not waking up for my 8:30 final exam in Bio as i am poised to perform average to slightly above average on said exam.  my portfolio: 16 pages crammed full of all the work i'm not completly  embarased to show. theres a lot that didnt make the cut.   i focused on showing variety and systems developed for different clients. why am i doing that?  i have an interview at OSU on friday for a design job.  it wouldent be a ton of money (which i'm learning to accept, even after having exhobanat sums dangled before me) but it's a free education for me, and probably deeply discounted for my future family.   which brings me to my next thought.   if given the option of a free masters degree, what would i want to pursue? here are my thoughts  architecture : 3 years wo/ undergrad in architecture.  journalism: ?? i'd love to be a foreign corrospondant for NPR industrial design: furniture? thatd be fun, but i'd need a workshop MFA: the MFA is the new MBA MBA: i might as well make it official. i've always had kind of a head for business.  probably not graphic design.  photography? fashion design?  just thoughts, i dont really know.   i just got my printed, bound portfolio back from the kinkos girl. it looks good for the most part.   it's cool to see things on the screen, but when you can hold them in your hand, they somehow increase in value.   the question now is, do i stay up all night, or try to sleep?  amy left her wallet in my car, i didnt find it until i left to come here. i think i'll run it back up to her tonight and surprise her with the mundane.   SURPRISE, it's your wallet!

       I love that last name, Cohen. Coming (obviously) from the Hebrew its root is in the coheneem or priesthood, it is the current day signifier for a descendant of Aaron (as far as i know)  so old herb wrote this book called "You can negotiate anything" and a subsequent book "Negotiate This!"   such a cliched title, but I got the book on tape from the library.  it's really great wisdom and strategy about how to negotiate.  herb even launches into lengthy biblical narratives to illustrate  his point. Interesting indeed.

       So the future mother and father in-law were in town  this weekend. How refreshing to be around them. For  a few days, life just felt simple again. Well, apart  from all the wedding planning and soforth.   I'm still trying to understand the significance of  tying yourself to a Christian denomination. Most  recently Amy and I have discussed the idea of being  a part of the Anabaptist heritage (not ANTI-Baptist)   I guess the only real thought I have is this:   premise: any movement toward orthodoxy is by its  very nature reacting to it's context insofaras there has at some point been a deviation from fundamental principles.  If anabaptism (or any denomination of Christianity for that matter) is birthed from a historical reaction to the religious context of their day, would we too not do well to learn from the reformers example, and recreate an orthodox movement in our current context.   It seems less attractive to me to take on all of the theological and practical pengilum swings inherent in any reactionary movement. Rather, we would be wise to see things within their historical contexts and with the light of hundreds of years of history to determine both the successes and pitfalls of any particular Christian movement.   If we too have the same resource in the Eternal Word of God as our predecessors, do we also have the wisdom to utilize the account of history to our advantage?   In this regard I hesitate taking on a label of Anabaptist. Not because I am not a pacifist. Not due to any theological dissention. But rather because I recognize that in the time of  Luther and the reformers there was a need for a radical reformation. Today, we may very well need another radical reformation. But on completely different issues. Materialism,  warmongering, allegiance to Nation over God, Consumerism, individualism, Escapeism, and perhaps a slew of health and wealth doctrines that have penetrated too many groups of believers.   I want my platform to be one of orthodoxy, enlightened by and thankful for the reformers of history, and keenly aware of current reform that is needed.   One may declare, that I too, as a member of a historical and cultural context will inevitably fall off some practical or theological horse along the way to reform. Indeed, I agree, but it does not negate that the need for reform is extant.

       it's been a few weeks since the last update.  Amy's parents are coming in less than 24 hrs. my place is a total mess. chocolate pudding on the walls, cigarette butts cinged into the carpet, bottles of triple sec spilled all over the kitchen and bathroom floor. it's been a rough week.  Its great to have a dog. they're like a human vacuum cleaner, except they're not human and you never have to change their bag. i wish Amy would bring blaze over to eat all the stuff on my floor.  I'm in BIO 101 for a few more weeks. it's so fast paced that it's not as easy as i expected. after that, a few weeks of anthropology, then, done. DONE, as in, with school.  we booked a honeymoon in Jamaica last Sunday. I'll be sure to take a ton of sunscreen so we don't have a burned Amy on our vacation-o-love.  milestones everywhere. college graduation, marriage, honeymoon. I'm just hoping that whatever protection we choose to use once we're married actually works. I'm not so much about being surprised too soon with chilluns. although in due time, my heart sings.

       the following is the result of:  $24,000 initial investment $1500/mo. contribution 8% interest rate assumed  25 years = 6.7 mill  Balance(n) = P(1 + r)n + c[((1 + r)n + 1 - (1 + r))/r] B=24,000(1+.08)25+18000*((1+.08)25 + 1 -(1+.08))/.08 b=648,000 + 18000*(26.92))/.08 b=648,000 + 18000*336.5 b=648,000 + 6,057,000 b=6,705,000  ---------------  35 years=17.4 mill  B=24,000(1.08)35+18000*((1.08)35 - .8))/.08 B=24,000(1.08)35+18000(462.5) B=9,072,000+18000(462.5) B=9,072,000+8,325,000 b=17,397,000  ---------------  sorry to those who are less inclined to look at numbers. I was just pretty  amazed by this. living simply + wise investing + working a normal job can make a man a millionare several times over.

       i'm glad this isnt streching on as long as some  job things do, but heres the latest.   the hiring manager called my manager to see if i would be willing to come in at a lower position. after the interview of the 4 candidates yesterday, two have been eliminated. this leaves me (and intern) and a lateral Sr internal candidate left in the mix.   it's been good odds so far.  not supposed to get the interview --->  33 resumes -----> 10 applicants -----> 4 second interviewers -----> top 2 of the four.   from what i understand there will be a decision made today.   i'm going to have to pull out the old herb cohen and try to negotiate my way through the offer process.   so, there you go, theres the update.

       i'm assuming people care,  perhaps they dont.   my interview this morning went well.   i was one of four. as you know.  turns out, the first interview of the day.  three more, back-to-back for their team.   the hiring manager plans on making a decision by the end of the day. so i should hear back within the week (after things go to HR and they make the official offer)  She emphasized how she was looking for a good "fit" to their team, and additionally, had said that she was very impressed by everything that i had brought to the interview.   unless my social radar is way off (and an interview is  good cause to throw it way off) i think i would fit into their team wonderfully, and i think i proved that to them today.   I gave everything i had. so it's just a matter of waiting.   thank you to everyone who has asked and prayed  and encouraged. you have all been so supportive in this.

       since everyone knows i have this interview, it'll be really embarasing if i have to tell them that i didnt get the job.   and i'd rather not do that.
