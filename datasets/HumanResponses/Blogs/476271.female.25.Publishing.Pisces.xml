      Finished  Chamber of Secrets  and now starting  Prisoner of Azkaban .  I've read that J.K. Rowling put in a lot of subtle hints in the 2nd book, so I was trying to read it carefully.  I see a lot of the little details mentioned that popped up in the 5th book, but I wonder if there's a lot more?

      I finished  Sorceror's Stone  2 days ago, and I'm now reading  Chamber of Secrets .  It's nice to pick up on things I forgot and missed; it makes me go, "Ohhhh...."

      I've decided that before I read stuff on my list below, I'm going to reread all of the Harry Potter books.  I want to see what I missed.  It's been 3 years since I read the first one, I think.  I'm almost done rereading the Sorceror's Stone.

      I was a pitiful English major.  Out of the many books I needed to read, I probably only finished 10, more or less.  Besides having these assigned books, there are many others that I think I just need to read.  There may be some on this list that I read when I was younger, but forgot.  So I may as well read them again.  Okay, here it goes... there's a lot (I'm staring at my bookshelf):       The Catcher in the Rye  by J.D. Salinger    Lord of the Rings  Trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien    The Hobbit  by J.R.R. Tolkien (reread)    The Chronicles of Narnia  by C.S. Lewis                  The Magician's Nephew           The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe  (reread)          The Horse and His Boy           Prince Caspian           Voyage of the Dawn Treader           The Silver Chair           The Last Battle             The Odyssey  (reread)    The Divine Comedy  by Dante Alighieri (finish all 3)                  Inferno           Purgatorio           Paradiso             Dracula  by Bram Stoker (finish)    The Cantebury Tales  by Chaucer    Siddhartha  by Hermann Hesse    Pamela  by Samuel Richardson (finish)    Cloud 9  by Caryl Churchill    Lord Jim  by Joseph Conrad (finish)    The Last of the Mohicans  by James Fenimore Cooper    Robinson Crusoe  by Daniel Dafoe (finish)    Auschwitz and After  by Charlotte Delbo    The Sketch Book  by Washington Irving    The Drowned and the Saved  by Primo Levi (finish)    Autobiography of Angela Davis  by Angela Davis (finish)    Paradise Lost  by John Milton (finish)    Lolita  by Vladimir Nabokov (almost finished... ugh)    Hamlet  by William Shakespeare (reread)    The Merchant of Venice  by William Shakespeare (finish)    A Midsummer Night's Dream  by William Shakespeare (finish)    The House of Mirth  by Edith Wharton (finish)    A Voice from the South  by Anna Julia Cooper (finish)    Maria  by Mary Wollstonecraft (finish)    Inside Daisy Clover  by Gavin Lambert (finish)    The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man  by James Weldon Johnson (finish)    Sister Carrie  by Theodore Dreiser (finish)    The Outsiders  by S.E.

      Sorry, I couldn't think of another title.  I created this list right before I went to Italy for the summer in 2001.  I've updated the list to reflect what I've done, and also added a few more things.  Not in any particular order:      go to Italy  [traveled June-September 2001]   skydive   bungee jump; not in just any place, but in Switzerland like I was supposed to!   ride in a hot air balloon   learn to surf   learn to ride a motorcycle   learn to really defend myself   get in a girl fight-- I know this sounds funny, but I've always wanted to get in a fight with a girl and see how I do.  I wouldn't start it on purpose; we'd have to be fighting for a good reason.  Hopefully this isn't what I do right before I die!   go to New York for New Year's   go to Hawaii   go to New Orleans for Mardi Gras   go back to Venice for Carnivale   see the Sistine Chapel, I missed it when I went to The Vatican   attend a mass given by the Pope   gamble in Las Vegas--for real    go to a stripclub  [went 2 times: Sept/Oct 2001?  and March 2002 for Jerel's birthday]   approach a guy that I think is cute and buy him a drink--if he's not interested, at least I tried [okay, I can't do this now since I'm with Jerel!]   write a book, get published   have at least one of my photographs published in a magazine    have my artwork in a gallery/show  [Dec 2002: Senior Exhibition; Apr 2003: slideshow in Starbucks, group show in Star Shoes]   draw what you see when you travel--at least 1 scene from each town, and take a picture of what you drew [I kind of did this in Venice]   be committed to do some volunteer work for a set amount of time   when I have my own house, have the following rooms:                              library                studio/dark room                music room                  learn to pole dance   master Italian (gotta keep practicing... can't let it go for nothing!)   learn more languages: German, Japanese, Chinese, Latin...   swim in a lake/near a beautiful waterfall   go white water rafting   go on a cross-country trip by car   run in a short marathon for a good cause   learn to play the drums, other instruments other than piano   learn to paint watercolor     That's it for now.  I'll update it as I go along!

      Well, I've been out of school for 3 months now.  What have I been up to?  Work.  I had said to myself that once I'm out of school, I'd have time to do the things I wanted: read, work out, etc.  Have I done these things?  Not really.  So... here I go.  I believe to start things, you gotta plan.  Working out:  see  urlLink Let's Go Fatty  for any progress (not much as of yet!!!).  But here... here is where I'll put my top lists of what I want to do.  I have 2 lists in mind at the moment.  First, of course, is "Things To Do Before I Die."  Gotta live it, you know?  Second list is "Books to Read."  Having been an English major and completely wasting it (well, I didn't exactly waste my time, but I certainly didn't put enough effort into finishing the literature assigned), I really want to read it all: Classics, new stuff, etc.  I've always liked to read and write... it was when I started having somewhat of a social life, school, and work that I lost time for reading and writing.  If I'm going to publish a book one of these days, I better get my mind going.

      I'm currently reading 2 books:  Goblet of Fire  and  She's Come Undone  by Wally Lamb.  Nicole lent it to me; she told me the synopsis and it sounded really interesting.  So far, the story of Dolores Price is nutty.  I can't help but feel for her, but at the same time the girl can be such a bitch!  I'm only into the first 50 pages or so, so we'll see.

      I've been gettin' lazy with photography... it's time to go shooting and get my "creative juices" flowin' again (so clich√©).  Possible projects and things I've been wanting to do:      Family portraits:  I've always thought about the messed up relationships in my family--Allan and my mom, Allan and Robert, Mom and Dad... it'd be interesting to get each together for a sitting.    My old neighborhood:  I've done a project of my old San Diego neighborhood, but what I really wanted to do was haul out some of the old furniture from back in the day (my aunt and mom still have some!) and photograph myself reliving moments from my childhood.  A really extensive project would include shooting at night, but that could be a little scary; it's not exactly the best neighborhood to be hanging out in after dark anymore.  (Thanks to Ken for the night idea!)    Still life:  Nothing special in mind yet, but just to practice with lighting and composition.    Landscape:  I wanted to take some shots out in the desert, or some other really deserted place.    Night shots:  There's a spot Jerel showed me up in LA that views downtown from an overpass... it's an amazing spot.  I'd love to take the 4x5 there and shoot at night.     That's what I can brainstorm at the moment.  I'll think of some more as I go along!

      I just may get my chance to get in a girl fight.  I just found out my brother's "girlfriend" cheated on him.  He caught her in bed with someone else.  I just told Jerel that if we ever see her in public, he better hold me back 'cause I'm gonna  knock her the fuck out.

      There are so many things I want to buy.  Right now, I'm a DVD freak.  I'm slowly building my DVD collection, but there's just so much out there.  Here's a comprehensive list of what books and DVDs I want:

      This weekend, I'm part of  urlLink Pinoy Visions , the video segment of the  urlLink Festival of Philippine Arts and Culture .  The festival runs September 6-7 in San Pedro.  There are two days of screenings I'm involved in: one was this past Wednesday,  urlLink Living Room , and the other is tonight,  urlLink A Fam'ly Affair .  The thing is, I never really thought I'd be part of something like this.  I thought I'd make my film for my  urlLink senior exhibition  and that's it.  But now, being a participant in this makes me wonder if I should continue submitting "Catharsis" into other film festivals.  Also, should I continue making short documentaries?  Narratives?  It goes along with me wanting to write.  It's something I'm going to have to seriously consider.

      I'm not sure if I've mentioned it before, but a when I was young I read this book about medieval mice.  I loved this book.  But when I grew older, and remembered how much I liked this book, my great memory forgot the title.  Well, 18 or so years later, I'm sitting here at work, going over job applications, and this girl talks about literature she liked as a child.  And what do you know-- she mentioned the exact book I was dying to remember!!!  It's the  urlLink Redwall  series by Brian Jacques!  I LOVED it so much, and I was so sad that I didn't remember what it was... I want to hire this girl just for jogging my memory!!!

      I'm stuck in a rut.  I'm slowly going through  Order of the Phoenix  and  She's Come Undone .  There's so much I need to read, too... what's wrong with me?  Am I slowing down?  Am I becoming too comfortable?  I feel like I need a new challenge to inspire me.  I was thinking of applying to this job in New York, but the posting is gone now.  So I think I'm going to work at the same place for another year... I really hope I don't get stuck.

      I am a shopaholic.  I cannot stop buying stuff.  Everytime I go to Target, I look for DVDs that cost less than $10.  Everytime I go to the mall, I've spent at least $75 (I think I've spent hundreds within the past 2 months, eek).  Now, I'm starting to get addicted to Ebay.  I've never really found anything that I wanted on there, but within the past 4 days, I've already won 2 auctions for Paul Frank stuff.  Oh man.  I'm in trouble.  What will I buy next...

      I just added some new sections to reflect what I'm currently reading, watching, or buying.  As you can see, I'm reading (or finished, actually)  She's Come Undone , saw "Elf" on Thanksgiving, and my bro just bought me "Girl, Interrupted" on DVD.

      Well, it's approaching the year mark since I first posted my "Things to Do Before I Die"  urlLink list  last July.  What have I/will accomplish soon?     go to Hawaii (just reserved our tickets today!  July, baby!)   run in a short marathon  for a good cause (Run Hit Wonder, April 2004... good cause?  Maybe.)    Nice to know that I could cross off at least 2 things from that list.

      This isn't a list that I necessarily recommend, but I'm taking these from a raving listserve I used to belong to.  These are the titles the people mentioned they were reading or had just finished, or recommended.  I've heard of a few of them (like  A People's History , of course), but just in case I'd want to peruse these some day, here's my handy dandy list:       urlLink Romiette and Julio   by Sharon M.

      I have not been this broke in a while.  Usually, I'm able to scrape up something from here and there, but for once, I actually cannot max out any resource.  I'm a couple of days late on paying my department store credit cards.  I just moved to the new place and put down a hefty deposit and first month's rent, so I'm so broke.  I'm depending on the kindness of my friends.  Thank god for friends.  I'd be starving if I didn't have them.  Though despite my bad diet, I'm still gaining weight.  The other day, my meals were: lemon cookies for breakfast (thanks Jenn), cheddar twist fritos for lunch (thanks Tin-Tin), and a small bag of popcorn and a large icee for dinner (thanks Charles).  I didn't see Jerel that day and we got in a little tiff, and he says that's what happens when I irritate him.  Haha.  Oh well, last night we had late night buffalo and honey barbeque wings for dinner, along with several glasses of 7&7.  But today... kindness of others again.

      So much to do.  Gotta make some maps for my Projects in Intermedia class.  Need to catch up on my reading for my English classes.  Gonna shoot more photos in San Diego.  It's weird... I'm actually getting some attention for my artwork.  Or, my stuff gets noticed.  There was this "Pocket Dictionary of Assumptions" that I had made last Winter quarter for Anne's class, and she told me that she had shown it to people.  A grad student that I don't know told some other people he liked my work from my senior exhibition - he knew my full name, too.  Then, my classmates in my Advanced Photo class want to see my video from that exhibition.  And they like my photos.  I feel like an actual artist.  Never thought that would really happen... never thought people would actually like my work.  It's a nice feeling.

      The Superbowl has come and gone.  Damn, Tampa Bay spanked the Raiders.  I listened most of the game on the radio.  Jerel and I drove down from Irvine to San Diego 'cause I had to take pictures of my old torn down neighborhood in southside.  An interesting observation: I have never seen so many people speed in just one hour.  The average speed must have been 85-90 mph on the 65 mph limit, and there were many others speeding past us at about 100+.  Another observation: many cars with flat tires.  After a quick photo shoot in San Diego, we drove up to Burbank for the Superbowl Party at Charles' place.  We made it at the very end.  And then I had some beer.

      Today, my boss officially made an offer to me today to stay on after I graduate.  I think I'll do it.  I was thinking of it, and it's probably for the best for the time being.  I'm taking 20 units this quarter, which leaves very little time to do some serious job hunting.  The market ain't that great anyways, and I'm still trying to figure out what I really want to do.  I'm thinking of something in publishing... I don't know for sure yet.  But anyway, the terms are really flexible.  They know I'm looking for something else, so I can work as many hours as I want, and still get medical benefits.  The pay is, well, okay, not great, but at least it works with what I want for the most part.  And they all love me here, heehee.  I have some time to think it over still, but I think I will do it.  But I promise!  I will not become a statistic and get stuck here!!!

      Alright!  Time to get serious.  I'm going to finally keep up with this stuff and post my random crap.  I can't talk to all of you all at once over the phone or on AIM so here I go!  I just got an email from a professor at school who is in charge of visual resources.  He curates slide shows displaying artist's work at the school cafe and 2 other cafes near campus... and he asked me to participate!  He wants to show a photo from the cd catalog from my Fall Exhibition.  I feel special =)

      Well, school is winding down to the last weeks...  I can't believe I'm actually going to be done with school in a little less than a month.  I'm getting really lazy though... just knowing that I don't have to go to class anymore is such a relief.  Well, actually, I still want to take some classes, like Keeley's Studio Lighting course.  Maybe he'll let me sit in.  Then I still want to take some creative writing courses at a community college.  Something.  Maybe I should take some classes in New York?!  Well, at least I'll start to really pay off my debt once I start working full time.

      Spring Break has come and gone, and I didn't really do much.  On my actual birthday, Jerel cooked dinner for Tals, Joanne, and I.  I spent most of the day watching the beginning of the war.  Then that Saturday, we all went out to Rock Bottom in San Diego downtown, then Bar Dynamite.  It was chill.  Got a little faded, but not much.  Then I had work... then this past week I've been driving around a lot.  San Diego last Saturday, then Sunday night, I drove Jerel back up to LA.  Drove back to Irvine early Monday morning... then drove back up to LA Thursday night for Jerel's birthday, then back to Irvine Friday morning.  Friday night, I drove to San Diego to watch Jason's sister perform for Music Machine (Josalyn, you've grown up so much).  Then Saturday morning, back up to Irvine (or Santa Ana, actually) for Nicole's bridal shower.  THEN, Saturday night, Jerel lost his wallet, so I drove up to LA again to cheer him up.  And then I drove back to Irvine this morning.  I've been up since 5am.  Then I'm sitting in Keeley's Studio Lighting class this morning (I'm such a photo nerd).  And now I'm at work until 5pm.  Surprisingly, I'm not tired at the moment.  ***UPDATE*** (4:05 PM) Ryan just stopped by my work!!!  I haven't seen him in a LONG TIME.  I was so happy to see him.  He's at UCI to get a transcript.  I took a break, and he's like, "Let's go get a beer!"  I protested at first, but I ended up just having one with him at the pub.  So I had a pint of Newcastle and now I'm a little buzzed.  And I'm working.  BUT IT'S ALL GOOD!  I'm fine.  I have my breath mints and gum and I'm fine.  I can still work.  I'm so glad he stopped by to see me.

      What Pre-1985 Video Game Character Am I?           I am  an Asteroid .   I am a drifter. I go where life leads, which makes me usually a very calm and content sort of person. That or thoroughly apathetic. Usually I keep on doing whatever I'm doing, and it takes something special to make me change my mind.  What Video Game Character Are You?       my alternative is...         I am  Kong .   Strong and passionate, I tend to be misunderstood, sometimes even feared. I don't want to fight, I don't want to cause trouble, all I ask is a little love, and a little peace. If I don't get what I want, I get angry, and throw barrels and flaming oil at whatever's stopping me.

      Happy St. Patty's Day!  I'm wearing my green today, are you?  I don't think I'll drink tonight though.  I still haven't finished one of my English papers that was due last Thursday.  Tsk tsk.  But for those of you who know, I've been really busy.  But it's ALMOST OVER!!!  I CAN'T WAIT!  My birthday is Wednesday.  Big ol' 2-4.  Woopdeedoo.  I'll let you all know what I plan to do when I have time.  ***In the spirit of St. Patrick's Day, I will give a little humor.***  One day an Englishman, a German, and an Irishman walked into a pub together. They each bought a pint of Guinness. Just as they were about to enjoy their beer, three flies landed in each of their pints, and were stuck in the thick head. The Englishman pushed his beer away in disgust. The German fished the fly out of his beer, and continued drinking it, as if nothing had happened. The Irishman, too, picked the fly out of his drink, held it out over the beer, and started yelling, "SPIT IT OUT, SPIT IT OUT YOU BASTARD!!!!"  ***Thanks to Bill, who made it sound better with accents and all.***

      I went to the doctor today... finally.  I've been having stomach pains for the past 6 months now.  I haven't gone because of money... but I guess I can't take it anymore.  Nicole lent me $100 to go, which I am eternally grateful.  So, after everything, I'm diagnosed with IBS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  Woohoo.  They took blood from me, and the doctor said she'll call me in a week if there's anything wrong.  But for now, I get to eat a lot of fiber.

      Ah..... I'm so exhausted!  Had the show last night and it was a success, I think!  There was a great turnout.  Jerel and I got there around 9:30 or so and met up with Johnny, Freida, and Fernand.  My brother got there with Angela around the same time.  We were practically the only ones there at the time.  They weren't showing the work yet, so we waited around and had some drinks.  When they finally opened it up, people started trickling in.  Aud, Kris, and Kris's roommate Vi showed up, and then Tals came.  Joanne didn't come, but that's okay (I guess!  Just kidding).  Next thing I knew, there were so many people.  It was a whirlwind of meeting a bunch of people my brother knew... and it was so funny, cause Marc D. was there, and it just so happened that he was the one who held my bro back when he was about to fight Francis!   Small fucking world!   It's like, how long have I known Marc?  Since the end of 8th grade?  And then we all lived in the same area in SD but they never knew each other back then, but now it turns out he's been friends with Allan!  AND he got his back.  I'm surprised he didn't see the resemblance before and didn't put two and two together.  That's too funny.  I got a lot of compliments on my work.  I was so embarrassed, but only because I'm not used to that kind of attention, you know?  But it was a great experience.  I was so happy... and a little tipsy.  Had some wine and all.  I'm so glad I got to show my work in that kind of environment.  Jerel and Freida want to show work there now.  It's gonna be a monthly thing.  Now I gotta get ready to show my stuff in Japan!!!  I'm gonna reprint the work and mount them better.

      I'm at Michelle's house right now...  Last night, everybody went downtown to E Street Alley for Jay's going-away to boot camp.  It was fun hanging out with everyone.  I didn't get as wasted as last time at least.  Jerel had Johnny's Bachelor Party #1.  They went to Spearmint Rhino last night.  I guess all the guys met up at Jerel's to drink, and then they went to the stripclub.  I wonder what's next for Bachelor Party #2.  Joanne just left to get Julian and get ready at her mom's so that we can all have lunch together.  Jerel wants me to take the train up to LA.  I said yeah as long as he pays for my ticket.  So he's gonna shell out $24 so I can take a 3-hour train ride from SD to LA.  Awww he wants to see me that bad, how sweet.  The train leaves at 3pm.

      Jerel will be working at  urlLink Canned Interactive .  It's a paid "internship."  He'll be getting paid pretty well for a full-time "internship" but he won't get benefits (hence "internship").  He'll be getting more than me!  But that's okay, now he can take me out.  He'll be working with Gib also, thanks to Charles.  Now the three of them will be working together... uh oh!

      Hi everyone!  I had an interesting weekend, how 'bout you?  Well, Friday was Jason's 23rd birthday.  After he went to Disneyland with the guys, they came over to my place to chill for a bit.  After they left to go back to SD, I went up to LA to meet up with Aud and Michelle at Zen Sushi.  For those of you who haven't been there, every one Friday of the month (I'm not sure when exactly), my bro's friend has an event there with a live band and live art on the upper level, and dancing on the lower.  I went with Jerel and Chris, and you know when The Devil is around, someone is bound to get drunk.  So the three of us end up having some sort of drinking marathon.  Next thing you know, Aud comes up to me and says, "I just saw your bro downstairs."  I'm like, pretty drunk by this time, and we rush downstairs to go see what he's up to 'cause whaddya know, he's with Angela.  Aud and I are out in the middle of the dancefloor by ourselves, kinda spying on the two, but I just decide to go up to him.  And well it's a good thing I was drunk 'cause I was okay with the two of them being together.  I guess they are seeing each other.  We went upstairs to say hi to Jerel and Chris.  Chris was like, "What's going on?!"  But Jerel was cool with it, too.  Again, good thing we were  drunk.   After, we all went to Full House to grub on some Chinese food.  I was so drunk I didn't get to enjoy it.  I ate a little, and kept going to the bathroom to gag.  Everyone else was eating good though.  I think Jerel and Chris inhaled everything 'cause we weren't there for very long.  Said bye to everyone, then went back to Jerel's.  I  couldn't breathe for awhile, I was so drunk, and somehow passed out.  Woke up the next day with a bit of a hangover.  Jerel tried to cure my hangover with McDonald's breakfast, but I still couldn't eat.  He got my brakes changed (what a sweetie) while I lay in bed recovering.  I didn't actually get up until 4pm!  I was supposed to go to SD to go hang out with everyone for Jason's bday, but then I'd have to drive up again for Easter with Jerel's family the next day.  I talked with Jason and he was cool with me just staying up.  They all ended up going out that night though.  As for me, I spent my Saturday evening running errands with Jerel.  We went to CIPA(?) for the Filipino Art show (Jerel was showing our videos) on Temple.  We ate at Full House  again  'cause we wanted to fully enjoy the food I didn't get to eat the night before.  Tons of leftovers (Jerel and I have a problem of ordering a lot of food).  Then we went back to CIPA, then went to Wendell's place (Jerel's cousin) to capture video for Jerel's project.  Good ol' Jer Jer forgot the tape, so we had to drive back to his place to get it.  Then we went back to Wen's, then went to I Love Boba.  I gotta say, they have THE BEST boba there.  I love the Straw-Peach Boba Smoothie, it's so refreshing.  After capturing video, we finally went down to Irvine.  We didn't get there until 3:30 am.  Next morning, we woke up late.  Jerel finished his laundry, and then we went back up to LA for Easter.  We were pretty late (I was supposed to bring my dad, too, but it was late).  I was going to just drop Jerel off 'cause he was gonna go to the Dodger game with the guys, but Lil' Drunk John got faded the night before and busted his hand on a lamppost.  And Mike got drunk and slept in his car.  So there were two extra tickets.  So, Jerel's cousin and I ended up going to the Dodger game with the guys.  It was a lot of fun.  Jerel bought us Dodger shirts.  I guess I'm a Dodger fan now.  Jerel wants me to wear it when they play the Padres in Petco Park.  Yeah right!  So then after the game, we went to Ron's and watched them play 2K3 against some dumb guys online.  Then we got Tommy's... chilled at Jerel's cousin's for awhile, then went home.  So tired.  Didn't get back to Irvine till this morning.  Now I'm at work.

         twilight zone...     Damn, what a small world this is.  I was picking up my dad in Long Beach, and Allan had a story for me.  Get this:  Last Saturday, he finally broke up with Karla.  When it came down to it, he didn't trust her and it just wasn't the same as before.  So, he did it, but of course was sad.  So to cheer himself up, he went out with some friends.  He ended up meeting a really cool girl and talked with her the whole night.  He thinks this girl is really cool, so he decides to take this girl out.  This past Thursday, she came over and saw my dad and the apartment.  Then they went out to dinner.  After dinner, Allan wanted to take her out to two different clubs that his friends own.  So they go to the first one.  Then, they leave the first one and are on the way to the second place.  They started talking about another club called... Sound... Sound something.  I forgot.  Anyway, Allan mentions how he got into a fight there.  And she's like, funny, my friend got in a fight there, too.  So then, Allan's like, uh oh, who's your friend... and of course it's Francis.  And she starts laughing.   (FYI: Francis is one of Jerel's good friends.  A year ago, Allan and Karla separated, and she started seeing Francis.  You can see how the situation got strange, with Francis being Jerel's friend, me going out with Jerel, and Allan being my brother...  So anyway, Karla and Francis were seeing each other for the past year, but I guess broke up several months ago.  She ended up bumping into my brother, and they started to try to work things out.  Little did Allan know that Karla was trying to work it out with Francis at the same time.  So anyway, Allan ended up taking Karla to this club, and Francis happened to be there... to try to make it short, Francis saw Karla and they started getting arguing... Allan saw this and came up to Francis and pushed him... each other's friends pulled them apart... of course, neither knew who the other was at first.  Francis later tried to tell Allan what was going on... and well eventually, it just seems apparent that Karla is trying to play both of them.)   So anyway, Allan thinks about the situation and laughs too.  Coincidence, right?  Eventually he and the girl get to the second club, and they're talking... and of course, the girl ends up knowing Karla, too.  So they get to talking more about who each other knows, and she realizes she knows me.  She finally makes the connection that I'm Allan's sister (I don't know how she didn't recognize me from the pictures at the apartment, most people will see the resemblance).  So, my brother is telling me all this, and I'm like, "Who is it?!" and my brother is all, "Just listen!  I'm getting to that."  So he continues with the story, and says that they talk more about who they know, and of course my brother tells me, "She knows Jerel."  I'm quiet.  Allan's like, "Do you know what I'm getting at?"  I'm still quiet, but getting scared.  Then Allan says, "She knows about Jerel's past."  Now I'm really scared.  I'm like, "Oh no.........."      And Allan says, "It's Angela."  I jumped up and screamed.  I ran around the apartment, jumped up and down and was laughing and tearing at the same time.  Do you have any idea how I felt?  It was funny and disgusting at the same time.   (For those of you who really don't know, Angela is the girl that Jerel was seeing before me.)    Blech!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       What is the world coming to?  My brother was saying he feels like he's in the fucking twilight zone.  The situation is funny as hell, but, yuck!!!!!!!!  My brother couldn't sleep when he got home that night.  My dad said, "No wonder when he got home that night, he walked in and said, 'SHIT!'"  I think my brother has to move to another city, he knows/meets too many people!!!

      I was a little sad earlier due to some unfortunate events   (nothing happened to me, but to some people I know), but I've been cheered up a little bit.  I just talked with the Office Manager for the Bookstore.  I had to sign some papers that indicated I am no longer a student and now a casual employee.  I have to go to a new employee orientation on Monday which explains the benefits I will be getting.  Then the manager indicated how much I was getting paid hourly.  And guess what- it's even more than I expected.  I had asked for more than what was originally offered and secured a little more than I expected I would get.  Then I end up getting even more than what was agreed upon.  What do you know.  I am still sad though for my friends.  ***UPDATE 11:32PM*** I just came back from eating dinner with Joanne at El Torito.  We were in the bar area just chillin' and having drinks after the Laker game, when a guy comes up to our table just to say hi to Joanne.  He had noticed her from across the room and had to say hi.  He was nice though.  Works for Kawasaki!  Aw, too bad Joanne can't get a hookup to ride on a motorcycle.  He was interested, but she told him she had a boyfriend (see Charles, Joanne was good!).

      My brother, Allan, told one of his friends about me.  His friend is curating a show, "On the DL" in LA (it might be in Starshoes, I'm not sure) which will exhibit urban art ranging from graffiti to photography.  I went over to Allan's last night and his friend had finished the flyer, and already put my name on it before seeing my stuff.  I'm supposed to show it to him this Saturday.  I'm a bit intimidated.  But the cool thing is, I'm probably going to get to show it in Japan, too!  I'm excited.  I think I'm going to show my marathon piece.  But I have to reprint them before the show and mount them correctly.  Wish me luck!

      Jerel, Charles, Joanne, and I went to  urlLink Santa Ana River Lakes  to go fishing.  We were there from probably about 7:30am-5pm.  We took a boat out and each got a good sunburn.  For the longest time, none of us caught anything!  Some guys on another boat (we called them the Angler Angels) gave us 5 extra catfish and their bait.  During the last hour of fishing, I finally caught 2 catfish which we named "Big Poppa" and "Captain Hook" (because we couldn't take the hook out of the mouth).  So we didn't go home empty handed, and it was fun.  But damn, I got a pretty bad sunburn.  I only applied sunblock twice, and now it looks like I have a permanent wife-beater on.  Yesterday, it felt like my bra strap was cutting into my skin.  Today ain't as bad.  I'm just trying to apply lots of aloe vera, but Jerel took my bottle to work today.  Well, I'm the boss for the next two weeks while Nicole is on her honeymoon.  Wish me luck!

      I just came back from Nicole and Eric's  urlLink wedding .  It was beautiful.  She had a string quartet for the ceremony.  I want a string quartet at my wedding!  Oh, at the beginning of the reception, they usually introduce the new couple.  When the emcee announced Eric and Nicole, they rode in on a big wheel/tricycle!  Eric was pedaling and Nicole was riding on the back.  It was so cute!!!  Eric even modified it so it had this chain steering wheel and spokes, I think.  I'd want to do something like that at my wedding.  My feet are tired from dancing the night away.  But I had a lot of fun.  I didn't drink too much, just a glass of red wine and an amaretto sour.  Food was good, too.  Okay, time to relax!

      3-day weekend!  Had a busy day today.  I'm the boss for two weeks while my supervisor gets married and goes on her honeymoon.  So I was taking care of stuff while at the same time trying to figure out these birthday invitations for my sister's boss.  Took me half the day!  Anyway, Jerel and I finally talked.  He came to Irvine last night while I was at Joanne's, so everything's cool now.  I played with baby Jacqueline, she's SO CUTE.  But I think she went poopies while I was holding her.  Tonight I'm off to San Diego for a night of bad things.  Then back up to Irvine/LA tomorrow, and then Nicole's wedding on Sunday.  Then Monday I'll probably go fishing.  Have fun everyone and get faded/high/trip!  Hehehe.

      I think The Matrix series is a curse.  When the first movie came out, I got in a fight with Jason.   Now that the second one has come out, I got in a fight with Jerel.  Not just any fight, but a pretty bad one.  I won't say what happened, but I never thought he could say the stuff that he said to me yesterday.  It shatters my confidence in men.  I am not happy right now.     And I still haven't seen the movie!!!

      Long night of television!  I kept switching back and forth between the final episode of  urlLink Dawson's Creek  and  urlLink American Idol .  At least both shows had the outcome I was wishing for: Ruben and Clay are the finalists while Joey got with Pacey.  I'm so happy!  Hahaha!!!

      "Stick Club," or whatever you want to call it, got brutal Friday night.  More of Jerel's friends came over to Ron and Janelle's to watch the Laker Game, and after the game, they started initiating people.  Jerel's arms look ugly right now.  At first it looked like tire tracks, but now it's just a bruised mess.  The night wasn't complete without Jerel slamming the screen door into Irwin's arm.  Saturday was a good day.  Jerel, Charles, and me went shopping.  First we smoked a little bit, then ate at Rubio's.  Then we shopped for a very long time (my feet were really tired by the end of the day).  I'm planning to get these Top Seven Asics... we went to this shoe store in Pasadena and saw these nice kicks.  I tried on the last one in my size and was going to get them but it turns out it was on hold for someone else, and they came when I was going to get them!!!  It was like a total tease!!!  If anyone sees them in Sandstone/Dark Brown, LET ME KNOW!!!  I'll probably go to Melrose this coming weekend to see if I can find them.  If not, I'm going to get the brown ones.  I was supposed to go to SD to hang out with Michelle and Amy, but I was running late so I didn't go at all.  Instead we all smoked some more and went to this underground hip hop show at the Knitting Factory.  I wasn't in the mood to go, but it turned out to be a nice event.  We saw  urlLink Bambu  and  urlLink Kiwi  perform for  urlLink Native Guns  and Jerel ended up buying Bambu's CD.  I like it a lot.  I'm so tired of the crap that's out on the radio right now, so it's nice to hear something underground.  And of course, we ran into my bro and Angela again.  The good thing was that Francis and Allan actually talked to each other and they're cool now.  I spent Mother's Day with Jerel's family.  Ate a lot.  We also played Trivial Pursuit for a very long time.  Jerel and I won (Team Irvine, haha).  There was a question that could've ended the game with our win if I didn't get it wrong: What is the second largest city in California?  Stupid me, I thought San Francisco 'cause of how dense it is.  But it's SD of course.  Duh.  They laughed at me for not knowing.  So that was my weekend pretty much.  Now it's back to work... I'm just waiting for May 15,  urlLink The Matrix: Reloaded !

        Another day at work, but it's Friday!  I haven't been on AIM in awhile.  Since we have a lot of new student workers, we're trying to limit our AIM use... well actually, students aren't supposed to use it.  I can use it at my discretion, but I figured I'll just stay off for awhile.  I happened to get in a little argument with Jerel the other day.  Or, well, he had a stressful day and he took it out on little unsuspecting me.  But he paid for it later that night when he and his friends decided to start a "Stick Club."  The 4 of them were playing Fusion Frenzy against each other, and whoever lost got hit with a bamboo stick.  Well, Jerel was drunk and ended up getting hit the most.  I saw their arms and the video last night... it was pretty funny.  What else?  Oh!  I just got an email from Katia and she's engaged.   Engaged!   Haha, she recalled one night we were walking around Siena and we were talking about what we thought each others futures had in store.  Lucia had said Katia would be the first to get married and have kids, but Katia thought it'd be me since I was having all those maternal feelings.  And well, Lucia was right!  Hehehehe...  as much as I'd like to start a family, I don't think that will happen any time soon.

      Just another one of those  ordinary  weekends, right?  Jerel and I didn't get to watch X2 until Saturday night.  I wasn't feeling well so we went home.  Before the movie, my family/family friends and the significant others went to  urlLink Emerald Chinese Seafood Restaurant  in San Diego.  So, it was Grandma, Mom, Dad, Auntie Gloria, Auntie Nene, Uncle Ver, Bong, Susan, Robert, Charleen+Matt, Allan+Angela, and Jerel+I.  Poor Robert was picked on by everyone: "Where's your partner?  Where's your girlfriend?"  Even Grandma was picking on him.  So we ate, and then of course was heckled by mom to take picture after picture after picture...  Sunday, Jerel and I actually slept all day, so we didn't go to LA.  BUT... I guess Jerel should've went Sunday night 'cause early Monday morning we got some bad news.  To make a long story short, we spent Monday rushing to LA to post bail for The Devil.  Luckily, things are okay.  But it was pretty eventful!  I just got back to Irvine this morning with Joanne.  I'm tired!!!

      It's Friday, yay!  Plans for the weekend... tonight, Jerel's coming down to Irvine so we can watch X2.  I talked to Allan and he said he was gonna watch it too... he told his work that he has to leave at 5pm so he can drop me off at the airport.  Uh huh.  Then tomorrow, I guess my grandma is going back to the Philippines... my mom says probably for good.  So, she wants to have a going-away dinner for her.  So that's the plan for Saturday.  Then Sunday, Jerel wants to go back to LA to shoot more footage for his After Effects video.  So I guess I'll go with him.  That's pretty much it.  Hope everyone has a great weekend!!!

      I am sooooooo tired...  I finished the book on Wednesday morning, but the lack of sleep has caught up with me.  I was dozing off really bad yesterday while I was working.  Anyway, I'm really excited!  Tonight I'm gonna watch  urlLink Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle .  Then early tomorrow morning, Jerel and I are off to celebrate our 1 year anniversary (it was 2 weeks ago on Father's Day, so we're celebrating now).  I don't know what's planned...  but it should be good!  I'm gonna leave my phone off for most of the weekend... so if you need to get a hold of me, leave a message and I'll get back to you when I feel like it.  HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND, I will!

      My weekend:   Friday night:  Brawl on Broadway.  Saturday night:  Jaynee's graduation party; Bar DZ... luckily another brawl was avoided since that person who caused trouble 2 weeks ago left when we came...  good thing- Charles was pissed, but he sure was in good spirits when he mooned us as he and Joanne drove off; Jason's place until 4:30am; read  Harry Potter  until 6:30am.  Sunday:  Slept until 11am, continued reading.  Went to Jason's, went back down to Chula Vista to drop off him and Brian, and then ate at Rubio's.  Took nap.  Drove back to Irvine.  Showered.  Drove up to LA, arrived around 2:30am.  Wondering about the "Brawl on Broadway" fiasco?  Ahhh... the drama is back.

      Ahhh... a weekend free of drama.  Friday morning, I went to my sister's work and the guy who does most of the electrical work for the cars (alarms, GPS systems, DVD players, etc.) looked at my alarm and reset everything.  It was working okay when I left.  Went to work.  Left work early to take Metrolink to LA.  Rode on the Metro for the first time by mysefl.  Not bad, not bad at all.  I love public transportation.  I met Jerel at Hollywood/Highland, and we ate at Ruby's, a Peruvian restaurant.  They only have about 5 tables inside, and Jerel tells me the food takes longer to bring out if you order different things 'cause they only have one stove/pan.  Pretty funny.  But the food was GOOD.  Mmm... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  It was like carne asada fries (well, just the beef and french fries) but better!  Saturday, we had brunch with The Rhino's family for his sister's graduation.  We ate at the Hilton at Universal City.  It was pretty good.  When we got back to Jerel's, we slept the day away.  Plus it was hot in his house, so man, it was one lazy day.  That night, we went to his cousin's house and waited for them to get back from the airport (they went to Hawaii).  After that, we drove back to Irvine.  We picked up my car from the train station and guess what I found- a note on my windshield from security that read, "Adjust your car alarm.  It has been going off all night."  So much for resetting the alarm.  I disconnected the sucker.  We drove back to my house, then decided to rent "The Adventures of Cookie & Creme" for Playstation 2.  Jerel got so frustrated playing.  It's a game where you have to work together to get through the different stages.  The game can be frustrating because some of the game play is difficult/crappy, but I had fun.  Sunday, we ran around meeting with both of our families for Father's Day.  We had lunch in Long Beach with my dad, Allan, and Charleen.  Then we went to LA.  Jerel bought a DVD player for his dad.  Then we went to Chinatown for Full House food (yum), and then to the Valley.  His parents were very nice to me.  They were telling me all these stories of when they went on a cross country trip in their old van.  It was probably the first time I felt really comfortable with his parents.  I think his family has finally accepted me =)  We drove back to Irvine late last night.  Then back to the routine.  Sorry no really exciting drama.  Well, I guess I can add that that person who caused last weekend's drama apologized.  He claims he doesn't remember what he did; too drunk.  I guess... but Jerel and Charles are still not happy about it.

      Someone help me... MY CAR ALARM IS GOING NUTS!  It started Tuesday while I was warming up my car.  The alarm just started going off while the engine was on.  I turned my car off and turned it back on, and it still did it.  I was driving to work, and it would go off periodically.  Wednesday, didn't do it.  Then Thursday, it did it again, right when I was stopped at a stoplight and a pedestrian was crossing the road.  But look at the time... my car went off around 4:30am, and would NOT turn off!!!  I had to start my car, and even then it would go off periodically.  I'm so embarrassed.  My sister and I are going to take it to her work so they can look at it, right when they open at 6:30am.  Great way to start my Friday.

      Why do I always have drama-filled weekends?!  Saturday night didn't turn out so good... I don't think I should say what happened, but it's so sad, I guess we have San Diego/Los Angeles enemies now.  One good thing out of the weekend: Sunday we went to Universal City Walk for Joseph's birthday.  Joseph, Joanne, Jerel, and I rode the mechanical bull at Saddle Ranch.  That was fun.  Then poor Joseph got kicked out for trying to ride the bull again (extremely drunk).  So he got escorted out a bit, and then he threw up a whole lot.  And it's all on video.  Can I also say, I'm so addicted to  urlLink Friendster ?!  It's strange.

      Late to work... AGAIN.  Man, I sure am late a lot.  But actually, today wasn't my fault.  I went up to LA last night for Immaculate Heart's High School graduation (Jerel's cousin, Vanessa, graduated)... drove through traffic... and then left this morning at 6:08... and got caught in more bad traffic.  There was a 3-car accident on the 5S near the 55... and I was almost home!!!  Took me 40 minutes more than usual.  And I HAVE to get my Coffee Bean before work, so I came into work around 8:50.  I haven't been on time AT ALL since being the boss for the past 2 weeks.  Hehe.  Drunk John (aka the Lil' John or "The Town Drunk") is having a graduation party in Long Beach.  So I'm gonna head out there with Joanne, and then tomorrow night I'm gonna watch  Finding Nemo  at the El Capitan Theater.  Jaynee is driving down from SF and doesn't want to drive to SD the whole way, so she's gonna stop in LA and spend the night.  Ivy's celebrating her birthday at Aubergine Friday night also in SD, but I can't make it.  Okay, I need to stop fooling around and get to work.  I know there's stuff to do, I just need to find it!

      Okay.  I was thinking about  Reloaded  and how I thought I understood what was going on, but realized I need to see it again.  I need to watch the first one over again, too.  To help clear up some stuff, I decided to read what other people thought and came across a nice  urlLink discussion .  The more I read the discussions, the more I really liked the movie.  Gets you thinking...

      I finally saw  urlLink The Matrix: Reloaded  and  The Italian Job .  I thought  Reloaded  was okay, I can see why girls love it and guys are like, "Eh..."  I still liked it, though.  I really liked  The Italian Job , it was really entertaining.  And I just think Mark Wahlberg is hot.  Haha!  Besides Marky Mark being cute and all, it was a really good cast with a good script.  Seeing scenes of Italy was enough for me (oh how I miss Italy).  Remember how I got sunburned while fishing last week?  Well, I'm finally peeling.  I knew my shoulders were beginning to peel, but this morning I took a shower and found out that my scalp got sunburned, too!  It was gross, my hair was wet and it looked like I had a really bad case of dandruff.  I mean, really bad.  I freaked out and tried to take out as much of it as I could before work.  I told one of my student workers that if it looks like I have a bad case of dandruff, don't freak out.  Yuck, huh!  And I thought Jerel was the only one!

      I just received another opportunity to show my work!  Jerel's cousin, Wendell, showed "Catharsis" to a group of people at  urlLink Visual Communications , an Asian Pacific media arts center based in Los Angeles.  They are participating in the Festival of Philippine Arts & Culture, entitled "Pinoy Visions," which is taking place September 6-7, 2003 at Pt. Fermin Park in San Pedro.  The film and video program would be on Sept. 3 at the Visual Communications' headquarters in Little Tokyo.  Abe Ferrer, the Exhibitions Director at Visual Communications, contacted me via email yesterday shortly after I spoke with Wendell.  According to Wendell, once they saw my video, they had to include it in the screening.  I'm so excited!  I can't believe people are really liking my work.  Of course, this wouldn't even be possible without Jerel's fabulous video editing.  This is so cool.

      Have I ever been to Vegas and not have fun?  NEVER.  Whether it's 100∞ or freezing cold, Vegas never fails me.  This past weekend was Freed's bachelorette party, hosted by the lovely Marsh.  We ended up staying at  urlLink Aladdin  for a little more money... but well worth it.  We stayed in the Panorama Suite... 1,255 square feet, 180∞ view of the strip, big screen TV, wet bar, a very nice bathtub that opened out to the room (perfect for Joanne and I to take a bubble bath together, heehee), a separate bedroom with a bath (which Joanne and I crashed in), etc.  It was so much fun, I don't know where to begin.  There were a total of 11 girls staying in the suite.  7 of us rode up to Vegas in a rental van on Friday... Freida, Marsh, Kristine, Irena, Jackie, Joanne, and me.  We got there around 5pm.  We gawked at our suite, and then chilled for a bit before getting ready for our night at  urlLink Rain .  Janelle, Monica, Suzette, and Janette came up eventually.  Of course, most of us got pretty drunk before we left the room.  We were on the guestlist, and were lucky to come across some $10 tickets, so we got in pretty quickly.  It got crowded pretty fast.  I met some guy from San Diego who is going to be opening a bar downtown... I forgot what it's called... Shotbar?  I totally forgot.  He was pretty cool, but he really got down with Mon.  After dancing, we ate somewhere... not sure where, I was drunk, and a little sick (I started gagging in the bathroom).  I couldn't eat my steak and eggs.  But poor Irena was more sick than me, and ended up throwing up at our table!  Well, that was Friday night for the most part.  Saturday...  I will have to continue later because I keep getting sidetracked!

       CONGRATULATIONS to Cindy on her engagement !  Dimitri proposed to Cindy this past Saturday, and the wedding is set for March 27, 2004... which so happens to be Jerel's birthday.  Jerel asked if he could get really drunk, since he'll be celebrating two occasions.  John & Freida's  urlLink wedding  is in a little over a month.  They asked me to be an usher, so I better look good.  Bachelorette party 2003 is this weekend!  Joanne got her summer school refund so it's a go...  urlLink Olympic Garden  here we come, hahahaha!  I'm so excited!  We leave this Friday, and we'll be staying at  urlLink Bally's .  Jerel and some other guys will be staying at  urlLink Imperial Palace .  Man, I can't believe it... our friends are getting married... Jennifer said, "You know what that means..." and I was like, "What does that mean?"  She said, "You're next."  Of course Jerel said, "No."  And Jenn said, "I didn't say with Jerel."  Hahahahaha!!!  Take that, sucker!  I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

      Okay, here it goes.  I have tried very hard to understand men and their fascination with strippers.  But, I think I've failed once again.  If only boyfriends could really understand what some girlfriends go through when they know that their significant other is going off to a strip club or bachelor party to pay another girl to dance naked for them.  I try to be a great girlfriend by letting Jerel do what he wants without going crazy or telling him that he can't do certain things.  It's something I've learned from my relationship with Jason-- I tripped out when he would go to a strip club, and we weren't even really together at the time.  Now with Jerel, I don't want him to feel like he has to hide things from me in order to save me from being hurt; I would much rather know the truth rather than be kept in the dark because then that would only make my imagination run amuck.  It's better to take things on and try to understand the situation.  But of course, it's risky because what if I ultimately don't understand or agree?  I feel that I'm pretty accepting.  For a long time, I accepted how Jason didn't want a serious commitment.  But after so long, you begin to feel that you've accepted too much where you feel taken for granted.  I'm not saying that it's the same with Jerel.  What I'm trying to get at is that it has taken me a lot of thinking, patience, and understanding to be where I'm at today; I trust Jerel and do not feel the need to tell him he shouldn't go to strip clubs.  It's a great accomplishment for me to know that I don't attempt to control him like a nasty, jealous girlfriend.  But it still hurts.  You can't help but wonder how your boyfriend could go and pay some naked stranger to dance on his lap and get a cheap feel, while you are back at home waiting for him.  I've heard the excuses-- it's only entertainment; it doesn't mean anything; I don't care about her like I care about you; [insert excuse]; blah blah blah.  Sometimes you can't help but wonder, is it really cheating?  It takes an immense amount of security to let one go off and do this.  I've felt that I'm secure enough.  But now I'm beginning to doubt myself.  Am I insecure?  Do I really trust him?  It bothers me that... this bothers me.  I don't want to trip over this.  So what's the problem?  Last night, I asked Jerel that if the 3 dances he got were only lap dances.  He said yes.  Then I made sure he didn't lick any of them.  And he said no.  He started to get annoyed.  But shit, when your boyfriend says, "If I wanted you to know, I would've told you."  And you say, "Are you saying you don't want me to know?" and he says, "Not really," you cannot help but wonder if he has something to hide.  I just cannot help it.  I belive in being open about everything.  I don't want to hide shit.  But I know we had an understanding that he didn't want to tell me what happened at the bachelor party.  I completely understand that.  I know there's this secret code for men where you just don't tell women what happens.  Yet I don't want to know about everyone else, I don't care.  I just want to know what he did, and not even the details.  Argh.  It's so hard.  He feels annoyed because I was okay with it before.  Yet that night, I didn't sleep until 4am.  This past week has been a struggle.  It's bothered me more than I thought it would.  It just isn't that easy to let things go, especially when you're doing laundry, and you smell another girl on his clothes.  It's really disheartening.  Most girls want to feel like they are the only one their boyfriend looks at.  But boys are boys, oh, I mean dogs.  Jason once told me that it would take a lot for a man to look at just one girl for the rest of his life.  I don't think any girl fits that position, just like there isn't any man who would look at one girl.  It's sad.

      Finished  Chamber of Secrets  and now starting  Prisoner of Azkaban .  I've read that J.K. Rowling put in a lot of subtle hints in the 2nd book, so I was trying to read it carefully.  I see a lot of the little details mentioned that popped up in the 5th book, but I wonder if there's a lot more?

      Back when I was trying to get to the source of the fruit fly infestation, I started throwing out all the garbage possible.  Earlier last week, I discovered that there had been extra trash inside a garbage can that we supposedly haven't been using because we didn't have a big enough trash bag.  When I opened it, I immediately saw little things crawling inside so I took it out to the patio.  I left it there for almost a week, and remember it's been a pretty hot week here... so since tomorrow is trash day, I decided to try to empty it into the large garbage can... and phew!!!  That thing STINKS.  So I had John empty it for me.  I just finished rinsing it out with water.  After it dries tomorrow, I'm gonna put a hefty coat of Lysol on it.  Aside from the fruit fly infestation, our sink began to smell  really  bad.  I took Jerel's advice and poured some bleach down the drain.  It helped a lot.  So, our place is on its way to becoming somewhat clean again... I hope.  I feel extremely dirty and a little sick from the smell.     I'm gonna go take a nice long shower, right now.

      I finished  Sorceror's Stone  2 days ago, and I'm now reading  Chamber of Secrets .  It's nice to pick up on things I forgot and missed; it makes me go, "Ohhhh...."

      Jerel went to Bachelor party #2 last night.  It was at Johnny's brother-in-law's house, so you know what that means... ugh.  I go through periods of being cool with it and not so cool.  I couldn't sleep last night.  I don't know why, it's not like I don't trust Jerel.  It's just the thought of strippers at a private party... so different from a strip club.  Yech.  Anyway, I just ended up staying in Irvine doing my toenails and reading Harry Potter.  Woohoo!  The SD gang went out last night to Yardhouse downtown since Nori is down from Japan.  I was too lazy to make the drive to SD.  But I actually have to go today because my mom says that I need to bring my dad so he can sign some papers for the Tax Board.  Maybe when Jerel gets here, we can go and then stop at Anthony's for some fish and chips.

      Jerel called me just awhile ago to tell me, "We're going to the parade next year." I said, "What parade?" He says, "The Laker Parade."  So Karl Malone decided to  urlLink jump on board , too.  Shaq, Kobe, Payton, and Malone... crazy.  Imagine all the money Payton and Malone could have gotten if they signed somewhere else!  But I guess they want that ring a whole lot more.

      Wow, yesterday I got the most site traffic ever.  I was wondering how that could be and I realized it must be Friendster!  People looking at my profile must be wondering, "What the hell is in that hand?!"  It's my hamster, Weezer!  Isn't she cute?!  UPDATE: I was wrong, it's not just Friendster.  I know a lot of it is from Jen's site, but apparently a lot of people are searching for that Quizno's free sub coupon.  Or something like that.  Heehee.

      There is a major fruit fly problem in my house.  I've been trying to clear most of the trash out, but they're still there.  I gotta find more sources of the problem.  Once I get home, I'm going to really clean the place... I figure I owe that much to my roommates since they moved my car last night while I was in LA.  I got pissed off yesterday after I got home from work.  When I went into my bathroom (where the fly problem spread) there were 3 flies on my toothbrush!  I got so pissed, I didn't care about killing them with my hands-- I just started slamming my hand into the mirror whenever I saw them land.  Oooh, it's war.

      I've decided that before I read stuff on my list below, I'm going to reread all of the Harry Potter books.  I want to see what I missed.  It's been 3 years since I read the first one, I think.  I'm almost done rereading the Sorceror's Stone.

      You know what's really good?  The new Cheetos Twisted.  It's like Puffs but bigger, twisted, a little denser, and a lot more cheesier.  More surface area for the cheese to adhere to.  It's sooo good.  We first had them for 4th of July at Ron and Janelle's place.  I just bought a small bag from Zot n Go.  I was so happy when I saw them today (I looked for them yesterday, but they weren't there).  It's deceiving to eat though... you think haven't had a lot because the pieces are so big, but it's actually pretty filling.  I'm trying to stick to the serving size of the package.  Anyway, they're repaving my street Wednesday and Thursday.  So guess what that means... I have to move my Celica.  It's been parked in the same spot since October.  The battery is completely dead now.  I have to push it into the garage later on.  Argh.

      I created another blog!  In addition to this one and  urlLink Let's Go Fatty! , there's  urlLink What's Next? , a blog about what to do after school... or actually, when you have time to do anything other than work or school.  I really need to take time to do some meaningful stuff in life, so here's where I can put it down and go back to it when I need a refresher.  Hope it sparks motivation and/or inspiration!

      I was a pitiful English major.  Out of the many books I needed to read, I probably only finished 10, more or less.  Besides having these assigned books, there are many others that I think I just need to read.  There may be some on this list that I read when I was younger, but forgot.  So I may as well read them again.  Okay, here it goes... there's a lot (I'm staring at my bookshelf):       The Catcher in the Rye  by J.D. Salinger    Lord of the Rings  Trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien    The Hobbit  by J.R.R. Tolkien (reread)    The Chronicles of Narnia  by C.S. Lewis                  The Magician's Nephew           The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe  (reread)          The Horse and His Boy           Prince Caspian           Voyage of the Dawn Treader           The Silver Chair           The Last Battle             The Odyssey  (reread)    The Divine Comedy  by Dante Alighieri (finish all 3)                  Inferno           Purgatorio           Paradiso             Dracula  by Bram Stoker (finish)    The Cantebury Tales  by Chaucer    Siddhartha  by Hermann Hesse    Pamela  by Samuel Richardson (finish)    Cloud 9  by Caryl Churchill    Lord Jim  by Joseph Conrad (finish)    The Last of the Mohicans  by James Fenimore Cooper    Robinson Crusoe  by Daniel Dafoe (finish)    Auschwitz and After  by Charlotte Delbo    The Sketch Book  by Washington Irving    The Drowned and the Saved  by Primo Levi (finish)    Autobiography of Angela Davis  by Angela Davis (finish)    Paradise Lost  by John Milton (finish)    Lolita  by Vladimir Nabokov (almost finished... ugh)    Hamlet  by William Shakespeare (reread)    The Merchant of Venice  by William Shakespeare (finish)    A Midsummer Night's Dream  by William Shakespeare (finish)    The House of Mirth  by Edith Wharton (finish)    A Voice from the South  by Anna Julia Cooper (finish)    Maria  by Mary Wollstonecraft (finish)    Inside Daisy Clover  by Gavin Lambert (finish)    The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man  by James Weldon Johnson (finish)    Sister Carrie  by Theodore Dreiser (finish)    The Outsiders  by S.E.

      Sorry, I couldn't think of another title. I created this list right before I went to Italy for the summer in 2001. I've updated the list to reflect what I've done, and also added a few more things.   Not in any particular order:       go to Italy  [traveled June-September 2001]   skydive   bungee jump; not in just any place, but in Switzerland like I was supposed to!   ride in a hot air balloon   learn to surf   learn to ride a motorcycle   learn to really defend myself   get in a girl fight-- I know this sounds funny, but I've always wanted to get in a fight with a girl and see how I do. I wouldn't start it on purpose; we'd have to be fighting for a good reason. Hopefully this isn't what I do right before I die!   go to New York for New Year's   go to Hawaii   go to New Orleans for Mardi Gras   go back to Venice for Carnivale   see the Sistine Chapel, I missed it when I went to The Vatican   attend a mass given by the Pope   gamble in Las Vegas--for real    go to a stripclub  [went 2 times: Sept/Oct 2001? and March 2002 for Jerel's birthday]   approach a guy that I think is cute and buy him a drink--if he's not interested, at least I tried [okay, I can't do this now since I'm with Jerel!]   write a book, get published   have at least one of my photographs published in a magazine    have my artwork in a gallery/show  [Dec 2002: Senior Exhibition; Apr 2003: slideshow in Starbucks, group show in Star Shoes]   draw what you see when you travel--at least 1 scene from each town, and take a picture of what you drew [I kind of did this in Venice]   be committed to do some volunteer work for a set amount of time   when I have my own house, have the following rooms:     library   studio/dark room   music room     learn to pole dance   master Italian (gotta keep practicing... can't let it go for nothing!)   learn more languages: German, Japanese, Chinese, Latin...   swim in a lake/near a beautiful waterfall   go white water rafting   go on a cross-country trip by car   run in a short marathon for a good cause   learn to play the drums, other instruments other than piano   learn to paint watercolor     That's it for now. I'll update it as I go along!

      Well, I've been out of school for 3 months now.  What have I been up to?  Work.  I had said to myself that once I'm out of school, I'd have time to do the things I wanted: read, work out, etc.  Have I done these things?  Not really.  So... here I go.  I believe to start things, you gotta plan.  Working out:  see  urlLink Let's Go Fatty  for any progress (not much as of yet!!!).  But here... here is where I'll put my top lists of what I want to do.  I have 2 lists in mind at the moment.  First, of course, is "Things To Do Before I Die."  Gotta live it, you know?  Second list is "Books to Read."  Having been an English major and completely wasting it (well, I didn't exactly waste my time, but I certainly didn't put enough effort into finishing the literature assigned), I really want to read it all: Classics, new stuff, etc.  I've always liked to read and write... it was when I started having somewhat of a social life, school, and work that I lost time for reading and writing.  If I'm going to publish a book one of these days, I better get my mind going.

      Well, I didn't get to watch Charlie's Angels, but I'm going up to LA tonight to watch it with Jerel.  This weekend was fun.  It got off to a slow start in terms of actually getting there, but it was fun.  Jerel ended up taking me to  urlLink Hearst Castle .  We tried to go there before while we were shooting footage for my senior exhibition video, but the 2 times we went, it was closing.  So we drove up to the Central Coast on Saturday.  Our reservation was at 11am, but we were so tired we kept switching it to a later time.  We ended up having to postpone it to Sunday morning.  We stayed at the  urlLink Days Inn San Luis Obispo .  It was actually pretty nice; we had a room with 2 queens originally reserved.  Then as Jerel was checking in, I asked him why we got a room with 2 queen size beds.  He began to tell me that for some reason, a room with 1 king size bed was more expensive.  After he said this, the man checking us in decided to upgrade us to a suite with a king bed at no additional charge.  It was cool; it had a little kitchen, sitting room, and separate bedroom.  It was quaint.  Before we actually checked into our hotel, Jerel and I went to Giovanni's in Morro Bay.  It's this little place where we've gotten fish & chips whenever we're in the area.  I nearly got shit on by a seagull (bastard!).  At least it didn't get me, Jerel got one in the head last time.  Anyway, Jerel also bought a bottle of wine there, and then we went searching for wine glasses (we found some at a local Rite-Aid).  Jerel and I had some wine and cheese later that night.  Then Sunday morning we took  urlLink Tour 1  at Hearst Castle.  We saw the pools and inside a small guesthouse, the "living room," the dining room (which was lined with all of the Siena contrade flags, I was so excited!), and more.  Jerel wanted to see the gardens; we only saw a small part of it.  So we'll probably go again and take a different tour.  We had some bbq, and then fell asleep during a movie about William Hearst.  Then after, we started driving south to Solvang where we got some pastries, and then to Buellton where we had Split Pea Soup at  urlLink Anderson's .  We also had more bbq (we had tri-tip sandwiches) and it was really good!  After that, we made our way home.  It was a really nice way to spend our 1-year anniversary.

      I got my Asics on Friday!  Friday!  And I ordered them on Wednesday night!  How cool is that?  Well, it's too bad I have to exchange one of them; it's a bit too small.  Oh, and then Jerel was nice enough to also buy me a new pair of brown New Balances!  What a sweetie.  Then last night, we took a trip to Tower Records after coming up from San Diego and bought the new Dashboard Confessional CD.  They're having a sale on all Dashboard CDs for $9.99!  So we came up on the MTV unplugged v2.0 also.  The cds are great 'cause they come with DVDs.  Jerel kept saying, "All this for only $9.99!" over and over while we watched them.  I can't wait until the concert in September.

      I'm currently reading 2 books:  Goblet of Fire  and  She's Come Undone  by Wally Lamb.  Nicole lent it to me; she told me the synopsis and it sounded really interesting.  So far, the story of Dolores Price is nutty.  I can't help but feel for her, but at the same time the girl can be such a bitch!  I'm only into the first 50 pages or so, so we'll see.

      A few months ago, I had wanted to buy these  urlLink Asics  shoes.  Well, the other day I visited my dad and Allan.  Allan just finished designing some snowboard gear for Asics, and he got hooked up with some shoes.  I had asked him to get me the ones I wanted, but he didn't get to.  Instead, he gave me the pair that he was supposed to give to Angela.  Hey, I don't care if it was for her, I just came up with some new kicks.  They are part of the  urlLink Onitsuka Tiger  series, Mexico 66, in black/grey/gold.  Anyway, I showed them to my sister, and she started complaining about how come she didn't get a pair.  She started looking online for some Asics and came across the ones I wanted!  She found them on  urlLink Zappos.com , which is weird because when I checked there a couple of months ago, they didn't have them in stock.  They were supposed to notify me when they were in, but oh well.  Anyways, I ended up ordering the  urlLink Top Sevens  I wanted in sandstone/dark brown, along with these, the  urlLink Onitsuka Tiger by Asics X-Caliber GT  in black/natural.  Nice, huh?

      Well, it's Saturday night, and I decided to stay home and clean my room.  Charleen and Joanne went to Century Club, and Jerel's at the poker tournament.  I've been folding the pile of clothes in my room and sorting, and I eventually uncovered my chest of photos.  I started going through the photos of my summer in Italy... those were some of the best days of my life.  I was also a lot healthier back then... all the water I drank, hiking/running/walking everywhere, running after trains, eating reasonable portions of food... aah... it was the life.  I wish I could go back, soon.

      I am sick of Jerel not listening to me.  We were just discussing the weekend earlier, and he mentioned how X-Games is here in LA.  He said maybe we'd go Sunday.  I said, "Oh, well I'm not gonna be here Sunday, so have fun."  And he's like, "What do you mean you're not going to be here Sunday?"  I told him I had to be in San Diego for Cindy's lunch on Sunday.  And he's all, "I thought that was on Saturday."  I was like, "No, it's Sunday, I told you."  And he started saying, "No you didn't, you said it was Saturday."  I CLEARLY told him, Tuesday night when I came to visit him in LA, when I first found out, that I was going to San Diego for the weekend.  Cindy wanted the bridal party to meet on SUNDAY for LUNCH so we can meet each other and discuss the details of the wedding.  I remember what I told him:  I said that I was going to San Diego this weekend.  He asked why.  I told him about the lunch on SUNDAY.  I asked if he wanted to go to San Diego, but he said he has an orthodontist appointment and that he might go to the Poker Tournament (Saturday night).  Then, I asked if he didn't go to the poker thing, would he go?  He said he wanted to take care of stuff at his house.  So I said fine.  Then he asked if I was going to come back up to LA because it was my turn to drive Monday morning.  I complained because that meant I had to drive from San Diego to LA Sunday night, then back to Irvine Monday morning.  I did that last week, and it's a lot of f-ing driving.  He was like, so what?  He did it this past weekend.  Point is, I TOLD HIM IT WAS SUNDAY.  And he has the nerve to argue with me that I told him it was on Saturday?!  There was never a question that the LUNCH would be any other day other than SUNDAY!  I told him the Poker Tournament was SATUDAY NIGHT.  He had asked if I was going to go to the tournament, but I said that I probably wouldn't go because I didn't have $50 to buy in.  Now, if there was no way that I could go, wouldn't I have said, "No I can't go because I'm having dinner with Cindy Saturday night?"  Geez!  I got really pissed.  I'm calm now, but shit!  It really pissed me off because I KNOW I TOLD HIM IT WAS ON SUNDAY!!!!!  SHIT!  ARGH!  I know I sound ridiculous, but it really pisses me off when I tell him things and he claims I didn't, or I said something else.  It drives me fucking crazy.

      I always wanted to try out for "The Real World."  It'd be interesting.  I'd probably be the sob story girl, or the one who's in the middle of everyone's fights.  But I'm almost out of the 18-24 age bracket, so too bad for me.  But the next season is gonna be in San Diego... can't wait to watch that one.  I haven't been paying much attention to the series (I contribute it to my "old" age... seems like I'm becoming a VH-1 person hahaha), but when it airs in January 2004, I'm definitely watching.  How can I not watch it when it's in my hometown?  They supposedly begin taping this month, and rumor is the house is in Point Loma.  Not that'd I'd go staking it out, but it'd be nice to be hanging out downtown and seeing some sort of craziness.  I don't care to be on camera or anything (I'd hate to be a groupie, so lame), but I'd just like to see how it works.

      Called my mom a little while ago... she just bought a mini-dv camcorder and wanted me to tell her if it was okay or not.  I looked it up and it was fine, but then we started talking about marriages and all... she wondered who out of us kids would get married first.  I told her how I don't think any of us will be getting married any time soon.  Then she had to go on and say, "Maybe I'll get married first."  "Mom, I don't want to talk about that right now."  "Okay, okay... You know, Steven will be getting out soon."  "That's... that's great mom.  Uh... when?"  "Well, he'll probably have a date set in October for a hearing, and then probably 6 months from then..."  "Uh, okay."  "Will you go to my wedding if we get married?"  "Mom, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT."  "Okay."  Ugh!  I'll deal with that when the moment comes, but the thought just gave me a sick feeling in my stomach.  And to imagine him as my step-father?  HELL NO.  I've thought about the possibility of them getting married, but I don't think I could ever attend.  It's just too much.  Then, what if one of us gets married eventually?  How is that going to work out?  I wouldn't want him and my wedding.  *SHUDDER*  I cannot think about this right now, it's disturbing.  My stomach feels funny.

      I've been gettin' lazy with photography... it's time to go shooting and get my "creative juices" flowin' again (so clichÈ).  Possible projects and things I've been wanting to do:      Family portraits:  I've always thought about the messed up relationships in my family--Allan and my mom, Allan and Robert, Mom and Dad... it'd be interesting to get each together for a sitting.    My old neighborhood:  I've done a project of my old San Diego neighborhood, but what I really wanted to do was haul out some of the old furniture from back in the day (my aunt and mom still have some!) and photograph myself reliving moments from my childhood.  A really extensive project would include shooting at night, but that could be a little scary; it's not exactly the best neighborhood to be hanging out in after dark anymore.  (Thanks to Ken for the night idea!)    Still life:  Nothing special in mind yet, but just to practice with lighting and composition.    Landscape:  I wanted to take some shots out in the desert, or some other really deserted place.    Night shots:  There's a spot Jerel showed me up in LA that views downtown from an overpass... it's an amazing spot.  I'd love to take the 4x5 there and shoot at night.     That's what I can brainstorm at the moment.  I'll think of some more as I go along!

      Okay, okay... so I caught most of Fox's new show,  urlLink The O.C. .  Jerel actually called me 15 minutes into the show and told me to start watching and tell him what's going on (he had started watching it at Johnny's but was picked up by Chris, so he started to get intrigued yet interrupted).  Even though I had wanted to watch it to see how Orange County was portrayed, I was lazy at first and didn't want to get up.  But he urged me to, and after I said how gay he was, I sat down in front of the new TV and started watching.  So, the verdict?  I actually like the show.  Sure, it portrays Newport Beach as this ultra hip, party town with snobby rich kids and all, and then Chino as a dump-- but having lived here for the past 6 years, it really isn't all that bad.  It's just a TV show, just like "90210."  Every place has its snobs and poor kids.  I did check out the website, and it is  extremely  superficial, but it's just going along with the theme of the show.  I'm intrigued.  I think I'll watch this show regularly.  Later, I talked to Jerel and it turns out he wasn't able to catch the rest of the show.  Personally, I think the guys might be watching it just to check out hot white chicks in bikinis.

      I never really thought I'd be a regular, but I go to  urlLink Coffee Bean  practically every single day.  The only thing is that the one staff worker that recognized me works a different shift now, and I never see him anymore.  He and another worker used to hook me up all the time.  But now, I see different workers everyday, and they never remember my name.  Hmm.  I think they only remember the pretty ones =)

      Well, I'm still upset about what I found out yesterday.  I'm ready to kick some ass.  I cannot wait to bump into her.  Neither can my sister.  She keeps saying how Angela better stay out of her way 'cause Charleen is gonna fuckin'  kick her ass .  Oh man, she messed with the wrong family.  She better move to another state, the fucking skank.  Anyway, this past weekend was okay.  I left work early on Friday to run some errands before heading to SD.  I had an unfortunate experience with Rudy while checking out some photo equipment.  He was pretty pissed off at me 'cause I bothered him during his off-hours, but we talked today and everything is cool.  Afterwards, I went to Petco to buy some chinchilla bath sand for Weezer.  He has a tendency to pee in her wheel, which is making her extremely dirty when I don't have the time to clean his cage.  So I read that the bath sand will help absorb some of the dirt.  I hope.  I didn't get a chance to look at him before work, hopefully it helped a bit.  I went to SD for Michelle's mom's going-away dinner.  I had some good food, drank, and smoked some cigars.  The next day, CJ stopped by with some Starbucks and we all chatted for a bit about Saved by the Bell and how it's gonna be coming out on  urlLink DVD .  We also had a good laugh about lines from "Kickboxer," "Blood Sport," and "Double Impact."  I was running late getting to LA, bothering Jerel a bit.  It took me a good 2 hours to meet up at Johnny's house.  We looked at old pictures from their high school years that Freida and Johnny are planning to include in the slideshow for the wedding.  Later on, Jerel and I skipped out on going to Ron's and ended up watching "Punch-drunk Love."  Strange, but good movie.  Jerel got a good laugh out of the "Mattress Man commercial."  For anyone who's watched it: what did the Harmonium represent?  Sunday, we slept for a long time.  I was upset because we didn't get to shoot; I went through all that trouble of getting the photo equipment for the past two weeks for nothing.  Jerel promised he would plan better next time.  Then Johnny, Freeds, Jerel, and I ate dinner at Marie Calendar's.  Monday, I went to Irvine in the morning, worked, and came back up for Jerel's dad's birthday.  We got food from Full House and then went to the valley.  Deja was  very  happy to see Jerel; his new jeans smell like her, haha.  We took her for a walk around the block.  When we got back to Kingsley, Johnny, Gib, and Chris were jammin' in the back.  Of course, Jerel wanted to scare Gib again.  He ended up turning the lights off and scaring him while Johnny and Chris went to go investigate.  Later we were all outside talking and looking at the stars (I know that sounds gay, but it was pretty funny).  We talked about the ride home from Vegas again (hehehe).  Then they started talking about Johnny being "Jizza" (did I spell that right?) and Jerson saying, "Suck your toe, bitch!"  I have no idea what these things mean, but they sure got a good laugh out of it.  I came back to Irvine this morning and went to work again.  That's it in a nutshell.  I'm tired.

      I just may get my chance to get in a girl fight.  I just found out my brother's "girlfriend" cheated on him.  He caught her in bed with someone else.  I just told Jerel that if we ever see her in public, he better hold me back 'cause I'm gonna  knock her the fuck out.

      I was planning to write about my weekend, but I decided to check my email and Friendster messages first and had the displeasure of reading one of the most painful messages from my brother.  I just found out that Angela cheated on my brother.  ANGELA CHEATED ON ALLAN.  What am I supposed to say to him?  It was one of the most painful things I've ever had to read.  And mind you, I'm at work right now, and I just started crying.  He decided to surprise her one night and instead he caught her in bed with someone else.  Fuck.  And what really got to me was that Allan wrote how I had warned him... and the last sentence in his message was, "I should have listened to you Debbie."  Again, what am I supposed to say?  I'm hurting a lot for my brother.  He says he really loved her.  I was hoping she had changed.  But I guess she is and always will be the same person.  The fucking bitch.  I thought I didn't like Karla, but now Karla looks like a fucking saint next to Angela.  The fucking bitch.  She better watch out if I ever see her in public, I'm gonna knock her the fuck out of her if she crosses me the wrong way.

      Ah, today I didn't feel too good.  I went into work around 8:30 am (the parking structure was already full!) and ended up leaving an hour later 'cause I felt like vomiting.  I think I ate something bad last night- I tried to make Paat Thai using some mix from 99 Ranch, added an egg, and even though it tasted okay, I felt weird later on.  So I went home (after going to Target to buy this eyeshadow that I wanted) and slept.  I felt a lot better after sleeping, but was still plagued with a runny nose.  I didn't get too much sleep 'cause I was talking to Jason last night until 2 am or so.  After, I was hungry so I ended up getting some take-out from Tenko.  Mmm, it was good- Crunch roll and a 2-item combo of Sesame Chicken and Salmon Teriyaki.  I didn't eat the combo yet, I'm saving it for lunch tomorrow.  After eating, I read a little and ended up falling asleep again!  So now I'm well rested and unable to sleep.  My nose has been running all day.  I talked to Jerel and he said he had allergies today also.  I guess it's in the air today.

      Saw  urlLink Dashboard Confessional  last night at Universal Amphitheater, and it was a great show.  A bit too loud, but still great (Rhinocechris was right, the guitar was piercing to the ear).  We got there late due to a few setbacks, so we missed everyone else: Vendetta Red, Brand New, and MxPx (well, most of MxPx.  We saw a little).  I was a bit disappointed, but hey, I was there to see Dashboard.  Gib bought me a Dashboard t-shirt (green with a helicopter screen print on the front) and I got myself a double Jack & Coke.  $11!!!  Oh well.  It set me straight for a little while.  I believe Chris Carraba opened up with "The Sharp Hint Of New Tears" if I remember correctly.  Ah, I wish I remembered the set, but of course I'm still learning the lyrics to the new CD.  It was amazing to see the amount of people there.  I'm glad I was able to see him in a more intimate venue (well, Epicentre, which is small).  I remembering him just hanging out in the crowd while the other bands were playing at that concert.  Too bad I didn't talk to him when I had the chance.  Now I'll never get that chance again, considering how much bigger they've gotten since watching them in 2001.  Well, I belted out the lyrics to all the songs I knew.  Of course, with "The Best Deceptions," Jerel replaced "kiss" with "fuck."  I think a lot of other people did, too =)  When they stepped off the stage before the encore, the crowd got  deafening .  My ears were ringing, I actually had to cover them for awhile.  Crazy.  They closed with "Hands Down."  My favorite CD is still  The Swiss Army Romance .  That CD got me through some tough times.  Chris is cute =)  Here's the songs I remember being played (in no particular order... I'll add more as I remember):  "The Sharp Hint Of New Tears" "Screaming Infidelities" "Again I Go Unnoticed" "The Best Deceptions" "Hands Down" "Saints And Sailors" "Carry This Picture" "Am I Missing" "The Good Fight" Cover of Wheatus' "Teenage Dirtbag" "The Brilliant Dance"  UPDATE: "Rapid Hope Loss" "As Lovers Go" "Bend and Not Break" "Ghost of a Good Thing" "Several Ways to Die Trying" (I think?)  That's all I can remember!

      Man, I am way too honest.  After doin' some shopping to relieve the stress of the day, I went to KFC for some dinner.  I went inside 'cause I wasn't sure if I would have enough money.  Anyway, I ordered a 2-piece chicken meal for $4.19.  Turns out I had enough, but first I handed the cashier $3 bills and a Susan B. Anthony $1 coin (thanks to the Metrolink ticket machines).  Before I can hand her $0.20, she gives me back $0.81.  I'm like, oh wait a minute, I only gave you $4.  She looks at me like I'm crazy as I give her back the money, with the 20 cents I owe.  My conscience weighs heavily on me.  Anyway, here was my weekend.  Friday night, I took Metrolink/Red Line to Jerel's work.  We had some Taco Bell for dinner, then I pretty much just passed out 'cause I was tired.  Saturday, Jerel, Chris, and I went to Santa Monica for the  urlLink Red Bull Flugtag .  Oh but before that, we stopped at Coffee Bean on Larchmont, and guess who we saw?  Andy Richter.  Jerel wasn't sure it was him until he spoke, "See ya later guys!"  Aw, wish I could've said hi to him, but oh well.  So there was Flugtag.  It was pretty funny.  Most of the contraptions we saw fell straight into the water.  The winner, When Pigs Fly, glided gracefully into the water.  We stayed long enough for me to get sunburned and get another nasty-ass tan on top of my permanent wife-beater from fishing back in May.  We had a late lunch at Hot Dog on a Stick (I forgot how good the Cherry Lemonade is), and then headed back to LA.  That night, I went with Jerel to a little going-away bbq for one of his co-workers.  Tried a vaporizer for the first time.  Man, that was smooth ;)  Then after the party, Jerel, Gib, and I met up with Johnny, Freeds, Ron, Marsh, Monica and all at a bar (Ye Rustic Inn?).  Sunday, we slept in a bit, but got up in time to get ready for the last Dodger home game against the Giants.  My god, it was hot.  I bought 8 bleacher tickets a couple of months ago.  We had a few balls fly our way (hehe) but we didn't get any.  Jerel bought me a new LA hat to go along with my Dodger shirt.  But I still refuse to wear it in San Diego.  Dodgers won, and we didn't win any fan appreciation prizes.  Boo.  Jerel and I went back to Irvine Sunday night (since it was his turn to drive).  We had Tenko for dinner, and of course did laundry.  We applied aloe gel to each others' sunburned faces.  Jerel has 'coon eyes hahaha!  Anyway, Monday came and Joanne and I spent our evening at Barnes and Noble reading  Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me.   Tuesday, work work work!  I'm tired.  I'm going now.

       o∑pin∑ion:  A belief or conclusion held with confidence but not substantiated by positive knowledge or proof: ìThe world is not run by thought, nor by imagination, but by opinionî (Elizabeth Drew).  Jerel and I have our difference in opinions.  But for him to say that he's right and I'm wrong based on his opinion does not settle well with me.  My belief is that neither of us are right or wrong; we just have a different opinion.  I respect his opinion by not saying he's wrong.  I do not believe he is wrong, and I don't think I'm right.  But when he says I'm wrong, I feel like all that I have said in defense of what happened a long time ago makes no difference to him and that he does not respect my opinion.  It's frustrating.  It makes me question a lot of things.

      Haven't posted in a week, been pretty preoccupied.  As I said before, Fall quarter is coming and it's getting really busy at work.  So many packets to prepare!  I feel so exhausted by the end of the day.  But I hate when I get home, eat dinner, and fall asleep.  I feel so unproductive.  And of course, I still haven't signed up for 24 Hour Fitness yet.  This paycheck went to rent and bills, so I'm gonna have to wait until next Wednesday.  I have to pay first and last months dues, which is why I want to hold off.  I realized last week that it's been 2 years since I got back from Italy.  It seems so long ago... but I look at the pictures and I feel like a totally different person.  Back then I was so free... not that I'm not anymore, but I am more settled.  Sometimes I feel like I'm getting restless though, like I need to get up and move.  One night I was asking Jerel if he wanted to stay in LA for the rest of his life.  When he said yes, it kinda bothered me.  I don't know.  I guess I just feel like I don't want to end up settling in LA.  I like travelling, experiencing other cultures.  I hope when I retire, I'll be able to do that again, with Jerel.  Then after I realized it's been 2 years since Italy, September 11 came around and then I thought about how lucky I was to get back 2 days before the attacks.  What if I had a flight connecting in New York that day?  I definitely would have been flying into LAX, maybe that morning.  It's a scary thought.  I remember CJ was worried 'cause he didn't know when I was flying back.  It seems like a pretty close call.  If my flight was after the 11th, I would have been stuck in Italy for about another 2 weeks or so!  Not like that's a bad situation, but considering I was pretty broke by the end of my trip, I don't know how I would have supported myself.  Friday, I stayed home.  Joanne was over and we just had Arby's.  Then Saturday, I stayed home and fiddled with my computer.  Michelle ended up coming up with Joanne after picking up Julian, so they came over.  I was planning to go to LA for Janelle's birthday, but I decided to stay in Irvine since I haven't kicked it with Michelle in awhile.  Joanne cooked chicken adobo, and we watched Mr. Bean DVDs.  It was pretty chill.  Then after they left, I ended up driving up to LA after all, around 11pm or so.  They ended up having a bbq at Johnny and Freida's (apparently, there was tons of meat).  What was hilarious was that the girls decided to jump in on Jerel taking a shower, with the video camera.  It was funny when they came in (it happened to be a kinda see-through curtain), but what was even funnier was when Jerel decided to jump out of the shower.  The girls ran out screaming.  But somehow, Janelle still got footage.  Hmm?  Haha!  I showed them my pictures from the wedding.  I got shots of Kristian taking a shower in the fountain.  There are some other good shots.  That was just freakin' crazy.  Later that night, we watched version 3 of Johnny's video.  He added more bloopers at the end and changed a few scenes in Vegas.  I never get tired of watching that video.  It's nice to see how all their friends have stayed together over the years.  But they have so much footage!  I hope my video turns out as good as theirs, though with Jerel as editor, I'm sure it'll be cool =)  Sunday, I spent the WHOLE DAY at Jerel's work.  When I say the whole day, I mean from 12:00pm to 12:30am!!!  That's some pretty major overtime.  All I did was go online, check Friendster briefly, watch  BOTH  Lord of the Ring movies, read  She's Come Undone , sleep, eat, sleep some more, watch Conan's 10th anniversary show, the news, sleep, eat.  Oh, and drink a beer.  What a way to spend my Sunday in an office.  It's a nice office, at least =)  I ended up driving back to Irvine this morning even though it's Jerel's turn (yeah, that's right, you owe me a week).  Went to work, but I had a headache.  Went home, had me some CPK, and fell asleep reading.  Now I'm awake, and I have an 8-hour day tomorrow.  Blah.

      Another year at UC Irvine is coming up fast, and we're beginning to get really busy here at work.  I feel so drained at the end of the day.  On top of that, I'm feeling some real time suckage from everyone around me.  Aaah!!!

      This weekend, I'm part of  urlLink Pinoy Visions , the video segment of the  urlLink Festival of Philippine Arts and Culture .  The festival runs September 6-7 in San Pedro.  There are two days of screenings I'm involved in: one was this past Wednesday,  urlLink Living Room , and the other is tonight,  urlLink A Fam'ly Affair .  The thing is, I never really thought I'd be part of something like this.  I thought I'd make my film for my  urlLink senior exhibition  and that's it.  But now, being a participant in this makes me wonder if I should continue submitting "Catharsis" into other film festivals.  Also, should I continue making short documentaries?  Narratives?  It goes along with me wanting to write.  It's something I'm going to have to seriously consider.

      Last night, my video was screened at the Visual Communications headquarters, along with several other talented filmmakers.  I arrived late with Jerel, Freida, Johnny, and Ron.  After we watched all of the films, Abe called up the directors that he knew were there (Mia Villanueva, Christine Apa, Arellano, Roman Cortez, and Tracy Tubera), and then he called me up when Wendell informed him that I was present.  We had a short question/answer forum, which I was a little nervous about.  I didn't know that I would be answering questions, but it was a small crowd and it turned out to be really good.  I was happy to get some positive feedback and reactions to my video.  It's pretty inspiring as well to see what other people are making.  I talked briefly to a few of the other filmmakers and some audience members, and everyone was really nice.  I'm excited for tomorrow night at USC, but also nervous 'cause there will probably be a bigger crowd.  We'll see.  We also watched some of the wedding footage afterwards at Ron and Janelle's.  It was hilarious to see what they did to Jerel the night before the wedding.  So pretty, hehehe.

      After one crazy wedding reception, it's back to work.  Johnny and Freida's wedding was so much fun!  It was more than fun, it was nuts.  Nothing like drunk groomsmen and bridesmaids running though fountains, freaking aunties, ripping dresses and vests, and scratching faces.  Can't wait to see more pictures =)  I just got another update on Pinoy Visions set for this week.  Go to  urlLink Visual Communications  for their online program.  I'll have to write more later.  I'm at work.

      These are just 3 things I've experienced this past weekend.  Friday, I spent the day at home relaxing.  That night, I went out to dinner with Joanne, Michelle, and Kristine at  urlLink Felix's .  After, Joanne and Michelle came over, and then we (plus Jerel and John) watched Witchboard just for kicks.  I remember being pretty scared after watching that movie when I was younger.  When I see it now, it's still creepy but funny.  Ah, the days of playing Ouija.  Anyway, Saturday morning, Jerel and I left for San Diego.  I walked out to a dark sky and a layer of ash on my car.  We were supposed to meet up with the guy who was gonna buy Jerel's extra tickets to the concert at the Chula Vista Mall.  Around Del Mar, we almost got into an accident!  We were in the fast lane, with a good amount of space from the car in front of us.  Jerel happened to be calling Ron at the moment.  All of a sudden, the cars in front of us slammed on their brakes.  Jerel slammed on the brakes, and as my brakes locked, we ended up skidding a good long ways to the car in front of us, who was stopped.  Jerel and I were like, "OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH SSSSSHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTT!!!" and in the last couple of seconds, we really thought we were gonna hit the car.  But by some miracle, we stopped a mere inch or so away from the back of the car.  Amazing.  But with my brakes locking, my tires got FUCKED.  The tread just burned down to the steel.  So, after we checked out the tires and judged that we could make it the rest of the way to Chula Vista, we drove on some bumpy tires.  We were late exchanging the tickets and the money, but it was cool.  We then went to Discount Tires and got 3 new Michelins to match the new one I got back in January.  Let's just say it cost us a lot of money.  But it's a good thing I have Jerel 'cause there would have been no way for me to pay for all that.  Although I talked to CJ today and he told me that he had some tires.  Damn.  Oh well, it's too late for that now.  Anyway, as we waited for the tires to be changed, we ate at McDonald's across the street and walked around the mall.  I ended up getting a nasty headache and nausea.  After the tires were done, we got a car wash and then went to my mom's to nap before the concert.  Only, my headache didn't go away.  We went to Soma, but before we got there, we stopped at 7-eleven to get a drink and cigarettes.  Only I felt so nauseated that I vomited in a plastic bag in the car.  I don't know what happened, but at least I felt better after that.  We still went to the concert, and Saves the Day was awesome.  They sound even better live.  The times I heard them on late shows like Conan and Jimmy Kimmel, they sounded nervous.  But they totally rocked last night.  What was so awesome was that they did a cover of OutKast's "Hey Ya!"  Nice.  Well, we didn't get to go to Pimp 'n Ho.  We made a quick stop at Valentine's for the potato burrito and a carne asada quesadilla, and went to my mom's.  We slept, and then I woke up, thinking it was 9 am.  But Jason called, and I saw that my phone had already readjusted to 8 am.  He was on his way back from Vegas.  I started watching the news and first learned about the fires.  I was like, great, there's gonna be ash on my car now, and when I get back to Irvine, I'll get more ash all over my car.  But as I kept watching, I realized how serious it was and didn't care about the ash.  I left San Diego around 10:30, and didn't get back to Irvine until a little after 12.  There was traffic around the merge, and the sky looked so dark; different from the red sky I experienced back in high school.  I talked to CJ for a bit, who updated me later on the voluntary evacuation of  urlLink EastLake .  I talked to Jenn later, who was telling me how close it was getting to the freeways.  It was frustrating to be back in Orange County, because they were mostly reporting on the fires up in the LA county.  I only learned of what was going on when I dropped my dad off in Long Beach and listened to KOGO on AM radio.  Pretty eventful.  I've been trying to keep as informed as possible (Jerel called me Fire Central).  Hey, even though I don't live in SD anymore, I care about what goes on.  Especially when one of the fires is near EastLake.  Here's a satellite  urlLink view  of the fires in Southern California, courtesy of the Associated Press.

      I'm not sure if I've mentioned it before, but a when I was young I read this book about medieval mice.  I loved this book.  But when I grew older, and remembered how much I liked this book, my great memory forgot the title.  Well, 18 or so years later, I'm sitting here at work, going over job applications, and this girl talks about literature she liked as a child.  And what do you know-- she mentioned the exact book I was dying to remember!!!  It's the  urlLink Redwall  series by Brian Jacques!  I LOVED it so much, and I was so sad that I didn't remember what it was... I want to hire this girl just for jogging my memory!!!

      Well, it's Thursday... this weekend will be the last of my concert weekends for awhile.  Jerel and I are headed to San Diego to watch  urlLink Saves the Day  at Soma.  Last night, I spent 3 hours reconfiguring Jerel's PayPal account and posting some tickets to the sold out concert on Ebay.  I was so frustrated, long story.  But everything should be cool now.  Tomorrow I have the day off of work, so HOPEFULLY I can relax and get some stuff done.  Got paid yesterday, so I took care of my bills.  I'm excited for Saturday; I haven't been to San Diego in a LONG time.  Maybe Jerel and I could finally get some fish & chips or a potato burrito.  Jen, Joanne, and Tals are going to  urlLink Pimp 'n Ho  Saturday night at the Sports Arena.  I wonder if Jerel and I should meet up with them after the concert?  It's not far from Soma, actually.  Hmm...

      I was supposed to drive up to LA after work to watch  urlLink Jimmy Kimmel Live , but I'm just too tired right now.  I didn't see the time at work 'cause I was in a meeting, so I got out later than expected.  Then I still had to go home 'cause I forgot my driver's license in my other jeans.  By the time I got home, it was 5:30, I had a headache, and I need to be inside the studio by 7:30.  With traffic and parking, it would've been too much of a hassle.  So, I'll probably meet up with Jerel later.  I'm gonna see Saves the Day in SD this Saturday, anyway.  Denise Richards and Trey Parker & Matt Stone are on tonight.  Oh well.  Next time.  Jerel could probably get the hook up anyway, considering the show was already full and he just got the tickets today.

      I'm back at work for this hot, Monday afternoon.  The weekend trip to Sacramento was fun, well, most of it was until Jerel got pissed off at Chris and me.  While we drove up and down the state, Jerel slept most of the time in the back seat, which left Chris and me to just talk about a lot of different things.  When we stopped, Chris and I would be laughing at some stuff, but I guess it kinda made Jerel feel left out.  So when we got back to LA, Jerel had enough and kinda blew up at me.  But everything is cool now.  Anyway, besides all that, the  urlLink Red Hot Chili Peppers  were awesome.  I lost hearing in my left ear for the night, but it was such a good concert.  The  urlLink ARCO Arena  is a lot smaller than most sports arenas, I think.  Even if you were sitting in the back, you would still have a really good view of the stage.  Jerel figured the reason why it's so loud during the games is that the floor of the stands are all wood, not concrete.  The drive up took us about 6 hours from Jerel's place.  It actually didn't seem that long for Chris and me.  We checked into our hotel, chilled for a bit, and then looked for some place to eat.  Joanne was right, there is nothing to do up there.  We couldn't really find anything.  We ended up eating at Jack in the Box (more fast food).  When we got to the ARCO Arena, we wanted some drinks, so we ordered Rum and "Coke."  The didn't have Coke, so they used Pepsi instead, and it just tasted nasty.  We all couldn't finish our drinks, which says a lot considering it's us who's drinking.  Anyway, we watched a little bit of The Flaming Lips, which was a little strange.  We also each bought a t-shirt.  I got the black t-shirt that has the RHCP logo, wings, and "Red Hot Chili Peppers" encircling it all.  They performed all the great songs, of course.  The energy was amazing.  I especially rocked to "Can't Stop" and "Under the Bridge," of course.  But the next greatest thing, apart from the concert, was right after they finished the encore.  Everyone had walked off the stage except for Flea, who went up to the microphone and said something like this...  "Everyone, I have an announcement to make.  Listen everyone, this is really important...  I'm not in Sacramento often, but it's really important that you hear this..."  Everyone in the arena, happy from the concert, was eagerly waiting for what he has to say, and Flea shouts:  "GO LAKERS!!!  GO LAKERS!!!  LAKERS RULE!!!  PURPLE AND GOLD!!!  SHAQUILLE O'NEAL!!!  YEAH!!!!!!"  He goes on for about a minute amidst the boos, jeers, and middle fingers being thrown at him.  Jerel and I are cheering (along with one other lady somewhere behind us).  Flea continues cheering, and jumps up and down off the stage.  After that whole episode, everyone started filing out of the arena.  We decide to sit down in the stands and wait for everyone to leave, and when we sit down, Jerel and I overheard a girl say, "Why did Flea have to say 'Go Lakers?'  It ruined my whole night!"  We just laughed.  It was a great concert.

      Happy Friday!  Well, Nicole went up to the Bay Area to look at San Jose State for Shannon, so I'm in charge today.  It's already been an eventful morning.  I don't want to say what it is just yet, but definitely within the next week we'll all be hearing of some pretty big news...  For now, I gotta start preparing for my weekend trip to Sacramento.  Jerel, Chris, and I are going to watch the Red Hot Chili Peppers at the Arco Arena.  We don't have a place to stay yet, so either Jerel or I have to make some reservations today.  Joanne tells me it's pretty boring up there, nothing to do.  I guess we'll see when we get there.  Never been to the state capital before, so I guess we'll do a little sightseeing.  It's also Lori's birthday today.  I think they're all going out up in LA tonight.  I don't know if I'll be able to make it since I have to get ready to go.  But maybe I'll head out tonight if there's time.  I can't wait to get the news off my chest.  I've been keeping it inside for too long, it's driving me CRAZY.  Next week, definitely.  Well, hopefully.

      I'm stuck in a rut.  I'm slowly going through  Order of the Phoenix  and  She's Come Undone .  There's so much I need to read, too... what's wrong with me?  Am I slowing down?  Am I becoming too comfortable?  I feel like I need a new challenge to inspire me.  I was thinking of applying to this job in New York, but the posting is gone now.  So I think I'm going to work at the same place for another year... I really hope I don't get stuck.

      Occasionally, I'll search people's names in  urlLink Google  to see if anything comes up.  I just searched Jerel and a logo he made for a  urlLink class  he took at Glendale Community College is up.  Charles and Irwin's stuff is up, too (Charles was the one who originally took the class before).  Jerel never finished the class, but it's cool to see that the teacher put up his work.  I still think he should've animated the logo by having the bull knocked in the head, and his tongue coming out, complete with sound effects.

      I finally got to watch  urlLink Kill Bill  last night.  It was pretty dope.  I would never imagine Uma Thurman in a role like this, but I think she pulled it off pretty well.  I'm also a fan of Lucy Liu; it was cool when she showed everyone who was boss.  Jerel, John, and I watched it at The Block.  Afterwards, we went to Krispy Kreme for some late night doughnuts.  Michelle, Joanne, and Julian were at my place when we left to see the movie.  Joanne called later to let us know that MTA was going on strike.  Jerel and John called their dads to see if they were striking (Jerel's dad is already retired, but they're trying to lessen their benefits, and John's dad I'm not exactly sure about).  Man, what's going on with everybody?  The grocery clerks, sheriff, MTA... what's next?

      My sister can be so weird sometimes.  We all know about the strikes going on with Ralph's, Albertson's, and Vons.  Well, yesterday my sister tried to cross the picket line to buy some milk.  She was hesitant to go in, but when she saw some shoppers walk out with grocery bags, she decided it was okay.  She was still nervous, so she decided to call John on his cellphone and ask what she should do, and also to act as a distractor to the picketers.  So she walks up, and a lady with her baby in a stroller comes up to Charleen and starts saying, "This is my baby, I'm not going to be able to afford healthcare for her... please don't shop here."  My sister, still on the phone, tries to get around her (meanwhile, John doesn't pick up so it goes to his voicemail) and gets surrounded by 3 other picketers.  One of them starts asking her to please not shop there.  He asks, "What did you need to buy?"  "I just need milk!"  "You can go to Trader Joe's, or Sav-On down the street... just please don't shop here."  The guy even offered to buy the milk for her.  Finally, my sister gave up and ended up going home.  The whole conversation got recorded on John's voicemail.  I can't believe she tried to cross the picket line.  Her excuse was, "I just needed milk!"  I support their cause.  I can't believe these corporations want to reduce their healthcare.  Ridiculous.  She also had another WTF comment last night as we were watching "We Built This City: New York" on The Discovery Channel.  They were talking about Central Park and she said, "Is that the park where they rape women?"  It just goes along with the time she watched a Laker Game and said, "I could see the HIV guy" (Magic Johnson).  If you know my sister, you could imagine how weird these comments sound.  WTF?!

      I have come to a fork in the road.  Last week, I learned that I have 120 hours left to work.  For those of you that donít know, I have a casual employment at work; Iím considered full-time, and I get medical benefits, but the position only allows 1000 hours before you have to decide whether to become a career employee or move on.  So, I need to make a decision quick.  Iím leaning towards staying because I havenít found many options here in LA, but I just came across an editorial assistant listingÖ in New York.  Itís for Fodorís, an imprint of Random House, which specializes in traveling guides.  The position sounds perfect for me; itís entry-level, and allows for excellent growth opportunities.  But Iím hesitantÖ Iím not sure if Iíd be ready for a big move, and I donít know if I can leave JerelÖ I mean, I donít feel like heís holding me back at all, on the contrary, heís really encouraging me to go.  I donít know what to doÖ I think Iím going to try and see what happens thoughÖ  I was talking to Nicole about it and she doesnít want me to think back and wish I had tried.  No harm in tryingÖ at least Iíll know what Iím up against.  I know I can kick ass at this job.  Itís all me: detail-oriented, writing/editing background, love to travel, computer experienceÖ this totally fits what I want to do.  For so long I was wondering what I really wanted to do, and I believe I found it, this is it.  I need to prepare my resume.

      The past couple of days, I've been worried that my computer was taken over by a virus or something, but it turned out that my CPU fan conked out.  So whenever the CPU overheated, my computer would restart, or not boot up at all.  Turns out there was dust clogging up everything inside the tower.  But my bro just put a new one in today, and so far, so good.  We'll see.  I guess there's no permanent damage to the CPU (it heated up to 107∫ C!) as far as I can tell, everything seems to be running fine.  But if you ever wondered what burnt dust smells like, think of ironing.  On to some other stuff... thanks to Vanessa, she solved my image posting problem.  So soon, I'll probably have some images to share.  I also added other random stuff.  Speaking of random stuff, check out  urlLink Boing Boing .  They have a  urlLink link  to foldable dolls.  Think Mario Bros.

      Watched  urlLink Elf  last night with Jerel and the cousins.  We went to the Burbank AMC 16.  It was hilarious afterwards; we ended up going out the back, running into these hallways with extremely yellow/orange walls, long stairwells, and a lit up construction cone in the middle of nowhere.  Good times.

      I put my medical benefits to use for the first time today.  I had an 8:30am appointment at Kaiser for my sinus problems (I've been having horrible headaches for the past week).  I was told that I'm heading for a sinus infection, so I have my amoxicillin to combat it when it comes.  I went to work at noon to find Nicole's office cleared out; turns out there was an ant infestation.  But not just any ant infestation- she has a headset that connects to a base unit next to the phone.  She soon discovered that the ants decided that the inside of that base unit was a perfect place to transfer ant eggs.  It was gross, from what I hear.  I just got a huge whiff of bug spray (which made me feel nauseated most of the day, but I got over it eventually).  We then had a department meeting at 5pm, which one of our student workers missed...  Anyway, I'm home now, and my nose and throat are feeling a little itchy.  Oh yeah!  I got my Paul Frank Julius Vitton wallet in this past weekend, and it's too cute!  Now all I need is my I *HEART* NY bag.

      Unless you don't have cable tv, then you probably have been playing Texas hold em' ever since the "World Series of Poker" and the "World Poker Tour" has been showing up on ESPN and the  urlLink Travel Channel .  Jerel and the rest of the guys have been playing for a long time now (Charles ordered a table top and it came on Friday, but nobody was home... he already has the chips and cards, now he's waiting for the button).  Jerel and Charles have tried to teach Joanne and I, or well, Charles already taught Joanne, and I kinda knew some stuff, but was sketchy on the details.  So this past weekend, I finally decided to play.  Friday night turned out to be a bust (long story, but we didn't get to go to Joan's or Francis' outings).  Saturday was a lazy day... Jerel had his ortho appointment in the morning, and then we took a long nap, and then met up again at Charles' to hang out with Joanne and Michelle.  We had our fill of IHOP and homemade sundaes.  Okay, so finally, we were lying around most of the day, either watching tv or playing Speed or Blackjack, when finally we all started playing poker... and I did pretty good!  Joanne, Michelle, and I were cracking up 'cause we kept joking around with our poker faces... and there were a couple of hands where it got all exciting (I actually got 4 of a kind, on the river!).  In the end, we each just bet $1, and it was down to Charles and me.  But Jerel was getting tired and wanted to head back to Irvine, so Charles and I just played the last hand for the winner.  I had a pair of 7s and he had a pair of 8s!  So he got $5.  But I gotta say, I think I'm pretty hooked now.  I can see why they play until 6 in the morning.  I'm so hooked, that I'm watching the World Series of Poker on ESPN2, and it's on until 9pm...

      It's Joan's birthday!  I haven't seen her in a long while, but she's having a thing at Saddleranch at Universal Citiwalk.  Francis is also having something for his birthday, so we're probably gonna do a half and half thing.  I was just thinking about all the people I work with, and you know, I really do like all the people at the bookstore.  Everyone is so nice, and such a character!  Our department has a really good staff, and the rest of the staff is so funny, especially when they all get together (it was one of the manager's birthdays).  I consider myself pretty lucky to know everyone and get along with them, especially my staff =)  Besides, birthdays always mean either lunch or cake for the departments!

      On the way home from work,  urlLink 100.3  was having a tribute to Michael Jackson by playing all his songs.  It was actually nice to listen to the old school Michael.  I don't think he did it, though.  At least, let's hope he didn't.  Just like Kobe didn't do it.

      Today, some of the staff went to Islands for Nicole's birthday (Happy Birthday!).  They were talking about the cases of Hepatitis A that have been linked to green onions.  I ordered the Yaki soft tacos, which has scallions.  I didn't bother to ask for no scallions.  Hopefully nothing happens... I don't think there have been any reported cases on the west coast anyway.  I'm going up to LA later tonight.  I'm just relaxing for now 'cause I'm tired.  I trained a new student worker today.  He's also from San Diego.  He went to Morse.  That makes 3 of us from SD.  Now, our department is almost all Filipino.  Apart from that, most of us our left-handed.  Just some random facts.

      I can't stop shopping.  I just won 2 auctions on Ebay for a Paul Frank Ellie purse, and a Paul Frank Julius Vitton wallet.  Last week, I bought the Lucky Shopping Manual.  The week before, I bought a cord jacket from Gap.  A few days before that, I bought another jacket from Gap.  Before that, I bought more clothes.  Practically everyday, I eat out.  Starting December 1, I'm only getting paid once a month.  Even though I'll get a big chunk of money, I'm gonna have to budget for 1 month instead of 2 weeks!  CRAP!

      I am a shopaholic.  I cannot stop buying stuff.  Everytime I go to Target, I look for DVDs that cost less than $10.  Everytime I go to the mall, I've spent at least $75 (I think I've spent hundreds within the past 2 months, eek).  Now, I'm starting to get addicted to Ebay.  I've never really found anything that I wanted on there, but within the past 4 days, I've already won 2 auctions for Paul Frank stuff.  Oh man.  I'm in trouble.  What will I buy next...

      Well, not much happened this weekend.  Friday night, the coworkers ended up eating at  urlLink Island Grinds , the OG Loft.  Then, Jerel came late Friday night.  We slept in Saturday, "tried" to make it to a showing of  urlLink Master and Commander  at Spectrum (but it was too late), and then went to San Diego to eat out with Audrey, Michelle, and Jason.  We went to Casa de Pico in Old Town, kinda our tradition every once in awhile.  We were supposed to go to Bar Dynamite, but Jerel forgot his wallet in Irvine.  So while everyone else went, we tried to catch a showing of Master and Commander at Fashion, but we were too late.  We ended up driving back up to Irvine that night.  Sunday, slept in again.  Did some laundry, cleaned my room a bit, and read.  Pretty kick back.

      I forgot to post this last week.  Here's the Prizoner of Azkaban  urlLink teaser trailer .  I just watched Chamber of Secrets on HBO earlier today, and after seeing it again, it seems so cheesy.  I mean, I knew it was when I saw it in the theater, but I could really see it this time.  I really hope this film is better.  The trailer looks really good, though.  From the editing and the way the shots were made, it looks promising.  I think Chris Columbus could have made a lot of the shots better in the earlier films.  Or hopefully, the actors will be better directed.  Well, not that I'm an expert or anything.  Maybe I'm just too excited.  I guess I should say that I hope the screenplay is better.  Anyway, like I said before, I'm really excited about this one.  Can't wait for June 4, 2004.

      I can hear the  urlLink Kill Bill: Volume 1 Soundtrack  next door at Clone.  I finished my interview with Nicole and Hiromi, and I guess you can say I'm now a career employee... well, actually December 1, officially.  I'll have full medical benefits- health, dental, and vision.  Then, I can finally go to the dentist, and AFFORD it!  I'm so excited.  Tonight, we were supposed to eat out at King's Hawaiian, but Flori flaked so we're gonna go to the old Loft.  I forgot what it's called.  Then tomorrow, I think I'll head to SD to eat out with Michelle and Audrey in Old Town.

      I am an avid reader of  urlLink Lucky .  After buying so many issues, I finally subscribed, and received my first issue just a few days ago.  I also just bought the  urlLink Lucky Shopping Manual  from  urlLink Buy.com .  I went to Borders last night with Jerel to look at books on bungalows, and when I flipped through the manual, it just made so much sense.  I LOVE it.  I don't think I can live without it.  Anyway, I was looking through the Lucky website and came across  urlLink West Elm .  It's the "cousin" of Williams & Sonoma.  It looks really cute.  Too bad I don't have my own place to decorate.  Well, as for this past weekend, I watched  urlLink The Matrix Revolutions  on Friday night.  Saturday, I went to SD and hung out at PB Bar & Grill.  Then Sunday, I spent the afternoon at Cindy's making party favors for her wedding.  Then in the late afternoon, I went back to Michelle's and helped her with her photo assignment.  Then we watched one of the  urlLink Incubus  DVDs.  I need to buy more band DVDs.

      Okay, okay... So I'm a big Harry Potter nerd and I always look at  urlLink MuggleNet  for the latest Harry Potter news.  They had a post with a link to some  urlLink promotional images  from the upcoming "Prizoner of Azkaban" movie, set to release next June, I believe.  The new director is Alfonso Cuaron, of  Y Tu Mam· Tambien .  I liked the first two movies (although it does no justice to the books), but I've been reading about the next one and it seems like it's going to be a whole lot better.  Just looking at these shots, you can see that Cuaron has a totally different feel and vision.  The top 5 images are captivating; I guess I'm looking at them with a photographic point of view and I'm drawn in by the lighting and composition.  It seems a lot darker and intense.  I can't wait to see it.

      I just got home from dinner with Tin-tin and Jenn.  Oh, I miss working with those girls.  The old Antpub crew!  Not that it's not cool now, but we were a good team, too.  We ate at The Loft in Cerritos.  It was really good, I couldn't decide what to eat so I got a combo plate with Kalua Pork and Fried Chicken.  I didn't finish it, of course, so I got my baon for tomorrow.  We reminisced about things that happened at work, especially the times when we got in trouble with professors.  The most notable time was when a certain professor came by and was not happy that his packet wasn't ready.  Tin-tin wasn't in the office, so Jenn and I were dealing with him.  While Jenn said something, I start giggling (even though he was pissed), and next thing you know, Tin-tin was walking up to the office door... looks through and sees he's there, makes a scared face, and RUNS AWAY.  Thanks, boss!  Leave us to the sharks!  I couldn't help but laugh though.  But I must say, that professor did NOT appreciate my amusement.  Ah, I miss listening to Jenn and her stories.  I started crying in the car, I was laughing so hard.  She is too funny.  Tin-tin picked up this dinner, so we're planning to rotate paying.  Next time, Jenn insists that she take us to this Chinese restaurant.  So, till next time...

       From a bulletin Jerel passed on in Friendster:   The following is the philosophy of Charles Schultz, the creator of the "Peanuts" comic strip.  You don't have to actually answer the questions.  Just read the e-mail straight through, and  you'll get the point.   1. Name the five wealthiest people in the world. 2. Name the last five Heisman trophy winners. 3. Name the last five winners of the Miss America contest. 4. Name ten people who have won the Nobel or Pulitzer Prize. 5. Name the last half dozen Academy Award winner for best actor and actress. 6. Name the last decade's worth of World Series winners.   How did you do?  The point is, none of us remember the headliners of yesterday.  These are no second-rate achievers.  They are the best in their fields.  But the applause dies.  Awards tarnish.  Achievements are forgotten.  Accolades and certificates are buried with their owners.  Here's another quiz. See how you do on this one:   1. List a few teachers who aided your journey through school. 2. Name three friends who have helped you through a difficult time. 3. Name five people who have taught you something worthwhile. 4. Think of a few people who have made you feel appreciated and special. 5. Think of five people you enjoy spending time with. 6. Name half a dozen heroes whose stories have inspired you.   Easier?  The lesson:  The people who make a difference in your life are not the ones with the most credentials, the most money, or the most awards.  They are the ones that care.  Pass this on to those people who have made a difference in your life.  "Don't worry about the world coming to an end today.  It's already tomorrow in Australia." -Charles Schultz

      I am feeling really sad/irritated/??? right now.  My day didn't start off so bad, I went to work and everything was cool.  But near the end of the day, Charleen called me and told me that my auntie Rose passed away.  She died on Christmas night.  She had been having some problems for some time.  I haven't seen her or her family in years, I think since junior high or high school, and that was only once.  We used to all live on Lauriston Drive... it was so long ago.  It's really sad... we should be going to the viewing, but we're not sure when that is yet.  And then, there's my dad... his leg has been hurting for some time, and I was planning to take him to the doctor tomorrow to get a check-up, but it turns out Allan took him to the doctor today because I guess his leg was bleeding!  WTF?  I just talked to Allan and I guess my dad didn't tell anyone that he fell off a ladder.  Now, that just makes me irritated for several reasons.  My dad needs to tell us if something is seriously wrong.  He thinks that since we're all busy we can't take him to the doctor.  But if he needs to go, then we'll go!  I'm just angry... he hasn't had a check-up in so long and we're all to blame.  My dad needs to be taken care of and I feel like it's not happening.  Especially with his diabetes, things like a hurt leg and his feet aren't something to take lightly.  Argh!  I'm really irritated.

      Muahahaha!  What a Jerel.  We watched "The Return of the King" late last night, and it was pretty cool... it didn't seem like 3 1/2 hours, actually.  And I do agree with Vanessa, Legolas does look pretty.  Okay, back to Christmas.  After everyone left, and I had the chance to gather all my gear, I left for San Diego for my snowboarding trip.  I left pretty late, around 11:30 pm, I think.  I stayed over at Michelle's, and then the next morning, around 6 am, Frank picked us up and we were on our way to  urlLink Mountain High .  We got there on time, but were still delayed from a few setbacks.  Frank and I rented our gear (all I needed was a snowboard since I had the boots that Allan gave to Charleen... yet they were so damn tight!  First time breaking them in).  The parking lot was already full, so we had to park along the road.  Then, they announced that in order to park along the road, you need a daily pass.  So, we drove and bought our pass, and then by the time we got back, the road was full and they were saying that tickets were sold out.  I was okay since I had the VIP pass my bro gave me, but Michelle and Frank still needed their lift tickets.  After circling a few times, we found a place to park and headed up to the mountain.  We were trying to figure out how to get tickets (they kept saying to try back around 2 pm), when Michelle saw that they let someone get tickets since they had a voucher (the staff had blocked off the lines to get passes).  So, Frank took my VIP pass to let him through... and it worked!  So, Frank was able to get their lift tickets, and we were on our way.  Now, I expected that it would be tough on me... it's been almost 3 years since I last went boarding and I haven't worked out in a long time.  So, my first run was full of falls, but it was cool.  Michelle and I got to the bottom the the mountain and we waited for Frank (it was his first time).  We waited pretty long!  So, Michelle was able to get in a few runs, and I went on again.  At the top of the mountain, I saw Jason and his friend.  Jason and I went down part of the way, and then he took off as I was trying to practice a move he wanted me to do.  It was still difficult though... it didn't help that the waist on my pants were pretty tight, making it hard for me to get up!!!  But through it all, it was still fun.  After that, Michelle said she was hungry, and so by that time Frank was at the bottom.  We had some cheeseburgers, and Frank went on another run while Michelle and I digested and had some hot chocolate.  Then, we went on another run... which unfortunately had to be my last 'cause my legs were killing me!  Being out of shape sucked.  My legs hurt everytime I tried to break, and I could feel that they weren't gonna be able to support me going down the hill any longer.  So I only got in 3 runs... which, even though it's not very much, I'm not disappointed 'cause that's what I expected since I've been out of practice.  And hey, my ticket was free, so there's no loss.  Oh, I gotta go with Jerel to the lab again, so I gotta continue later.

      Well, Christmas was pretty cool.  Christmas Eve, Jerel and I went to his parents house really late, like around 11 pm.  We had dinner and chilled for a bit.  Interesting conversation.  Then afterwards, we went to the Barrios' house, where everyone just got back from midnight mass.  My favorite quote of the night was by Jerel: "Was it a ham before, or is it just ham?" (???)  Oh, and as we were eating the ham: "You're so good, pig, such a magical animal."  We drove back to Irvine around 3 am or something like that, where Jerel and I exchanged gifts.  Mine was boring and typical: a belt (which he actually got earlier since he needed it) and 2 polo shirts and a long-sleeved shirt (hey, he needs it).  I was really excited about my gift.  Don't think I'm weird, but I love that he got me an air purifier!  HA!!!  Well, if you know how I am, you know that I get allergies, especially in the morning when I wake up.  I'll sneeze and my nose will run for most of the morning, and it's pretty miserable.  Michelle knows what I'm talking about.  So, I mentioned to him before how I wanted the Ionic Breeze, 'cause it takes out most of the dust and mold particles in the air, which contributes to the whole allergy problem.  So, he did his research and got me something like the Ionic Breeze (it's around $300-$400, so he saved money... it's cool).  You don't understand, I love it.  It's what I really need.  It'll give me so much relief.  He was worried though 'cause how does it sound when someone asks me, "So, what did Jerel get you for Christmas?"  "Oh, an air purifier."  WTF?  But hey, I love it.  And it helps me.  He's gonna eventually get me a humidifier as well.  So, the around noon, the family came over.  Christmas lunch was pretty good this year.  Unfortunately, my dad is suffering from a painful leg, so he wasn't able to make his apple pies.  I'm so sad.  (I'm taking him to the doctor this Tuesday).  We exchanged presents and watched "Shaolin Soccer."  I got a cool purse from Allan, a $25 gift certificate to Express and Jasmine lotion from Charleen, the first season of Dawson's Creek from Robert, a Polo shirt from my auntie Nene, a down jacket from my mom (well, Charleen and I got the same jacket; we picked it at the mall and told my mom to just reimburse us hehe), and money from my dad.  I think that's it.  Oh, no that's not it.  I got a $10 gift certificate to Coffee Bean and a mug from Tin-tin,  urlLink New Clues to Harry Potter Book 5: Hints from the Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter  from Jenn (so happy!), a shirt from Hiromi, and socks from Flori and Nicole, which I was totally happy about.  Every time I've participated in a gift exchange, I've always listed socks as a possible gift 'cause hey, you can never have enough cute socks.  And even though Flori got me the "Clueless" DVD for Christmas, she also got me socks!  As well as Nicole, 'cause I told her about how even though I really want socks, I never get it.  So I was really happy to get some cute socks (which I am actually wearing right now).  OKAY!  So that was Christmas.  I'm gonna go watch LOTR: The Return of the King soon with Jerel, Vanessa, Joanne, and Charles at the AMC Burbank 16, so I'll continue with my story later.  Let's just say I'm sore from snowboarding, but not in my legs like I expected.  It's mostly my arms, argh!  Okay, enough, I'll write later!

      I spent the whole night and beginning of the day with Jerel at the lab.  Christmas Eve, at the lab!  Well, I slept most of the time, but still.  So, Jerel didn't get much of his Christmas shopping done after all.  But he's still sleeping right now, anyway, so I don't think he could have done anything even if he really wanted.  I'm finally going snowboarding this Friday!  I'm gonna go with Michelle and Frank.  Only problem is that I'm short on credit at the moment, so I don't think I can rent a board.  Jen, can I borrow yours after all?!  Aah!  I'm scared, I don't want to mess up her $400 board.  Even though I know I'll take good care of it, I'm paranoid.  I knew I should have bid on that board on Ebay last month when I had the chance.

      Awhile back, I said that I'd finally start posting images using Jerel's AOL FTP.  The only thing was when I used it on my computer, it'd always freeze.  But I finally figured it out, so now I can show all the embarrassing stuff.  Only thing is that now that I can post it, I don't really have anything to show.  I don't really want to post old stuff right now.  I'd like to put up recent stuff, but I haven't been taking pictures of anything lately.  Oh well.

         Next month, I'm planning to buy an  urlLink Olympus C-750 Ultra Zoom  digital camera.  That way, I can start shooting again, without worries about buying film... I mean, I'll always use film, but when you don't have time to stop by the photo store, at least you have your digital.  Plus I can upload the images to my computer instead of scanning all my negatives (yet, I still need to do that so I can archive all my work... by the way that reminds me I still need a great scanner).  Then I can post my shit up on  urlLink Photoblogs  for fun.  After buying the Olympus, I'll eventually buy a  urlLink Hasselblad  (hopefully with that student discount... I'm gonna have to work that somehow), and THEN a digital SLR... though right now, I don't know what's good.  Oh well, at least later there will be more options to consider and I can study up on what to buy when I really have the money.  I love photo.  I miss working on it everyday.  By the way, I'm at Jerel's work again, so you can see why I have nothing better to do than post.

      Before I left for L.A., I brought in Saturday's mail and guess what I saw?  A notice for my sister's Bonita Vista High School  10-year high school reunion !  It's on September 11, 2004.  Can you believe it?  That means that ours will be in  3 years .  3 YEARS!  Where did the time go?  And what will I be doing?  Will I be married?  Pregnant?  Ever more fat?  Oh man!

      Once in awhile I'll check to see how people get to my page, and some of them search for the weirdest shit.  Before, there were a lot of people searching for bachelor parties and what happens when you go to one... some others searched if bachelor parties mean that the guy is cheating... the latest person searched for some weird thing at Nordstrom.  Hmm.  Anyway, I think I'm done with my Christmas shopping, at least for my immediate family.  I'm out of money anyway, so I guess I have no choice but to be done.  I'm sending out most of my Christmas cards tomorrow, so hopefully they'll get there in time.

      Tonight is Jerel's company Christmas party.  So I'm getting off work early today so Joanne and I can carpool up to LA.  We're going somewhere in Hollywood, I forgot the place.  It's only drinks and hor'dourves (is that how you spell it?!), but the best thing is it's free drinks from 7-10pm!  Maybe I can try that anti-hangover pill my coworker gave me, hehehe.  I still need to finish shopping.  I still need to get my dad somethin', Jerel's parents, and some coworkers.  But the weird thing is I don't feel in the Christmas mood.  I feel bored while I'm shopping.  That's so strange.  Maybe it's 'cause we didn't get a tree this year.

      Things are getting really busy here at work.  We're preparing for Winter quarter, and it just seems like there's so much to do.  Even though we have the break, it makes it more difficult because people are on vacation, so instructors, publishers, and authors are gone!  We're trying to contact people and follow up on all of our outstanding permissions.  It makes it difficult for us 'cause we're still open, and we still have to get this stuff done...  But besides that, everything is cool.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOANNE!  Big ol' 25!!!  Can you believe it?  We're gonna be in our mid-twenties!  Crazy!  We're going to eat at  urlLink Felix's  tonight, of course.

      For some reason, CJ and his friends are obsessed with "Kickboxer."  Well, it is funny to listen to Van Damme talk, so Ceej's friend Adrian made the  urlLink Kickboxer Soundboard , which is similar to the Arnold Schwarzenegger site.  I forgot the link, I'll have to get it from Jerel later.

      Do you ever feel like the day just sucks for no reason at all?  That's how I feel today.  Well, actually, I do have a reason, but it's private.  Which is why I feel "worried."  But I'm sure it's nothing.  Yeah, that really cleared things up, didn't it?

      I'm coming down with a cold; my throat has been sore since last night (I think I caught it from one of my students).  But it couldn't stop me from going to the  urlLink Paul Frank  Warehouse Sale in Costa Mesa.  I missed the last sale, so I was eager to go.  Thank goodness for the Speedpass, 'cause that line looked like hell.  My pass was from 12-1, and I got in right away.  Pretty crazy, there are some people just loaded down with stuff!  They had pjs, shirts, pants... everything was on sale... including my beloved bike!  I really want the beach cruiser.  It wasn't displayed, but I asked a guy working in the fenced off area how much it was.  $300, marked down from $450 apparently.  Still a lot, but they are too cute.  I ended up getting a zip-up hoodie and a t-shirt for Jerel, and then I got 2 shirts and 5 pairs of socks.  I spent $70, not bad considering how much the stuff usually costs.  The most for one item was $25, and that was for Jerel's hoodie.  That would easily go for at least $40, I think.  I was there for 2 hours.  It was cool.  ***UPDATE: Actually, I just looked at the price tag for the zip-up hoodie, and the retail price is $62!

      I've gotten through about 1/8 of my files.  It's starting to get tiring.  So, for a change of pace, I started going through my school work and such.  Yet, I came across some writing I had started when Jerel and I began to date.  I was inspired by his writing (the poem he wrote when I told him I just wanted to be friends, the scripts), so I decided to write about how my life had changed in that year since I left for Italy.  I read my introduction, and yes, I'll be conceited -- damn, it sounds good.  I haven't read that piece in quite awhile.  I made slight changes and added a paragraph.  I guess it's a work in progress.  Who knows, maybe someday it will become my first published work.

      Last night, I finally got the chance to look at my latest issue of  Lucky , and there are some purses I would like to buy.  Damnit.  I've been quite tired of this skin for awhile, so look out for a new one soon.  I've been working on it for about a month now; I can't decide on the color scheme.  I change it almost every other day.  Then there's the picture problem: I can't seem to upload my pics to Jerel's FTP on AOL.  It always freezes on my computer.  Stupid AOL.  I should just break down and buy my own webspace.  Oh, by the way, this day did not start off well.  Normally, I like to hold my cup while I'm driving 'cause the speed bumps in the parking structure make my coffee splash, which I loathe.  So, I was picking up my Coffee Bean cup while driving to work, and the lid popped off.  So I got way more than a splash; my cup holder was a pool of White Chocolate Dream.  Grrrrrrrreat.

      I was just reading Joanne's blog, and I can't believe I never noticed this: there are no birds chirping in the morning in LA.  Well, that's not entirely true, but compared to San Diego, it's almost non-existent.  In San Diego, it's like, "SHUT UP!!!"

      I have WAY too many clothes.  I have been slowly weeding through my wardrobe, attempting to rid of clothes I still think I could wear from high school.  But who am I kidding?!!  With the help of  The Lucky Shopping Manual , as well as many other websites dedicated to cleaning and organizing the closet, I have made progress.  At the moment, I have 2 very large shopping bags full of clothes to sell/donate, and 1 bag of old shoes.  But what's funnier is that I have a huge box in the garage with clothes I had planned to donate LAST YEAR.  Actually, not even last year, but back in August 2002, when we first moved in here.  Oh man.  Even though I've been planning to clean my room since my last birthday, a huge motivator at the moment is my worries of clothes moths invading my precious jackets and sweaters.  And since I don't have much of a closet, and way too many clothes, it's really time to do something about it.  My desk is also just CLUTTERED with paper.  It's a bug's dream.

      My dad had a 7:30 am doctor appointment, so I spent the night in LB so I wouldn't have to drive early through traffic.  Jerel joined me really late after winning a poker game at work.  My boyfriend loves me: he gave me half his winnings.  Isn't that sweet?  Well, I know what it's for, so you can say it'll end up going back to him anyway, hahahaha!  No, it's not what you think.  Or is it?  Anyway, I took my dad to Dr. Roth, where he hooked him up with a new glucose testing kit, and some more prescriptions.  We then went back to LB, where I tried to catch up on some more sleep.  Jerel left for his ortho appointment (where he was half an hour late... but at least they still took him in), and then my dad and I went to his next appointment at the Wound Care Center in La Palma.  I couldn't find parking!  So I dropped my dad off while I parked far, far away.  After I got in, I helped him fill out some forms, and then they called him in.  They took all kinds of measurements and tried to find a pulse in his feet.  They couldn't find it right away, so they had to do an ultrasound.  Luckily, there was a pulse.  Another man was walking around, and when he peeked in and saw the wound, he exclaimed, "Oh yeah, we can fix that."  The doctor came in a bit later, where he began to  cut  away the top layer of dead skin.  I know it was painful for my dad, but they had to do it.  I felt a tinsy bit queasy, but it was okay.  They also took a culture (when I say culture, they actually took a little piece of my dad's flesh) to examine what kind of bacteria is breeding, and if they need additional antibiotics to kill them.  So the treatment for the week is changing his dressing once a day.  First the wound needs to be rinsed with a saline solution, then this cream needs to be applied directly into the wound.  I forgot what it's called, but apparently it's a cream will eat the dead flesh and bacteria.  But you also have to be careful 'cause it'll also eat good flesh, so the application needs to be right on.  Then some gauze is put on top, and some more dressings are wrapped around to keep it in place.  Pretty simple, but man, that wound looks nasty.  It IS better, at least.  Most of the dried blood came off.  But I can't believe a scrape could get that bad.  Let that be a lesson to diabetics.  Next week, we need to follow up and see how it's progressing.  My dad didn't have much for breakfast, so we had lunch at The Loft, where he had some grilled chicken (I had kahlua pork and island-style fried chicken).  I'm worried though 'cause his glucose level came out to 251 before lunch (it should be at  least  below 140 for diabetics).  So, afterwards, I dropped him off at home, where I went over how to change the dressing.  I can't be there every morning do change it, so hopefully he'll do it correctly.  Then I went to work.  For you curious folks: I don't want to actually take pictures of my dad's wound, that just seems nasty to me.  But I've been reading up on ulcers (which is what he has) and if you want to see an example of what his wound looks like, look  urlLink here , bottom of the page.  His doctor said his wound is in Stage 3, but let me tell you, it looks like Stage 4.  Don't you love doctor visits?

      Muahahaha!!!  More and more, I'm being exposed to the Salviejo/Barrios "family fun time."  I went to Danielle and Vanessa's grandma's 87th birthday party/banquet at the Hilton in Glendale (right?).  Well, it took awhile to get there 'cause good ol' Jerel thought his slacks were in LA, but they were actually in Irvine.  So after unsuccessfully waking him up early, we had to drop his truck off in Arleta, head to Irvine in traffic, back to LA in traffic, pick up Uncle Frank, and head to the hotel.  Of course, Jerel lied all the way there with his excuses of, "I'm finding parking!" while we just left Serrano, and "I forgot to pick up Uncle Frank!"  Anyway, it was a nice shindig.  Lots of singing and picture taking!  The food was pretty good too, although Jerel was disappointed in the "medium well-done" choice.  Afterwards, things really went down when Jerel, Vanessa, Danielle, and I played Scattergories.  I remember playing Junior Scattergories in 1st grade, but playing it again as an adult was pretty damn hilarious.  Oh, the things we try to get away with.  I'm really bad at these types of games, though, 'cause I'm not a quick thinker.  When I'm under pressure, I tend to blank out, which happened a lot.  But I still liked my "eggot" answer.  Oh, and I'd also like to order a "crappy sandwich."  Sunday, Jerel and I went to Freida's birthday farty.  Actually, it wasn't just Freed's birthday, but Ron, Irwin, Jerson, etc. etc. etc.  So there were 6 birthday cakes, I believe.  Tons of food.  Jerel and I had to keep leaving though; the first time was to get some alchy and a new 256 mb memory card (I highly suggest Costco), and then the second time we left was to pick up Jerel's truck in Arleta.  Sadly, Jerel decided not to go to Vegas this weekend 'cause he needs to help his mom out at the house.  Her plan is to throw out stuff that Jerel's dad wouldn't normally let her throw away (Uncle and Jay are going to Hawai'i 'cause Jerel's grandma is sick).  So, Jerel feels that if he went to Vegas, his grandfather will most likely deal him some bad cards as punishment.  So if Jerel doesn't go, I can't go 'cause he's supposed to fund my trip (I don't get paid until the first of February).  Oh well... I guess I'll have to have some crazy fun next time with the girls.  That's all for now.  Even though I didn't have work today, I went in for 4 hours with Nicole to help pay some invoices.  Then early tomorrow morning, I'm taking my dad to the doctor.  Busy busy busy.  ***Oh yeah... I forgot... new season of American Idol!  Woohoo!  More mindless entertainment for me!

      My dad is 78 years young today.  Crazy, huh?  And he's not even a grandpa, yet.  The kids (minus Allan, who had some work to finish) took Dad to Cheesecake Factory at the Spectrum.  We had to stop him from eating too much bread.  When we tried to scold him, he started talking about how he can drink beer.  Ah, he's like a big kid.  When I got home from work today, he asked me where the switch is for the kitchen light.  After I showed him where it was, I asked him what he was looking for, and he said sweets!  What a stinker.  I'm really happy that my dad is finally getting the medical attention he needs.  I took him to his new primary physician yesterday, and he's really nice.  He got to work right away once he saw his leg.  It's still infected; they gave him a few shots of antibiotics and prescribed some stronger pills to combat the infection.  They also took an x-ray of his leg.  The doctor warned though that he's lucky he came in when he did, and that he's able to save his leg this time.  If it was even a bit worse, he would have admitted my dad into the hospital and had him taken to surgery.  The staff is rushing to get him some referrals to a podiatrist and a wound specialist, though.  He said that since my dad's a new patient, it usually takes 3-5 days for authorization, but since he needs to get this taken care of right away, they're doing what they can.  I'm waiting for a phone call.  Today, my sister took him in for some bloodwork and urine samples.  Tomorrow, my dad has to collect his urine all day in this plastic container (which took us forever to try and expand so it was fit for collection).  Interesting stuff.  I gotta tell you, I'm really glad that we're finally looking out for him.  But honestly, I'm a mess.  I don't know where to begin.  It's like a rollercoaster right now.  But I will say this: something really hit me when I was in the exam room with my dad, waiting for the doctor to come in.  As I sat in the chair, looking up at my dad on the exam bed, it made me think of how back in the day, he was the one to take me to the doctor when I was sick.  It's surreal that now I'm older, I'm the one taking  him  to the doctor.

      You know how I  urlLink said  that the way I spend my New Year's is how the rest of the year will be?  Well, based on the full day of sleep I had on New Year's Day, it's been pretty fuckin' true.  Every weekend since then, Jerel and I have slept the day away.  No joke.  I'm beginning to feel really damn pathetic about myself.  Aside from that, I have my camera!  Stay tuned for some pics.

      Wow, I've actually been able to watch tv.  Yesterday, I got my dose of "The O.C." and a rerun of "Smallville" (I should have just watched "Simple Life").  Then I watched "Friends" (such a long hiatus) and then Donald Trump's  urlLink The Apprentice .  I was actually very entertained: 16 candidates (8 women, 8 men) were handpicked by Mr. Trump to go through his "ultimate job interview."  Their first task was the innocent lemonade stand.  At first, I was impressed with the guys 'cause they were able to get free supplies and a display from a vendor while the girls squabbled, but hey, you know how girls work it.  I was thinking, they HAVE to use sex appeal to get back in the game, and they ended up kicking the guys' asses!!!  It was so funny to watch.  Unfortunately, next week's show is during a new episode of "Smallville."  Hmm... have to work this out.  Aside from being a couch potato... my camera should arrive tomorrow!  (In a Monica-like fashion) "SO EXCITED!"

      ...not so good.  Well, it's not too bad of a day, yet.  Jerel and I were forced to take cold showers this morning (I guess John's mom used all the hot water).  I couldn't take it so I just washed my hair, and that was it.  Jerel bared it though, ack.  Now I'm at work, and Nicole isn't here today.  She's up in SF with Eric's family, so I'm the "Big Boss Lady" as Sammy would say.  I'm hoping I don't get bombarded...  I don't think I will, since it's Friday and I'm sure most professors will still want to have a longer vacation, so I'm expecting we'll get the worst of it this coming Monday.  So, be prepared.  Okay, back to work.

      Ah, 2004.  Hopefully this will be a good year.  The last one kinda sucked.  Well, it didn't really suck, it was just that there were a lot of things that went on with a lot of people I know.  But I feel good about this year.  I forgot if I mentioned this before, but based on how I spent my last new years', that was pretty much how the rest of the time went.  3 years ago ( 2001 ), I was at Dean's cousin's with Michelle and Jason.  I got pretty damn drunk, threw up in the garden, and passed out for a bit in the middle of the living room rug.  That year, you can say I partied a lot.   2002 : I went to Vegas with Tals, Lor, and Jerel and his friends.  After the countdown, the first person I kissed was Jerel (as friends).  Then whaddya know, we end up getting together that year.   2003 : Spent a quiet night at Charles' place with Joanne and Jerel.  In short, I spent a pretty turbulent year with the 3 of them, I think.  And Joanne and Charles are expecting.  Who would have thought?!   2004 : Went to downtown LA with Jerel and his friends for Giant's New Year's party at The Bonaventure.  Let's just say I had a pretty good time, you know, rollin' with the homies.  Muahaha.  Jerel and I bonded even more.  I got to hear Paul Oakenfold again (I never thought I would, it's been a long time since Electric Daisy), we stayed up all night, and got home around 7:30 am.  Poor Mike got too drunk and passed out before the new year.  The guys had to stick him back in the car.  We waited in a long ass will call line (note to self: if there is a next time, just get your tickets before, don't bother with buying online when there's will call... it's not like before).  Normally, I don't like cutting because I have too big of a conscience, but I'm glad we did this time 'cause we made it inside right in time for midnight.  Today, Jerel and I just stayed in the whole day at his place.  We just got back to Irvine a little bit ago and had some Thai food.  Pretty good day, I think.  Very good, and I'm pretty happy!  So, best wishes to all, I hope you had a safe and kickass time!

      I just finished reading Jen's post about  urlLink Mardi Gras @ the Gaslamp  in San Diego.  Ah, Mardi Gras.  I remember Tals, Joanne, Lori, and I driving down a late Tuesday night 2 years ago...  2 years ago.  Things were very different then.  Us girls hung out all the time, we were single (except for Tals), and CRAZY.  Damn party girls.  We had fun, didn't we?  Well, I happened to meeting up with a certain someone that night.  Let's see, at that time I was 22 and he was 27.  If the bastard was telling the truth (let's just say it eventually didn't end up working out).  But, nonetheless, that night was pretty fun.  Nothing like taking a quick trip to SD only to go to work and school the next day in Irvine.

      A few weeks ago, I asked Jerel what kind of strange fads they had in junior high.  It turns that even though he was in LA and I was in SD, we still had some of the same ridiculous fads.  Remember these?   Colorful band-aids  -- you know, the ones with Sanrio or Sesame Street characters on 'em.  We sported them on our shoes and folders and all.   Speaking of Sesame Street...  -- remember the shirts?  I had Oscar the Grouch, hahaha!   Sanrio stuff  -- Pochoco was my favorite.  Let's see... Jenn had Spotty Dottie, Joanne of course liked Hello Kitty, then there was Keroppi everywhere.   Bodysuits.   I won't say more.   Scrunchies    Housers/breakdancing  -- well, not exactly that there was anything wrong with it, but we sure dressed the part.  Or at least I know I tried to.  Remember when they banned breakdancing at our school?!   Didn't we wear our backpacks on the front?    Remember our nicknames?!!!   I was Chicklets.  Let's see if I remember correctly... Amy was Smurf?  I forgot.  Joanne=CandyChick, Rachel=Whatchamicallit (sp?)... oh, I don't remember.  Hahahaha!!!  Oh I know there's so much more.  Remind me!  I should post up old pictures.  Oh, blast to the not so distant past.

      Damn, scanning and editing all these positives (yes, positives... Jerel, stop correcting me already) takes for-ev-er.  I only have one 220 roll done.  I have 5 more to do.  That's 120 shots.  At least they look pretty good.  I better get some free clothes!!!  Especially the mohawk jacket.  Yeah.  So, it's raining.  Sammy must be pretty happy right now.  It's nice to fall asleep to the sound of heavy raindrops outside your window.

      I still didn't talk about my Valentine's Day Weekend.  Well, just know it was nice.  Saturday, we didn't actually celebrate anything.  We got our oil changes, and then we watched "50 First Dates" in Burbank.  It was pretty funny, especially Rob Schneider.  I almost cried at the end (damn "Somewhere Over the Rainbow").  Sunday, Jerel and I ate at CafÈ Columbia in Burbank.  Oh.  SO GOOD.       Jerel enjoying his Columbian Coffee    Then, we checked into the Sheraton, and got ready for dinner.  We went to  urlLink Max Restaurant  in Sherman Oaks.  For our appetizer, we had the Ahi Tower and Lumpia (the chef is Filipino).  The Ahi Tower had excellent presentation, but it was okay.  The lumpia was great.       Chillin' before our appetizer arrived         Ahi Tower    Jerel had Wok SautÈed Filet Mignon and I had the Pan Roasted Butterfish.  For dessert, we had items that aren't normally on the menu: I had chocolate pecan pie with chocolate ice cream and Jerel had Creme Brule.  Needless to say, we had an excellent dinner.  For $125.  Monday was our day at Universal Studios.  It was cool being back after so long.    Jerel and I after getting soaked on Jurassic Park                Spiderman attempting to save Jerel from falling         Messin' around    So this weekend was Charles and Joanne's baby shower.  I'm very tired.  I'll put up the baby shower pictures another time.

      Not from working out.  But from a photo shoot I did last night.  From 8pm to 3:30am.  Holding a camera upside down for 5 of those hours can do that to you.  As well as luggin' around what seemed like 100 lbs. of equipment.  Payment?  Hopefully some free clothes =)  I had a fantabulous weekend.  But I'll have to update on that later.  This weekend is Joanne and Charles' baby shower.  You people need to buy gifts already, you laggers.  She's registered at:    urlLink Target     urlLink babystyle     urlLink WalMart    I'll post up their invitation that Charles made later on when I get home.  Very stylish.  I'll also have pics from my weekend with Jerel.  Universal Studios baby.  Muahaha!!!  Plans for tonight: rest these aching muscles and grub at  urlLink Naples Rib Company  for Friends and Family with the Rhino =)

      Well, we finally made our reservations.  Since the Ambrose was all booked in Santa Monica (I was a little sad, but I can't let it get me down), Jerel suggested that we go for the package deal at the Universal Sheraton.  The deal is a suite with 2 adult tickets to Universal Studios, with free admission the next day.  Pretty good, so we're going.  It's still a lot of money, but it should be fun.  Jerel looked over the Ambrose Hotel description, and he suggested we go there when the weather is warmer and for a more special occasion.  I agree.  So, Sunday, I think we're gonna have brunch, go to Universal (we both haven't been there in YEARS, aside from CityWalk), then go to our hotel.  Then we'll spend Monday at Universal again.  Sounds like a plan.  I'm finally getting over my moodiness and getting excited ;)

       Happy Friday the 13th!   Well, Valentine's Day is just around the corner.  Jerel and I aren't celebrating on actual V-Day, instead we're going out on Sunday.  I think I mentioned this before; since Jerel worked a lot of overtime back in December, his co-worker was able to get a bonus for Jerel and another co-worker: $150 to take their girlfriends out to dinner.  How nice!  So, that's what we're doing Sunday.  We're going to this place called Max, somewhere on Ventura Blvd.  He didn't like the actual V-Day menu, which is why we're going the next day.  It'll still be cool.  We still need to book a hotel somewhere, but I guess it'll get done eventually.  Last night we went to see Chris Rock at Universal.  It was HILARIOUS.  At one point I was crying.  Jerel bought a "Chris Rock Crackers" t-shirt, with that logo on the front, and then on the back, it reads, "CRACKER ASS CRACKER".  Classic.  Anyway, I get into work today, and I'm bombarded with sweets.  Cookies, candy, doughnuts, more cookies!  And I'm supposed to be eating healthy?!  If there's one thing about working here, you never go hungry.

      Ack!  I just accidentally erased my post.  Great.  Here I go again.  Nicole took the day off from work, so it was Big Boss Lady for today.  Not much to do since the schedule of classes didn't go online as usual.  After work, I had dinner with Joanne at Rubio's.  That meant that I didn't go to Hip Hop.  But that's okay; I'm gonna try REAL hard to go tomorrow morning.  I wanna go to Kickboxing at 6 am, but that means me waking up half and hour before to drive to campus.  I don't wanna do that, so I'll just take on the treadmill at the 24 Hour near home.  So then... I came home to my boots (and a beanie).  I was excited 'cause I got the fuller calf size.  So, I proceeded to try them on and at first, they didn't fit!  I was BUMMED.  I waited for my sis' to come home from the gym so she could try them on, since she's skinnier and it would give me some hope.  She put them on, but they were too big for her calf at the top.  The trick she used to put them on was to put her leg straight in the air, 'cause they weren't zipping up with her foot on the floor.  So I tried the same thing, and it worked!  I got the sucker on!  Which makes sense, 'cause I took a measurement of my calf to make sure it'd fit according to the chart on the website.  Can you imagine me trying on boots in a department store?  Legs straight up in the air?!  Anyway, I looked in the mirror, and it didn't look right.  My legs have a funny chicken leg shape at the moment, plus I opted for a 1/2 size bigger just in case.  Doesn't look pretty with a pointy toe; me being so short just looks unproportional.  So... I'm returning them.  So sad.  But, so I can keep them in my memory forever as the first pair of knee high boots that ever fit (sorry if it sucks; the blacks on my monitor are too dark so I can't tell if it looks right):     I could wait till next year's J.Crew winter sale.  Maybe then my calves will be skinnier and they'll look a helluva lot better in boots and a skirt.  On a lighter note, here's a watch I just bought on Ebay:     I got it for just $6 (well, $15 with shipping and insurance).  I liked the green.  ENOUGH SHOPPING!!!  (Just waiting for my purse and necklace to come in the mail.)

      My bro just called me and he wants me to start shooting his line.  So, besides all the other stuff I have to do, I need to work out my schedule to shoot next Tuesday night.  Which means, I gotta talk to Rudy about the student schedule, and then go in EARLY Tuesday to sign up for the Hasselblad, lighting kit, and white seamless.  I also gotta get some rolls of slide film.  Crap!  Anyway, wanna see an example of how dusty my room is?     Or, from another angle:     See Evil Debbie in the bottom left-hand corner?  Hehehe... I miss my Mensas.

      I remember back in high school, interviewing for ASB Commissioner of Finance (what was I thinking?  I should have done Art, but I wanted so much to try something else.  Oh well), and the question was, "What is your greatest weakness?"  Of course, being the dumbass that I am, answered honestly, "I have a problem with time management."  In a sense, it's true, but shit, I get my stuff done!  Oh well, I think that was my downfall.  I bring that up 'cause I'm still pondering over all the stuff I need/should to do, and even though there's a lot, I'm sure it'll get done... eventually.   Send out my video and promo materials to Abe at VC   WORK OUT LIKE I'VE NEVER WORKED OUT BEFORE   Make a dentist appointment for my dad and me   Make a vision appointment for my dad and me   Turn in my beneficiary forms for my life insurance and retirement   Finalize my plan for my 403(b) and all that good stuff   CLEAN MY ROOM   Stick to my debt plan/budget (I just had to get those boots... they were marked down to $69.99!)   Sort my clothes/do my dry cleaning   Besides that, there's the stuff I let slip.  For example, last year, Jerel and I bought a Simpsons  urlLink Photomosaic puzzle  after seeing Joanne and Charles' (which they never finished... or actually, went backwards hehe!).  I think we got it back in September?  October?  Anyway, like Joanne and Charles, it was supposed to be Jerel and my "quality time" together project.  We started it at my house on my kitchen table, and since November, IT HAS NOT CHANGED.  We had to put it on some mat board when my family came over for Thanksgiving so that we could put food on the table, and we moved it then and at Christmas, but seriously, it has not changed.  It should look like this by now, I would think:     But it doesn't.     So, with or without Jerel's help, I will try to finish it when I'm not working out.  So sad, I see it everyday on my table and our mail just builds up around it.  Pitiful, considering I love puzzles!  I wanted to finish it so we could get some more, but Jerel doesn't like the others in the series.  I like the other Simpsons puzzle that looks like "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" by Georges Seurat.  It's not a photomosiac, but I think it's cool.  Besides the Simpsons, the Vintage posters, Butterfly, and Eeyore Photomosiacs would be awesome, too.  But where would I display them?  I already have one framed in the closet, the angel that I got from the airport in Rome.  Geez, I remember putting it together; or at least, I remember Lori and Natalia putting it together!  I go away for like, 2 hours to talk on the phone, and I come back and they finish the good part and leave me the WHITE BORDER!  BOO!!!  Haha, I have that picture somewhere.

      1.  When I'm standing in line, people decide to cut through right in front of me (I don't know why this bugs me, but it does).  2.  When 2 lanes are merging into 1 (i.e. Harvard, next to the golf course), and the person in the merging lane decides to speed up last minute to get in front (I don't mind this if there's nobody in front, but when there's a lot of cars merging,  WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO?  ARE YOU MAGICALLY GONNA GET ANYWHERE FASTER ASSHOLE?! ).  3.  When I go into the bathroom everyday in the Student Center and in the SAME stall, SOMEBODY DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FLUSH THEIR CRAP DOWN THE TOILET!!!  ( What's the matter with you?! )

What a great day-- I actually dressed up for work, changed my blog, slapped down $40 + tip for a landing strip, and got 6 seasons of one of my favorite TV shows at my disposal.  What a great day.

      If I start to think of all the stuff I need to do, I get overwhelmed.  This week, I need to send Abe (from Visual Communications) a VHS copy of my "Catharsis" video.  He wants to show it at the upcoming annual VC filmfest this year.  I need to also include my promo materials, which I haven't compiled yet.  Aside from that, I need to clean!  My room is just disastrous, and it's beginning to leak out into the living room, and that's not cool.  Then, I need to really concentrate on working out (I'm starting to keep track of my daily meals again on Let's Go Fatty!).  I think once I begin my daily routine, I'll feel really good and get it all together.  Then there's my recreational time: I think I'm just gonna combine What's Next with Laugh with Me.  I don't think there's a point to keep them separate anymore.  I want to update the look soon.  Then there's all the crap I want to buy.  By the way, I just bought  urlLink Friends: The Complete First Six Seasons  on DVD.  NO MORE DVDs for months.  This really sounds superficial.  But really, there's TONS more to do that I haven't mentioned.  Oh yeah!  And I gotta call Jen back about the photo gig!  Ack!

      If you are looking for a great dentist in Irvine, go to Dr. Lagunda (6648 Irvine Center Dr. Irvine, CA, 92618.  (949) 450-0888).  I went to his office today for a cleaning (I haven't gone in almost *3* years), and it was one of the best experiences ever.  You get to watch DVDs while they work on you.  They put this headset on you and you just watch it while they go away at your teeth.  I watched Friends.  They keep track of what chapter you left off on so that when you come back, you can just continue where you left off, if you wish.  Just overall, it was a great dental experience.  Thanks Eric!

      I don't think you can really tell from the pictures below, but I got my haircut the weekend before (March 13-14).  That Saturday, I spent the day with Michelle, where we chilled and watched some Dave Chappelle.  I got my haircut (a badly needed trim and bangs, finally) at  urlLink Gila Rut  in Hillcrest (fabulous).  I love the complimentary scalp/neck massage, and choice of mini-facial or make-up.  And may I also say, I am now an  urlLink Aveda  fan.  My hair has never been so SHINY.  I will never use Pantene again.  Later, I went with Michelle to her co-worker's retirement party up in PQ.  That Sunday, I went to brunch with Jer Jer at one of my favorite places to eat, the Ramos House Cafe in San Juan Capistrano (no relation).  I love brunch, especially the crab hash.  And the orange juice is just too good.  (Thank you Natalia, we finally used the gift certificate.)  Okay.  So my birthday, I met up really late with some of the girls downtown.  Jerel came pretty late from LA, so we didn't get to SD until 12:30 am.  The girls had moved from Star Bar to Aubergines (funnily enough, that was my first time there).  Of course, I had to catch up, so I set myself straight with 2 shots of Patron, one after the other.  After that I had a 7&7, Kamikazi "shot", and a Long Beach.  All within an hour.  With no dinner.  So I got pretty shitfaced, but hey, it was my birthday.  Didn't make things easy for me the next day, where I wanted to help Jen out for Cindy's bridal shower.  But my headache was huge.  And to think I had the hangover pills and didn't use them.  Silly me.  I felt better after having some sandwiches, and bridal shower came.  It was fun, it was great to talk with everyone, and be photographer.  Later that night, we went to Denny's (HA!  I eventually made it).  Sunday was spent lounging at Jen's, where we had Papa John's and played some Mario Kart.  We then napped, and got ready to go back to Irvine.  Jer Jer and I first stopped at Anthony's to have some fish and chips, and then we left.  When we got back to Irvine, Charleen had made me a cake, which I ate.  I had a bad diet weekend, but oh well.  It was my birthday.  To sum things up, here's what I got Jerel for his upcoming birthday (he already knows what he's getting, so it doesn't matter if I post it.  Besides, he doesn't read this anyway).  I got him tickets to Dave Chappelle in May (did I say that already?) and to give him on his actual birthday, the new Weezer Blue Album deluxe  urlLink CD  and  urlLink DVD  (great deal at Best Buy right now!  I think they sold out at some Best Buys... I think I cleaned out the Lake Forest store.  Good thing I got it in the morning).  What a great girlfriend I am.  Can't wait for Vegas, baby!

      Time for me to get immersed in  urlLink American Idol .  It's all about the black and asian this time around for me.  Just kidding.  I actually like most of them.  I want Camile to make it through, even though her performance wasn't that strong tonight.  She really is like Lauryn Hill.  Jasmine performance was really good, touching.  I don't know who I like most overall, though.  Can't wait for tomorrow.  I'll talk about my weekend another time.  But it was fun and relaxing.  About time I paid a visit to SD.

      Michelle told me that she was going to run a marathon with her sister next month.  Running a marathon has always been a goal of mine, so why not start with the  urlLink NIKE Run Hit Wonder ?  You can either do 5k or 10k.  I'd have to start training like, tomorrow.  Tin Tin told me it took her 7:58 to walk the entire LA Marathon.  Wow.  She has the medal and the sunburned hands to prove it.  On another note, Armand and Pete have been sending me  urlLink Mr. Picassoheads .  I swear Armand's Picassohead looked like a vagina.  I'm going to San Diego tomorrow!  Woohoo time for my annual visit!  I'm supposed to have lunch with Michelle, Aud, and RunRun, get my haircut at Gila Rut, then go with Michelle to her co-worker's retirement party.  Open bar!

      I talked to Jason just awhile ago.  It's weird how we don't talk so often as we used to.  I mean, of course we don't, but it's funny how when we do talk, it's still kinda how it used to be, in terms of how we always have something to talk about... if that makes any sense.  I'm glad we can still talk to each other pretty openly.  I think of my other friends who don't even talk to their ex's anymore, and I'm glad that Jason and I still have a good friendship.

      Ah.  Nothing like finally getting your tax refund after 3 years of stupid Social Security taking it from you (long story), and then "rewarding" yourself for good behavior (hey, I've been working out).  First off, I got my  urlLink wingtips  in black/white, then some black ankle boots (they go with everything), and finally, my  urlLink Motorola V400 .  It was difficult at first.  I love my Paul Frank cover for my Nokia (thanks Eileen), but it was getting all scratched up, and I really wanted Polyphonic ringtones (spoiled).  So yesterday I thought, hey, I'll get me a new phone.  And so I did.  I did have to commit to a 2-year contract (it felt good to be free for the past 2 years, but hey, I've had this number since 1999 with no real complaints, so why not).  It's also difficult to change from Nokia to Motorola.  At first I thought I had made a mistake, but it's growing on me.  I'm getting used to the features and interface, and I have to say, I like it.  I've got my phonebook down and organized the way I want.  I was bugged that multiple numbers showed for 1 person, but I just figured out how to show just one name with the primary number.  Now that I figured that out, I love it.  Now I can also have a  urlLink Moblog .

      One last thing about the 7-11 crime...  So I get home today, and I see that there's a message on our answering machine.  It's a recorded message from the Irvine Police Department saying that they caught the 2 criminals involved in the crime, and that there are no other suspects.  I was like, wow.  They actually call all the people in the neighborhood?  Can you imagine that in LA?

      Reading  urlLink this  makes me so mad.  The suspects beat and killed the man before trying to get the money from the register.   And one of them was hiding in the complexes nearby!!!  Jon Jon lives in those complexes.  What's also a shame is that he was an  urlLink educated man  that just wanted to provide a better life for his family in America.  The workers there are always nice.  I never felt like I was in any danger when we would go on late night runs for Slurpees.  This is just so sad.

      Joanne just called me and told me that the late-night guy who works at the 7-11 near my place was  urlLink killed  last night.  He was apparently stabbed.  The only 7-11 in Irvine!  How sad!  What's going on?  First samurai swords, now this?!

      An article in the  urlLink LA Times  today is stating that the price of milk is going up tomorrow.  Legally, the mininmum price for a gallon of milk will be $2.90.  So if you're running low, I'd go stock up today!  (We actually have 2 gallons of old milk in our fridge.)

      Well, the  urlLink VC Filmfest  is now upon us.  The LA Weekly lists the filmfest as its calendar  urlLink pick of the week  for film.  Pretty exciting, yeah?  Yesterday, I received a call at work from a man named Winston.  He extended a last minute invitation to attend a mixer that night, hosted by the Filipino American Network ( urlLink FAN ) to promote my film.  I guess they had sent a mass email before, but mine got bounced back (apparently they forgot the "t" in my email address).  So, I decided, what the heck, why not?  I called Jerel to see if he wanted to go with me since it was at Hollywood Billiards, just down the street from his work.  At the time, he thought that he didn't have to work late, so he agreed to come.  But of course, by the time I got up to Hollywood, he had to work late.  He still came with me over there, though.  When we first came in, I wasn't sure where to go.  After realizing there was a Filipino at the door with a nametag on, I asked him and he directed us to the room full of Filipinos.  Now, I have to mention that I get nervous when I'm around a lot of Filipinos.  I think it's because I really don't know much about my heritage, and to be in the presence of proud Filipinos who are very committed to the promotion of our culture makes me feel like an outsider.  However, in the end I was glad I went, because everybody made me feel welcome and very comfortable.  I was able to mingle with a lot of people, and they sounded intrigued with my film.  So, we'll see how it goes...  Afterwards, we went back to Jerel's work.  I thought that he'd be done in 2 hours (12:00 am), but guess how long we were there 'till?   4:00 am .  AND I had to drive back to Long Beach at 6:00 am to pick up my dad for his dentist appointment, then go to Irvine for work.  So yes, I am very tired and I was late to work.  Now for today, I'm leaving work early to take my dad to the dentist, then I'm driving up to LA again for Opening Night at the Directors Guild of America.  Hopefully, Jerel will get out of work in time and he could drink to his heart's content.  Poor guy, he's been working OVERTIME (as is a lot of his co-workers).  Ah, we need sleep.

      Muahahaha!  The Run Hit Wonder  urlLink photos  are online.  You can see Jerel and me  urlLink here .  I was pitiful.  Here are the race  urlLink results  for the 10K: I placed 8005/8345 and my net time was 1:40:40.  Oh well, actually I guess it isn't bad for not training and wanting to vomit the whole time.  It was so much fun!  It makes me motivated to do better next year!  Next time, I'll  urlLink pose  like Michelle and her sister!!!

      Today was the Nike Run Hit Wonder for Los Angeles.  As some of you may know, Jerel and I did the 10K.  A little through it, I did think, "What was I thinking?" but only because I didn't feel that great from the beginning.  Jerel and I carbo-loaded the night before, but this morning, I just felt like vomiting.  Not sure why.  We woke up around 6:15 am or so, got ready, and headed towards the Colisseum.  I started feeling sick on the drive over there.  I was debating throwing up before the race, but then decided to just see how it would go  Anyway, we were trying to find Michelle, but we didn't end up meeting up.  I did see Tin-Tin, though.  I knew it was her 'cause she had her big hat, long sleeves, and pants.  Since we were waiting around for Michelle, we started the race late.  Actually, Jerel had to use the porta-pottie again, so that made us a little more late.  But anyway, we got going.  As we approached mile 1, we passed A Flock of Seagulls.  We stopped for about a minute or so, but I actually should have kept going 'cause it ruined my pace and I felt tired.  When we actually got the mile marker, I had to stop and walk for a bit.  Over and over, I would try to start jogging again, but my chest started hurting and I was having that nauseated feeling.  I hated that I felt that way.  Along mile 2, we passed Tommy Tutone playing his one-hit wonder.  UPDATE (06.29.04): I never got to complete this post!  Let's just say right when I crossed the finish line, I threw up.  But I did it!

      As an active user of Blogger, I get to participate in Google's Beta email service,  urlLink GMail .  Cool.  Okay, on to more important things.  Yesterday morning, I took my dad to the wound care center and good news-- he's completely healed!  So no more wound care visits (unless something else happens).  I usually turn my phone off while I'm at the doctor's office, so it's no surprise that I had a message waiting when I left... and it was Joanne telling me that they were going to induce labor!  Poor Joanne had a stressful weekend, which *probably* contributed to Sophie's inactivity and drop in heart rate.  I picked up Jon Jon from school, and we headed over to St. Joseph's.  We got there a little after 2:30 pm, and met up with Charles and Joanne.  They had already started her IV, which was feeding her the hormone to induce the labor (I forgot what it was again).  Poor Joanne hadn't eaten/couldn't eat the whole day, and had to sit through Charles and Jon Jon eating Del Taco.  All she could have was "ice chips."  Shannon came by later, and we were just waiting.  Joanne didn't seem too fazed by the contractions, but when her doctor finally showed up around 4:45 pm, she examined her and found that Sophie had gone poopies (I forgot the technical term, so sorry!), so they had to take some extra precautions.  They had to make sure that once Sophie was out, they would have to immediately suck up all the stuff that may be inside her mouth, and then intubate her and do some more suction to make sure none of it gets into her lungs before she takes her first breath.  So they flushed her out and broke her water.  After that, Joanne started having stronger contractions.  Despite Joanne's fear of needles, she got the epidural after Charles kept saying that it would be better for the baby.  The nurse had also said that if she got it, it would be a much more controlled situation.  So, she got it even though she said that the pain was bearable.  Crazy girl would rather endure the pain than the needle!  I know when I'm in labor, it'll be like, "Do you want the ep..." "YES."  *** UPDATE (06.29.04) I never finished this post.  So much was happening!  Anyway, to conclude this post, we all know Sophie is a healthy and happy baby.  So CUTE.  I videotaped the whole ordeal.  Now I REALLY know Joanne!  Ha!  Now Joanne has a April Fool's baby and a 420 baby.  Funny, huh?

        UPDATE (04.25.04):  I found out on Friday that they didn't go with Jennison (Jenna Jameson?).  It is now Josett.   I just got back from the hospital/Norms!  Well, actually I got back a little before this, but Jerel dropped his bottle of Issey Miyake on the floor and cut his foot.  So we had to clean up the mess and I had to tend to his wound.  Sophie was born on April 20, 2004 at 6:31 pm.  She weighs 6 lbs. 5 oz. and is 19" long.  She has Joanne's eyes and Charles's lips!  She's  sooo  cute!  Sophie is healthy, and mommy, daddy, and daughter are doing very well.  I'll post pictures later, but after Charles sends out his announcements.  Congratulations!!!

      While waiting for  Kill Bill  to begin, there was a  Friends  trailer for the last episodes, and it made me so sad.  And the trailer that they showed after the reruns last Thursday was a tear-jerker, too.  I can't wait to see what happens.  I will feel a big void on Thursday nights.

      ***  Baby update:  Not yet. ***  Alrighty then, here's my weekend update.  Jerel and I kinda got moody with each other late Thursday night while trying to work out the weekend plans.  Turns out I don't need to do a transfer from mini-DV to Beta SP for my film, so I thought I would go to SD for Jason's birthday on Sunday.  I said that I wouldn't be coming up for the weekend, and he said that he had yardwork to do Saturday, and wouldn't be staying in Irvine Sunday night 'cause he had a lot of work to do early Monday morning.  Since I wasn't coming up Friday, I swear Jerel was giving me a guilt trip by saying, "I guess I'm gonna watch  Kill Bill  by myself... I guess we're not going to watch The Offspring."  Problem was, he never mentioned those things while we were discussing our plans for the weekend.  Blah blah blah.  But of course, all that went out the window when Gibbie called me at work Friday.  He had extra Offspring tickets that he couldn't get rid of.  Since we were both in a somewhat better mood, I decided to go up to LA even though I didn't want to drive and I was tired.  So Friday night, Jerel, Gib, Mitsy (sp?), Janelle, Ron, and I went to Universal Amphitheater to watch The Offspring.  We got there during intermission, so that's all we saw.  It was a good concert, even though we were all the way up in the Mezzanine and way to the left.  The stage lights were threatening to give us seizures, but it was still cool.  Afterwards, we had some Leo's, but I was so exhausted that I just slept the whole time we were at the truck.  But I ate some good tacos.  Saturday: woke up late.  Jerel unknowingly missed his orthodontist appointment that he's put off for the last month.  We pretty much bummed it the whole day.  I updated more of Jerel's bank account while he played  True Crime .  Totally did not work on his yard.  We were also looking after Sonny Chiba (Wendell's pit bull puppy), who decided to take a dukes in the middle of the dining room.  We then put him outside, where he had some fun with some old shoes.  Later that night, we headed down to Huntington Beach for Lil' John's birthday.  We picked up The Rhino in LB first, then took PCH to Fred's.  I was designated, but I still had a few drinks (I was okay, but that was a lot of beer).  Lil' John was of course Drunk John.  One of the bartenders was wearing the tank top that Joanne and I had wanted to get, which said, "Kiss My Taco Tuesdays."  I told Chris that I wanted the tank top, while of course he said, "I want what's underneath."  Jerel was supposed to say, "Hey nice tank top, can I get one for my girlfriend?"  But for some reason, he didn't do it.  He says it's because the other girl bartender waited on us, but I think he could've easily called her over.  Oh well.  Afterwards, we tried to make it to Turk's before last call, but we missed it.  So we ate at Harbor House, and I had some good French Toast.  We stayed over at Chris's place.  We parked a block away, in front of Chris's car.  We were next to some Christian church, and Chris said that they always stare at him when he goes through the parking lot, as if they sense a heathen.  We watched  Risky Business  until 5 am.  Around 9:30, I woke up and wished Jason a happy birthday.  Later that morning, Chris discovered that his driver side window had been bashed.  Oddly, they didn't take anything, and he had his guitars and amp in the trunk.  We kept joking that it was the Christians that did it.  For brunch, we went to a place called Nick's in Seal Beach for breakfast burritos.  Those must be the best tasting breakfast burritos I've ever had.  It had chorizo, bacon, egg, cheese, potatoes... mmm... I'm salivating just thinking about it.  We tried to watch Kill Bill, but Chris had work at 2:30 and couldn't make it.  So we ventured over to Tower Records for a bit before heading back.  Jerel and I bummed it even more in Irvine, where of course I didn't go to SD.  Even later that night, we went to the Spectrum to watch  Kill Bill .  We had a late dinner at the Yard House, where we had the house salad (spicy! but good), fried calamari, and the halibut.  Mmm... the halibut... damn, we had some good food this weekend.  So,  Kill Bill ... I liked it a lot.  Jerel liked the first one more.  I don't know which I like better, Vol. 1 or 2.  But damn, Pai Mei is just fricken hilarious.  *Strokes beard*  I can't wait to see Tarantino's version of the 2 together.  So that's pretty much it.  Good food, some drinking, and a movie.

      Congratulations to Cindy and Dmitry, who tied the knot on Saturday at  urlLink Park Manor Suites  in San Diego.  Here goes:  Thursday, I drove down to SD for the rehearsal dinner.  I was making good time until I got to the split.  I was about 20 minutes late, but we went through a couple of runs and we were done by 6:15.  We then had dinner at the Godfather Restaurant on Clairemont Mesa Blvd.  Poor Jen was hungry (she's eating for two!), and the waiter skipped her and Lorna.  I ordered some soupy Linguini Pesto.  It wasn't that great, unfortunately, and I LOVE pesto.  Later that night, I visited CJ since I hadn't seen/talked to him in a long time.  We watched his Jamie Foxx DVD (Africa!), and then I went to my mom's.  Friday, my mom and I actually hung out and powerwalked the golf course.  We then had breakfast at Denny's, where we had a discussion about grandchildren.  It turns out that she and Dad think it's time for some grandkids, but none of us are married!  She thinks Jerel and I are the closest to that happening.  Funny, I'm the youngest.  But it's true I guess, 'cause I don't think Matt is ready.  Afterwards, she bought me some workout clothes.  I was supposed to go with Jen and Tony to their first sonogram appointment, but I was running late.  Later in the afternoon, I met up with the girls and we got our nails done.  Then the night before the wedding, we had dinner at Dave and Busters and played some games.  Cindy told us that her dad seemed heartbroken/annoyed that she didn't want to stay home on the "last night of her virginity."  Too funny.  Anyway, dinner was better that night, I had the chipotle chicken salad, and it was sooo good.  I then spent the night at Jen's.  Saturday... the big day.  I swear, it didn't seem stressful at all.  Cindy was so calm the whole time.  We met up at Nani's to get our hair done.  After several hours, we all went to the hotel to help set up and get ready.  It was so pretty.  Jen and I set up the centerpieces, and then we went to the restaurant in the basement to have some food before the ceremony.  We then got ready...  Jim, the coordinator, took awhile to come and get us at the room.  We had champagne before our trip to the rooftop.  I guess it had been "spitting" outside, according to Jim (it was overcast... not raining, but just  tiny  drops), and everyone was ready to go.  I was holding Cindy's kerchief in case she cried.  Unfortunately, Chris and I had mistakenly switched spots, so we were lined up wrong!  But it was cool, only that I was farther from Cindy when she needed her hankie (she couldn't hold back her tears).  The ceremony was a record 5 minutes long!  We took off in the Escalade limo to take pictures at Seaport Village (where Dmitry proposed).  It was pretty cold!  The ride over there was funny... well, everything is funny when Cindy's dad and brothers are around.  I swear, they had liquor stowed away in like every nook and cranny of the limo.  I felt bad handing the bottle of tequila to Cindy's dad while her mom just stared at me!  But what could I do?!  Luckily, they didn't get DRUNK, so everything was cool.  But it was pretty hilarious.  So we got back, got introduced, and had dinner.  The pasta was good, and I just loved the white chocolate fountain.  I ventured over to the high school table, where we took some pictures (below).  Later were the toasts and speeches, it was just... too cute.  The highlight was when Dmitry sang "Our Love is Here to Stay" to Cindy.  I almost cried... I know Jen and Tony did =)  I want someone to sing to me... hehe.  We danced, and everyone laughed when Jerel was all gettin' down with me on the dancefloor (some funny booty shakin'... I was just laughing).  Overall, it was a great night.  Sorry if this sounds all rushed, but there's just too much to talk about.  Anyway, here's some pictures...  Michelle, Ivy, Joan, and Mariel...     Jerel and me (I'm like, poppin' out)...     High school reunion     Guess who caught the garter...     Can you tell how many glasses of wine/beer he drank?  I wonder how many times Jerel got asked when he's gonna do it.  Not enough.  =)  I'm ready, for the record.  We stayed at Jen and Tony's again Saturday night.  I guess I was pooped 'cause I didn't wake up until 12:30pm.  Jen and Tony had gone to lunch with her mom, so Jerel and I got ready and left.  We had planned to have lunch and watch the Laker game at Seau's, but it was closed, I think.  So we ate at Bennigan's.  One thing though-- who goes to a bar to watch golf?!  So that was my weekend.  Overall, really good.  When is it gonna be me?!!!  Hehe.

      Went to Target today.  I ran into Natalia while I was there, which was the highlight of my trip, since I BROKE ANOTHER NAIL!  Well, I didn't just break it, it RIPPED.  All I was doing was moving my items on the conveyor belt.  Damn.  It kinda hurts.  Anyway, I also went to the mall before that to buy a stick on bra for the wedding.  I had dinner at Corner Bakery in South Coast Plaza, watching the hoopla for Tommy Hilfiger's H fashion show.  Just as I finished, the show started, so I stuck around to see it.  It was okay.  I saw Joey Fatone on the runway.

      Damn Spring Forward.  Messed me up.  Started my day out by driving to work (late as usual).  I was so lost in thought (listening to KROQ and the Kurt Cobain 10-year anniversary) that I almost ran a red light.  I even watched it turn red before me before I thought, "Hey, I need to brake!"  So I braked and skidded a good 8 feet.  Embarrassing.  Work was just busy.  I worked a 10 hour day.  Then I went to the mall, where I was supposed to buy shoes for Cindy's wedding but didn't.  I had some not-so-great Sam Woo bbq express.  Tried on some clothes and got sad.  Looked for a wrist clutch with no luck.  Went to Ralph's, that was okay.  But then I just got home, decided to get the mail, and on my way back in, I broke my nail on the sliding screen door.  FUCK!  5 days before the wedding, and I break my thumbnail.  And they're a good length, too.  Oh well.  Now, time to CONTINUE WORK 'cause my dumbass brought it home.

      Sorry for the week hiatus.  It's been hectic at work, and I'm EXHAUSTED.  To recap on the last week:  Friday:  all hail to the porcelain god  Saturday-Sunday:  Vegas baby!  Happy birthday to Jer Jer!  Monday:  Don't remember.  Wahoo's Fish Taco.  Tuesday:  LA, tend to Jer Jer's pink eye.  Forgot glasses.  Wednesday:  LA again, brought glasses.  Had dinner at Naples.  Today:  Jer Jer got sent home from work for his pink eye.  Had lunch with me and the Rhino instead.  Week of work=WIPED OUT.  Favorite dialogue of the week:  Jerel:  Who says this all the time?  "No joke.  No joke."  Johnny:   I don't know, who?  Jerel:  You don't know either?  Angelo.  What do I say all the time?  Johnny:   I don't know... "I'm drunk."

      I just got home from our Antpub +Inouye family (minus mom) outing at  urlLink Balboa  for Balboa Bars.  It was good, everyone got either rainbow/chocolate sprinkles, while I had peanuts.  And then we had pizza.  I must thank the Inouye's for a very entertaining time.  They are the best family, seriously.  Now, I have to pack for my weekend in Coachella for DAVE CHAPPELLE!!!

      I'm such an idiot.  Of course, I have my calendar to the left.  How long has the Prince date been up?  I have no idea why, but this whole time I thought I was seeing Prince on Thursday, 6/3!!!  With that in mind, I accepted the late invitation to Cher Ann's wedding.  So then, I was just about to put up the date on the calendar, when lo-and-behold, the Prince concert is on the same day!!!  I just checked the tickets and yes... the wedding and the concert are on the same day.  I can't back out on Jerel, so I have to turn down the invitation... there's no way I can make it to both the wedding/reception and then to Staples center in the afternoon.  I AM SOOO SAD.  You have no idea!  I was sooo excited!  It's not everyday you see someone get married... and at the same time, it's not everyday you see Prince in concert.  *TEAR*  I love weddings.  I guess I don't have to get that dress anymore =(  Just shoot me now.

      I'M SHOPPING AGAIN.  If I didn't need to buy a dress for the wedding, I'd be fine.  But nooo... today, I went to Fashion Island, pretty much for the first time (aside from having lunch with my sister there one time for my bday).  Went to Macy's (only for women) and bought a tweed dress, a sweater, and a DKNY halter top.  The dress originally cost $138, but I got it for $30.79.  Sweater $39 > $13.65, and the halter top $59 > $25.07.  And then, I just HAD to go window shopping... got 3 pairs of earrings from Claire's (buy 2 get 1 free) and then a cute top from this place called Parallel... originally $60, but the total came out to $19.40.  I love sales.  But I should be saving for Hawaii.  What the hell, I need clothes for Hawaii, right?!  Did I forget to mention that aside from buying the skirt yesterday, I bought 2 shirts from Express for $10 each?  You know what's the worst?  I don't even know if I'll wear that dress to the wedding.  I just thought it was the cutest thing.  So I just got home, and I checked the mail (which nobody has bothered to get for the entire week, so our mailbox was stuffed) and I got the Victoria's Secret Semi-annual sale catalog.  Damn.  I do need new bras...

      I just looked at the picture from my last post and it's too big.  It's like, open my webpage and BAM!  My mug is all up in your face.  Sorry!  Well, I bought a skirt last night at Nordstrom Rack.  It's a Ralph Lauren silk skirt, originally $114 but I got it for only $23!  I don't know what I'm going to wear with it yet, but I thought it was a deal.  I haven't figured out what to wear to the wedding yet.  I don't have that much time left to figure it out either.  Sometimes shopping could be such a chore.

      Another quote:   Fantasia is the next American Idol.  Diana stands on the side.   Charleen:  Damn... she must feel like SHIT!  Me:   WHAT?!  EWWW!!!  Charleen:  I'd HATE to be second!  Me:   Damn... sore loser!!!  ***  Yay!  So  urlLink Fantasia  made it.  I've been pretty good the last 2 seasons.  I didn't watch the one with Kelly, but last season I liked Clay from the very beginning.  And this season, I liked Fantasia from the beginning.  Even though I wasn't into it as much as last time, can't wait for next season.

      Yesterday, I learned that my car can make it at least 434 miles on a full tank, with a little less than a gallon of gas left.  Good to know.  I'm averaging about 27 mpg.  Happy 21st birthday, Danielle (well, yesterday)!  I found out about the gas thing driving to LA after work yesterday to go out to  urlLink dinner  at El Cholo with the Barrios/Pascual & more family.  Jerel promptly bought her Patron, however I think Jerel ended up more buzzed than Danielle when the night was done.  Michelle called me yesterday at work and extended a last-minute invitation to Cher Ann's wedding next Saturday.  Now I have to buy a new dress, woohoo!  I'm planning to go shopping after work today.  Maybe I'll try to leave early, hehe.

       Me:  You'd think there'd be more than one Michelle the whole day.  Michelle:  Yeah!  It's not like my name is Kimchee!  (I just thought that was hilarious on so many levels.)  ***   I drive around a car stopped in the middle of the street.   Jerel:  Damn women drivers!  Yeah that's right, Debbie, women drivers!  WOMEN DRIVERS!!!  Debbie:  What about me?  What am I?  Jerel:  You're just a driver.  You know how to drive.

      Well, it's approaching the year mark since I first posted my "Things to Do Before I Die"  urlLink list  last July.  What have I/will accomplish soon?     go to Hawaii (just reserved our tickets today!  July, baby!)   run in a short marathon  for a good cause (Run Hit Wonder, April 2004... good cause?  Maybe.)    Nice to know that I could cross off at least 2 things from that list.

      Another weekend of good food.  Jerel and I just went to The Smokehouse in Burbank for a late brunch. Tasty.  But yesterday, his co-worker JV had a Thai bbq at his mom's house... and OMG The Original Thai BBQ will just never match his family's satay.  Mmmm.... my mouth just waters just thinking about it.  We also had Thai Iced Tea flavored ice cream... oh, so good.  SO GOOD!!!  So yeah, I'm gonna have to do some major working out.  Before the bbq, Jerel and I had Tommy's for lunch.  Well, the reason for all this indulgence is 'cause it's Jerel's "last weekend" before he officially changes his lifestyle.  He went to the doctor Friday morning and found that his blood pressure is even higher than last time (though it may be contributed to his work this past week).  As a result of his high blood pressure, he's been taking medication, which has given him this nasty cough (he's coughing as I type).  As another result of his high BP, he has an  urlLink enlarged heart .  They found this in his chest x-ray the first time he went to the doctor's office.  So, Jerel really needs to start watching what he eats, bring his weight down, etc.  So what is it with doctor's making you wait forever for an appointment?  I've been pretty lucky, but Jerel had to wait several hours to be seen, and Joanne waits forever, too.  These doctors need to stop overscheduling or something.  It's ridiculous.  Besides being worried about Jerel, I just read Joanne's blog and she mentioned that Sophie has a heart murmur.  I'm sure everything will be fine, Joanne.

      I got my new glasses yesterday.  I decided to wear them up to Burbank, and after Jerel saw me he kept saying, "It's different!"  I would ask, "Is it a good thing?" and he kept saying, "It's different!"  Usually when somebody keeps saying that, it's just a nice way of saying they don't like it.  What's funny was when Jerel made a comment about my glasses, Charles goes, "So that's what's different!  I thought maybe you got a tan or something."  (Huh?  Hahaha!)  But I think once he got used to it, he thought it was sexy.  So now I'm the sexy librarian/secretary.  I guess you'll just have to see the frames.  I'll post a picture later.  So yeah, yesterday I was supposed to go with Joanne and her cousin to this DJ competition in LA, but Joanne couldn't find her drivers license.  Instead, Jerel and Charles barbecued and we had sausage, chicken, broccoli, and garlic buttered corn.  Mmm.  Nothing like eating bbq after watching an HBO special on teen drunk drivers and the aftermath of their accidents (skull drilling and washing out a hole in the head, anyone?).  Sophie is getting bigger now.  Her arms look like they have more fat on them.  She's sooo cute!  So, I'm tired.  Jerel and I didn't get back to his place until about 1 am.  Then of course I had to drive back to Irvine.  Now I have to drive back to LA.  Death Cab for Cutie tonight, tomorrow is hectic: bbq, grad party, grad party (LA, Anaheim, SD).  We're gonna try to make it.  Crazy.

      Just got back from the dentist.  I know, it's almost 8 o'clock at night.  But it's not just because he was running behind... it was because I was watching  Love Actually  and just could not stop.  They all said I could just stay and watch, so I did... hehe.  It's too cute.  So, I'm done with my fillings... count them,  6  overall.  Well, I got 4 today (in 3 front teeth), and 2 last time.  Now, I need 3 CROWNS!!!  YAY!!!  How's that for fucked up teeth!!!  Oh well.  My kids better take damned good care of their teeth.  Speaking of kids... so, I call Jerel after my appointment.  He tells me that one of his co-workers, Shannon, asked him, "Is your girlfriend pregnant?"  I guess she had a dream that I was, and she hasn't been wrong (twice).  I start laughing... not 'cause it's ridiculous, but  I had a dream LAST NIGHT that I WAS PREGNANT.   WTF?!  Hmm.............................................

      S...L...O...W...  D...A...Y...  There is nothing to do at work.  Nothing.  We sent Eileen and Deo home.  I am trying to clean the computer up but there's nothing more I can clean, I think.  I'm sleepy, so I may as well blog for a bit to keep me awake.  Weekend was cool.  Friday, I met up with Jerel, Charles, Gib, Tuan, and another co-worker (Abe?) at the new Hooters on Hollywood Blvd.  We had some chicken wings and beer.  When Jerel and I got home, we SLEPT like we've never slept before.  Saturday-- we went to Irvine.  We were supposed to go to SD for Chris's graduation dinner/outing, but she left a message on my voicemail saying she wasn't feeling well so we'd probably do something next week.  Only thing is, I don't think I'll be able to make it to SD next week.  Jer Jer and I ended up going to LB with John.  We went to Naples Rib Co. to have dinner and watch the Lakers beat the Spurs.  By the time we were done, I was buzzed and we headed to MahÈ for more drinks.  I don't remember the rest of the night (see   HUH?!   post, below), besides Jerel throwing up later in the parking lot at Naples.  Apparently, he threw up out the window of his truck, and maybe at the gas station, but I wouldn't know because I passed out in the cab of the truck.  Sunday, we took care of errands like laundry and such.  So that was my weekend.  Yesterday was reunion day.  Liann (a past student worker of ours) was visiting from Hawaii and came by to say hello.  Later in the day, Tiffany (another past student worker) bumped into me and said hello (hi Tiff!).  After work, I had my follow up at the eye doctor and they dialated my eyes.  I guess my eyes weren't dialating fast enough, so they put a lot of drops in my eyes.  Which was fine, but it made driving to LA a bit more difficult and I looked like I was on drugs for hours.  So now I'm in Irvine again.  My dentist appointment is at 5 and I'm getting more fillings.  YAY!

      I'm anxiously awaiting the Prisoner of Azkaban release.  In the meantime, J.K. Rowling relaunched her  urlLink website , which includes a whole bunch of Harry Potter easter eggs.  I haven't had much time to look through all the little things, but I did use the phone =)  (UPDATE: I have 2 pages in my scrapbook.)  (UPDATE 2: I now have 4.)

      Ah, the cute  urlLink police .  Now they have a nice ride.  Anyway, I'm in LA right now.  I'm waiting for Jerel to get back from his orthodontist appointment.  I finally emailed Josalyn back after almost 6 months.  Man, I'm so bad at getting back to people now.  What happened to me?  It's like I've learned to hate my phone and be really lazy at email.  Or it's also that I find I don't have time.  I'm supposed to head down to SD to celebrate Chris's graduation from SDSU.  I better call her and find out what's going on.  I think it's Dave and Busters tonight.

      It's pretty late right now... I should be sleeping, but I fell asleep around 7 and woke up about 2 1/2 hours later.  When I woke up I called Jerel real quick to check up on him at work, see if he's hangin' on (all that overtime).  After, I decided to call CJ 'cause I sent him 2 text messages these past 2 days, and he didn't get back to me.  He's usually really good about that kind of stuff, so I called him.  Turns out he never got them, but anyway, we ended up having an almost 4 hour long conversation.  It was nice to just talk about whatever, like the old days.  We even looked at our high school yearbooks and read what each other wrote in our Sophomore year.  Too funny.  I felt so stupid, you know, high school talk, like "Trick!"  Anyway, it's just weird, to think back on how things used to be, and where we've ended up now.  There are the friends that I've kept in touch with.  I'm pretty lucky to have the friends that I have.  I know that I'm not around as much anymore, but it makes it a lot more meaningful when we all get together.  Like this past weekend, when I kicked it with Michelle, Jaynee, Aud, and Jason-- it was really cool.  I really miss that.  And then I had a late lunch with CJ-- that was cool, it was like we actually got to hang out for once in like, how many years?  Besides all that, all this talk with Ceej, my sister, others... it just gets me thinking about our relationships, who we trust, who we've depended on... all that stuff.  I can't go into much detail 'cause there's just too much drama goin' on around me, but one thing I have to say is that I'm grateful for my relationship with Jerel.  I'm glad that we're able to talk things out, understand each other, and just trust one another, without trippin' out about things.  Well, I know my rambling just sounds all weird and all, especially for people that don't know what's going on, but honestly, just be glad for what you have.  Ah, I'm just being corny now.

      I remember a long time ago, Jason had said that he would be happy with me not cooking as long as I knew how to make dips.  Well, even though we're not together anymore, I'm still set on knowing how to make dip.  So far, I guess I'm pretty good at making Spinach & Artichoke dip.  Next up: guacamole.  With Cinco de Mayo just last week, I've had my fill of it.  I just had a cupful today.  And even though I may be a bit allergic to avocados (my lips get itchy), I'm still gonna eat it.  Thanks to Dorel, he hooked me up with all this food.  Hehe.

      It felt so good to ask myself if there was anything planned for the weekend, in which there was a resounding "NO."  So, I finally went to San Diego for no reason what-so-ever, well, except to hang out.  Friday, got my nails done and watched the  Friends  finale (*tear*).  Saturday morning, I went to Turbo Kickbox, then got ready to head for SD.  I had lunch with Ceej at Islands, where we caught up, and then went to Best Buy really quick to just browse.  He sneakily bought me "Coming to America" despite my protests, but then I just said that it would be for the birthday present he never got me years ago.  Afterwards, we split up and I headed to my mom's and then to Michelle's.  I was actually able to hang out with Michelle, Jaynee, Aud, and Jason.  We had Sangria, cookies, and my spinach & artichoke dip.  It was just too cool to finally hang out with my friends after so long.  Saturday, we met up at the Cafe de Cafe before we all had to part our ways (or at least, before Aud and I had to leave to go home).  Or at least, I had dinner with my mom, Robert, and Auntie Gloria at Red Lobster for Mother's Day.  After that, I went home.  I called Jerel, and after very little persuasion, I went up to LA to visit.  I know, we had previously agreed not to see each other for the weekend (we've been attached at the hip for the past weeks/months/year), but you know how it goes.  No spine.  Drove back to Irvine this morning, which was kinda hellish.  Slow go 5S 'cause everyone was rubberneckin' the overturned big rig on the 5N.  Poor, poor people stuck in that mess.  Alas, I'm here at work (Nicole is at at a dentist appointment, so I'm here by my lonesome right now) and I'm sleepy.  Back to work.

      One of my student workers has a secret admirer... or not so secret, since he came in the office to give her a yellow rose.  I wasn't there when it happened, so I don't know what he looks like.  Too funny!  I went to the Johnnie Walker tasting last night.  Interesting.  Liked the "Rich Fruit" but "Smoke"... not so much.  Afterwards, Jerel and I went to Chan Dara in Hollywood.  It was so good, but I got full pretty quick.  So Jerel had most of the deep-fried catfish =(  I'm actually going to San Diego this weekend, so watch out.  Too much to catch up on, I'll write it all some other time.  I'm lazy.  As Michelle would say, smell ya later!

      Ah, it's been busy busy busy.  I feel like I haven't been home in 2 weeks.  I've been driving to LA almost everyday for different reasons.  I think I've put on +300 miles in the last 2 weeks.  I had my screening last night, and it was pretty cool.  Not many people I know came out to see it, which is both a relief and a bummer; bummer 'cause it'd be nice to have my friends who haven't seen it yet come out of the shadows, and a relief that they don't have to see me on stage answering questions.  But I know people live far or have scheduling conflicts.  I think Ryan put it best: "i would go,  BUT you picked a horrible day cause of the Laker game."  I'll have to elaborate later 'cause I'm working, and there's tons to catch up on.  Last Thursday, Jerel got drunk at the Opening Gala on Vodka and tons of sugar.  I have some pictures from last Friday that are pretty hilarious (I think). Saturday, Jerel and I watched a porn documentary, or something like it.  Then we explored the jungle known as Jerel's backyard.  Ah, so much more.  Today is the scotch tasting, so one more trip to LA for the week.  I think I'm gonna take a break and actually drive to San Diego this weekend.  Can you believe it?  Next week, I am staying HOME.

      Let me tell you about a dream I had this morning.  Well, I happen to have a doctor's appointment next Wednesday for a general check-up/physical.  In my dream, I went to my appointment and wanted a pregnancy test.  So, the doctor actually did an ultrasound and found nothing.  When she walked out of the room, I started crying 'cause I was so sad I didn't have a baby.  WTF?!!  I woke up so sad.  I guess I really want a baby, huh?!!  Crazy.

      I stopped using my old email address awhile back 'cause I got so much junk mail, but sometimes I'll check it to see if there's anything important.  I was surprised to find some email from a guy named "Andrew" who saw my profile on American Singles.  And to my horror, I somehow have a profile on there!  There's nothing really on there that says anything about me, but it makes me wonder how that happened?  Apparently, I signed up on 8/6/2003 (which is also the last time I "signed on").  This guy has a picture on another singles site, which I looked at.  He's actually cute if that's really the guy (but looks strangely familiar, kinda like Charleen's boyfriend).  Are you guys joking with me?  Hahaha.

      Like I said before, working at graduation made me start thinking about going back to school.  Well, I don't know if I would go for grad school, but I would definitely take classes on the side.  I still want to take Italian courses... I don't want that to waste away.  Some photo courses would be fun also, just to give me structure and keep me shooting.  Painting would just be extra.  But I definitely want to take some creative writing courses.  And more language courses, like Japanese or German.  All this at a community college nearby.  Maybe starting Fall?  I was thinking... with all the units I graduated with, I seriously could have completed more programs.  A few more classes, and I could have had a minor in Biological Sciences (bastards decided to add a minor my last year at school) and a minor in Italian Studies.  Oh, and a B.A. in Humanities and Arts (basically what I did to get my B.A. in Studio Art and English).  Would I be able to go back to school just to get those minors?  Is that possible?

      I didn't know how many people really wanted it.  I've had my account for 2 months now, but then Joanne called me the other day asking me about it, 'cause Jon Jon really wants one.  Turns out people are selling it on  urlLink eBay .  Crazy.  Are your friends whining 'cause they don't have it?  I think you can invite people now... my "Invite" link is working now and I have 2 invitations I can send (actually, I think they were always working, but I for some reason I wasn't able to click on certain links at work.  But, it works at home!).  Unfortunately, they're already taken.  But, maybe for a lot of money... just kidding.  Just thought you should know, so check your invite links!  UPDATE: Duh, not everyone has the link.  I set up a new account 'cause my dumbass used my old dj1457 moniker.  I thought maybe I could change it later, but I can't.  I've had that invite link for like, 2 weeks or something now!  What an ass.  Anyway, I'll be sending you guys an email with my new address.  I don't want to post it here 'cause you never know if something will harvest it and I'll get junk (I already have some in my junk email folder for my 1st account!).

      Okay, I really have to sleep now, but before I go, I have to mention that I've created yet another blog.  I know, I barely can update my other two, but this one is fun (for me at least).  I'll let you know once I clean it up a little bit.  By the way, too bad us girls didn't get a move on the other idea for a blog: getting hit on.  Well, maybe we can still do that.  It'll be too funny.

      Jerel and I have decided that Thai is our favorite cuisine.  So I was cool with Charleen's suggestion to eat at Banana Bay in Rowland Heights for Father's Day.  We all met up at the restaurant, which turned out to be pretty cool.  The interior is nice, and there was a live jazz band (Odyssey) playing cover songs.  I think we were the only ones to request a song (which they were happy about).  I suggested Stevie Wonder's "Overjoyed" and had Charleen go and request it.  The lead singer really put his all into that song, it was nice =)   urlLink    Allan, Matt, and Charleen    urlLink    Charleen, Robert, and Dad    urlLink    All of us (minus Jerel)    urlLink    Jerel and me  Posted by  urlLink Hello    Other happenings:   I bought 2 new pairs of shoes this past week.  urlLink    Yay!

Get this- she just got her car back from the shop last week from the last accident where she was rear ended.  Before we went out for Father's Day, she was out in front of the garage washing her car.  She was pretty much done, when our neighbor backed out of her garage too fast (I guess she didn't see my sister and her car) and hit her rear driver's side door.  My sister has either a bad luck car, bad karma, or a little bit of both =\ (I do have pictures, but I won't post it)

      I had work off yesterday so Jerel and I could celebrate our 2 year anniversary.  So...   Tuesday night:    Drove up to LA  Watched the Lakers get their asses kicked (I could just sense the joy of Joanne, Deo, and Sammy).  I caught Jerel off guard (I don't know how, he knew I was on my way).  He had been saving a card he came across way back from John and Freida's wedding.  I saw the card before he had written in it and ruined his plan.  So I guess he's going to use it another time.  (sorry!)  We finally had the deep fried catfish at Chan Darae.  We also had coconut rice (I think it's my absolute favorite type of rice), seafood eggplant, and wine.    Wednesday:    Our plans were to go to the Getty and have a picnic lunch.  But of course, we slept in, so we had to change our plans.  Got ready to go out.  Had lunch at Noshi Sushi (I wish I could just take that tub of spicy tuna).  Jerel got his haircut.  By this time, we were running late so there was no way we could have a late picnic or go to the Getty.  So instead, we went shopping =)   I bought new jeans, shorts, and a belt for Jerel  Jerel bought a new grooming set from Brookstone  I bought new shoes from Aldo (I had seen them in Jane magazine and thought they were too cute... and they were on sale for $29.99!!!  AND the salesperson was super-accommodating... I kept asking for different pairs 'cause I wanted the most perfect out of the bunch.  She even cleaned them and sprayed leather protectant).  Jerel bought me new lingerie from the  urlLink Victoria's Secret  semi-annual sale.  Got a mixture of cute and practical stuff.    UPDATE:   Oh, I forgot to mention... my fat ass has gone from a C to a D.  That's right,  D .  While some may consider that to be a blessing, I think of it as bleh.   Had dinner at Max's.  Had some Crispy Tentacles, Crispy Pata, and some vegetable dish (I forgot the name).  Headed home.   Overall, I chill way to spend our anniversary.  We still managed to spend a lot of money despite trying to save for Hawaii.  Well, I have one more paycheck!  I have the best boyfriend.  (Do I sound gay, Joanne and Michelle?  Hahahaha!!!  Sorry Joanne!)

Okay, I do have to say, I was never THIS bad before I got with Jerel!   PROGRESS UPDATE:   Sunday night:  Went through my little closet.  Not the one in the picture.  Weeded out old skirts, dresses, sweaters, and jackets.  Also went through my little linen closet in the hallway and weeded out a few more shirts.   Monday night:  Shredded a whole bunch of old bills.   Overall:  Not a dent.

      You know the one about having a cluttered room/space/etc. means having a cluttered mind?  I so feel like that right now.  It's like I can't hold a thought or concentrate on anything.  My room reflects that.  It's reflected it for a long time, and I'm sick of it.  I'd really like to  urlLink tackle  it this weekend, since Jerel's going to a bachelor party and all, but that's on Sunday.  And JV is having another bbq at his mom's house on Saturday, which means more homemade Thai food (I'm salivating).  Plus, Jerel needs clean clothes, and his dirty duds are at my house.  So I guess I have to drive to LA and bring his dirty laundry (even though I don't want to drive, and he doesn't want to drive to Irvine... so unfair).  Saturday I get to do nothing while he has to work AGAIN, and then there's the bbq.  Sunday, I'm outta there.  I am going to clean that room no matter what.  I need to remember to take before and after pictures.

      That was some game.  Even though Jerel and I got into a little tiff before the game, we still had a crazy time at Staples Center.  Kobe totally  urlLink saved  the game with that 3-pointer, taking it into overtime.  That was a great first experience for us.  Afterwards, we bought jerseys.  Jerel bought O'Neal and I got Bryant.  We also ran into Tin-Tin and Geoff (I think he spells his name like that).  Overall, it was worth the amount of money spent (which was A LOT).

      Summary of my weekend:   Friday   see below   Saturday   Jerel's aunt gets mad at everyone 'cause nobody can take her to Vista to see a healer ("You just don't want to go with us!")

Sunday   Go to SD  Go to Aud's; Cher Ann and her new husband unwrap their wedding gifts  Jerel, Michelle, and I go to Hooter's in Mission Valley to watch Game 1 of Lakers v. Pistons.  Have more REALLY SPICY chicken wings and 2 pitchers of beer.  After the game, we go to TGIF to have dessert... or I have the brownie obsession, Jerel and Michelle split a Jack Daniel's burger.  back to Irvine   Monday   Bring my dad to get a physical; get very upset with him 'cause he's not taking his meds  Go to LA to be consoled by Jerel; we go to Chan Dara for fried catfish, but Jerel ordered the wrong thing.  So we have to make up for it on Friday.  Jerel won a bid on Ebay for tonight's Laker game.  So... I'm leaving work early to go to the Staples Center and watch the Laker game!!!  Probably my first and only game.  Jerel spent A LOT of money on these.  Ah, gotta go.

      After having chicken wings and beer for dinner at Hooters last night, Jerel and I walked across the street to Mann Chinese Theatre to watch   urlLink Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban  .  The verdict?   WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.   Overall, I can say it was good.  I wasn't particularly wowed by it (maybe because I already read too many reviews, knew what to expect-- all that).  It's a good thing I didn't reread the book beforehand, 'cause I probably would have found myself comparing the differences.  Although there were a lot (which I already knew about), I don't think they bothered me.  Well, the ending did a little bit-- I think it would have been better to keep that part of the story the same.  Harry should get the signed permission form from Sirius, and then have to go back to the Dursleys feeling all crappy 'cause he was so close to not having to live with them anymore.  That flying off on the broom with the freezeframe, I dunno 'bout that...  I was hoping they'd change that.  But oh well.  After Jerel and I discussed it, we did have a few differences.  He didn't like the acting.  He thought they overacted.  I was like, "Uh, do you remember the first two?"  I think they've evolved as actors and had a much better performance than before.  Although not perfect, it was a lot better.  But then again, he hasn't seen the first two in awhile, so maybe after he watches it again, he'll have a different idea.  The following two things he mentioned, I'll have to agree with.     Draco was a sissy boy.   That's not cool.  Although he could make himself off to be the victim, he has more balls than that.  In the first two films, he was a lot more menacing.  This one, he kinda was, but when it came down to it, he cowered like a "bitch" (so Jerel says).  I don't imagine him to be like that in the books.   Ron was more of a secondary character.   Although he had a good performance and was funny as usual, I would have liked to see him have more lines.  It just didn't seem like he had as strong a presence as Hermione.  It would have been cool to have the scene where he gets attacked by Sirius in his sleep.   The film quality was beautiful.  I loved the colors and the grain.  The cinematography was awesome; those wide shots were nice.  I didn't mind the changes to Hogwarts.  The portraits were cool, too.  It was funny seeing Sir Cadogan in the background, but it would have been even funnier to see him as the replacement for the Fat Lady during the time she's supposed to be repaired.  The movie seemed rushed.  It would have been nice if it was longer.  I wouldn't mind to see more of the Shrieking Shack scene.  Although, the time turner scene and the action overall in the end was pretty cool.  As for the parts that were left out (i.e. Harry being told who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are; many more), I can just hope that Steve Kloves has a motive for that other than they were just trying to make the movie shorter.  I'm sure it'll play into the rest of the movies (hopefully?).  I wonder what the clues are that J.K. Rowling saw that gave her "goosebumps."  I'm sure that scene with Harry and Lupin on the bridge where Lupin talks about Lily has to be a big part in books 6/7.  Even though that wasn't in book 3, the way Lupin talked about Lily was kinda... fishy?  Well, I guess all I can hope for is the deleted scenes on the DVD.  And hopefully there will be a director's commentary to explain why he wanted to use those transitions from scene to scene (you know what I'm talking about if you've seen it).  Hmm... I want to see it again just to see if there's anything I missed.  p.s. - I'll post a picture of the huge film mural next to the theatre later on.  p.p.s.  - Ron and Hermione are too cute together... hahahaha!

      Had a pretty chill weekend.   Friday  Balboa Bars   Saturday  Had CafÈ Columbia at Charles's place, stared at Sophie Drove to Coachella to watch Dave Chappelle (worth the trip!!!)  Dave Chappelle:  That Rick James's shit is ruining my life!!!    Sunday  Had brunch at Casino Morongo Shopped at Cabazon, bought:  pasta maker (now I can make ravioli with the recipe I got from Italy)  Ralph Lauren sheets  clothes from J.Crew Drove back to LA, bbq at Abe's   Monday  Slept Bbq at Johnny/Freida's Stared at Sophie   Tuesday  Drove back to Irvine I'm the boss today at work (Nicole has the day off)  I just read Jen's temporary blog, and I'm so sad that their selling their house.  But everything is working out for the best, and that just means that I have a good reason to go to Taiwan to visit them and the baby!!!  Then when they come back, they'll be LA residents.  Wow, so many changes in so many lives.  We're growing up...

      I've been busy trying to clean my room when I'm not tired.  So far, I've made real progress on my bookshelf.  Only problem is whatever didn't belong on my bookshelf, is now on the floor.  But I've also improved on that, too.  I'll take pictures later.  This weekend I'm going to SD!  Time has passed by so fast, and Aud is leaving for NY next week.  So, there's a going-away bbq for her tomorrow.  I think it's also a combo going-away for James (going back to Iraq) and a celebration for Jason being in town from Boston.  Then Sunday is the Padres/Dodger game!  We'll see who wins...  Other upcoming events: VEGAS!!!  Just a couple more weekends... and then at the end of September, Jerel and I are going up to Santa Barbara to watch Air.  Oh!  I almost forgot to mention- I'm helping with an ad for Apex, so you will be seeing one of my photos in Metro.pop soon...

      What a nice surprise to come home to from vacation. I just found out that someone has been opening accounts in my name. BASTARDS!!! And for those who know my habits, I am VERY careful with all my accounts. I shred everything. I have a feeling that someone may have gone through our mailbox (it isn't a lock box). Ugh... I think I'm going to get a P.O. Box. Just goes to show you can never be too careful. The most frustrating thing is that I  just  checked my credit report, and everything was fine. And now this happens. So guys, let this be a lesson - keep good records and check those reports... it's really worth it.

      This time tomorrow, I will be boarding my flight to Hawaii!  Yay!  A well-deserved vacation for Jerel and me.  Oh, and HAPPY BIRTHDAY CINDY!!!  *sidenote: I have decided to put aside the convenience of using dj1457, and am now changing my sn's, out of respect for Jerel.  So, my new sn will be deb1edeb.  Not that I'm on AIM all that often, but I just configured my phone for IM forwarding.  Oh, I hope you guys haven't sent me text messages in the last month or so, 'cause I haven't been receiving them.  But it's fixed now.  Okay, good-bye!  Farewell!*

      It's crazy what eating a bad piece of food can do to you.  I think I had a bad piece of fish on Thursday night.  Friday, I had to leave work early 'cause I didn't feel so hot.  When I got home, I SLEPT.  Slept from 11am-5pm.  Joanne had told me she was going back to Burbank, so I hitched a ride with her.  Jerel came by and we all had dinner together... or actually, they all had dinner-- I just could not eat.  We ended up sleeping over at their place 'cause we were so beat.  Saturday was Jerel's mom's birthday, so we went to his aunt's to have lunch.  Then, we got some pants hemmed and then went to Jerel's work.  Slept some more.  A LOT more.  He had to work late so he wouldn't have to come in for the 4th.  So yesterday, our plans were to go to SD for the San Diego Fair.  However, I still wasn't feeling well, and on top of it all, I had a headache.  So my nice boyfriend stayed with me the whole time and forced me to eat.  I swear, I did not want to eat anything, but I knew I had to.  I just wanted to sleep.  I was really bummed though that we didn't go to the fair.  I guess we'll have to wait for next year, again.  Today, I'm feeling better, but I still have a headache.  I was able to step out of the house on my own and go to the spa to get ready for Hawaii (ahem).  But I did sleep before going to my appointment.  It's a good thing I'm getting whatever's in my system out before Hawaii.  Is it hot in here?

      Okay!  So here's what's been happening:   Not this weekend, but the one before, Jerel, his mom, and I flew up to Palo Alto to visit Auntie Connie and Uncle Chris in the hospital (we stayed at their place in Hawaii).   But before leaving for Palo Alto, I had dinner at Lori's new place with Michelle, Ives, and Leah before they left for Vegas.  Later that night, I met up with Chris, Freeds, Johnny, and Marsh in Seal Beach for The Rhino and Johnny's birthdays.  urlLink    The Rhino unleashed.   urlLink    Johnny is drunk.   urlLink    Yeow!  Me, Marsh, and Freeds   urlLink    ?!?   urlLink    Drink up!   urlLink    The Rhino is down.  Posted by  urlLink Hello     I went without Jerel!  He had to work LATE (which I was upset about 'cause he was supposed to pick me up in Irvine!).  I then had to drive to LA pretty late.  Bummer.  But everything worked out okay.    I found out that while I was in Hawaii, my sister had her car blessed by 2 old Persian ladies (a hilarious story I'll have to describe later).  So maybe she won't get rid of her car after all.   This past weekend was Aud's farewell bbq in La Jolla, the baseball game, and Pete had a bbq and a resurrection of the bonfire pit as well.  Pictures below:    SATURDAY    La Jolla   It was a very nice day out.  Jerel and I left Irvine around 1 pm, but didn't get to La Jolla until a little past  3 pm .  WTF?!  Had some hot links.  Like the good ol' days.  Watched some of them play Kings.  I had Jerel play in my place 'cause I make a fool out of myself when I play games like that (domestic beers!!!  uh... Heineken?).  Hilarious watching everyone dance and look cool before taking their drinks.   urlLink    Michelle, Chris, and I   urlLink    Deb Deb and Jer Jer   urlLink    Jerel following one of the rules in Kings (pump it!)   urlLink    Michelle looking cool   urlLink    *heavenly* aaaaaahhhhhh!!!!     PB  (Jayson, Dionne, and Mike's place)  Instead of drinking downtown, we headed over to PB to hang out at the guys' place.  More food.  More Kings.   urlLink    Audrey "watching" porn during a game of Kings   urlLink    Look!  It's Abiva!   urlLink    Hey, fuck you!  (just kidding!)   urlLink    Michelle, Aud, and I    SUNDAY    Petco Park   The long-awaited Padres/Dodgers game.  Jerel and I were late (of course) and didn't arrive until the 5th inning.  Padres was winning, and then it tied up.  I think I spent around $30 on food.  It was funny/sad to watch the fans heckle Werth.  Then we all know what happened in the 12th (12th... right?).   urlLink    The Padres winning   urlLink    Petco Park from our seats (which were pretty good)   urlLink    Padres fans heckling Werth   urlLink    Sad after the Padres' loss   urlLink    Jerel happy at the Dodgers' win    Pete's   Michelle and I couldn't believe that we were still underage when the bonfire pit was shut down by the fire department.  It doesn't seem that far ago... but when you think about it, I was still with Jason, Michelle was still with Dean, and Mike was still with Celeste.  Wow.  We reminisced about the old "Pentagon" pit, and the day the fire department came to shut the pit down ('cause it was stacked 3 crates up, fire ablaze during fire season).  We couldn't remember hiding our drinks, nor watching Pete be the only one to haul buckets of water up and down his steep stairs to the pit up way above in his backyard.  All I could remember was how high the embers were flying.  (Muahahaha!!!  "Ahh... the embers...")   urlLink    The bonfire pit is resurrected after 5 YEARS?!!  (Has it really been that long?)   urlLink    Toasty.   urlLink    Jerel, me, and Michelle   urlLink    Brian, Pocholo holding the spirit stick   urlLink    Jason doing god knows what (I guess he does that normally), and Charles   urlLink    Armand, Kate, and Elvin   urlLink    Pete, our host, with his old Ben & Jerry's co-workers   urlLink    Jerel     Pictures posted by  urlLink Hello    It felt good to hang out with the guys again.  There's nothing better than getting a good laugh from their situational humor ("What would you do if so-in-so was bit by a snake...").  It was also nice to relive the bonfire days.  I haven't laughed so hard in awhile.  I think it cured my growing impatience with Jerel.  So now... what will be happening in the near future?   VEGAS.

It was hot and humid, but actually very bearable.  But the mosquitoes made me MISERABLE for a considerable amount of time.  I had better bring a mosquito net if we stay with relatives again.  We didn't get to see Pearl Harbor.  But Jerel actually wants to go back to Hawaii for Christmas, so maybe then (even though I am seriously going out of my budget... we'll see).  There are a bunch of other things we didn't get to do, but hopefully next time we can island hop.  Anyhoo, it was nice to have a week off of work.  If you want to see more pics, let me know.
