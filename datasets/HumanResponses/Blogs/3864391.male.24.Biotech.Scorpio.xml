      I can't stand hearing husbands complain that they are not getting enough sex. And even worse, i can't stand how wives believe that this is the way it's supposed to be--once you are married, the sex life goes down the drain. That's a bunch of BS.  The average couple probably has sex 2-3 times per week. But there are men out there in relationships where 2-3 times per month is the norm! 2-3 times a month!! Isn't that just ridiculous? Why is this the case? Most likely the wives are tired. Tired from what? From work, children, house work, cooking--sure i can understand that. But 2-3 times a month! If i were in that position, things would certainly not be well.  So you have a husband who doesn't have enough sex and a wife who is too tired. Soon enough, there will be conflicting feelings. He's feeling pissed off because his wife is giving him any and then you have a wife who thinks he's sex crazed and demanding. Soon enough, the husband gives up the asking/initiation of sex, and would most likely just give up on the whole relationship. As a result, the wife would not think that they are in love, would think the marriage isn't working, and would probably, to keep her mind off of it, work harder, focus energies on the children, etc. and, more importantly,pay NO attention to the husband thereby furthering this downward spiral. So what happens? Either they become those dreaded "stay married for the children and sleep in separate room" couples, or the husband or wife would start straying to that new assistant in accounting. And in the end, you have the US average of 50% of marrianges ending in divorce.  A guy needs sex, not only to get his rocks off, but it's also a form of intimacy, a way that the wife tells him, in a way that men truly understand, that she loves him. You can say "i love you" so many times a day to your husband, but nothing expresses it more than showing him that, and nothing reinforces it more than making love regularly so that both husband and wife are happy. To expect the husband to be happy with whatever he gets is incredibly unrealistic.   Let's say that you, the wife, miss those conversations in front a candle-lit dinner with your loved one. It's hard to have moments like that with kids running around and you know that your hubby is tired from a long day's work.  But if you don't have these "dates", the relationship of a marriage will start to deteriorate, right? So what must happen? The husband should start to try to make time for conversations, for dinners, for dates, etc.    The same applies for the wife. You ladies gotta give him what he needs. Regardless of how you feel at that time, if you're in the mood or not, etc. Couples nowadays have fotgotten that a relationship requires work! They focus attention on their jobs, on their children, on their hobbies, but never on each other. By the time bedtime rolls around, they're snoozing away! I don't know why this is so hard to understand. If you can't keep the relationship going, if you are too tired to have sex, then you have too much on your plate. Both, husband and wife, have to divide responsibilities to make time for each other, for conversations, for sex, just like for all the other commitments that they have throughout the day.  And for those other women who just give it to your husband just to give it to them--your relationship is already in trouble. Things are going to go downhill and i ENCOURAGE you to prove me wrong. Unless your man only wants it once a month, it isn't going to work.   I'm not saying that if you have sex a lot, then your marriage will thrive. What i am saying is that it is neccessary to have a healthy sexual relationship in order to provide the proper foundations for a thriving marriage.  Makes sense huh? So then why aren't you ladies doing it?

      I'm sick of all this crap of people missing Bertuzzi and how they just want him back. It's so ridiculous.  Let's take a look at what happened, shall we?   We all know Bertuzzi sucker punched Moore in the neck, from BEHIND. Again, let me stress that he didn't sucker punch the guy up front, but from behind. Man, where are all the psychologists on this one? He wasn't even man enough to punnch a guy, in the game of hockey, straight up. So what does he do? He sucker punches Moore. But he's not even man enough to sucher punch him straight up. So what does he do? He punches Moore in the neck from behind.   Now that's pretty honourable of him. Even in the game of hockey where fighting is "part of the game", we're talking about sucker punching from behind. Is sucker punching from behind part of the game?   Now there's talk that Bertuzzi didn't actually damage Moore's neck, but was probably the fall itself that did the damage. Um, what if i told that you saw me shoot your 4 year old daughter from behind then tried to sell it to you as if it was the bullet itself that killed your daughter but not me. Or, better yet, it was the injuries, itself, sustained from my bullet that killed your daughter as opposed to the bullet itself. Do you see how ridiculous this is?  ABut people have said that he has apologized and cried on national TV and that he's taken a salary hit. He's not really that much of a threat to society either. And there shouldn't be a trial, since the NHL should be handling this. Sure, i can agree with all this. But i do have one thing to say, the guy's now a potential threat to players in the NHL.  Better yet, he's a target for even more retaliation acts from other teams. That can't be good.  And i can't stand the people that want him back. To all of those Bertuzzi fans out there, would you feel the same way towards someone else who may have hypothetically sucker punched Bertuzzi in the neck from behind? At least, would you be more understanding? I think not.   He doesn't have to go jail, but i think he's done for.

      Doesn't it just boggle the mind when you see a not-so-good looking girl complaining about her curernt man just isn't attractive enough for her? Is this not paradoxical some how? Perhaps a little hypocritical, don't you think? I would certainly say so!   Just picture it now: a lady sitting across from you, is a slobby, pasty skinned, somewhat flabby, boy-faced girl telling her friend that she just isn't attracted to her current prospect. Why? because he isn't good-looking enough. She says she tried to instill an attractedness to him but she still concludes that she HAS TO HAVE a hot, athletic, man by her side.   But she said she  tried . I don't care whether she tried or not. Hell, i've tried to walk around the office with my eyes closed, and had great difficulty, but doesn't mean it can't be done!   What we have to introduce here is the truth that two worlds exist: the chooser world and the beggers world. You see, me stumbling around the office with my eyes shut is an example of me  choosing  to close my eyelids and meandering throughout the office, into desks, file cabinets, and water coolers. Now let's assume I was blind. If this were the case, I have no other choice and must learn to walk around the office with no visual cues whatsoever. In fact, i would initially be  begging  for my eye-sight to come back!  And guess what? there exists a world of women (and men) who are confused. And i'm not talking "calculus-confused"--i'm talking about "woke up in someone else's bed, can't remember a single thing, with a huge tattoo of Chandler Bing's face on her back and she doesn't even know it-confused." This type of woman is an ugly woman who feels that she has an option of having an attractive partner. That type of woman is in the wrong world--a begger in a chooser's world.  This type of girl should be begging for some guy to pick her up--it is highly unlikely that she can choose an attractive mate!    So what fuels such craziness? Primarily the belief  that they are attractive. Who makes them feel this way? is it possible that the guys make them feel this way? Nope. We, us guys, do not make them believe that they are attractive. In fact, we try to make it known that they are not that attractive with our countless porn, maxim, coors models. Hell even girls are helping us with all those Teen and Cosmo magazines.   So then, what is it?  It has to be the men, some may say! It's the men that give these ugly women attention. True, there are men out there that will give them attention. These men may be decent looking, good looking, or horrible looking. But regardless of their physical atractiveness, men are men. We want sex and toss beer in the mix and you got men dancing and grinding with any girl that will give him the attention. Men want sex. We are like robots. u dangle pussy, we reach for it. It doesn't get any simpler than that.   So who's responsible for placing the beggar women in a chooser's world? the begger women themselves are! It is the women who  interpret  our actions as means of judging attractiveness. We are not judges of attractiveness. With our good friend, Jack Daniels, we don't care! In fact, it's the women who judge each other. Every where you turn, you got women staring at each other, looking at what they are wearing, seeing if that purse is real, etc, etc. We just hump women. We are impartial to attractiveness to such a degree that we are unreliable judges. But what do women do? They interpret our sleeping with them as a means to measure their attractiveness. An ugly women can have multiple sexual partners and still be ugly, right? You see, the women did it themselves!   So now you've got begger women in a chooser's world because of their own misinterpretations. I don't know if they can ever leave that world. They have it so well, in their own mind, in that world that I don't think they'll ever cross over. But they're gonna have to--especially if they want to get married.   But until that happens, we have a beggar-chooser world imbalance.  And as well all know, imbalances in life is not a good thing. So how do we restore balance? It's just a matter of these women accepting the truth and living in their respective world. Kind of like a blind man realizing he is ultimately blind and working with that. Unfortunately, for those that do not have any 'foresight' (refer to entries below) into their longterm relationship goals (ie. marriage, fullfilling relationship), they will still think that they deserve a hot hubby. Guess what, ain't gonna happen.  Unless of course, you're rich.   Sucks doesn't it? Guys are in this situation all the time.

      I was walking along the city streets the other weekend. It was a hot afternoon and it was crazy busy. It's a popular strip in the city where people go shopping, show off their cars, show off their stereo systems, show off their tans. It's a lively area and i love strolling down there amusing myself with all the hot women there.  Sometimes, i just like to do a little shopping with my friends as well.    Passing along one block, i notice a group called the Falon Dafa. You know these guys? These are the guys you see on the streets, parks, university campuses that meditate all day in interesting, almost tai chi-like, poses.  I guess you don't have to be asian to be in the group, but it's a chinese based group/following, and it originates from chinese culture. Anyway, this group had some demonstrations of members mimicking the tortured prisoners in China. They had the fake blood, the fake cages, the bad jail house officials mimicking the physical abuses--everything. And then of course, you have your huge banners with Falon Dafa written on it and a spokesperson describing the situation in China. Boy, these people must care!  Funny enough. I don't understand how this is going to help the tortured prisoners there. How is my money, given to the Falon Dafa, and practicing meditational exercises going to help free these tortured prisoners? You people see where i'm going with this?   You see this all the time! I just love the protesters that care so much about the people in Iraq suffering needlessly and that war must be avoided at all costs. If these protesters really give a damn, and give that much of a damn, then go to iraq and help them there. I don't understand how them yelling in my ears, or yelling on camera, is supposed to help the people of Iraq.  Do they really think that the Iraqees are at home watching North American, let alone Canadian, television and nodding their hands in emotional agreement and thanking us that we are protesting on our home grounds? Do you really think they appreciate that, considering that their relatives are injured, if not dead,  and that a bombing is about a house away?    And i'm sure these protesters, sometime on that saturday afternoon, say to each other "Man i'm hot. Is it 2pm yet? I'll be right back, i'm gonna go to the 7/11, grab a slurpee."  I'm sure if you ever tried going to the 7/11 (or its equivalent) in iraq, you could get shot, mugged, beat, killed, maimed, bombed, or bitten by some insect, let alone the scorching sun!   I'm just saying that people that care about these situations should act on them. And not act on them like "ptotesting-act" on them..i mean, getting yourself a plane ticket and going down there to really create attention. Could you imagine how meaningful it would be to see these protesters on the news because they may be beheaded? Now that's something!  Look i'm not saying that the US going to war with Iraq is good or bad. But i'll say this: The US going to War in Iraq is understandable. I mean, the intentions are good, but the turn outs are not so good. It is war, so it's gotta be ugly.   It's like this, for example: If you were married but drunkenly made out with your husband/wife's best friend, would you tell your husband/wife? Well, the RIGHT thing to do would be to tell the husband/wife. The practical thing to do would be to not say anything at all. If you were to tell the truth, the truth, my friends, can be ugly and result in ugly consequences.  And this is reflective of the war in Iraq. Problem is, Iraq isn't your wife/husband. Iraq's (and i'm not talking about the good people down there) an ugly terrorist. So it's a tricky situation. Hell i don't think you guys can even figure out how to deal with your husband/wife!   So for all of those who care so damn much, voicing your opinions on your homeland downtown streets, why don't you take that extra step and actually do something useful? If i care about my wife, i don't tell everyone how i'm GOING TO take her out for dinner. I just take her out for dinner.

      It's a saturday summer evening, the sun is still out and so are the drivers.  Traffic is light and a brown caravan is behind a toyota corolla, maybe 2-3 car lengths apart.  The streets are not jammed and no one is dramatically exceeding speed limits. They're both travelling in the left lane when all of a sudden the caravan brake lights are shun and he stops because of the left turner in front of her.  The kicker: the left turning corolla signalled almost a block and half ahead of time before stopping at the intersection to make the turn.  question: so why didn't the driver of the caravan just use a little foresight to see that the corolla ahead of her is going to make a left turn and just pass her on the right? Where was the foresight?   Now i ask you women out there: where is your foresight? When was the last time women have thought about the pros and cons of acting like an extremely moody, some would say bitchy, person simply because it is that time of month? Probably never. When you see husbands begging for sex, and wonder why many men cheat, hire prostitutes, watch a huge load of porn--can't you see a solution? Make more love. When you see that your man is working hard to pay off a mortgage and is very tight with the budget, is it really in your best interest to ask him right when he gets home to take you out for an expensive dinner? Probably not.  The point being: you think before you do. Simple isn't it? Just make sure that you can apply that principle in all respects. And a guy like myself will mirror such behaviour towards you. Would i be more inclined to take you out for dinner if you were not hassling me? Would i be more aware of your bitchiness during that time of month and give you a massage when i see you make effort in trying to minimize the mood swings? Would i be more understanding if you are trully too tired for sex or simply not in the mood, knowing that, for the most part, we have sex regularly and frequently? the answer is yes.  When you see the car ahead of you with her left turn signal flashing and you know it will have to stop at the intersection, what would you do? Change lanes.  I do it all the time.
