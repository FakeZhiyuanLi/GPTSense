      Tiffani and I are talking on the phone, pondering our first post. Pondering is hindered by several factors:  1)  Both of us are hungover.  Since much of our pondering is done drunk or hungover, this should not be an issue. Moving on to 2) It's early afternoon, and both of us are scummy from last night's drinking (in separate cities), from too much morning coffee, and from too many morning  cigarettes. Because this is standard morning-into-afternoon pondering  state, this should not be an issue.  Moving on then to 3) It's Memorial Day--gorgeous in one city, gloomy in another--and both of us should be  either writing (journal articles, not a joint blog post) or "enjoying  the holiday."  Since we now seem to be pondering why we can't ponder,  we accept a non-pondering ponder position.  Perhaps we should say a bit about how this blog came about.  Candi:  Hey Tiff.  Why did we decide to start this blog? Tiffani: Well, I seem to think that the idea came to me when I was in  town last week.  I was still drunk from the night before, and I was reading academic blogs.  I just didn't feel that they spoke to our concerns. Candi:  Do we have--or what we have, can it be called--concerns? Tiffani:  Perhaps "concerns" is too strong a word.  I feel like our dialogue is stilted, man. Candi:  Yeah. Blogging dialogue sucks. Tiffani:  Whatever.  What are we going to do here? Candi:  Talk about the breakdown in the system. Tiffani:  Yeah.  How do we explain "the system"? Candi:  Well, the system is huge, bigger than we know.  Right now, our flash of insight into the system has to do with condoms. Tiffani: Condoms. Candi:  They won't use them. Tiffani: It used to be so seamless. Candi: All it used to take was, "Do you have something?" Tiffani: That was it. Then there was protected fucking,  with no discussion. Candi: I think the breakdown in the system occurred some time around Y2K. Y2K, turns out, was not about the worldwide breakdown of computer systems.  It was about cum, unrestrained cum. Tiffani: Yeah, man, Y2K = why would you use a condom? Candi: A post-Y2K world, man, semen everywhere, just never in a condom. Tiffani:  Yeah, there was semen everywhere, but mainly inside of me,  on Saturday morning. Candi:  Yeah, my on-the-rebound-from-someone-else ex-boyfriend decided on the "pull-out method" with me on Wednesday night.  This is not a birth-control method. Tiffani: It, like the "rhythm method," is fully endorsed by Pope John Paul II.   Do you think that the popularity of _The Da Vinci Code_ and _The Passion of  the Christ_ has anything to do with the breakdown? Candi:  The system has been affected by those texts, I am sure. Tiffani: I don't think most of the boys I fuck can read. Candi:  Even Saturday-morning guy? Tiffani: He has a Ph.D. in Rhetoric & Composition but not a book in that house.  So there's a little taste. We love you all very much [another part of the blog will contain a bit on inappropriate sign-offs, in casual conversation as well as other discourse].   Cheers, Candi & Tiff

      Ok, so I read through my student evaluations and they actually made me sort of happy.  Apparently I am a BRILLIANT actress and I have convinced all of my students  1.  that I love my job. 2.  that I love teaching them. 3.  that I am excited about the material. 4.  that I know a great deal about the material, and that I plan all of the classes that I teach extensively, and not on my ten-minute drive to work.  But this is not the point of this post.  The point of this post is that a student wrote on one of my evaluations that sometimes I can be absent-minded but that it is, and I quote, "cute."  WHAT THE FUCK?  If a male professor is absent-minded, is he cute?  Because I suspect he's not.  I suspect that he's a. just absent-minded and thus professorial or b. considered to be an asshole because he forgets things.  I am APPALLED that this crap makes its way into my evaluations.  In the past I've also been told that I'd look prettier if I smiled more, so this "cute" thing is just a continuation of something I've been dealing with for years.  Ok, but even more annoying than all of this is the fact that I think men in my life actually "evaluate" me similarly.  Let's look at some of the compliments I've received in the past month or two, and I will show you their corrollary comments from my student evaluations:  Rhett:  "I think you're refreshing."  Student evaluation:  "Very enthusiastic and upbeat and interesting."  Flake: "You know, Tiff, you're really fun."   (I know I've not introduced Flake, but I will in a future post.  He's a piece of work.) Student evaluation: "She made class fun."  Lancelot:  "I really think you're the bee's knees." (Ok, I'm not kidding - he actually said that and apparently others in his world say this as a normal compliment.  The only person I know who uses these sorts of phrases is my mentally challenged aunt, who favors terms like "shucks" and "gol dangit."  I laughed when he said it, which I think hurt his feelings, but jeez - it's not 1900.) Student evaluation: "you are AWESOME."  Maybe I should start giving my suitors the standard evaluation forms and then I could figure out what my weaknesses are similarly?  Are my dating weaknesses the same as my teaching weaknesses?  Is the problem that I'm often late, seem too sophisticated and like I talk down to people, that I take too long to give feedback on their efforts?

      Well, I am back home again, out of the bosom of my family, and I have returned to the following:  1.  The news that an essay I had proposed for a collection was rejected.  (This is actually not the worst news in the world, as I have not written said essay and don't have time to write it, but nevertheless, a blow to the ego.) 2.  My student evaluations from Spring semester (enough said). 3.  The news that I didn't pay some sort of city tax in 2002 and might be sent to jail (must call somebody to try to get this straightened out before I'm locked up).  Romantically, things aren't much better.  I worked up the nerve to call Rhett last night (believing that he didn't love me but really hoping he'd be excited to hear from me) and when the phone picked up, all I got was his stupid answering machine.  Thus, I had to leave a stupid message.  He did not call back.  I think he's left town for the week and won't be back until after the 4th.  If this is the case, I do believe the least he could have done would have been to drop me an email regarding his plans.  Now, I'm (unreasonably) pissed off and may need to try to fuck my neighbor, who is very stressed out and thus could really use a good fucking to improve his mental/physical/emotional well-being.  In fact, I think I would be doing a valuable public service were I to assist him in this fashion.  The question is, can this be counted as service in one's tenure file?

      Well, friends, after the idiotic posts of recent weeks, I fear that this chapter must come to a close.  I am currently visiting family and friends and once this is done I will return home to my manuscript, my syllabi, my life as a monastic scholar.  Well, I hope that the monastic part will be more figurative than literal, as I would really like for things with myself and Rhett to continue along in the progression that began prior to my untimely departure.  Nevertheless, I cannot live the life I've been living and hope to achieve tenure.    Thus, I'm going to attempt to finish revision notes on a couple of chapters today, and to organize a schedule for myself for the immediate days following my return.  Boring, I know.  Still, I have been having the sense that this blog has become a series of pathetic, idiotic kiss-and-tell stories, and the truth is that isn't my everyday life.  I also think that perhaps if I go back to my everyday life that Candi will be inspired to do all of the things that are making her anxious by not doing them.  My antics are nothing if not a distraction.  Caveat: I fear that I'm turning over this particular new leaf out of a subconscious desire to settle down with Rhett into an actual relationship, wooing him with my intellect and respectability, which is actually more idiotic than the rest, as I am actually convinced that he does not love me and has found some person to bang who believes in the positive, real-world potential of protest.

      That would be me, Candi Davidovich.  Sorry to sign off last time with the dramatic suggestion that I might OD on Percocet. Lovely, lovely friend only gave me two tablets, and I still have one-half of one left. In my defense, I can only say that I was probably anticipating the lameness that would be my life in the then-coming week and therefore created for our fan base the illusion that I might be absent due to an untimely, unintentional, and unfortunate self-induced demise (a  la Lily Bart).  I have been spending most of my time fretting about not working.  June was my month to a) tweak existing syllabi; b) design new course; c) order books; d) write and submit journal articles.  Have done none of the above. July will be spent being visited by mother, visiting sister and her kids, and then spending a week with friends in rented house  on beautiful island in North Atlantic.  No possibility of work in July.  August will be spent (must have known this) freaking out about not having done a, b, c, or d and thereby setting  myself up for another year of incredible stress which will leave me in current burnt-out state once again at the end of the next year. Vicious cycle, eh?  Possible reasons for current state of academic paralysis:  1)  Energy level of fossilized shit.  (Could overcome this by doing research, which gives me energy, but can or will not or telling self that I can not so I will not have to or that I have to so I will not.)  2)  Complete and necessary stall after year of frenzied activity. (If this is true, why can't I just accept and enjoy the non-activity?)  3)  Loneliness.  4)  Alcoholism, exacerbated by 3).   What I have been doing instead of doing actual, meaningful, fulfilling things:  1) Fucking Sam.  (There was a surprising run of well-oiled system functioning, until last night's breakdown when the withdrawal  method was once again re-introduced as a viable birth-control option.  Erection function--of course, under these deluded  circumstances--perfect.)  2) Missing Meth.  (The person, Meth--my ex-boyfriend--not  the drug. I have yet to write about Meth, who is deserving of a whole series of entries if not an entire blog.  Meth  and I broke up a year ago, and I am still reeling.  Meth  and I were madly and completely in love, which is of course why we can not be together.)  3) Reading Augusten Burroughs (_Dry_), the second Bridget Jones  (_Edge of Reason_), and Jeffrey Eugenides (_Middlesex_).  Totally identified with Burroughs (scary), consumed _Edge_ like it was an  ice-cream sundae sprinkled with cocaine (which it kind of is), and having trouble being interested in narrator in  _Middlesex_ (phobic?).  4) Drinking to excess. (Surprise.)  Why oh why don't I just get off my ass and do some work?  Or, if  not, why not decorate condo (wait, no $) or start running/exercise program (would relieve depression and will make me beautiful for upcoming bikini debut).  At least clean apartment for mom visit? At least catch up on real reading?  Clearly Teen Candi (my rebellious sixteen-year-old alter-ego) is in  full sabotage mode.  Must retire to roof with glass of red wine and cigs to ponder.

      Well, the title pretty much says it all, doesn't it?  Except, of course, it doesn't, because there was actually much more.  Quickly: I LOVED Lancelot's relatives, had an EXCELLENT time, and only on the last night, after we had had some pretty serious conversations and emotional moments, I thought to myself, what's the harm in being with Lance in that way?  We only see each other at most every other year.... It could be sort of nice and comfy....  My friends, I have never worked so hard in my life to have such an unsatisfactory sexual experience.  Lancelot, though otherwise lovely, just can't seem reliably to get and/or maintain an erection.  Often, this is because he's been drinking for hours and hours, and that sort of thing I guess just comes with the territory.  But on the last night of my trip, the Drink was not the problem.  The problem was that he was "nervous" because he's been in the middle of a bit of a dry spell (think more than a year).  I hate to be shallow, but an erect cock is really important to me.  Still, even more important than that is for the man with the limp dick to roll with the punches and not get all weird and apologetic and upset.  How can I possibly manage to assuage anxiety at the same time that I'm trying to get things going?  I can't.  And so I gave up.  And it was just.... unsatisfactory.  For both of us, I imagine.  At any rate.  Lancelot clearly is in love with me (or the me he has imagined exist and not the real me at all) and I just hope that in the coming year he meets a nice girl who appreciates:  1. His affectionate nature (which I find clingy and irritating). 2. His sensitivity (which I find pathetic and irritating). 3. His intelligence (which I appreciate except for when I think he's being a pompous asshole).  In the meantime, my exploits here have made me think more and more about Rhett and the fact that I might (gasp) actually LIKE him.  You know, in that 7th grade "do you like him?" sort of a way.  This is terrifying, and I fear that he has forgotten all about me during my absence.  Ah well, I'll know more about that when I see him.  I believe that's all to report here, so I will close with a suggestion for any male readers we might have: If you have systematic problems getting and/or keeping it up, you should 1. stop drinking (or doing drugs, if that applies) for a while and see if things work better, 2. get proper exercise, 3. see a doctor, and, if all else fails, 4. get therapy. Erections DO matter to women and if you have repeated problems in this area, even if women say it doesn't matter, it does.  Additionally, if I'm meant to be doing Kegel exercises and reading all of the crap in women's magazines about how to jerk men off properly (etc.) a little effort in this area is the least that you can provide.  Have a nice day!

      Well, where to begin.  I hadn't thought I'd be posting until I was back stateside, but I have a few hours to kill before I head off with Lancelot and his uncle to the ancestral lands of their family, and so I'm posting.    I am completely certain of the following: 1. Lancelot is in love with me (for real) and I toy with his emotions by getting drunk and being overly affectionate (i.e., naked). 2. Tex was here, it was confirmed last night, but I never laid eyes on him (which was probably for the best).  I am fairly certain of the fact that: 1. I am still drunk. 2. Everyone in the whole world (i.e., my colleagues of this week) knows about #1 above. 3. I gave my card to at least 5 people last night, as I am an idiot and am very excited to give my card to anyone because I now have a card.  I am uncertain about: 1. How things will go over the next three days in the ancestral lands. 2. How to explain to Lancelot that I am not in love with him and cannot be in love with him but rather just love him as my friend, in spite of the fact that I am occasionally naked with him. 3. When the drinking will slow.  Questions for today: 1. How will I survive the next three days in the ancestral lands? 2. How will I stop Lancelot from trying to make moves on me in the ancestral lands, especially as I expect I will be drunk and will have little motivation to stop him? 3. What am I going to do with myself for the next 2 and a half hours? 4. Why can I not seem to be a stuffy professor but instead always end up being a horny one? 5. Is it possible to pretend last night didn't happen?  Oh, god. God, god, god, god. Alcohol is a poison.

      Well, my trip continues and it continues to include a great deal of alcohol and intellectual conversation.    Things I have realized:  1.  The time has come for me to be proactive about things like organizing people to do conference panels, an essay collection, etc.  Waiting around for others to do it is why so many of us - in spite of stellar degrees and minds, etc.- have had such trouble establishing ourselves in the academy.  The academy sucks, but if we're going to be academics we need to make sure people notice that we're on the scene.  2. I think Lancelot really believes that we will live happily ever after someday.  I know that this will not happen.  I do not want this to happen.  This is a problem.    3. I think I'm being accidentally monogamous with Rhett.  This, too, is a problem.  4. It is very difficult to drink to excess every night of the week when one is no longer 19 years old.  More when I'm back stateside, Tiff

      I hardly know what to write, as I have either been drunk or thinking, or thinking while drunk (not recommended) over the past five days.  I adopted the tone of an international spy in my email to Candi because I was at a terminal next to my friend Caesar, whom though typing furiously I suspect might have been interested in snooping on my correspondence. I should probably mention that he is in a serious, committed relationship and that I find him WILDLY attractive.   Update on Lancelot: he drunkenly slurred something to me last night about giving me "space" since the naked non-sex love-talk night because he "thought that's what I wanted."  I drunkenly replied "Lancelot, what are you talking about?" (actually, said that a few times because there is an accent barrier that separates us - especially when consuming vast, vast quantities of alcohol) and then "I thought everything was fine.  Stop being a freak."  Clearly, I am not a caring, nice, sensitive person.  In fact, I am an asshole.  After that basically ignored him for the rest of the night flitting from one man to the next, most of whom are married, most of whom I want to bang.  Things that I have learned on my trip so far: 1.  It is very difficult to drink to excess 5 nights in a row after a certain age. 2.  Nobody says anything if you smoke marijuana in a pub in plain sight if others are smoking roll-your-own cigs. 3.  Lungs do not fall out of your chest if you smoke more than 40 cigarettes a day (although they do feel like they might). 4.  I may well be the smartest girl in the whole world.  (4 is clearly the alcohol that is left in my system still talking)  I will report when able - otherwise, I will rely on Candi to keep you all abreast of my movements.  Oh, but also....  5.  Guinness really can suffice as a meal if no food is easily attainable.

      Got the following email from Tiffani:  You will need to update people of my movements on the blog because I don't have time (or privacy) to write extensively at the moment.  Let's just say that I told Lancelot that we can't be anything more than friends because I love him and it would be wrong.  (Realize this seems counterintuitive, esp. as I was not wearing clothes, but whatever.)  Much drinking and more to follow.  No sightings of Tex.   xo Tiff   Hmmm . . . so very mysterious.  In her drunkenness, Tiff has adopted the tone of an international spy. Why so guarded? Who is watching her? Has the internet cafe been infiltrated?  By whom?    Keeping things on the friend level with Lancelot while rolling around naked with him does not seem in any way counter-intuitive to me.  But then again, I am an idiot.  Will report on my own adventures soon.  I am fretting about money and therefore no fun at all.  A lovely, lovely friend has given me some lovely, lovely Percocet (one of my favorite things in the world), so I expect that my upcoming activities will be of no note (as my love affair with Percocet usually only involves drooling on  my pillow while watching hours of QVC--not pretty, I know).   Send money . . . and pills.

      Candi here.  Sorry to have been away from our humble blog for so long.  Have been very busy with idiotic repetition of my  already-happened-three-years-ago relationship with Sam the Pig. Such repetition is idiotic because a) it's already happened once and we  know how it goes; and/or b) as you know,  Sam is  on the rebound, so it could conceivably go much  worse this time around.  In any case--Sam is a pig, but a sweet, sweet, lovable pig and it is all very nice as long as I don't think about consequences (which I am of course very VERY skilled at doing).  The biggest problem is that this all makes for pretty  boring blogging fare. Actually. . .nasty consequences would be better for the blog.  Hmmm . . . have I finally found the perfect excuse for making disasterous decisions? According to Laura Mulvey (film theory, read it), "sadism demands a story."  Masochism too?  I find myself,  more than ever, living for the story. If it's not good enough to report to you, dear readers, it is not good enough to do.  So, some peripheral idiocy of the past week or so?  1. Nash is a great friend who is truly interested in me and my well-being.  Nash would hit me in the face if he knew I was re-involved with Sam. Nash wants to make plans for my birthday (coming in the next few weeks . . . I lied in my profile, saying my birthday was April 23--Shakespeare's birthday, by the way. . . the year is right, though, and I will be 38).  I could not be less romantically interested in Nash.  2. Saw Frisco's and Remy's band play at Frog.  Always weird to watch a band when you have banged half of said band. Especially weird when Remy's girlfriend and also my friend, Isabella, is in attendance and doesn't know that you have banged half the band, at least her quarter of it.  Remy and I continue (since the threesome) to fall into bed together every drunken now and then.  Bad, very bad.  Remy, while on tour with another band this Spring, left the following message on my voice mail:  "[Extremely slurred]  Listen,  I think I really love you.  But don't tell anyone [fit of strange drunk giggling]: it would totally blow my cover. You are the most beautiful person I know, and I think I mean that."  Remy has been avoiding me for the past three weeks, since he's been off tour.  I could not be more interested in fucking Remy.  3.  Morris, ex-boyfriend circa 1986, left a message on my work voice mail.  Morris has been married for the past ten years. Every three or four years, Morris somehow finds me and rings  me up.  Sexy lawyer with the sexiest Southern drawl you can imagine. Sexy married lawyer.  Was not a sexy married lawyer in 1986. Was a sexy 20-year-old wearing no shirt and mardi-gras beads, tripping his ass off, and dancing to some band's cover of "Gloria" one balmy night in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. I, also tripping, thought he looked  exactly like Jim Morrison. We were inseparable for a short but  especially bloody (emotionally, unless you count the car wreck  in Mississippi en route from New Orleans, where we had just picked  up a shipment of Ecstasy . . . a federal narcotics agent hit my car,  no kidding. .  .funny story) nine months. I haven't seen the man in  nearly 20 years. I am very, very interested in returning his call.  The blogging was just interrupted by a random--random because, like I said,  he's been avoiding me for weeks--phone call from Remy, who  wanted me to interpret last night's dreams and who wants to hang out  today.  This blog has mysterious powers.

      Well, it's not a vacation entirely, and I'm only going to one country, but nevertheless.  I shall attempt to report from abroad (though I'm not convinced this blog has any readership since no one ever comments and it seems I just send all of this crap out into the ether....)  At any rate, must do many errands before I leave for the airport in 3.5 hours.  I am a procrastinating fool.  But some questions before I go:  1.  Will I have sex with Lancelot? 2.  Will I have sex with Tex? 3.  Will Rhett miss me or will he forget about me during the three weeks that I am gone? 4.  Is it creepy to send a drunken postcard to Fox?  Will this stop me? 5.  Am I dating Rhett?  (As you see, Fox and Rhett are all bound up in one another, as I cannot face the fact that a. I might be dating Rhett without my consent or knowledge and b. I could have and/or develop feelings for Rhett, thus forcing me to relinquish my freedom and settle into a kind of bizarre academic domesticity.)

      So, I saw my ex-student, Winston, today.  This was unexpected, as he graduated this spring.  One thing that rarely is discussed is the deep, and inappropriate, appreciation that female faculty can have for their sweet, youthful students.  There is a complete double-standard.  Somehow, there is this image of the lecherous male professor - whether old and disgusting (i.e., Harold Bloom) or young and dashing (i.e. the male professor in that silly movie Mona Lisa Smile) - that is repeated over and over in this culture, whereas the taboo desires of the female professoriate are completely ignored.  Perhaps such desires go undocumented because most female professors do not admit to them?  Is it because they do not act on them?  Perhaps such desires go undocumented because our culture continues to construct intellect as opposed to sexuality in women?  Whatever the case, I would fuck Winston blind if ever that opportunity fell into my lap (so to speak).  It is wrong, but it is a fact.

       Friday:   Rhett calls to ask Tiffani to a baseball game the following night (Saturday), and she says that would be swell.    Saturday:  - Rhett calls Tiff late in the day to confirm the plans, they go to the baseball game, have a fabulous time (but it's not decisively romantic).  - Leaving the game, Rhett turns to Tiff and asks, "So, what do you want to do now?"  Tiff responds, "I don't know, what do you want to do?"  (I apologize for the pathetic dialogue, but we were both a little drunk, and clearly I was not thinking about the Blog and trying to make the dialogue interesting but instead was trying to let him direct what would happen next, as he has a cock and so that is his job.)   - It is decided that they will get some beer and go back to his place to hang out on his deck. (Though I thought he said "dick" at first, which was slightly shocking, but I think I recovered from that Freudian mis-hearing quickly enough that he didn't catch on).  - Approximately three hours of conversation ensue.  Tiffani gets bored.  Rhett can't seem to find a way to bust a move, though he does seem like he wants to.  (I might have been projecting that onto him, though.)  - Tiffani, as a way of getting the ball rolling, says, "You, Rhett, are the biggest spaz in America," and goes and lays down in his bed.  Within 30 seconds, Rhett has joined Tiff in bed, and clothing is being removed, etc.  - Fucking.    Sunday:  - Tiffani awakens and makes coffee, naps, messes around with Rhett. (No condoms left, but, you will notice happily, no cum inside of me on this occasion.)   - Tiffani leaves, but not before having the long hugging of parting that feels slightly... not casual in the way that Tiffani is used to.    1.   If this was a "date," dates are actually pretty fun, which I had not previously believed.  I used to hate dates.   2.   If this was a "date," does that mean Rhett and I are "dating," and, if that is true, isn't that kind of fucked up?   3.   If this was a "date," am I doomed to trying to fuck my neighbor Fox out of fear of intimacy?  (By the way, I saw him yesterday, and yes, I would still like to fuck him.)  The bottom line is this: it is excellent that I will be out of town for approx. 3 weeks.

      It is 8:10 AM.     I am completely certain of the following:  1.  I woke up in my own bed, naked and confused. 2.  I watched the Paris Hilton Sex Video with Fox on his computer.   I am fairly certain of the fact that:  1.  I am still drunk. 2.  I have left cigarettes, a lighter, one of my orange plastic outside chairs, and a bra at Fox's apartment. 3.  I made out with Fox, hard core, last night.  When I say hard core, I mean that I have a distinct recollection of sucking his dick.  Not to fruition, but nevertheless.  I don't think I hallucinated this. 4.  Fox made me go home last night before we did anything really crazy, like fuck.   I am uncertain about:  1.  Did I talk to Nash and Candi on the phone after Fox sent me home? 2.  Did Fox send me away because I was horrifyingly drunk and unattractive? 3.  Did Solomon go home because it was apparent that Fox and I were going to make out? 4.  Do I reek of alcohol?   Questions for today:  1.  Is it possible to pretend that last night didn't happen? 2.  Is it possible to make out with Fox again, only this time with fucking as the conclusion? 3.  Will I be hung over later in the day or is it possible that I'm not currently drunk and thus will not be hung over?  Oh, god.  God, god, god, god.  Alcohol is a poison.

       Avoiding Real Intimacy by Pretending Intimacy Exists with People One Fucked Casually  You may be thinking to yourself that the Pretend Relationship (PR) is merely a kind of crush or stalking, but about that you would be wrong.  Indeed, the PR, as it has emerged in my sexual life, is really a lot more like a friendship, which has developed after fucking, that benefits from what my imagination can add to it.  The PRs allow me the romantic outlet I need with none of the pesky commitment, compromise, and caring of a real relationship.  And the beauty of them is that nobody needs to know about them but me, and thus I can end or begin a PR whenever the mood strikes me.  Right now I have two primary PRs, with a few others waiting in the background should the two primaries not be able to fulfill their duties.     Pretend Relationship #1  You may be surprised to find that my first PR is with Rhett.  I know I'm surprised to realize/admit this.  Last night I talked to him on the phone for like 3 hours.  He's been calling me every other day since we banged.  But he never asks me to do anything, and he doesn't seem to want to fuck me again.  Nevertheless, we have really deep conversations about theory, baseball, academe, creating a good and just world (the last being total crap, but I humor him because he is my pretend boyfriend).  The thing is, the talking to him makes me want to fuck him some more.  I fear that I want to bang his mind, which is really uncool, since the pretend relationships are supposed to be a way for me to avoid the real intimacy, which has to do with the mind.  I keep finding myself glad that I will be leaving for Europe in one week (Woohoo!) and thus can create some distance between myself and Rhett and fall back into mad love with PR #2.   Pretend Relationship #2  This one is much more romantic and adventurous, in spite of the fact that he, too, is a colleague of sorts.  Lancelot is from the UK, and I met him about 5 years ago when we were both graduate students.  To make a long story short, we fucked upon meeting one another (lovely) and have been friends with a strong undercurrent of pretend romance ever since.  We've only been in the same city for approximately 3 weeks of the entire time we've known one another, but there was a great epistolary affair the summer after we met, and we've basically been organizing ourselves to be pretend boyfriend-girlfriend this June, which will either be wonderful or horrible depending upon....   Pretend Other Man #1  I know, you weren't expecting this category.  There is a potential interloper who could ruin everything with Lancelot, who knows us both and whom I met around the same time that I met Lance.  See, Lance and I did fuck immediately upon meeting, and subsequent to that we did have a twinkling of a romance and did become great and lasting friends.  What Lance doesn't know, though, was that the third day after I met him, when he got so drunk that I had to help him go to the bathroom and put him to bed, I left him to pass out in his room and ended up having a Festival of Banging (FoB) with Tex.  Tex and I are NOT really friends, and I have NOT kept in consistent touch with him, but if I have the opportunity to fuck him I will do it with a song in my heart and a smile on my lips without any sort of care for the injury I will inflict on the sweet, true, pure heart of Lancelot.  Because I am a whore.  A heartless, crazy whore.

      For National Security Reasons.   (http://www.theonion.com/opinion/index.php?issue=4022)  From this week's The Onion...  "Thank you for your call, Alice. I got here as quickly as I could. Have you told anyone else? Thank God. You have no idea what a relief that is—not just for me, but for America. It is of the utmost importance that we keep this strictly between us.  I know that you must be very confused, even scared. I can't blame you. These things are always difficult. I wish I could explain everything to you—the greater context and the strategy at play here—but that would be in strict violation of National Security Agency protocol. I trust that it will suffice for me to inform you that you have been impregnated for national-security reasons."                      ...  There is a link between our national climate (both political and weather) and this "I won't come inside of you" trend across the nation.  The things that perplex me about this trend are too many to name, quite honestly, but I think that a little story I have to tell will offer some perspective....  Once upon a time, I, Tiffani Temple, had an involvement with a guy who worked for a national agency that is often in the news.  I'll call him Rocketboy.  Well, Rocketboy and I lived in different cities, but we "got together," so to speak, on Feb. 14.  I was at Rocketboy's dorm-like apartment after the bars had closed with my friend Eirra and his housemate Harvey Wallbanger, and Rocketboy and I retired to his newspaper-filled boudoir (more on the tendency for all of my conquests to have a newspaper accumulation problem in another post) to fuck.  Now, this was not the first time that Rocketboy and I had fucked, and he was fully aware that I am NOT on the pill and that condoms are a necessity.  Additionally, he had condoms and so did I.  However, Rocketboy says to me: "I want to fuck you without a condom; I want to make you pregnant" as if this is some sort of a turn-on for him.  I said "Like hell you will," and it was ultimately decided that he would come all over me (nice).  Nevertheless, as any of us who took health in 7th grade should be aware, the "withdrawal method" is not exactly endorsed by Planned Parenthood as effective birth control.  While it is true that Rocketboy ignored this fact the not one, not two, but THREE times we fucked, the morning after he freaked out.    He decided that I was pregnant.  He decided that there was a fictional pregnancy scare (which he contacted me regarding via email - I kid you not) and hounded me for 4 days regarding the state of my uterus.  You don't believe me?  Here's the first in his series of emails:  -----Original Message----- From: Rocketboy  Sent: Sunday, February 15, 2004 9:52 PM To: Tiffani Subject: RE: weekend plans  Hey Tiff, had a good time this weekend.  Hope you did too.  I just wish I  hadn't drank as much as I did.  Also, out of curiosity, are you on birth control by  any chance? Was VERY stupid of me not to use a condom.  Anyway, talk to ya' later.  R ----  As you see, Rocketboy isn't exactly a wordsmith.  But my point here is this: he knew exactly what he was doing when he fucked me "raw dog" (as Solomon puts it) but less than 24 hours later he changes his tune and acts like he was too drunk to know what he was doing.  This shift effectively makes a whore out of me and makes it seem like he regretted fucking me, which is rude.  Rhett did a similar thing in the aftermath of this weekend.  What is with this failure to take responsibility?  Why not just admit that he WANTED to fuck me without a condom and that he was INTO it and that I LET him do that (because I am an idiot)?  And then, after the fact, why hound me for details about what is really none of his business?  There is a strong connection between the unrestrained cum of the post-Y2K, post-9/11 world and the bizarre tendency for otherwise normal men to construct themselves as victims in sexual matters, while at the same time they are utterly self-important about their victimized state.  This is just one area in which the breakdown in the system is evident, and the fact that The Onion makes a joke of what is so close to my real life experience is disheartening at best.

      Woke up naked with long-time friend, Frisco, this  morning. Frisco is in from L.A.  Frisco and I have been fooling around for years, with frequent breaks in fooling around when we are in relationships.  Well, I stop fooling around with him (I think this is mostly true) when I am in a relationship. Frisco, on the other hand,is a wanton slut. Example: he put his also-visiting live-in girlfriend, an outrageously beautiful Peruvian  kindergarten teacher, on a plane back to L.A. yesterday  at 4 p.m. and was naked with me by midnight.   Here's the thing:  Frisco and I always, always have  lame sex.  Last night's excuse was condom-related. That's right: I was not a total idiot and insisted  that the breakdown in the system did not include Frisco putting his unclad dick in me.  Frisco, in addition to having fucked what I am sure is half the population of any given country, used to have a little heroin habit. He insists that he never shot up, but during one of his  visits I couldn't help but notice that several packs of my diabetic cat's syringes went missing.   Anyway, once outfitted, Frisco's dick went limp, limp, limp. There was other stuff we could do, of course, which we  half-heartedly did for about 20 minutes before sleep became much more interesting for both of us.  The truth is:  Frisco  and I just can't and never have been able to get it up for  each other.  Or it takes extreme measures, like the threesome we had last Spring with mutual best friend, Remy.  That was hot. Hot for me, because--well, two guys.  Hot for Frisco, I suspect, because he was really using me as a conduit to fuck his best friend.   Might have dinner tonight with on-the-rebound-from-someone-else ex-boyriend, Sam.  Interestingly enough, Sam is on the rebound from Amber, Frisco's ex-girlfriend.  Sam and Amber got together just after Sam and I broke up, when Amber was still dating Frisco. In fact, Frisco and Amber lived together in the spare room of Sam's house.  That's right:  Sam, a real pig, moved right in on his  then-best-friend's girl.  Frisco moved out, and Amber moved into Sam's room.  That was two years ago.  So, basically, I--after having had lame sex with Amber's next-to-last ex--am going to dinner tonight with Amber's most recent ex.  Incidentally, Sam and I--after not having spoken, unless you can count screaming at each other in bars, for most of the last two years (I was really furious about the pig  move)--have been screwing around for the past few months.  It occurs to me that most of this is hard to believe and would be rejected as such by any good literary agent. It's not fiction,  my friends. It's real-life idiocy.

      Obviously, this post is the first in a multi-part series.    What annoys me today is that I have this friend - Eirra - who has this habit of sending "uplifting" forwarded emails (though she never sends a real email to me, nor does she call me up on the phone - apparently, finding and forwarding all of these lame forwards takes all of her time that could be used for real communication).  I will include her email forward below, with my comments - oh, and I should probably note that these are often chain letters (sigh).  I've put the forward in  bold  and my comments are in plain text.   A little something to read that will make you feel good...   What would you do if every time you fell in love with someone you had to say good-bye?   Uh... isn't that how things work?  Because, you know, "everlasting love" does not exist?   What would you do if every time you wanted someone, they would never be there?  Again, I don't mean to be a cynic, but generally this is the way things tend to go.  And also, how exactly are these questions supposed to make one feel good?  In fact, I think they do the opposite, making one feel suicidal, not "good" at all.   What would you do if for every moment you were truly happy there would be 10 moments of sadness?   I think this is a really optimistic ratio of happy to sad.  And I'm a pretty happy person.     What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt?  Oh, yes, this really makes me feel good.  What the fuck? But, as you will see, all is explained in the below, sickeningly sweet conclusion, which is so sickeningly sweet, in fact, that I cannot comment on it but can only let it speak for itself.     So, I just wanted to say, even if I never talk to you again in my life, you are special to me and you have made a difference in my life. I look up to you, respect you, and truly cherish you.  Send this to all your friends, no matter how often you talk, or how close you are, and send it to the person who sent it to you. Let old friends know you haven't forgotten them, and tell new friends you never will. Remember, everyone needs a friend, someday you might feel like you have NO FRIENDS at all, just remember this e-mail and take comfort in knowing somebody out there cares about you ....and always will.  I'll Always Be There..... In times of trouble, In times of need, If you are feeling SAD, You can count on me. I will give you a wink, Until you smile, give you a hug, And stand by your side. I'll be there for you till the end, I'll always and forever, be your friend! INSTANTLY WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS, WHY NOT SEND IT TO AT LEAST 10 FRIENDS, INCLUDING THE PERSON WHO SENT IT TO YOU!     A word to all those who think that these sorts of emails are worth sending: Assholes.  You are assholes.  What you do is the equivalent of putting a piece of shit in somebody's real life mailbox.  Most people just delete these files of empty sentiments, but not before they are annoyed with you.  No one thinks you are sweet, and no one thinks that you are a good friend for forwarding sacharine, banal words written by somebody else.  [And, incidentally, my friend Eirra is pretty much never there during times of trouble, nor can one count on her for much, except of course to send these fucking forwarded emails.]

      I had not intended to post again today, but upon sneaking from my office (not entirely successful, as I ran into another professor, Amos, who had been with Rhett and me on Friday night before the Big Bang and I had to sort of... well... lie) I realized that what had once been a gorgeous, sunny, 80-degreee, summery day had become a crazy-threatening-skied world (ala _The Day After Tomorrow_) and thus my plan of going swimming this afternoon is in shambles.  I hate having an office without windows, but more than that I hate that the weather can change without a moment's notice.  Meteorology is a false science perpetrated on the unsuspecting by charlatans.  Candi, please offer your thoughts on this topic as well, as I think we both have a lot to say.  Ok, well, now that I'm trapped in the library during a torrential downpour, I suspect I must do some research.  I curse the skies!  Oh, but also: Why did I hide from Rhett (who, by the by, was in his office)?  Why did I want to avoid him?  Am I a bad person?  What?

      I'm not sure where to begin, as unlike Candi, I am not drunk.  In fact, I am in my office, having dragged my ass here with the intention of "getting things done" (which, obviously, is not happening).  I will need to "get things done" at some point, however, as I leave for Europe in a little over a week and if I do not "get things done" I will be royally (if not literally) screwed.  Speaking of which, I guess it makes sense for me to give a little background on my current situation:   Item #1:  As I mentioned in this blog's opening dialogue between myself and Candi, my holiday weekend began with a bang that had been a long time coming, but which was distinctly not the product of good (or sober) judgment.  You see, Saturday-morning-guy, aka Rhett, is a colleague.  This isn't a huge deal in any practical way, as I don't believe either of us will advertise our collegial fucking (well, except on the internet, apparently), but now I'm... in a kind of limbo with him that is uncomfortable and slightly weird.  Perhaps he is embarrassed because he kept saying things like "I'm going to fuck you all night long" while the fucking transpired?   Item #2: So I've got this neighbor, Fox, whom I met a few weeks ago and whom I've hung out with a few times.  Sunday night I end up hanging with him and his friend Solomon and a couple of things became clear to me:   A.  I have developed into the next-door-neighbor-floozie who dispenses sex advice(question from Solomon: is it ok to wake a girl up by having sex with her?  answer: a resounding yes; question from Fox: what do girls think about pearl necklaces? answer: Oh my god, I haven't heard that term since like seventh grade, and incidentally, how much porn do you watch?)    B.  I would like to have sex with Fox, although he is clearly an idiot, which has led me to begin a kind of uncool stalking of Fox, wherein I try to be outside if I hear him out there, and I keep track of whether he's home or not via observation of his car (and am annoyed when he parks in a spot that will not allow me to do this surreptitiously).   Item #3: My ex-first-love-asshole from high school/college (Yerf) called me drunkenly last night, on the way to have sex with one of his friends, to find out what was happening with Rhett and Fox (about which I stupidly told Yerf in an effort to get him to stop asking me when we would see each other, which did not work, incidentally) and for sex advice (once again, I am the floozie-to-whom-drunk-men-turn-for-information).  I could go on, but I would like to avoid seeing Rhett if possible, and so think I shall attempt to slip out of my office undetected in case he is here.  I am very much like a secret agent, what with my spying on Fox and my attempting to sneak past Rhett.  I am also very much like an idiot.

      In these early stages of the blog, I can not even imagine how many entries might be entitled "Drunk."  Anyway, I went to my favorite local bar this evening.  We may have not specified this thus far: the three dumb blondes live in three different cities.  This favorite local bar is one once shared by two of the three dumb blondes--Tiffani and Candi. Tiffani moved away, leaving a wide swath of confused men in her wake at said bar.   In any case, I--Candi--went to our bar (let's call it Frog) because I was bored, because I was procrastinating (my faculty report was due day before yesterday), and because I wanted to see some friends.  The life of a professor is a lonely life--one of solitary writing, smoking out of windows, fantasizing about Andrew Dan Jumbo on TLC.  One particular friend I wanted to see was . . . thinking of a code name . . . let's call him Nash.  I knew that Nash would be playing in this band that plays every Monday at Frog.  Dammit. No Nash.  But why do I care? Nash recently declared a crush for me.  I told Nash that I liked things the way they were--as friends. But I've thought of little else but Nash for days.  (Can we really count the thoughts of the on-the-rebound-from-someone-else ex-boyfriend?) Turns out I had a conversation with Karm, this kid who checked out my dissertation but never read it.  I--actually Tiff and I--went to this prestigious university in the Northeast.  Anyway, this kid--Karm--is getting his Ph.D. in neuro-science at this university. For whatever reason, he looks up, checks out,and starts to read my dissertation. He never makes it past the first fifteen pages. Why? Pynchon. The little shit is reading Pynchon.  _The Crying of Lot 49_ to be exact. Anyway, the kid is fuckable--so very fuckable--but he irritates me. Pynchon??  Karm wants to go to a bar down the street to hear Baje play. Baje is another ex-boyfriend. I am mad at Baje. Baje and I have been close friends since we broke up three years ago, but recently Baje suddenly acts like hanging out with me is akin to playing Canasta with blue-haireds in the nursing home. Whatever. I figure giving hot young Karm a ride to the Baje show will be a kick. And maybe Nash will be there.  Nash wasn't there. Karm ends up talking to Baje about how much he digs Baje's music--annoying to me, even more annoying to Baje--and I end up driving Karm back to Frog.  Why do I want to see Nash? Why do I *need* to see Nash? Where the fuck is Nash?   Left Fuckable Karm at Frog. Home.  At the end of a bag of Cheddar and Sour Cream Ruffles.  Are you starting to get it? Idiots.

      Breaking up with someone who is not one's boyfriend is a tricky enterprise.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I believe that is what I accomplished this weekend, and not for the first time in my life.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Basic steps to achieving a break-up&nbsp;from a non-relationship:  &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Have sex one last time.&nbsp;  (This might not be essential, but every one of these in my life has been preceded by crazy sex the night before, so I feel that it is an essential part of the process of&nbsp;letting go and healing.) &nbsp;  2.&nbsp; Call the person the next day and tell them that you just can't have sex anymore because you&nbsp;care&nbsp;too much.&nbsp;  (This seems counterintuitive, as for many people in&nbsp;our great nation sex is about caring.&nbsp; However, when those involved are idiots, this is&nbsp;a comfort, because idiots understand that if one cares about the person one has sex with than there is the danger of falling in love and getting hurt.) &nbsp;  3.&nbsp; Solidify the friendship by changing the subject, making a few jokes, and stating outright the following:  "Of&nbsp;COURSE&nbsp;I want to be your friend.&nbsp; I&nbsp;can't imagine not hanging out anymore or not having you in my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's exactly the reason why we need to stop the sex now - because if we continue,&nbsp;we might not be able to hang out anymore and that would suck."&nbsp; &nbsp; The first time I experienced the "we're not going out but we need to break up" scenario I was the break-ee and not the break-er.&nbsp; Narcissus and I had been hooking up for about a month, and I had no illusions that he was my boyfriend.&nbsp; He had this on-again, off-again relationship with Veruca, and let's just say that during the off-again periods he wasn't exactly... moderate... in his pursuit of sex.&nbsp; Additionally, he was in a crappy band (though at the time I was mesmerized by the fact that he was a musician... only retrospectively did I realize that they were crap).&nbsp; So yes, as a graduate student at a very good school, I did not think that something real could come of my dealings with Narcissus.&nbsp; But, when Narcissus went back on-again with Veruca, he broke up with me.&nbsp; At the time I found it a little bizarre, but then I realized that it was actually sort of great.&nbsp; No wondering whether he was blowing me off.&nbsp; No wondering whether he would change his mind after a week or two.&nbsp; No trolling around for gossip to try to figure out what he was doing or why he was doing it.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So after that, I entered into a pattern of breaking up with guys who were not my boyfriends.&nbsp; In general, it happens at some point between one and three months, and in general, it is a move that gets made when it becomes clear that the parties involved have to define things as casual because one or both parties doesn't want "anything romantic."&nbsp; Well, after Rhett's announcement on Friday, we hung out Friday night, I got hammered out of my mind, and we fucked.&nbsp; But then I called him Saturday afternoon and told him that I didn't want to have sex with him anymore.&nbsp; After that conversation I worried that I had been unfair to him because I never told him what I really felt about him or what I felt about the nature of our relationship, and I considered whether I should confess all of this to him after the fact (partly out of curiosity about whether his announcement was a preemptive strike because he thought I was casual about him when I really wasn't casual about him at all just terrified of relationships, which is different).&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; Well, I decided against calling him to confess all of that, though I will if/when it comes up more naturally.&nbsp; But it's over, at least for the time being.&nbsp; I just don't want him enough to do what it would take to make trying worth while. &nbsp; In other news, Fox has returned and I look forward to getting drunk with him, if not fucking him.&nbsp; Also, I'm writing like a maniac and I hope to be done with my chapter by the end of the week.&nbsp; At which time I plan to journey to my hometown to go to a bash with Jazi, and (I hope) to have a make-out session with a nice hometown boy who will not worry about feelings, collegiality, communication, or social justice and the possibilities for intervention and protest to change the world.&nbsp; Right now I think what I would rather is a boy who worries only about getting drunk, me being pretty, and making out.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Oh, you know the answer.&nbsp; Because I'm an idiot.

      Some interesting things from the blogosphere that, if we have readers, I would recommend checking out.&nbsp; First, the following about the MLA convention in  urlLink The Believer &nbsp;- many people at  urlLink Crooked Timber &nbsp;reacted really negatively to it, and I guess I see their points, but my honest reaction?&nbsp; Well, I think it read like an outsider talking about the MLA.&nbsp; If I went to an American Medical Association convention, I suspect I wouldn't understand half of what was going on and I would sound like an idiot in trying to pretend I did.&nbsp; That is my biggest problem with the essay (aside from the earnestness and the length) - it's that this guy went in thinking he understood what literary studies is about.&nbsp; Problematically, I'm not always sure I understand what literary studies is about  and I'm an English professor.&nbsp;  Go figure. &nbsp; Also, check out the  urlLink following proposal  for the 21st century college.&nbsp; I haven't read the whole thing - it's long - but it's interesting nonetheless - particularly interesting when I think about the crazy curriculum at my university.... &nbsp; (See, folks, I'm not  just  a boy-crazy freak - I am an intellectual who also just so happens to be single and to have a great deal of mental energy that she doesn't like to expend on great intellectual thoughts....) &nbsp; HOLY FUCKING SHIT!&nbsp; Ok, as I was typing that Rhett fucking came into my office and closed the door and gave me this whole thing about how he's not looking for something romantic right now and he doesn't want to be unfair to me and it all is because he saw his fucking ex-girlfriend when he was in Chicago (which I knew he did - I am psychic) and so there are "feelings there" but he does "care" about me.... Oh god.&nbsp; He is such a woman.&nbsp; And I am an idiot.&nbsp;

      Once upon a time (in like 1998) Candi found her One True Love, The Leprechaun.&nbsp; The Leprechaun, a portly, short man from Northern Ireland, a musician by trade and a TOTAL asshole, mesmerized Candi.&nbsp; With music that can cure the spins when one is hammered, this magical man, born on July 21, 1971,&nbsp;captured Candi's imagination and her heart. &nbsp; While Candi and The Leprechaun never had a "relationship" in the conventional sense of the word, they did have a special connection, a connection grounded in The Leprechaun's narcissism and Candi's obsessive dream that one day she might capture the wily Leprechaun and get her hands on his pot of gold (so to speak).&nbsp; Well, after much persistence, Candi did get her hands, etc., on the Leprechaun's pot of gold, but it wasn't as impressive as she'd hoped - in fact, as I had predicted with Cassandra-like clarity of vision, it was the worst thing that ever happened to her in her whole life.&nbsp; But never theless, a strange bond exists between Candi and The Leprechaun, and it is to that bond that The Leprechaun returns time and again when he makes important life decisions.&nbsp; Whether he's planning to move in with a girlfriend or getting married in three weeks (as he was at the time of their last encounter), he looks to Candi for the strength to carry on with his planned course of action (though that did sort of backfire last time, as Candi said to him that his getting married was the worst idea he'd ever had and that he wasn't the sort of person who would be good at being married or something to that effect).&nbsp;  &nbsp; So, why this story now?&nbsp; What does The Leprechaun have to do with anything?&nbsp; Oh, dear readers, I will tell you.&nbsp; The Leprechaun (remember: a short, portly man from Northern Ireland, a total asshole, a musician, and - let's be honest - not the most intellectual of fellows) was born ON THE EXACT SAME DAY - not just date, DAY - as Rhett.&nbsp; This throws my entire belief in astrology into question.&nbsp; But wait.&nbsp; Maybe it's the whole latitude/longitude effect on the horoscope?&nbsp; Or, I shudder to think, what if Rhett is a mythical creature trapped in a tall, skinny, college professor's body?&nbsp; What if trapped inside is a total asshole who leaps to and fro and has the power to cure the spins?&nbsp; Finally, what have I gotten myself into, and will this end up being the worst thing that's ever happened to me in my whole life? &nbsp; &nbsp;

      It seems that is what I have done, in response to the "take-care"-ing and no-calling of Rhett.  I have been reading all day, making notes for my manuscript, making plans for how to articulate all of my brilliant thoughts (ha!) in such a way that publishers will be banging down the door (ha!) and just generally remembering the pleasures of scholarship.    It's easy, after the dissertation is defended, to characterize the experience of researching/writing it as entirely horrible.  This is a lie.  There is pleasure in the pain of researching and writing.  There is satisfaction and excitement that results, and for which, in spite of my best efforts, I have found no duplicate in other experiences (like sex or getting hammered) that require less single-minded dedication.    Perhaps all academics - or even writers of any kind, or artists more generally - are masochists at heart.  Perhaps we have just found a way to channel that masochism that doesn't require the purchase of paraphernalia (often leather or vinyl) that would make one look silly or force one to become part of an alternative lifestyle?  Though, of course, academe is a kind of alternative lifestyle, and academics often do look silly....  I haven't worked out all of the kinks yet, but you see what I'm getting at.  (FYI: The title of this post comes from Seamus Heaney's _Station Island_ in case you, my imaginary reader, didn't catch the reference.)

      On the surface, there may seem to be nothing wrong with the above phrase as a closer to a conversation or encounter with another person.  On the surface, this may appear to be a completely polite, even nice, thing to say.  But when Rhett said to me, yesterday afternoon, as I was leaving his apartment after a night/morning of crazy sex, "take care," well, I've got to tell you, I felt like I was being blown off.  "Take care," in case one forgets, is a shortened form of "take care of yourself" - sort of like how "Best," is a short way of saying "Best wishes," or "Best regards."  If you tell a girl to "take care of herself" after you've fucked her senseless, she will feel like you don't really like her very much.  And this isn't just me.  I've consulted with friends, and we all feel this way about the "take care."  But nevertheless men across these great United States insist on the "take care" as a closer.  Do they interpret this as more intimate somehow than just the standard "goodbye," or, "I'll talk to you" (my closer of choice), or "I'll call you"?  Do they believe this phrase is better because it implies that they want you to continue on safe and unmarked by problems with health or well-being?  Or, is it really a phrase that is used with the intention of blowing a girl off, while still maintaining one's self-image as a "stand-up guy"?  (By the way, a post on the whole "stand-up guy" phenomenon is really in order, but it will have to wait.)  So anyway, yes, my news from the weekend is that I heard from Rhett on Friday (he called me immediately upon his return to town) and then we made plans to get together Saturday.  We had a couple of beers at his house and listened to the baseball game, then we went on to this bar, and then, a festival of fucking transpired.  It was all really quite lovely, until the whole "take care" thing.  Well, not entirely lovely, as I found myself wishing that he were my real-life boyfriend and not my colleague whom I fuck in secret.  And then, after me thinking along those lines, the "take care," which made me feel like I'm just an easy lay for him as opposed to being somebody whom he thinks about... with greater intentions.  Even if I just wanted to fuck the guy and didn't think about him with my own greater intentions, I still would be upset by the fact that he acted like he didn't have them, even if he didn't.  It's just not good manners.  And so now, I'm in my office, and he is on campus (as I know because fate gave me the parking spot next to his) and I suppose I should go say hello to him, though I'm anxious about seeing him in an academic context as I keep thinking about his cock and that isn't a train of thought that inspires the usual collegial chatter.  Gah.  I am an annoying person.  However, I do have high hopes that I may actually get writing done today, so I guess that's one good thing.  One thing that never happens when I'm working: I never have crazy freaky sex and then get told to take care.  I guess that's something.

      The contents of the top of my desk are as follows:  1.  Binder with tenure materials. 2.  Pile of plastic sheet protectors for said binder. 3.  "Stack" (if you can call a 6-inch layer that covers the entire desk a "stack) of random papers accumulated from last semester, including drafts of the fall's syllabi, student work that was never collected, attendance sheets, etc. 4.  Ooh, a library book I thought I had returned. 5.  In-class journals from my writing classes that were never picked up.  (Should I just rip out the pages that were written on and keep them for my own use?  Is that being cheap?)  I could go on but it's too depressing.  I sitting in the office wasting valuable time that could be spent A.  Poolside. B.  Writing. C.  Cleaning the above-described pit of a desk. D.  Shopping for new end-tables.  I am doing none of these things because I am a silly person in need of a Life Coach (as on Nip/Tuck - even though I don't think that's a real profession.... perhaps I should become a Life Coach of this whole college professor thing doesn't work out?  My former back-up was going to be beauty school, but I could possibly get some mileage out of my PhD if I went the Life Coach route....)  Still no word from Rhett.  Apparently he decided to leave town for a couple of weeks and not just one.  Also, apparently, he has spent at least one of these two weeks with his ex-girlfriend, fucking her brains out, because I performed that oh-so-essential operation of showing him that he really does still love her, she really is the most beautiful girl in the whole world, she is the smartest woman he's ever known, and she really is the best sex he's ever had.  (By the way, I have absolutely no evidence for the preceding claim, but if experience is any guide, this is EXACTLY what happened.  Why is it that men can't figure these things out without getting fun girls like me involved?  It's one of the great mysteries of the universe....)  Well, this is ridiculous (especially as I suspect that no one at all reads this blog, and it's just operating as an extension of my journal that I've been keeping since I was an adolescent.... and to think Candi and I had dreamed that we would become famous in the blogosphere - even if the thought did terrify us....  By the way, Candi's away doing the family visiting thing for the next couple of weeks, but you'll be happy to know that Sam is busy dicking her over in nearly the exact same fashion in which he dicked her over when they went out the first time.  As I said, relationships are great for procrastinating....)

      I've spent the past few hours chatting with colleagues, reading the internet, thinking about living room furniture, and printing out a plethora of journal articles, and somehow, unaccountably, the depression and angst of my earlier post appears to have passed.  This is good news, as I've been in such a funk for the past couple of days that I haven't been able to write, and I really need to write in order for my summer not to have been a complete waste.  Additionally, this exit from the funk is good because it means that I've effectively managed to replace my ruminations about Rhett-Who-Does-Not-Love-Me with ruminations about scholarly productivity, which is definitely a step in the right direction.  You might be asking yourself: why has Tiffani convinced herself that the whole thing with Rhett was imaginary, when he's clearly still out of town and she has no evidence to support this judgment?  Well, I think it's been the pragmatic choice, as I would never get a lick of work done without putting that fucker out of my head.  Also, I do think it's rude that he never mentioned the dates he'd be out of town, effectively making me into a Waiting Woman, which I do not like.  Thus, I'm kind of pissed off at him, even though there is no rational explanation for this.  Academia is a solitary world, and I think I had let myself fantasize that in Rhett I would perhaps have someone with whom to share that solitude.  This was ridiculous, and I now realize that if anything is to transpire with Rhett it doesn't necessarily mean that I will have someone to inspire my work.  In fact, I think that it's probably a mistake for one to let her work depend on any relationship, as relationships are fleeting or at least unreliable.  In fact, relationships are the ultimate procrastination technique, with fucking only coming in a far second. Perhaps this is why female academics with husbands and children achieve promotion/tenure so much more slowly than their male counterparts?

      For a variety of reasons, most of which have to do with the fact that I am a big loser.  Item #1 I need to be writing/reading and am not.  Item #2 It turns out that the entire "relationship" with Rhett was in my head, as I have not heard a peep from him, and I regret a. sending him a postcard from Ireland, b. leaving a message for him upon my return, and not to mention c. having crazy sex with him when clearly he doesn't really care about me one way or another.  Item #3 Fox is in Cali, and I suspect I will never fuck him.  Item #4 I am not a very amazing academic, in spite of my efforts.  On top of this, I think I'll need to go on the market this year, just to see what's out there, but I fear nobody will recommend me.  I hate everything in the whole world, but, most of all, myself.  Academe + PMS = Doom + Gloom

      There isn't much to report these days, as Rhett is out of town, Fox is defending his dissertation on Monday and so is no fun, and I have absolutely no holiday weekend plans, other than to lay in the sun (which, yes, causes cancer, but also causes a glorious golden - and not orange - suntan) and to feel sorry for myself.    The main problem in my life right now is indicated by the title of this post: I am a Tiffani divided.  All of the parts of my life have separated from one another, and this means that I have to watch what I say in all manner of situations.  Example 1: I went to dinner with colleagues last night and I had to gloss over 90% of my trip when telling them about it because I couldn't let them think that I had any sort of relations with Lancelot as it might get back to Rhett, whom I don't want to bother with the details of that relationship.  Example 2: I can't talk about Lancelot or Rhett if I'm on the phone on my balcony, as Fox might come out onto his balcony and find out that I am a big whore.  Example 3:  I can't invite Rhett over to my house until Fox moves away because I think Rhett would be bothered if he knew about my making out with Fox or if he suspected some sort of intimacy between us.  Similarly, I don't really want Fox to know about Rhett, as it's not really any of his business that I've got a suitor.  Candi thinks that my chances of fucking Fox would be greater if he knew that I had another suitor, but this doesn't sit well with me for some reason.  Since all of this is the case, I suspect I should focus on work and refuse to be distracted and boy-crazy.  This is difficult, as working makes me want to scratch my eyes out.  Next week: look for angry posts about the futility of revising ones dissertation into a book manuscript.
