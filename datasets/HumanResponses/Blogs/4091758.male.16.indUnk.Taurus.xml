      So here I am in San Jose at a tech forum which is cool. I have xanga but I've never used this and thought I would try it.

      So I leave tomorrow, awesomeness. As for then I will not touch my normal xanga, I will write here. I lost it, a stupid piece of paper with my name and picture on it and you would have thought it was the end of the world if you were here yesterday. For the second day in a row I felt physically ill even though I knew I was fine, I thought I was going to throw up (the other day being 2 days ago after being asked about boys twice, I hate that my grandma's friends not knowing, but I dont know if she would be mad if she told. It becomes too much sometimes though, always lying through my teeth...it sucks) and I just laid on the floor trying to keep myself calm. I honestly don't know where it went...that is what bothers me so much. I didn't know it was gone but they keep saying I do. I'm sorry but some piece of paper wasn't on my mind. If it was in my room (which I honestly, whole heartedly, would tell Oniichan to her face (and I would never lie to her) don't think it was) it probably got lost in the big cleanup. Funny thing, if my room were still a mess things might be fine. I wanted to see Monica, but I didn't get to, which sucks I actually cried when she left I didn't want her to go and I wanted to say goodbye so bad. I cried about it last night...ya I'm lame I know. Oniichan is picking me up when I get home which makes me a super happy Sami, even happier that it was her idea ^_^ Well, take care all, and hope that some lame baby doesnt throw up on me (my dad told me about it...ughhhh...my liking for babies/little kids has died very quickly in the last year or so and that didnt help lol) ~Sami

      I found a safety pin! Hehe, just thought I would mention that.I got hit on in the elevator going to breakfast -_- how annoying is that. Anyway just went out and found another one of the Starbucks around hehe, yay. It's kinda cold right now though.So first we went to see this speaker this last night who was talking about using biology to make new technology (Dr.Full was his name I believe) it was actually really interesting and entertaining. Then we had a tech talk meeting...there are only 3 girls in my group and from what I heard that is how all the other groups are. We had fun though there is one other person from San Diego there. Lots of Texans too, hm. Anyway today we have a speaker from Nasa, site visits, and seminars wow. If I can I'll drop a line at dinner but I need to email Oniichan and she comes first :p I wish she were here should would like this a lot. My bed has 4 pillows lol I got buried in them last night. I went to breakfast this morning it will pretty good, I like having to walk to everything sometime I want to check out the workout room it's on the same floor as my room. Well I'm going to go back to my room and read some stuff we have to read by tonight and I'll check in later~Sami

      Hi all!Just blowing time before my meeting at 7. Ok so I was majorly annoyed this morning. After the huge (and I mean huge) deal made about it the guy couldn't have cared less about my stupid card. He hardly looked at it! After all the stress that has come out of it I wanted him to atleast say something, but noo it didn't matter. That darn paper has made my last days at home very unpleasant I am sooooo happy to be here now. This place is hugeeee. My roommate is one of the few girls I met right after I got off the plane yay. There are more guys than girls here, blah. I didn't know we could leave the hotel but we have a BIG area outside of it where we are aloud to go which rocks. Had dinner at the Fairmont it was good so I was happy lol. They have flat panel moniters here! I want one! *sob* I need safety pins, these shirts I got dont have top buttons ><><>

      Well lets see, first of all went to breakfast this morning and then had a tech talk meeting and started our future solutions projects which we will have this big science fair type thing for on the 2nd to last day and CEOs and such will come check us out.Then me and a bunch of friends went down to the Fairmont area and ate lunch. So then as I was walking back to my hotel this super cute chick w/ pink/blonde hair was walking near me and I was looking at her and I gues she noticed bc she started talking to me and we were going to the same talk so we went and when I got there I had to change my shoes so I rushed up to and after the talk we were going to go to Starbucks and I realized I had left my wallet upstairs...w/ my key in it -_-; So I called my roommate and she was like actually they have to change the battery on our key thing so even if you had your key you couldnt get in. Meh. So we went back to Katie's room at the Fairmont but ugh...I was in my dressshoes and I had a blister and that sucked. Their hotel is huge I dont know how she didnt get lost. They only have one bed in their rooms though we have 2. So she changed and I now realize I left my notebook on her bed so Im gonna have to go back there tomorrow and get it I cant now she went out somewhere. She has a boyfriend though...blahness bc she was totally cute. So after we went to Starbucks we met up with a guy she knew and went to the game store. While I was in there this guy came up to me and was like I love your necklace my boyfriend gave me the same one and I was like !!! cool! So then the 3 of us met some of my friends for dinner and after we ordered I went upstairs really quick to see if I could get into my room and there was an envelope on the door w/ my name on it and it had the new key in it so I was happy I went and got my wallet and changed my shoes. Dinner was yummy and then we had another tech talk meeting. So then we were going to this tech museum place and while waiting for the elevator I saw this guy and he had this tiny rainbow braclet and I commented on it and he was thrilled to find another one (both the guys were named Kyle too) so we were hanging out and he found his other gay friend and I found the one from before and we all hung out which was really cool. So now Im just emailing you and we are going to go hang out by the pool ^_^ Anyway thats all for today, more site visits/talks tomorrow so take care all~Sami

      So I already feel like Ive been here forever...in a good way. I've fallen int routine already and my friends are already starting to feel like family we were hanging out on the 2nd floor yesterday and it was so fun it will be sad when I have to leave. But hey, Ill be able to get off that plane and glomp Oniichan ^_^ so its not that bad, Im so glad she is the first one I see when I get home. I brought her perfume and my pen w/ her voice and my pink monkey hehe. Oh my gosh!!! Today when Microsoft talked to us they gave us a product preview of their media center...and I thought iPod rocked but this thing surpasses it by far! It plays pictures, songs, video and it freaking rocked. I know a lot do that but you have to see it it so rocks. They aren't out yet though and I prolly won't ever get one bc they prolly cost an arm and a leg *sob* So they changed the lock on my door bc the keys didnt work anymore. These really freakin annoying prank callers called 3 times last night after midnight and my roommate was so pissed she yanked all the wires out of the phone and it didnt bother us then. So I woke up late -_- and missed breakfast, as did most of my tech talk group. After that we had the Microsoft talk...Mac didnt even come up but there was a lot of Windows vs. Linux arguments and someone asked if we would get an apology letter for Windows ME and Longhorn (the new windows OS that isn't out yet) came up a few times too. Then lunch yay! I was so hungry lol. So I'm in the Fairmont now, got my notebook back from Katie and am hanging with my fellow rainbow warriors (I saw someone with a shirt like that once I loved it.) until we have to leave for our site visits. We go to San Fran. this weekend yay. We actually go twice dont remember when the other day is. I saw it from far away the other day but thats it. We've been downloading Big Brother off of Bittorrent lol there are TONS of laptops here I feel like a minority lol what else is new :p So Im gonna have to show you pictures of what the elevator cramming looks like...lol. Checked out the pool yesterday which was cool didnt go in though (would that turn my hair green? Hrm. My body isnt exactly bathing suit ready anyway lol) Oniichan emailed me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so happy that so made my day lol. Well Ill write more later when I get back SanDisc. Then my friends and I are going to Starbucks around dinner time, back to tech talk meeting then getting pizza yay lol. We were going to yesterday but it was past delivery time and we werent all that hungry. ~Sami-chan

       suppose wherever you go you cant escape the drama that comes with throwing a bunch of teens who had never met together. Especially when there are 90% guys and 10% girls. I suppose every girl has atleast one guy trying to get to her, the guys here seem more woman hungry than anything else. I've got one going after me...and in all honesty he seemed like a cool friend until he started trying to impress me thinking he was cool bc he snuck out and did prank calls. He is making the whole group feel odd and then last night on msn he was like ya I like you (it was obvious) and Im like *sigh*. He got busted for the calls though. Last night we were waiting for pizza and Tamara (our tech talk leader) came back and we told her how lucky we were to have such a cool leader she seemed to really appreciate that. She is awesome, somehow I always get the good teachers. I had More(Oniichan!), Simmons, Edingfield, Siegel...ect ect and feel quite lucky for that. So today we met Kevin Mitnick which was super awesome, he got two standing ovations. He told us a bunch of cool hacking stories ^_^. Had lunch at Quiznos yummyness they gave us coupons ^_^ our name badges give us discounts. Last night at open mic I saw Katie which was really cool ^_^ and our pizza was very good. My this is randomly written and not organized...oh well. During tech talk last night I got to talk to mom and dad which was cool. I got to talk to my friend Kris from english 3rd period too (I switched out of 3rd 2nd semester so I could keep my APCP teacher) My friend Justin is moving to this nowhere place called Hemmit which sucks. There goes my queerboy counterpart =( So we have seminars this afternoon and curfew is extended till midnight tonight yay. I didnt miss breakfast today either. Before bed lastnight we unplugged both phones but at 2am someone text msged me and woke me up then it was hot so I went to go turn the AC on and it was dark so when I tried to go to bed I missed and hit the floor ha ha I was laughing so hard. Well thats all for now, take care all~Sami
