      I love VH1's I Love the [insert decade] show...it's such a time filler. Anyway, last night Adam, Kevin, Vincent, and Mark came over. WE chilled. We attacked mark with the laser pointer. mark and kevin left. Vincent adn Adam stayed til 4 AM. Then we dropped off Vincent and Adam and me came back to my house and he slept over. Now, where does the smuttiness start? Well, after adam left I took the most horrific shit of my life. How bad? It was a three-pronged attack. 4 bathrooms in my house; I used 3 of them to distribute the rancidness. No one bathroom could handle it all. That's the last time I eat pizza, popcorn, and an assortment of nuts and seeds at 4 AM.   -Suicide Smutter

      I am so pissed off right now. It's not the "Look, Kevin's getting pissed haha" type of pissed off, it's the type of pissed off where you want to put your fist through walls and scream at the top of your lungs.  My parents picked up my car from the mechanic earlier today while I was still sleeping. The mechanic was lucky I didn't come down there to pick it up, because the same two hands that are typing this blog would have been around his neck when he presented the bill. The bill, I care not to discuss, but the car is fixed and the mechanic can take the money, go on a cruise, and shove it up his ass.  I really don't know how much worse it can get. The whole winter break has been a nightmare so far. I'm starting to feel like I'm losing touch with some of my friends, and then on top of that this whole car bullshit happens. Albany, I miss you so much!!!  On a lighter note, happy new year to everyone!!! We can only hope for better luck in 2004.  -BIGsmut.

      I have only one thing to say. Fuck this town and the liars and scumbags in it. Also real friends don't give up, never for no reason. You know who you are.

      I was just talking to a few people and I'd like to ask: what the FUCK is up with all this coke shit going around? I don't know what's rumors or what's true, but it's fucking pathetic. There were so many cokeheads last year in the graduating class, and they were all pricks, so fuck each and every one of them. But it's so disappointing to see people, many of which are good friends of mine, go down the same path. Please, snap out of it, and GROW UP!!!  I really, really miss the innocent days of middle school when everyone got along so well.....  :::shakes head and walks away:::

      Somehow rolled out of bed at 6:45AM this morning (Tuesday) and dragged myself to work. Ughhhhhhhh!!! Brian and I were the only two who showed up today, no surprise there. Work was cake today, we refinished one small gym in Putnam County and were home by noon. The head custodian there was mad cool and entertained us with Desert Shield war stories while we worked. Brian and I shared some infamous college stories. He graduated from SUNY Oswego last year and assures me that college is going to be the best four years ever. My one semester in Albany has already been great, I can't wait to go back up for spring semester - this lame winter break needs to hurry the fuck up and end!!!  After work I dropped my fuel-leaking ghetto wagon off at the shop. Looks like it's going to be a few days until it gets fixed. Now my parents are offering to pay half of whatever it's going to cost to get it repaired. Seems fair to me, since they used the car for over a decade before I ever got to drive it. However it's still going to be a huge burden on my savings. I hope Tom has more work for me next week. $$$...woot woot!!!  Chris picked me up tonight along with Nick and Adam. Highlights include going to McDonald's and going around the drive-thru four times -- one time for each person because we were too lazy to pay all at once! The third or fourth time around the drive-thru the cashier looked puzzled, and Big C hooked us up with MAD food. For some odd reason he gave us about 15 honey mustard packets, most of which I threw at road signs on the way home. We also yelled at a deer walking in the middle of Central Highway. Deer are very stupid animals -- too bad I didn't have any honey mustard packets left to throw at it. :::evil grin:::  New Year's Eve is shaping up to be a blast!!! I don't plan on drinking myself until I black out like I did last year, but I'm going to drink enough so that my liver will be cursing me the next morning. My college-burdened liver got a break for a while but naptime is over, bitch!  -BIGsmut.

      WOW the blog has really taken off.  Hope it keeps going, tomorrow is New Years Eve cant wait to drink myself into a coma.  Hopefully everything goes to plan and their is a place to go.  My biggest problem for now is decided what beer to get for tomorrow, I've narrowed it down to two finalists.  1st is my all time favorite beer Rolling Rock, then I could aways go crazy and buy Heinei's but the question is do i want to shell out to money.  Better sleep on it in order to make the right decision.  I'll leave with a tribute to a wounded soldier                       --"In Heaven Everythings Allright"--   [KakaSMUT]

      My advice to everyone: do not light a match anywhere near my car, or else you will die a firey death. Why? My car is leaking gas now, and the ominous puddle of gas laying under the car is pretty much proof that I'm going to have to replace the fuel tank. I filled the tank last night so the leak must be near the top of the tank. I wonder when I'm going to wake up from this nightmare...  Tom called this afternoon and asked if I was willing to work tomorrow. I graciously accepted the offer, as I need to make up for these costly car repairs. It's going to be interesting to see who else shows up for work tomorrow, considering everyone was fed up with the job by the end of last summer. Looks like we're headed over the bridge to some unknown place in Mahopac. God I hope we don't have to sand some big, dirty gym tomorrow.  Justin called me a few minutes ago asking if I wanted to go to Stiletto's tonight. I would have went in a split second but I had to turn down the offer since I have to wake up at 7:30AM for work tomorrow.  I took a sleeping pill a little while ago since I know there was NO way I'm going to be able to go to sleep before midnight when I've been going to sleep at 4AM for the past week. Drowsiness is really starting to kick in now, I'm probably going to pass out in a little bit...  -BIGsmut.

      "Hey I remember that girl, she graduated a couple years ago." - Bob "She goes to St. Rose." - Reza "I'm going to St. Rose." - Bob "Not only does she have a beautiful ass, but she is also a nymph! She also has a boyfriend." - Reza "::thinks to himself::   i hate girls with boyfriends.. someone finish the quote.. get a cookie!" - Bob  Dec 27- I wake up early (12:30 PM) and take a shower and get dressed. I call Katie and then she comes over with a bunch of video games. We played FFX2, The Sims, SSX3, Harry Potter, and Tekken Tag. She whooped my ass in all the video games : (  I fell in love with one of the characters from X2, her name is Rikku. She is so hot. Hours later.... Adam picks me up in his new 2004 mini cooper and we pimp it all the way to the mall to meet everyone at chili's for dinner with the birthday girl. the wait for food was long, but amusing, it was my first meal of the day and was at around 9pm. but it was fun, dessert was good. Afterwards i had a smutty gathering. I smoked a bowl with Karen in the garage. and then me katie and karen smoked the bong while adam and nick watched. and then i smoked with whitney and colleen. i was retarded. i don't remember much after that .. i passed out on my bed and dreamt about a white monkey with a crusty belly button and some crazy zombie named Nosferatu? wtf  :-p  Dec 28- I wake up late (5 PM).. showered and ate food.. then xavier picked me up and we drove around. we picked more people up. we chilled at pat's for 20 mins and then went on a beer run. there wasn't enough room in the car so michael ferguson got put in the trunk. we got beer and then followed orlando to stont point. he made a U turn and sped away so we said fuck that jagoff. we drive around madison avenue and go fast because of this part in the road that makes the car jump. Terd, i mean mike ferguson almost died in the trunk. it was funny. we go to pats. i drink a 22 fast. i met this kid named Andrew who is a senior at UAlbany. we exchanged numbers so we could meet up and smoke. james walked in, i haven't seen james in a long time. james drives me back home to pick up bong. we go back to pats and i smoke with james, gill, and amanda. i also let joe, andrew, evan, and george take a hit. then i whip out the bowl and me and james smoke more. i then drink another 22. andrew walks in and drives me to wendy's. i need fucking sauce with my nuggets so we drive thru mcdumpster for sauce. the lovely spanish ladies once again pull through and hook us up with food. we bring it back to pats. i eat it all. the party then gets real big. pat's brother kicks people out . me and drew drive around and sell bags. we drive back to wendy's and meet colleen, whitney, and brianne. i ordered cheese fries. we chat and throw food at each other. we then drive to dan griffin's house. we had many treats, i got a special treat. we end up back at pat's house. at that point i am so blasted that i don't know what's going on. andrew drives me home. i am here now mellowing out to music. katie decides she wants to do something crazy and sneaks out of her house. her brother goes on her screen name looking for her. he asks me a bunch of questions and wants them answered immediately. Katie didn't get in much trouble : )  I'm going to mellow out to some Incubus and then call it a night.. tomorrow.. uh later today i mean i have to do something i've wanted to do for a long time... buy clothes.. my worth as a human being depends on it!

      "Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the girls are pretty..." Take me away from here!  For a lack of better words, today blew ass - what's new? Another failed attempt at going bowling because the bowling alley closes at 10:00 on Sunday night. Another bad day for my car: it sounds like the muffler is going to fall off at any time now, and the exhaust fumes seem to be leaking into the car because it STINKS. I'm taking it to the mechanic this week to end this bullshit. The grand total is going to be at least $1,000......FUCKSHITBITCHCUNTCOCKSUCKERMOTHERFUCKER!!!!!!!!!! Whew.  I got a huge headache from driving around tonight. I don't know if it was the loud roaring sound that was giving me the headache, or if it was the carbon monoxide from my broken exhaust system/leaking fuel tank. Whatever it was, it was getting me worried so I had to drop everyone off pretty early. Sorry guys!!!  I'm sick of the BULLSHIT EXCUSES people make when they want to get out of doing something. I may be a big doofus, but I ain't stupid.. It really makes me question who my friends really are. :(  Finally got my Fall semester grades from UAlbany. Four A's and one C+. Two words: FUCK PHYSICS!  Couldn't sleep last night. Way too many crazy thoughts going through my head:  *If you travel into space at the speed of light for 10 years, and then return to Earth at the speed of light for another 10 years, you will be 20 years older, but the Earth will be 460 years older. This is actually true; we calculated it in Physics lecture using relativity formulas. Too bad it's not humanly possible to do this. *In Alaska, there are 24 hours of darkness on the first day of winter and 24 hours of daylight on the first day of summer. I remember watching the Alaska episode of Insomniac w/ Dave Attell. They were drinking outside at midnight and it was sunny. That's gotta be an experience.  Haha, I feel better already. That's what's so great about this blog, it's a nice place to vent your feelings and get the troubles off your mind instead of drinking them away or smoking yourself so stupid that you don't even know what the word "problem" means. :)  -BIGsmut.

      I've come to the realization that I will not participate in this blog as a written journal for others to see.  I don't know exactly what I will use this blog for, when I do decide to write in it.  But the purpose of this blog for me now, is to inform you of that decision.  Think about out it, do you really want to reveal every nit-pick of your life to others, so that they can form assumptions about you; assumptions which you would not find true to your own identity?  The less you expose yourself to others, the more mysterious you become.  Which means, you can hand-pick the people with which you choose to share your life.  It is a natural filtering system, that blogger.com graciously steals and spits upon, and feeds your mind with fallacies allowing you to think that you're keeping a "journal".  Subconciously, people understand this..  They understand that many of their peers will undoubtedly skim through their bloggers, enabling them access to personal experiences...  Yet, instead one's subconcious mind will just keep revealing and revealing, until they're numb to the fact that others are making judgements and assumptions, until one reaches the point where he/she simply goes overboard with what they're saying about himself/herself.  You only have one life, once you allow others to absorb knowledge about you into their minds, it has the potential to remain there forever.  Shadiness is "god's" gift to you, use it wisely.  You might be saying to yourself that it is hypocritical of me, the author, to reveal knowledge about my views to the reader.. But I'm trying to do a favor for the people, and I'll take my chances with just this bit of information.  You see, I find an exhiliration (maybe not to that extent) in sparking thought into others...  It's just the kind of person I am.  I hope I got you thinking, I apologize for bringing these pessimistic views to the blog.  Well..  I've revealed to much, I'll be on my way.

      "Get that crazy ass mother off your skull. Go to the barber. Tell the barber you're sick of looking like an asshole. CUT THE MULLET!" -Wesley Willis  Today's wakeup time: 3:00PM. Haha, it's getting later and later!  Went to the mall today with Chris, Ed, and Dan. We had absolutely no reason to go there except to fuck with the innocent public. Chris really caused a ruckus this time. He's good at it because he knows how to keep a straight face in any situation, so people never know if he's kidding or not.  After the mall we all chilled at Ed's house for a little while. We chilled with Ed's cousin, she was cool. Ed's dogs are mad funny. His golden retriever is so bad that they're forced to keep it in the bathroom for the fear that it will destroy every piece of furniture in the house. Even in the bathroom it manages to chew the toilet flusher knob. LOL.  Justin just showed me some revealing pictures of Britney Spears from a recent photo shoot. Man, she is so FUCKING hot. She might as well just take off all her clothes since she pretty much wears nothing during her photo sessions anyway. "Imagine one night with her." :)  -BIGsmut.

      Ello ladies n gents, Lord of the Smuts/Smutzilla/Sir Smuts-a-lot here..  So far this blog has been "ok", which is why I'm here to add some humor.  Let me first start by not telling you how I've spent my last few days, but rather, just interesting events in my past, and plans for the future.  Well one interesting experience in the past that I can pretty much only think of right now, is how when I was visiting my friend titled "Yo Quiero Smut" up in the north, we saw some pretty strange things.  "Yo Quiero Smut" (YQS) and myself were driving around town when we saw an open field, with two policemen in uniform relaxing and playing frisbee.  Now, that was a little strange if you ask me, but YQS and myself just shrugged it off.  We soon encountered railroad tracks laid out behind trees on the side of the road, and an African-American family sadly walking on it (faces downward), mother, father, son, daughter, and all.  Finally, we visited the local Kohl's for no specific reason, and YQS and myself were surprised to see manakins sitting on wheelchairs used to display their clothes.  Now sure, maybe they wanted to diversfy their manakins by making sure they don't all look the same.. But on a wheelchair! what's that all about?  Anywho, enough of that.  I'm pretty much done here, I'm going to do some secretive things.  But before I go, let me just list some words that describe my interests:  crows, cats, ninjas, owls, sharks, manitees, orcas, tom cruise in the last samurai, philosophy, mimes, daniel day lewis, people with the middle name "rose", arnold schwartzenegger, the wb 11 morning news, ford taurai, yahoo pool, bubble trouble, rap, gameboy advanced sp, warmth, crows, samurais, lingo, the accelerator, roller coasters, spiderman at sharper image...  Alright, I'm out: please do not negatively criticize my hair, I'm getting it cut Tuesday, but not short.

      Edge171 (1:06:42 AM): this town sucks Mest84 (1:07:43 AM): it sucks a male camel's dick with Price Chopper imitation vanilla extract  Damn right. Woke up at 2:30PM today to face the challenge of setting up my wireless router. I almost had to have computer-guru Bob stop by and help me out with it, but I somehow managed to get it to work. Now I have my own computer, and internet access anywhere in my house, including the deck and backyard if you REALLY want to go hardcore.  My computer's temporary layout really blows. It's set up on my tiny-ass nightstand next to my bed. In order to have it all fit on there, I had to switch my HUGE monitor with the thin, more manageable flatscreen monitor that my family was using with their computer. My brother was PISSED when he saw that I switched the monitors, but I think he's over it because I set him up with Counter-Strike. My parents offered to go to Ikea and buy a computer table for me sometime soon, so hopefully I won't be using this god damn nightstand forever!  Earlier tonight, Bob brought up the idea of everyone going Moonlight Bowling, so I went to pick up Adam. As my car pulled up his driveway, I noticed smoke coming from the hood. Great! I frantically shut the car off and open the hood. It smelled of burnt rubber, but I was unable to locate the source of the smoke, as it was windy on the mountain. There were no more problems with the K-Wagon for the rest of the night, despite the thing roars like a "Spivic" from needing a new exhaust.  Me and Adam met up with Bob, Lauren, Jacquie, Jena, Chris, and Lauren's cousin at Bob's house. They were all listening to hypnotic music, eating, and staring at funky Winamp visualizations. Looks like Bob's new bong had some action tonight, heh. We got to the bowling alley at 11:25 and the fucking faggot at the front desk tells us that Moonlight Bowling is on Saturday, and the bowling alley closes in 5 minutes. Fuck! So we drove to Blockbuster, watched Lord Of The Rings at Bob's for a little while (I do NOT understand that movie), and went home shortly after. Jammed to Guns N' Roses "Paradise City" while driving back.  Here I am again, on my computer. As I glance over at my TV screen, I see that some fool wrote the words "Clean Me" in the dust. Thanks for the reminder, asshole.  -BIGsmut.

      I think all thinks...including alcohol are bad. I prefer mary jane to alcohol because I think that beer tastes like jet fuel...I'm not a fan. I prefer puffin the magic dragon. However, I gotta stop doing that so often...its not good. From this day on, I will only do it MAXIMUM once a week (right now I'm at 3 a week on average for the last 3 weeks). You know what's really smutty...bob's famous quote, "I hate girls with boyfriends...there's no use in talking to them!" Seriously...there is no use in talknig to them. I stop.

      Hey everyone. This is Bryan aka Solid Smut, BGB, BK, ______, dickface, and whatever other obcene words you can think of. I've been called it all. So, this is my first post and I'd like to start out by giving a mission statement. My mission in writing in this blog is to keep the public entertained. If I wanted to tell the whole world exactly what I was feeling at all times I wouldn't need a private journal. I'm sure no one wants to know how I'm feeling about stupid shit anyway.   On to the entertainment...  Haha, really I have nothing much to say at this time. All I can really think of is that drugs are really bad for you. Anything that distorts your perception and harms your body at the same time can't be good at all. I'm sure all of you are thinking now, "Bryan, you're such a hypocrite, I've seen you drinking at dozens of occasions. I've even seen you smoking a couple of times." I am not saying that I do not do this things. All I'm saying is that they can't be too good. I really don't enjoy smoking, even if I'm surrounded by all my closest friends. I just feel tired and my feeling of touch is greatly enhanced. Like I was in the shower last time and I pretty much feel asleep standing up in the shower thinking to myself, "this feels SOOOO weird!" I'm glad that I never really smoked on a constant basis or I'd turn out to be a snow bunny like so many other people I know. Drinking is fun. As long as you don't go overboard and you know your limit and you don't drink everyday, it's fun.  I'm gonna go pass out because I had a full day of practice (swimming)630-4. Bullshit

      Yo! How all you kids doing? Life has been getting better these past couple of days. Of course the fact that I wake up at 5:50 (this is AM before the sun comes up, don't be mistaken) every day really sux balls, but there have been other things that make up for this horrible task. First of all, we don't have school for two weeks. Second of all, I love girls. I love their smell, the way they talk, the way they walk, the way they try to be funny, the way they kiss, EVERYTHING! In all my years, I have never been able to just hangout with a girl and enjoy being there. It doesn't even have to be just me and the certain girl. This certain girl's father can be sleeping on the couch next to me, staring at her daughter holding some kids hand(mine), and I'm still having a good time. The reason for my enjoyment is that I'm there with the girl. Nothing else matters. I sound like an idiot. lol.  Bigah! Slap me. I can't wait for New Years.

      well, today is a new day, but everything stays the same. the only thing is, its getting colder. i wish i was somewhere hot with a beach.  -Sit down and shut up, you big, bald fuck. I don't like leaving my country Doug, and I especially don't like leaving it for anything less then sandy beaches, and cocktails with little straw hats!  I love it. everyone go out and buy the movie Snatch.  the weekend is soon so maybe something exciting will happen. I'll write back!

      Yeah. So the thing about New Years is it only happens once a year. We're probably better off for this fact. I don't know about anyone else, but mine was pretty crappy. That doesn't mean that I didn't have a good time because that would just be untrue. I did have a good time, overall, but there were a few points in the night that I could have used without. I don't really want to say anything about what happened because the two occurences that I'm talking about are pretty sensative areas. Let me just say that I don't regret the 3 hours I spent in that state of pissed-offness because I think that it helped. At least I hope it did. The other 15 minutes I'm talking about were just personal tough times because I'm a mental case and a romantic. Now I'm just ranting, but it's all good. This year better not suck. As of now, there have not been any smutty activities in my life except that time that I wore a girls bathingsuit and swam pretty slow.

      Everyone go check out www.grouphug.us ..... im fucking telling you it's uber smutty. Here, for example...  I have a huge zit that keeps coming back near my penis. It gets quite big, and then as soon as I can, I squeeze all the pus out.  Then it goes away for three or four months and comes back. I tell women that it's just an ingrown hair from when I shaved.  I would see a doctor about it, but honestly I really like squeezing the pus out of it.  That's like super sick.   Go now.. laugh your ass off

      Lately I've been having trouble sleeping. Too many god damned things on my mind. I've had the craziest dreams/nightmares lately.. I wake up at 3 pm.. yes 3pm on Christmas day. Sweating.. because i had a fever or because i had a bad dream?  I have a thousand songs on random, why does this one have to come on. I think my computer hates me..  it always finds the perfect time to play the wrong song . It was one of those dreams where i get too close to someone only to have them pull away.   I change my shirt and get out of bed. Chris is home and everyone else is in the city with the relatives. I make a few phone calls wishing everyone a merry christmas and then i took a shower. get dressed.. mellow out to some music.. drink 4 beers. Being the light weight that i am 4 beers on an empty stomach gave me a good buzz. chat with people online. play a lot of max payne 2. andrew walked over here at around 9 and was backseat driver for an hour of max payne 2. parents came home with food and gifts from the city. the most interesting gift i got was my bong.  Hopefully this bong won't distract me too much upstate. I've already promised to myself that next semester i will stay away from all the distractions up there (beer, sex, and drugs) or at least hold them off until the weekend. Lately i've been getting angry at myself for doing some of the stupid shit i do because in the end it isn't worth it.   Ok.. I've probably already lost you because i jump around a lot when i tell stories, i'll try to put all those sililoquies in italics, but i'll probably get lazy and just say fuck it. Ok after drew watches an hour of Max Payne 2, Lauren comes over and then we call Reza to see if he wants to chill and bring over Lord Of the Rings. He doesn't pick up and doesn't call back. Katie never called for our Final Fantasy date either.. so hmm bored. We drive to Andrew's house to pick up LOTR the Fellowship and then to lauren's to pick up a homemade apple pie. After that i drove to north garnerville parking lot this song is totally appropriate right now christmas is over. i gotta stop smoking i gotta find a new hobby. maybe reading books? how about studying? i'm sorry i'm just mouthing off.. me and lauren smoked a bowl next to the playground while andrew watched. it was cold and windy out and my throat was not ready for it.. i coughed. i cough 10% of the time, i like to think i'm a pro. i need to go to the gym. i'm so out of shape. it's not even that.. after i workout i'm in a better state of mind. i can sit here and listen to music for hours. i think my cold is almost gone. i need to go out on a date i think that would make me feel better. i just noticed that i'm typing completely random things, but it's what exactly is on my mind. i think about random things. i used to have such an imagination. two nights ago katie told me this beautiful story about her dream of california and how i visit there and get with this blonde chick with brown eyes and she teaches me how to surf! hopefully by then i'll be a better swimmer. the point of the story is that i lost my sense of imagination.. like i used to sit in class or just sit there back in the day and have the craziest fantasies.. maybe reality hit me? is this real? what am i doing sitting here? i want to do something, i want to make something. i don't want to sit here anymore and do nothing. in fact i'm tired of partying. i want to do something totally different. I want to go skydiving, scuba diving, street racing, flying, mountain climbing. i want to be outside i want to be on the beach, i want to play frisbee. i want to be enlightened. i want to feel alive again.  me andrew and lauren watch lotr and i eat a lot of snack foods. i drive lauren and drew home and now here i am. i think i'm done mouthing off for tonight i'm not even going to proof read or spell check. winamp 5 is evil. it plays the songs you DON'T WANT TO HEAR. Forget December. Fuck December. Fuck you.

      Yo! A blog just for Team [SMUT]? Oh boy, this should be interesting. I see you guys wasted no time talking about shitting and farting. Heh. Props go out to Bob for setting this thing up for us!!!  Today was Christmas Day and I rolled out of bed at the crack of dawn (coughcough2PMcoughcough) as usual. Dinner...errrr I mean breakfast...was already being cooked. I gave my parents a $50 gift certificate to the Outback. I think my dad seemed pretty thrilled by the thought of free food. My mom comes up to me and tells me that I she got me a new car. I almost hit the floor when I heard that, but disappointment soon followed when she hands me a stupid fucking piece of chocolate resembling a car. What the fuck!!!  However, my parents were nice enough to buy me a wireless router so I can hook my own computer up in my room. That means my little brother can jerk off all he wants using the family computer, and I don't have to touch the mouse and keyboard anymore! Woot! I tried setting up the router earlier today but I found out that I'm missing an ethernet wire. That means I'm off to Radioshack first thing tomorrow...  Oh yeah, one more thing. Tuesday night everyone got super blazed off of Bob's brand new bong. When I went home blazed off my ass, I was convinced that all the appliances in the house were watching my every move. I laid on my bed in terror, staring at my TV set and satellite reciever. It was definately the worst trip I've ever had, ever. Don't smoke pot, kids!  -BIGsmut.

It came right away, all in one log, quickly and quietly. Then I move on to wiping... NOTHING AT ALL. IT WAS GREAT. ALL IN ALL I PROBABLY SPENT 2 MINUTES IN THERE. If i was with a girl I could've passed it off as a fucking piss. Heaven i tell you, heaven

      5 more months...just 5 more..I'm about to go to the mall to buy some clothing...yesterday at lunch an entire table of 10th grade girls decided to give me the "look" (because of my "eckert" post on this blog)  so I made fun of them which is fun...I don't think they realize how everyone in the 12th grade enjoys mocking them. Ohhh well.  Alright...I'm thinking SMUT dinner tonight but I have a feeling it won't pan out...I'll try to organize. I'll call people.

      whats good my fellow [SMUT]s... i hope all of you had great success either in the high school midterms or the semester finals. Now that the hard shit is over, i say we all go out an enjoy the fruits of our labor, aka go out and be sociable. ive been doing my part in the "go out when bob is not here" department, where is everyone else? This weekend, everyone better have a story to tell about how awsome there saturday night was, or how they had such an awsome time watchin the superbowl. If you dont go out becuase you chose not to, well thats another story, but remember, a hermit crab can only move into a bigger shell by going out and getting it (whatever that means, i just made it up)  Make [SMUT] proud Darin P.S. By going out i dont mean waste all your money on alcohol or drugs, especially if your not into that. hanging out with your friends and doing fun stuff is just as cool.

       I turned down free weed for the first time in my life!   In fact I am not smoking or drinking on weeknights anymore because i have to get my GPA up. And not for just that reason. It's not healthy mentally and physically. Plus if i only smoke and/or drink on the weekend i won't have as much of a tolerance, so i'm really looking forward to getting fukked up this weekend and every weekend!   What's this!? an official SMUT gathering without the leadership of Bob.. guys make it happen!!!   Have a SMUTTY day!  - R w L super SMUT

      The following is the guy code. Bob, I think we should make these requirements for being in SMUT...   1. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off limits forever! Unless you actually marry her.   2. When questioned by a friend's girlfriend, you need not and should not provide any information as to his whereabouts. You are even permitted to deny his very existence.   3. Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a friend out of jail within 24 hours.   4. A best man's toast may not include any of the following phrases, "down in Tijuana", "one time when we were all piss drunk", or "and this girl had the biggest rack you ever saw".   5. You may exaggerate any anecdote told to your friends by 50% without recrimination, beyond that anyone within earshot is allowed to yell out "bullshit!". (exception: when trying to pick up a girl, the allowable exaggeration is 400%)   6. Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.   7. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for another man is 5 minutes. The maximum is 6 minutes. For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale.   8. Bitching about the brand of free beverages in your buddy's refrigerator is forbidden. But gripe at will if the temperature is not suitable.   9. A friend must be permitted to borrow anything you own - grill, car, firstborn child - within 12 hr notice. Women or anything considered "lucky" are not applicable in this case.   10. Falling on a grenade for a buddy (agreeing to distract the skanky friend of the hot babe he's trying to score) is your legal duty. But should you get carried away with your good deed and end up getting on the beast, your pal is forbidden to ever speak of it.   11. Do not torpedo single friends.   12. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops, not the weakest.   13. Before dating a buddy's ex you are required to ask his permission. If he grants it, he is however allowed to say, "man, your gonna love the way she licks your balls"   14. Women who claim they "love to watch sports" must be treated as spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a Buffalo wing clean.   15. If a mans zipper is down, that’s his problem, you didn’t see anything!   16. No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for another man. (in fact, even remembering your best friends birthday is optional)   17. You must offer heartfelt condolences over the death of a girlfriends cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire and threw it into a ceiling fan.   18. While your girlfriend must bond with your buddies girlfriends with in 30 minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make nice with her gal pal's boyfriends- low level sports bonding is all the law requires.   19. Unless you have a lucrative endorsement contract, do not appear in public wearing more than one Nike swoosh.   20. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you may always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing.   21. If your girlfriend asks to set your friend up with her ugly, whiny, loser friend of hers, you must grant permission, but only if you have ample time to warn your friend to prepare his excuse about joining the priesthood.   22. Only in a situation of mortal danger or ass peril are you permitted to kick another member of the male species in the testicles.   23. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked. This includes men who aren't wearing shirts. If your buddy is outnumbered outmanned, or too drunk to defend himself, you must jump into the fight. Exception: if during the past 24 hours your friends actions have caused you to think "what this guy needs is a good ass wuppin", in which case you may refrain from getting involved and stand back and enjoy.   24. Friends don’t let friends wear speedos. Ever. Case closed.   25. Fives must be called at all times when getting out of your seat. If not, your seat is up for grabs. However, "house rules" may come into effect, in which case it is left up to the owner of the seat.   26. Shotgun can be called on anything where a shotgun applies., as long as you are in eyesight of the object, or it is at a reasonable time.   27. When picking players for sports teams it is permissible to skip over your buddy in favor of better athletes- as long as you don’t let him be the last sorry son of a bitch standing on the sideline.   28. If you ever compliment a guy's six pack, you better be talking about his choice of beverage.   29. Never join your girlfriend in ragging on a buddy of yours, unless she is withholding sex, pending your response.   30. Phrases that may never be uttered to another man while lifting weights: "Yeah, baby, push it!" "Come on, give me one more, harder!" "Another set and we can hit the showers" "Nice ass! Are you a Sagittarius?"   31. Never hesitate to reach for the last beverage or pizza, but not both. That’s just mean.   32. Never talk to another man in the bathroom unless you are on equal footing: both urinating, both waiting in line for all other situations an "I recognize you" nod will do just fine.   33. Never allow a telephone conversation with a woman to go on longer than you are able to have sex with her. Keep a stopwatch nearby, hang up if necessary.   34. You can not rat out a friend who show's up to work or class with a massive hangover, however you may: hide the aspirin, smear his chair with limburger cheese, turn the brightness on his computer way up so he thinks its broken, or have him paged every seven minutes.   35. If you catch your girl messing around with your best friend, let your states crime of passion laws be your guide.   36. If your buddy is trying to hook up with a girl, you may sabotage him only in a manor that gives you no chances of getting any either.   37. Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt one intervention. If he can get up on his feet, look you in the eye, and deliver a "fuck off" then you are absolved from all responsibility. Later on it is ok that you have no idea what his girlfriend is talking about.   38. The morning after you and a babe, who was formerly "just a friend", go at it, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is no reason not to jump on her again before there is a discussion about what a big mistake it was.   39. If a buddy has lint, an eyelash, or any other foreign object on his hair or face, under no circumstances are you permitted to remove it.

      what up playas   I just realized tonight as i went over to suffern high school that almost every person over there is arrogant. Along with this, thier parents still seem to be stuck in the 80's with thier names i.e. tate, lance, and some other name that is really 80's and real gay, something like boomer (which is a cool name for a dog but not a person). I seriously wish that for one day some suffern people would just come to our school and see what hardcore ghetto is like, what its like to actually have to be somewhat humble or else some black/spanish person will get in your face/kick your ass. GOD I HATE SUFFERN. GO TZ, GO NR, GO CLARKSTOWN... BEAT SUFFERN

      What's good? Big Smut reporting live from the Albany, NY where the legal drinking age is 12.  Today I looked over my transcript and found out that my 3 SUPA Economics credits from Syracuse University transferred!!! I had a 4.0 in that class, boosting my current cumulative GPA up to 3.70! Mr. Galati is the man for offering that class!!!  Upon finding this out, I immediately dropped Macroeconomics from my schedule and replaced it with Intro To Logic, which will fulfill my Gen Ed requirement in Humanities. Here's a look at my current schedule:   ACHM 120N (General Chemistry I)  Mon,Wed,Fri 2:30PM-3:50PM  ACHM 122A (General Chemistry Laboratory I)  Mon 1:00PM-4:00PM  AMAT 113 (Calculus II)  Mon,Wed,Thurs,Fri 3:35PM-4:30PM  APHI 210L (Introduction To Logic)  Tues,Thurs 11:15AM-12:35PM  APHY 150N (Physics II: Electromagnetism)  Tues,Thurs 9:45AM-11:05AM  UUNL 205 (Information Literacy)  Mon 5:45PM-7:45PM (starting March 12)  ...for a total of 15 credits this semester.  No classes till 2:30PM on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday! I'm a happy man! :D  Vernon just informed me that we might go to Sneaky Pete's tonight to get wasted, so I better bust out with my colored pencils and junior license and get to work!  -BIGsmut.

      Yoooooo! Big Smut comin' atcha from AAAAAAAAAALBANY!!!  Finally got up here Monday afternoon and wasted no time doing guess what - DRINKING - with my suitemates and good friends up at Club 21. Beer pong, drunken karaoke, card games, and good times pretty much sum up the past couple of days. Tonight I learned how to play Texas Hold 'Em (a spinoff of poker) - it's a great game! We started out with 8 people and it came down to me and Bob dueling it out, but he's too good at it so I lost all my chips rather quickly. Give me a few weeks and I'll own all of you...  Today was the first day of classes, and guess what happens -- the MyUAlbany server goes down so I can't get my new class schedule off the computer! That means everyone on campus has no idea when or where their classes are! Utter confusion all day long. I think I made it to all the right classes...  More good news: My macroeconomics professor can barely speak English. I should get 6 credits for taking that class: 3 credits for completing the class, and 3 credits for interpreting Chinese.  We stole a huge new couch from the hall so any visitors to Cooper 207 will have a nice couch to pass out on. Come visit ANYTIME!  Gotta wake up for a 8:45AM Physics lecture tomorrow (blehhhh), so I gotta get going.  Peace!!!  -BIGsmut.

      Ate dinner with the BiG SMUT at around 5pm.. Chartwells food is worser than ever. After i smoked up eric and derek at club 21 with the magical bong everyone got me for X mas. Then me and the guys played Texas Holdem.. a modified version of poker.. we were practicing for a tournament that was being held up in the penthouse.. when it was about time for the tournament we went up and there was chips, soda, and free pizza!  We all had the munchies so we ate all the food.  Then it was our turn to play at the table.. after 16 hands.. i come out with the most $$ in chips.. therefore i win the tournament. The RA's prize was a t shirt and $15 in podium.. not bad..  Went back down to 21 and madd ppl came in to play power hour. i didn't want to drink bc i had class the next morning.. but eric couldn't finish his beer so i drunk 3 beers in one hour... decent buzz.. at around 1 am Angelo comes back from a weed run..  smoked 2 bowls and beautiful dutch rolled by eric .. the guys and girls zone out to winamp5 visualizations in james' room.. i leave at 230am.. went back to the room and ate food while watching True Lies.. awesome movie.  Today.. woke up at 1130 am.. went to MyUAlbany to get my class schedule.. and the server is down... i'm supposed to be in class right now.. but i don't know what room.. i don't know if i should blame myself for not printing out my schedule.. or blame UAlbany's shitty web based system. i didn't get enough sleep last night.. i'm frustrated..  i hate missing class.. especially the FIRST day ..  Have a SMUTTY day..  - R w L super SMUT

      i promised to keep all you SMUTS and SLUTS posted while up hurr in Albany.. so here...  yesterday got back up around 2.. it took about two and a half hours to unpack and put everything back in place.. the BiG SMUT arrived here at about 5:30.. he suggested that we eat at Pizza Smut after he unpacks.. in the meantime Kate invited me over.. put the bottle of rum (thanks Rez) in my bookbag and proceeded to the 9th floor. Had a few shots on an empty stomach... got pretty buzzed.. gave kevin a call he said..   "I'm at club 21.. we're just going to order pizza!"  :/   but i wanted pizza smut. me and kate took the tunnels to burger king.. somehow we got lost in the tunnels.. i swear to god we're  dumb and dumber .. ate bk and got lost on the way back too! went back to the 9th floor and drunk some more rum while watching big fat abnoxious fiance.. then headed up to club 21! Drunk some more rum mixed with orange soda.. and most of the guys came back from a beer run. Went back to my room to get cups and ping pong balls for beer pong. In my room i fucking had my open bookbag sitting on my chair and the  bottle of rum falls and shatters on the floor ! i was so upset. cleaned it up and brought up a 22 of high grav. went back up to club 21 and me and kate were a team against eric and josh in beer pong.. we lost the game.. but i drunk a lot of beer so  i really didn't lose .. the 22 of high grav went fast so i ran back down to my room to get my last 22 and then ran back up.  Played another game of beer pong with Angelo being my partner against two other guys whos name i don't know.. we win... i drink more.. i try to do magic tricks with a deck of cards but it didn't work out..  where's chris when you need a magician ?! bring the 22 to derek's room.. where we are all doing karaoke.. so much fun.. i love singing..!   Ok.. now people who know me know that i NEVER get piss drunk to the point where i can't walk.. mostly because i throw parties and i have to keep the party and myself under control.. but since i'm the guest of the party.. i drink like a monster.. i haven't been that drunk in months   2am.. eric wants to sleep so he kicks everyone out of his room.. me and kate go back to her room.. we layed down and i just kept drunken rambling blah blah blah.. i'm sorry you had to put up with it! i passed out cold at like 230am.. woke up at 530am still drunk and dizzy as hell..  run to the bathroom and puke .. lay next to kate and pass out again.. wake up at about 1 pm and feel like shit.. kate's suitemate's parents are in the suite area.. i wanted to go out there in my boxers and be like ughhh i'm so hungover..   130pm kate walked me out  (walk of shame)  and i went back to my room.. kev was sleeping as usual and zach was listening to skinhead music. zach blew a horn which woke up kevin and most of UAlbany.. and now here i am.. i need to shit shower and shave my balls.. keep you guys posted.. peace!!!  - R w L super SMUT

      Hi everyone this is your neighborhood friendly SmUckRaKeR. What you are about to read will probably make absolutely no sense to you. I find it hilarious. Please, if you attempt to read which i suggest you do, you MUST go ALL the way down to Bryans last post and read up. It's quite a tale so make sure u have some time. Think hard and see if u can figure ANYTHING out.  Also, I would like to explain one blog i have already recieved questions on. In one blog I have used ???????'s. These are used to remove key names and vital information so that Reza is saved from a reaming of words.  Enjoy at your own risk.  -i||eGiTiMiT_SoN_oF-GOD-

      Touche ol' chap, touche.... I will now stop the ensuing flame through facts that i will not again speak of after this blog. 1. Mandy is still on my hit list, it's all planned out. That bitch is gonna be crying when I'm done with her.  And 2. I have decided i will go to stillettos with you reza, good news??? Ohhh I think not... U said you have a month to a month and a half before your return to the strip club, MUCH more than enough time for me to save up the $200 for the UBER SPECIAL V.V.I.P. room. I will be calling in before i go, and I will make sure Krya's there and in a great mood. It'll be bad enough u thinking about me with her for the 30 minutes, but then when i come out ill make sure i throw the B.J. condom down on the table in front of you, or better yet i could use that in my plan for mandy somehow.... Hmmmm, good idea Andrew.  BTW Bryan, Nice quote bio-dome is one of my fav movies ever, I have it too. I think it would be an awesome one for a [SMUT] viewing we should figure that out sometime.

      There is a difference between bad grammar online (i.e., omitting apostrophes and camas) and your form of bad grammar, which consists of saying "your" instead of "you're", saying "their" instead of "there" or "they're", as well as other mistakes.    The only reason I started nitpicking your grammar was because you nitpicked me (I said except instead of accept once) and you were like, "Muahahah that's 1-0 me"....20 minutes later it was 1-20 me.   As they say in the movies....Boo Ya.

      How are you all? I have not recorded any text in this box for many a day, so I shall sit at this computer of mine until the words being created in my brain are processed by my tounge, through my fingers and written for all to see. First, I would like to start by saying that it is wretched not being able to go to strip clubs for the simple reason that I was born a couple months too late, because I missed my opportunity to view a Ms. Brianna Banks. I also missed her sit on my comrade Reza's lap and give him a kiss. Secondly, I agree with Darin's assessment about the festivities, or lack there of, in the North Rockland area. It is just plain dispicable of us as Smut members to occupy the Smut house every weekend night. We must rise up against the powers that are supressing our teenage hormones and we must do what teenagers do, not what children do (ie. listen to our parents). We must start a revolution. Today, one may ask, "what is there to do in North Rockland" and the usual answer is, "Abso-fucking-lutely nothing". This must all change. The next time someone asks you, "what are you doing tonight?" it is necessary that the answer is "having fun at......'s house!"   We must start a revolution! Viva Los Bio Dome

      Jesus Fucking Christ, you guys went crazy last night. I didn't know that you guys could debate so adamantly on a movie about two stoners that get locked in a dome. I'm sorry I started the "blog fight". As Doug would say, "It's the fight of the century!" (Doug's drunken mumblings throughout the Freddy Vs. Jason movie).  Fucking International Business final tomorrow. Somebody throw away the test. PLEASE!  P.S. We all have to jump Ms. Bassani someday. It'll be fun.

      yes everyone, reza kissed a girl who tossed some guy's salad, has performed ass to mouth, sucked numerous amounts of wangs, and has taken a many money shots... CONGRATS REZA         Sorry about that reza, sorta shouted you out, you can make fun of me later...      It is sad to say that three avid [SMUT] members (bob, kev, and jay) have left to their colleges, a sad day indeed. But my friends, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. With their absence, i say we take heed, start drinking and smoking on our OWN accord, as in we go out to find parties, so when the preceeding three return, we can say that yes, we know where theres a party, yes you guys can come, no bob, you dont need to have people over. We owe this to them.     Along with making life easier for them we must come to a realization: THIS IS OUR FUCKING SENIOR YEAR. We must go out and visit bob and kev, we must convince our parents that this is our last year here, that we are almost (if not already) 18 years old and we can stay out later than 11. We must drink and smoke to our hearts CONTENT. No regrets fellas, lets make this last year something we can remember forever (or, depending on what you do, DONT REMEMBER).    Think about what i wrote my [SMUT]TY ones, and think long...  farewell Stimpith J.

      Hello, Smutty ones...  So allow me to tell you how I came thisclose to Briana Banks's pussy and how I grabbed her tits and how I kissed her on the lips (rather, how she kissed me on the lips).   Ok, so Briana Banks, internationally reknowned porn star, was at stiletto's this weekend. I went on Friday. I tried to convince people to go, but in the end, Xavier was the only one who wanted to. Luckily, just as we were passing Austin's house X got a call from him and he wanted to go to. So we all go. We get there at 12:45ish...Briana is schedualed to go on stage at 2 AM...the place is packed...i get a seat on the edge of the stage (one of the few seats) and I don't budge for the next two hours until she finally comes on at 3 AM (although just befoer she went on 6 strippers were doing lesbian acts on stage...that wasn't too bad either). Ok so she gets on stage and is getting ready to start...she glances at my direction and I lip to her, "I love you." She smiled...started her dance...about ten minutes into her dance she started coming up to the people with seats...I was one of them (there was a gillion people standing behind me)...so she comes up to me...moves my hands off the little table thingy seperating the stage and the seats...and sits there...spreads her legs...grabs my hair...and moves my head back and forth thisclose fom her vagina. Amazing...after that she kisses me on the lips (I was the first she kissed but she did make out with a girl in the audience)...After that, I raised both my hands into the air and everyone there was like "ahhhhhhh" and I got high fives all over the place....I also have a picture of Briana sitting on my lap, legs spread, with my hands on her tits. Bob will be putting that on the smut site.   Sick Pleasure of the Day: Enjoying that weird "pain" type of feeling you get when you hold a shit in. Admit it you sick pieces of shit.

       When I left for Albany in September.. i missed home.. after not too long i found a new home.. I loved being in Albany.. even though my luck up there wasn't always good.. i really did have the time of my life up there... i saw things that you could only see on TV.. i experienced things that most people don't experience...  I came back home to Rockland and i missed Albany.. some of my friends all of a sudden felt like strangers to me.. over time i strengthened relationships with all of my friends and made new ones.. i had a fucking blast down here and home really feels like home again.. things are really getting fun here, but now i have to leave again...  I'm going to miss you all.. but as our Arnold says.. "I'll be back!"

Just found my sword.. training with it right now at 2:43 am...   Elrond: Anduril, flame of the west, forged from the shards of narsil.

      Yooooo how's it going my fellow smutters? I've dropped out of the blog scene for a while so I'm just checkin' in to let everyone know that I didn't fall off the face of the earth. I promise that I will post more frequently when I get back to school.  Lately I've been watching Cartoon Network (gasp!)- well, only for two great shows:  The Family Guy  and  Futurama . I regret missing out on these shows when they first came out, especially before Futurama was canned by Fox. I'll try to catch up on all the missed episodes by watching the reruns on Adult Swim.  The snow is piling up outside as I speak. After consulting with the weather.com radar (I guess I'm a nerd), here are my predictions: 4 inches of snow by morning, 2 hour delay for the NRHS crew, and 10 homeless people die from the wind chill. If you wake up and see only 2 inches of snow tomorrow morning, don't kill me -- I'm not getting paid to make these forecasts yet. : )  Before I go, I'd like to congratulate Darin, Doug, and BK on their successful season!  Until next time,  -BIGsmut.

      Two old friends were just about to tee off at the first hole of their local golf course when a chap carrying a golf bag called out to them, "Do you mind if I join you? My partner didn't turn up."  "Sure," they said, "You're welcome."  So they started playing and enjoyed the game and the company of the newcomer. Part way around the course, one of the friends asked the newcomer, "What do you do for a living?"  "I'm a hit man," was the reply.  "You're joking!" was the response.  "No, I'm not," he said, reaching into his golf bag, and pulling out a beautiful Martini sniper's rifle with a large telescopic sight.  "Here are my tools."  "That's a beautiful telescopic sight," said the other friend," can I take look? I think I might be able to see my house from here."  So he picked up the rifle and looked through the sight in the direction of his house.  "Yeah, I can see my house all right. This sight is fantastic. I can see right in the window. Wow, I can see my wife in the bedroom. Ha ha,  I can see she's naked! What's that? Wait a minute, that's my neighbour in there  with her ....... he's naked as well! The bitch!"  He turned to the hitman, "How much do you charge for a hit?" "I do a flat rate, for you, one thousand dollars every time I pull the trigger."  "Can you do two for me now?"  "Sure, what do you want?"  "First, shoot my wife, she's always been mouthy, so shoot her in the mouth.  Then the neighbour, he's a mate of mine, a bit of a dickhead, so just shoot his cock off to teach him a lesson."  The hitman took the rifle and took aim, standing perfectly still for a few minutes.  "Are you going to do it or not?" said the friend impatiently.  "Just wait a moment, be patient," said the hitman calmly, "I think I can save you a thousand dollars here....."

      yo darin comin atcha from the computer lab at nr. me and kevin (the not-so-puerto-rican puerto rican) are working on our final module paper. I would like to mention the [smut] members and og members and other people who came to the meet yesterday, thanks for doing so. also, did anyone see that girl crying? i think it was my fault, cause i beat her like hardcore in the back... bigah, sore loser. the next meet is wednesday against kieo academy, its senior recognition day, and we want to go out by destroying those heartless people (actually, they are very intelligent and smart, but they are probably conjuring ways to take over the planet). So eveyone please come and stop the movement.   for some reason, when i thought of the kieo kids taking over the planet, it reminded me of that coheed song. "Apollo, what should i do next..."

      Today was great, Two-Hour delay, shortened periods, does it get any better of course it does just not during high school. Oh and at lunch I was made "tray bitch" and disappointed with this tasks me and some fellow lunchmates came up with a plan... I was to take up the four trays, trip and fall face first on the floor dropping all the trays across the floor and running out with my hands over my face (I owe that to Chris)... Not that things of this sort haven't been done before but I thought it to be a good idea at the time. Anyways as I was going up I really wasn't thinking about doing it until I heard someone say "He isn't going to do it." That was enough of a motive for me I juggled the trays hit the back of my heel with the front of my other foot and went face first to the floor... The landing....IMPECCABLE... and i proceeded to run out of the lunchroomwith my hands over my face.               But it didnt stop there thinking clearly i took off my blue striped buttoned down shirt balled it up in my hand and made a break for it. I made the turn around the corner and literally bumped into a security guard on the walkie-talkie saying "Blue striped shirt you say?" By then I was hysterical laughing and a lil scared that they were actually looking for me. To clear my mind i went to the swim meet after school to watch Brian Doug Darin and MarK. They had to swim against this girly team literally.... girls!! What girls stand a chance against some of the strongest [SMUT]s around?!?!? None except maybe China from wrestling she's mad butch. But even she probably couldnt swim better than them but if she lost she would get mighty pissed and wreak havoc on the Swimming[SMUT]ters. Then they would jump in the water and taunt her cuz she would never be able to catch them! Especially since she would be in such awe if watching them do the butterfly stroke or watching Jesus dive. Well I gotta get to start some homework... AND ONE MORE THING IM NOT TRAY BITCH TOMORROW!!!

      Hey, its Adam Grant. It took me long enough to get a damn username, not to mention one i didn't even want lol.  Anyways, Bobert threw another unexpected, yet amazing party to which everyone and their mother came to. One thing that totally sucks is when you dont have any money to drink and everyone has a beer in their hand and is having a good time... does this mean i rely on drugs and alcohol to much to have a good time (I hope not). Chris tried to prostitute his room in order to make profit off of overly-horny teenagers, NOT A BAD IDEA!! And another thing about not having money it makes it really hard to gamble...but thanks to some generous people i was able to get in on the action and got up pretty high. However i always give into Reza when I've taken him for alot of his money and he still wants to go... then i end up losing way too much and supporting not only his gambling addiction but his Stillettos addiction as well (your welcome Reza....enjoy). I cant wait till next weekend after i save up all my lunch money and can party hard and maybe go on a "trip" via some kind of vegetables. lol JK (or am I). Got school tomorrow and I'm goign to have to chill with my impulsive outbursts or I'm going to be kicked out of Physics by Luft... Oh well, I'll have another lunch period and an easy class. And I would take my remaining time to congradulate Katie and Darin on being accepted to colleges. Later all you smutty people...

      I would just like to comment on the party last night... For a bunch of people that used to look down at [SMUT], think that were not funny, or think that we are losers for whatever reason, you sure didnt seem to have a problem drinking/spilling alcohol, smoking in the garage, doing lines in the bathroom, or screaming at the top of your lungs especially when his father said to keep it down. Fuck everyone   Darin

      hello peoples.. well i see this blog is starting to get a little bit dry, so i'm going to lick my fingers and smear my mouth's contents on it.. as i was saying before; i'm not going to reveal anything i don't feel i need to, so i will talk about things i don't mind sharing... yesterday was another unexpected party, which every member of smut likes to drag themself into.  i'm starting to become concerned with the drug problem here in this area.. cocaine, shrooms, marijuana, and alcohol in one night? how is that any good for your body?  oh well, as long as those i care about don't get pulled into that mess.  i remained sober of any malficient products last night.  to me, it's not even worth any of the fun...  anyways, change of subject: in english we watched the chocolate war on vhs.  now, i didn't read the book, but i read the first 40 pages and then the sparknotes.  the mood of the book and the movie was that of a hopeless one; although the movie played a lot of strange techno music..  so the whole time I'm watching the movie (which is pretty accurate to the book), i'm thinking it's going to end the same hopeless way the book did, and i would feel very gloomy for the rest of the day..  Instead, at the very end, archie picks out a black marble!  and the whole ending scene changes into that of a happy hollywood ending.. i was so giddy, i wanted to tear...  in conclusion.. do drugs if you want, but understand the consequences  - with love, sir shades of the ringzilla smut

      what up playas, mr d commin atcha  even though the big smut was not at alumni day, it was a pretty cool. ive never seen a person have soo much food on one tray, or eat soo many potato chips as bob did. Yes, if reza does succeed in scoring with this stripper, he should become the leader of team smut. then we can legally fight any person or group and say it was a jihad. thatd be awsome...  until next time, farewell Stimpith J  P.S. Sandy bowe is amazing. extreme pain will be given to the anyperson that says/thinks differently.

      I didn't go to the seawall.. I drove with James and Kev to McD and got free food. Dropped them off. Headed in the direction of the seawall but it got really cloudy.. no stars.. no fun.. drove home. Warmed up popcorn mixed it with buffalo sauce, also had some rolls with butter. I love 3am snacks. Shortly after i layed in bed for about 3 hours. I didn't sleep i just layed there. 6am came. played max payne and drank black tea, ran out of lemon. picked up lauren at 7am and drove to annie's for breakfast. ate scrambled eggs and sausage and COFFEE while telling her general story of how my four years of high school went. fun. drove back home. took shower. lauren picked me out outfit with matching boxers. lauren is sooo chill. all girls should be like lauren. 8:30am smoked my bowl in the garage by myself. thought that going to alumni day high would be fun... it kinda wasn't... it just made me stupid...  i'm going to slow it down with pot .  I haven't been THAT stoned in a while. Everything moved all choppy.. like the way things look in a strobe light. Got a little nervous that i wouldn't perform as well in school.  high   9am drive to school. Go to Mrs. Bassani's 3rd period class. I get a standing ovation! The students asked us some pretty smutty questions. I couldn't stop laughing most of the time because chris adam and kevin were saying stupid shit. Why does Rodriguez constantly echo Yudman......? It went something like...  Yudman: "Is there a lot of drug use at your school." Rodriguez: "Yeah.. what about drug use?!"  They asked some pretty smutty questions.. i had to put my head down to laugh most of the time. Went to all the lunch periods. 4th period i play cee lo with Reza. $5 bet. Lose $5. Later in the period $20 bet with Johnny O. Win $20.  Up $15 ! Happy. It was so much fun seeing everybody at lunch and in the hallways. I visit some classes too. Also visit Mr Hardy and Mr Haibon. I also went to Mrs. Bassani's 7th period class. Nick (Dr. Smut) was in that class. That class asked more smutty questions than Bassani's 3rd period class.   Nick: "How much do the drugs influence you in college." Me: "HOW MUCH DO THE DRUGS INFLUENCE  YOU  NICK."  The class laughed.. We also started talking about shrooms.. me and nick looked at each other like we didn't shroom last Saturday night. Drove home with Lauren after 7th. Listened to music and shit while Andrew weighed out his options. At around 4pm me and andrew drive to haverstraw for more mushrooms. I get 2.5 grams for $25. Shrooming with Karen this weekend if she wants to. Reza calls. Wants to go to Stiletos bc he has a date with a stripper named Kyra. We invite Karen and Xavier to go. They chicken out.  About 530 pm me and Reza or should I say John Schwartz from Cornell, walk into Stiletos. $10 water. 545pm a stripper named Nikki takes the stage.  I fall in love . I want Nikki. I wait about an hour for Nikki to come out. During that hour another stripper kept bothering me for a lap dance.. Tired of waiting for Nikki... go upstairs with other stripper.. can't remember her name. Lap dance wasn't bad.. she held my face in her chest the whole time and grinded hardcore.  Wait another 15 min for nikki. She comes out from dancing with some dorky guy. I wanted to kill him. nikki takes the stage. i go to the stage. nikki dances in front of me and puts her head down. I told her i've been waiting for her and i want a dance... i finally get my dance... we go upstairs and she mounts herself on top of me and starts dancing.. i start talking to her..  Me: "I waited so long for you. You're the most beautiful girl here." Nikki: "Thanks that's sweet." Me: "You look really young how old are you?" Nikki: "I'm twenty-four." Me: "You look like you're eighteen." Nikki: "Yeah i get that a lot."  I could have sworn she was 18, but at that point she was rubbing the cock so good that i didn't care. I got two lap dances in a row from her. It was amazing. After i come back down and Reza ugh i mean John is no where to be found. He comes back with drinks from Dunkin Donuts for his stripper girlfriend. She was pretty hot.. but not as hot as Nikki. Reza gives her his cell phone and she starts kissing him on the cheeks and lips. It's now time to get the fuck outta there. We spent two hours in there and i spent $75 :-/   !!!  I'm going to gamble hardcore this weekend and get all my $$ back!!  8pm Reza and I go to Bleacher's. Katie hooks us up with food. Katie is soo chill..  I love Katie .. Andrew joins us for dinner. We talk about smutty things...  Me: "Would you perform cunnilingus on Kyra?" Reza: "Yes." Me: "Would you perform anilingus on Kyra?" Reza: "Yes." Me: "If she asked you to do coke for kinky hardcore sex..." Reza: "Yes!"  If any SMUT member has sex with a stripper they are automatically promoted to the  Leader of TEAM[SMUT] . Reza dropped me off after dinner. Took a nap from 9pm-1am. and now here i am...  I haven't slept in a long time.. it is that time. good night!!

      At about 10 pm, I walk upstairs with a Bud Light necklace (thanks Lauren) around my neck...   Mom: "Bud Light! You drink too much Bud Light."  Dad: "Let the boy have fun."   Woke up at 6pm today. Ran and worked out. Showered. Ate breakfast. Dressed. Got a bong with James, Kev, and Mike Bateman. Ate at McD parking lot. Make things out of clouds. Baked some more. Sitting here now listening to music..   Its crazy, I'm thinking just as long as you're around. In here I'll be dancing on the ground. Am I right side up or upside down? To each other, we'll be facing. My love, my love, we'll beat back the pain we've found. You know, I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking, deep inside my  friend. With each moment the more I love you. Crush me, come on, baby...   I'm going to mellow out to the clouds and stars by the seawall now.. peaceee

      My roommates, Club 21, my dorm, late-night drives, my friends, Empire Plaza, being 120 miles from Rockland, frat parties, everything you want in a 3-mile radius, the girls, city life, freedom, and responsibility. That's Albany in a nutshell -- and I miss all of it. Well, maybe not ALL of it -- I sure don't miss shitting every 5 minutes from eating the campus food.  After a two week flirt with freedom, the high schoolers have to go back to their jail cells (NRHS) tomorrow. :::evil laugh::: Don't worry, only 6 more months fellas. Bob and I are coming in Tuesday for Alumni Day, so keep your eyes open for us! That is, if I can wake up before noon...  Until next time,  -BIGsmut.

      New Years. It's 2004 (although according to 98% of my relatives it's 1382). Rejoice. I went to paul's where the cops came after about two hours. Paul, being in the mob that he is, tried to bribe the cops. I went to Amanda Leanard's afterwards. I have yet to actually see this girl Amanda even though I've been to her house about 4 times now. Then I went to bobs with 15 minutes to spare before the new year was ushered in. At 12:01, I went to get BK, desiree, doug, and jes mcgannon from amanda lenards because they were stuck. It took them 20 minutes to leave, which did annoy me. Anyway, back to bobs, it was fun. Everyone was being Dr. Phil which is a good thing, I suppose, but annoying when you want to have fun and are being told not to disturb people every which way. Let's just say there was a lot of "tree blocking" last night. Anyway, its 2004. Whooopdi fucking doo. Rockland still sucks...people in rockland suck....life sucks. O well.   -Suicide Smutter

      "Damn, she's looking better and better with every beer I have!" -Andrew to the Outback waitress  What a great New Years Eve! Thanks to everyone for making me feel better after having a shitty start to the day. Hopefully the rest of 2004 is filled with good times like last night.  At around 7PM, a large portion of [SMUT] went to the Outback for our last meal of 2003. While waiting for the food, everyone played dice. There were some large bets and I think Nick and Bob were the only two who walked away happy. Somehow I managed to hold off without gambling most of the night despite my Win For Life addiction. The real fun started when the waitress brought out the Outback bread. K-Rod and Chris had a contest to see who could fit an entire loaf in their mouth all at once. Chris won, and then started to regurgitate the bread, which looked like he was pooping from his mouth. That's when the manager came over and yelled at us for swearing and being too rowdy. Haha, good times.  After dinner we picked up a ton of beer at Amoco and headed over to Bob's. This was probably one of the best parties that Bob ever had. Everyone was wasted off their ass and having a good time. We celebrated New Years for each of the U.S. time zones. It's funny how bad the countdowns suck for the other time zones. The real party is on the east cost, bitches. At some point during the night I got drunk enough to dance. Haha, big mistake there. Thanks to Katie for putting up with my shitty dancing. : ) After about 12 beers (I lost count very early), Adam was nice enough to give me a ride home. Thanks Adam!!!  Jeff, one of my suitemates from Albany, has invited Bob, Andrew, and myself down to his house in Nanuet for another party tonight. I've heard good things about Jeff's parties so I can't wait.  -BIGsmut.

      So I was planning on going to Desiree's party today (as in at 1:30 PM) but no one could go and I didn't want to be the only guy there (normally this would be a good thing...but I don't have luck with the ladies)...anyway..so I drove around...went to patricias...talked to pat and jacki for like an hour..drove around some mroe...got a car wash...farted a few times....ummm....all in all this week has been pretty good, relative to the other crappy weeks before it...I'm actually in a fairly good mood for once...well, maybe not a good mood..but not a bad one.   And yes, drugs are bad...I've been saying it for a while...any drug besides weed is bad...doing any drug at all before noon is bad and sad. Otherwise, commence with the herbal drug usage.   P.S.: DOn't you love when uyou have to pee hardcore and then you do and you feel like a million bucks? I do.

      My first post on this wonderful page. Bob you said make it SMUTTY... So last nite was my boys birthday party, and it was quite the event. non-stop funneling. u ever notice how everyone is pro at funneling. even the people that puke right after. (Derek farted and it smells like a rotting camel carcasses ass.) We all went skiing, some more then others. My boy went skiing on these 2 hot but dumb bitches stomachs, damn if u saw u would be jealous. action continued with a puke fest in club 207 and the return of ms. shudt. ARE U IN COOOPER? no bitch get the fuck out before i beat with a used condom.  i disappeared with a friend from the rubber circle factory, but alas no ribbed pleasure was to be found. results of the nite, i need to get laid, amber and i miss u were once two of my favorite songs, but now  after hearing them for hours, the suck my balls.

      woke up at 1150am. put on clothes and walked to physical geography. we have a test on monday and the professor gave us a half assed review because he "wasn't feeling well." He was obviously hungover. He let us out 40 minutes early, but said he would review more for people who wanted to stay. so i stayed and joked around with lauren a bit, reviewed and left. went back to my room and took a shower. when i got out the guys wanted to go eat, so i quickly threw on some clothes and ran down to the dining hall. lunch wasn't so bad i ate fish, fries, salad, and pizza. after i went back to the room and played some holdem online, listened to music, and got dressed. had calculus from 330-430 and  right after calc i went straight to my fridge and started drinking . at around 9 i went to club 21 with christine, jackie, and some other girl from st. rose. they stayed for 5 minutes and said something about meeting up with their friend and they never came back.. supposedly the girl i didn't know was being a bitch.. jackie and christine called and apologized about their PMSing friend. whatever. i had madd fun anyway. i witnessed madd people blow. i let abby and a couple of the girls borrow one of my  mr. benjamin franklin's . it took them so long to finish, i just wanted my bill back. i was surprised to see the girls up on 21 be so much into old school video games like zelda for nintendo and almost every mario game. this one girl beat me in mario kart! wtf. a lot of people, a lot of fun. didn't smoke pot, didn't hook up with anyone. i didn't want to. i was a good boy.  :-Pd-:  i love college! i can't wait for it to be warm out. i'm tired of being indoors. i'm tired of wearing clothes. i want to go skinning dipping in karen's pool again. i want to go to the beach with my boys and dive for frisbees and get sand in my mouth. i want to bask in the sun all day, wear sandals, eat cold crisp fresh sliced watermelon. i need a blow job. badly. i'm tired. i'm going to bed. kevin just made loud fart noises to people outside our window it was a riot i couldn't stop laughing. ok i'm done.  Have a smutty day.  - R w L super SMUT

      "Now that everyone and their mother reads this thing, I can't even talk about everything that's on my mind... Come to think of it, it's more like 75% laziness, 25% censorship." -BIGsmut  I also find myself censoring posts in this blog because many would find it to be distasteful, obscene, even inappropriate.  I am the leader of [SMUT]. My name is SUPER SMUT. And I am smutty, very smutty.   This  post is going to be uncensored. If you are sensitive to sexual content, pervasive language, or drug refrences STOP READING NOW.   I woke up at 11am this morning and went straight to one of my favorite web sites http://www.frogsex.com/movies/lesbian0.html . I have a fetish for lesbians. The porn on the internet is garbage. Pervert guys start their own porn business and post their videos on the internet. one in particular welivetogether.com really pisses me off. it's about a couple lesbian girls who supposedly find some "random" chick on the street, bring her back to the house, and eat her out. It's obviously set up, but that's not what pisses me off.  THEY CAN'T EAT PUSSY FOR SHIT.  they don't even try! are they not getting paid enough? are they even really lesbians? or are they stupid and don't know how to tounge fuck ?! it aggrivates me, it really does. so i just went to my 15 gigs of smut and finished what i started.  after that i was hungry so i poured a bowl of fruity pebbles. halfway into eating the bowl.. i realized that i had to take a shit, but it's thursday and the guy who cleans our bathroom was due to clean at any second! i said fuck it and i took a shit and then i took a shower. in the shower i noticed that i haven't shaved my pubes in 5 days so i got the razor and shaved. a word to the guys, shave your ass because you never know when a bitch is crazy enough to toss your salad! after the relaxing shower i got dressed and walked to class with christine. on the way to class we talked about shrooming and she is so god damned closed minded about it. i just stopped talking about it. logic was a borefest. we actually worked in groups this time. after logic i went back to the dorm and watched the Butters episode of south park. watch it, it is a riot. then me and kev headed over to calculus. my head was spinning after i left, it's not hard at all it's just tedious! and then at 430pm i went back to the dorm and started on some laundry. during the 26 minutes it takes for the clothes to wash i did some calc homework. then um i put the clothes in the dryer and went to eat with kev and jeff. dinner really sucked balls. it was terrible. i ate chicken steak, pasta, and stuffed pepper. afterwards i got my laundry from the dryer and put my clothes away. as i was doing that kevin was blogging and i had to take another shit. this shit was so dirty, it took several wipes to finally clean my ass. then i read kevin's blog and he mentioned censorship so i said i'm going to do something smutty to blog and i will write an uncensored blog. i took some flyers for a club called "sneaky pete's" and walked down the hall. some girl's door was open and i handed her a flyer and told her to go to the club and get drunk and have a lot of sex. after i went back and i had to take another dirty shit.  i hate chartwells food.  on average it makes us all shit 2-5 times a day. it's not even funny anymore. the food really really sucks ass. then i finished my calculus homework. then i started to blog and i have a headache. ar around 9pm we went on a beer run with Gerald. he is madd chill he gets us beer whenever we want. i got a 30 pack of keystone for $13. sneaking it in tonight was kinda tough because we had so much beer. but we managed to get it all in. 10 min ago kevin really wanted to order chinese food but minimum delivery is $10. i ordered a couple eggrolls so he can get his food. now here i am. i am really tired and i have a headache.  madd people from home want shrooms. I WILL DELIVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That is my uncensored blog. i hope you liked it. today really was a normal day. this weekend should be smuttier. maybe it's a slippery slope and i will be extremely smutty more often?? give me some feedback and i'll see..!!!!  I also added the team mascot to the smut site! Katie is very smutty.  Have a smutty weekend !!!  - R w L super SMUT

      YOOOOOO!!! What's goooooooood???  Long time no blog! Now that everyone and their mother reads this thing, I can't even talk about everything that's on my mind. My initial goal in blogging here was that I would give everyone a humorous, yet insightful, perspective of everyday college life. But now it appears that I won't be able to do that anymore. Oh yeah, and I'm lazy also. Come to think of it, it's more like 75% laziness, 25% censorship.  So.....I'm pretty disappointed that nobody has come to visit me and Bob up here in Albany since last semester. Andrew came up to visit in November, and James in December, but that's it. LEAVE THE LOW-LIFE INFESTED WENDY'S PARKING LOT, FUCK THE "LET'S DRINK BEHIND A SCHOOL" ASSHOLES, and COME UP TO VISIT!!! You might say "Kevin! You hypocrite! I've seen you at the Wendy's parking lot a few times!" But it only took me a couple of times to realize how gay it was. You guys waste more time and money driving around North Rockland on the weekends than you would spend driving up to Albany for a few days. Here you would eat for free, drink for cheap, experience college life firsthand, and have a BLAST all at the same time. Fuckin' a, spend your weekends more wisely, ya numbskulls. Bob and I go out of our way to visit you guys everyone once in a while, so the least you could do is come spend a weekend with us!!! Most of you have cars and money -- the excuses are getting lame. Don't get me wrong: I love partying at college, but I can't tell you how much it SUCKS to not see your good friends once in a while! I'm getting sick of driving home for a weekend, hoping that I will spend it with my good [SMUT] friends, but then instead wasting it with a bunch of scumbag drug-addicts that swarm the streets of North Rockland looking for the next party to crash. Half of the time, they're not even welcome at Bob's place. They just somehow "wander" in without Bob's knowledge or permission. It's not North Rockland that sucks. It's THESE PEOPLE. THEY make it suck. You know who you are, and you are NEVER welcome with us! Don't even show your face!  Whew. I am angry and sleep-deprived which probably contributing to my little rant there. Now that that's off my back, let me move on to bigger, brighter things. Next weekend Bob and I will be coming home to TEAR UP North Rockland. This is going to be a weekend of monsterous proportions. Buildings will crumble, people will scream, and.....and....uh, well I guess not. But let me assure you, there is ALOT of shit going down and it's going to be ALOT of fun.  Until next time,  -BIGsmut!  P.S. The next person to say "I'm Rick James, bitch!" will have a broomstick shoved up their asses. Sideways. Move on folks, Chapelle's Show was so last week.

      YES! I won another texas holdem tournament up in the penthouse! The prize? A $5 Blockbuster gift certificate.. wtf.. i got an albany t shirt last time! oh well.. today wasn't so bad.. woke up at 1030 am to study for my logic quiz. ate some fruity pebbles, showered, got dressed and went. it wasn't that bad.. i glanced at christine's paper and saw that she had the same answers as me.. so i handed it in along with a late homework, late because i just got the book. then at 130pm i was done with class for the day! i went back to the dorm and did some calc 2 homework and then erek asked me to walk to campus center with him to get the $$ he owes me. i go up to club 21 and he's smoking with some of the guys. i passed on the marajuana, not a big deal anymore. derek went on an OCD cleaning spree and made erek mop the floor. after that we all ate in the dining hall, it was "Marti Gras night" at chartwells. it sucked balls. the fried chicken wasn't that bad, but everything else sucked, they even had a DJ and he played awful music. then me and erek walked to campus center... well i walked, erek limped all the way because he sprained his ankle the night b4. he paid me $20, he owes me $30. on the way back in the tunnels.. there were two guys jogging who looked like Ace and Gary from the ambiguously gay duo!! it was a fucking riot. i went back to my room and did some more calc homework. then played some holdem online. went up to club 21 at around 830 and then went up to the penthouse and won the tournament (told you i'd win it for you) . now here i am. i updated the smut site again, everyone seems to be satisfied.  ok i created a post this morning because i was sexually frustrated, and then i thought i deleted it, but it published and I didn't know!! but now i am republishing it because kevin already saw it so what's the big deal now....!  i hate college sometimes. i never can find the chance to beat off. sure you can kick your roomate out of the room to bang.. but it would be very awkward to ask "please leave so i can squeeze one out."  The "jizz o meter" is very important to me. Let's say i haven't busted in a week.. i will mack it to just about any girl that comes my way.. Now let's say i busted two or three times and then i go to a social gathering.. i will not give two shits about getting any poon.. i think this applies to most guys. but i don't think i have a mindset like most guys. i don't care about hooking up or getting pussy. i've been there and done that so many times,  don't get me wrong i LOVE sex , but it's not important to me at all. i don't go around thinking.. oh when am i going to lose my virginity, or when am i going to get laid, or am i going to bang her.. i go around thinking who's going to be the next girl that really cares about me and that i can really care about. i've had a couple hookup relationships in the past few months that i thought would evolve into something great but it didn't.. so here i am sitting here wondering when..  maybe soon i hope .. but when it happens it's gonna be great it's gonna be more than i can take it's gonna be free it's gonna be real it's gonna change everything i feel it's gonna be sad it's gonna be true it's gonna be me it's gonna be you... it's gonna be love.   :-Pd-:   Call me a pussy.. call me whatever you want i don't care. i can bang britney spears.. but it's not what i want...  I'm done mouthing off for now...  Have a smutty day!  - R w L super SMUT

      What is good everyone! I have been chillin, doing a lot of homework, and a little bit of partying.. ok a lot of partying! Speaking of partying, my birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks.. yes i will be home on march 5.. and i will be hungry.. i am so sick of of the food up here.. the only thing good about chartwells is selling marijuana to the cooks! there is a smutty dinner scheduled for the night, followed by some late night festivities? maybe, maybe not. i am not giving the kids who hang around a church parking lot a place to drink! LOSERS! out of the 30 of you kids you can't go to one of your little houses?  SMUT ONLY !! vaginas. yes. vaginas... but i am bringing home some goodies (karen).. it should be an awesome time! My birthday lands on a Tuesday.. i only have one class that day.. and no class until 230pm the next day!! someone is getting drunk!!  :p  I have a revelation for you.. drugs are bad. drugs make you chemically depressed. you'll sit there and be angry and sad and mad at the world.. it's because you're crashing ( to experience the aftereffects (as dysphoria or depression) of drug intoxication ) . There is a link on this fucking site about how bad drugs are. i quit weed after realizing it does have a crash... don't do drugs. don't even try them. find a hobby,  have sex , masturbate, play cs, get a job, do your homework, find another addiction... coming from personal experiences ... drugs are bad, very very bad! you don't want to end up like purple mustang boy and suck cock for coke!  i don't believe i am doing anything for spring break.. i plan on playing outdoor sports and drinking, but not both at the same time! my semester is over on May 15.. yes it might seem very far from now.. but the days go by so fast up here in albany! SMUT will have a couple  six flags  trips this summer.. i might also go to the prom.. and SMUT will make another beach appearance! that's pretty much about it... oh! I UPDATED THE SMUT SITE!! there's a link on the right..  http://imrickjamesbitch.com  it went away.. did yours?   :-Pd-:  Have a SMUTTY day!!  - R w L super SMUT

      Whats up everyone  So i hope everyones vacation was good cause mine kinda sucked. it started out awsome when nick and kevin came over my house and we hit up the bodega (some drunk spanish dude to nick:someones getting FUCKED UP tonight!! (in response to nick carrying 4? sixpacks all on top of each other)) so the night before that was amandas and i was driving which wasnt that bad, but for some reason i was in a very irratible mood. Everyone was coming up to me trying to make conversation but i guess i wasnt in the mood, and as a result i was extremely nsaty to just about every person, and this attitude seemingly carried out through the week... ive done many apologies to those i feel i hurt or pissed off but if i forgot to apologies im sorry. Hopefully ill stop PMS'ing soon. last night made the vacation for me, thanks for driving john. ill talk to all soon  PS. for some reason i have started playing basketball. If any smuts or others wish to play just shout me a holla and ill go (unless there are extenuating circumstances of course). later darin

      Everyone remember the [SMUT] dinner where reza threw that carrot with ranch(or w/e kind of sauce it was) on it on me and soiled my shirt. Well i soiled his Benz. Pissed all over the rear of it. Best part is it was dirty enough that u could see all of my piss. It was actually more gratifying than I had anticipated.

      Whats up yall, darin comin atcha with a fuckin awsome lax story... On saturday me, evan g, pat, and a group of freshman played in an indoor lax tournament. It was the first time i played with these guys since 9th grade so i was pretty excited. Firstly, we destroyed these freshman punks that sucked so bad, it made me happy when i put one of them on his ass, especially after his cheap slash to one of my team mates helmets.. but the better story is about to come. We played a group of kids from suffern, and these kids sucked sooo much. Even though their skills were horrible, their goalie was amazing. His shot was faster than theirs and he was more accurate then all of them combined. Well to make a long story short he lit me up a couple times (the tournament was held in a gymnasium, so you can determine the size of the playing field). But one time he tried to be fancy and do a pass to one of his team mates right on my crease... well his pass was a little too close and high. the kid jumped up, looked away for two seconds, and when he was coming down, i fuckin LAID HIS ASS OUT!!!! it was one of those hits when the entire crowd goes "ohhhhh" and the person rolls over backwards (as in feet over head). after a good 5 mins of whining about the "no checking" policy which i obviously didnt care about, we lost 6-16 (wich sounds like a lot... and is...) but my friends, it was totally worth it

      How's it going, my fellow smutters? I hope all is well back home. "Senioritis" kicking in yet? This year is going so quick; soon we'll be able to say that all of [SMUT] is liberated from the dungeons of NRHS!  Alright. So what's new...  Last night, the doors in my car became permanently locked for some reason, so now I have to climb through the window to get in and out of my car. Fuckin' power locks -- good for nothing! Now if the windows stop working while I'm in the car, I'll be stuck in there. So if you don't hear from me for a week or two, you know what happened.  Friday night: ICE STORM!!! The best part of the night was seeing drunk people busting their asses on the quad, which was ultimately transformed into an ice skating rink. Fortunately, I didn't get drunk enough to fall on the ice and shake the earth.  I'll be seeing you guys soon. Until then, take care!  -BIGsmut.  P.S.  Don't get me started on toilet cloggings.

Arnold has a lot of quotes from that movie.. i couldn't stop laughing to them.. i looked out the window and the trees were swaying like crazy.. i just stared out the window for 10 mins.. and there also was a phone on the floor that was dancing.. i layed down in the bed and looked at the ceiling.. it had things that glow to the black light.. but the ceiling looked like it wasn't even there.. i could really see the stars outside and then a space ship was coming down to take me! but it never did! then i went to james' room where there is this trippy poster on the wall.. in it there was a sun beaming, birds flying, a waterfall falling.. it was amazing.. then i heard strange noises.. like the one in the jason movies.. ha ha ha ch ch ch ch.. it was all in my head though.. then we played texas holdem and i could even focus on the cards but i still RAN THE TABLE..  I'M RICH BIATCH!  The trip only lasted about two and a half hours but it was the best i've ever had. also got a bong at around 3am with josh and friends.. josh is on probation and his last time smoking will be today.......................  Last night i shotgun a beer at 11 and then played power hour with big smut and kate.. i was so wasted after 40 minutes.. my stomach was soo full from beer.. after that we played flip cup... i can flip the cup 6 times in a row! the night was a lot of fun..  power hour fucked me up until 5 am!!   my birthday is coming up ..  march 9 .. i'm going to come up with a list of things i want soon!  i have a 5 o clock appointment with the godfather at club 21 (7-10 grams) .. hopefully i won't die! last time i'm doing that for 2 weeks!  have a smutty day!  - R w L super SMUT

      I've always wanted a pet midget named Joseph. It would do my bidding and be my buddy at the same time. It would rest itself on my shoulder and whisper funny things about the people I'm associating with. He would only eat if he poops in the right place and not in my bed.   This isn't my life dream (that involves me, a bunch of llama, and a whooooollllleee lotta jiffy lube), but it's a dream.  -Suicide Smutter

      Upon reding my blog, Katie came up with a great point. Thank you Katie...  Q. What if said midget wanted to have midget sex???  A. If the midget pulled a 900 like Tony Hawk, I'd go out and buy the midget a midget prostitute for a full month and he'd get four weeks off from his skating to have a midget marathon session, I'd pay the prostitute extra though to get pregnant so i could groom my midget baby into the greatest skater EVER!!!!!!

      I've come to realize my life dream. First off you must know that when i see wee man skate on jack ass i get extremely excited, probably more happy than anything else gets me in the whole wide world.  Ok so for my dream to come true i first have to become filthy rich. Once rich I build a gigantic Midget Sized Skatepark in my basement. Then i buy myself a midget and tell him to learn how to skateboard or he starves. I'll most likely go through like 7 midgets but w/e who cares about them anyways??? Then once one gets good everyweek ill stop in on monday night and watch him skate for half an hour or so, Ill rate him on a scale of 1 to 10, and then depending on his score will be how much food he gets that week. If he gets a ten ill prob let him out of the house on his leash for a bit too.   This is my life dream....

      Today marks a great day in history. (No, not the fact that the Patriots won the Superbowl.) Thanks to Justin Timberlake, the entire country had the opportunity to see one of Janet Jackson's boobs on live national television! A smutty day, indeed.  In addition to the surprise titty shot, today's Superbowl was a great game! It came down to the final seconds of the game -- you really couldn't ask for a better Superbowl.  We had some special visitors to our dorm today: a couple of state troopers! Bob and I were playing a game of Counter-Strike at the time. Due to the loud nature of Counter-Strike, we didn't even notice the cops were in the dorm until they shined a flashlight at us. I almost shit my pants when I saw them, knowing that there's approximately 20 things in our dorm that could get us in deep shit. They asked us if we knew anything about a "suspicious green backpack" that was found "somewhere around the building." I later figured that they were using that as an excuse to check the dorms for people kicking back to some beer before the game. There was some tobacco strewn all over the table (because Zach rolls his own cigarettes), and the cops asked if it was weed. Please keep in mind that tobacco looks absolutely nothing like weed. Little did they know that Bob's fridge was packed with beer at the time, and that our couch is stolen from the hall. Cooper 207 came out unscathed! Man, those cops were fucking dimwits.  Ugh, a full week of classes to look ahead to. Happy happy, joy joy!  -BIGsmut.

      AH, good evening my good friends i would like to  make a shout out to jay, who let me and a select few visit him at stac last night... it started out slow, and then BAMM, started kickin ass. perhaps a little 4a.m. diner dialouge will give a little example of the night:  Evan (who just drank half a pint of JD and about 5 beers): Aright, i know I've been a dick to everyone, so if you want you can say whatever you feel about me right now and i won't care. Pat (who was also drunk): you're a douche bag Darin (the sober one who FEARED FOR HIS LIFE): I'm tired Jay (the crazy stripper): you are a RACIST NIGG*R Doug (what can you say about doug, especially after two high gravs?): catmeat  ahh my friends, a good night indeed farewell

      whats up yall, io had the wierdest thing ever happen to me today at lax that actually happens alot. You know when you look at or think of something for a long time and go to say a word or statement, and you say what you were looking at or thinking about? thats what happened. at the end of each practice, we do like a little team cheer. well i was looking at a lacrosse ball on the other side of the field, and i was looking at it because the girls lax team was walking by it and i KNEW they were going to steal it. so i was looking at it and my coach goes "darin call it (meaning the cheer) and i Say "BALLS ON Three", but im supposed to say team. i felt like an idiot, especially after coach grasso goes, "no its team on three dumbass, get the fuck out of here" i also laughed alot too thats my wierd experience, please be sure to leave a comment on shit that happens like that to you

      In response to Chris's post:  I was accepted into Binghamton as well; it's a great school (they call it the "Ivy of the SUNY's"). I have a few cousins who graduated from there and they had a great time. I toured the campus a bunch of times.....the dorms are okay but it's a LONG hilly walk between buildings. The campus is literally on the side of a mountain and Binghamton has some of the worst weather, even worse than Albany. You're not going to find much to do downtown either. The tradeoff for that is it's probably the best of the SUNY's academic-wise. The reason I turned down Binghamton is because they didn't have my major. If they did have my major it would have been a really tough call between Binghamton or UAlbany...  Stony Brook: I don't know much about the school but I'd rather stick needles in my eyes than drive on Long Island. Have you ever driven there? It fucking sucks. Everyone probably goes home on the weekends due to the school's proximity to the city and the rest of Long Island...  Albany seems to be a good choice with all those scholarships and the Honors Program. Albany has great academics if you're majoring in any of the sciences, humanities, or criminal justice fields. It's one of the top research universities in the nation, and it has a great graduate school if you're planning on more than a bachelor's degree. I'll admit that Albany's dorms kind of suck ass but if you're in the Honor's Program they have Honors halls on State Quad with much nicer dorms (so I've heard). When you're a junior you have the option of renting an apartment downtown or living on Empire Commons (soooooo nice). The atmosphere up here is laid back.....you'll make alot of friends quickly and you'll find yourself chillin in other people's suites half the time. The weather sucks just like Binghamton; cold, long, snowy winters with alot of wind. But the whole campus is connected with underground tunnels so you don't have to walk outside if you don't want to. Downtown Albany is awesome.....there's alot of bars that you can get in with a chalked ID. Plenty of keggers at the frat houses. The city itself is really nice too; there's pretty much every store and restaurant that you can think of within a 3 mile radius of UAlbany. Buses are free too. Only a 1 hour 45 minute drive from Rockland.....a really easy drive up the Thruway.  I love Albany, it's a great school and I'm glad I chose it. Binghamton is a good option as well. The choice is yours.....good luck.  -BIGsmut

      hey, chris here..  i recently have been accepted into Albany, Binghamton, and Stony Brook (Long Island), and to me, they all have their own advantages.. so i need your opinions.. here are the advantages of each:   Albany : honors program with $1500 a year, plus $6000 for graduate study, plus my brother and [SMUT] friends will be there for a lot of partying   Binghamton :  best school of the three in terms of education, may guarantee me success in life.. i also heard they have nice dorms   Stony Brook :  closest to the city, I've heard they're as lenient as Albany in terms of rules and alcohol and stuff.  I can possibly dorm with Danny if I go, which will be hilarious..  and it's easiest college to travel back home to rockland through public transportation.  So I need your help!..  If you haven't already gave me your opinion on the matter, then click on "comments" below.  you don't even have to give your name..  so help me out mums

      Not too much going on here... so far I have an A in 3 of my classes and a B- in my other one. A lot of tests and homework lately.. weekdays are really the same thing for me.. shower, food, class, gym, study, food, homework, sleep...  Friday night me, kev, and zach went to Jerald's house for a party because he would be going to the military the next day. All the beer you can drink for $2.. we were hanging out on the porch and harassing people who walked by.. "You're wearing a white t-shirt with blue jeans and you are walking down the street." Then a police car pulled a car over right in front of us and we walked inside.. The girls from St. Rose (St. Hoez!) came up and we chilled for a bit.. christine is probably reading this to jaclyn.. then there was a fight outside and then the cops raided some guys house... three incidents in two hours on one street.. the police were very busy friday night! we got a ride home from one of zach's friends and to the right of me sat a 37-43 year old man... he doesn't give his real age.. his name was pete.. i don't think he ever grew up.. he's still partying with college kids! we headed back up to club 21 for a bit but it was dry..  Saturday night Reza and Darin got hurr at about 8.. we ate out at Friendly's (no pun intended).. got some beer and taco bell.. and headed up to club 21.. highlights of the night: smoking the bong, 16 people game of flip cup,  me darin and erek losing 6 out of 7 games of beer pong to katie and ericka .. i complained about their cups being loose (pun intended).. i was being such an asshole that night i cracked a couple crude sexual jokes, but i was drunk... sorry... really drunk.. we went back to the room at about 3 in the morning... ate food uncontrollably and passed out.  Sunday we ate breakfast at the dining hall, then i showed darin and reza around the campus, took them down to the tunnels and a dark lecture hall.. then we drove downtown in the k wagon and saw a lot of milfs. empire plaza is a beautiful place. darin and reza had to go at about 3 we peaced out and then i studied all day and night.. i just took my physical geography exam and i really hope i get a B. i have a take home quiz due wednesday and i have a sociology of gender exam on fucking friday! this week is going to suck. i think we're getting beer tonight.. i plan on getting drunk thursday night.. and every night there after!  SPRING BREAK!   :-P  Have a smutty day !  - R w L super SMUT

      You've probably heard me say this a million times.. but i've stopped watching a lot of certain things on television. Why? Because i'm either too busy with school, or getting drunk, or both at the same time. There's another reason why i stopped watching television, propaganda- the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person.  i think, therefore i don't trust the media ... i just watched the documentary "Bowling for Columbine." it was enlightening...   Marilyn Manson: "The two by-products of that whole tragedy were, violence in entertainment, and gun control. And how perfect that that was the two things that we were going to talk about with the upcoming election. And also, then we forgot about Monica Lewinsky and we forgot about, uh, the President was shooting bombs overseas, yet I'm a bad guy because I, well I sing some rock-and-roll songs, and who's a bigger influence, the President or Marilyn Manson? I'd like to think me, but I'm going to go with the President. "  Michael Moore: "Do you know that on the day of the Columbine massacre, the US dropped more bombs on Kosovo than any other day? "  Marilyn Manson: "I do know that, and I think that's really ironic, that nobody said 'well maybe the President had an influence on this violent behavior' Because that's not the way the media wants to take it and spin it, and turn it into fear, because then you're watching television, you're watching the news, you're being pumped full of fear, there's floods, there's AIDS, there's murder, cut to commercial, buy the Acura, buy the Colgate, if you have bad breath they're not going to talk to you, if you have pimples, the girl's not going to fuck you, and it's just this campaign of fear, and consumption, and that's what I think it's all based on, the whole idea of 'keep everyone afraid, and they'll consume.'  "   I've recently started to really think about the world we live in. When you're in college and you really don't know what you want to do with your life you start to question everything you do. It's really frustrating. In another 3 years i'll have a degree and be out in the real world. god i'm 19 years old and i don't know what i want to be. actually a lot of people my age don't know what they want to do yet so blah. The whole time i was in elementary, middle, and high school, i always knew that i would have to make a lot of huge decisions in the future. now here i am.  make the choice bob . you're in college. pick a major. i'm majoring in math. become a math teacher? i know i can do better than that. i'm thinking about the FBI. i'm really thinking about the FBI. maybe i could be an undercover calculus teacher like Arnold in Kindergarten Cop.  "Who is your daddy.. and what does he do?"  ok he was a kindergarten teacher, but still.. I really gotta look into this.. "After you’ve been accepted by the agency, you’ll train at the FBI academy on the US Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia for 16 weeks." hopefully none of the tests require swimming because i will drown...  Only three classes to go and the weekend begins.. it's going to be incredible.. have a smutty weekend because  SMUT  will.. 7 more days  :-P  - R w L super SMUT

      And this will be the last time, We'll be friends again. I'll get over you and you'll wonder, Who I am. And there's this burning, Like there's always been, I've never been so alone, And I've never been so alive, I go home to the coast. It starts to rain, I paddle out, On the water Alone, Taste the salt and taste the pain. I'm not thinking of you again, Summer dies and swells rise, The sun goes down in my eyes, See this rolling wave, Darkly coming to take me, Home, And I never been so alone, And I've never been so alive.

      yo heres darin with a few words:  Today we had our first lax scrimmage. i played like shit, but i stuffed a black kid on the crease who was talking mad shit, and i went right up to him and was like "where you at bitch" at the top of my lungs. It made me feel good, especially since he was talking mad shit. then one player on the team, Kieth Campo, was supposed to get off the field, but he got in a bind on the field, and wound up getting leveled. And coach grasso goes, "you deserved it dumbass, next time listen to me." everyone was histerical laughing cause it was probably the biggest scumbag thing to do/say. I have a scrimage on saturday morning, then after that, im going up to albany with reza for a fun filled evening of fine food, fine drinks, and hopefully fine bitches. i dont have a fake id so i dont know how far ill go, but its all good, ill just bring a bitch back to the room.   Ahh, bitches in bed..... peace nigs

      Yoooooooooo fellas!  Today was one of the nicest days in a while: 60 degrees, full sunshine, a cool breeze. I just got in from playing some frisbee in the field with Bob.....it feels nice to finally be able to go outside for reasons other than walking to class.  After a LONG wait we finally got our housing registration done. We went down to register this morning and waited in a miserable line for at least 2 hours. Word was going around that the only housing left for freshman was Alumni Quad (which is about 3 miles downtown). However, we were really lucky that we registered early because..........we were able to get a 6-person suite ( with its own bathroom ) on  STATE QUAD in Fulton Hall, Suite 306 . One of the last 6-person suites available on the uptown campus. If we wanted to stay on Colonial Quad we would have had to split up our suite and we would have had to share a bathroom with the rest of the hall (boooooooo). So I guess we REALLY lucked out as most of our friends are going to be stuck downtown on Alumni Quad next year.  Aight fellas. I'll see you all in a week in a half for Spring Break before I go to Florida!!!! And I'll see Darin and Reza when they come up this weekend!! Anyone else who wishes to come, speak up soon!!  -BIGsmut

      yo it's chris...  my weekend was good, friday we had no school, so i hungout with my ladyfriend all day (which is always good).. saturday i hung out with the SC and we saw dawn of the dead.  i liked it.  i wish the ending was different.  the zombies are faster than the zombies from the original (which makes it more scary)!  the smee is always a funny person to have around, the smee is fun to have around.  we officially nicknamed the ford taurus; "the auto smoo"..  so now refer to it as the auto smoo.  not much else happened saturday besides the mall..    then sunday, i woke up, went to eat pizza at vito's with danny (where pappa's pizza used to be).. i'd rate that pizza a 6/10.. there's no more good pizzarias around anymore.. i miss the one that used to be at samsondale's, before the three brothers came.. the only pizza in our area that i would recommend now is "victor's".. which is located on bridge street/202 across from the super shop.  i don't like pizzas that are too acidic from the cheese, or have a weird cheesy taste.. to me, a good pizza depends on its sauciness.  i say, a saucy pizza is the right pizza.  pizzas with very thin crusts like cicero's and former patricia's suck.. why do you think everyone likes dominoes so much?.. because their pizza has a thick crust, is very saucy, and is abundant with toppings..  vincent's needs to put more pepperonis on their slices.. when i order a pepperoni pizza, i don't want 4 pepperonis.. i want 10 or more!..  but nonetheless, vincent's owns all of your gay pizza shops!  enough of my rant on pizza though..  danny left after pizza, so i tried out the tae-bo tape i bought..  apparently it's a new tape, it's tae-bo cardio.  the basics tape i did in gym class was a lot easier, but i'll get used to it the more i do it.. maybe i'll order the basics tape online first.  also, i changed around my room a bit; i won't go into details, because most of you know i'm not about details, so if you wonder how it looks, just come and see for yourself (with notice of course)..  hmmm.. what else.. then i showered and ate and hung out with my girl again, and then i had to do an accounting test which mr ahle e-mailed to us since we didn't have school friday..  apparently it's been a theme on the blog of how much rockland bores everyone to death and how people would rather be swallowing buckets of paint instead of being here..  but i don't think it's all that bad.  we're better off than a lot of places if you actually travel and see what else there is for you in, let's say, new york state (minus the city and albany).. i couldn't think of another place that's comfortable to live in.. we have the palisades center, that mall spoils us.. compared to any other mall in new york, it's better.. hmmm.. for those of you complaining about rockland.. go move to orange county, and take away your driver's license (if you have one) for the first few months living there..  i like where i am right now, i have everything i need.  for me, a highschool student, life is good right now..  anyways, i'm out..  appreciate what you have now before they get stripped from you, which they will as time goes on

      I'm going to try my best to bring you guys my haze of a weekend...  Went to Physical Environment class 1220 pm on Friday because the professor said that he's going to teach something that's going to be on the test, but it's not in the book! It was about adiabatic warming/cooling.. really easy bullshit. Then was sociology of gender.. he posted the grades, but me and a few other students grades weren't on there so i emailed the professor and i haven't got a response yet..  i'm about to open up a can of whoop ass because i want my fucking grade .. then at 330pm i had a calc 2 exam on chapter 8.. techniques of integration.. i'm placing bets that i got an A on it.. i actually think i got over 100% because of the bonuses. I didn't finish the exam until 520pm.. but after i was free to do whatever the hell i wanted...!  Ate dinner with the guys at about 6pm and we all decided we were going to chalk our IDs and go to Paulies.. At about 7pm we get a call from Josh saying that he wasn't allowed in.. Josh's chalked ID is a quality job.. apparently Paulies and the Post were going to be raided that night so they were being stingy with letting ppl in.. Plan B.. BEER AND LIQUOR RUN.. Jeff makes a few phone calls and finds a hook up.. We make some more phone calls and develop a list.. a huge list of liquor and beer totaling at a little over  $200 worth.. this would be the most expensive run in the history of runs up here .... this kid mike went to the liquor store right before it closed at 9pm and then picked us up to get the beer so me jeff and erek got into the car and head over to Hannaford.. i told the guys that we can't go in with mike because they are all going to ask us for ID.. but they didn't listen.. we all head over to the beer section and start packing a shopping cart full of beer. i run off and pick up some toiletries and when mike goes to check out the clerk said he saw mike walk in with other kids who need to show ID.. so we left Hannaford and went right across the street to Price Chopper and did it right this time.. we drive back to campus and meet 5 other people in the really shady part of the parking lot.. i stuff my 30 pack of Busch into my blue duffel bag, we all take what is ours and make a run back to all our dorms.  $200+ BEER/LIQUOR RUN COMPLETE.  to celebrate me, jeff, tom, erek, and kev crack open our bottles of beer or liquor and start drinking immediately!! a couple beers later i head up to 21.. where the entire floor is partying..  i literally had 4 suites to choose from to party in .. i played flip cup with people i've never met before.. we all introduced ourselves but i can't remember their names if you paid me.. we had some karaoke action in one of the rooms and i was singing something i can't remember the songs i was singing but i was sipping on two beers at a time, one in each hand.. then i go back into erek's room and supposely RA's (Residential Advisors) are on the floor busting people for open containers and being loud.. a few people got written up but not us.. what the fuck why were the RAs being such dicks that night i don't know.. i didn't get written up for shit so i'm fine. everyone quiet down for a little bit.. and everything after that was swell.. i got really drunk.. i also took a couple hits of the bong.. i was fucking spinning in my bed that night.. i slept well too  Woke up Saturday afternoon at about 4 pm. i felt well rested.. so i felt really good.. took a shower and got dressed and went to the campus center for chartwells over albany.. while me kev and erek were eating we notice these two girls on the line who were definitely on something... this chick was touchy touchy and laughing with a lot of people and then she got all scared and her pupils were dilated and she wouldn't stop laughing..  she was on SHROOMS .. it was very amusing.. as previously blogged when we all got back to the dorm  we all suffered from food poisoning      : (    i felt like shit.. and nothing would make me feel better other than BEER...!!! Started drinking at about 7pm.. sometime in between kevin from the 20th floor blazed me up and then i drunk more and we all played beer pong and battle pong.. it was a pretty dry night because a lot of people went out and a lot of people were shaken up for being written up the night b4.. oh yeah.. club 21 got written up SATURDAY MORNING.. RA's walked in and saw open containers everywhere... Josh's friend Dan from Cornell told us that he got 20 hours of community service for smoking trees.. up here in Albany we get 3 warnings before they do anything.. anyway it was a fun night...  Woke up this morning at about 3 pm.. showered got dressed and kev, erek, jeff, and I drove to the mall. We went into American Eagle and i couldn't help myself.. i was only supposed to get sandals but i ended up getting a couple shirts too.. I also put in an order for my SMUT hat.. i gotta pick it up tomorrow. it was so much fun.. i'm so used to being in college with kids about my age all their for school and drinking and whatnot.. i haven't been out in public like that.. like the mall in a while so we were all loud and rowdy.. i was also "cracked" out from the previous night so being in public kinda freaked me out. i miss having a car and driving around.. but i love the college lifestyle.. we only have 5 weeks of school left! i really am going to miss Albany and everything this place is about! i feel privileged to be going through this experience there are so many people out there whos lives really suck ass... my life is nothing but studying for easy bullshit classes and then partying like a fucking animal.. it's crazy  i am not taking this experience for granted i love every second of it .. truely the best 4 years of my life.  I am done for now... have a smutty day as always...!  - R w L super SMUT

      yo whats good all  I usually dont talk about dreams cause i think its a waste of time, but last night, my dream was awsome. i was in the city going to carmines to eat ice cream (WTF i know). then, the mob like killed my family. so i got pissed and turned into this millionare vigilante (sorta like batman). So i go to this huge banquet hall with the black guy from oceans 11 (were gonna be in barney... RUBBLE? ... TROUBLE!), we get these huge guns (augs and m-16s with grenade launchers), and we go in and fuck the mob up. then i woke up to the reality that i live in rockland county, and that i will never fuck the mob up with a cool black person with a british accent. MAN I WISH I LIVED IN DREAMWORLD sometimes, cause i would f hott bitches and kill mobsters like it was my job.  PS, i watched the sopranos and "point break" where they do a drug bust before i went to sleep, so i think it affected my dream. None the less, it was awsome.

      Ughhhhhhhhh........Earlier tonight me, Bob, and Erek went to eat dinner at campus center. Halfway through eating we started to feel like crap. I felt an impending shit coming on so I ran back to the dorm and unleashed hell on the toilet. One minute later Bob is furiously banging on the bathroom door so I had to pack up camp prematurely. Erek experienced the same problem. Food poisoning without a doubt. As I'm typing this, Bob just ran into the bathroom again. MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON OUR SOULS!!!  -BIGsmut!

      Aright, me and reza are coming up next saturday afternoon... i promise. no more swim meets, no college shit, no lax, just me, rez, and [SMUT] Albany.  Ok now that i got that out of the way, i want to admit to something. For the past couple of weeks i have seriously been thinking about doing coke. I know I lead a small anti-drug campaign and all that stuff, but i always wanted to see what it was like, what everyone was getting so excited about. But tonight I will tell you that I will NEVER EVER do it, and im glad I NEVER did it. For the high that you get is totally not worth the bullshit in the end. Im not going into details so dont even ask me, but I will tell you that one of my friends needs to produce $150 by the end of tonight or else he is going to get his ass kicked. And believe me, the people that are going to be doing the beating are quite big and scary... people who you definitly dont want to fuck with.  GOD that is so scary, the fact that people will go to your house to kick the shit out of you becuase you did something you shouldnt be doing in the first place I hope thats a lesson that goes to everyone Darin

      What up smutters?  After coming off of a several-hour studying binge for a Chemistry exam tomorrow, I've started to realize this semester has been a shitload of work so far. I guess taking Physics II, Chemistry, and Calc II all in one semester is really pushing the limit. The overburdened workload of 6 classes in one semester is really taking its toll on my free time. Oh well, by next year all these stupid prerequisite courses will be over and I can finally start chipping away at my major. I'm looking forward to all the atmospheric science classes that Albany has to offer.  Errrrr...all of my favorite bands from the 90's are getting dropped from their record labels!!! Just a little while ago I found out that RCA records dropped Eve 6, one of my favorite bands from the late 90's. RCA also dropped Lit sometime last year. I fear that Third Eye Blind is next (which really pisses me off since their last album was great). It seems that most people listen to shitty music like Linkin Park or [insert name of shitty Linkin Park ripoff] these days and alternative-rock never gets the recognition it deserves.  -BIGsmut.  P.S. Come visit us!!!

      WHats good fools  This weekend was pretty awsome. thursday night i saw starsky and hutch--- histerical, just histerical. saturday was super cool. had lax practice in the morning, where i owned not only jv but varsity in goal... its bad though cause we are going to get destroyed by other teams. Later on, i was in the st patty's day pareade in peekskill (across the river) and i drove kevin mcbride. it was nothing special, except hes the IRISH BOXING HEAVY WEGHT CHAMPION. he was mad cool, and supposedly he will be fighting mike tyson in his next match. i hope he wins cause he is that MONEY. i then proceeded to go to McGourty's house and i drank quite alot, but i felt sick so i stopped. they had a beer png tourny working, but it was really gay. the table didnt even go up to my knees, and the team that was winning leaned SO MUCH: i mean their chest was over the table. i couldnt complain though, cause the guy was a second leutenant in the marine corps, and he would have killed me six times before i hit the floor. i wish i stayed home though, i got alot of calls from alot of people and i wish i was with them than with people i dont know. today was the swim brunch. it was probably the best one yet, even better than the first one i went to. it was really sad because today was the official end of the alliance era (me bryan doug- connor graduated last year)but i am glad its over. later on ill post about stepping stones and life and all that good stuff, i need to get that off my chest. maybe everyone should do it especially after bobs inspiring speech (which i read from beginning to end, and i completely agree) until i spill my guts in the next post farewell Darin ps. Kevin mcbride is awsome, when we drove (at the parade) by irish people, he would say "erin go braugh, ireland forever!" when we drove past spanish people, whe would say "hasta luego!", and whne we would drive by black poeple he would go "yo yo yo gangstah!" and he would scream it loud. usually i would be afraid, but i was with him, i was really hoping there would be a fight...

      I'm going to try and recap my weekend...  It started Thursday night at around 9pm when i finished my calc 2 take home quiz. me, big smut, and jeff took some shots of peach schnapps and whiskey. then headed up to club 21 where the game of the night was flip cup. played two or three hours of flip cup.. i wanted to stop because i was getting too drunk but i was "forced" to play. I somehow made it to my 1220pm class the next day..  Friday i had 4 coronas on an empty stomach. i played holdem against james.. he had the same hands a few times it was fun.. won 2 games... and then lost 2 games.. drunk some more.. had a lot of fun..   Last night was a chill night.. i didn't drink because i had no more alcohol.. i played a lot of Mario 3 in the girls' room... there was a huge game of flip cup.. played a couple rounds..  a lot more shit went down..  that's a totally censored version of my weekend .. if you want to know the dirty details then IM me.. but i have to calm down with the offending posts.. i got called an asshole for my post of life  : (   Congratulations ANDREW on getting accepted to Albany.. you have to graduate high school first to get here.. so do what you gotta do and stop fucking around!!  Have a smutty one!  - R w L super SMUT

      That was an insightful post on life, supersmut..  I'm sure someone got something out of that.  Anyways, my high school goal has been achieved, and I have made Top Twenty.  Although I barely made it, at #20, I am still glad for myself.  However, the fact that I came in barely at number twenty has made me learn a lesson; and that's to give something your all from the start.  Although my highschool goal to make this list wasn't until 10th grade, my 9th grades could have been like the rest of my high school carreer's grades; better.  But still, I'm not complaining.  Congrats goes out to Solid Smut, who achieved the #6 GPA of our class.  And congrats to Jena, making the #2 spot.  I forgot what else I was going to say, oh well.. Goodbye.

      Now that we’re all a little older and actually are being put out into the real world we start to question the world that we live in. Why do we question life, the meaning and purpose of it? If we fully understand why we’re here does that mean we have an advantage over someone who doesn’t? Does answering these questions give us total power to control our lives and those lives around us? Maybe there is no answer. Maybe we do have a purpose. Maybe we’re just here because we are. Aren’t we just all made up on the same things? Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen? We are drinking water that’s been recycled for millions of years. We are made up of the same compounds that have been around for as long as time. Ok so we’re made up of elements so what. But, WE ARE HUMAN. We do have a conscious brain, we think, therefore we are. We invent things and live on new technologies. We have emotions, we live and interact with other people. We are sociable. Let me just get down to it. I’m tired of people complaining about life. I love life. We have so much to live for, some of you people are just so caught up in your selfish little minds and raw emotions that it makes me sick.. The moping and complaining and sorrow has to stop! Yesterday someone went up to me and said something about a sick family member. Yes I was sympathetic for the kid but I’m tired of this kid complaining about stupid shit that happens in his life. I’m sorry that’s what happens in life… people come, people go, people are born, people die, you get sick, you get well, you eat, you sleep, you wake up from a good night of sleep, you wake up from no sleep, you get older everyday, you lose your innocence, you drink, you get drunk, you hookup with people , you vomit, you pass out, you get stomped on, you wake up with a hangover, you go to school, you get good grades, you make the top 20 or you don’t, you get bad grades, you fail, you achieve, you feel good, you feel bad, you feel accepted, you feel rejected, you feel like shit, you get excited, you get bored, you get tired, you get hungry, you eat, you feel fat, you workout, you get strong, you get buff, you shower, you shit, you piss, you shave, you get dirty all over again, you have sex, you wear a condom or you don’t, you bust, in her ass cunt mouth face hair tits wherever you want or wherever it ends up, you get a sex partner, you start a relationship, you cheat, she cheats, you break up, you get back together, she cheats some more, you break up again, you get your license, you drive, you crash, you cry, you get a job, you get money, you buy whatever you want, you save money, you spend it all, you buy clothes, your clothes wear out, your clothes suck, you get new clothes, you flirt, you hookup even more, you get led on, you get heartbroken, you laugh, you cry, you make friends, you lose friends, you go on vacations, you get tan, you lose your tan, you get robbed, you get arrested, you get punched in the face, you get your car vandalized, you slip, you fall, you do drugs, you crash, hard, you get addicted, you come off an addiction, you get addicted to something else, sex, you feel like shit, you live you learn, you love, you care, you question life, you question if this is all that it has to offer, you’re in college, you’re going to get a job soon, you’re going to fall in love, have lots of sex, have lots of kids, then what, go on vacation, buy an expensive car, get your dream house, be happy? Really happy? Get a divorce? Stay married, till death do us part?  ^ ^ THAT'S LIFE. Sure life for a lot of you sucks balls. You’re in Rockland. Do whatever it takes to get the fuck outta there! If you’re not in Rockland and life sucks ass. Stop doing drugs, they really make you depressed when you don’t have them. And if life still sucks for you go to a hospital and look at all the people who are dying. They are not all old people. And if that doesn’t work climb to the top of a mountain and enjoy the view. Nature calms me the fuck down and the thin air will give you a natural high. And if that doesn’t work masturbate until your genitals fall off. And if that doesn’t work read a book, watch a movie. Or go do some stupid random shit, like start a small riot in the mall. Go a little crazy. See how much you can get away with. Pretend you’re crazy. Drink and be merry. Stop complaining. Life kicks ass. I love every second of it. When some shit happens to me I don’t give a fuck. This is what I live for. This is why I am alive. I have it better off than a billion other poor ass mother fucking 19 year olds. And so do you.  I’m done mouthing off. If you’re offended in any way you can suck my balls. I will enjoy it.  Have a super smutty day!  - R w L super SMUT

      This is  my  recollection of the [SMUT] party..  Well, actually I remembered most of it because I wasn't as messed up as Reza.  I arrive there around 10:00pm, after Lauren and her friends' plan of having a surprise party for Bob was foiled by [SMUT] not going to the planned dinner.  Instead, when I got there, I see Reza passed out on the couch, and Bob's U-Albany friends Erek and Jeff in attendance.  All of the drinks were free, which was a plus for my cheap self; and since everyone was already drunk or on something..  I soon found out later that Dr. Smut was on shrooms, which turned out to be devastating..  He was very violent, and punching and throwing things; oh well.  All in all it was a fun night, except for the fact that my girlfriend had to leave kind of early.. But Danny was there, so that was a plus having him witness our absurdity; apparently he likes how I am so disrespectful when I am drunk... The downstairs is still kind of disorderly.  I want to move the computer out of here, but I don't know where I possibly could put it, so I might just not end up doing it...  Oh yeah, and I was sent to time-out 3rd period today in English; by a substitute.  Substitutes are dumb, and he had a grudge against me ever since I walked into that classroom.  Oh well, I hope I make top 20 on Thursday and that mumble-fuck sees my picture on some wall or yearbook.  Take that to what kind of person you thought I was, bitch ass scrubstitute.

      This is my recollection of the Smut party:  I get there and Erek and Jeff give me shots...they show me how to do it "Albany style" so I take double shots...Capt. Morgan and Absolute...10-12 shots later..I remember being in my car but I wasn't driving..Darin is..I open the door while he's driving..stumble out and puke...get back to bobs...get tothe toilet..puke for an hour or so...then I remember waking up at 6 AM...going home...puking as soon as I get there. I feel like a pile of steaming llama dung the entire day...I go to work hungover...get home frmo work and go to Bob's...adam k rod gong jenny bigsmut and chris....Nothing too interesting...I tried to get gong to speak Chinese so I attempted to entice her into it...this is how that went:  Me: Gong, speak chinese. Gong: No. Me: Say hello. Gong: No. Me: Samsung Gong: No Me: Hiroshima. Gong: No Me: Panasonic. Gong: No. Me: Mr. Vo. Gong: No.   Fun.

      whats good yall  tomorrow is a bring your own glass/shot glass event, and if you bring your own alcohol please bring enough to share, even if you dont share alot. i say bring your own glass/shot glass because im pretty sure bob cant hand out enough glass wear for everyone. i will be bringing extra shot glasses, but bring yoour own if you have one. also, ill give everyone 3 freeshots of baileys for carbombs and what not, but this shit set me back 40 bucks and i need a little profit... so say maybe a dollar a shot after? it will prolly be kicked after everyone gets thier free ones anyway but if not after that i need to charge (except bob and kev and jay, they are free all night). also someone needs to buy like a 12 pack or a 18 pack of guiness.. were going to be doing 3/4 pints for the car bombs so it will work out to be extra in the end but if we dont have it we cant to it. who ever buys tha guiness gets freeshots.  thanks guys darin

      You want a good college story? You got one right here.  Apparently someone went on a rampage in our building. They took a shit in the sink of the Cooper Hall public bathroom, clogged and overflowed the toilet, discharged a 10 lb. chemical fire extinguisher, and stole an exit sign. $150 in damage according to the flyers posted near the building entrance. The whole fire extinguisher thing is understandable (it happens alot), but who shits in a fucking sink? Yeesh.....whoever did it must have been REALLY pissed or REALLY drunk. I pity our building janitor who probably had to clean all the shit out of the sink.  -BIGsmut.

      Tuesday, 3/2/04. Night begins with people slowly getting drunk. Bong being smoked. $115 bong to be exact. ITS DAMN GOOD. Better then bobs.(sorry homes) so then people got really really really way to drunk. Now people begin to write on one another with permanent. It gets everywherem, including peoples teeth. Next thing you know a suitemate to remain unnamed gets a certain gravity bong from unnamed gentlemen. The suitemate then proceeds to spill said bong water all about our room. ah yes bong water.  it tastes like it smells..................................................................................................................................... .................................................................................................................................................................. .................................................................................................................................................................. ............................................................................................................... DELICIOUS  ( those dots took me almost 2 minutes to type, which is interesting because i could have just held the button down) more drunkeness. a suitemate kicks a certain person out of our "smoking den".  (apparently our suite is a smoking den) sounds good to me.  then me (evil badger) and jeff (flipmode420) started with the mozart.  dont question just experiance it once and ull understand.  night ends with drunk suitemate and girls being thrown out by willy "the asian sensation".  All in all this nite proves that if u take 15 shots ull be a drunk moron,  and if your not drunk you have a lot to laugh about.

      After many weeks of the winter doldrums, today was refreshing surprise. Under a warm sun, temperatures rose well into the 50's. The snowpack melted considerably, people were outside playing sports, and everyone in general was in a much better mood. The best part about spring is how layers of clothing begin coming off. Walking to class today, I saw some girls in tank-tops and I thought to myself, "Damnnn, where have YOU been all winter?!"   Springtime is great and it only gets better from here.  -BIGsmut.  P.S.

      hey, just thought i'd mention something cool i saw today.. i was walking into the supershop around 8pm tonight when I saw a person on a motorcycle/bike turn onto bridge street from 202 and speed down bridge street.  as he was turning, there was a police vehicle behind him that was following him, probably for a little while before that too, and the police car followed him onto bridge.. so the guy on the bike speeds away as if he's trying to escape from the cop, and the cop turns on his lights and sirens and chases him down bridge..  i don't get to see what happens since they escape my vision.. but after only being in the super shop for a few seconds, i decide to leave and try to find if the motorcycle guy got caught.. i turn left onto bridge and i don't see the cop car pulled over with the guy, so i figure he got pulled over further down the street... all of a sudden the cop car is coming from the opposite direction towards me with his lights flashing.. it turns out the cop lost the guy.. i was amazed!  that's the first time i've ever seen someone escape from the police, in person..  it was great, and i commend the biker.. he had to have outran the cops because i then drove through my street and back onto 202, and a different cop car was driving around with his sirens on, the back-up.. so i follow that cop car and end up on 9w where i see a few cop cars with their sirens and lights off..  it was cool, the guy escaped.. i figured he went into some woods or a garage or something.. six flags tomorrow.. 1

      good evening smutters, just an update on my life to keep this blog alive..   i decided to go to albany, it's a done deal.  I still don't know why I chose that school, I would have rather chose to go to a warm school somewhere in florida; oh well, i concern myself on how much college costs, and albany seemed to fit my cheap needs.  in english, me, grande smut, and tenacious smut (yud) are assigned to write a creative short story set in Shakespeare's time.  mrs bassani gave specific directions to follow and told us not to make it too unrealistic, but since me and kev and adam don't really care about our english grades, we decided to make it totally bogus about a man named God Zilla (son of Rod and Todd Zilla).  his enemy is the megazord and Lord Zedd.. and there's a whole lotta other dumb stuff in there, pretty funny. friday i'm going on a field trip to six flags for physics..  that will be fun, especially since i miss school.  we basically have to do about 30 minutes to an hour of lab-work which deals with the park's rides, and then we get to go off and do our own thing.  chris burgaleta will be in my lab group.  burguleta is such an amazing person to me.  i look up to him both literally and figuratively.  well, maybe just literally.  or maybe it's just because he can take such huge bong hits.  and whenever you make him laugh you feel good in the inside, like you're a really funny person.  i don't know. enough of my rant on chris. soon the college guys will be coming home; about two weeks.. that will be refreshing to see all of the guys together again, granted we all plan and get together.. not much else is new; i'm tired..

      Yo!!!  Fountain Day was insane.....There's no need to explain it - you've all seen the news clips.  Last Saturday night I went downtown with Karla, Emily, and Danielle to go to the Post (the most popular Albany college bar). We stopped by some sorority house to pregame before heading to the bar. I thought this was going to be a crappy little party but no, there were THREE KEGS, BUCKETS OF PUNCH, BEER PONG, AND TONS OF PEOPLE!!! I found a nice little spot near the keg and started pounding cup after cup. 6 or 7 cups later I was absolutely hammered and it was time to head to the Post. Along the way to the Post I lost the girls either in the confusion of the crowd or the fact that I was just too drunk to comprehend anything. I tried calling Karla but her phone was off. At this point, the buses were no longer running and the cabs are impossible to catch by yourself so I decided that I was completely fucked......I started walking (stumbling, rather) back to campus......the dreaded infamous 3 mile walk from the Post to uptown.......at 2 in the morning.....all by myself. I made it back to the dorm alive in about an hour or so but some point along the way I can remember some homeless bums/crackheads yelling at me as I was journeying along Western Ave.......that just made me run a little faster. An interesting adventure and a great college story, to say the least.  Finals are coming up and the semester is coming to an end........boy am I going to miss college.....  -BIGsmut

      whats good everyone  So today on the bus ride home from yet another loss, i turn around and i see this car following us. in this car is this old bitty... singing and dancing like a diva. i told everyone to turn around, and me and pat start dancing like a bunch of idiots. The lady got soo pissed. She got off at the following exit, after honking her horn and giving us the finger. I was laughing so hard.  The weekend was fairly uneventful... i learned that i need to keep my mouth shut once in a while (when under the influence or not). Im really tired of school and i dont want to go anymore, lacrosse is beginning to become a drag, especially since we aint winning like we used to. Oh well, maybe some muse will come and inspire me that there is a reason to get up in the morning.   farewell Darin

      This weekend was crazy. Thursday was fountain day and i was drunk at noon. The fountain turned on at 1215pm and it was pure madness. I went back to state and took 4 more shots of vokda and passed out on the lawn. i was awoken to vodka being poured on my chest. i had to go to class. i stumbled into calc. my professor asked jokingly to smell my breath. i uttered.. "ughh nooooo." i ended up passing out with face on desk 20 min into the class. i awoke and went to eat my first meal. then i passed out in my bed for 4 hours, missing at least 20 phone calls.  it was 9pm and i was terribly hungover . i headed up to the club, then we headed to mcdumpster. food didn't make me feel any better. i showered at 1am, felt better, the st. rose girls slept over.  friday was a ghost town. everyone was mia. i was feeling like crap from the previous night. nothing a little w&b couldn't cure. met with academic advisor to schedule for classes. the night life was dry. club 21 is falling apart thanks to the UPD and numerous referrals.  i had my 40 oz of malt liquor and everything was good.    last night we had a disco party. i was drunken and under the influence of THC.  I was dancing like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.  pictures were taken of me. it's only a matter of time before they are posted all over the tower by those stupid girls. we then ate massive amounts of food.  pictures and video from fountain day: http://www.albany2go.com/livinghere/fountainday2004.asp  Give me smut, and nothing but!  - R w L super SMUT

      whats up, i just got back from the cheapest game of lacrosse ever  it was one of those games where the opposition hits you for no reason, and when you hit back you get the penalty, or when they hit you and they get the penalty, they complain how the refs suck.  and it wasnt even the players (even though there were three that im prolly going to follow up on and find out where they live), but their coach. their coach is notorious for creating cheap players and teams that win not because they worked hard or becuase they have talent, but because they are little scoundrels. NUMBER 9 IM HUNTING YOU DOWN.  on a lighter note, merchant marine was awsome, and there were actually girls there too!!!!. as a plebe, your not allowed to go out until the end of september, but after that, on saturdays you get leave from 12 to 12. thats 12 hours to do whateveryou want. im prolly going to come home once a month if im able to. but whenever your home, go into the city and ill meet up with anyone and chill... thats prolly beter than staying in a parking lot in north rockland anyway.  thats all i got to say, take it or leave it darin

      What's up fellas. I hope everyone who came up to visit this weekend had a good time. It was definately an interesting weekend up here. Bar fights, thefts, stripping, crazy bus/taxi rides, and extremely drunk people. Good shit. That's what makes Albany so great; you never know what to expect when you mix alcohol, girls, and raging harmones together.  I was looking through the hit counter for this blog and I cannot help but point out the kind of search queries that this blog is getting. Here are some actual search queries for this blog:  "nrhs tits" "kid with downs wins the race even though he stood in place" "milf bryans hot mom" "thursday night is ladies night at college bars on long island" "blog bitch fight" "terd in my backseat" "around his neck gold medals hung hanging on his giant tongue" "why karen like to pull andrew%27s cock and accidentally kick andrew%27s cock"  Hmm...interesting to say the least.

      good morning..  so i'm leaning towards going to U@Albany.. the positive aspects are: i will share the ford taurus (auto smoo) with my brother; enabling for easier access to getting back home to rockland, i won't have to go through the trouble of socially starting from scratch because i will have instant hook-ups from current albany students & friends i know who are going, albany pays for some of the expenditures because of the honors program (granted i keep my gpa above a certain number), it will be easier for my parents since both sons go to the same college.. and.. it's a party school!  So if there is anyone who grossly disagrees with this college choice, IM me at cjl906.. or if you support my decision, IM me too.. i should send in my letter or whatever saying i'll go by this week.. so these few days will be the last (insert noun(s)) for me to be sure.

      Spring break was very fun! Didn't get a chance to blog all week so i'm going to summarize what happened.  Thursday: drunk two forties of st. ives and  got really drunk , played flip cup, oh so drunk, stopped fan blade with tounge, assisted karla in the bathroom, cooked tater tots, couldn't eat without ketchup, got ketchup with ericka, karla called me back and said some guys were following her, came to her rescue, she showed me her room and stuff, passed out on bed.  Friday: woke up at 10 am with headache, walked back my room, had an exam in soc of gender, and a calc class. dad and diana picked me up. got home at about 8 pm. went out to chili's with SMUT. went back home and  blazed  a little bit.   Saturday: during the afternoon me and chris met up with tom, erek, jeff, and derek and i drunk a 22 of bud ice and we smoked a blunt in the mall parking lot and some guy parked next to us and started to talk on his phone so we drove around the mall and finished the blunt. went into the mall and i ate 2 meals. picked up the girls and chilled.. then  smoked a blunt  off of exit 14.. then chilled at my house.  Sunday: picked up the girls and we chilled. we were madd bored so we went to see a movie.. me and jena saw half of "Jersey Girl" but the other girls got bored so we left the mall. and went back to my house and  baked out my room  with the last of my tree.  Monday: nick picked me up to get a new bowl. we picked up the girls from the mall and they stole me some shirts and i gave nick one for picking them up. bought a new bowl and went back to my house and watched texas chainsaw. i dropped the girls off and nick came back. we went bum hunting.  we searched dumpsters and alleys for bums . we didn't find any. i think i chilled at pat's house that night for a bit.  Tuesday: happy birthday reza. darin was kind enough to drive us around on shrooms. we first went to get tuxs for prom and then we went to the 4d theater. we got in the car and then i was tripping so hard i didn't know what was going on. we picked up juli and went to austin's. i briefly saw some ppl while i was tripping. then in the corner of the room was a kid i didn't like. i was in no shape to fight, i feared for my well being. if i was sober i would have stayed and opened up a can.. but  i wasn't sober . we left. went back to my house and chilled. i love shrooms.  Wednesday: me and the guys played basketball and shit at farley. after we went to hoyers and then we went to hOOters. then we chilled at mark's house. then  i snuck girls out of their house and smoked them up .  Thursday: took jena m out to a movie and dinner. we saw "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and then ate at Fiesta. The movie was too much like Vanilla Sky, i was outraged. But i had a really fun time with her. After i chilled at Pat's and this kid mike said he would smoke me up if i drove him to someone's house to pick up weed. he wanted me to drive to the house of the kid that i saw on tuesday while tripping hardcore on shrooms. he asked the wrong person. i left and went to sleep.  Friday: i wanted to drink and have ppl over. but everyone was at pat's. and everyone else was out with their girlfriends. and my girls were at the mall stealing more clothes. so i sat there madd bored on a friday at 6pm wishing i was back in albany. the only person home was lauren!! so she came over and we watched movies and chilled. i love lauren!  Saturday:  got really drunk . hungout with the girls and drove them home at 10.  i got upset because i trusted you would tell me the truth . i didn't drive drunk though. then me and chris went to reza's and EVERYONE was there. after we went to alex's driveway because little kids talk madd shit so we set them straight. then we chilled at my house. then i passed out.  Sunday: ate dinner with family and drove back up with kev. just finished doing 2 hours of calc homework and now i'm exhausted.  i left out ALL of the detail.. madd drama went down but i guess that's over with for now...  just friends right ? I have 4 weekends left up here in Albany. I'm going to make the best out of it!!  You can't lose what you don't put in the middle, but you can't win much either.  - R w L super SMUT

      Yo everyone, its darin, ready to reflect on the past vacation like i have done for other past vacations. The past week has been crammed full of events, parties, practices, sleeping, and other things i forgot or cant talk about, and North Rockland finally had a void of bad times, drama, and shit that no one wants to deal with.   To me, this week was like an awsome friday night... you know the one where you go out, have the best time of your life with your friends, get trashed, go home to your own bed when the nightly events are done, and you wake up hangover free ready for saturday night... yeah, it was that good.  I usually dont have good times at parties becuase i always think of things that will or can go wrong. But that didnt happen ONCE at any of the parties that pat had. I think everyone who was at pats this week should at least say thank you to him and give him a beer even if its your last the next time your out. Its not every day a person opens his door for you to walk in, especially for a week straight. I dont think ill ever be able to re-pay pat (or his brother for that fact) for the parties he had that lasted till 8 in the morning almost every day, the drunken coversations with the tke's, the fear and loathing quotes and smoke ups, the selection of bombs that i did too many of... then drinking and smoking right on top of it, and passing out on practically every couch in the house.  If there was one thing i realized this break was that everyone can have fun in north rockland, and that chillin with my friends (either under the influence or not) is worth more than anything to me. As a matter of fact, i think everyone realized that.  If you didnt have a good time this week, then im very sorry for you. like i said before, this weeks success could have been produced into a 'teen movie', cause everything was perfect - the beginning, the end, and everything in between. This is one week ill never forget  and no one had a camera the entire time  Darin

      whats up smutters Tonight as i come home from another cool chill party at pats, i realized something. i love women. i love being around them, love being with them, love talking to them, just generally love them. either checking out the ladies on the lax field, visiting them at their jobs, callin them up to chill with them, any case scenario, i LOVE them.   Ok now that i got that out of the way  Ten years ago today kurt cobain killed himself. even though the man had some seroious issues (and i think i was 7 at the time), i would just like to thank him for starting the grunge revolution, which gradually changed music into what it is right now. with out him, wed still be listening to some 80's rock band with the huge hair and glasses, and disgusting tight leather outfits. RIP cobain, you're a good man for what you did  adios amigos please, write some commentary on the types of women you love, or leave a little love on the cobain topic, you'll be a better person for it

       You can't lose what you don't put in the middle, but you can't win much either.   Last last Friday (5/21) was fun! jena and i watched one of my favorite movies (vanilla sky) and then Darin had a few people over and his neighbor had a keg party.  I ended up throwing a small party in his kitchen and played bartender for a while . I couldn't drink at all bc i was on antibiotics but i still had a lot of fun. last last saturday i had a rave and andrew and xavier did some freaky cross dressing, save it for halloween! last sunday night reza jay colleen and i had some bong action and then munchie action. last monday we played basketball and ultimate frisbee at farley. we had the crackheads vs the potheads. i was on the pothead team!  we lost in basketball, but dominated in frisbee, the sport that really counts!  it was great because lightning was crashing all around us as we played until it started to pour, so we headed to taco bell. fun day. tuesday i woke up late. i did some autoCAD work for the porch and that night me and reza and jay smoked some lavender. it was very relaxing. wednesday, kate came over and we played a lot of resident evil 2. there was a part  where i knew  crows would pop through the window and when they did i jumped and screamed to add to the effect. kate was terrified, it was a lot of fun! thursday night was the award ceremony at the high school. i'm very proud of my friends who received a lot of scholarships. Friday was fucking crazy. We all ate dinner at the outback, then i purchased  my very own FUNNEL , then i pretty much had a keg party. i got really drunk for the first time since dan's party! even though it got hectic for me, i still had a fucking blast. someone spilled beer into my keybaord  >:o  No more parties for a long time. I'm tired of cleaning up and i can't even enjoy myself most of the time. but still, it was fun and thanks everyone for cooperating when i needed it and thanks  mostly everyone  for showing respect for the party thrower. last night was wierd? me and andrew hung out at lauren's house with the girls and we ended up smoking and eating salvia. it's a leaf from a flower. look it up online. i don't think it had any effect on me?  i miss albany a lot.  i miss getting piss drunk, hooking up with madd girls, and not having a care in the world. i still am unemployed, i've been really lazy with that lately. i'm getting my wisdom teeth extracted on tuesday.. i have a feeling that i'm NOT going to be prescribed vicatin. i haven't been living up to some personal goals that i set. i wanted to read some books, but the book i ordered 3 weeks ago never came and i don't think it's ever coming so looks like i have to visit the library. i still plan on teaching myself more calculus. why? because i am a math major and i need to stay on top with that. i've been working out at least twice a week, but that's less than what i used to in college. muscle deterioration, yes : (   that's all for now i'll blog soon about my upcoming dental surgery.. until next time..  drink and be merry .. leave the drama home !

      For a lack of better words, today sucked balls. One of the worst days in a looooong time.  I knew this was going to happen, but why did it have to happen today? My favorite band Third Eye Blind got dropped from their record label. Fuck Elektra. In fact, fuck the entire music industry.  My dog got released from the vet today after getting "grass poisoning." You know how dogs eat grass when they don't feel good in order to make themselves throw up? Well apparently he was rummaging through my neighbor's yard and ate a ton of grass from a compost pile. Enough grass to almost kill him instantly (grass is toxic to dogs). He can't walk but luckily he still seems to be eating and drinking normally. I took him on a 4 mile hike the other day, he was perfectly happy, and now it kills me to know that he might possibly never be able to hike ever again...  Just as I was ready to start packing, my road trip to South Carolina got foiled. Un-fucking-believable. My friend who I was going to stay with needs to attend a funeral Thursday night and Friday in Atlanta, so that screwed everything up. I am so bummed, angry, and disappointed.....  Later I met up with Bob, Andrew, Nick, and Xavier at Bleachers where the lovely Kate Tooma hooked us up with free food and drinks. Talking with my friends definately made me feel better. I don't know what I'd do without them. Plus, Katie told me I might be able to go down to Seaside Heights with everybody for after-prom. Awesome!  I hope this weekend makes up for today's shittiness.  -BIGsmut :(

      What's good!  The past few days have been eventful; Darin and Bob each threw parties over the course of the weekend, both of which were fun. Thanks guys!!!  So I've been waiting all spring for a bad thunderstorm and yesterday my wishes were fulfilled. Around 4pm there was a wicked storm.....crazy lightning, high winds, hail....the whole deal. This time, a lightning bolt struck the trees on the next block, followed by one of the most deafening thunder rumbles I've ever heard. BK just informed me that his house was struck yesterday and his computer gave off beams of light during the strike. INSANE!!!!!  Wednesday morning I will be driving down to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to visit Justin at his school! It's 700 miles each way, about 10-12 hours driving. It's a LONG trip to do on your own but I have a feeling that it will be well worth it! Can't wait!!!  ...I'll be back Sunday, hopefully. See you all then!  -BIGsmut

      Ok... Girls are the most confusing being on the face of this Earth. I'm sure that most, if not all of guys will understand what I'm talking about. The first time I really talked to Bob was online when he was having a problem with his woman. It just seems like when you start getting really close they pull away. They rip your heart out of your chest and stomp on it. Doesn't it feel nice? I know that it's a part of life and that eventually everything will work out for the best, all that shit, but what about right now? I don't know about anyone else, but i want my last high school summer to be an awesome. I thought that a certain someone was gonna be there with me for the ride and then we would come to some kind of understanding when I went to college. Things never work out the way you want them to. All a guy has in his life is his family, his friends, and his car and most of the time you have a problem with 2 out of the 3. Don't tell me that everything will be alright, just tell me that you know a really hot girl that's looking for a vulnerable guy to bang and then never talk to again. Thanks guys.

       I wish i could live this moment forever..  I've been having so much fun lately that i haven't gotten a chance to post.. so i guess better late than never.. Thursday: took two final exams, said my goodbyes to everyone, packed up and drove home from albany. it took me forever to unpack and set my stuff up in my house. i was so hungry so lauren invited me over and we ate hot dogs and strawberries. after i went home and finshed unpacking and didn't fall asleep until 3:30 am. Friday: woke up at 630am and got ready to go to six flags. we had a disco, rave, and yatta in the car! six flags was so much fun.  i macked it to 13 year olds and they gave me funnel cake . and the best idea ever was the river rapids! Saturday: didn't get much sleep that night either. i went to my cousins gradutation party.. it was so funny watching a bunch of filipinos line dance to the cha cha.  that night i had a few people over. i drunk 4 beers and i was just so tired. me, nick, adam, and chris raved for a little..  alex pointed out my boner, i had no shame . i went to bed real early for a saturday night. Sunday: we played basketball and frisbee at farley. chilled at hoyers after that.. that night the A team and colleen got together for some  good laughs and good blunts . mike had one of the smuttiest stories i ever heard. the 22 yr old secretary! Monday: katie came over and we played video games and then we went to farley for some wiffle ball but there wasn't enough people so i  drunk a bottle of champagne  and we ate at fiesta. hung out at lauren's after that. Tuesday: slept till about 3pm and picked up jermaine's uncle's computer to fix. kate came over and chilled for a bit. we came to the conclusion that i am going to be  "disco bob" for halloween ! then i fixed two computers that took until 4am.  Wednesday: went hiking. me and nick mooned people. it was a lot of fun. went to pizza smut with the guys. good times.  I have a dentist appointment in 11 hours.. "we have to take out your wisdom teeth" is what i'm expecting to hear.. give me some vicatin then.. i've been lazy with job applications because of this wisdom teeth bullshit.. smutty weekend coming up.. my boy josh from college is having a triple kegger at his house friday night, can't wait for that.. and that's pretty much it.. need money.. must find job.. must work very soon..

      Wow, so much has happened since I last blogged.  Freshman year of college is OVER!!! Yep, it's hard to believe it went by so quick. I finished my last final Wednesday afternoon, and left Albany shortly afterwards. Packing was such a bitch; I couldn't believe how much crap had accumulated in the dorm since I moved in last August. Since I was rushed, I barely got to say goodbye to anyone, however I managed to say peace to some of my good friends in the tower. It sucked so much to leave, hopefully I'll get to chill with my Albany friends over the long summer!   Leaving college life behind was tough, but it hasn't hurt too much yet because I've been having a fuckin great time back home in Rockland so far! Let me recap:  Wed. night: After unpacking a little bit, Nick picked me up and we headed to the driving range. To our surprise, Jay was there along with 5 other people, along with Jon and Chris from Southcott. It was awesome seeing everyone....an excellent way to kick off the summer!!  Thursday: Woke up early and headed down to Nanuet to get a physical for my new job at Tilcon. It was fucking ridiculous.....they examined me like I was going into the military or something.....drug test, hearing and vision test, height, weight, etc. All that for a friggin summer job. Pfft.  Friday: Got a Bo-Bo at Deli Central then headed down to Six Flags Great Adventure with Bob, Andrew, Nick, Xavier, Ed, Matt Vega, Karen, and Katie, who all skipped school for Senior Cut Day at NRHS! Thanks to Katie we all got in at $25 each.....thanks so much! The park wasn't too crowded at all and after 5pm the park emptied and we hit up all the rollercoasters. At 7:30 we went on Medusa three times in a row without waiting in line. As usual we got some smutty rollercoaster pics! The park closed at 8 so we stopped off at McDumpster and drove back home, jamming to Bob's mixtapes the whole way (YATTA!!!!!!!). I, along with everyone else, got a nasty sunburn. However, my sunburn was the worst out of all; there is an outline where my sunglasses were, and the top of my head got burned too. Someone said I looked like a lobster so I gave them my best impression of Dr. Zoidberg from Futurama (I'M DOCTOR ZOIDBERRRRRGGGGGGGGGG). My whole face is just starting to peel. Sucks being Irish (we can handle our beer but not the sun). And when I got home I yacked twice.....there was something brewing in my stomach ever since I ate those butterfly fries at Six Flags.....comparing to prior experiences, it was definately FOOD POISONING. AVOID BUTTERFLY FRIES.  Saturday: Took a random road trip by myself (I've been doing this alot lately.....road trips are fuckin awesome, and worth the gas). I started off by driving up Perkins Drive to the top of Bear Mountain. There were alot of stupid city slickers as usual. And it was hazy so the view was obstructed. You couldn't see the NYC skyline. I then proceeded to drive along Seven Lakes Drive all the way to Greenwood Lake, and then I crossed over into Passiac County, New Jersey. I got so lost in New Jersey but my nifty road map bailed me out this time. After finding my way back into New York I headed home to go to George McElroy's keg party!!! This party was awesome....it consisted of people who graduated last year and the present seniors. I got to see so many people who I haven't seen since last June at graduation. There was a huge beer pong tourney and I caught a nice buzz. There was an impending thunderstorm so I bounced from the party with K-Rod and Adam and met up with the Southcott crew at Mobil On The Run. Talked with them for a while, and when it started pouring everyone went home for the night.  Sunday: Was gonna go bike riding with Nick so I pulled the mountain bike out of the shed only to discover that the chain was rusted beyond use. When I tried shifting gears, the chain would just fall off. So I scrapped the idea of a bike ride and drove up to Farley to play basketball with everyone instead. Went to Hoyers afterwards and then headed home. Later that night I went over to Bob's and chilled with some people that I rarely ever see anymore: Mike V, Littleford, Will, and Jay. I used to be good friends with them back in the middle school years so it was mad fun getting to chill with them again. We shared some old stories and caught up on the years we missed.  Good times!!!!! I thought I'd never say it but I'M GLAD TO BE HOME for once!!!  -BIGsmut

      Yo what up my fellow smutaholics, goatsex is comin atcha  So today i did a video for pat tonkin's resaerch paper on vietnam, and i played a drill instructor. It made me realise though that im going to be on the low end of the totem pole starting july 9th, and that isnt going to end until the folling july. iTs going to be my first year of college, and im probably not going to have any great party stories to tell, no "walk of shames" to brag about, and defintly no club 21 where i can chill with friends and do smutty shit. All my friends are going to be all the way in upstate new york (or at least most of them) having the time of their lives, the girl im obsessed with is going to FUCKING ARIZONA, and im going to a place where the only thing you do for four years is work. ITS MAKING ME SOO angry and CONFUSED... should i go to this place and forget about all my friends and make work and future my only concern, or should i go with those that never left me hangin before. I fucking hate this shit man. With less than 2 months left its making me reflect more and more on all the shit i should have done years ago but am only starting to do or understand now, like playing lacrosse last year, being more social and giong out in 9th 10th and 11th, being more rebellious, i should have stayed home last summer, etc etc. people say that they are going to be visting everyone, but i cant do any of that shit. people say that they are going to stay connected with everyone, but looking at my parents, they are only freindly with about 10 people from their high school. I cant just walk away like they did. The day july 9th comes is goign to be one of the saddest days of my life, the day i leave rockland county, my family, my friends, the house i grew up in, and all the memories i had here are going to be just that, memories  maybe im just depressed cause i look at my sister and see how much she is like my parents, how unlike her i actually had friends that went out of their way to show me good times, and now all she obsesses over is work work work at the age of 21  next time i post ill read this and reflect on it, maybe answer some of my own questions, and If anyone has any negative comments about this post, go fuck yourselves darin

       This is my last post in Albany.. until next semester that is!  I had a Sociology of Gender final exam on Friday. It was only 20 questions and I think I got all of them right. It was a beautiful day so after that I chilled outside on my bench and continued reading a book.  I fell asleep outside for about 15 minutes and the wind kicked in. I went back to my room and took a nap for an hour. Then at around 5pm me, kev, Zach, and Erek went to the bookstore downtown to return our books for beer money. I only got back $15 for the soc book and they wouldn’t take back the other two books because they “aren’t using them next semester.” Whatever. We then went hiking up in the Catskills. Erek and I were being “morons” by rock climbing and going into caves, which were off limits. Free rock climbing was such a rush,  for a few moments I feared for my life . But I loved it, it was soo much fun. I have a lot of pictures IM me if you want to see them. We then picked up jeff and went to taco bell for dinner. By the time we got back it was 9pm and I still had to shower and get ready to go to “The Post.” I started drinking at club 21 at around 930pm and we couldn’t find the funnel. We looked all over and it was nowhere to be found.  It was 1030 and I wasn’t drunk yet and I wasn’t going to the post sober because it’s very hard to drink there if you’re under 21. midnight came and josh found the funnel and people poured into the room. The party started. We all passed around two bowls and one funnel.  Everyone was fucked up . Me and james had a rap freestyle battle that lasted for an hour. The rhymes I spit weren’t very good, but it was so much fun. Left club 21 at about 4am and ate some food and passed the hell out.  Saturday night everyone was highly anticipating a call from Dan, for a double kegger at his house. 8pm came and no word. I began funneling beers with Emily, Karla, and Lauren Pot. Erek called me and asked where I was, I was in his room, where was he, in my room being bored. 9pm came and we all started making other plans to go out to the club because no one could get in touch with Dan. We improvised and use the white pages to get his home phone. He was fucking sleeping the whole time! So we wait a little while for him to arrive and then Andrew and Xavier show up. Dan finally arrives at 10 ish and we all pack into 4 separate cars and pull up mafia style to his house. Two kegs, one huge tent, about 30 people already there quietly drinking standing around.  UAlbany comes there and we start doing keg stands, flip cup, funnels and basically are loud rowdy drunk mother fuckers . We basically brought the party to life it was amazing. I did two keg stands for the first time ever. The first one lasted 16 seconds and the second one was only 6 seconds. Half the Albany crew left that night, I gave Lauren Pot my seat in the car and stayed there. I went back into the house and tried to get another rap freestyle going, but it didn’t happen. I passed out of the couch shortly after.  Sunday we drove back to UAlbany at about noon. I get back and Andrew and Xavier crashed up in Erek’s room. I discovered that the night b4  Xavier got pulled over in the parking lot and passed many sobriety tests . Funny shit. We decide to go to the international house of pancakes, but the line was so long we just decided to go to Johnny Rockets. It was very good but the bill came out to a lot more than we expected and it took forever to scavenge up the money to pay, oh well. The guys left at around 4pm and I did nothing for the rest of the day.  I’m going to miss the hell out of Albany. Freshman year here was by far the best time of my life. Here are some random good times: the first night we went to a frat party and got drunk, the second night here we went to a frat party and stumbled back home, the free keg beer frat parties with free lap dances from dirty ass strippers, the many many hookups, “the lgndry nite of lsbnsm in cooper 207”,  the godfather, 420, the $200+ beer/liquor runs, the mud slides, skipping class every morning, wake and bakes, endless games of flip cup and beer pong, the ghetto drug war, the tunnels on shrooms, fountain day madness, CS lan games, the night I drunk beer and straight whiskey, leaving psych class to vomit outside the lecture hall, my drunken birthday, robot dancing, ghetto dancing, running down 21 floors for fire drills, coming up with the nickname “disco bob”, Italian food night at chartwells, thong on the wall, winning two texas holdem tournaments up in the penthouse, you got that crack, the walk of shame, chocolate penis in the dining hall, committing felonies, I’m rick james bitch, dancing yatta, holdem holdem holdem, power hour, and there’s a lot more shit that went down but  I’ll always remember the nights I spent with the friends I’ll never forget!  I’ll see all you mother fuckers next semester in CLUB 306!!!!!!!  Everyone who is coming to Six Flags this Friday, meet at my house at 830 AM !  To my Albany boys and girls.. HAVE A SMUTTY SUMMER !

      Weekend was a blast:   Thursday: me and Lauren Pot smoked woodstock. chilled with drunk bitches (wiggervampire) ate food at 2am. stayed up until 6am watching Con Air.  Friday: me, kev, jeff, and erek went to student life to get information on starting Sigma MU Theta. She gave us papers and pretty much interrogated us about it. we didn't have the book. i think it's somewhere in my mess of a house. to start a local frat we need insurance.. costing thousands of dollars out of our pockets. to be a chapter of a national frat and go with their insurance all we gotta do is pledge and we can start our own. jeff did some work and we need 23 more ppl to pledge with us next semester for Pi Kappa Phi. once that's done we have Sigma MU Theta. there's a lot of other details and it's going to be a fucking pain is the ass, but it will be worth it.. way worth it fellas. That night i funneled beer for the first time. it was great. we chilled at 21.. we tried to order $100 in wings, but someone sent a woman to do a man's job and we didn't get our wings. i was hungry, so hungry. ericka was so nice and hooked me up with some food  : )  we passed out shortly after eating and the next morning sheryl told me she took pictures of us sleeping at like 3am. wtf.  crazy ass girls.  Saturday: slept off my hangover and showered and got brunch. i read a book outside and passed out on the bench. there was chinese food in the campus center, it had devastating effects on me and derek. at night i funneled 6 beers and went out to Sneaky's with everyone. it was fucking amazing. louie devito, a popular techno guy, was the dj. i danced till i was drenched. it was the first time i did glow sticks and i think i did alright. this dude came up to me and gave me a VIP pass for raving. we left shortly thereafter because everyone was leaving at it was 3am. i showered when i got back and jac slept over. i said my byes to her this morning.. she's not going back to st. rose  : (  Today was boring as fuck. the internet has been down all day. my whole body is sore. I have 30 beers sitting in my fridge. I can't put them to use until Friday night.. I have a final Friday morning  : (   only 3 days of classes left and then 4 finals and then I’m done. See yall Friday may 14 morning for six flags!!  - R w L super SMUT

      What’s good...!  Today (Saturday) was completely random but definitely alot of fun. Woke up and it was a sunny 85 degrees – some of the best weather so far this spring. Deciding to take advantage of this weather, I recalled when my sociology professor from last semester told us about this really nice state park close to Albany that was definitely worth the ride, so I took his word for it, got directions off the internet, and drove there. One thing I noticed is how quickly you can go from urban to rural up here; you only need to go as little as 2 miles west of the city of Albany to find farms and open fields. Well in about 20 minutes I was at the park….it was fucking awesome. The park is at the northernmost tip of the Catskill Mountains and it consists of huge cliffs, waterfalls, lots of caves. At the top of the cliffs there is an awesome view of the Albany skyline, the Adirondacks, Vermont, Massachusetts, and you can even see the towers of UAlbany clearly. I took the trail that pretty much leads right along the edge of the cliffs and takes you under the waterfalls. I’ve been on a lot of hikes before but this one was definitely one of the best. I was also surprised at how many other college kids were there – I’m glad I’m not the ONLY one who enjoys hiking and getting off campus once in a while. Not to mention that hiking really clears your mind…  Tonight I decided NOT to get wasted so instead I hopped in the car and took a random road trip with Zach. We drove all over the fucking place, listened to some good music, and went all the way to Troy to go to “I Love NY Pizza” which has some of the best pizza you can find around Albany. $1 a slice – why can’t they have that in Rockland??? It looked like Troy had some pretty decent bars and clubs too….lots of college kids from RPI and Siena…..kind of like a mini-Albany.  I wish there were more weekends left in the semester to go on more awesome road trips like that. Not ONE drop of alcohol the entire weekend and I had more fun than most weekends!!!  -BIGsmut

      Stole this from somewhere.....  http://www.geocities.com/glengaryfan/index.htm     it's so true...  A year has past and now we stand on the brink of returning to a world where we are surrounded by the paradox of everything yet nothing being the same. In a few weeks we will reluctantly give our hugs and, fighting the tears, say goodbye to the people who were once just names on a sheet of paper to return to people that we hugged and fought tears to say goodbye to before we ever left. We will leave our best friends to return to our best friends. We will go back to places we came from and go back to the same things we did last summer and every summer before. We will come into town on that same familiar road, and even thought it has  been months, it will seem like only yesterday.   As you walk into your old bedroom, every emotion will pass through you as you reflect on the way your life has changed and the person you have become. You suddenly realize that  the things that were most important to you a year ago don't seem to matter so much anymore, and the things you hold highest now, no one at home will completely understand.  Who will you call first? Where are you going to work? Who will be at the party Saturday night? What has everyone been up to? Who from school will you keep in touch with? How long before you actually start missing people bargaining in without calling or knocking? Who will get breadsticks with you at three in the morning? How long until you adjust to sleeping in a room by yourself, or how long before you realize your three best friends aren't in the bed next to your room?  Then you realize how much things have changed, you realize  the hardest part of college is balancing the two completely different worlds  you now live in, trying desperately to hold on to everything all the while trying to figure out what you have to leave behind. In the matter of one day's traveling time, we will leave our world of living next door to our best friends, walking across campus to eat, instant messenger, 8:00 classes, and perpetual procrastination to a world that will seem foreign to us despite the fact that we have lived in it for nineteen years.  But it is different now... We now know the meaning of true friendship. We know whom we have kept in touch with over the past year and whom we hold dearest to our hearts. We've left our high school worlds to deal with the real world. We have had our hearts broken, we've fell in love, we've helped our best friends through the toughest times of their lives, something their even best friends at home couldn't be there for. We've stayed up all night just to be there for a friend. We've partied the night away, doing stupid stuff, but we were always there for each other afterwards. There have been times when we've felt so helpless being hours away from home when we know our families or friends needed us most, and there are times when we know we have made a difference.  A few weeks from now we will leave. A few weeks from now we take down our pictures, and pack up our clothes. No more going next door to do nothing for hours on end. We will leave our friends whose random emails and phone calls will bring us to laughter and tears this summer. We will take our memories and dreams and put them away for now, saving them for our return to this world.  A few weeks from now from now we will arrive. A few weeks from now from now we will unpack our bags and have dinner with our families. We will drive over to our best friend's house and do nothing for hours on end. We will return to the same friends whose random emails and phone calls have brought us laughter and tears over the past year. We will unpack old memories and dreams that have been put away for the past year.  A few weeks from now we will dig deep inside to find the strength and conviction to adjust to change and still keep each other close. And somehow, in someway, we will find our place between these two worlds.  In a few weeks.... are you ready?

           Today has been quite the eventful day for me. I will start with my trip home from the mall with my cuz. I was contemplating whether or not to take 303 home or the parkway. I decided that I wanted to drive fast so I took the parkway. While driving I was flying by the exits....10...11....What is this I get to exit 12 and just beyond that an SUV is turned sideways in the rode. The car had smoke billowing from the hood of the car and moments later the whole car was engulfed in flames. Tiny bursts of explosions were shooting off all over the place. Finally the Jewish Rescue Team called "The Heb League" came to escort their fellow Jew out of the burning vehicle. With curls flapping in the wind they ran down the parkway. It seemed as if the curls are of some radar detecting mechanism because almost instantly the parkway was covered with Jews. While all this was going on me and my cousin Daniel got out of the car and started playing Frisbee in the middle of the Palisades Parkway thus accomplishing one of my life goals. We even got an old man and a little Jewish boy with premature curls to join in on the fun.             After all this happened I went to Bobs to play a little Holdem. The first game I lost 5 bucks but the second game was my big come back and I won 35 dollars. It was such a rewarding feeling winning instead of losing which I am used to at this point. Well that is it for now farewell and until we met again.    Dr.SMUT

      Hello, Let me tell you a story about a person named Jay and Jay has noticed some thing different about himself over the past month or 2.  Perhaps its the fact that Jay has realized that in a few short months he will be turning 20 years old which means he is not a teenager anymore.  Which also means he has to stop snowboarding though life with no direction, and perhaps the only way to find direction is to find it yourself no one else can do it.  Self realization is the greatest thing someone can have, you figure that out and life becomes alot easier.  Maybe Jay has realized how to realize and by realizing this he may be on track to realizing himself.  And if he has truly realized himself then he knows that he will never stop realizing new things to realize about himself.     Ok, if you are wondering what the hell is going on i will try to tell you.  The reason I wrote it in third person is because it doesnt apply to just me, it goes for anyone who wishes to realize how to realize.  And if the the whole realizing part is hard to realize then you haven't realized how to realize.  Have fun trying to understand all this because to tell you the truth I have trouble too but that half the game, no one said it would be easy and no one can do it for you  --[SMUT4LIFE]--

      i would kindly appreciate it if the next time people are at my house during the night hours, that you do not freely discuss smoking marijuana, how often you drink, how blazed you are, how drunk you are, or any other drug references out loud.  you people don't know if i want my sister or mother or father exposed to any of that kind of discussion.. you don't know how loud a voice must be to be heard from downstairs, so don't ignorantly scream out your drug status.  how do you know if i want people in my family to be exposed to that?  just because i have a brother who doesn't care, doesn't mean i feel the same way. just because you may hear things about me, doesn't mean it's alright to assume that i think it's alright for everyone in my family to know about it.  it's called  respect , and if you want the free luxuries of this house that you can't get anywhere else at 1am, i suggest you start being respectful.  as god as my witness, if i find out anyone who reads this post and still disrespects my wishes, i will physically escort you out of my house myself.  it doesn't matter if you're my best friend, or a girl, you will be ejected from this house.  take my word for it.

       My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me..   What is good everyone. I’ve been having a blast:  Thursday 6/17: adam g and I chilled at darin’s for a bit, picked up jacki p and heather f and ate food at wendy’s. brought it back to the smut house for a small gathering. I drunk a few  beers  and ill will hooked us up with some phat bags.   Friday 6/18: jay, kev, and I drove to the shore and was one of the first ones there. We claimed a house in the name of smut and began  drinking . The night was short because everyone didn’t get there until 2am or so. Won all the flip cup games I played. The sun rose around 5 am and we all went swimming in the ocean. I fell asleep on the beach at 9am. It was a lot of fun. Good smutty times.  Saturday 6/19: chris drove us home at noon. slept all day. Got up, picked up the girls, drunk some  beer  and ate some chicken soup.  Sunday 6/20: graduation! Took a lot of pictures of the grads. Went out to dinner with the family. Drunk a lot at laurens. Went to katies party where she had 3  kegs . Everyone was there. It was a lot of fun!  Monday 6/21:  played a small game of ultimate Frisbee at north Garnerville, chilled at hoyers, played some holdem, drank a  beer , blazed with j fizzle, eat a lot of food  Tuesday 6/22: had a small smut party where I played a lot of beer pong, funneled a lot of mixed drinks and beer, had a piss drunk conversation with jena m, it was all a lot of fun until I  blacked out next to toilet at 11pm . I heard ppl were hanging outside when I was unconscious. I am furious!  Wednesday 6/23: I don’t know how I woke up alive at 8am. I didn’t want to wake up, God could have killed me from alcohol poisoning and  I would have died happy .. I was terribly sick, I didn’t stop puking until noon, but at 2 pm went swimming at laurens, felt 100x better, me and nick blazed in the car 3 separate times, barbequed food, bought tix for spiderman 2 midnight screening, went swimming again at 10pm, went back here and ran the table in holdem. Good fun times.  Wow I  drank six nights in a row  without even knowing it. I remember the DARE program back in middle school. Everything officer Williams said about alcohol and drugs is true. This sucks balls. I’m cracked out and I want to drink right now. This unhealthy lifestyle is starting to bug me.  I need a smart girl to keep me away from this shit ... I start work Monday, full time. Until then, stay smutty!

       Yes, I disappeared off the face of the earth, but now I’m back...   Hey what’s good everyone! Yeah the blog has been pretty dead lately, that’s because the smuttiest one of all hasn’t posted in a couple weeks!  I’m going to give a brief summary of what I did everyday, maybe you don’t care, but I like to look back at previous posts to see how my life has changed. Alright, here goes!  Sunday (5/30)  – woke up very late, watched the movie kids with alex, jena, and christey. They seemed pretty disturbed by the movie, I was too the first time I saw it. But the truth is the movie isn’t disturbing, real life is. Just watch the movie and you’ll know what I’m talking about.  Monday (5/31)  – had a few people over, watched matrix revolutions, and then blazed with Colleen, Jay, and Reza.  Tuesday (6/1)  – Got 3 of my wisdom teeth extracted! It wasn’t half as bad as people said it would be! I had a feeling I wasn’t going to be prescribed vicatin; the dentist gave me codeine instead. Boo. That night we watched Lord of the Rings at Reza’s.  It took me one hour to eat one slice of pizza!  For the next few days I couldn’t eat food that well  : (  Wednesday (6/2)  – went to bleachers with smut and played darts. I haven’t thrown darts in years and I think I scored pretty well. Drew and I purchased some  KY warming liquid  from A&P, good stuff! Vince then hooked me up with a bottle of vicatin he never used. That night I popped a pill and then took two hits from the bong. Vicatin taken 20 minutes before blazing multiplies the effect of both. We then got some fast food and pigged out.  Thursday (6/3)  -  played some Frisbee, played some tennis, went to hoyers, blazed, ate for free at mcd’s with smut, and then just chilled here.  Friday (6/4)  – played some more tennis, sneaked the girls out, got really drunk, don’t remember too much after that  :-P  Saturday (6/5)  – ahhh yes Zach’s long awaited double kegger for his sister’s graduation from Binghamton. It was a blast. We had a HUGE game of flip cup ALBANY VS BINGHAMTON! Yeah we lost the first game, but  won eight games in a row  after that! Then, I challenged some Binghamton student one on one with 5 cups and I mean come on, it’s a UAlbany student’s job to beat sorry suckers in flip cup! I stopped drinking shortly after that to sober up because I would be driving home that night. Zach smoked me up with the most delicious peach blunt ever. I also danced some disco and skinhead to entertain the locals! Overall it was an awesome time!  Sunday (6/6)  - Dr. Smut and I popped some V and blazed. Then ate a massive amount of food.  Monday (6/7)  – played some cracked out tennis with Dr. Smut. it was bad. Being cracked out sucks. Then Jermaine picked me up to set up a wireless network for his girlfriend’s mom’s computers. OMG.  She is by far the hottest mom I have ever seen.  While talking to her, keep in mind I was still cracked out, I pictured myself just banging her right then and there. I then came back into reality and realized that I had to do what I came there to do.  Tuesday (6/8)  – drew, x, and I went swimming in Laurens pool. We also barbequed some hot dogs and hamburgers and then just chilled.   Wednesday (6/9)  – I went to the barber and got a free shape up from Jermaine’s uncle, Hector, who works there. Went to jacki p’s for a little and swam in the pool. After, I got ready for a job interview with Vector marketing. I got the job.  Thursday (6/10)  – training for the job, what I do is set up appointments with people I know and then give a 20 minute presentation on kitchen cutlery. I make $15.25 for each appointment or get a 10% starting commission. Then we ask the customer to get us some referrals, easier said than done. Chilled with jay, kev, and nick that night. Didn’t smoke or anything, couldn’t be cracked out for the next day..  Friday (6/11)  – trained some more, made some appointments for the weekend. And that night chilled with the girls, had a bud ice to feel good.  Saturday (6/12)  – that was an awesome day. I had training in the morning and then a couple presentations that afternoon. That night Jeff invited me over to his sister’s birthday and he said I could bring a few people. So I got nick, jacki p, crystal, veronica, and alex over there. We drunk some  special punch  and played drinking card games. It was a lot of fun. We headed back over here and smoked some haze. While in the garage I felt a pinch. I look at my thumb and there’s a mosquito sucking the blood out of it. I go to smack it and it flies past my ear. I have never felt such hatred in my life. I hope that mosquito dies a horrible, slow, excruciating death. That night I slept like a baby and finally had a GOOD dream for once.  Sunday (6/13)  – had a presentation in the early afternoon, then I drove chris and nick around while they blazed, chilled at hoyers, got dirty looks from old people, why are old people so dumb, oh yeah that’s right cause they’re old. After I had a couple presentations in the evening made a couple sales and had dinner too with jeff’s parents!  Monday (6/14)  – had a meeting early in the morning, me and 3 of my co workers had to drive to a huge meeting in new jersey, one of my co workers, jon, on the ride down was like “yo you guys blaze?” word… he rolled a joint and  we went to the meeting blazed . It was the first regional meeting I’ve ever been to and I didn’t know what to expect. It was fucking insane, there was 300 loud sales reps all college students just going crazy. I was meeting new people and shaking their hands I had no clue what the hell was going on. People were screaming and cheering. New jersey sat on one side, New York sat on the other side. We were all chanting for our states and NY was clearly the winner. The company gives out a lot of recognition for people who do well, which is just about everyone who works with Vector. That night I chilled with a couple of the girls at hoyers. Lauren and I jumped into the trunk of the car, bounced up and down and got out at the perfect moment where people were walking by. Some girl actually said “what the fuck?!” I played it off like I was confused and got in the car and drove away. It was so fucking hilarious you just had to be there..  Tuesday (6/15)  – gave a presentation to mom and dad, they seemed impressed with the quality of the product and my presentation. After I went swimming at lauren’s and drunk some gin and juice. Then I gave lauren’s mom a presentation and then another presentation after that. That night a few girls came here and chilled. This chick Taylor fucking drunk a 22 of Smirnoff in less than 5 minutes and then started drinking MY beer! Very impressive, very hot.  I ended up funneling the rest of my bud ice . It was a fun night!  Wednesday (6/16)  – I quit my job for three reasons: transportation, recommendations are a bitch, and the schedule I had was ridiculous. We don’t get paid for training, therefore I’d have to be at the office at 10am for 5 hours of training and then let’s say I’d have a presentation at 4 and then my next one would be at like 8. I do nothing in between then but sit in my work clothes waiting around. Also, the only time I could present is around other people’s schedules, not mine. When I quit I had a whole nice letter of resignation that I prepared and read. My manager was trying to get me to stay by saying like “quitting can turn into a bad habit” yeah ummm okay and then he said something about quitting cigarettes so I said, “but you want to quit cigarettes?” and then he said something about challenging myself and I thought, there are a billion different ways I can challenge myself in this world. I can try and challenge myself by becoming a chemistry teacher, but I don’t want to do chemistry I want to do MATH. I really had a good time selling, I sold $1000 in kitchen cutlery in 5 days, the job itself was fairly easy, but I just couldn’t keep it because of the reasons above. And that’s that. And  here I am now unemployed by choice.  Not only did I give up a fairly decent job, but a great opportunity and that was learning a lot of skills that I’m not going to get into cause I’m real tired I haven’t got a full night of sleep in a week. So until next time… keep it SMUTTY!!

      Something struck me while I was reading K-Rod's most recent post in the Madden blog.  Let me share something relavent before I get to the main point: I hated my graduating class. There were no weekends where you just chilled with a group of 30 people from your class at someone's house and had a good time. You couldn't walk through the halls of NRHS and genuinely say "Hello" to all the familiar faces. Not once during graduation did I stop and think, "Damn...this is the last time we're all going to be together in one group ever again. I'm going to miss this class." I don't even look forward to seeing everyone from my class 30 years from now at a high school reunion. There was no sense of unity with the Class Of 2003!  Now this year's graduating class has such a great sense of unity. You're probably one of the tightest classes to walk through the doors of NRHS in a long time. Most of my friends consist of people from the Class of '04. Hell, I wish I'd been born a year younger so I could have graduated with you guys.  I only keep in touch with about 6 or 7 people from my class and sometimes I wish that number was more like 20 or 30. My best advice to the soon-to-be graduates is to keep in touch with each other and not let this awesome class just fall apart after everyone scatters into college at the end of the summer. You now have a golden opportunity to make life-long friends, why let that opportunity go to waste?  Last but not least......CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!

      Tonight I took a ride up to Kingston with the Southcott crew for a concert and the smuttiest thing happened along the ride up there. We harassed pedestrians from the van while driving through New Paltz, and there was this one fairly hot chick hogging the road with her bicycle, so we slow down next to her and John yells jokingly "THERE IS A SIDEWALK, YA KNOW"...as we're driving away, she lets go of the handlebars to blow John a kiss and by doing so loses control of the bike.....so the bike tips over and she goes flying off the bike right onto the sidewalk! We died laughing, it was the most hysterical thing to see a hot chick fall off a bike. I guess we're all going to hell now.  -BIGsmut

      Well i haven't blogged in an EXTREMELY long time but i think this is important. We need to assist Darin in enjoying these last days. For us we leave north rockland to go to college but we gain freedom and do what we want. Darin will be leaving North Rockland for merchant marine, where free time will be limited and when it is granted he'll probably still not be able to do anything he wants. We must make sure he spends all of his time left with a smile on his face.  I think we definately need to get some sort of beach house vaca. thing going, and also Darin, goodluck, because u MUST break that curse before you go....  Let us all make things [SMUT]ty for mister Rupinski in every way possible

      Nobody's blogged in over a week, you lazy sacks of shit!  So the graduating seniors have only a handful of days left before prom & graduation. I'm proud of you all for making it out of NRHS successfully and moving on to college. Lots of smutters will be making their freshman debut at UAlbany next semester; good times lie ahead for all of you.  I ran over a can of paint with the forklift at work today. Whoops. Big mess. Give me another week and I will have mastered the forklift!  I was going to say something else but it slipped my mind. Damn sleep deprivation.  Peace!  -BIGsmut

      hey whats up guys, its darin.  last time i wrote it was july 9th now its july 31st, and i believe i am a changed preson. my room mate is awsome, ive made a bunch of new friends, and i think that i finally found something that i think i like.  the thing about college is that all the people around you, no matter how different they act or look, are the same as you. For one thing, your all in the same place, doing mostly the same stuff. finding people to relate to is a lot easier than you think. So if your nervous or scared about leaving your houses and family and friends, thats good, its natural. but i garuntee that by the end of the first week you'll be living the good life. the transition from highschool to college is definilty a challenge, but if you take it one day at a time, it will be a whole lot easier.  PS: most of you guys are going to the same colleges anyway so you have nothing to worry about

Katie Tooma on all her accomplishments. Darin, I wish you the best of luck in the merchant marines. It always feels like there’s someone missing at smut gatherings. We all miss you Darin! Some German guy emailed me and wrote “The SMUT has reached Germany.” and pointed out a link to his “Team-Smut” paintball team.   urlLink  www.team-smut.de      funny ass shit. referring back to the “bad night”.. an attack to a smut member is an attack to SMUT itself. Your actions will not be tolerated. You know who you are and you’re probably reading this you fucking coward. The “Porno Bandits” a bunch of smut wannabes have challenged SMUT to a dodgeball game. SMUT has been playing 2 hour games of dodgeball in the past, all I need to say. It’s really disturbing to see how often I smoke. 90 percent of the time I get smoked up for free. Marijuana is bad. Real bad. i’m having an internal conflict with marijuana.. it’s not that I can’t stop. I started in October and stopped in January and really started again when I got home in May. With only 4 weekends left until Albany I think I’m going to really slow it down to the Sunday routine. And when school comes I HAVE to stop because drugs + school = low GPA. Also alcohol + school = high GPA it’s been proven read my previous blogs! One last thing I’ve said this a million times and I’ll say it again. Some people just need to learn how to have fun and control themselves when they drink. Alex got sick Saturday night and almost everyone started bugging out. I got pissed. Party over! Chill the fuck out seriously. Well it’s been fun., until next time.. drink and be smutty!

      It is official i no longer am driving the wagon anymore. I now have the sportier/not wagon looking like Ford Escort ZX2. It is better for the reason that it isnt a wagon but the only thing i hate about it is that it has 2 doors. 2 Door cars are so damn annoying. The plus to having this smaller car is that i cant lug around 9 ppl in my car anymore coming home from firework showings and passing about 13 million cops with a fear of being pulled over everytime. All in all i am very pleased with my new car the only thing i need to put into it now is a CD player and i will be set. I also want louder/better speakers in the car so i can really blast my music and make myself go deaf at a much earlier age.

      If any of you guys want or need to talk to me in the next two weeks, write to the following address:  Plebe Candidate Darin Rupinski, 2008 U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Kings Point, N.Y. 11024-1699  *Send in a white envelope only*  After the 25th I'll be getting my computer and I'll probably be able to talk via e-mail or AIM. Also, I'm going to get a box number. When that happens, I'll re-write the address, which is going to look like this:  MIDN Darin Rupinski Box # ---, USMMA Kings Point, N.Y. 11024-1699  Thanks guys. Until I post again, this is Darin wishing everyone a fun and awsome summer and an exciting and successful school year.

      So friday at the fireworks Bob and I are just chillen and he keeps asking "Wheres the bathroom" over and over so i told him and we walked over to it and there was an old man waiting to use it. The old man says "I have been waiting here for 10 minutes" so me and bob look at eachother and he said " Nick take off your glasses and give this guy a death stare when he comes out " so i do....and just as the door opens a [SMUT] member comes out of the bathroom laughing cause he heard me and bob getting annoyed about the wait. Then the [SMUT] member apologizes to the old man for the smell...all of us started to laugh hysterically then we went back to the heard of ppl to continue with our night

      hey whats up everyone, i just have to say something...  You know how when you go out and you dont come home until 2 in the morning?, and your parents are still up pacing back and forth, and when you get in they have both a sigh of relief and somthing to yell at you about? well i never really cared because i knew i was always ok, but now i know what they go through (at least concerning me.) it is one in the morning and my father isnt home yet. he at a bar with his friends across the river, and im very worried about him. im probably still going to sleep easy tonight, becuase in my gut i know hes ok, but i dont think he has ever come home this late. the gut feeling i have is beyond explanation. so, the next time you come home late and your parents want to yell at you about it, take it more as a compliment than as a question of your maturity: it shows that they care for you and would never want to see you hurt in any shape or form.   Later  darin

      Whats good fellas, just wanted to let you n on some stories. As a plebe you have to stand 4 hour watches twice a day every once in a while. One place in particular is know as the whack shack because when yu have watch there you usually do the deed. So my friend brought porn, and he got caught watching it! ive never seen a person do so many pushups in my life, it was mad funny. The night we got our computers i was mad tired, i was hot, and i was not in the mood for any bullshit. the man giving our computers though, could not speak a fucking word of english. so they were dictating all this important shit that was necessary to know, and i couldnt understand the dude. I was getting really pissed. Finally, i raised my hand and i go :Sir, i cant understand you, can you please repeat what the hell you just said!" now, this was in front of all the officers, all my classmates, and pretty much the staff that issued my link of this campus. i felt like such a DB. but then, after about 5 mins i didnt give a shit. I still hear it everyonce in a while though from people, and everytime i say i would have said it again if i had the chance. my last story is that on the dvd my friend was watching is a bunch of nude pictures of an upperclass chick that was taken for her boyfriend. she wound up cheating on him, and he took all the pictures, scanned them, and sent them to the football team, and they circulated it throughout the school! shes pretty hott too.  Just figured i'd let you know. if you have any awsome no rock stories of running over cats or throwing shit at old grandmas, please post them or email them to me, i can use all the entertainment i can get.  talk to you guys later
