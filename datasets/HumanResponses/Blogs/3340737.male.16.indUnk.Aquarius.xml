      Today is the biggest day for me! We would be doing MT 'O' levels  today! I woke up early and did some last minute study before going to school. I met Yazid and we went to school together. At school, we went to check our index numbers ans seating plan. I must admit that the paper was quite hard. After finishing all the papers, we went to L.J.S to have our lunch. We then went to Northpoint and walked around. Amirul, Yazid and Fauzi then stalked girls at Popular. After that we went home feeling tired and I posted this P.O.S... B.T.W..... HAPPY B'DAE SALIZzZ!!!

      Yesterday was a very tiring day for the student leaders who went to Yishun Choral Fest. When Yazid and I reached school, we met Farhan and settled our logistic stuff. We got scolded by TicoLee for making him wait a long time to get the walkie-talkies. After that, we got 'bugged' by 2 Sec One students who were Mr Sim's personal helpers. After settling all of that, we set off to Victoria Concert Hall. The security there was tight as there was an opening of Singapore Arts Festival. Farhan , me and another S.E.O set up everything upon reaching. We had a big problem as we did not know where to hang the blazers. Alas, the problem was solved and we settled everything by 5pm. About 45 minutes before the event started, we wore our Blazers and issued out the walkie-talkies. Everything went well until choir members from Northland Primary School(my primary school) started to wreck havoc during their break. Mr Shaiful then got pissed off and asked us to qiueten them down. The situation got worse when Mao Shen came. It became more noiser until the school teacher came and scolded them. We then got compliments from people when the show ended. We cleared up and returned to school. On the way, Mr Shaiful kept asking questions like "Anyone brought food with you?" and "Anybody got some snacks like chocolates?". Wow, what a hungry monster! We kept everything by the NCC closets and went home. I reached home at about 11.35pm, feeling very tired. I took a bath and slept... Today, I knew I had nothing to talk about,so I recalled yesterday's event... That's all!

      Today....is another boring day. Hmm, we have our MT 'O'level briefing and that makes me feel very nervous about this coming Monday. After that, during Math lesson, Mrs Goh let us study our MT instead of Maths. Yah, this exam is coming and I haven't studied anything! Anyway, before school ended, Mr HairyEars went into the class, scolding us for vandalising the tables. He demanded us to clean the tables by hook or by crook. We tried to borrow Thinner from DT room but to no avail. Instead, we moved the terribly vandalised tables with some at the Tamil Room! Woah, so daring! We moved the tables right under Mr YoonusFatball's nose! After that, Farhan and I, Sai Kang Warriors, the looked for items that is to be used for this upcoming Choral Fest. We went home, changed and went to Mac'd at Northpoint to meet Mr Sim to discuss about this upcoming event. We went to some florist to buy some Cosage for the VIPs. After going back home, I posted this crap......

      Today, I feel sooo sleepy! I woke up at about 5.30am to iron my uniform and went to the Interchange to meet the other NCC guys. We are supposed to go to NCC HQ And there we will take a bus to go to Mandai Hill Camp. All this fuss for the NDP mass display performance. There, we learnt Wushu from the intructors. I really don't want to go to this thing, really.... Anyway, it was fun doing the cool moves. Imangine myself wearing baggy pants doing wushu on National Day... I'll be a laughing stock! After that, Syarif, Farhan, Khairul and I went to eat at Northpoint. Yazid didn't follow us as he needed to change and go to tuition. There, we saw Mandy, Jun Hao and Uncle Michael walking around. Today, I posted this crap a little bit earlier as I am learning a few new songs on my guitar and after that, visit my gramps. By the way, thank you SalizZz for your concern about my hair..... :)

      Today, everything was so boring... One whole day looking at mdm Tai! Woah, can die of humiliation! After school, Mr Brian, Lydia, Mao Shen, Yazid, Farhan and I went to have a look at Victoria Concert Hall for the Choral Fest 2004. We looked around to make preparations for this coming Friday. Farhan and I were assigned as Sai Kang Warriors(shit work). Nah, I don't mind as we were logistics for GEMS CAmp and SEC 1 Camp. After looking around, I found out that I missed my favourite cartoon, ZOIDS! For the sake of these pathetic looking guys, I stayed behind... After looking around for some time, we went home. Yazid and I then went to Mac'ds. I found out that we can pay using our ez-link cards. Man, I am sooooo slow! We went home and I posted this crap to pass the time....

      Woah, today is very boring! As we are going to sit for our Mother Tongue 'O'level papers on 31 May, we have intensive MT lessons. FIVE periods of boring MT lessons! Then, looking at the teacher makes me want to sleep. We are participating in NDP mass display performance for the NCC, but I want to back out as....... we are doing wushu! My gosh, of all things, why wushu? Yazid, Syarif, Khairul, Farhan and I don't want to go to this crap! Man, it's a pity, we cannot back out! Doing this will make me lose face siaz..... To make matters worse, the training starts this SATURDAY! What am I going to do? I'm in a state of dilemma! AARGH......

      Today was soooo boring! No studies, no nothing whatsoever.... That morning became more dull when it was Mother Tongue. Seeing the teacher talk and talk makes me feel like sleeping. After recess, as we had nothing to do, Syarif suggested that we play ?Ali Pomp? The game is like hide and seek but more funny.... We played until the end of the day. After that we went home. At home, there was nothing do, so I posted this crap. This is the end, I wanna sleep!

      Today is the last day of examinations, yahooo!!! After the paper, SSEOs were supposed to have an important meeting but I went home instead to sleep. After that I followed Yazid and his band of merry band go jamming. That day was unlucky as I forgot the lyrics, Yazid's giutar was having some problems and Khairul sang badly. After that, we went to eat at the coffeeshop near the jamming studio. The food there was nice, I love it! I feel so tired now, so I am ending this!

      Hmm....today went well as normal. Today's CME paper was full of nonsense... marriage, morals, blah blah blah...Mrs Vannan gave out the POA paper a Miss Siva came late. She stood beside me and.....pheeyew! She stinks!!!! After doing our last paper for the day... Raj and Co. built a masterpiece made up of chairs. It was so hilarious! People from the next class then took pictures of it and looking at it with amazement. Back home, my mum didn't scold me instead she allowed me to play the laptop. Happily, I played and posted this crap. So, that's it! I wanna sleep! PS: Khairul, I will return the CD in a few weeks time...

      Yahoo,the major papers of my examinations are all over!!!! Before posting this, my internet cocked up, I feel so fished-up! It all went to normal after calling Singnet Technical Support. To the operator who served me today, I thank you very very much! Without you, I'll be so frustrated...Thanzzo! Back to this, today went as per normal. Nothing cool except when Mr Doraemon said that we should sing very loudly during the national anthem. Then, we did our NE quiz. It was soooooo boring! Answer a few questions and build buildings...duh so sucky! Anyway, we gat a certificate and the played hide & seek with my friends. It was sooo funny! Syarif, Amin, Zaman and I ran away from Amirul and hid outside the library. All of us hid by the cabinets and I was so stupid by hiding where that moron can see me.. At last, Amirul found us and we went home laughing..... Eventhough we are Sec 4s, we are sooo childish! That's all for today! I want to sleep! By the way.....THANK YOU MISS OPERATOR LADY!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Hmm...it's been a long time since I updated this...Woah, today is so tiring for us! Today, Yazid and Syarif didn't attent NDP training. Yazid went to Malaysia and Syarif kinda backed off... So, it's left with us; Farhan, Khairul and me. The training today was really tiring.  We needed to repeat the routine again and again until the instructors were satisfied. Anyway, I made friends with other school and that makes me feel satisfied. We were damn disappointed as there was no bayonet fighting... Nah, who cares! I don't feel like performing on the actual day. Aiyoh, somemore we got training every Saturday. I am sooo sick of this!

This is also the final year for me in this school...I'm going to miss all&nbsp; my friends, teachers and the school itself....I won't forget all the things I did at school....getting in trouble, doing mischevious things...I got about 4 more months until the day comes....eventhough, its a long time to go....I still feel very scared about this....study, study, study.......so, I'm going off now...

      What the heck is happening now? Problems seem to crop up everytime I go to school...this is going to drive me nuts! I dunno how to solve all these problem, but I'm lucky to have friends who are willing to listen to me...I really haven't been this stressed out until now..I need to stay back after school everyday, then at home also need to study..got some friends who are traitors, lame-o's and wanker shit...I know two guys whom I frigginly hate..one likes to crack lame jokes and the other sings like a toad & a trendy wanker...but both of them have the same qualities; they are big fat flirts and arrogant bastardz... Anyway, Speech Day is round the corner and we still haven't rehearsed until now...but I'm sure there is one tomorrow...but one thing that really made me damn f@rked-out is that I got 3 lines for my testimonial while one zombie; Victor, got about 5 lines! After all I have did and this is what I get? That zombie slept through the whole Annual Camp, does nothing and skipped training got more than me! Stupid bastard! Ah, studies is more important than testimonials...what good will I get if I got a 6 sentenced testimonial while my studies suck?  This is today's story and I am going off now.... BTW: I'm very sorry to.....someone down here..

      Hmm...today was supposedly to be fine until we found out that we needed to stay back to study until 4.30...WTF?!? Haiz, what to do...a few more months of torture and we're free...let's hope that my 'O'Level results are damn satisfying to me....Haiz, watched Spiderman 2 yesterday and forgot to pay Hazlin for buying the tickets...Hehe..the movie was all right for me and worth the money...After watching the movie, we went to the Esplanade and went up to the roof and hung out there, taking pictures...going there with someone special would be a nice place to relax...Aah, drop the subject!  Anyway, Y@tie, dun be sad anymore...I know you're damn angry with that old hag but you still got 2 more years, looking at her stupid face...so CHEER UP!  Btw, you want to tell me sumthing SalizZz?

      Well, everyone keeps telling me to update my blog rite? So, here it is!  Everyone knows that my class is the worst in the level. No matter what the teacher does, we won't give a damn...I doubt that we will change...Haiz, the 'O'Levels are coming and we are still fooling around...I want to study but I can't..I dunno why but I can't study at home or at school...At school, I will always be daydreaming or looking at her...At home, I will always go online, watch TV or stone around... Even if I study, it will only be a few minutes...I wanna change but I can't... Teachers nag and scold, but it seems ineffective to me and my frens...when I am given homework, I will do some of it and leave the others blank...and I totally give up at POA...no matter how hard the teacher teaches, it will always be a waste of time as not many of us pay attention to her.. My parents always says that I am smart but lazy, but I am really being plain lazy...Even after i falied in my tests or exams, they will still be by my side encouranging me to do better. My mum asked me recently if I wanted to go to tuition but I didn't want to go for it...I really regret it...  Now, after school, my class needs to stay back until 4.30 to study, study and study... I know the teachers care for us, but this is going overboard....10 hours of study! and at home more studies! So, this song lyric goes out for my loved ones, my frens and everyone who knows me....  Return To Self-Loathing    By: Mest -----------------------------------  Sick of the way I am feeling. Waking up watching myself slipping. Should i just take out my eyes? No longer want them for this life.  Acting strong only on the outside.  Hiding shame and pain on the inside.  I've tried to block my mind of this and pretend is doesn't exist.  Loosing my mind once again.  Stranding my thoughts (no matter what I said).   Sleepless nights staring at the ceiling.  Sanity running on empty.  Try to block my mind of this and pretend it doesn't exist.  Loosing my mind once again.  Stranding my thoughts (no matter what I said).  Taken for granted again.  Stranding my thoughts no matter what I said.  Loosing my mind again. Stranded my thoughts no matter what I said.  Loosing my mind once again.  Stranding my thoughts no matter what I said.     Please......I'm not pathetic or just acting cute....
