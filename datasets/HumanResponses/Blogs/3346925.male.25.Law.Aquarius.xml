      On finishing my constitutional law final, the only thing on my mind is how I'm one step closer to freedom. No, that's a lie. The one thing on my mind is nothing. After 4 hours of writing, what else can there be? Taking the final is a lot like having your mind pulled through the anus of a tapeworm: your mind comes out stretched, and both you and the tapeworm are worse off for it. I hope he can at least understand my essays. His exam was brilliant though. A metric assload of goodness: all the questions were clear and concise, and he even tied two of them together - pitting republican against democrat in the brutal partial birth abortion arena. Would Christians v. Lions be an appropriate title? Or perhaps Christians v. Loins? At this point, I dont even remember any of the cases. 2 days till Civil Procedure and I'm outa here!

      So I'm currently obsessed with Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Namely with Carl. Straight up one of the funniest cartoons around. Although I guess not many people my age watch cartoons, so no one's probably interested.  But its awesome. Serious.   There's these guys - the Mooninites - a bunch of a**holes (do I need to edit my blog?) from the moon who come down to corrupt Meatwad (a childlike lump of meat) into doing all sorts evil things. Like stealing DVDs.  The Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past arrives in February to tell Carl that his house is haunted by alien elves whom the Santa-ape (he was an ape. Now he is a machine!) had enslaved...thousands of years ago. Everytime he opens his mouth, the ghost proceeds on a lengthy story essentially rewriting history. He ends his speeches: "and that is where babies come from... for machines"  Carl's father got him carpeting (Burbur - thats an industry term) for Christmas back in 1963. "You can't eat carpet. Silly daddy." "No, of course you cant like that. You gotta boil it. 'Till the glue gets soft, you know."  Man its great! Check it out: http://www.adultswim.com/shows/athf/index.html

      Granting biotech rights in cultural knowledge instead of putting the knowledge into public domain will disincentivize technology. On the other hand, it will help 3rd world countries to become a part of the world market.  There is a good moral argument for this: freely taking a country's biodiversity because you have destroyed your own is kinda repugnant. But maybe there is also a good economics argument: this will incentivize the coutries with knowledge to discover it so it can be recognized as cultural products, and thereby enter the puclic stream of commerce. This is already happening in  urlLink India  (but in that case it is to prevent abuses of bioprospecting) Additionally, licensing can go to help with the cost of finding and preserving this type of IP.  The counterargument that countries will just sit on the knowledge is to me slightly lame: every piece of IP is a monopoly over the idea, therefore any patent that we are trying to enforce overseas is susceptible to this same argument, thereby making the point a good one only considering all IP, and not just the possibility of cultural knowledge. Because of this, I'm starting to think that possibly our current IP scheme is not too much or too little, rather, its in the wrong places.
