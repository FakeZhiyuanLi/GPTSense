						    The Whale Rider  by Witi Ihimaera:   This is a novel about a Maori girl, who is a descendent of Kahutia Te Rangi, the legendary "whale rider." She is the one who has broken the lineage (being a girl) and her grandfather doesn't quite realize that this girl has all the talents and the abilities to be their next leader (once again, because she's a girl). Kahu is his only great-grandchild--and Maori tradition has no use for a girl. But when hundreds of whales beach themselves and threaten the future of the Maori tribe, it is Kahu who saves the tribe. She thus proves that she is a whale rider, regardless of her sex. It is a heartwrenching coming of age story, that teaches us about family, the importance of traditions, and that sometimes we have to let go of those same traditions.    El Reino del Dragón de Oro  by Isabel Allende:   This book is a sequel to Allende's  Ciudad de las Bestias  (City of the Beasts). We meet Kate and Alexander Cold again, as well as Nadia Santos. The sixteen-year-old Alexander and his friend Nadia accompany his grandmother Kate, a reporter for International Geographic, on an expedition into the Himalayas. Soon, Alex and Nadia get caught in the middle of quite an adventure, which includes a monk, a crown prince, the kidnapping (and murder) of the actual King, and (basically) saving a nation. This is a young adult book, but I recommend it to all. It's fun and I can't wait until she brings out the third part of this trilogy.     Candy  by Mian Mian:   This book was great. It was a real sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll type of novel. This novel is about a young Girl, Hong, who is originally from Shanghai. She drops out of high school and moves away from her parents, only to get caught up in a life of drugs, clubs, music....surrounded by prostitution, crime....It paints quite a picture of China in the late 80's and 90's. Hong's relationships with men (especially her love, Saining) and drugs makes for an interesting story. It is a combination of old west/gold rush stories and of inner-city travails. Her language and sense of self are beautiful and she uses great imagery! I highly recommend this book!

						    A Good Man is Hard to Find and other stories  by Flannery O'Connor This book was a collection of O'Connor's short stories, including "A good Man is Hard to Find," "Good Country People," and "The Life You Save May Be Your Own." The stories are all set in the post WWII South. The stories deal with religion, spirituality, redemption, and racial relations.  I love O'Connor, because she uses very simple, common language and great imagery. Also, it doesn't help that she uses really grotesque imagery in her stories. There have been many that question whether or not Flannery O'Connor was a racist, since she does use the N-word and represents African-Americans in a certain way. I, honestly do not believe that she is. People have to understand that she is writing in conext of Georgia in the 1950's. To me, it was actually a very accurate way of portraying the place and time that she was living in. It is a great representation of reality! It's difficult for me to give a good review, since there are so many stories in this book. Instead, I will put a link to a sight where you can get lots of info. on her:  urlLink The Flannery O'Connor Collection

						      Under the Tuscan Sun   :  I started off really enjoying this book. It was as if I was right there with them fixing up the house and I was almost relieved when they (Frances Mayes and her significant other) could finally enjoy their new home and all the responsibilities that came along with it. Mostly the book kept getting me hungry (she constantly talked about food) and became a little dull near the end of the book, which was unexpected since I had enjoyed it so much in the beginning. I would still recommend this book, though, especially if you love cooking (I do), gardening, and fixing things up

						    Sushi For Beginners  by Marian Keyes:     Lisa Edwards, a London-based magazine editor, gets "promoted" by the company she works for to launch a new glossy magazine in Dublin. Ashling Kennedy gets hired to become Lisa's assistant editor and is ecstatic about her new job (unlike Lisa who feels like she's been demoted).The novel is about these two women and how working on  Colleen  changes their lives (for the better!).  I laughed a lot and I'd say that this book is a wonderful beach read!!!!    Go Tell It On The Mountain  by James Baldwin:     I fell in love with a book in 9th grade. The language was rich, the images vivid. That was when James Bladwin walked me down "Beale Street." I decided to read  Go Tell It On The Mountain , since it is the book that he is most well-known for.   The novel is a description of John Grimes' birthday (intermixed with a lot of flashbacks that give us insight into his parents' and his aunt's past). It deals with a coming-of-age boy, his struggle with his father, and a religious crisis. Some scriptural knowledge is necessary to understand the novel's deeper meaning. Even though the book moved me and it was highly imagistic, it lacked the realness and the beautiful language that I had come to expect from Baldwin.     I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings  by Maya Angelou     This is the first collection of Angelou's memoirs. She recounts the tales of her childhood in the deep south (Stamps, Arkansas) and later in San Francisco. It's about family, child abuse, growing up black (and female), and life in general. It is filled with life lessons that are applicable to all of us. The language Angelou uses is beautiful and her honesty, dignity in telling her own story, and her incredible sense of self make this a must-read!!!

						    On Death and Dying   by Elzabeth Kübler-Ross:  This book was very informative and interesting. It takes us through the 5 stages (or 5 responses, if stages seem to concrete to you) that people seem to experience when they are dying. The book has a lot of interviews with patients and their family members, and we also get the perspective of those who are taking care of these "dying" people, such as physicians, nurses, the chaplain, etc. Even though this book is three decades old it is still very applicable.     The Last Precinct   by Patricia Cornwell:  My sister got me hooked on Patricia Cornwell novels and the main character, Kay Scarpetta. Once again, this author did not let me down. Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner, gets caught up in a real pickle and has to fight to clear her own name (after she is almost murdered by Jean Baptiste Chandonne, Le Loup Garou). While all of this is going on, two tortured corpses are found by the police. The murders bear all the hallmarks of the work of serial killer Jean Baptiste Chandonne. There's just one problem: Chandonne is in prison. It looks like Scarpetta has a copycat killer on her hands. If you like writers like James Patterson, you'll LOVE Patricia Cornwell.     Gather Together in my Name   by Maya Angelou:  This is the second volume of Angelou's memoirs, and thus the follow-up to  I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.  This volume was just as wonderful as the first one.&nbsp;We enter young adulthood with Maya Angelou, who is now a single mother. She has a myriad of jobs, from being a madam to actually turning tricks herself. It is amazing and beautiful, at the same time, to see her honesty in exposing herself and her life to the whole world. She is, undoubtedly, a very proud, strong, and brave woman!
