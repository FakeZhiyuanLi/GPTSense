       I am in Des Moines right now. I have been here at my sister's apartment for about a week now. I have been having a lot of fun. One major downfall though is that I have had sunburn on my shoulders. I couldn't move very much without feeling pain. The burning went away and now it's all pealing. My skin is dry so when my shirt gets moved around it hurts for a bit. Sleeping is a pain. I guess I am somewhat out of order.  I miss some stuff about home. I love to play games and I am a big fan of the  urlLink Warp Pipe Project.  I left my Gamecube and Broadband Adapter at my house. If I come back this summer I will be bringing that along with Mario Kart: Double Dash!! because my sister has cable and I will be able to get a good game going. We don't have cable available in our area yet. MediaCom has it available in the city but we have our house in the country so we have to resort to low-grade DSL. It does the job, I guess.  I am going home later today. In a way it sucks but really, it isn't that bad. I was on a trip in Washington DC for a week. Then I came back home for three days and then came down here for a week. I haven't seen much of home.  Well, I don't have much more to say! I just want to emphasize how cool  urlLink Warp Pipe  is and how everyone should look at  urlLink Warp Pipe  instead of nasty XLink. The  urlLink Warp Pipe Revolution  is near and you should check out  urlLink the Warp Pipe Forums  to find a download of Test Builds of the Megaton, also known as  urlLink Warp Pipe v0.4.

       This is my first entry in the Undies Drawer. I should start out by telling you a little bit about myself.   I am a 14 year old male who enjoys computers, football, games, and lots of music as well as movies. I like hanging out with my friends and family. I play guitar and am working on learning C++. I am interested in persueing a career in the field of software engineering.

       I'm back in Des Moines at my sister's apartment. They have cable internet so I was able to play a nice game of Mario Kart with Chad, the project manager of  urlLink Warp Pipe Technologies , the best frickin' thing on this planet, at around 1/2 speed. It was the fastest game I've played.  We went to an animal adoption thing and adopted a dog. It was stray so we got to name it. I suggested Meat or Bone but everyone else said that Maddy was better.  My brother in law designed a tattoo for me. I can't get it put on but it looks cool. It's a Japanese character, but we don't exactly know what it means. I thought that a tattoo with "GONZO III" on it and then some Japanese writing under or after it would be cool.

       Well, this morning I woke up at around 7:30 to head home. It had been a great night. My sisters and I went out around town and drove up to fast-food places. We'd park up by the person who give you your food and we'd blast Micheal Jackson's "Beat It". I don't like MJ, personally. He's quite creapy. That was pretty fun.  We got back to the apartment at around 12:30 and watched "50 First Dates" and fell asleep. I was on the floor of course. No complaints though.  We got back at around 11:15, just in time for me to shower and get ready for my dentist apointment. I had no cavities, which proves that it was a waste to come all of the way back home for a measly dentist appointment.  I am running out of things to keep me entertained. I should go upstairs and check whats going on.  Peace out.

       It's been a while since I've updated. I guess I'll do it now.  Well, last night I started working on the graphics for my site. I have the table made but the problem is that I have a large banner at the top so the table is offset. I have to cut the image up so I can make everything fit nicely. I'm going to start doing that really soon.  I forgot how much fun web design can be.  I haven't had any websites since those that I made when I was younger. There was one for 4x4 Evolution, an offroading game that I used to play, and one for video games in general that my friend and I tried to set up. They all have failed. This one probably will too.  One thing that I'm doing differently, though, is I'm setting everything up, getting some content, and then I may buy a domain and a hosting plan from Dreamhost.  I have chosen Dreamhost because Chad Paulson, the Project Manager of the  urlLink Warp Pipe Project  had possitive feedback. There is also a affiliate program where you can earn $65 for each referral you get. If this is actually true, I figured it was an opportunity to get a domain and a good hosting plan, while at the same time, support the Warp Pipe Project, and all their great efforts.  Well, I'll let you know if I ever buy a domain.
