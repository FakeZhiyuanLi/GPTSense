      Yes...It is official. Karma does infact exist, although not in the assumed connotation of "Oh No!Run its Santa"(heh). No no. More in the sense of effect inevitably catching up with cause and rears its (in my case)ugly head in one way or another. Serious wake up call tonight/this morning. Still shaken from the experience which was very surreal. So much so that my brain is having a hard time manipulating my fingers to type this...Or was it the handcuffs?...Whatever the reason, I am shaken. Aside from that, all I really feel is stupid and disappointed. This merely affirms my complete lack of good judgment. I don't think the part of my brain that controls anything in the least bit involved with common sense is existent and/or functional. Although the "myopia lobe" seems to be in working order. I can't believe all I was thinking of was if was a vampire that knew kung fu with the ability to shoot lasers out of my eyes .Effing fuck...I'm horny.  p.s. I apologise to all of the zero people who read this blog for its appalling spelling/grammar/tense agreement.

      Ugh. Some weird conspiracy involving other towns plotting my demise...Some deadly anti-Santa Rosa ninja crime syndicate is trying to hunt down every Santa Rosa resident and destroy them. Yesterday it was Sebastopol and now it seems the ninja syndicate rules Napa with an iron fist as well. 90% of every place of business was closed by 1:30, including the "comics stripped" show, which we( urlLink Shawn , Silvanie and I) drove all the fucking way to Napa to see, all the while being incinerated by the merciless sun...Bah... Swift death to Napa/Sebastopol and all who reside in those wretched towns.

      Curse you wretched legs! Damn you!...Work free from the chains of apathy/laziness that bind you to this chair and fucking walk your skinny asses to the deli and buy food so you wont die.   smek...I could eat a baby right now. A really fucking fat one.   I hate bodies...they require so much maintenance. Alwayz halving too feed them and let them sleep just to repeat the cycle. blah.stupid hunger psychosis induced babble. But besides the crippling hunger, my day, up until this point has been quite relaxing. The intense relaxation has put me in an odd mood unfamiliar to me...itz pleasant... I feel very much as i imagine a monk feels... captured by everything and really everything in. Besides showering, i have pretty much been reading all of my conscious day...infac,t why am i wasting it writing in this stupid thing...

      Was verbally skullfucked in the eyesocket by bosses today...woot...WOW...i hate condescending, hippy, dillusional, pseudo artists that have no clue about what they are talking about. Everyday, the extent of my boss' cluelessness continually shocks and amazes me.  Being talked to by them is like having an enormous, highly pressurized horizontal stream of acidic shit shot into my face, filling every orifice of my face with steaming feces. At least hot girlz haz been talking to me as of late. Yay for interesting, hot asian girls!

       urlLink     An older drawing that I finally posted. Some vague symbolism going on. He has five arms.   Ugh...&nbsp;Bodies aren't meant to ingest&nbsp;unholy amounts of &nbsp;food. And repercussions of doing so&nbsp;really fucking suck. Experienced the full extent at its most wrathful today. Bleck. Chinese buffets are simoltaneously the worst and best thing on earth. Comparable&nbsp;to how&nbsp;having a&nbsp;four hour long heart attack would feel.&nbsp;Feels like an air pocket in my chest or something. Except the air is in the shape of a knife that is sticking in my heart and the air is really fire.   "Ah!" For&nbsp; intensely weird, wonderfulness. THAT was strange... I'm fighting a holy war in the men's room.

       urlLink     Noize: Littlecat  yeah...just a bad ssshot of a doodle&nbsp;I did on the phone.&nbsp;Frog, which turned into a beet, which turned into a leech, which turned into whatever the fuck it is now. The really awesome paper kind of calls for a grotesquely morbid drawing, but meh...   Heh. Was told I am distant and emotionally cold yesterday.   The Velvet Teen/ Littlecat show sufficiently owned. Felt weird watching Littlecat live. Really wanted to cut the arms off of some girl who decided to interpretive dance in the middle of the lobby. You could see everybody mentally murdering her. But all was rectified when she got served by&nbsp;Guy and a really, really cool flamboyantly gay elf. Littlecat + pixie/robot dance = dope... The Velvet Teen&nbsp;are really effing good live, but turn into timid little schoolgirls when attempting to talk to the crowd between songs.   Lost the last dwindling shred of respect for Shane yesterday for his massive shame spirals at the merch table at nearly every show he attends and for his all around shadiness. Ha! If you are reading this, Shane, you are a loser!   &nbsp;

       urlLink     Drawing of a baby that is anatomically incorrect in every way.&nbsp;   I love how every meeting between two or more of my family members inevitably ends in a huge fucking argument about my recent run in with the law. Although the intensity and volume of tonight's &nbsp;easily surpassed all previous&nbsp;disagreements to become one of the the biggest emotional Holocausts ever witnessed&nbsp;in our&nbsp;&nbsp;household.&nbsp;Ended in quite the heated little talk with one of my sisters&nbsp;and I. More specifically, with her and I screaming in each other's faces from six inches away at the top of our lungs. Simultaneously screaming over one another with liberal usage of the "f word". Not stopping or breathing. Veins bulging.&nbsp;Just fucking screaming as loud as humanly possible. I don't think she listened to anything i said,&nbsp; because&nbsp;even if i wanted to at that point, it wasn't&nbsp;impossible to hear anything. I was just focusing completely on what I was saying, in vain, because obviously nobody could hear what the fuck was being said. To the spectators, it was just sonic screetching that instantly melted anyone's eardrums within ear shot. So Jerry Springer...   Ugh...It was bound to happen because of the copious amounts of alcohol, and the previous hour and a half's worth of in depth shit talking. Did sombody leave an oven on? Despite my better judgment, I walked into the gaschamber aka the kitchen where all of it was going on, to fix a bagel. And as consistent as the sun setting , I was dragged into it.&nbsp;No time was wasted for everyone to thoroughly drill me at the same time when all I wanted to do was eat my fucking bagel!&nbsp;Right on cue, Silvanie&nbsp;started personally attacking me instead of constructively "giving me a good talkin' to". To which&nbsp;I defended myself, which fueled the already out of control fire storm, inferno of hell.   Despite my sister, and her infatuation with starting and holding on to conflicts over stupid shit,&nbsp;I don't want to&nbsp;have a damper on our relationship.&nbsp;I know my&nbsp;family loves me,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I love&nbsp;them and can't verbally express my deep appreciation for their help, emotional and financial, but I can't help but feel Silvanie was just venting on me. Simply using this as an excuse to project left over feelings of spite for some other drama going on in her life. I really was listening and registering what they all had to say until Screamfest 2K4.&nbsp;   RWAAAWR!!!!!!!!   ....death.....   On an unrelated note, Velvet Teen and Littlecat tomorrow will rock my fucking ass. Will have to hold back urges to&nbsp;choke all the scenies to death with their white belts...Jesus Christ this post is long...um...end.   &nbsp;

       urlLink     Well, Monday went about as well as a day can go after waking up to multiple guns a foot from your face, which is to say, not very fucking well. Being inTERRORgated just kind of ruins your day. The stupid fucks left their evidence case at my house too. Have been kind of paranoid as to if there is a bug in it recording ever incriminating thing we say  ...Drawing of an ameoba on really cool paper Silvanie gave to me. The pic doesn't do the paper justice. In person, it hurts your eyes to look at.

      My hands are scaring me. Some would agree that I have  almost  been drawing too much lately, if that's even possible...Which it isn't.  Something made me ponder the absurdity of the act of drawing. I find it really odd that making lines on paper&nbsp;to make a cohesive image that resembles something is considered to be one of the highest forms of self expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really stupid when&nbsp;you think about it, but then again, anything is if you think about it enough.  &nbsp; Friday night was good. &nbsp;   urlLink CIS  fieldtrip with  urlLink Shawn ,  urlLink Eric  and Pete.&nbsp;Felt really out of place and awkward the whole time.&nbsp;I get really quiet around the big kids. "Beautiful Losers" exhibit at the Yerba Buena was good and fucking huge. Japan town in all of it's novelty gloriousness only furthered my yearning to go to Japan. Staring at poisonous animals in glass cases was fun, as always. I don't like where this post is going and my eyes hurt like a&nbsp;mufuggin biotch, so...&nbsp;&nbsp;

Was talking to bitter, smoker, half Japanese, con artist Micole today. Since neither of us had any money, she decided to steal everything necessary for a picnic. After the full extent of her masta thief skills were swiftly exercised, we had a ghetto picnic at jamba juice with her friend. HA. Must make that a routine for the duration of work...Being two days...Damn.   HA! Wiesled out of working on mural. Air tight. Micole's all pro con artist ways must be rubbing off on me.

      Noize:"Intergalactic Planetary" Beastie Boys  Dipping back into my compulsive drawing mood which probably has something to do with my recent insomnia. Its all I've really been doing. Really, ALL I've been doing. I think it has just been my mood lately, which has been very detatched and just weird. It has started a nice little self perpetuating cycle: my disconnection feeds my incessant drawing and visa versa. Drawing pictures of grossly deformed, copulating sharks into the wee hours of the night does something to you. I wouldn't mind being like this all the time. Kind of like a constant version of that feeling you get when you nap for a really long time and you wake up thinking you are late for school/work and franticly get ready and go only to realize you are 12 hours early...Well, not exactly like that, but kind of...Actually not really.   tomorrow, i.e Judgment Day, should be fun...Let the execution begin.

      Noise:Q and Not U- X Polination/Book of Flags EP  Remembered the reason for getting this stupid blog...pictures. Will post drawings soon.   Saw Fahrenheit 9/11 with a friend who's compentency behind the wheel I am beginning to have serious doubts over. All should see it. Had a hard time concentrating on last third of it because my stomach felt like it had flaming knives in it, so after went to In'n Out and talked crazy mad shit about my arch nemesis, Sky (yay). Seemed a little overly persuasive seeing as how if you were watching it you were most likely not a crazy BUSH4LIFE right wing conservative, but nonetheless a very good movie. Reminded me of how much I don't like dead babies minus half a head. I can honestly say Bush is indeed the black angel of death.  !  BRAWR! WORK=DEATH! MY BOSSES AND EVERYONE EMPLOYED BY THEM SHOULD ALL BE SHOT, MINUS ROBIN. ESPECIALLY MARY, MY TWIT ASS BOSS, WHO SHOULD BE BEHEADED FOR BUYING VINYL BASED PUTTY INSTEAD OF PLASTER BASED PUTTY AND MAKING MY BENCH LOOK LIKE ASS AND FOR TELLING ME TO FINISH MY PAINTING IN ONE DAY WHEN IT HAS TAKEN THREE DAYS OF NEARLY CONSTANT WORK TO DO HALF. MMM RUN ON SENTENCES...IF SHE FUCKING TELLS ME TO TURN DOWN MY MUSIC ONE MORE TIME IM GOING TO SLIT HER THROAT. CAN'T WAIT TO GET PAYCHECK. CAN'T WAIT TO NEVER SEE BOSSES AGAIN. CAN'T WAIT TO SABOTAGE THE SHOWCASE. CAN'T WAIT TO NOT HEAR HOT STONERS TALK ANYMORE. CANT WAIT TO NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH DAVID TRYING TO TALK TO ME ABOUT MUSIC. THE ONE THING ABOUT WORK THAT I WILL MISS IS EATING THAI FOOD NEARLY EVERYDAY. THIS IS ALL IN CAPITOLS BECAUSE NORMAL LOWER CASE LETTERS CANT FULLY EXPRESS MY RAGE.

      Well...Yesterday was fun...Came home to my hysterical mom in a fit of rage regarding an article in yesterdays paper about me and Eric. An earth shaking argument ensued for the next few hours.  ...  "  Graffiti Taggers should know that police are taking special measures to catch them, and that those measures do pay off.     At hard-hit Santa Rosa Junior College the other night, police cadet Mike Peters was hiding, watching and listening when he heard someone shaking a can of spray paint. He radioed for officers, who caught two kids-both 17-year-old Santa Rosa High students-in the act of tagging a building.     One of the kids is believed responsible for the ubiquitous "MSG" tag that has cost property owners tens of thousands of dollars.     We'e hope firm punishment leads him and his buddy to explore better ways to make their mark."  ...  Kind of flattered by the paper calling us "ubiquitous", but at the same time its really frightening. Eventhough the article is small, it still made it to the papers. The full degree of how potentially fucked I am really hit me when I read it. Wasn't really aware it was that big of  thing. The figure seems a little steep and I also hate how it makes the po-lice come off as though they have been working towards catching the infamous group of hoolums behind the prolific tag "MSG" and there was finally a case break that lead to our arrest. It was merely chance that we were in the JC when they were and we just happened to be two of the people that write particular letters in a particular order that they happen to be looking for. It was just dumb fucking luck. We were really dumb to go to the JC... Ah. And the rumor about the existence of a branch of the SRPD Anti Graffiti Unit being specifically assigned to catch MSG is officially true. Fuck.

      Noise:"Oh Comely" by Neutral Milk Hotel...Best song I have heard in a while.  Blaaaaaaaaaaaah... The lame has been thoroughly broughten. The events of last night are beginning to fuck with me, which wasn't helped by mind numbing boredom. I have been so bored all night I am stooping so low as to turn to posting as a form of entertainment. I forgot books and can't think of anything to draw...smek. I need me some funning. "Funning" and "broughten", the literal manifestation of how bored I am. Ugh...I suck. This blog thing has gone too far.   I spent the last 45 minutes sitting in nearly complete darkness watching unknowing dinner party goers pee while listening to a barely audible Looney Toons theme song loop endlessly. Its funny how much noisier people are in the bathroom when they don't think people are in earshot. Yeah. I'm creepy. Chortle.  My codemnation to this wretched place is due to my mother's recent doubt in my ability to be out in the late hours of the night and NOT get arrested. At dinner, I was forced to leave the table when conflicting views of pepper, and to what foods it is appropriate to be applied to, clashed. I don't really blame my mom for reprimanding me. Although it is somewhat of a blow when your mother thinks you are a delinquent, which isn't entirely untrue...But thats not the point! The point is not being able to do anything ain't cool. I'm not sure how much longer i will be branded a crimin-imi-NAL that habitually breaks every law humanly possible. Actually I really should be relieved the expected tsunami of rage never came. Wow. I am not learning my lesson at all. Can you say "repeat offender". Hello federal pound me in the ass prison.

      Hmm...Very unexpected/odd event ended a somewhat weird day. Still have the aftertaste in mah mouf which, surprisingly, didn't leave me thinking "pizzza". Ha. It made me feel like John Madden on so many levels. Or maybe a moth... Not sure what that means, but anywayz... In retrospect, I'm not sure if it was a wise decision. Verbal walkthroughs should have been a warning sign. Although, in situations like these, personal experience has led me to vote yes on "striking while the iron is hott". Not doing so extremely dilutes, if not, kills the purpose. Overanalyzing and meticulously weighing the pros and cons of every action leaves little time for anything else because if one does miraculously calculate the answer, they will have certainly forgotten the equation. There will always be an element of risk because you can't be certain about anything involving something (apex of unnecessary vagueness)that in the end, will never be fully understood by anyone. If you wait too long, it WILL collapse in on itself and leave a mess nobody has the patience to clean up. Although I'm getting ahead of myself. I guess what I'm trying to say is that nothing should be left unsaid/done because, as long as you mean it, it deserves to be known because uncertainty is slow death and nobody likes that.       Race cars are fast.     Well, what have we learned...Don't read The Art of War, when really you should be fighting...Ew.no.something else...um. Thinking=Bad.

Later I annilated her with an oversized, inflatable bottle to the dismay of elder G and G shoppers. Payback's a muthafucka!   I am not a bitchwhore.   Well. I am the subject of a police investigation. Goodbye spotless record...But hey, at least I'm getting attention.

And now the goddamn taco bell clerk guy who, before giving me my shitty food, insisted on showing me and giving longwinded commentary on every motherfucking one of his tattoos and stab wounds he got in prison.  genuphobia - the fear of knees. pogonophobia - the fear of beards. phengophobia - the fear of daylight. keraunothnetophobia - the fear of falling satellites.

He called me something along the lines of "cattle" or "sheep" or some other herd oriented farm animal, for reading a news paper. He was really convinced that he was a vessel of god, who was "totally blowing some squars minds". He actually claimed to get his news directly from god.

Scanned a picture into photoshop, completely forgetting the fact that I haven't used it for about a year and a half, thinking that I could easily fuck with it...No dice...I am more than a little rusty. So much so that I completely forgot about layers, the most fundamental element of photoshop. I only realized this after I worked the clone stamp and fucked up and couldn't undo it because after I had smudged the shit out of it on the same layer as the drawing. Blah. So I just rescanned and posted it without any altering besides cropping it.   Square CDs are the coolest thing ever to have existed and they are even cooler when they are three minutes long. Although mummified baby rabbits come in a close second. It's sitting on my TV staring at me with its tiny dehydrated eyes.

After drawing it I noticed how he kind of looks like he's trying to hide the vomitous art that was on the desk before.  The highlight of my day was drinking a soda I found in the bushes.

       urlLink    Noise: "7 Days"- Azure Ray  Drawing I did when I was REALLY tired. Probably partially explains it's general what-the-fuckness... I hate the lightning bolt.  Heh...Got out of bed around 5ish (p.m.) yesterday.

       urlLink    I did this on the side of my desk with paint pens. Woot for an attempt at undertones.

       urlLink    Fuck Robin and his shitty photography skillz. This bench looks significantly less shitty in person. Yes, it is a bench and yes it was shitty painting it entirely in acrylic. Process in its entirety took about 5 weeks of semi focused working. Prep work was the majority of the work and was a mufuggin' BIOTCH! Notice the maticulous cut out job between the seat and the backboard and the lack of previously existing slats? Probably not...

      Noise:"Roll the dice man,baby needs a new ellipsis" Roots of Orchis  Ack! Realized yesterday how much I loathe children. There's something about being called "Junior" by a person who is at least two feet shorter than you that makes you want to shank that person in the neck. Doesn't really help when a little girl suffering from acute ADHD describes one of your drawings, the product of what you spend the majority of your free time doing, as coming from "the land of ugly". And it crosses the line when she tries to serve me by drawing a shitty picture of a heart. Wei unofficially adopted her under the name of "that fucking trashylittlebaby". She had a pot belly. But at least she was bluntly honest,which I prefer over humoring or passive aggressive shadiness... It all starts going down hill when puberty starts...  Speaking of teenagers, and come to think of it, people in general... I think it's funny when people state their vastly superior intelligence over small children. Especially when people try to deny/justify/rationalize the one prevailing thought of everyone. When it comes down to it, people are equally, if not more impulsive as kids under the age of 6. They still have those thoughts/urges, it's just they also have self control. Teenagers reflect well the general populace: they more or less have the intelligence of adults but their raging hormones inhibit their judgment just enough for them act on their impulses. Everybody knows what teenagers do when you leave them alone together in a room.

      Noise: "Running over the community service worker doesn't make you a hero"-Get Get Go  Ha. Mentioned a few minutes ago how lame it is to post the music you are listening to as you are posting. Hypocrisy...What would I do without you...  Cleaned room a few days ago like a competent person. Took about 7-8ish hours...Ugh. But hey, least it was been a trial in self restraint, a side of myself I haven't been showing much of lately. Not always a bad thing. Anyways, it's not entirely my fault.  Holy shit this ( urlLink http://http://gprime.net/images/sidewalkchalkguy/ ) is so rad! This ( urlLink http://www.kurtwenner.com/gallery.htm ) is his page.
