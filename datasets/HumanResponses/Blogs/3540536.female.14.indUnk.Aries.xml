      i'm supposed to be cleaning, but i'm on the phone with aaron and he's distracting me. he's talking about shaving his legs..i don't know what thats about not sure i want to.i think i made jourdan cry cuz i have a better relationship with molly than she does but it's not my fault that i have been there for molly through everything, and that i'm the one she puts most of her trust into, i can't control her feeligns nor do i want to because she is who she is and i love her all the same.i am just the one who is always there ALWAYS no matter what is happening i'm there.and i always will. she is the only one keeping me alive rihgt and to have to lose her in almost unbarable but i will be able to see her alot so it's all ok. it is all just..i am still always here.  till tomorrow..when it comes again..  .::>hannah

      have you ever had this person you could never get off your mind?they steal your heart over and over again everytime you look in their eyes and they smile. or how bout when they talk to you even when they say the stupidest things imaginable but it still fases you that you found this one person that can make you smile more than anyone can. i have a guy like that. he may say the most weirdest, annoying, funniest, things but it's ok..cuz i know what he feels for me..and the cubans..and i know that he cares..and i'm jsut glad he can see i'm not the person i USED to be but i am the person who CHANGED who she used to be. he sees me.  till tomorrow..when it comes again..  .::>hannah
