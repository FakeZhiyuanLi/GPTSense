      I don't know why I feel so out of place in my own skin, but I do.   I'm sorry for every one reading this because all you have to listen to are misplaced words and melodrama. I'm sorry. But it's true. I have all of these plans and nothing works out. I just want to get the hell out of this town and never look back, I'll be okay on my own if I can just get out there. But I can't.    I can't do anything right, and I'm sorry for that because whether or not you believe it it's true.    Sometimes, things happen in life. Things that aren't supposed to happen. Bad things. Or maybe its nothing at all, just a feeling, an emotion, something that shouldn't be there. This is one of those things.   Those things you don't talk about, you barely even think about. You can't bare the thought of sharing it with anyone, letting anyone close, letting anyone in. Because that thing has broken every thing. And you are nothing but hollow glass and delicate porcelain disguised as bone inside. If someone was to come in, if you let them in, you run the risk of shattering every thing.    So you don't. You keep them out, and you keep every thing inside wrapped up in cobwebs because its better than being totally broken.    You keep everything and everyone at arms length because they might be clumsy and you could come crashing down inside. I'd rather be shoddily glued behind bulletproof glass where nothing could touch me than risk being shattered again and again. Someday, they're not gonna be able to put me back together.
