      Nice quiet little place..... This morning, I am guiltless.  My bedroom looks like a teenagers room; or atleast like mine when I was a teenager...wading through clothes in various piles of disorganized organization...  I have just moved.  I'm having trouble really wanting to put away, make pretty.... Too much moving. But this morning, I don't care.  I am "off". numb I guess.  If you don't take some guilt free time "off", life is just too hard.  How can I ask my daughters to do what I don't feel like doing?  Their rooms are a teensy bit better than mine...  I worry - far too much. House payment, selling RV we need to sell, dying, living, spaying the dog, making money, not being depressed, finding work I like, producing useless art, writing useless books, ever being happy for any length of time, the girls being happy, what my friends think, how my husband is feeling, what I'm not doing to make the house nice, how much I'm spending on any given day, cars problems, dentists......... that's a few of them.  I want to sit, gaze at the desert, feel the air, just be.  There's too long a list..... too much I don't care anymore about getting done.

      The Duties I have taken upon myself: Make sure there is food in the fridge, and something for dinner for everyone. (I feel extremely guilty if I have not provided dining suggestions, prepared something... why is that? I guess because M works all day...children have lives to live...and I, well, I'm the mom. I am supposed to feed, nourish, comfort, and clean up after the day is done, just like all good animal moms.  Not that I'm perfect, or always clean up well, or always cook wonderfully.... still...the guilt if I don't...) That's most of it. Keep the house nice.  I'm not working, so...  The horrible thing is, I don't do a great job at this all the time, and the horrible thing is, I feel guilty, oh so horribly guilty, when the house is disastrously unorganized...  Can I determine to devote my time to my desires..to creating art, to organizing my writing? Is there a good enough purpose in that?  Will anything come of it?  Could I make a living? Unfortunately, I'm not terribly methodical, or disciplined.  I have to be inspired. Struck by the muse. Uninterupted.  Then, the duties I have taken upon myself arise... and whether they are done, or undone, the thought of them shadows me, and guilt floats up, and uncertainty.... What I should be doing, don't feel like doing screams "naaaanaaaa" at me. I feel extremely weak.

      I'm not sure at the moment how I will find a way out from, over, through, the depression that shadows me.   If I do something, become seen, maybe that will help.  "Something" being creating, artistically, in some way or another, and see myself alive in that work. Purposeful.  Writer:  When I go in the bookstore, and see the multitudes of books, I wonder, who wants another?  Has it all been done? I know it hasn't...... everyone has a unique voice.  Still, those 50%off stickers...ugh.  Artist:  Art is everywhere.  It seems so cheap anymore.  Redundant.  Done.  I suppose that's partly why abstract art is so appealing to me now, and the only thing I'm interested in creating.  Does being unstable, over-sensitive, afraid, come with the artistic ability I have? Does it have to go together?  I think I may make lots of entries today.  On all different things.  A cleanse of sorts.
