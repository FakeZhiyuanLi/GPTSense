      MOVIES  I don't know whether to blame tony scott or christian wagner for the movie that is "man on fire."  how much say did wagner have in post?  the movie would have been great at 100 minutes, but it rolls to a stop at 146.  was it drama, or action?  i don't think scott wanted to pick, and it shows.  two biggest miscues: Radha Mitchell  picking up a southern accent half way through, and the cutesy subtitles.  inovation sometimes fails, as it did here with the dancing, haphazard use of subtitles.  not being a big fan of scott, i still have to say he messed up a good story.  maybe that is his true gift.  at least "spy game" was shown out of order when i saw it: that made up for the shabby post-production work.  what was the reason this time?  Man on Fire:  B-

      BUSH THE IMPERIALIST  a commenter chastised me for speaking ill of the president due to his efforts to grow the country with at the least economic imperialism, and at most territorial imperialism.  i say that if we're going to go that route, why are we picking countries so poorly?  iraq has oil and we got to depose of a madman, but saudi arabia is right next door, why not them?  americans love italian and chinese food, can they be next on the list?  and canada has been asking for it, the way they don't protect the border and offer us drugs and other health care related treats.  they want it.  let's get going before that other imperialist, france takes all the choice countries.

      THE MAVERICK MINUTE  bill simmons is mostly right on the subject of the  urlLink mavs .  seeing nelson go is a must.  all offense all the time is fun to watch, but painful to route for.  i think it's time to let finley go, and hopefully get more young and tenacious talent.  they need a stopper in the biggest way.  rasheed could help at this point.  they need someone that can step up and take charge in the post on both ends of the floor, and they need to move bradley.  maybe he could work for cuban getting things down out of the top shelf and free lance saving kittens from trees, as this basketball thing seems to be alluding him.  all in all, they need to pick big three pieces (nash, dirk, and jamison) keep their role players (najera, fortson, howard, and daniels), and start fresh.  trim the offense fat and build something that resembles a nba team

      GIANTS AND PRODUCTIVE OUTS  seeing the giants at the bottom of the productive outs list was not surprising, as i'd expect them to be near the bottom of most team batting categories other than IBB.  looking at the walks leaders, the top four walking teams are all in the bottom 6 in POP.  looking at batting average, though, all the 6 top POP teams lead the bottom 6 POP teams, allowing for a higher OBP as a group.  this is misleading, as these groups will both regress towards the mean, making the teams that walk more the true threats to score more runs.  also, of the bottom POP teams, the red sox and yankees, can expect significant improvement later on.  boston will improve with the return of nomar and nixon, and the yankees will improve when their shortstops start hitting.  in the top 6 of POP, who can reasonably expect texas to keep their .316 average?  they are playing well above their heads as a whole.  all in all, i'd say that POP is a POS stat.

      COMMON SENSE AND THE "PRODUCTIVE" OUT  people smarter than i have argued against this "stat" and people i'd assume at least as smart as me have argued for it.  this argument comes down to this: there is only one instance when an out would even be on par with the production of a hit: less than to out, man on third, sacrifice fly/hit.  there is no other instance when any right thinking individual would prefer an out to a hit.  how can an out be productive when it is an inferior outcome?

       urlLink cut to the chase , amoung others has an article describing the defacing of holy relics in iraq by us troops.   urlLink from political commentary by marc rios:    United States forces fighting in the holy Shiite city of Najaf have damaged the shrine of Ali. This is extremely significant: imagine being a Catholic and finding that some nation had damaged St. Peter's Basilica. The damage is only four bullet holes, but the symbolism is very very serious.  wow.  there is no respect for the religion of iraq being shown is there?

      i think the lake show ends this round.  wolves in 6.  also, the pistons strap up and get their "d" on.  pistons in 6.  pistons are flying high off of destroying the nets, and they match up well with the pacers.  i see rip going off.  the lakers are old.  they won game 5 on a miracle, and i can shoot as well as the spurs did in game 6.  they were not dominant,  and  the other team slipped.  the wolves are riding good vibes and two hot hot players (kg and sammy).  the only thing that can stop them is for shaq to go off for the whole series, or for kobe to play like a man possessed.  i just think the wolves can weather that storm and come out standing.

      my friend erik is a bush backer, but this  urlLink story  even got him  urlLink upset .  the school's actions were bad enough,  urlLink but look at some conservative commentary on the subject .  here is the poem:   REVOLUTION X  Bush said no child would be left behind And yet kids from inner-city schools Work on Central Avenue Jingling cans that read Please sir, may I have some more? They hand out diplomas like toilet paper And lower school standards Because Underpaid, unrespected teachers Are afraid of losing their jobs Funded by the standardized tests That shows our competency When I'm in detox. This is the Land of the Free ... Where the statute of limitations for rape is only five damn years! And immigrants can't run for President. Where Muslims are hunted because Some suicidal men decided they didn't like Our arrogant bid for modern imperialism. This is the Land of the Free ... You drive by a car whose Bumper screams God bless America! Well, you can scratch out the B And make it Godless Because God left this country a long time ago. The founding fathers made this nation On a dream and now Freedom of Speech Lets Nazis burn crosses, but Calls police to Gay pride parades. We somehow Can afford war with Iraq But we can't afford to pay the teachers Who educate the young who hold the guns Against the "Axis of Evil" Land of the Free ... This is the land If you're politically assertive They call you a traitor and Damn you to ostracism. Say good-bye to Johnny Walker Lindh And his family. Bye Bye. American Pie. So maybe My ideas about this nation Don't resolve around perfection But at least I know Education is more important Than money. Land of the Free . . . If this was utopia We'd have to see each other naked Before we got married But instead, we see each other naked all the time Because the government has my social security number And the name of my dog! And then we make babies, But don't worry, they won't be left behind And they grow up saying God bless America! But they don't know who Bush is Because they never learned the Presidents. And they will ride the ship Amistad To our dreamland shores Bearing the same shackles as us. I'm here to say that Generation X Is pissed and we are taking over, Ripping down the American illusion of perfection We are the future generation I have my qualifications I know it looks like Angel Soft paper, But don't worry It's a diploma Do I look qualified? You can take our toilet paper, But you can't take our Revolution.   thanks to the  urlLink progressive review

      the debate over ClearPlay dvd players that edit movies of questionable content  urlLink continues .  this is bad.  there is a simple way to stop children from seeing content parents don't want them to:  don't make it available.  if you don't want them watching something you don't like, don't let in the house.  if you can't control your kids, don't expect a dvd player to do the job for you.  also, the assault on copyrights and trademarks is appalling.  why have freedom of expression if you can't use it?

      my biggest problem with the current administration is the lack of uniformity on the issue of the value of a life.  a strait life is more than a gay life (at their quality of life), an israeli life is worth more than a palestinian life, and an american life is worth much much more than an iraqi, or really, arab life.  i'll concede that bush's concern with american lives should be very pressing, as he is the president, but then he places his agenda before american lives.  so my question is, what is a life worth?

      on a trek through some blogs, i happened upon a 14 year old that was against gay marriage.  we debated a bit and came this compromise:  she didn't like it because she is a homophobic religious nut, and i could see the validity of getting rid of marriage all together.  i went back to her blog to see where she stood today, and her comment section had been removed.  so i win.  in the same vein, i was at a catholic blog that had people debating the same issue with me until i dumbfounded them and they started accusing gay people for all the disease in the world.  so i guess in the battle of open discussion, it's charles 2, religious homophobes 0.

      1.  can you point out where this bias is please?  yes, some outlets skew left.  others skew right.  where are examples of true bias that aren't refuted in other mainstream media.  i'll look at them all.  i want to be proven wrong.  it seems to me that we buy it because we here it so much.   urlLink here is a study  that shows that in many ways the "liberal" media is in fact conservative.  just watch the cycles.  who ever is on top gets the lion's share of the negative press.  why?  it sells.  2.  as for the off-topic comment on cnn and fox news, have you tried to watch cnn?  the production values are low, and their people don't shout and put people down as much as fox news.  america likes to be entertained, and that is what fox news does.  here's a question:  what is more popular, a documentary on, say, anything, or reality programming?  what is more popular on-line:  intellectual debates like this one, or porn?  just because it's popular doesn't mean it's better.  3.  i'll give you that fox news is a better watch:  they do a better job, period.  if cnn could match production values, then maybe they'd be even in ratings.  i'm an msnbc man myself.  4.  as for the new york times, they know the prison scandal will sell their papers, so thats what they put on the cover.  if kerry was found out as gay, or a junkie, or to be cheating on his wife, what do you think the story one page one would be?

      one thing i want to clear up:  i don't really like the democrats.  i just like them a lot more than this current batch of republicans.  i think the two main parties are inherently flawed in their practices and they both concede too much to their financial backers.  i know i come off as a demo because they tout support for many things i believe in, and i'm outspoken about my dislike for republicans.  that doesn't mean they really speak for me.  i'm the worst kind of independent:  i sound a lot like one of the main parties, but do not align myself with any third party.  i am merely a liberal.

      i just watched every family guy episode (i have a lot of time on my hands right now) and i have to say they have some real hate for the forgettable "dharma and greg."  i never saw a whole episode, but it never seemed any worse than any other show.  why the hate?

       urlLink i am all for getting rid of dirty bombs in an attempt to keep them away from terrorists .  the last thing we need are unstable people with "the bomb."  i am also for greatly reducing our weapon stockpiles.  i think we can rest assured with  less but better weapons.  do we really need  urlLink 10,000 nuclear warheads ?  how about we destroy some of the weapons we don't need?

      i just learned chris farley was the original voice of shrek.  too bad they didn't finish his dialogue so this could be his last movie.  yes i know, dirty work was his real last movie, but he is forever saddled with the memory of the very forgettable "almost heroes" being his swan song.  just why didn't that movie work?  a talented director: christopher guest, a great physical comedian: chris farley, a good strait man: matthew perry (as evidenced in "the whole nine yards"), and a great character actor: eugene levy.  yet it is pure crap.

      the pistons are ready to host a block party tonight, or at least i hope so.  while low scoring games are usually a nightmare to watch, game 2 was a delight.  there is nothing better than a game when one team dominates the other at one end of the floor.  i hope the pistons can hold them to 60 tonight.

Put me in charge and we'll bring back the Russian gulag.  There's plenty of wide open area in Alaska just begging for some death row inmates to come and break up the millions of rocks into tiny bits of gravel.  I don't know about you, but a life of hard labor doesn't sound too appealing.

      i have to say that i disagree on the aclu's position on this  urlLink case .  after looking at it, i think it is much less a religious issue and very much a historical one.  the seal represents the history of the area, and for that reason should be kept.  on a similar note, things like swastikas and the "stars and bars" are symbols not just of history, but of hate.  was the church a good influence in california?  that can be debated, but the are key to the history.  i think the biggest problem i had with erik was his unjustified slam at the aclu.  like them or not, they serve a purpose.

      wow.  he has 37 IBB.  the next closest: the arizona diamond backs with 23.  that's right, the whole team.  bonds has 10 strikeouts and 68 walks.  he is on pace for over 200 walks and 44 hr.  has he juiced up?  if there could only be one thing responsible, then i'd say yes.  but with new training techniques, better bats, and personal trainers, all atheletes have been getting bigger.  with bonds, the big deal is: 1. his trainer being in trouble, and 2. his being so much better than everyone.  so i say that other reasons are just as viable, and until it's proven, i'll assume he's not guilty.

      well, these two teams split their to regular season games, both home teams winning.  the lakers even gave up 106 at detroit.  this was all before rasheed came to detroit.  so how will the series play out?  most people are guessing 4 or 5 for the lakers.  but let's look at this thing.  the lakers only work when shaq is killing and kobe gets going.  the wallaces' can hang with shaq, making his life difficult.  prince is out of his mind right now on d, so put him on kobe.  hope the rest don't kill you, but it's not like everyone else in detroit are slackers on the d end of the floor.  who can stop rip?  they say kobe, but can he keep up with rip and still be effective on the other side of the floor?  the boggest problem on offense is big ben.  he won't do anything against shaq.  so who will win?  i'm taking detroit in 6.  i think they'll slow down and beat up la, and in the end rip will be the only one left with anything in the tank.  at least i hope it happens that way.

      sure the lakers pulled out the win, but don't act like the pistons are in trouble now.  they came back in that game to take the lead near the end, then didn't foul shaq.  they came that close to being up 2-0.  they still took the home court away, so watch out.  the pistons are playing great team ball, don't be shocked when they take two of three at detroit and win in six.

      he compared ww2 to our current problems in iraq in an attack on michael moore.  this really bugs me.  do we really see everything in terms of ww2, whether it is an apt analogy or not?  do we blame the history channel?  is it the only war idiots like quinn understand?  and finally, shouldn't the host of a comedy show be at least a little funny?

      a day of honoring reagan was both appropriate and very touching, and it all was non-partisan for the most part.  that is until i watched the o'reily factor.  he had the gaul to compare the current prez. bush to reagan.  the "great communicator" to the guy who doesn't mind getting "misunderestimated."  the man who helped set up the ussr for its fall, taking out our last great enemy, to the man that tried to make us all fear for our lives from an evil dictator in iraq.  these men may have had the same basic goals, but it is unfair to reagan to compare him to bush.  give the gipper a little respect.

      well, i'm back.  i'll know if i have a job in two weeks, as they need to let the school year end first.  the real fun is the trip, so here were the highlights:  the trip going there was uneventful.  once in nyc, i caught a taxi to hotel 17, which is on 225 east 17th street.  only i was dropped off at 25 east 17th street.  at midnight.  after 5 hours on a plane.    to explain hotel 17, let me tell you a story:  my freshman year of high school, my grandfather took me to sweden to see where our family had come from.  we stayed one night in a 19th century prison that was converted into a hotel.  those rooms were bigger than hotel 17.  when i was leaving, i had made it to la guardia three and a half hours early.  good thing.  i arrived to find that american airlines computers were down.  the consequences of which were three-fold, all information for people without tickets or itineraries was lost, the baggage checking system was shut down, and the system they use to identify people to give a terrorist-level search to was inoperable.  this caused a line a fourth of a mile to wrap around the inside of la guardia.  and i'm not exaggerating.  after about 70 minutes a woman came up and asked if i was checking any thing.  i said no and produced an itinerary, so i was able to skip to the line waiting to be searched.  60 minutes later, i was searched, and on my way to the first of 3 gates my plane was supposed to land at.  but i had it better than a group of elderly people that were headed to florida:  they had to change gates to one in a different section of the airport.  this meant another security check.  luckily, they had someone escort them past the security check.  i hope they weren't terrorists.  so now i'm on the plane, and on time!  but a 90 minute delay takes my optimism and spits on it.  i only had a 70 minute lay over in chicago.  we landed in chicago with three minutes until i had to be at my plane.  i look up and see that the plane to el paso is on time.  the gate i had to get to was about an eighth of a mile from where i had landed, so i book it over there.  and the plane is delayed.  and delayed, and delayed again.  so i call up a friend in chicago to say hi.  about a minute into the call, my flight gets moved up to one of the earlier delay times, and i land in el paso twenty minutes later than i had planned on.  that was my (latest)trip to the city that never sleeps.

      after a day of cleaning up after a toilet overflow and then debating over at  urlLink rants of the conservative mind , i check the scores and see that gem of a score.  it is enough to make me feel good about the whole day, toilet and all.  the giants have moved into second place, and bonds might break his own intention walk record by next tuesday.  if they are playing to potential (with durham "healthy" for the first time this year, lets hope) then they have a real chance.  the only thing bugging me?  rooting for the yankees this weekend.

      quickly on the nba:  the pistons will sow this up in 5 if they keep up the energy on the defensive end.  the only concern they should have is a monster game from kobe, but i don't think that that would be enough to take down detroit.  on to the giants: when they picked up ponson last year i was optimistic.  he was passable in the season, but was pounded by the fish.  well, he leaves to go back to baltimore and then the giants come to town.  what does sindney do?   urlLink he calls out barry bonds .  if only every pitcher was this stupid.  of course bonds goes deep on him.  they are now a game and a half back with the blue jays coming to town.  i just hope they win this series (or even sweep) before the red sox with wakefield and pedro come to town this weekend.

      let's start with the worst part:  the audience.  i hate audiences that feel a need to interact with the move.  well, this audience was worse than a trekkie at the latest star trek film.  it was almost insufferable.  they cheered when moore's name came up, booed bush the first time he was on screen, and yelled "yeah" so many times i wondered if a group could catch tourette's from those around them.  the booed when the film cut out a few seconds before the credits, then gave a standing ovation to the screen when it finished.  i hate these types of people.  as for the movie, the grade first: A-  ok, moore's unfair attacks:    1. the eggs thrown at bush when he was elected. -sure, it was shady and likely should have gone the other way, but don't give time to nuts that throw eggs.  2. that bush was on vacation 40% of the time in his first eight months. -he was away from washington, so it looked like he was on vacation.  i'll give bush the benefit of the doubt and assume he did some work in his 96 days away from the white house.  3. that it was bush personally that allowed the bin laden family to fly. -this issue is all over the news today, so go find out the latest.  it does seem odd, however, that the fbi would let them go  4. bush as deserter. -i think we've all agreed that deserter is a step too far.  5. bush's oil company going under. -have you been to west texas?  it was rather dry to begin with and has been pumped beyond all reason.  i'm not shocked a company would fail.  6. asking if bush was wondering what would be best for the saudis, instead of america. -this was mostly baseless and totally unfair.  7. the look at the war. -while he did a great job showing what was really happening in iraq, he did not mention how bad saddam was.  this was being unfair by omission.  8. giving the lady outside the white house on screen time. -not really unfair.  i just don't like her.  ****** highlights:  1. highlighting the disenfranchisement that occurred in the 2000 election. -this story was buried under chad-mania.  2. the choice not to show the planes hitting  3. the video of bush as he heard about the planes hitting. -i looked more concerned.  4. examining the interference run by the white house at dissuade commissions from looking at 9/11.  5. the bonanza scene  6. look at the terror alerts.  7. small town america being warned to fear terrorists.  8. the patriot act and the wacky stories about it - peacefresno was funny  9. oregan state police  10.  powell and rice stating in 2001 that saddam didn't have wmds.  11. rumsfeld calling the coalition of the willing the mother of all coalitions  12. looking again at "mission accomplished"  13. the list that the recruiters were keeping of people who did not want to sign up. -what was up with that?  that said, i think this movie is important, and you should see it.  just keep an open yet skeptical mind.

      a pet peeve of mine is when movies are lambasted for paling in comparison to books they are based on.  i think we should judge each as separate entities due to the extreme differences in the art forms.  this isn't to say that i on average enjoy translations when i am familiar with the material.  for instance, primal fear becomes unwatchable if you've read the book.  if you haven't it's a fine movie.  that's all i'm trying to say.

      is he a prick for the sake of being a prick?  he was talking to the founder of 'black cops against police brutality' (a policeman himself) last night, and instead of talking about the problem of police brutality, he touched on it and then attacked the guy.  here are the talking points, with answers in bold:   why black cops and not cops against police brutality?    i created the group and i wanted to call it that.    would you help people that aren't black?    yes.  we helped a white guy that got shot a hundred times recently, and help people of all colors.    look at this video  (of a cop hitting a guy on the legs with a flashlight).   is that police brutality?    yes.  if you strike with the flashlight it is automatically police brutality, as we are trained not to use it as a weapon.  (pat:  i can't tell if it's a flashlight )   so why don't you go after the real problem of black-on-black crime?   because my group is committed to stopping police brutality.    so you don't think that black-on-black crime is important?    i didn't say that.  of course it is.  my group speaks to another problem.    so black-on-black crime isn't as important as police brutality?    i didn't say that.  they are both important problems.  my group focuses on police brutality.    well i don't see why you ignore black-on-black crime.  gotta go.   while not verbatim, this was a good representation of the event.

The world, for the most part, is known.  there are no more continents to discover, no lost cities of gold.  space, though, represents a practically untapped arena to reach out and discover.  will the world care about taking a larger step into space without pressing reasons forcing them to?  i do not know.  i hope we realize that exploration is its own reward.  and yet every time we have ventured into the great unknown we have found riches beyond what we could have hoped for.

      the grade: A+  -sploilers ahead-  first:  another bad audience.  two kids kept yelling and making a general rukus, a bay cried most of the time, and some morons applauded the credits.  this movie was great, much deeper than the standard summer fair.  alfred molina proves he is one amazing actor yet again, and cameos by bruce campbell and hal sparks add humor to an already funny, yet dramatic plot.  even the cheesy "united we stand" scene was much better than the first movie.  was it perfect?  no.  but it sure was close.  this movie shows just how good a comic book movie can be.  the title credits were particularly nice, with the first movie shown in graphic novel slides.  my main problem?  heavy-handed foreshadowing for a sequel.  go watch this movie.

      they open up their series tonight at the dodgers.  these teams have split the series so far this season, both going 5-5.   urlLink a look at their head-to-head stats  shows that perhaps the dodgers should be in first, but they are in third at 3.5 back behind the padres and giants.  an interesting stat is the giants' lead in walks at 341.  bonds has 109 of them.

       urlLink we are getting to the point where the wealthy are feeling the pinch of being too computer literate .  kidding aside, this raises the question, do we need to know how to manually write?  cursive writing today could easily be limited to learning how to write your own name and read all the letters, and nothing would really change.  as far as manuscript writing, this is the only way we really need to hammer home when writing, as there will always be the need to jot things down.  let's ditch script writing is all i'm saying.

      they take the series from the a's, bonds goes deep, and he scores his 2,000 run.  they also hold a 3 game lead over the padres, 3.5 over the dodgers going into their trip to chavez ravine.

      well, i got a letter telling me the fate of the interview i had in the big apple.  it turns out i do not meet the credit qualifications to switch to math from history.  the problem:  i called them three times because i knew texas credits didn't correspond directly with cuny scores.  three times i was told that i had no problems, that they checked it out and i could interview.  even at the interview i asked again, making sure i wasn't wasting everyone's time (and my money).  well, the letter explained that i was not eligible, due to the credits not corresponding.  now, at any point they could have cleared this up, but they didn't.  and i'm out $500.   urlLink at least i got a story out of it .

       urlLink why does texas attract cults ?  i guess it's the land you can buy for cheap and the fact we're not a desert wasteland. well, my part is, but most of it isn't.  this story makes me wonder, though, about where the line between cult and religion is.  this story is about a cult, i doubt any would argue that.  but if they get enough people, or stick long enough, will they get recognized?

       urlLink so now using hitler is ok .  well, that's what bush's campaign is saying.  in an attack add on their website, bush's campaign uses clips of people bashing him, as well as a piece of a clip from moveon.org that featured hitler.  now, moveon.org pulled the add because they felt it was in bad taste.  i hope bush's campaign will do the same.

      this is another one of my favorite directors.  i love all three films.  here is my ranking:  bottle rocket.  A+   i love this movie.  this just might be my favorite film of all time, and most of it has to do with dignan.  this is sublime "dumb" comedy that is much smarter than most films.  i tend to judge people on how they feel about this movie.  rushmore.  A  this film works the whole time and looks about as good as a movie can look.  there is nothing i don't like about this movie.  the royal tenenbaums.  A  this film looks great and is very well done, but seems too unique at times.  regardless, i do love this film.  an aside:  my best friend's mother hated this film so much she stopped it about thirty minutes in and refused to finish it.  while these are listed in chronological order, they are also in order of my preference.

      not that i'm on the fence about bush, but  urlLink bringing up a marriage amendment  again rubs me the wrong way for two reasons: the obvious homophobic nature of the bill, and using amendments willy-nilly.  but won't this hurt him with people that are on the fence?  i know many republicans that are not excited about the prospects of changing the constitution, so why mention it now?  i am not seeing any political upside to this move.

      i've been kicked out of the  urlLink outlaw republican  blog for basically being a big bastard.  guilty?  anyone that knows me knows the answer to that. (yes)  my only gripe:  how little orange fox (head blogger, then only blogger) kept bashing people she didn't agree with in petty and irrational ways, then was shocked when those that disagreed with her sounded off on her.  i can't count the number of times she'd post something only to take it down when it was shown to be a weak or flat-out baseless attack.  where was the accountability?  oh well.  as long as the fox is happy, it's in the past as far as i go.

      the grade: C  this movie doesn't come close to working overall, but it does have it's moments.  i have never been a will ferrell fan, but i have appreciated him in certain roles.  this role could have worked in a different movie, or this one if the focus had been on the rivalry with other networks instead of inner-office turmoil.  the movie worked best when supporting actors were on screen.  steve carell is by far the best of the main cast, and jack black has the funniest role in the film.  too bad he had less the four minutes screen time.  the other network anchors (vince vaughn, luke wilson, ben stiller, and tim robbins) all work better than ferrell, and even the dog comes off funnier.  my favorite part was in the outtakes when they threw in an outtake from smokey and the bandit 2, or the afternoon delight moment.  this film would be good for the dollar theatres, or maybe a rental.  a disappointment.

      the grade: B-  this film was long on action and very short on plot.  in this case it works.  the movie bastardizes the traditional tale, but tries to bring to life the origins of the traditional story.  the film is carried by the performances and a nifty scene taking place on a frozen lake.  keira knightley only helps the cause, as does her outfit later in the movie.  some questions:  what the heck are woads, and what was up with stonehenge?  if it looked interesting then catch it, but if the trailers didn't get you excited, then nothing else in the film with either.

      knowing that everyone is always on the lookout for a great movie, here are some of my favorites (in no particular order) that have not garnered much attention:  the minus man  B+  owen wilson stars as a a serial killer who fancies himself an angel of mercy.  brian cox (i love that guy!) co-stars.  it has a dreamy feel to it and is hauntingly low key.  vulgar  B  a sick, sick movie from view askew (kevin smith's production company) this dark film tells the story of the clown from the opening of clerks.  not for everyone, but interesting.  zero effect  B  bill pullman stars as a sherlock holmes-type trying to solve cases without interacting directly with the outside world.  ben stiller plays his representative, a watson-type.  run ronnie run  B  this movie is based on a running sketch from "mr. show."  it follows the life of a man that makes a living out of being arrested on reality cop shows.  scotland, p.a.  A-  it's macbeth set in a 70's fast food joint.  the sound track is almost all bad company, and it works fabulously.

      Many thanks to the  urlLink liberal slayer  for sending me  urlLink this story on the subject .   If two adults want to wed, let them. If they find a cleric to grace their nuptials, hallelujah -- although signing a contract should suffice. Clergy and laity should decide who may and may not marry in America's religious institutions.   i have to say that that about mirrors my views on the subject.  another point touched on in the article that has bothered me is the notion that marriage is about having babies.   As for child-rearing, same-sex-marriage opponents should explain why couples who fail or refuse to reproduce or adopt may enjoy matrimonial benefits. If "the core purpose of marriage is to bind children to their mothers and fathers," as Stanley Kurtz argued July 1 on National Review Online, marriage licenses should expire after, say, five years if husbands and wives neither bear nor adopt children.   a fair point.  you should read the whole article.  let's look at this subject rationally and figure out what is right for america before we butcher the constitution.

       urlLink this story  bothers me on two levels:  first, isn't this the kind of action that shows that "the terrorists have won?" and in the extreme this seems like an attempt to justify holding power in the face of losing an election.  think about it:  bush is set up to lose the election, then word comes of a possible attack and the vote is postponed indefinitely.

      these guys rock.  they are masters at weaving stories that a quirky yet magical.  who wouldn't want to live in the worlds they create?  here is my ranking of their films:  the big lebowski.  A+  i love this movie.  while it gets downright weird at times, this film has moments of pure genius, and at no point does it disappoint.  while some people think there is much too much cursing in this film, it doesn't bother me.  fargo.  A+  this is my favorite movie that centers around a murder plot.  from the characters to the settings this film paints a funny and poignant picture of desperation and hope.  a great, great film.  o brother, where art thou?  A+  one of the best literary translations you're likely to see, this film is fun and timeless.  it also makes light of texas politics, and that is always fun.  miller's crossing.  A  the hardest of the films, this is a great gangster film with solid performances by everyone.  a gangster film that gets slighted when naming great gangster films.  barton fink.  A-  i just love the leads.  goodman is always great with the coen brothers.  the man who wasn't there.  A  a great film noir turn for the brothers.  i have a soft spot for black and white films as well.  this film sticks out for being stylistically separated from other coen films.  the ladykillers.  B+  while this wasn't there best work, tom hanks is great and i love j.k. simmons.  this movie was fun, but isn't as good as most of their work.  raising arizona.  A-  i know a lot of people would put this higher.  this movie is great, but doesn't work for me as well as some others.  it was still a great film that really put these guys on the map with most people.  intolerable cruelty.  A-  i like this film.  it was light and fun, but it felt a little like the brother's were mailing it in.  it was good, but you get a feeling it could have been better.  still better than 90% of the movie out there.  hudsucker proxy.  B  definitely not for everyone.  this film was stylized within an inch of its life.  many characters came off as a bit cartoony.  despite all this, i like it.  you know, for kids.  blood simple.  B  the only thing that hurts this film is the volume of great films that came after.  a great suspense film that is all the more noteworthy considering this was their first film.

       grade: A-       this movie was very good at being a spy thriller, which is good because that is what it is. while the twists were obvious, they still delivered. so did the chase scene, at the end of which i realized i was holding my breath. my only complaint is the seemingly total lack of steady-cam. while i appreciate the hand-held feel, it was done to excess. that alone nearly took it down to a B+, but in the end i had too much fun to go that way. as long as you're not prone to motion sickness, you should catch this film.

       my extended family is in town this weekend, and to help them feel better, i attended church.  we looked at 2 kings 13.  my favorite verses of the bible are in 2 kings, so i'll share those with you here:     KI2 2:23  And he (elisha)  went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.    KI2 2:24  And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.     if i don't update regularly this week it will be because i'm at in-service for the new school year.  peace.

      grade: B+  i have to admit to be a fan of both the leads in this film, as well as a fan of many of the cameo-stars. this movie is a buddies-on-the-road formula film that works because it knows how far to take the joke and when to play serious for the laugh. neil patrick harris' part was particularly nice. if you are looking for a good clean fun stoner film, harold and kumar is for you. i recommend it.

      the grade: B   this is a movie based on the summary of a dust sleeve of the book.&nbsp; if that.&nbsp; but as its own movie it is entertaining, and it takes some nice steps in dealing with the three laws of robotics.&nbsp; this movie should have had another name, as it is judged (fairly) by the book.&nbsp; just don't name a movie after a book if it isn't going to be anything like it, or take the family guy avenue (peter griffin presents the king and i).&nbsp; as a stand-alone flick it left me with good vibes and no regrets.&nbsp; a solid summer choice that you should give a chance if you like will smith movies (though this one is the slightest bit smarter than most of his big-budget work).

      after polling my classrooms (8th and 10th) i have found that they, too are split on who should be the next president. they are also evenly split on gay marriage, which does surprise me. it is amazing to see how much some of these students know about the issues. my biggest goal is to get them thinking about the issues without besieging them with my views. hopefully i'll get them to care about politics more than my generation does.
