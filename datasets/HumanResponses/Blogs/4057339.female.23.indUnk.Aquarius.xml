      So I got a callback for an interview at this bed & bath type store I gave my resume to yesterday.&nbsp; The interview is tomorrow morning.&nbsp; I'm sort of nervous that&nbsp;I might get the job.&nbsp; Does that sound stupid?&nbsp; Well the thing is that I don't know if I want to work there or not.&nbsp; It's more retail.&nbsp; It looks like I'll have to dress up.&nbsp; It might be one of those commission&nbsp;places where they expect employees to be pushy and&nbsp;follow customers around like a bad fart.&nbsp; In fact, it probably is.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; Well, I guess I can ask questions.&nbsp; I mean, of course I can.&nbsp; And I'll tell them I don't do the aggressive selling type stuff.&nbsp; If they wanted me to&nbsp;do merchandising or cash or stock&nbsp;and the pay is alright then that'd be OK.&nbsp; But also, I'm just worried I'll take the job and then a place that seems better will call back.&nbsp; ARGH.&nbsp; I wish there was more deciding time.&nbsp; I mean, I suppose I can be a flake and take the job and then just fuck off and go to the better one if they call, but it seems morally wrong .. and well, mostly I just don't know how to go about saying "so yeah I thought I wanted to work here, but then this other place called that I like better so yeah, um, bye".&nbsp; Oh well.  I'm also taking my G1 test tomorrow.&nbsp; I've never taken it before.&nbsp; I'm nervous.&nbsp; I hope I'll be ready for it.&nbsp; I'm gonna feel like a knob if I fail it.&nbsp; Everyone keeps going on&nbsp;about how easy it is, but I know a significant number of people who've failed it the first time.&nbsp; All I need to do is pass and then I get to finally get behind the wheel and see what it's like.&nbsp; I've never driven before.&nbsp; Not even an inch.&nbsp; I want to get my licence so that I'll be able to drive by next summer.&nbsp; I felt so helpless in B.C. without a car.&nbsp; I wonder if I'll be a good driver.&nbsp; I'm paranoid and overcautious, so probably.&nbsp; But who knows?  I'm going to study some more.

      I really hate that Blogspot ad at the top of this thing.&nbsp; Is it just in all&nbsp;the templates they provide, or do all blogs have to have this unless you're a paying member or something?&nbsp; I've looked throught the html and everywhere in the settings and help section and I've found no information whatsoever on that damn ugly ad.&nbsp; I've seen blogs without the ad, so I know it's possible not to have it there.&nbsp; Oh well, I guess once I tell my guy about this thing I'll see if he wants to make me a template (because this one is boring)&nbsp;and maybe he can fix the ad thing, too.&nbsp; If the ad can't be removed, I will be forced to abandon Blogspot, because that's gross.  Also, I have the HaloScan comment thingy now, but I can't figure out how to change it so that the time and the number of comments aren't RIGHT THE FUCK NEXT TO EACH OTHER as if they were the same link.&nbsp; I hate that.&nbsp; But the html is not the kind I'm used to fiddling with so I don't wanna take any chances.&nbsp; And the trackback thing .. that confuses me a bit.&nbsp; I'm not sure exactly how it works, but I think I'll keep it there because I guess if someone should ever link to one of my posts, I'll want to know about it, and that's what the trackback thingy does, right?&nbsp; I feel like such a knob.&nbsp; I was so used to Diaryland.&nbsp; But I can't stay there forever, I needed some kind of change.&nbsp; Things were getting too stagnant and weird there for me.&nbsp; Does that make sense?  I feel weird.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think I need to go eat something with nutritional value.

      So I did the resume thing.&nbsp; I didn't hand out a whole lot, maybe four or five, but they all had help wanted signs up.&nbsp; I did one restaurant and the rest were all retaily stores, so I'm not sure how I feel about that.&nbsp; I should've given my resume to all the coffee shops even thought they didn't have hiring signs up.&nbsp; I'm such a pussy.&nbsp; I'll do it tomorrow or maybe Friday because then my boy can drive me (no I won't have him come in the places with me when I give them my resume, I'm not stupid).  One of the stores I gave my resume to is a chocolate/candy/ice cream shop and I wonder if that would fuck up my weight loss.&nbsp; I think I'll be OK.&nbsp; I'm good at saying no to food on principle if there are people around me.&nbsp; It's when I'm home&nbsp;alone that there's trouble.&nbsp; So anyway, I dunno how I feel about working retail again, but I only gave my resume to stores I thought I could maybe probably tolerate working at.&nbsp; I guess if I get another retail job and then realize I hate it, I can still look for a coffee shop job and quit the retail.  There was this one restaurant that looked nice that was hiring but the sign was written crudely in marker and it said "SEVER WANTED" (they meant "server" of course, I hope anyway)&nbsp;... and it made me not want to work there so much, because that would be just like if I gave my resume to some place and it was written sloppily in marker or crayon and full of really bad spelling mistakes.&nbsp; And then I saw that they had another sign up on another part of the front window and it said the same thing in the same crude marker, "SEVER WANTED", so I was like, OK, no, I can't work for anyone that crass and stupid.&nbsp; So I didn't give them my resume.  There are some dog stores in the area that I'd love to work at too, but I also didn't give them my resume because they didn't have signs up and I am stupid.&nbsp; One sells dog food and treats and the other sells all kinds of other dog things like attractive&nbsp;food bowls, doggie clothes, doggie sunglasses (yes, they exist, and my boy and I once&nbsp;saw some people buy some for their bulldog and put them on him, and they looked so funny and cool, and he hated them and kept pawing them off and that was even more funny), stylish chew toys, etc.&nbsp; I think I definitely need to give them my resume, because I would love love LOVE to work at a store where people are constantly coming in with their dogs.&nbsp; I love dogs so very much.&nbsp; Everything about them makes me smile.&nbsp; I even like dogs who bark loudly for no apparent reason because I think it's funny, it's&nbsp;like if a person just suddenly flipped out and started going "HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! LOOK AT ME! I'M MAKING NOISE! HEY! HEY! HEY!" and it makes me laugh.&nbsp; Dogs are great.&nbsp; I've never had one because I've always lived with my parents and they never allowed it, but once my boy and I get our own place and it's one that allows dogs and we have the time and money, we will get one and I will love it.  On an unrelated note, I miss B.C. oh so much.

      So I have this other diary&nbsp;(I was going to link it, but then I started worrying that that would somehow cause readers of my other diary to find this one and I don't want that at all)&nbsp;that I've been using for a few years but it's really not doing anything for me anymore, and my entries bore the shit out of me, even, so I can only imagine how it must be for all those other people who are still reading me out of some sense of loyalty because I used to be so funny and saucy (well, I like to think I was, but maybe I'm just&nbsp;flattering myself) and they're still clinging for dear life.   So anyway, I decided to start this new thingy and not tell anyone about it until it actually gets going, because this way there's no pressure and no obligation to write and if it doesn't work out for me I can go back and try to salvage the&nbsp;other diary or just quit diary-writing altogether or do whatever the hell I feel like doing.&nbsp; I'm not even going to tell my boyfriend just yet, because the second I know someone is reading it, especially someone who knows me, everything will change, so I have to establish this thingy first.   I've never actually been to Blogspot before, until the other day when I visited the blog of this girl my boyfriend had sex with once on his prom night way before I knew him.&nbsp; I like her blog and I like how she writes, because it's different and not all stuffy and pretentious like the way a lot of bloggers write, or the way I started writing when my diary stopped being fun to read.&nbsp; Also, she puts naked pictures of herself in her blog, which is great because&nbsp;I loves nekkid girl pictures ... except it's kind of weird too because my boyfriend reads her blog and there are&nbsp;these naked pictures of her there and he had sex with her that one time and he's friends with her now and she's all sexy and skinny and saucier than I am.&nbsp; But it would be unfair of me to be all&nbsp;jealous about that because he and I hang out with a guy I've had sex with before I&nbsp;knew him&nbsp;too.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm also glad he's friends with her because she seems cool and I'm starting to really dislike most of&nbsp;his other&nbsp;friends.&nbsp; I feel bad for saying that, but it's true.&nbsp; They're not particularly&nbsp;smart, they're not really nice .. they're pretend-nice but then you hear all these things about them that are just awful and you just have to hate them a bit.&nbsp; It wouldn't be so bad if they weren't pretending to be such kind, well-adjusted people.&nbsp; And anyway, they're boring.&nbsp; I like most of them alright on some level, some more than others.&nbsp; But I won't get into that any more.&nbsp; God, what if they found this blog and realized who I was?&nbsp; I'll have to be careful who I tell about it.   So I'm supposed to go handing out resumes today (I'm looking for some sort of cafe waitress/barista type job, or maybe a retail job that looks tolerable -- I've had some really shitty retail jobs), and the weather forecast for today  yesterday  said the rain would stop by noon, but it looks like the rain has only just started, really, and now the forecast is saying risk of thunderstorms.&nbsp; This would be alright if I were passing out resumes in a mall or something, but I'll be outside on the streets, and the drowned rat look is kind of unprofessional.&nbsp; So I'm wondering what I should do.&nbsp; I already had a shower and shaved my legs and everything so I could wear my nice skirt and it will seem like a waste if I don't do it now.&nbsp; I shaved with Gillette Satin Care Wild Berry shave gel, and it smelled really familiar and I couldn't figure out why, and then&nbsp;I realized it smells&nbsp;just like Nerds taste.&nbsp; You know, the candy.&nbsp; Do they still make Nerds?&nbsp; I remember they used to come in those little half-and-half boxes with the two different flavours.&nbsp; I haven't seen them anywhere in ages.&nbsp; They were like tiny sugary crackballs, really.&nbsp; Anyway, the handing out resumes thing .. I guess I can just use an umbrella.&nbsp; I hope it's not too windy.&nbsp; All our umbrellas are cheap and&nbsp;do that flip-uppy thing in the wind.&nbsp; It's embarrassing.&nbsp; Also though .. umbrellas have a lot of metal.&nbsp; If there's lightning, could I get fried because my umbrella acted as a lightning conductor?&nbsp; Am I being paranoid?   Anyway, I guess I'd better go and make myself pretty so I can go out and do some job hunting and feel good about myself for actually getting something important done.

      So I've emailed my resume to a whole ton of people advertisting various jobs online. Most of them are desk jobs or data entry or whatever. The thing is, I  know  I can do these jobs, and yet I know they're not going to give my resume a second glance because all of my work experience is in retail and my education is all .. "to be continued" or something. Except I don't know how to get office experience without actually getting an office job first, and I can't seem to get one because I have no experience. It's a nasty catch 22.  Also, I recently learned that you have to mail your resume to something like a hundred companies in order to get maybe one or two replies, and then you have to be lucky enough to get an interview and actually get the job. So yeah. What the fuck is the point of any of this? Is it all just about who you know? Because I know nobody.  So I'll get another retail job and try and get through some college courses that will maybe get me some more credentials I guess ... it's just ... ugh. I don't know what I want to be and I don't know how to get there and it's making me crazy. I've become obsessed with figuring out how to make a lot of money because I can't stand the thought of being poor and just stuck. And I feel like I can't do a damn thing. And I was determined not to work retail again. I'm sure there are retail jobs out there I wouldn't hate, I just haven't found one yet. And it's not what I want for my career anyway. It's just a way to make money, even though it pays shit. ARRRGH. I'm just in such a foul mood and I can't seem to talk myself out of feeling "doomed" employment-wise.  Maybe I need to see a career counsellor.

      I start driving lessons this evening. I'm nervous. Well, not so much about the in-class lessons, just the in-car ones. I don't know when I'm doing those yet. I'm going to the place before the class starts so I can get all registered and stuff, so I guess I'll find out then. I finally got my actual G1 licence in the mail yesterday. It makes me so proud to actually have one of those glossy little blue flowery cards now. Finally I can stop dragging my passport around with me for photo ID ... a passport that's nearly expired and has no stamps in it because I only got it so I'd have valid ID.  I'm scared of actually driving, mostly because way back in grade seven family studies class when we had to sew I could never seem to control the pressure of my foot on the pedal. I was always pressing it too hard even when I put my foot down sooooo gingerly, and the sewing machine would go out of control. The family studies teacher was all "Oh, is that how you'll be when you're driving? Hitting the gas like crazy and killing everybody? I don't want to get in a car with you!" and she wasn't saying it in a teasing sort of way, she was really being pissy. Actually she was just a miserable woman in general. I remember when I was in grade six and we were making soup that had chicken stock in it, and my family and I were vegetarian at the time, so I told her I couldn't eat it, and she told me that they don't kill chickens to get chicken stock so I should eat it. I believed her too, because I was twelve and dumb and didn't think a teacher would lie to me, so I ate it and then found out the truth later that day from my parents. Goddamn woman had no respect for vegetarianism .. she also gave me a lower grade for not eating beef tacos we made one day even though I did cook them, but I wouldn't eat them because I was still vegetarian so she gave me a lower mark for "non participation", even though I told her the reason. She was like "Oh come on, you could've eaten just a little with the rest of the class!".  But anyway, back to the main thing, with the sewing machine pedal that was supposedly like the gas pedal in a car. So then after that I was afraid to drive.  Well, there was that, and also the fact that when I play arcade games like Crazy Taxi I am so unbelievably out of control and I can't steer straight and I panic. I know it's not like real life, but it still scares me. Maybe if I get behind the wheel of a real car I'll realize it's not like sewing or Crazy Taxi and I can relax a little.  Anyway, time to get moving.

      I found a bunch of places on a job search site that I want to e-mail my resume to, but Hotmail is being a frigid bitch and won't let me do anything right now.  Clearly I am not meant to be employed.  This whole e-mailing resumes thing, though, it's pretty cool. I don't have to make myself pretty or go anywhere or worry about how incompetent I look or whether I have pit stains or not.  Of course, I'm only doing this for job postings that don't provide an address at which to apply in person.  I have to wonder how many e-mail applicants these places get per day though. Maybe they get zillions and I'm wasting my time.  The thing is, though, the online jobs are mostly entry-level office/reception jobs, which I would much prefer to waitressing or retail, and they pay more too. Plus, although almost all of my work experience is in retail, an office job would make much better use of my skills.  Is there another way to apply for jobs like that other than online? Because most of them only seem to provide an e-mail address. I guess I should check the classifieds in the newspaper too.  If I can apply for any of these jobs in person, I am totally buying a power suit. Can secretaries wear power suits or is that obnoxious? I think I'll buy one anyway and wear it at home. I want to know how it feels.

      Boyfriend is off geeking it up at a cyber game tournament. He should be coming back soon.  I always get mad at him when he goes to these things because I am insecure and I start to think he likes Starcraft more than me. I went to one once and it was at this Japanesey-looking cyber cafe and I had to sit by myself for like ten hours or something drinking really expensive bubble tea that made me feel sick while he played his games or watched other people play their games or something. Periodically he would come back to the table where I was but he would talk about Starcraft stuff with his friend the whole time and I would pick at my hangnails. I was actually sort of envious because he had his geek thing that he was into, and it's cool to be a geek nowadays, and I'm not geeky enough to be cool, and I'm not cool enough to be cool either, I'm just me. For a while I thought maybe I was geeky cool because I wore blue-framed pretend glasses sometimes and I was into The Sims and Monkey Island and I had pet rats, but no one else thought that was geeky cool, they just thought it was dumb ... or creepy.  He just called me to tell me he's on his way home. Wheee!  I quit drinking coffee today and I'm all tired and useless and my brain doesn't work.

      So when I was coming here to log in I typed "blooger.com" by accident. I don't know why I find that funny. That's pretty juvenile, actually.  The boyfriend is here. He's in the bathroom dyeing his hair one of those Clairol dark maroony-plum colours.  I've decided that I am greedy and I want to make a lot of money at whatever I end up doing, so I'm going to take business courses and go corporate.  Well actually, going corporate is just a backup plan in case starting up my own business doesn't work out. Because if one more goddamn person over forty gives me that "90% of small businesses fail, you know" speech, I will have to throttle them. Goddamn dream crushers. So yeah, this way I have a backup, and I still only have to go to school for one thing.  You know what kind of people are really annoying? People who act all cutesy and precious all the time and speak with little Betty Boop voices and act all helpless, and then complain about how sick they are of being called "cute" all the time.

      So I got past that part in the book where I had to throw out fifty things. I didn't make it to fifty because I don't even think I have fifty things, and also because I threw a bunch of shit out a few weeks before I started reading that book again.  The part I'm at now is even harder though. Earlier I had to write down all these incompletions in my life that I'd like to finish, and then later I had to decide whether I would work on completing them now, later in the indefinite future, or never (meaning I make them complete by deciding that I'm finished with them because they're unecessary in my life). So now I have to look at all the ones I decided to work on completing now and I have to write down what I'm going to do to complete them and when I'm going to do it.  That's an absolutely awful chore. It makes me squirm. I have to set goals and deadlines .. auuuugh pressure! And some of them are so difficult to put time limits on .. like the one where I'm supposed to figure out what I want to do with my life. What am I supposed to do if I haven't figured that out by my deadline? Pick something and hope I don't hate it? I guess so. See, not doing this exercise means I can keep putting my life on hold. So I can't rightfully not do it, can I.  Not fair. Self-help books are supposed to make you feel all warm and fuzzy about yourself and give you an excuse not to do anything with yourself until you're done reading. What's with this whole "taking your life into your own hands" thing? Seriously.

      It's been like a ridiculously long weekend because my boyfriend had today and yesterday off.  It was fun, but right now when weekends come I feel like I'm escaping real life and it makes me all anxious and ill.  Also, I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. Do you know what you want to be? Are you being that yet? Can you help me?

      So none of the places I gave resumes to last week have called me, nor has the store I had an interview at on Friday.  I think the interview went sort of OK, but not fantastically. I have the retail experience, which the manager seemed pleased with, but I think maybe I made too much of a point of saying that I'm not an aggressive salesperson .. I dunno.  Oh well.  It's funny ... I've had nearly a year to just figure out what I want to do with my life and better myself, and I didn't do much of that, I just spun my wheels, and now that I have to go out and start working again I'm suddenly starting to really do all those things I was supposed to be doing before (ie. learning to drive, eating well, trying to figure out what kind of career I want to work towards, etc.).  When you feel like you have all the time in the world to do something, you end up just putting it off until you're suddenly under pressure. Or maybe that's just me.  So I'm at this part of the book I mentioned in the last entry that I think must be where I stopped reading a few years ago.  There's this exercise where you're supposed to throw out fifty things you no longer want/need/whatever.  It's hard because if I get rid of twelve pieces of clothing that don't fit or have holes or something, that counts as one thing, not twelve.  Gah. I think I've got to about ten or so so far.  The things you throw out don't have to all be physical things though.  You can "throw out" your grudge with someone for something they did to you years ago by calling them up and burying the axe or whatever.  I still don't know how I'm going to make it to fifty. I'm not really a person who holds grudges or anything like that, and all those intangible things are hard to throw out anyway, because you can  say  you've gotten rid of those thoughts or notions or whatever, but how can you be sure you really have?  You might think you've forgiven your friend who wronged you, but then find yourself stewing over it a few days later.  It's tricky.  Actually, I sort of wish I could throw away my mom's things. She's a clutter monster who holds onto way too much .. not because she's a packrat, but because she never gets around to getting rid of anything.  The other day I folded the laundry and she must have had at least thirty or forty pairs of panties in there, and those were just the ones I washed, she has more in her drawers. And yes, I do mean drawers. The woman has two dressers and a walk-in closet to accomodate all of her clothes, some of which she never wears, or can't wear because they need to be altered and they've been sitting there unaltered for a year or more.  Anyway, when I folded them and stacked them up it was like the Leaning Tower of Panties. And it's not like they were all nice panties.  Some of them were torn and threadbare.  She makes pretty damn good money too. She has no reason to hold onto these things.  I think I inherited this tendency from her, I'm just not as bad.  Actually, if I could I would throw away almost all of my clothes, but I can't, because I can't afford to buy new ones.  Anyway, I think I'm gonna go back to throwing things out.

      I passed my G1! I was away all long weekend and that's why I didn't write about it sooner. I know it's an easy easy test, but nevertheless I am so fucking proud of myself for finally getting off my ass and doing it. Now I can take lessons and I can learn to drive like a pro. When I have lots of money I'll get a Mustang convertible, maybe, or another hot looking convertible. But only if I live in Vancouver. Who the hell wants a convertible in stinky-as-shit Toronto? I don't get it at all. Anyway, that's eons away, most likely.  So the weekend, I dunno, I didn't enjoy it so much. We went to my boyfriend's friend's cottage and it was hot and sticky and mosquitoey and I almost lost their dog. He's this spastic little chihuahua who's never been fixed so he's always getting a boner and trying to hump your arm or leg, and also, he likes to attack people's feet when they're walking. So anyway, he was on a chain outside with everyone and then everyone went inside and I decided to go in too, but the dog was whimpering because everyone left. Usually they don't just leave him out there alone. So I decided to let him in by taking him off the chain and letting him in the house (I had done this before that weekend and it had worked just fine but I guess I wasn't supposed to), but then he just kept running. So I was chasing after him and calling him and the guy's dad was there and I said "Hey, the dog's running free!" and he said "Let him go, just let him go.", in the most unconcerned voice ever, so I took that to mean that the dog would be OK and he'd come back. So then maybe ten minutes later or less everyone was back outside and I said "Hey the dog's still gone" and my boyfriend's friend asked where he was so I told him what happened and he was like "why would you let him off the chain" and his mom said the same thing and she was flipping out, and I was trying to tell them I was sorry but also that their dad/husband told me to let him go and otherwise I would've gone after him. So we went off after him and they found him and everything was OK. I take responsibility for being stupid and thinking the dog would just come inside, but come on, why would his dad just say "let him go" and not tell anyone about the dog running off and make me think it was alright? And why did they not care that he said that? Why do I, someone who doesn't know what their dog is like or what he might do, get all the blame? Obviously I'm going to trust the guy who lives with the dog when he says "just let him go". So I was in tears for a while after that because if the dog had been run over or lost I never would've been able to forgive myself .. in fact it would have killed me, if his family didn't kill me first. So yeah, boyfriend's friend told me it was OK, mostly I think just because I was crying about it afterwards, but his mom didn't say anything. Everything is alright since the dog is OK, but still. That could've been a seriously traumatic thing for everyone. Stupid boyfriend's friend's dad. Stupid me, too.  Anyway, there were other reasons the weekend wasn't the greatest. One of the girls that came was really goddamn irritating and one of those know-it-all types who really doesn't know a whole lot and wouldn't shut up about anything. Like about the true definition of a nymphomaniac, or about Radiohead and how much she loved Pablo Honey and The Bends but how they've "sold out" and their new stuff "isn't them". I'm not exactly sure how someone can be selling out when they're putting out music that's far less catchy/anthemy and commercially successful than their earlier stuff, but those were her words. And Pablo Honey? Come on. She seriously thinks that fucking Pablo Honey is better than OK Computer or Kid A?  I can't even remember what any of the songs on Pablo Honey  sound like  besides Creep, that's the impression it made on me, and even Creep is nowhere near as good as any song on any other album by them. And this is after telling us earlier that day how much respect she has for Jessica Simpson, so you can imagine how much weight her opinion on Radiohead ought to have, so ordinarily I wouldn't even pay attention to someone like this, but like I said, she would not shut up. She got drunk and started rambling and quoting things Angelina Jolie's movie characters have said and thinking it was all so meaningful. She kept saying "He's a guy, he's a guy, he's a dick" over and over again, which she said was from Girl, Interrupted which I saw but I don't remember it well enough to be sure. And then that got her going about how sex is all guys are after and all guys are like this and all girls are like that and god, I fucking hate it when people say that all guys are such-and-such and all girls are so-and-so, it irritates me to no end. Yeah, maybe they're all like that because those are the only ones you associate with, because you meet them all in skanky meat market clubs or you just look and act a certain way and thus attract those shallow types .. and you yourself are attracted to these types you claim to hate so much. And I hate how I can't say "well I'm not like that" when someone says "women always [blah blah whatever]" because they just do a "yeah right, you're all alike and you all say you're different" type of thing, and I hate how I can't say "well my boyfriend's not like that" because then the girls who say that "all men are alike" think I'm some poor naive fool who hasn't seen her boyfriend's true colours yet or is making excuses for him. Eurgh. It's so infuriating. So anyway, yeah. She was annoying.  I'm trying to turn my life around completely. I want to figure out what I want to do and go out and fucking do it, and do it well, and do everything it takes to learn. I needed some inspiration so I picked up a self-help book I bought years ago but only read a little bit of called "In My Wildest Dreams" by Gail Blanke, and I'm reading it now. It's making me feel empowered. I know that sounds totally dorky, but I don't care.  So yeah, I'm gonna go back to reading that now.
