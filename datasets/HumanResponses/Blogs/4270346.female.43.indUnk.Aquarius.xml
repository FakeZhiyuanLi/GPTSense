       urlLink Dragon  This the sort of thing that makes you want to buy a nice pint for the  urlLink person  who turned you on to it. Or that could just be me.  If you are lucky enough to have a  urlLink killer local radio  station you may recognize the song.

        I thought this short was just bloody brilliant. I was shocked to find how buried in the dust it has become. If art is communication, then this succeeded on every level and did it with style!      urlLink Hailing Frequencies Issue #104 : "McNeill's 10-minute comedy is about a desperate man who hires 'the hitman of love' to afflict the object of his desire. But instead of a bow-and-arrow, the Cupid character wields a 9mm gun loaded with 'love bullets,' and the woman he follows thinks he's trying to assassinate her. The film was shot on the Paramount backlot over a weekend. '9mm of Love' features an appearance by Voyager castmate Ethan Phillips (Neelix). The woman pursued by Cupid is played by Liz Vassey, who appeared in Star Trek: The Next Generation as Kristin in 'Conundrum.' And according to McNeill's official fan club Web site, other Star Trek regulars make brief cameos in the film. "

        I am as foggy and gray as the weather. Out of practice for doing the club thing on a work night am I. Yawn………….      So it is suddenly time to start baring my soul on the WWW.  Why now? Why today? Why not, say after I have achieved some great goal or have a missive of monumental import to share?  Because.  Just kidding.  Because I keep journals. Yes plural. Subject journals. Event journals. An annual journal. Random thoughts and observations. Notes to self to follow up on when time allows (another joke). Bleeding heart whines about things that didn’t go my way. Blissful happy dances about things that make life better. And perhaps because I was at    urlLink  Jo Rowling’s     site     yesterday and it shook something loose.         More probably because I am lonely.        So about today’s mood. I would not call it down per se, but dull. I just don’t feel like my sparkly usual self. It is not just the late night. The $539 I spent to get my computer fixed could be a factor. Yes, it could be that after the first $251 I was told the system would work great. Wrong! I then had to turn around and pay the rest to someone else because the first person:       a. did not know what the hell he was doing    b. kept some or all of the new parts I paid for    c.  was someone I was involved with at the time he was ripping me off          It’s that last bit that really keeps harshing my groove ( cue sad, gypsy violins ). I was going to buy a loft bed; instead I got to buy computer parts I had already paid for.  I try to keep my emotional baggage light preferring to retain only souvenirs of the  Lessons Learned  and  Mistakes Needing No Repetition  variety. My keepsake from the aforementioned error in judgment was that you can  love  someone  very, very much  but be absolutely  incompatible  and therefore  miserable  with them. I didn’t find out that he had stolen from me until after we had parted. I miss his cat a lot and hope she is okay ( fade out violins, cross fade in happy psytrance ).  Enough time has passed that it is time to have a go at the    love thing    again.   After all, I enjoy time spent with my friends who are couples and I feel genuinely happy for them. I am optimistic that my baggage is in fact, quite light.        Yesterday I got an answer to a personals ad I responded too. I expected either:     Best Case Scenario  :  A cherub-like being with a crossbow or a   urlLink 9mm of love      has been at it again, life is ridiculously groovy and he says something like: Wow you look and sound just great, when can we talk?     Worst Case Scenario  :  Life when it’s your face hitting the pavement and he says something like: You have got to be kidding. Can’t you read? Go away and good luck. You’ll need it.  Which did I get?  damn the ground is hard         So I did what all self-respecting, reasonably intelligent, arguably attractive people do in the face of rebuff: I got dolled up (more or less) and went out on the town with an agenda of fun.  Okay, yes my friend’s band was playing at Blake’s in Berkeley last night and I  coincidentally  had already planned on going.  Heather, Jaimie and Isabel of    urlLink  Secret Synthi     were their usual amiable, entertaining and adorable selves. I shot a lot of pictures. I am just an art  student  so I am in practice, practice, practice mode. Being so bloody new and inexperienced, I am therefore quite reticent about my work. So I have added to the growing file of other shots of them, the    urlLink  Copper Tones     and of other folks that I have yet to properly review and present.    I   also went to see one of the other bands, having heard good things about them and having met one of the members a few weeks back. That first night he had been quite nice and he chatted me up. Very nice. Thought I would ask him out for coffee sometime, I did…last night he was…well second verse, same as the first.    Damn the ground is really hard.    I never got to talk with him.  He looked at me like all Bay Area people do when you say hello, as if some grievous social faux pas had been committed. Then he avoided all interaction - but not just with me mind you. You know the ‘I am an  Artiste  and far too good to be bothered with you lowly, unenlightened wastes of  My  space’ attitude. He certainly presented a very different and utterly unattractive person compared to the one I had initially met.      And I am starting to wonder which Love Divinity I have pissed off.      Yet it was an absolutely fabulous time out.  In addition to    urlLink  Secret Synthi     who put on a great show, I would like to t  hank      urlLink  Seven Oh Five     for    Skid Marks   . It is just  fantastic!     All throughout this tasty bit of independent cinema I was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my face and my sides hurt. I don’t know if I should say anything that may influence opinion or serve as spoiler material so I will just tell you this, if you get a chance to see anything by    urlLink  Seven Oh Five    ,   do it! This stuff is unbearably cool, beyond silly to the point of sheer brilliance.    Oh Man! I just found out from Heather that the Serious Fun started shortly after grandma dragged her sorry tush home to bed! Evidentially    urlLink  Chow Nasty     worked the crowd into a right frenzy and I missed Wild Cape Dancing and Co-ed Tambourine Spanking! People, I love to dance, especially silly, joyous dance! And I missed it so I could make it into the office on time this morning. Now I really feel old.  The Crown Heights are playing    urlLink  Blake’s     this Saturday. I have partied with them but have not seen them live. And since I just checked my email and there was the official reminder/invite from Ping himself, I guess I will get myself there. I now have four commitments on the 21st. They are spaced out throughout the day but… Oops. If I live, I think I will sleep through the 22nd.  Oh cool, the sun just broke through the fog. I mean the real sun and the real fog, not my personal fog. Yawn. Oh sorry, how rude, got to stop doing that. More yerba mate!  Well now there you have it.       A start to my life as a blogger.      And yes purists, I already know this is not a real Web Log since is has precisely nothing to do with the technical workings of the web.   But if it proves to be amusing to me and at least one other person, it will be worth it.       Of course if you want to read something that is  really  entertaining (and see the benchmark I aspire to), get your mouse scampering over to    urlLink   this        blog.

      Found this  urlLink silly test  in this  urlLink blog .  I'm John Stuart Mill (100%), Aquinas (97%), Jean-Paul Sartre (95%), Kant (87%), Aristotle (86%), Jeremy Bentham (85%), Epicureans (83%), Spinoza (79%), St. Augustine (78%), Stoics (75%), Cynics (69%), David Hume (69%), Plato (67%), Ockham (62%), Prescriptivism (61%), Nietzsche (60%), Nel Noddings (55%), Ayn Rand (51%) and Thomas Hobbes (45%) really?  Well this goes a long way toward explaining the little voices.

      Response to my personal ad is going spectacularly.   Spectacularly bad.  And  hell yes , it is making me tetchy so forgive me if I get any of my sour grapes on you.  Low to no response depending on the site and of those who do, I can tell that they aren't reading or just not comprehending what I wrote. Some are so far off the mark and so poorly written that I wonder how they manage to form complete sentences - let alone send email.  If you have ever had a personals ad and had to screen through the tragically desperate and/or obviously unbalanced, you understand my frustration. If it were remotely appropriate and held any chance of effectiveness something like, "no more knuckle draggers or bottom feeders, please" would appear prominently in mine.  Consider the time spent composing and editing a clear and sincere introduction. Then add the time to fill in all those little check boxes that are there to help define Who You Are and Who You Want - albeit in quantifiable and therefore generalized terms. Only then to hear from person after person who possesses none of your wants but is self-possessed with the audacity to send the equivalent of a hard sell sales pitch.  At least I don't get the really sick lewd offers too much anymore.  Conversely, I do read what others write and I am not finding a bleeping thing to respond to. Well there was that one ad but he said my reading and comprehension skills left a lot to be desired.   -- Being alone Sucks Out Loud (to use a term that I am alleged to be too old to use) for me right now because there is so much fun stuff to do. And yes, that is always true. While I am not letting my current lack of companionship keep me from it, it would be far sweeter shared with someone special.

      It was astonishing.  Yesterday evening I pulled from the mailbox a letter and check from the person who totally screwed up my computer - for the full amount I spent on  urlLink repairs .  Hark! What miracle caused him to suddenly find a conscience?  Did he actually have  feelings  (not merely over active hormones) where yours truly is concerned? Or was it the demand letter I sent stating my intent to sue him in small claims court?  Let us all send warm, fuzzy thoughts to the banking gods that the check actually clears.  I am very happy to have been reimbursed.  I am also deeply saddened by what for all intents and purposes is an admission of his guilt.  The previous sentence is based in part on the conversations shortly after his upgrades wherein my requests for help with new computer problems (where before there had been none) were dismissed as something I must be doing wrong. More to the point, it is based on the telephone conversation last week wherein I asked him point blank if he had ripped me off and he did not deny it. It is also based on his life philosophy that anything he does wrong or hurtful to someone else is okay because  he doesn’t mean it  that way.  Okay. That last part works if one is four years old and doesn’t yet know a good life choice from a plesiosaur ~or~ when one legitimately makes an honest mistake.  But not when one is a grown man who makes the same kinds of mistakes   serially  .  I don’t believe it is okay to behave unethically or illegally because you  choose  to not  perceive  it as such anymore than I believe that guy who says he can talk to the dead.  This self-proclaimed computer expert made the same kinds of mistakes with my PC as former stock broker Martha Stewart (who  unintentionally  conducted insider trading and  accidentally lied  to cover it up) made.    Yup.    Oh, my palm was itching again this morning just like it was yesterday afternoon. But I am expecting rebate checks for the computer parts I bought (but did not all actually make it into my system).    And given that writting this has caused a revist to the low-calorie hell that was a year and a half of my life, were it not for the fact that I am on my lunch break at work, I would go cry now.
