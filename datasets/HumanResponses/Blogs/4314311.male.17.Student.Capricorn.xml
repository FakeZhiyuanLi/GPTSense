      Well todays about over and it went over much better then yesterday. Everything is working outfine for me and Cassnadra as well as for my friend Ryan too. I've jsut spent the majority of today modeling, no not male camra modeling lol but 3d modeling in 3D Studio Max. I re-created a Star Wars blaster in 3d and then for my first atempt ever textured it. I think for my first atempt at texturing I did pretty well. The blaster is shown below! I hope I can keep up the good work and make more improvments since I'm taking up in teh field of 3d modeling for game design as well as  a minor in C++ computer programing. Well its about 2:00am and I think I may need to hit the sack so I'll post more tomarrow!

      Eh, saw my friend had one of these and I dont know what came over me but I just deicded to make one too. Guess it'll be a nice aplce to put my thoughts now and then. Maybe someone will see it! Lol *shrugs* who knows. But this first post is PROBABLY never going to see the light of day to anyone so why am I writing it? I do not know. Well I guess I can say stuff about today, which wasnt a good day, well it was a good day for about an hour or so lol then ti got bad :/.  Really all started going bad when I refused to goto a B-day party. My gf wanted me to go with her to the party...but frankly I'm a major party pooper and a no-fun person at parties. I guess that shocked somthign in my gf's mind cause now our relationship is on teh verge of break up...theres a whole long story to this so dont think she's over reacting or anything if anyone does read this. But whats upsetting to me is some of the things she said to my best friend which were true...and I'm sorry for not going and I hope I can get things strightened out between us. She's really the only person from around here that has liked me for who I was. Uh oh yes you guessed it im a computer geek gaming guru! But ne ways, she's been in my life for 6 months and all I can say is I thought the relationship was getting better as it all went on. But you knwo theres normal bumps and pot holes that need tending to and I've tried to tend to them and fix them up...I don't know how well I've been doing though but I hope I've been doing them in the right direction (which is the good direction). I just have to pray to god and hope I can come up with some way to fix this up. I'm not liek Anakin Skywalker tho, if I take somthign apart or break it I have a hard ass time putting it back together but I try, and normally that includes unothodoxed meothed (or in english, being weird lol). I do hope that things do get better.  Also I upset one of my best friends, which I shouldnt have but you know hwo stress anxiety and overwhlemingness for understanding and your own plain fuck ups can do right? Yeah well that happened a lot of it too I'm afraid, I just screw up to much when i try to fix things. Ever hammer in a nail and keep hitting your thumb? Well imagine hitting your hand at full speed each swing thats how bad im fucking up right now. I really just want to say I'm sorry to you both and that I want to make it up to either of you or both of you, if you want/allow me to.  Well its 2:35 am and my eyes are kind of fuzzy now and I can barley see, I hope I can get some sleep tonight...and I wish both my gf adn best friend goodnights as well. *Nyt Cassandra baby, I love you and please dont forget that I really mean it*.
