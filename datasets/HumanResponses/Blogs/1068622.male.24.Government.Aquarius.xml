      Some people believe that sleeping is a waste time.  They could be having fun and that doing anyting is simply better than sleeping.  Well, I disagree dammit!  If I could have 7 - 9 hours of guaranteed sleep everyday, I am fairly certain that I would be more productive.  After all, how many people who stay up all hours are actualy productive those night hours?  And to those who go to bed at 3 or 4 am,  what are you doing during those worthless hours?  Compare the person who gets up at 8am to the one who gets up 1pm.  You get about 100% more things done when you are up in the morning.  IMHO.

      A blog. What is a blog? Bitesize liver organ gestation? Clearly a ploy of human eating aliens. It is obvious what they want. The question is do you want to give it to them? I say yes. Although it will ultimately lead to all of our deaths, it is what they will least expect. That has to count for something.

      I try to think of Reloaded and Revolutions as one movie because that is what it is.  It is quite obvious that the movie was simply cut in half because they couldn't fit it into one long 3 hour movie.  First, I believe I can say that the first movie will always be my favorite.  It was the original, it was never thought of before, it was and still is incredible.  The 2nd and 3rd movies were also incredible.  We see more characters, more developments in an already captivating plot, better special effects and better action.  While I know there is a lot to understand about choice and cause and effect, I think from my first viewing of the conclusion it was made apparent to me that the machines were not just machines that have gone insane.  They were intelligent and alive and some were tired of the war and wanted it to end as the humans did.  The machines made a deal with Neo to end the war if he saved them from Smith and they kept their part of the agreement.  In addition, the argument of predicting or reasoning with pure logic or in contrast the emotion of love also was a great base plot element.  Also, a good point was made by one of my viewing friends that this movie did not have a 'Hollywood' ending.  Not everyone made it, characters we liked were killed.  To me, it makes it even more authentic and true to Wachowski bros. legacy.  It will be hard, but I hope these guys can continue to amaze us with future films.

      Well, finally it is here.  The Matrix Revolutions, the conclusion to the best sci-fi trilogy since Star Wars.  Best Sci-fi anything since who knows what.  I know that some people are watching it right now.  I almost took off work, but decided to see it with the rest of my friends in The Foamrat Collective.  Amazingly, I am a little worried.  I think I have hyped up this movie for myself more than any movie ever.  I know that it will likely live up to the hype, as Reloaded did.  The greatest thing about this third movie is the fact that I simply have no idea how it is going to conclude.  I can't believe I've had to wait 6 months!"

      Is that better?  Don't ask me because I don't know.  Did you know that Quiznos is awesome?  I had lunch there just now and I believe their subs (especailly the Classic Italian) are superior to all.  They have sale right now on the Itailian, thats the only reason I went because otherwise they are too darn expensive.  http://64.78.149.221/event1V1.asp  Hey also, that movie coming out today, 'The Day After Tommorrow,' looks pretty cool.  Basically Independence Day 2 except nature instead of aliens.  You know, you just have go in saying, I'm expecting great special effects and some cheesy personal moment scenes that I don't need but they are going to give me anyway.  Because the people who makes these movies feel guility for have so little plot they thrown one together real quick.  So, if you go in expecting that, then you should come out happy.  That is what I plan to do.    Also, I've read that pretty much all the stuff in this movie, could never happen, unless the laws of thermodynamics change.  When I say pretty much, I mean of course an ice age has happened before, but never so quickly.  Scientists don't believe an ice age will happen anytime soon either.  http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1941&u=/variety/20040526/va_fi_re/the_day_after_tomorrow&printer=1  http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/05/27/weather.movie/index.html  Peace.
