      For some odd reason I just can't stop playing the  urlLink Banana Phone Song.   It is so stupid yet I am drawn to it.  I think I have listened to it 5 times today.  Just call me a loon :p

       urlLink    Wo hen shuai ( I am handsome :) )&nbsp; urlLink     I finally got my haircut today, which was well past due(one too many curls).  I went to a place called the Greenwood academy.  It is a training salon that seems to be highly reputable.  I was lucky and got someone whose first day of cutting a real persons hair was  today.   She did a fairly good job, even though her teacher did a lot of it and it took about an hour.  She did happen to cut herself though.  The cut was nice( the hair cut not her cut), however the style was like something from the mid-80's.  But it was only $10.00, so I guess I can't complain.  Becca went their a few weeks ago and got someone that had been doing it for a little longer and she really liked it, so for the price we will most likely be going back.

      What a  urlLink Library!   The grand opening of the new Seattle Central Library was last Sunday, but it was too crowded to go.  So we went today and it is huge!  It has 5 floors with everything from a kid's room to a coffee shop (Starbucks of course) and a gift shop.  From what I hear it is being noticed internationally.  The inside was very open with awesome decorations.  Anyways I just could not believe it was a library from the outside.  Cool stuff I think.   urlLink    Inside the Library&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Seattle Library &nbsp; urlLink

      I have recently discovered that the library at school is a great place to nap.  I have about 2 hours between my classes and am usually very tired, so I put on my headphones, listen to a Chinese CD and take an hour of sleep.  I just hope I am not one those people that snore or talk in their sleep.  Wouldn't that be embarrassing?

      Well today was pretty much just another day at school.  My math (calc. I) is much harder than anticipated.  In my previous math classes it did not seem like you hade to really think about the problem, you just knew it or you didn't.  Now it takes a lot of brainpower.  For example, it takes my teacher about 1 hour to explain two problems.  Yet it takes me 2 hours two do one.  So far I have received a 90% and a 83% on tests in that class, so I guess I must understand something.  Chinese is going well.  I have a much harder teacher this quarter, but that is good.  It seems like I am learning a lot more now. Becca is doing very well in her Chinese class.  She gets A's on all of her assignments and tests.  I get really jealous sometimes at how good she is at it, but she does work very hard and earns what she gets.  I get a five-day weekend this week because UPS is on the slower part of the season and they asked if I wanted a couple days of this week.  I accepted with much joy because I need to catch up with my homework.  Not much is planed for us this weekend just schoolwork for now.  I did find out some bad news about school this summer.  The school I go to for some reason does not offer financial aid over the summer so I do not think I will be able to go.  It may be good because I might be able to get a second job for the summer and catch up on some bills.  Or I might just take one class.  I am just not sure.  Well I hope you all enjoyed this and look for a new post tomorrow.   "You must be the change you wish to see in the world." ---- Mahatma Gandhi

      Well finals are here again.  With only two weeks to go (including finals week and for Becca only one week) tests are coming at me from every direction.  I have a math test today, which I don't think I am ready for at all and in Chinese I will have a Quiz any day now.  Next week is going to be the killer, because in each class we are trying to rush through the last chapters.  I am sure I will make it, but if there are no posts for a couple of days then you know why.

      Ok, so we went down to the Space Needle to see the Folk life Festival, which was a lot bigger than I thought it would be.  As we were walking through we saw 3 people playing the violin and cello, so we stopped and watched because they were very good.  As we were watching two people walked right up in front of us blocking our view.  They did not say "excuse me" or "Can you see ok."  They just squeezed in around us.  So people please, remember to think about other people and have some etiquette at events.  Especially when Becca is in a grumpy mode and she is trying to listing to a string quartet.  I can't be held responsible for her actions.

      I think this Calc. Class is going to kill me.  I am so lost that no one will ever find me.  I am sure that I will make it through, but I have a test on Wednesday and I am still stuck on the 2nd section.  It looks like it will be nothing but Math for the next few days.  Sorry Chinese class, but I have no choice.  Anyways I just had to take a break from studying because my mind was turning into a well blended milkshake.  Now back to the fun!  This better be worth it :)

      Now not only do I not have a CD-ROM drive, but my networking card has gone out.  So we are down to one computer with the internet and it is a wireless one (sometimes in sometimes out).  And to top it off the router itself is being testy, so I need to see if Comcast will send me a new one. From what I hear the stuff I need is not too expensive, but it is just a pain in the butt especially at finals time.  Anyway, sorry about the rant, but I just needed to complain.

      Today was a pretty good day.  I did not have to go to work, so instead of doing homework we spent the day with Beccaâ€™s friend Justin.  We ended up on a ferry ride to, well I can't remember.  Anyway other than being a little cold it was awesome.  The view was really cool from all sides and the sunset was remarkable.  I just wish we had brought our camera so I could have posted some pictures.  We will most likely be going on it again over the summer because it only cost about $5 a person both ways if you don't get off.    Before the fairy ride we went to the film festival here that was showing Hero, a Chinese movie.  We had already seen it on DVD because we knew someone that had bought it from china, before Miramax bought the rights and stopped producing it until it has gone to the big screen.  The cinematography in it is spectacular, the plot was awesome and the fight scenes were some of the best.  In some ways it was better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  I would highly recommend this movie to be watched on the big screen especially if you liked Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  That was pretty much our day today.  We did go play some pool with one of Justinâ€™s friends and go to Pikes Place as well.  All in all it was a fun day and a much needed break from school.

      It is the last week of class and it is going to be busy.  In my Chinese class we are going to try and get through one more lesson in this last week.  Usually it takes about 1 1/2 weeks to finish one, so there is going to be a lot to do.  I am hoping that there will only be one more test in my math class, but I am not sure since we have already started the last lesson.  On the other hand it would be nice to have two more tests so that I can bring up my grade, because I did very badly on the last test.  I am hoping that UPS will not need me much this week so they will call me and tell me I don't need to come in.  That way I can concentrate on my school.

      Hello everyone, it's Becca and I'll be doing the posting today since John Michael's busy with his Chinese.  I also should be busy - I have a final paper due tomorrow in my History of Modern Ethics class - but at this point I don't think there's any possible way that I could be any less interested in Immanuel Kant.  I think my brain's already on summer break.  So now I'm stalling.  I'm finding myself lately speaking more and more like a philosophy major ("No, John, that doesn't necessarily imply that..." and "This doesn't provide a necessary and sufficient condition...").  I feel sorry for John; he couldn't win an argument if he wanted to because he doesn't have a clue what I'm saying.  Sometimes I wonder if I do.  In other news: Ronald Reagan passed away (today? yesterday?); Justin's in town but I have yet to see him; my last final's on Wednesday and I'm not even remotely prepared (only two more years of school yay); John and I are both itching for a little time to recooperate, to take back our mental and physical health.  The end of the quarter is so stressful, and the week after finals is such a letdown that all we do is like sleep for a week straight.  I'm so excited about my extended nap that I'm having difficulty focusing on the task at hand!    Zai jian!  Becca

      School is over and what a relief.  The bad news is I am not sure that I did too well on my finals.  It is so nice to not have anything, but work, to worry about now.  Also I am looking for another part time job.    Becca is also not going to school over the summer because she wants to go to China, through her school, this summer for about 3 weeks.  So she had to choose between school or China because her financial aid would only cover one.  She is still not sure if she will be able to go, but we are trying our best to scrap together money because this would be a great experience for her.  In the mean time she is looking for a summer job to help pay for it.  As far as grades go here is what Becca received, she did very well: Chinese - 3.9 History of Modern Ethics - 3.7 Ethics - 4.0  By the way the Ethics class was a 400 level class and she got the best grade in the class.  I am very proud of her.  As for me, I won't get my grades until next week.

      It is the day before finals and I don't think I will be able to fit any more information in my head.  I took the day off today in order to study and I have been at it all day, give or take a couple breaks.  I still don't think I am nearly ready for either of my tests, mainly because I think I slacked off too much this quarter.  But I will do my best and I have vowed to try harder next quarter (Fall Quarter).    Now I am watching Last Comic Standing to try and relax a little so that I can study some more.  This is a very funny show.  I watched last year and I really enjoyed it.  That is all for now, back to the studying.

      This was a highly imaginative and very entertaining movie.  Becca and I both really enjoyed it.  Seeing it on the IMAX made it that much better.  J.K. Rowling has a great imagination; I only wonder how they are going to keep the same kid playing Harry potter after the 90 movies are made.  Despite the bad reviews I heard that it got, I thought it was very good.

      On Friday I had the day off and we decided to go see a movie.  Harry Potter was playing at the IMAX, which sounded like fun so we decided to go there.  The show started at 7:30pm, so we got the bus schedule to get there.  As the bus was turning on to the free-way we noticed the traffic was completely stopped.  By the time we got downtown we had missed the movie.  We were bummed, but decided to go see something else, however nothing good was playing or worth paying $20 for.  We decided to try and see Harry Potter yesterday. Well we made it down there, even with bad traffic, but they were sold out.  We were determined to see this movie so I bought tickets for today yesterday and now we just have to make it there in time.  We are leaving a couple hours early just to be sure.  Anyways I am not sure if we were meant to see this movie or not, but we are going to do everything we can to see it and it better be worth it.

      Sorry that I have not been posting much lately, but to be honest our lives are rather boring.  All I have been doing for the last week is going to work and looking for another part time job.  I do have to say that my work has been rather brutal.  It seems that I am the last to leave each day.  Yesterday I had to unload this truck that was full of boxes that were about 4ft X 6ft X 4in and they were all about 60 lbs.  Let me just say they were a pain in the butt.  This was at the end of the night and the last trailer on. Thatâ€™s work for you though.  Becca has a job for the next couple of dayâ€™s just making photocopies, so by the time I get home she is in bed and I am still sleeping when she wakes up.  Other than that we have not had the time to do much of anything.    Tomorrow is our 5th wedding anniversary.  I think that we are just going to go on a ferry ride to celebrate due to our funds being a little tight now, but it will still be a lot of fun.  We are also going to see one of our friends and their new baby boy.  That should also be very fun.

      Now that school is out I have too much time on my hands.  I really hope I can find another job soon; otherwise I am liable to go crazy.  Well not really I do actually enjoy the time.  However this weekend I kept on thinking I had studying to do, but there was none at least not of too much importance now.  The only studying I am going to do is to learn the zip codes for UPS so I can become a sorter and make a dollar an hour more.  I am also going to try and keep up on my Chinese and review my math for next quarter.  Other than that I am free!! for now at least.

      Becca is now a little closer to going to China this summer.  We have bought the tickets and I think that we found a pretty good deal.  She will be leaving on August 20th and will be returning on the 17th of September.  The flight, including layovers, is about 16 hours.  Now we just have to work her passport and visa.  I think that she is going to have a great time there and she of course is very excited.  I still don't know what I will be doing over that time, most likely watch a lot of movies.

      I was not able to post anything this weekend because for some reason my parents computer would not stay connected to the internet when I tried to publish a post.  So here is what happened over the weekend:   Saturday :  We got up at 5:00am this morning, after going to bed at 1:00am last night, so that we could catch the greyhound bus.  First let me say that I thought that the greyhound would be a nice and relaxing way to travel since we do not have a car.  Well I was wrong.  We had to get to the station an hour early to get our tickets, which was not too bad.  But then we got on the bus.  As we got on we noticed that the seats were packed together like sardines and that were left out for a few days.  Luckily we were the first stop so we got a seat together.  However someone on the bus had something emitting from their body that was like rotten eggs.  Other than that the bus ride went ok with the 6 stops and 4 1/2 hrs to get to Vancouver.  Once we got into Vancouver my parents picked us up and took us out to lunch, which was really fun.  Then we went to their house and saw Hunter, who we have been missing very badly.  We then took a trip up to their property, with the dogs.  While there Clair put me to work climbing trees and stringing a line across part of their property.  He also brought his new toy, a chainsaw.  So I had my first experience cutting down a tree.  It was fun until Clair was cutting one down and it started to fall the wrong way and I jumped into a blackberry bush by mistake to avoid it (it ended up going the right direction though).  After a couple of hours there we went back to their house and played some games, drank margaritas, and had some BB-Q.     Sunday   Fourth of July :  Today was another fun day.  We got up and hung around the house for a bit and then decided to go play some miniature golf.  The course was fun and a little challenging.  Needless to say Clair the golfer won both rounds.  The sun was out that day and most of us got a little burned due to not seeing the sun much.  We then went home and played some Uno Attack, this game can take quite some time to finish.  Becca and I made nachos, which is our cheap student meal, that were very good if I do say so myself.  As for fireworks we did not want to go to Fort Vancouver because it gets so crowded that you can't breath.  So we decided to look and see if we could see them from somewhere else.  We found a really nice spot on the Oregon side of the Columbia and it had a really nice view.  The only problem was that is was very windy and cold, but fun none the less.  We went home after the 40min fireworks and played with some of our own.  That was about it for the 4th.   Monday :  Today Clair and I got up early to go up to the property because they were going to break ground today.  It was really neat to see how the guy started to level out the property and to see how powerful a bulldozer is.  There were many rocks in the way, but that did not seem to matter.  We only got to stay for a little while because we had to get back to catch the greyhound home.  I have to say that the trip home was worse than the trip there.  This time we were not the first stop, so there was very limited seating.  We had the privilege to sit next to the stinky toilet.  There was also a lady that liked to talk really loud in her cell phone and yell at her kids.  There was another guy in front of us that could not sit still and had to have his seat fully reclined back.  That did not help me study for a sort test I have on Tuesday for work.  This trip took about 45min longer than the last due to traffic.  While on the bus we found out that there was an express bus we could have taken.  That did not make us feel good.  But we made it home at last and went to bed very early, after we took a shower from being on the bus.  All in all the trip was well worth it and we had a lot of fun seeing my parents and I hope everyone else had a wonderful 4th as well.  Also while Becca is in China I am going to try and go to help Clair work on the house, if I can get the time off.

      So we went to the  urlLink &nbsp;Bite of Seattle  today.&nbsp; I think it was more about a half a pound of Seattle because there were tons of people there.&nbsp; It was still fun though.&nbsp;There were performers on five different stages, all kinds of different ethnic foods at reasonable prices, and some arts and crafts.&nbsp; It was a fun experience, but way to many people there, especially by the food stands. We got a whole coconut, that was not as good as the fresh ones from Hawaii.&nbsp; We also tried some fried bananas, much better than the ones we tried in Nicaragua.&nbsp; All in all we had a good time there.

      For the past few weeks Becca's back has been giving her some grief.&nbsp; She is going to set up another appointment to see the doctor today.&nbsp; She has also been going to a massage therapist once a week, but it does not seem to be helping.&nbsp; Hopefully the doctor will be able to figure out something to help because she is in a lot of pain.&nbsp; So please everybody keep her in your thoughts.

      I have decided to go down to Vancouver to help Clair and my mom on building their new house.&nbsp; I will be going while Becca is in China.&nbsp; So I took three weeks off of UPS and will leave on August 20th, the same day as Becca.&nbsp; I think that they are just now pouring the concrete for the foundation.&nbsp; So I am not sure if they will still be working on the framing, but whatever it is it will be a nice change from UPS.&nbsp; I think that this time I will be taking the Amtrak to get down there due to my last experience on the Greyhound.  &nbsp;  As for Becca's trip to China, we sent off to get her passport changed and to get a visa.&nbsp; After we get that back there is not much left to do to get ready, except buy some clothes and miscellaneous stuff.&nbsp;

      In addition to seeing Spiderman 2 we went t to eat at the Bamboo Garden, to celebrate our 5 anniversary a little late.  I do not think I can say this enough, but this is the best Chinese food I have ever eaten and it is completely  urlLink vegan .  I do not know how they do it but it is wonderful.  I think it is better than the real thing.  If you are ever up in Seattle you will have to try it.

      We saw Spiderman 2 this weekend and I had high hopes for this movie.  Well the movie came through.  The effects and story line were both great.  I want to start reading the comic books now to see how close the movies are to them.  I would highly  recommend  seeing this movie in the theater if you have a chance.

      I am not the best film critic, but here it goes.&nbsp;  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy  was not quite as good as the  urlLink first , but it was still very good.&nbsp; The action scenes were better, but the story was not as good.&nbsp; The filming at the beginning of the movie was a little sporadic, but I seemed to get used to it.&nbsp; Overall&nbsp;this movie was well worth seeing in the theater and I really enjoyed it.

      It has become VERY hot here in Seattle.&nbsp; Right now it is only 85 degrees and it&nbsp;will&nbsp;reach about 95 degrees today.&nbsp; I know some of you are probably laughing at that and thinking that it would be nice to be that hot.&nbsp; However, we here in Seattle do not like the sun.&nbsp; What makes things worse is that we live on the 6th floor and have no air conditioning.&nbsp; All we have is a small fan.&nbsp; Becca just checked the thermometer in the house and it is 93 degrees in here.&nbsp; We have the lights out and are afraid to watch any T.V. because it&nbsp;might put out too much heat.&nbsp; Anyways enough complaining for now I have to go to work soon. &nbsp;By 6:00pm my clothes will be completely soaked with sweat in the&nbsp;100+ degree trucks.&nbsp; I drink tons of water there yet never have to go to the bathroom because I sweat it all out.  If anyone has any tricks to keep the house cool let us know :)&nbsp;

      Yes today is my birthday, well in about&nbsp;five minutes it will be just another day, but for now it is my birthday, however only for another&nbsp;five minutes, not&nbsp;four minutes just five, it could be three, but obviously that is too little and of course&nbsp;six or&nbsp;seven is out of the question, don't even think about it lasting&nbsp;ten because that is insane.&nbsp;   Anyway I had to work today but it was not too bad.&nbsp; Becca had a small little party for the two of us when I got home.&nbsp; She made some Riblets (vegan of course) and mashed potatoes, put up some streamers and balloons, and made a cake.&nbsp; It was small but fun and tasty.&nbsp;   We are going to go to Vancouver this weekend and I am going to help Clair work on their house.&nbsp; He has also graciously agreed to loan us their extra car until Becca gets back from China.&nbsp; Of course I said I would come down every weekend to help him on the house until Becca leaves.&nbsp; Then I will be there for three weeks helping.&nbsp; We are going to take the  urlLink Amtrak  down there and will take the car home.&nbsp;   Well I need to go to bed because it is 12:05am and it is no longer my Birthday.

      We are moving once again, but not far.  We found out on the 4th that there was an opening in the on  urlLink campus married housing .  It is much cheaper and closer to  urlLink UW .  Our  urlLink apartment  that we are in now was very nice to let us out of our lease to get the new apartment.  We had just signed a new lease about a week ago and I did not think that they would let us out of it.  Anyway now we have to pack and move out by the 20th before me and Becca both leave for our trips.  It will be tough, especially since we are going down to  urlLink Vancouver  to help with the house every weekend, but I think we can do it.  The new apartment that we will be moving into is on the first floor, comes with all utilities paid, free satellite (Although I think that might be a distraction), free Ethernet and phone service.  The only problem is that there is no  urlLink washer and dryer  in the apartment, but there is one onsite.  Anyway that is our fun for the next few weeks, and once again we are on our way down to  urlLink Vancouver  after I get off  urlLink work  tomorrow at about 10:00pm.  Wish us luck!  And I hope you like all the links ;)

      This weekend was a busy one.  We went down to Vancouver (notice I said down, so that would imply Washington not B.C.)  on Saturday via Amtrak.  I was very surprised by the Amtrak.  It was clean fast and much better than the greyhound.  It even had an on track movie.  We arrived at about 10:30am and by about 12:00pm Clair and I were off to start on the house.  We spent about 4 hours there and it did not seem like we got much accomplished, however neither of us have done construction in quit some time.  At about 6:00pm we headed back home and went to this really good Mongolian grill place for a late birthday dinner.   The next morning we left for the house around 7:00am and stayed until about 6:00pm.  We accomplished a lot more that day.  By the end of the day we had all of the exterior pony walls (I think that is how you spell it like the animal "pony") done and some drain pipes for the gutters.   We drove back home today and arrived here in Seattle at about 1:30pm.  At 4:00pm I had to leave to work at UPS.  But the day is almost over and I am looking forward to next weekend where I get to go and help with the house again.  I will try to get some pictures of it next time.
