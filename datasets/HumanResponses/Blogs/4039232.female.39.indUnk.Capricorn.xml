       Some of the news isn't appalling. It's simply about how appalling the news is. I'm including a must-read editorial by Paul Krugman from the NYT. If you don't religiously read Krugman (twice a week, every week) then register for the online times and just do it. Bob Herbert is also good. Kristof and Dowd are excellent; Kristof tends to raise issues about how we fail to notice tiny things like genocide in Sudan, and Maureen Dowd writes great essays, but ends them terribly. I'm not sure why this bothers me so much, but it does. I always feel like I've missed a page when I get to the end of one of hers.   Amy Goodman in a Democracy Now! interview gets a similar meta-news thing going with Ted Koppel.&nbsp;Lots of good news about news articles on the democracy now home page...&nbsp;&nbsp;     urlLink  Triumph of the Trivial     By PAUL KRUGMAN  Published: July 30, 2004  Under the headline "Voters Want Specifics From Kerry," The Washington Post recently quoted a voter demanding that John Kerry and John Edwards talk about "what they plan on doing about health care for middle-income or lower-income people. I have to face the fact that I will never be able to have health insurance, the way things are now. And these millionaires don't seem to address that."   Mr. Kerry proposes spending $650 billion extending health insurance to lower- and middle-income families. Whether you approve or not, you can't say he hasn't addressed the issue. Why hasn't this voter heard about it?     urlLink  ABC's Ted Koppel Refuses To Apologize For Pre-War Iraq Coverage     Koppel tells Democracy Now!, "I don't think an apology is due.

       Honestly.   I had the idea for this blog because I used to print out all the horrifying news stories every day and file them away so I could, sort of like Mel Gibson in Conspiracy Theory, track the decline of our country page by page. I could find dozens every day that were subtle but connectable, (but, c'mon, earthquakes in Turkey? Puhleeze.)   I'm having problems this week. The news is all about the convention, which is as spontaneous and newsworthy as the farm report. Hey, I'm a democrat, and I'm not even buying into this love fest.   In any case, I've asked friends to send in some good candidates, and I got a few:    APPALLING NEWS      urlLink  CEO pay hikes double     NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - The CEO's at the nation's largest companies saw their raises more than doubled in 2003 as the median raise handed out by S&P 500 companies to their top executives was 22.18 percent, according to a study by The Corporate Library.     and yet...     urlLink  Americans' incomes fell for two years     NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Americans' overall income shrank for two consecutive years after stocks plunged in 2000, the first time that has effectively happened since the current tax system was put in place during World War II, according to a published report Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;    FORK      &nbsp;   urlLink  This isn't strictly NEWS    (due to it's not being new) but I'm&nbsp;vaguely shocked that these things no longer qualify for "News of the Weird."&nbsp;         &nbsp;

       I'm trying to keep a record of all the news items each day that I run across that I find absolutely appalling. Either because they individually make me want to stick a fork in my eye, or because taken together they provide a panoramic snapshot of our daily descent into "the government formerly known as democracy".     &nbsp;   It's hard to know how best to record these, since some of these sites require registration, and for others, in 2 weeks, many of these news items will be archived and available only for a fee, so I'm going to try a few ways of documenting abstracts without taking away from the impact of the big picture.     &nbsp;   Why do I try to explain these things in so much detail? I don't know. Screw it. I'm doing it this way now. If I change it, just follow along.     &nbsp;    urlLink Computer glitches lost voting data      urlLink Lost Record of Vote in '02 Florida Race Raises '04 Concern &nbsp;- MIAMI, July 27 - Almost all the electronic records from the first widespread use of touch-screen voting in Miami-Dade County have been lost, stoking concerns that the machines are unreliable as the presidential election draws near.     The records disappeared after two computer system crashes last year, county elections officials said, leaving no audit trail for the 2002 gubernatorial primary. A citizens group uncovered the loss this month after requesting all audit data from that election.&nbsp;     Similarly:   urlLink Fear of Fraud &nbsp;- Paul Krugman&nbsp;- NYT  It's election night, and early returns suggest trouble for the incumbent. Then, mysteriously, the vote count stops and observers from the challenger's campaign see employees of a voting-machine company, one wearing a badge that identifies him as a county official, typing instructions at computers with access to the vote-tabulating software.     When the count resumes, the incumbent pulls ahead. The challenger demands an investigation. But there are no ballots to recount, and election officials allied with the incumbent refuse to release data that could shed light on whether there was tampering with the electronic records.     This isn't a paranoid fantasy. It's a true account of a recent election in Riverside County, Calif., reported by Andrew Gumbel of the British newspaper The Independent.     urlLink White House to Project Record Deficit  - By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON — The White House will project soon that this year's federal deficit will exceed $420 billion, congressional aides said, a record figure certain to ignite partisan warfare over President Bush's handling of the economy.     &nbsp;   FORK   urlLink  Husband walks in on 9/11 scam of 'widow,' cops say   -  ROCKFORD, Mich. -- A woman who collected more than $70,000 from the Red Cross after claiming her still-living husband died in the Sept. 11 attacks has been accused of fraud, authorities said.     The scam fell apart when Donna Miller's husband walked in while a detective was interviewing her at home, authorities said. Miller, 49, of Sparta, was charged Thursday with three felony counts of false pretense and released on $10,000 bond.

The alarming rise, which includes figures showing rates of dementia have trebled in men, has been linked to rises in levels of pesticides, industrial effluents, domestic waste, car exhausts and other pollutants, says a report in the journal Public Health.

       I just pulled this first batch of today's list straight from the dem-daily, the newsgroup from   urlLink  democrats.com   , 'cos I'm lazy, but I would have found the same stuff had I dug for it...      urlLink  Bush Must Condemn the Swift Boat Lies About John Kerry    "To George W. Bush: As Jim Rassman writes, '35 years after the fact, some Republican-financed Swift Boat Veterans for Bush are suddenly lying about John Kerry's service in Vietnam... This time their attacks are more vicious, their lies cut deep and are directed not just at John Kerry, but at me and each of his crewmates as well. This hate-filled ad asserts that I was not under fire; it questions my words and Navy records. This smear campaign has been launched by people without decency, people who don't understand the bond of those who serve in combat... Sen. McCain called on President Bush to condemn the ad. Regrettably, the president has ignored Sen. McCain.' As a candidate, you promised to 'be a uniter, not a divider' ... 'restore honorand integrity to the White House' ... and 'change the tone in Washington.' We therefore call onyou to condemn the lies by your supporters about John Kerry's Vietnam medals." Sign the petition!      urlLink  Truth v. Swift Boat Liars    eRiposte writes, "Many media outlets have been providing a relatively easy outlet for the so-called 'Swift Boat Veterans for Truth' (SBV for short; more appropriately described as theSwift Boat Veterans Who Have a Problem With The Truth or as Swift Boat Veteran Flip-Floppers for Bush or as Smear Boat Veterans for Bush). Since the media continues to parade these folks(fondly and appropriately described by Hesiod as 'Swift Boat Liars for Bush') before viewers, often without critically examining their egregious charges against Senator John Kerry (some media outlets are far worse than others on this), I wanted to get a clear picture for myself on what is being said and what is really the truth. What emerges is simply the fact that this is the beginning of Part II of The Hunting of the President." This is an amazing compilation of the details of Kerry's medals that counters the SBV's smears.      urlLink  Boston Globe One of the Few US Media Sources to Accurately Report Kerry 'War Authorization' Story    Bush laid an ambush for Kerry this week, one in which the AP obviously colluded. Bush asked:''My opponent hasn't answered the question of whether, knowing what we know now, he would havesupported going into Iraq." Kerry answered he would have still voted to authorize thepresidential power to declare war (reason: in a case of impending attack, there may not be timeto convene Congress). A.P. and subsequently every other US news outlet reported falsely thatKerry said he would have voted to go to war even knowing there were no WMDs and that theintelligence was wrong. Kudos to the Boston Globe!          APPALLING FORK    urlLink  Gas Drilling in Colorado's Wildlands    The Bush administration is finalizing a gas-drilling plan that would send roads and drill pads slicing through southern Colorado's HD Mountains, the only remaining stretch of the San Juan Basin untouched by energy development. Covering 40,000 acres, the old-growth ponderosa pine forests of the HD range provide habitat for elk, black bears, northern goshawks and mule deer. Rich archeological sites in the area date back 1,000 years. The administration's coalbed methane plan calls for drilling 79 wells and constructing compressor plants and 36 miles of roads in this unspoiled lowland forest in violation of the "roadless rule," which is designed to protect the wildest areas of our national forests from development. For only a tiny amount of gas, the project would decimate nearly 90 percent of the HD Mountains' old-growth stands, leave mountain streams cloudy with sediment, disturb archeological sites and uproot wildlife.       and... finally... what's become of our War On Drugs?   urlLink  U.S. Customs Seizes Drug Shipment To Senior Citizens    No, silly, Uncle Ralph isn't looking for smack, he's just trying to keep his blood pressure down...

Ireland has sheep in it." Yes, yes, I know. I'm actually highly educated, and there's no reason for this. I can't help it. In my spinal cord, Ireland is still in, like, the 1600s.)

       Ok, maybe I'm just a sick fuck, but every time I see that Stacker 2 ad - you know, the one where the guy couldn't get into the Navy until he lost 60 pounds? - I think it would make a great SNL anti-war ad.       "Hi, I wanted to get into the Navy, but they wouldn't take me until I lost some weight, so I got on Stacker 2, and started working out, and I lost 60 pounds, and the next thing you know, my dream came true and I was being shipped to Iraq where I lost another 60 pounds when my leg got blown off. Buy Stacker 2 now and lose all the weight you want...."      I'm sure that's really wrong, but I think it EVERY time I see it...

       I'm trying to keep things relatively safe over on the daily guilt site (in case someone serious decides that I'm publishable and doesn't want to know that I talk about non-PG-13 things) even though I've already used the word "fuck" throughout it. So I've decided to create a new, unexpurgated version, so I can feel comfortable discussing other things less socially acceptable, but oddly still of interest to me. Perhaps "of interest" is a strong phrase. What I really mean is, "things I think about in the last microseconds before I fall asleep that wake me up and make me ask my bed-buddy really stupid questions."       So, last night's pre-slumber query was, "do all guys refer to their penises as male?"       The response was, (and fairly so), "Huh!?"       "You know, if you were to refer to your penis, would you call it a 'he'?"       "Go to sleep."       "No, really, I'm curious."       "'He' as opposed to what?"       "It? She? I don't know."       "Well, I guess in jest I might refer to it as 'he'..."       And this was what I was getting at. At some level, whether it's in jest, commonly, occasionally, or all the goddamn time, men anthropomorphize their penises. Whereas I don't think I have EVER considered my genitalia as any sort of separate entity. My clitoris is not a "she". It's an "it". Hell, it's often referred to as "the little man in the boat" - definitely not female. And my vagina has got the added difficulty of being an "emptiness", or an "anti-object" which makes it even harder to personify. You can hardly imagine anyone ever saying "My vagina thinks you're cute," while "My little buddy would like to get to know you better..." just sounds like a bad line some guy might try.       What is with this?       Am I totally off base? Do other women give their genitalia names? Do they talk about them as if they were jogging partners? Or is it really just men? And is it all men?       I need comments on this one. Also feel free to answer the question "Fold or crumple?" Be sure to include your gender...       (quick note: I have been informed that my barista knows at least 4 women who've named their "hoo hoo"s Ethel.) (Other quick note: I got "hoo hoo" from the movie "Boys on the Side". I promise it's not something I would have come up with on my own. But since this is the unexpurgated site, I probably should have just said pussy.)

       shazam.       I once (during grad school, probably between rounds of Tetris) wrote a fortran program (like Latin, a dead language) to take a pre-existing document as input, create a tally of word, word length and letter frequencies, and spit out a new, random document a) using real words with the same word frequency, or b) using randomized words with the same word length and letter frequency.       As it had no obvious astronomical purposes, let's just say I was "off-duty".      It really didn't have  any  purpose when I wrote it, I was just dicking around, but eventually I used it to generate random words when I was trying to think of a name for my new embryo. It was actually a great brainstorming tool because I came up with Wyld and Wolf, names that would never have occured to me otherwise. Names that I apparently would never use, either, since my kid's name is Zachary, so, well, whatever. Nonetheless, it was a project that I remember, and I sort of wish I still had the programming capacity to rewrite it in a new language, 'cos it would be cool. You know. For dicking around with.      Now it turns out that someone obviously got hold of it and input all documents ever written and all conversations ever spoken in English because I just got a link to a great site that graphically displays the top 86000-ish most frequently used words in the English language.   urlLink  www.wordcount.org   . Ok, maybe they have a different way of figuring out frequencies than I did, but I still like it.      Because I'm on this word frequency/lack of programming skills roll now, I'm reminded of another project that I wish I could do but can't because while other people were learning C and C++ I was maintaining legacy code in FORTRAN and I never had time to keep up and whine whine whine oppression oppression oppression. Anyway, I want to be able to take a document - say, the transcript of a Bush press conference, or the song lyrics to "I Miss that Bitch" - and turn the words into fridge poetry units, so you can, duh, make fridge poetry out of it.       Think of it:      oppressed terror rising    while this nation feels relief    having passed challenging drugs    across our borders      I mean, how cool would that be?      Someone help me here...

       Today I woke up to junk mail from the W himself. Ick. The temptation to rewrite was strong, since yesterday's Cheney mail was so damn fun, but I couldn't make it all the way through W's original without wanting to just vomit.   So, instead I read a few good editorials from Paul Krugman   urlLink  from the NYT   , Ron Reagan in a   urlLink  piece in Esquire   , and some guy I don't regularly read in the   urlLink  UK's Guardian   . (speaking of vomit...)   [ed. note: Just to clarify - I do not relate the Guardian directly to vomit. It's just that the article suggests that maybe letting Bush win so that he can "clean up his own vomit" might be a good idea. Personally, I think like any alcoholic, Bush would look at his own metaphysical vomit (i.e., the state of the country/world/economy/etc.) and turn around and order another drink, so I'm not in complete agreement with the author of the vomit article, but it was something to think about...]

       I don't know how it happened, but I ended up on a republican email distribution list a few years ago. I never bothered to cancel it because a) I figured responding would just get me spammed by dozens of other unwanted republican sites, and b) it was kind of interesting to see what kind of propaganda they were sending out.     &nbsp;   Today I got a Letter from Vice Fucking President Cheney. It wasn't signed "Vice Fucking President Cheney", but we all know that's what he meant, and, dammit, it made him feel damn good thinking it.     &nbsp;   Anyway, the text is as follows. Since he obviously&nbsp;omitted a few things, I've gone ahead and fixed it up for him. I've highlighted my edits in yellow:     &nbsp;   Dear Laurie,     &nbsp;   This week Democrats have gathered in Boston to attack our President and nominate the most liberal ticket in history,  that is,   if you've smoked so much crack that you've&nbsp;forgotten, say,&nbsp;Mondale/Ferraro, or maybe McGovern/Shriver . As they spread their&nbsp;pessimistic  but accurate  message  about how our democracy is spiralling into the void , we need your help to set the record straight.     &nbsp;   When you talk to your friends and neighbors about this campaign, remind them that President George W. Bush has led us from a recession to the fastest growing economy in the  third  world and 1.5 million new jobs  each   paying&nbsp;a lot less than the 3.7 million jobs that have been lost since he took office, not to mention the increase in long-term unemployed from 10.9 to 19.5 million&nbsp;over the course of his presidency .&nbsp; Remind them that when terrorists brought war to our homeland, President Bush has led a relentless campaign against  the neighbors of the friends of the sisters-in-law   of   the&nbsp;piano teachers of the enemies  of the enemies that struck our homeland.&nbsp;     These last three-and-a-half years have brought some serious challenges to our nation,  like figuring out how to cow the average American into believing that we're interested in more than just lining our own pockets . We are meeting those challenges with strength and resolve. And today, the American people can be confident of a better future, a stronger economy, and a nation that is more secure  for the top 1% of the wealthy , because of the  lack of  character and the  laughable  leadership of George W. Bush.     John Kerry and his allies will spend over $500 million in negative  but true  advertising and get out the vote efforts this election year.&nbsp; The President and I need your help to counter their efforts  and keep their constituents from the polling places .&nbsp; Will you help us spread the President's positive message  of prosperity for the ultra-wealthy  and the truth about his record of accomplishment&nbsp;by making a contribution of $1000, $500, $250, $100 or even $50 today at   urlLink  www.GeorgeWBush.com/Cheney/   ?     President Bush has led this nation with strength and resolve  and a pathologically dogmatic adherence to misguided foreign policy &nbsp;as we confront the terrorist threat.&nbsp; In the war on terror, we will always seek cooperation from our allies around the world,  except for that one little time when we went to war against Iraq while telling the UN to kiss our butts .&nbsp; But as the President has made very clear:&nbsp; There is a difference between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few.&nbsp; The United States will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country,  nor will we require a hall pass to go to the potty.      These are not times for leaders who shift with the political winds&nbsp;-- saying one thing one day and another, the next.&nbsp; Even if it turns out their&nbsp;thoughts&nbsp;on one day were based on lies told by our&nbsp;President, and their thoughts the next were based on the uprooted facts. &nbsp;Senator Kerry's position on big issues often depends on when you ask him.   Like, before or after he knows the truth.    When Congress voted to authorize force against Saddam Hussein, Senator Kerry voted yes.&nbsp; This year, when it served his political purposes, he described himself as an opponent of the war.  Mostly because it turned out that there were no WMDs, and it was silly to be "against torture" when we were perpetrating it ourselves.      When it came time to fund our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, for body armor and other vital support, Kerry and Edwards both voted no, even though Senator Kerry said such a vote would be "irresponsible."&nbsp; Senator Kerry then explained that, "I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."  As opposed to Bush, who merely supports cutting back on insurance and housing expenses for the families of the troops .     We need a President who will  turn his  back  on  our troops 100 percent, and that's exactly the kind of President we have.     urlLink  www.GeorgeWBush.com/Cheney/      There is no doubt that great events will turn on this election.&nbsp; The leader who sits in the Oval Office will set the course of the war on terror, and set the direction of the American economy.&nbsp; Strong, consistent leadership is required.   That's why you should vote for Kerry.     Our economy has been tested these past three-and-a-half years, and we have responded with strong, decisive action  to make sure that none of our friends were affected .&nbsp; When we were elected to office, the economy was sliding toward recession,  in much the same&nbsp;way that the Titanic was sliding towards the bottom of the ocean the week before it sailed.  Then, on 9/11, terrorists struck our nation and shook our economy once again.&nbsp; We faced a basic decision -- to leave more money with families and businesses, or to take more of your tax dollars for the federal government  to, say, defend our land . President Bush made his choice.&nbsp; He proposed and delivered tax relief -- not once, not twice, but three times,  leaving you with an extra $300 that you probably spent in a week, and a $7.3 TRILLION debt that is increasing at an average rate of $1.69 BILLION/DAY. We think it was a good choice.      As a result, America has had the fastest growing economy in the world -  downwards .&nbsp; Individuals and families have received an average of $1,500 a year in tax relief.  For those of you bad at&nbsp;math (and since we've stunted our educational system, that's probably most of you) if you and all your neighbors got $300 a year, someone, probably a friend&nbsp;of Ken Lay, got a&nbsp;whole lot more. &nbsp;You're using that money far better than we would have in Washington,  like by buying lottery tickets, and all the duct tape and plastic sheeting you can use to defend yourself in case of another terrorist attack , and we did the right thing by returning it,  because all we'd have done is used it on better housing or medical plans for our soldiers who are fighting their hearts out in a war that shouldn't have been started in the first place.      Quality jobs have been created for 10 consecutive months, adding more than 1.5 million new jobs.&nbsp; National home ownership is at a record high.&nbsp;Productivity is high.&nbsp; The whole cabinet is high.  Incomes are rising.&nbsp; Inflation is low.&nbsp; Interest rates are low.&nbsp; And in the last year, our economy has grown at a rate of nearly 5 percent.&nbsp; The American people are proving the pessimists wrong, and the Bush tax cuts are working.&nbsp;  I'm particularly high.      urlLink  www.GeorgeWBush.com/Cheney/      We recognize there are still challenges, and we'll keep moving forward with a comprehensive pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda.     Our opponents have a different vision for the economy.&nbsp; They talk a lot about jobs, yet they never explain how they would put a single American back to work.&nbsp; Their big idea for the economy: raise our taxes.   Why do we need to pay down our debt? This is crazy economics!     In fact, they would repeal many of the Bush tax cuts within their first hundred days in office.&nbsp; This isn't surprising when you consider their record.&nbsp; Over the years, Senator Kerry has voted over 350 times for higher taxes on the American people.   Or, at least the American people who make over $250,000/yr.    On issue after issue, the choice on November 2nd will be clear.&nbsp; On national security, it's a choice between our President, a man of steadfast resolve,  bordering on pathological tunnel vision , and his opponent, who wavers with the political winds, like  other strong men who, when they learn they've been led down the wrong path, have changed their policies so as not to conflict with their own integrity .&nbsp; On the economy, it's a choice between our President, who has taken action and led America to days of progress and opportunity  to hold down 3 minimum wage jobs none of which provide insurance , and his opponent, who would take us backward  to a time when the economy was rosy, the government was flush, and fewer people were disconsolate about the job market .&nbsp; On the values of this great country,  where lying, blaming, torturing, and humiliating are held dear , it's a choice between our President, who has fought for and supported these values, and his opponent, rated as the most liberal member of the United States Senate.     On all these issues, we welcome the contest ahead, and we know, with your help,  and the help of the Diebold electronic voting machines , it is a contest we will win.     Sincerely,     &nbsp;   Dick  "Go Fuck Yourself"  Cheney

       For an apatheist*, cynic, critical thinker, realist, etc. I have a weirdly strong belief in the cosmic aether. Not the stuff that was widely thought to be the medium through which light and information traveled in space, but a metaphysical aether. The stuff that connects us all in the weird creepy way that makes you answer the phone, "Hi, mom... yeah, I just knew it was you..." or&nbsp;makes every obscure movie you reference obliquely show up on cinemax the next day.     &nbsp;   The aether has&nbsp;come up twice in conversation at my house in the past two days. Once in reference to the job market, and once while talking about how best to get through downtown without hitting any red lights.     &nbsp;   See, the way it works is this: You throw something like an intention, a job application, a personal ad&nbsp;into the aether. The intention/application/ad hits the aether and makes little aether ripples that slowly work their way through the universe, eventually sparking an event that ripples its way right back to you. It just does. It's magic.     &nbsp;   Here. Let me flesh this out a little more. [ed. note: people who use the expression "flush this out" need to think about what that really means. ok? ew.]     &nbsp;   Let's say you're looking for freelance work in, say, the field of marketing writing. So, you send out your cleverly made advertising postcards to 100 small companies for which you've uncovered the name of the appropriate person in the appropriate department and for whom you have a telephone number with which you can make a follow up call in a week. That's 100 little intention pebbles that you've just thrown into the aether!!! Of course none of those people are going to be interested in your work. So what!?!?&nbsp;You've got the ripples still working for you!     &nbsp;   Inevitably, after applying for 237 jobs, or sending out 100 marketing postcards, or putting up 3 personal ads, you have irritated the cosmos with so many ripples that it's going to spit something back out at you like some cosmic aether hairball. Poof. Some friend calls with a freelance gig totally unrelated to your mailing. Someone finds your resume online on a site you haven't updated in 4 years and they call with a great job opportunity. You meet someone in a museum who can quote the same movies as you and thinks your few extra pounds are damn sexy. Doesn't matter where you throw the pebbles, just freakin' throw 'em!     &nbsp;   The other aspect to the aether is that it has something of a schadenfreude-ish sense of humor. You know, you carry an umbrella every day in your car for&nbsp;a&nbsp;year, and the day you take it out, it pours and you're wearing a suede jacket and you're going for an interview. Lesson: always carry an umbrella. If you want to get through downtown without hitting any traffic lights, try to write something down on a small piece of paper that requires stopping for "just a sec'". Green for miles...     &nbsp;   The aether is&nbsp;feisty. I think that's why I believe in it...     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   *An apatheist is someone who really just can't be bothered with believing in a god... Yawn.

       Since when did   urlLink  acronyms    become things that you can't pronounce?   I always thought that the difference between an acronym and an initialization (or an initialism, as M-W calls it) was that acronyms are words like&nbsp;NASA and NATO, and not FBI, CIA, NSA, and IRS.     &nbsp;   Why does this annoy me? And, why could I only think of government agencies?     &nbsp;   And, just because word processors make allowances for kerning after a period, why is it so bad to put two spaces after one? I mean, I *like* the extra break. It tells me where I'm allowed to breathe a little more deeply, instead of just taking a short little gaspy thing at a comma. Is it because when I read, I hear it in my head? I hear the rhythm and the cadence, and I find that important? Or is it because I'm still mad that one horrible job at an ad agency beat the double-space out of me without my consent?     &nbsp;   It's sooooo hard to know.     &nbsp;   I'll talk another time about punctuation within quotes, and why American rules are stupid. But not now. I have work to do.

       An excerpt from a note I'd sent someone explaining how I got to Houston from NJ...       "  I'd been in Seattle - lovely lovely Seattle - when I made the mistake of getting married to and pregnant by a guy who was going to get his PhD faster than I was. Got dragged to Houston. Now I'm stuck here like the backs of your legs to a hot vinyl car seat..."

       I finally found a reality show I could really sink my teeth into.  urlLink Trading Spouses . On&nbsp;...&nbsp;go figure&nbsp;...&nbsp;Fox. The way it works is family number one yields up its wealthy, big-haired, two-steppin', white mom to swap parental control with the mom of family number two, a rural, lower middle class black family, whose dialogue, Fox apparently feels,&nbsp;requires subtitles. The prize? $50,000. The catch? The *other* mom gets to choose how it gets spent.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   I'm reluctant to get any further into it because it's nearly impossible to talk about the show without sounding racist. I'm open-minded and liberal and judge people usually by how they treat waitresses and by their bumperstickers, not by their color, sexual preference or religion. But, damn, there's only so PC you can be if you want to describe this show...     &nbsp;   Oh look. More guilt.      &nbsp;

       There should be&nbsp;something satisfying about getting up in time to relax over a cup of coffee and some breakfast before going in to work. And yet, somehow I'm not taking advantage of the satisfaction. Instead, I'm checking the time every few minutes thinking, "hey, I could get to work early for a change..."&nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;   But I know I'm not&nbsp;going to actually do that, so instead,&nbsp;  I'm here,&nbsp;spending 45 minutes feeling guilty about being unwilling to drive in a moment before I absolutely have to. In fact, I will probably put it off so long, get involved in some other morning activity, like depressing myself with the news, that I'll be a few minutes late. As usual.&nbsp;       This is the story of my life. Intentions and guilt.     &nbsp;   Presumably I'm not alone. I'm sure you understand...&nbsp; &nbsp;

       Went out training last night for the first time in a while. When I say "training" I don't mean it in the educational way. I mean actually fishing for trains. It's a weird practice that involves a lot of driving around through iffy neighborhoods, listening for whistles, trying to interpret track signals and carrying around spare change to mush on the tracks.  There are at least three things that I really like about going training. One is that I get to hang out with my buddy Kirk and hear him talk about the underside of Houston. I always imagine that taking the tour of the sewers in Paris is a lot like driving around Houston with Kirk. He knows little things. He knows the people who live in the weird houses and he knows that they have no showers and when it's nice they step outside to bathe with the garden hose. He knows where to look near the steel plant to find a bohemian urban gardens where moms bring their home-schooled children to help grow communal veggies. He's taught me that there's so much involved in the inner workings of a city that you can only see it if you peel up the veneer and crawl underneath. And it's not just the history of Houston that that I enjoy listening to or the tweaky little urban oddities that I enjoy finding. It's also the story of commerce that I've osmotically picked up. In some revelation of the obvious, I discovered that commerce drives the metabolism of our country. Trains are the blood vessels, industries are the major organs, and we're just little fat cells, getting bloated on the transported oil, chemicals, cars, and gravel. This isn't the kind of stuff I'd have ever learned in a classroom (even if I had given a crap about social studies 30 years ago...)      The second is the feel of power you get when you're standing 8 feet from a rushing locomotive. Not that *I* feel powerful, you understand. It's the feeling that power is around you. This huge unstoppable metal object hurling past you at 30 or 40 miles an hour (out of the city it's a lot faster) giving you a feeling of vertigo when you stand close. It's probably like the rush tornado chasers feel, only, let's face it... they're really wacko. Trains stay on tracks for the most part. Tornados are a little less committal about direction. The worst you can say about a train chaser is that they're eccentric...      The third thing is that I've developed a real fondness for industrial architecture, and you get a lot of that around train tracks. Dead old train yards. Steel mills. Chemical plants. Manufacturing buildings and warehouses. Recycling plants. Old buildings, reused and repurposed (a corporate term that I usually hate, but it fit the cadence...) Years of patina, piles of unrecognizable old parts, and dirt roads carrying dumptrucks and bobcats.        A lot of that is going away, though, and it makes me sad. The rush to the inner city has driven up the price of land in our area causing developers to tear down these fabulous old structures, scrape the land, and put up acres of townhomes that will soon be owned by people who are going to complain about the trains. Soon those iffy neighborhoods - those untouched ghettos where you find watermelon stands, chickens running wild and people still sitting out on their porches talking with their neighbors - soon they'll give way to urbanized, cookie cutter townhomes. Young, daring professionals on an adventure to the inner city will move in and the people who've lived there for years will be displaced.      We've already lost a metalworks company, where we could watch the graveyard shift lathe out a bunch of stainless widgets, leaving telltale shiny curls piled in the dumpster. We've lost the anonymous manufacturing company that never had more than 10 days in a row of accident free work according to the posted sign. We've already lost rows of historic rowhouses, covered over in kudzu and probably housing major rat populations.       I miss them already.  But, it's not going to stop me from enjoying the chase. I'll just have to keep my eyes out for little pockets of history, and I guess I'll just have to start carrying my camera with me.       Along with a lot of change to mush on the tracks...

       I got carded the other day.  >Beam  I'm actually not sure if the guy at Whole Foods was 100% serious, but he asked if I was old enough to be buying the wine in my basket. I looked at him, perplexed. I mean, I'll be 40 in a couple of months, and tho' I look young, it's been awhile since I looked *THAT* young.  Eventually, I just laughed, figuring he was just being funny and nice, but then he said somewhat earnestly, "Well, you fall into that group that is sort of on the line..."  Get. Out.  I took out my license for him. Eyebrow raised nearly above my hairline.  "Really, I just need to check."  "Hey, whatever. TOTALLY fine by me."  It's probably been about 4 or 5 years since I was carded with any real enthusiasm, and quite frankly, I'm not sure how I feel about it. Some of me is a little disappointed that I no longer fall into that "looks like late 20's but let's check just to make sure" range, but another part of me is thinkin', "Hey. I worked damn hard for the wisdom and experience that comes with these almost 40 years, I want them to be acknowledged, dammit!"  But, see, I dress casually, I don't wear makeup, my hair is minimally coiffed (by minimally, I mean, it's long and straight, and if I brush it after I shower, it means I'm going for an interview) and I really just look young. And, at the same time, I don't look old.  I know that sounds like the same thing, but it's not. There's a difference between looking young, and not looking old. See, I don't look like a young 40 year old. I just look like I couldn't possibly be 40.  You're probably thinking, "Shut up with all this complaining about looking young. It's worse than complaining about having a good paying job! Jeez!" But, as esoteric as it seems, it's an actual issue for me. By not looking my age, I don't get the same deference that other 40 year old, made up, highlighted hair, manicured nails, put together women get. Since I don't *act* like a 40 year old, I don't get treated like one. And, usually, that's ok. In fact, usually, that's great. I mean fantastic. Way way way cool. I like being one of the kids, one of the fray, one of the guys, one of the crowd.  But, sometimes it comes and bites me on the ass. I find that without the practice of acting like a 40 year old all the time, the people that I *DO* want to recognize my experience, and treat it with some respect, don't see it either, regardless of how much confidence I carry myself with. The guy at the car dealership (although that could be a "girl" thing), the salesman at the fancy watch store, my bosses... It's a peeve of mine, being treated like, -pat pat pat- aw, isn't she cute?      I know it'll happen when it comes time to buy another house, get another loan, deal with the title agency. They'll all be looking around for my father... Even my similarly aged relatives sometimes forget that I've aged along with them. Like I'm permanently 14, while they've managed to cleverly acquire the wisdom of age. It is so aggravating to be patronized. It makes me want to dye my hair grey and tattoo my birthdate to my forehead.       But, somehow it doesn't make me want to wear skirts and pumps all the time, cut my hair short and spend 45 minutes gelling and styling it in the morning and spending 15 minutes putting on make up.     So, I'm in a quandary. Which do I want more? Low maintenance, or respect?       Honestly? I guess it boils down to the fact that no matter how much it irritates me, if I can't get respect without trying to look my age, then I don't want it. It wouldn't be respect for what *I* offer. It would be respect for the image, and quite frankly, I don't think it deserves the exalted status it's already getting.       I guess I'm just going to continue to be culturally disobedient. Fits in nicely with the whole commune thing, anyway...

       There's something wrong here. There's all this talk about sustainability regarding our natural resources, the way we farm, the way we harvest energy, the way we fish, the way we treat our planet in general. But, I think we're missing something else. I don't think we're even living sustainably.      No, I don't physically exhaust myself each day by dragging a plow over 40 acres of land, or hunting for meat or gathering berries, or chewing hides into useable leather for clothes and shoes, or harvesting grain, or herding sheep... I sit on my ass all day in front of a computer. For 8 hours, plus or minus, I sit and I "develop information" for other people to use so that they can better sit on their asses for 8 hours, plus or minus, doing other things to perpetuate this whole ass-sitting thing.      It sort of sounds like we have it good compared to the hide-chewers, right?      But we don't. We sit in a tightly clustered group of people who are vying for raises, promotions, advancement, acknowledgement, praise, whatever. We sit with our backs open in a cube system, listening to every conversation everyone has with their father, sister, or gynecologist's receptionist. We stare at a screen that makes our eyes hurt and gives us headaches and bombards us with radiation that probably isn't so bad for us, but I still remember my mother saying, "DON'T SIT SO CLOSE TO THE TV!!", so I have questions. We are measured on a scale of productivity that is slippery to define and highly subjective at best. We are held to standards of personality that allow little room for creativity. Our privacy is non-existent and our anxiety is rising.      But, we make a lot of money, don't we?      Don't we?      Well, yeah, but I don't know about you, I have to spend it, too. Almost all of it. Sometimes more of it. I have to actually *buy* my food, and I can't chew hides into leather for shoes, although I can buy them cheaply at Target if things are tight. They're probably not as comfortable as the chewed ones, I'm guessing, but hey, they'll fall apart soon enough and I'll buy another pair. I have to buy my clothes and pay for electricity and water and gas, and pay to drive the miles to work because there's no way I could be lucky enough to live within walking distance of any place that would pay me well enough to afford a house. I have to pay my mortgage. I'm almost done paying for my education that I finished many years ago, whoo hoo. Partay.      I have to pay for my doctor, well, what's not covered by insurance which I also have to pay for. I have to go to the doctor a lot because, well, the job causes me stress and I have pains in my shoulders and elbows which may be related to sitting in front of a computer all day with my arms on my desk and my ass in a chair.       I'm not really putting any money away because I'm paying off debts that I incurred when I couldn't find a job for awhile, which caused me lots more stress and created tension for my family, making spending time with them additionally stressful. Even now that I have a job, and I'm paying off those debts, I still come home tired and don't have a lot of energy left with which to enjoy my family. And, it's not that I'm physically tired, I'm just drained from spending 8 hours in a row doing something only vaguely satisfying that has no direct benefit to my life.       I eat terribly and expensively because again I'm too tired to come home and cook a healthy meal. The ass that I sit on all day is increasing in size because prepared food is rarely balanced, healthy, or of normal proportions.       I have to pay to exercise.     Someone tell me why we do this again?  There are a lot of days that I'd rather be hitching up a plow harness around my shoulders or keeping a vegetable garden, some chickens and a goat, living among peach trees or apple trees or orange trees. There are a lot of days when I wish I had energy for more than just flipping through channels trying to find something less offensive than "Reality TV" on to bide my time until sleep. There are a lot of days that I'd rather be creating a future instead of saving for one.       I just don't feel like I'm living sustainably. Hell with the forests and the oil and the overfished rivers. I don't feel like I'm doing right by my own body.       I take vitamins because I eat fast food. I have to spend extra time in my day to exercise because I don't do anything more than move my fingers around at work. I breathe terrible air because I live in a city where you can't possibly walk or bike anywhere, and even if you did, no one else would, so you'd be biking through lousy air.       What the hell are we doing to ourselves?      And why?       What's with the push push push? Drive drive drive? Hurry hurry hurry? Why do we live to work instead of work to live? What's with the endless cycle of discontent? What's with "more than enough" being the new "enough"? Why aren't people like Ken Lay, Andrew Fastow and his wife, Bill Gates, and any other CEO making more than 40 times what their lowest paid employee makes satisfied?       What do I want? I want to be happy. I don't care about making a lot of money. I just want to do something that I'm passionate about. Something where at the end of the day I am exhausted but proud of my accomplishments. So I live in a smaller house or an apartment. So I don't eat out every night. So maybe I don't have every cable station known to man.       But, maybe I'm not so tired so I can hang out in the evening and do things like play music, or talk about politics, or read a book. Maybe I can even live so sparsely that I can take a little time to travel. Maybe I don't need to stay in a really nice hotel. Maybe the important thing is what you see and who you talk to and what you learn when you travel, and not the amount of silk stretched out in your accommodations.     Am I nuts? Sometimes I feel like an outcast. Even my own mother tells me that I can't give up my high paying job to take a lower paying job that may give me more life satisfaction because I'll soon discover that I'll "Need The Money More Than I Think." But, really, all I end up with when I actually have all that extra money is stuff that collects dust and a sleep deprivation problem.  (Don't get me wrong. At the moment this is purely theoretical because I have a gazillion dollars in credit card debt from being unemployed for much longer than I wanted to be, and I can't possibly give up my high paying job unless I win the lottery or you all get together and send money to my paypal account, which I'll let you if you really want to.)  Anyway, EVEN at a theoretical level, I can't get many people to even understand what I mean.  Doesn't anyone else have this fantasy? The one about finding a piece of land not too far from a town with a few reasonable jobs. The one where you grow your own veggies and fruit, and you raise a few chickens for eggs and the occasional beheading. The one where you have few sheep to sell their wool and maybe a goat or two named Chloe and Daphne for some specialty hand-crafted chevre. (Ok, that's not my fantasy, that's a friend of mine's. I borrowed it for literary purposes.) The one where you share the land with a few other like-minded friends who grow different things and raise different animals and have different specialties. Friends who've learned how to blacksmith, or can build furniture, or make beer, or stitch up a nasty cut. The one where you live and share your goodies and good conversation together.   The one where you get to keep your cell phone, broadband access and maybe even netflix.       So I'm a little spoiled.  I don't know. Maybe it's just me. Maybe it's totally ridiculous. But I still think that a subsistence commune with a few good friends would make getting up in the morning a whole lot easier than getting up to go sit on my ass with my back exposed and worrying about the price of stock.       It's just not sustainable...

       It turns out that the other week was the week the calves were taken away from the cows, and the relentless mooing that kept me awake was just part of "how they get" at that time of the year...     Hormones. I totally get it.

       Ok, so what's the deal with the Dick York/Dick Sargeant thing? I mean, say you're nine or ten, and you come home after school to watch the season premiere of Bewitched, and you find Samantha sleeping with another man, AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT'S NOT THE SAME GUY!! It's like the Sixth Sense or something!  I'm going to take a moment to wallow in my victimhood, and decide to blame my whole misguided adulthood on the fact that my moral compass hit a magnetic anomaly when I watched a near family member trade her husband in for a better looking one.  Larry, fix me a martini.

       I am shockingly not creative when I have PMS. Oh, yeah, I come up with curse words I've never used before, sure, but when it comes to having something clever to say, nope. Not there.      Plus, I'm cranky. Mostly I feel like curling up in a little ball and sleeping for 4 days. Don't get me wrong, I did quite a bit of that this weekend, but I just don't feel like I'm done yet.       I'm at my most fetal, most infantile, most needing to be wrapped up in a blanket and rocked to sleep when I have PMS. If you've never had it, you can't understand it. You know how when someone cuts you off on the highway, and you have to slam on the brakes and hit the horn and your adrenalin squirts into your bloodstream and you get red in the face and you use words you usually only hear on the Sopranos, or, similarly, on NJ freeways? Well, that's sort of what PMS is like -- except there's no guy cutting you off. Emotion without context. Mm mm good.      In fact, you could be making eggs and you're swamped with this, this, this, bbblllluah, nameless emotion, and you want to cry and yell and stir all at the same time. See, when someone cuts you off, you understand completely why you're pissed. Your passengers don't even mind if you take it out on them for a few seconds afterwards because they understand that you've just got some leftover anger that you've got to vent, and that's cool. Hell, sometimes they're angry too. Bastard didn't use his signal! Fucker. But when you're making eggs, and you suddenly feel the need to put your fist through a wall, and you vent at the guy grinding coffee beans next to you, he's more than likely to be a little confused.       Worse, you're more than likely a little confused. You know you're upset, and usually when you're upset there's a reason, so presumably there's a reason this time, too. But, where is it? You swish the eggs around a little, looking to see if the reason is in there, but it's not. So, you start looking elsewhere. Surely you can't be feeling these emotions for no reason. Dammit. Who has pissed you off? Hey, that guy next to you grinding coffee beans might have done something. Maybe you don't know precisely what, but if you think about it carefully, you can probably put together a few microscopic incidents that, TOGETHER, make a real good reason for your adrenalin to be pumping. Hey, didn't he roll the other way when you tried to kiss him good morning? And... yeah... didn't he not want to watch the movie you wanted to watch last night? He hates you. He wants nothing to do with you anymore, and THAT'S why you're pissed off.       Phew. At least you figured it out. Now you can feel good and justified being pissed at him. All day. Kick him if you need to. He deserved it. He didn't hug you when you clearly needed to be hugged. It was all over your face. Damn him for not reading your mind. Fucker.      Unfortunately for our barista, he has no clue what the fuck is going on. The more perplexed he is, the more distant he gets. After all, he's now dealing with a crazy person. The more distant he gets, the deeper the hole gets, 'cos the more of that information spackle you use to explain the increasingly cranky mood you're in.      Do you know about information spackle? When you've got gaps in your data, and you're trying to reach a conclusion, you start filling them in with information spackle. It's made by DuPont, I think. Whatever it is, it's not the kind of stuff that occurs in nature. Manufactured polymer information spackle.       Hormones suck. Yeah yeah, I know there are people out there who don't believe in PMS. That it's just an excuse women use to be bitchy on a monthly basis. Some women don't like it because it gets used against them in a dismissive way, like, "Oh, don't worry about her, she's just got PMS, now about that executive decision..." But for me, I know. *I* get PMS, and I get it bad, and I'm a raving lunatic when I do. I should be locked up and not allowed to interact with other humans.       Particularly the guy who makes my coffee in the morning... I'm sorry, babe...

       My cousin Stuart and I have an ongoing discussion about God and his existence. (Gimme a break. I'm just picking a pronoun. I don't believe anyway, so why not make God a man?)       Today, I wrote to him the following:     ...yeah, but *I* don't think I'm fucked. See, my expectations are kinda low. You go in the ground. The worms eat you. If you're lucky, your children/students/people you've met take what you taught them and keep you around for a little while in today's equivalent of legend. If not, not. Eat the good food while you can. Have great sex. Meet as many interesting people as possible. Make as many people laugh as you can. Drive fast when you can get away with it, and accept your speeding tickets like an adult (got one 2 days ago... I didn't argue. I was speeding. Sure, I'll pay a lawyer to fight it in court, but I treated the cop far better than he treated me...)  Then again, if there *were* a God, I think he'd be wise enough to realize that one of the blessings (and I don't use that word very often) that he gave to his children was the ability to make their own decisions, and to feel confident in their own beliefs. Whatever makes them happy and good. What's it to him if we believe in his omnipotence? Does he need some sort of validation? Bah. Maybe I don't believe in God as he's described in current judeo-christian religions because he's the only one doling out treats and punishments, and requires us to behave well NOT because it's the right thing to do, but rather because we'll be rewarded in the end. Sounds like encouraging greed to me, and it doesn't sound like the kind of God I'd want to believe in. Plus, it makes the believers (and I'm thinking of Bush right now) forget that most of our treats and punishments come directly from the people we interact with daily. God does NOT bless America. God does NOT recognize political boundaries. It's probably THE MOST repugnant bumpersticker I see on a daily basis. It's up to US to make America worthy of friendship from other countries. And, we're doing a pretty shitty job. I would think that in this case God would go out of his way to throw down a few plagues. We're worse that the freakin' Egyptians.  So, I'll rephrase my belief like this: maybe there is a God, but if there is, it's my belief that he's hoping that we grow up to the point where we don't need him to supervise us or ask to use the car or tell us to take out the trash. He's waiting to spend his days playing golf and feeling content knowing we can act like mensches without bugging him all the time. Trusting that we have learned that if we do good, good comes back around. Eventually.  I'm leaving the guy alone. He needs a break from babysitting...    I was happy to note that it's sort of consistent with the aether thing. God really just takes too much personal responsibility out of the picture. I still dig the aether. And, if you recall, by design, it has a global snarky sense of humor. Way cool.

       It's my kid's birthday today. He's 14. Which means he left to live with his dad just in time for him to learn how to drive, go through wicked puberty, and discover that adults are stupid. (Actually, he's known the latter for a fairly long time...) I'll take him back when his insurance rates drop, he's got a girlfriend, and has discovered that adults actually know a thing or two...      Love you kiddo!!! Miss you a lot!      -mom

       "Moo" is a totally inadequate transliteration of cow talk. I know this. I spent all night at the Country House (capitalized so you know to pronounce it with a upper-crust, lock-jaw accent) listening to complex cow conversation.  In fact, most cows sound startlingly like deaf-mute prison inmates complaining about their accommodations.  Really loudly.  I got up and went out back stark naked, 'cos, a) that's how I sleep, and b) you can do that at the Country House without much risk of anything but a cow, horse or goat seeing you. I was looking for the cows, wanting to tell one or two to shut the fuck up and let me go back to sleep, but there weren't any back there. That made me a little nervous. They'd been mooing from the back of the house, dammit, they should *BE* in the back of the house. Was there someone in the woods, perhaps an escaped deaf-mute prison inmate, say, complaining about his accommodations? I didn't know. I was extremely naked, sadly lacking in cow targets for verbal abuse, and now on the lookout for a moving orange jumpsuit.  I wandered around the deck to the side of the house. This felt a little sketchier. I mean, there was still very little chance of anything but the above mentioned fauna to catch a glimpse of all the extra bits of me that have been accumulating over the last couple of decades, but I had less protection from the house. Now I was visible from the road...      Ok, dirt road. Driveway, really. Whatever.  It's moo(oooo)t anyway. All that was out front were a bunch of cows. And as I made myself known, they all turned and stared. If you've never been stared at by a bunch of cows, you can't possibly know what that feels like. The first thing that happens is you look behind you to see if someone with a barbeque pit is warming up the mesquite. Second, after you realize that they're actually staring at YOU, you anthropomorphize their thoughts. "What the hell is that?" "I don't know, I've never seen anything like it before!" "Ew. Needs fur." I took a moment to reflect on the diversity of nature, then yelled "SHUT THE FUCK UP!" to the white cow standing closest to me. It looked me up and down, turned, and bolted across the creek.      Ooh. Ego crushing. I need to start working out again.      I did my best to shoo them away, but those cows are damn stubborn. They stood, steadfastly mooing, complaining about their accommodations, and questioning my presence.       I left them to their complex conversation and went back to bed.
