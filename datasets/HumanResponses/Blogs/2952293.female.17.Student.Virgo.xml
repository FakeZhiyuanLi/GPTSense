      HI! I didn't blog yesterday, cause I had SAT class and a Chem test the next day. Funny stuff happened, though. Of course, now I don't remember it. Well I thought I was really funny in all my classes, but nobody laughed but me. In English, Dr. Doden said, "Everybody looks like somebody else." And I said, "Yeah, I get J. Lo ALL the time!" And in History, we were talking about WWII and the neutral countries, etc. So I asked, "If you want to be neutral, do you just call up Germany and say, 'Hey Hitler, me and my country are neutral, okay?'" Then people were like, "This is Germany, leave a message at the beep. BEEP: 'Hey Adolf! Hey we're gonna sit this one out, k? Good luck with that war thing!'". Well I'm not sure if people said that, but that's silly and I like it. Study hall was great! Erica asked Talia if it was true that Orthodox Jews can't waste semen. Talia tried to explain it to us that they can't release semen in vain, but of course I had to ask, "Does that mean you have to swallow?" AHH ALLISON YOU ARE SO GROSS! Then I was attacked in the student council meeting. ATTACKED. How come every time a teacher makes fun of me and makes me embarrassed, Ann Kelley is sitting there laughing? EVERY TIME! It's crazy. So Zazu (if you go to CSG and don't know who that is, you really should not ask me cause I'll punch you in the gut, just like Miriam did to Erica in fifth grade!) tells us that elections (ahh the acid in my stomach is churning up, cause I am soo nervous) are going to be like this: speeches on Monday, voting on Tuesday, and finding out on Wednesday. First off, that's just fucked up. I'm sorry, but it just is. It's so stupid, I can't even tell you. So she asked for our opinions on how the voting should go on Tuesday and different things, but she didn't ask us if we liked that idea at all! She just said that the faculty liked it and we were going to try it, next year they could adjust it if this doesn't work. BULLSHIT! I am NOT going to be your damn guinea pig, NO. So I raise my hand, and take a risk to share my thoughts, and say, "As someone who has sat in that chair, and knows how it feels to take a risk like that, it is really nerve-racking. And the last thing you want to do is have to wait three days to find out the results! And I don't know about you, but when I'm really nervous I can't focus on everything else I have to do." Well, you know what, that yatch bastard beeyatch turned it against me. "Well Allison, you're so tense... we have to break you of these habits. In the real world (PS THIS IS HIGH SCHOOL, SCREW THE REAL WORLD RIGHT NOW) you will have to wait. If you apply for a job, you have to wait to find out what will happen." And I said, "Well, at least then the whole high school isn't watching!" Then after the meeting, she came up to me and told me I was so stressed out and she was going to change me and make it better. F YOU BITCH. I am so angry with this, so I'm just going to vent. Let me tell you something, boob job woman, I am nervous and stressed, but that's MY business. And this is a student council meeting; this has nothing to do with Allison Ansari AT ALL. Don't address me and my issues in front of the rest of the council, that's not their business or their cares. You asked for an opinion and I gave you one, and then you attack me. I don't cry and let emotion take over me in front of other people, but I was shaking so hard fighting back the tears, that I almost had to leave. When I told my mom about it that night, I completely broke down. If she even approaches me, I will tell her straight out that she WILL NOT disrespect me again like that, she was completely out of line. I do not fear her, she looks like a bird.  Thankfully, I laughed a lot at SAT class. It's my favorite thing right now, everybody should go out and take it. Our teacher is so dorky!!! AHH we had to do this survey of the program, and for "Additional teacher comments", Chelsea put, "He cool!" LOVE HER. But she distracts me, and I don't pay attention. Then the Indian girl was sitting with this white boy, and Chels and I think they like each other. But the brainy girl is trying to break it up. It's so good to watch the relationship unfold. Chelsea and I were the only ones to get vocab words wrong in the challenge between "This side of the room" and "This side of the room". You know how when you break up into two teams, one might be A and the other might be B. Well our teacher wrote on the board, "This side of the room" and "This side of the room" HE'S A FOOL. The girl behind me didn't know some of the words, so I'd try and shake my head yes or no, but the teacher said, "I see you shaking your head." And I said, "NO, I just got the shakes!" I laughed. A lot of funny stuff happened, but I can't remember.  Today was okay. Nothing was really outstandingly funny. I had a Chem test, but it was easy and I did well and that was exciting. We watched this documentary on this Spanish writer, who we are reading, and she was talking about one of her characters and she said, "He is an Arabian man with a hair lip, I've never met anyone like him." I thought it was really funny, but then I didn't know what a hair lip was, so in reality it's not funny. Alas, I laughed. I had to do flags at chapel, which blew. Lauren Smiley hit something on her way in, I laughed. Then Sally Kurgis read the wrong part of the responsive reading, and everybody laughed. AP Spanish actually was funny. All we did was talk about prom. Erica came in and embarrassed Senor, it was fantastic. Usually at tutoring the kids don't talk to me, but when I walked in one called my name out and we worked together. We did these really challenging math games, and I felt very foolish. Then Libby told me that the Chair Nazi has a (gasp) BOYFRIEND. She recently got divorced, but apparently she's back on the scene. That just bursts any confidence I've ever had, there it goes, wave goodbye.  I thought I was really funny in Elizabeth's car. We were talking about Fall Out Boy, and I said, "They're going to be really big, right after I touch them!!!" It was so gross, but I laughed so hard, cause I think I have to be funny since I descend from the family of Carrot Top, therefore I must be super funny! So, there it is. Oh and then I went to the grocery store, and people were staring at me, because of my uniform. When I was walking out two guys were sitting on a bench, and one hits the other guy and then points at me, LIKE I DON'T SEE YOU A HOLE. WORK IT OUT. Bye.

      HELLO and spring break is OVER! I know, it is very sad. But it was really good to see everybody again. Today was really funny and I just can't even recapture all of its glory. Before school had even started, I swore more than I had the entire two weeks off. F this and F that. In announcements we learned that Senor had done something good, well I didn't even pay attention. All the seniors got into really good schools, which causes me much distress. English was just English with Dr. Doden. We talked about Beloved, which I haven't even finished. I think it was funny, but I can't really remember. Nobody can retain information first period; it's just a fact. But math class........ oh Ms. Potts why do you hate me so??? First off, I sit at the far right side of the classroom, so when she writes on the far left board, with a black pen, in tiny writing, with a glare, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE! So, I was squinting, and she is like "Where are your glasses, Allison?" And I said I didn't wear glasses, and she told me I needed to get some. Then she draws this graph on the board and asks what it is. People shouted out really stupid stuff that was wrong. She then told us that it was half of an ellipse, people started laughing, cause nobody was close to that answer, and Ms. Potts said, "What did you do now Allison?" I WAS SILENT THE ENTIRE TIME. Ann and Anna were laughing really hard. Anna was red, because last night we talked about how much Ms. Potts doesn't like me, and then today was so bad. It was great. Third period History is just classic. I got a gold star, but I should have gotten two, but I won't let it get to me. Actually, everybody was really smart today and I was proud. Then Mr. O'Grady was telling us about this Japanese military general and his name was Toejam. WHAT?! It was Tojo, but Mr. O said Toejam!!! So I said, "Is that T-O-E-J-O-E?" OOH we were laughing. He kept instructing us about different Generals and Admirals in WWII, and I kept shouting out Custard, which is completely wrong on so many levels. Then Katie was like, "I'm really hungry. I like custard in a creme bur le (I don't speak French, I don't know how to spell that)" and I said, "Or a bear claw!!!" We talk about doughnuts a lot in that class. Chem was just Doc being crazy. OOH wait, in History, Chelsea was like "Doc lost his solar powered calculater, and now he has to use a TI-83, he's freaking out!" See, Doc has this obnoxious solar-powered calculator, which he has to throw against a desk to turn on. All of a sudden, in the middle of a test, he'll throw it across the room. DOC YOU ARE CRAZY. We weren't really doing anything, but Sam kept asking test questions, of course only she listens and pays attention. I didn't know what I was talking about in Spanish, as always. I speak crazy. Lunch was hot dogs, so Erica and I were really excited. I had kickboxing today, it was intense as always. Margaret and I got in a huge debate about  The Feminine Mystique   and the ideas about the role of women in society. I'm sorry, Margaret, but if I am unfortunate enough to get knocked up and have those brats, I will still work. They can go to daycare for all I care. I'm not giving up my life for them. Oh, by the way, Bush is going to try and ban partial-birth abortions, even if it will endanger the mother's life. So basically, ladies, you have absolutely NO SAY about your own bodies. You can get raped, and the government is going to think it's your own fault. So you must have your buck-toothed rapers baby and you had better change your entire life to become some poor mom. Have fun with that. Elizabeth Chinn and I talked about how stupid all this stuff is. She said they might have monitors, who will come stay with you and make sure you have that damn baby. If you don't want it, you shouldn't have to have it. It's your body, that's it. I don't care what anybody thinks; it's MY CHOICE SO SUCK IT. Anyways, I am scared of how Margaret will react, but alas I must speak my peace. Now I am home... but I do have some funny stories about my Grandmother: 1. There is this area by her house that has really developed. I asked if it had always been this busy in my lifetime, or if it was just land when I was a baby. My grandma said, "Yeah it used to just be land. They said it always would be. (In a sarcastic tone) That was a farce." AHH Grandma! 2. We were watching Dateline, and this guy was trying to lose weight. He had this really bad beard. There was a tuft on one side of his cheek and another tuft on the other part of the cheek. But there was skin in between, I asked my grandma what was up with that and she said, "Well, that's his own fault!" AHH I LAUGHED! 3. Now she puts black stuff in her eyebrows and my mom questioned it and she was like "I need help!"  LOVE THAT! Well I must do homework. BYE!

      I wanted to share this very weird thing that happened, which I forgot to mention earlier. You know how when you are landing on a plane, you are supposed to turn off CD players and other electronics? Well, I don't do that. When we were right about to land in Chicago, I was listening to Fall Out Boy. The fifth song came on, which doesn't seem like a big deal, however the first lyrics are: "Landing on a runway in Chicago". Isn't that strange!

      I LOVE SAT CLASS. It is just sooo funny! It's kind of sad though, because I did the first part in the summer, so I'm just joining in the rest and the class has jokes I don't get. Plus I missed two sessions and I'm missing two more. So I am kind of out of the loop. Anyways, our teacher is nerdy and it's really funny. There is this OBNOXIOUS girl who tries to get everything right- AHHHH SHE'S A FOOL! Well, we always get in little groups and work on assignments. I got grouped with these two other Indian kids. Somehow we ended up talking about our Indian-ness AND IT WAS FANTASTIC. I never find people who are like me, except the three original Indians running around the school, oh yeah and my favorite MEGAN KAMATH!!!!!!!!!!!!! But, other than that, I know no Indians. Well, actually, I'm only half Indian, and I'm Muslim, so basically I'm just terrorist, IT'S FINE. But it was really funny. And the smart girl kept yelling at us, since we didn't do our work. BOO HOO WHITE GIRL. I am kidding! It was good times.  I haven't posted for a while, because I was college visiting. What an experience that was. I left last Tuesday and my mom was already annoying me. It was really crazy, because I told my mom that I really wanted to see somebody famous, and at our layover in Chicago, my mom came back to where we were sitting and said she saw somebody famous!!! She was like "Go over to that kid and ask him if he was in  Mystic River . Then get me an autograph!" So we bet a dollar that I would, and of course, for money, I'd do anything! I walked over to him, and I was standing by his side, and he was looking the other way. So I said "Hi." It was funny. He turned around and I asked, "Were you in  Mystic River ?" He said yes, and I got all giddy like a school girl. I went on talking, "My mom noticed you. Can she have your autograph??" Then I handed him my Northeastern college brochure and a pen and told him her name and he started to write the autograph. I think somewhere in that time I said, "I feel like a groupie." Now Allison, do you know what a groupie is??? You were asking for an autograph, you didn't pull his pants down or anything. I am just that lame. I asked what other movies he'd been in and he said movies like:  Gladiator ,  Double Jeopardy , and  Unbreakable . He was the little son in  Unbreakable  who tried to kill himself. That was a really powerful role. Anyways I started sputtering random things for a little bit, and he stuck out his hand and introduced himself as Spencer, and I said my name was Allison and we shook on it. Then I was like, "I want a picture, can you wait here while I get my camera?" And he goes, "Why don't I go with you, we can meet your mom." WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO MEET MY MOM- SHE'S CRAZY!!! So we walk over to my mom and she gets all excited and rambling on about his movies and she asked him why he was going to Connecticut. He said that's where he was from and my mom was like, "Well we are college visiting." And he asked me if I was a junior and he said he was too. Then it was over. We got on the plane. I sat in the row in front of him, next to an annoying beeyatch. Nice times, nice times.  We stayed with my dad to save a bit of cash. We drove to Boston the next morning to visit BU and Northeastern. I didn't like either. There was a blizzard in Boston. A BLIZZARD! The schools were bad. The funniest stuff happened while we were driving to Northeastern. My mom was trying to read the directions, but she was being stupid. I had visited the campus over Winter Break with my dad, and I knew where the admissions office was. The map directions were incorrect, but I kept insisting that I knew where it was. My dad said, "Oh right, we visited it, we know where it is. We just have to drive into the campus." And I was like yes that's correct, being that I just said that. But then he goes, "Well I don't know where that is. I don't know what to do." and my mom is freaking out, "These directions, I just don't know!" And I keep telling them that I know where to go, I said, "Dad, remember we visited it. I know where it is, just drive into the campus on this road." And he says, "Oh yeah I remember, we just go in here. It's fine, we know what we're doing." Five minutes later... "Where are we? What are we doing? I don't know what I am doing!!" I WANTED TO SHOOT THEM BOTH! Then my mom tells me that my father, MY FATHER- THE CRAZY INDIAN MAN WHO IS EVIL AND SHOULD DIE AND AFTER 17 YEARS I'VE FIGURED OUT THAT HE'S JUST CRAZY, is taking dance lessons. He's trying to be a "Renaissance man" as my mom says. I couldn't believe it. Dance, my dad, that's just sick and wrong. That night he taught me the Rumba, Cha Cha, Tango, Waltz, Fox Trot, and East Coast Swing. I just can't believe it, my dad and dancing, that's messed up.  Thursday we left for NYC. I love the city, just love it. We looked at Barnard, even with an open mind, it sucked. We walked around Columbia, it was gorgeous. I doubt I could get in there. I saw a yearbook of theirs, and Brooke Smith was in it. Hope she's doing well. We walked around Time Square, where I ran into Aileen. AHH THE UNIES WILL ALWAYS SMELL EACH OTHER OUT. I was walking by the MTV studio, and it was TRL time, and there were so many kids there. Then the camera panned down towards the crowd and they started screaming, and I waved. Who knows, I may have been on TRL. That night my mom and I watched "The Apprentice" in NYC! We were so close to the Donald himself. Love you Trumpy. The next day we skipped Fordham, come on, the Bronx, I don't think so. Later we went to NYU. I LOVE IT. I WANT TO GO THERE. NOBODY APPLY OR I WILL SLIT YOU. I had my information session with none other than... MEGAN KAMATH. I sing a song about her. Love that kid. That night we went to a movie, and when I walked out of the theater, instead of security guards at Easton, I saw the freaking Empire State Building. It was really strange. We left at like 8 the next morning to go to DC. That train ride was crazy. We went through Jersey, Philly, Maryland, Delaware, and plus on the trip we'd hit down in Chicago, Hartford, Boston, NYC, and then DC. I feel like I've been across this entire nation. It was really warm in Washington and nice. The magnolia trees were gorgeous. Our hotel was kick ass. We got robes and mints at night. It was the shit. We didn't do any school visiting on Saturday or Sunday. We just walked the Mall and stuff. We went to the Holocaust museum, since we DIDN'T do it in eighth grade. It was sad though. Monday was GWU time (George Washington University). I liked it there too. I ate lunch with a senior there. He was a really hot Indian guy. It was sweet. Then we headed home. We got home at like midnight, only to find out that my godmother had died that morning. It's really sad. She was my mom's best friend and they grew up together. So I'm leaving for Cleveland tomorrow for the funeral. These two weeks have really been emotionally and physically draining.  I went to lunch with Meghan yesterday. We had some goood times. And today is Anna's birthday, so I might go see her. Well this has been a looooooooong entry, and I'm tired and sweating from it. I must go, goodbye!!! PS I got my comments and they weren't as bad as I thought. But Senora was like "OOH the aJorge likes her acats!" AHH YES I DO LIKE MY CATS.   BYE!

       NOTE TO READERS: THIS POST IS IN ADDITION TO MY LAST. READ THE ONE BEFORE THIS BEFORE YOU READ THIS ONE. THANKS.  Hey hey! I forgot to add some stuff about last night. Ace was wearing an Epcot hoodie, and I love Epcot, it's my favorite Kingdom. It was also really funny when the first band was talking. One guy goes, "you can e-mail us and talk about barriers" (they kept mentioning how far away the stage was from the barrier to hold the crowd back) and the other guy goes, "or terriers. BEST IN SHOW!" AHH I thought it was so funny I laughed for like five minutes. But the funniest part was... I think I mentioned that we sat next to this guy and he is new in town and has no friends. He also wore a ring EXACTLY like the Lord of the Rings one. He was obsessed with the band Silverchair. Remember that song "Ana's Song" about anorexia and everything. I go, "Wasn't the lead singer anorexic?" And he told me that his girlfriend influenced him or something and then he became worried about his weight and I go, "what a bitch!" And then he tells us that she is his friend. AHHH! Somehow later on we said something and he was like, "I was anorexic for awhile" Man we messed up with that kid. He kept talking to this kid in the pit at breaks. This kid was really funny. He hates rock videos with "scantily clad" women. He said he likes women, but not in videos like the Perfect Circle's new one. I don't know, he was crazy. So I asked if he liked Britney Spears, and he said no, and then the kid next to us was like "I don't like her, she's too chubby!" WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! Oh but he likes Paris Hilton, no Nicky Hilton- WHATEVER THE HILTON'S SHOULD DIE! Then the kid in the pit tells me my earrings were really long. Who notices that stuff??? When the guy next to us went somewhere for a minute, we moved down seats. The kid in the pit looked at me and then looked around for him. Then when he came back and sat down at the furthest seat, the two guys looked at each other, and I looked back and forth between the two, dude some definite sexual tension was there. IT WAS AWESOME!

      One word: minivan. One word: evil. Yes, I'd like to just preach the fact that I hate all minivans, and they should be knocked off the road. They just don't know how to drive. That's a fact.  Well lots of stuff has happened. Yesterday I went to babysit. Veda is gone for a few weeks, so this lady, Rita, was helping out. I'd heard her on the phone, and thought she was Jamacian, but found out that she is Indian. Anyways, we somehow end up talking about her eighth grade daughter and how messed up she is. She wanted to start shaving her armpits, and eventually worked her way down to an area I'm not going to name. Now Rita, I just met you, why the hell are you telling me this?! Then she asked me my grades, and my math grade, I mean why doesn't she just transform into my father and kill me. Then I went shopping for my college visits. Note to self: never go spend $300 running on two poptarts and some milk. You must stay hydrated, it's key to a successful shopping experience. I thought I was going to die afterwards, so I went home and then to a movie. I saw Secret Window, it was good. Go see it. Johnny Depp, 'nough said.  Today was CRAZY! I went to see the Early November show. I met Elizabeth there at 1:30, I know, the show was at 7. We walked around a lot and experienced campus life. OSU- not for me. We headed behind the theater at about 3. We met Joe, Sergio, and the oh-so-beautiful ACE, back there. They were really nice. All except Jeff, who despite my constant badgering, had no interest. Bastard. Then we headed towards the line. I'd seen two girls there earlier, but now they were gone. WE WERE FIRST IN LINE. For some reason, it felt like a really big deal. All of a sudden these other two girls come up to us. For one, as bad as it is, all I could think was "moley moley moley". They stared at us for literally several minutes. I finally was just like "what?!" They told us that they were asked to put up fliers and they wanted their spots back. I was all no way Jose, but the staring and glaring would not end, so I was like "fine take the damn spots, JUST TAKE THEM!" It was awkward the rest of the four hour wait. Some good stuff happened though. The first two girls I saw came back, and we ended up talking a lot. We were really similar, and it was fun to share different concert stories. All of a sudden these college guys come up and ask us if we wanted to be in a video survey. We said okay, and then they began to ask us healthcare questions and so on. Then he goes, "So if you messed up your arm, and the doctors could amputate it for $70,000 with three days in the hospital, would you take that or try a $70 maggot treatment?" WHAT?!?!?!?! They kept asking us what maggots looked like and every other question you could ask about a maggot. Then they had one of the guys kneel on the ground, and they go, "Pretend he's a maggot, what would you do to get him to go away?" Elizabeth and this other girl poked him, but I swatted him and shouted "shoo get away!" AHHHH MAGGOTS! Ace came around again, and I got a picture with him. It was really hot. He put his arm around me, and afterwards instead of just pulling it away, he dragged his hand across my back towards him. I am drooling at the thought of his beautiful face. He cut his hair, I like it a lot more. The first band Limerick or some shit was a little folky, but still good. I really liked Spitalfield. First off, that name is kickin. One guy, TJ or DJ or something, was ADORABLE. I fell in love with him. He was hot. Hey Mercedes was obnoxious. Early November was VERY VERY VERY GOOD! I like them a lot. I want to have Ace's baby, without having a baby. For their encore they played, "I want to hear you sad" I LOVE THAT SONG! I screamed really loud. It made me think of Yellowcard at Warped Tour and how loud I screamed for "October Nights". Good times all around.  Now I am very tired and my ears are ringing. I won't post for awhile, since I'm headed towards Boston, NYC, and DC for college visiting. Wish me luck.... byeeee! PS I miss my Unies, I hope you guys are having a good spring break!

      HIIIIIII. It's been awhile. I'm running on like five hours of sleep and it is REALLY getting to me. Yesterday was Senior Day, and I have to hand it to them, they did a really good job. It got boring at times, but they really pulled off one of the better senior days in a long time. The skit CRACKED ME UP! My favorite part was Beth playing Mr. Tappan and the whole "Snow white huskey here". OOOH TAPPAN ARE THERE REALLY SUCH THINGS AS RED HUSKIES?! Actually yes, I met Sammy's, and they were quite beautiful. Then the Moose was funny "SHAAARON"- dude I really hate Salzar. The rest of the day was good. Erica said something funny that I was going to put into my blog, but now I can't remember it. The pie toss was good. Senor was a woman and ducked his pie, I later asked him why he couldn't handle it like a real men, and he glared as if to tell me I'd be receiving an effort two. ps your kids are ugly and albino. pps I'm mean.  Nikki was drooling over him, and I go, "Nikki, you think Senor's hot, you think Hartshorne's hot, and you think Tappan's hot!" And Nikki said, "He looks good in navy!" IT WAS PRICELESS. I didn't like the finale. We pay 15 grand a year to avoid boys. So when I walk into a gym that reeks of male- I get pissed. AHAHAHA I KEED... or do I??? Do you guys remember Triumph the Insult Dog?? "I KEED I KEED!"  That night was busy consisting of hell (aka Easton), some bball, and a little Chelsea Rauck. I spent the night at Chelsea's, and it was really fun. We laughed, a lot. In the middle of the night I woke up and Chelsea was holding the alarm clock in her arms, what was up with that? The next morning we had SAT class. It wasn't as funny as it was in the summer, but it was good. We took the test today and it was really hard. This brown kid came in late and he asked for a pencil and then asked for a calculater-get it together! Each person asked what the date was, nobody knew, I chuckled.  I went to see Big Fish tonight. Libby came with me. It was funny. This women was being so obnoxious. In the part where the boy goes to see thes scary old woman, this black cat runs across the screen and she says, "Ahh a black cat!" Okay, we got then when the cat literally ran across the screen and the whole theater sounded like a giant hiss, I got it. Then we went to Max and Ermas (my second visit there this weekend). It was good. It was funny. This guy was eating with a girl, and she left for a minute when the food came. He didn't even sneak a piece of broccoli, I was impressed. But when she came back to the table, he didn't do that half stand thing every man should do for a woman. But he didn't eat when she was gone, and he gets props for that. We had a really good time, but I'm so tired I just can't write. I'm going to bed, I will be babysitting in the morning, kill me, thanks bye!

      I forgot to tell you all about something really funny. I got out of Spanish a little early, and so Erica and I headed to the commons. There we ran into Margaret, Ann, and Lauren harassing Trisha. They showed us how they were being bullies and it was sooooooo funny. When Margaret left, Ann and Lauren let me try to be a bully. AHHHH! Trisha retaliated against us and held an open water bottle. When we all pushed her, IT GOT EVERYWERE!. And by everywhere, I mean all over ME! But it was really funny and worth it. I'm going to go pick up my pictures! bye bye!

      This afternoon was VERYYY FUNNY! We had another Youth-2-Youth chapel. One of the guys rambled off statistics for like 20 minutes! He was stuttering since he was really nervous, and I laughed at him. Then this kid talked about how he used to get drunk a lot, but he didn't like it, cause he threw up. He didn't like waking up to a trashcan full of VOMIT, as he put it. I laughed. I mean I felt bad, but he was getting graphic, and girls were grossed out. Then I had a very unproductive study hall. I sat in the library with Elizabeth and Sammy. I was telling Sammy that I am allergic to flea bites, and that when I get them they get all large and pussy. I meant that they're full of puss, but I definitely didn't say that. People in the library laughed in judgement. Talked to Margaret awhile, and Elizabeth revealed to Margaret that she had been mean to me and I was sad. But I told her I let it go, but now she knows.  We went in Meghan's car to tutoring. When we were pulling in, everybody kept looking at us awkwardly. Little did we know that tutoring was canceled AGAIN. ERIN MCCAFFERY, GET IT RIGHT! We went to Starbucks and got some stuff. Meghan got a cranberry type of food and it was good. Then I saw Sarah Gold's brother, and I shouted, "ISAAC RULES!" then I waved and he was really confused. Mrs. Gold pulled up next to us to see who was harrassing her son, and I don't think she remembered me. We drove back towards school, and we saw this middle school boy and girl who were getting all snuggly, so Meghan beeped the horn and I "woo hooed" at them. They were in SHOCK! HAHAHAHAHAHAAH! I was gonna get my backpack out of Meghan's trunk but she kept pulling away. GRRR. So then I went home. Now I am here.  Ooh and apparently somebody's really attactive brother came to school yesterday. MICHAEL KELLEY RULES! ahahahahah, Ann doesn't read my blog, so she will NEVER know I just said that. But I tell her everyday anyways. I am going to force her to let me watch the Apprentice tomorrow at her house. It probably won't happen, but I will let you know if it does.  I just want to mention Jessica Tidd, cause I love her. And she's really, REALLY FUNNY!  Thanks bye!

      First off: HAPPY BIRTHDAY SAMMY! I know it didn't feel like your birthday, and there were a few mishaps after school, but I hope you had a great day and I know you have a great year to come! Well it has been brought to my attention what has happened to one of my friends concerning her blog. I know she doesn't want everybody to talk about it, but you know who you are, I have your back! NOBODY MESSES WITH MY FRIENDS AND GETS AWAY WITH IT. That said, *****ATTENTION***** CHAIR NAZI: you know who you are. You work in the library, and you HATE ME. You have tried to make my life a living nightmare since I was in your advisory in seventh grade. P.S. why have I had you THREE TIMES AS AN ADVISOR? I was mad every time. I don't like you. Nobody at school likes you. I hope you read this. There is nothing wrong with what we say here, we do this on our own time in our own homes. Stop pulling kids out of the library by their ears. Stop harrassing my friends. Nobody likes you. p.s. stop dressing like MC Hammer. Nobody likes you. I don't like you. I hope you read this. You hurt my friend. Nobody likes you. Bye.  Anyways, that made my blood boil, and I do not like the chair nazi (credited to Liz Dawg). Today was not very funny. Nobody said "indianistically" to me. I thought I told you to all say it. Dr. Doden kept saying gross stuff in class. He had to, but it was gross, like "turtle sex" why Toni Morrison? Why would you make my male teacher say that? Why did Beloved have sex with Paul D, why? AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHY DID BELOVED TRY TO BREAST FEED WHEN SHE'S IN A TWENTY YEAR OLDS BODY. it was gross. But the book is good, read it. Mrs. Potts was mean to me again. Every time she says my name, I start to hyperventilate and I get sweaty and nervous. My brain goes completely blank and I just can't think. Ann tries to help me, but it's no good. Mrs. Potts doesn't like me. Ask Ann and ask Anna. Mr. O'Grady was funny today. He said, "Now a 17 year old young male wants the fun of being a young man. But when he fathers a child, does he want the responsiblility of being a young man? No, he runs away and joins the Navy." I was the only one laughing, but well that's my life anyways.  The he said, "Mr. O'Grady will lose weight, when he has a heart attack." OHH MR. O those damn seductively good doughnuts! I actually like that class, I'm about the only one. In Chem, Doc goes, "Did I ever tell you that story about the man who wanted to kill his wife, so he put her body in a bat of sulfuric acid and then threw it in a pit of gravel?" NO! Actually, it was interesting. Scotland Yard knew that she had a gall stone, and found it amongst the gravel! Then with organic chemicals, they found all her fat, and it matched her weight. Then the hung the guy.  Senora told us all today that she would be mad if we failed our National Spanish Exam, "Don't you fail, or I will ecome to your ahome and I will akill you!" WHAT?!?!?! AHH! She was kidding and didn't mean it, but it was really funny.  In lab, we were talking about my evil father, and he was like "Well you know most mixes (being that I'm biracial) are weird looking, but you're alright." THANKS DOC!  That was pretty much it. My feet smell and I am enjoying a Wild Cherry Pepsi. My mom and I went to Target, and that was my present. I'm not used to regular soda, SO I GET A LITTLE CRAZY. Spring break is just so near that I just can't do homework. But I must try.... Bye! P.S. Nobody likes a chair nazi

      Hi. Today had some good stuff, so I will share. It started out just a normal, obnoxious monday. In English, I thought the day would never end, and I wanted to cry. Third period rolled around, and Mr. O'Grady was picking on me, as usual. We talked about social security and how our generation is going to get NOTHING. I asked Mr. O'Grady if he would vote to have us put into social security, knowing full well we'd get nothing, and he was like "I like you, but I like myself more. So when I vote, I'll be thinking of Allison." O'GRADY DAMN YOU ! Then I was following Elizabeth and Jo Bo Jo to see Jiggle (if you don't know Jiggle, I spit on you! Come on guys, the amazing vending machine! Remember Troilus' boobs were jiggling!)Anyways, when we were walking back into the dining room, these middle schoolers practically pushed me into a table, so I shouted out, "Hey middle schoolers! Learn to get out of my way!" That was nice. Then Chemistry class. Well for those unies out there, you know that the robotics team came into contact with a stomach virus and were all messed up on their trip. This included, everybody's favorite, Doc. IMAGINE HIM THROWING UP, "BLAAAAEEEEEEEEBLAAAEEE". But in reality, EC said it sounded really low, gross. I apologize. So our sub is Dr. Nzg.. I don't know. But he was really cool. He was from the Congo and spoke about a thousand languages. Then Sam says, "so what were the houses made of?" I turned to EC and said, "Jesus, why doesn't she just ask him if he wears paint and dances around a fire?" OH SAM! I visited Dr. Doden during my fifth period study hall. We talked about me being stupid, it was fun. But first I had to drag him from Pryor's room and he was being mean to me, and I was like "Hey! I have dirt on you, but I can't say it cause I'll get in trouble." I really need to learn how to defend myself. I ran into Ann and she said my blog was Shameem quality. It was really nice, but untrue. Shameem is the blogmaster. She will always be number one. Plus, she's full Indian, unlike my half, therefore she's Indianastically good at everything. I made that word up, just so you know. It's like in "Never Been Kissed" when they make up the word "rufus" and everybody starts saying it. Well I better hear the word "Indianastically" tomorrow at school. In Spanish we talked about "Las Medias Rojas" ("The Red Socks") and how Ildara's dad thought she was a prostitute. EC, who was in robotics when we talked about it, didn't pick that up, and I was like, "EC, come on her hair and those seductive red socks" yeah I don't know, it was funny. BUT THEN! THIS IS SOOOOO EMBARRASSING, so naturally I will share it with all of you (and by that I mean like my 3 viewers, what up Liz Dawg). We broke up into small groups, mine was myself, Erica, EC, and Christina. Erica asked what to do about split ends. I suggested getting a hair cut, but she said she had them at the top of her head. We all concluded she would then need to shave her head. I said, "you would be bald, like my dream ass!" AHH See, because I am indian, I am very hairy, so naturally I tell everybody I have a hairy butt, well EC was grossed out and Christina just stared at me blankly. Nice times, nice times. We had cookies for lunch, yummm. At activites we looked at pictures of dogs. I know, thrilling. Then I went to AP Spanish. I'm taking the test- May 4, 8 am. Wish me luck. But we did these exercises where this tape mutters off a question, and you have twenty seconds to answer. It is really difficult, because I mean who can understand the question and then answer in 20 seconds?! Not me, that's fo sho. Well EC was taking a turn, and she kept rushing her answer and missing the beep. So after like the fifth time missing the beep, she shouts out "GOD DAMNIT!" ahh Pryor is a fool. Then we talked about boy bands, and he goes, "I wish there were more girls in Britney Spears" first of all she's not a band/talented. and I told Talia that "he wants to see more naked girls" and he goes "that's not what i said?!" EWW PRYOR DIE. Then I had eighth free, and I did my math homework.  I walked to my car with Eri, and that was fun. Then I sat in Ariel's car for like a half an hour and listened to Something Corporate, cause she's a loser who likes Hillary Duff- boo I know. I told her all about my favorite concert times. Calling William pretty, sneaking onto the SoCo bus, etc. Then we drove home, and we were side by side, and all of a sudden it starts to snow! We were both looking at each other dazed and confused.  I came home and played with our new cheese grader. It was fun, and I ate a lot of cheese. Then I channel surfed, instead of being productive. I saw Tom Cruise talking to Oprah, and my blood was boiling! HOW COULD THAT LITTLE SHORT UGLY MAN DIVORCE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN THE WORLD?! Eww he should be shot. And he was  all, "she's blazzing right now..." EWW I'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR OSCAR SHIT FACE. I just hate him. And then I watched Room Raiders, it was really one of the best ones. This guy kept talking about him needing to be in a boy band, and that he was Justin Timberlake. He also drove a car, that on the hood said, "Playboy 1". Oh god! The girls were, I know this is mean, but they were really hit. The first girl was the bisexual, as she said "bad jewish girl" with piercings everywhere. Then there was an obnoxious cheerleader. And finally, this homely little girl who said, "I get straight A's. If I don't, I'll die!" THIS ALL CREATED A VERY EVENTFUL SHOW!  He ended up picking the cheerleader, OF COURSE. He was like, "I picked you because you tried out for "American Idol" and you're into actressing". Right, that's a word. Oh and his room was COVERED with pictures of naked girls. He had playboy cubic zirconium earrings, why? It was fun.  My mom came home and gave canned food to all the animal. Always a bad idea. Snickers goes crazy and likes writhes from pain, I don't know he should die.  I have to clean my room. It literally is messy. I counted 12 water bottles. And my carpet, is an unknown color anymore. The dirt is so thick that I can feel it in my toes.  This funny thing happend at the play on Friday. I asked Dr. Doden if we could meet on Monday fifth period, and he goes, "No. Cause I don't like you, you're too short." AHH my dream response was, "you're too hairy!" Though, I'm not one to talk. MEGAN QUINN TOOK DR. DODEN'S PICTURE ON MY CAMERA TODAY, IT WAS AWESOME.  Well, I should do homework bye!

      OH GOODNESS. I have NO words to describe what has just happened. I just saw the world's WORST movie!So I get in a fight with my mom and I want to leave the house. But as always, I don't want to go to Easton, so I made Elizabeth swear to my cat that over spring break she'd learn how to drive to Lennox, and he approved her request by meowing.  I really hate Lizzie McGuire, but I really like Lindsey Lohan. So we go to see Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT SEE THAT MOVIE. The music is SHIT. If I have to hear that "Uh oh..." song one more time... THEY PLAYED IT 7,000 TIMES IN ONE MOVIE! It was the worst acting and the worst script ever! Earlier, it was really gross, because I decided that since Simple Plan is in that new Olsen twin movie, and they're apparently friends with Lizzie McGuire (who sucks balls, but not Aaron Carter's cause he's a wimp) (p.s. I used to love all the carter boys!), I've decided that Simple Plan is made of several petifiles. Anyways, the movie was getting really bad, and then who do they play... jesus are they in every movie about a young girl- CREEPY! So this guy comes into the movie with this little girl (I know with my previous statement, this seems to be bad, but it was just his daughter) and he tells me that he dropped his wallet and starts digging around for it near me. Then they sit down, next to us, out of an entire empty theater. But then they left, but in their place several gangs walked in. It was really weird. The movie kept getting worse and worse, and so did my anger. I shouted out a lot of random obscenities, such as "I'm going to jump into the screen and snap your neck!" There were some kids there, but they could take it. In the last 10 minutes, a whole group of people walk in and go into the row behind us, with their coats dangling over the seats, smacking us in the face. The ending was really predictable and it was just such a shitty movie, we didn't wait for the credits, we just left. We ran to our cars, cause that movie sucked balls. Bye!

      HEY HEY! Well some crazy stuff has happend in the past two days, so here goes. Yesterday was pretty average and then I had kickboxing. Man, it was rough. I've done the Billy Blanks tapes. And you know, this is a really buff guy, but he's so nice and always saying "if it's too difficult, just modify it. You'll be okay" Well Ms. Standley, is quite different than our good friend Billy Blanks. She made us sprint, do jumping jacks, and so on. That's all fine and dandy, but we hardly did the kickboxing part. And she was all "PUSH IT YOU LARD ASSES!" Well she didn't say that, but man she wanted us to move. It was really funny.  After school, I went to Meghan's, cause as I said before, we were going to go see Junior Revolution. When we got inside, I had like 15 bags, and I ran into a chair, that was funny. Then we were doing some homework, and while she was walking her dog, I tried to print my spanish homework, but the pages never came out and I thought I broke the printer. Turns out, you have to pull out the tray so the paper can come out. OOPS! As we were leaving, Meghan completely wipes out on the steps in the garage, I mean wipes out! She had to be in so much pain, but I couldn't stop from laughing.  We headed to Cosi before the conert. Okay, don't go to the Polaris Cosi, it's messed up. We had a really bad waitress and there was this guy and girl humping in front of one of their families, it was gross. And you know how there are paintings on the wall? Well, this one lady comes over and is standing right in front of our table looking at the paintings. Then she was talking to her daughter, and she thought I was the artist, because I was the one sitting by it and she goes, "Oh look, she's shy!" WHAT THE HELL LADY?! Chelsea from Westerville South does NOT live by the painting, therefore there is a chance that I might not be the artist! The food was really greasy too, and I had a stain on my shirt that looked like poop. It was gross. Then we headed towards Midgard. I was singing to "Hey Mickey" or whatever and having some fun. So we enter, and there are literally five people there. We stood against the wall as the first band finished, and then we spotted the guys from J Rev! It was really exciting. Meghan kept telling me to go over there, but I couldn't. This girl went and tried to talk to them, and they completely shut her down, so I was worried that they would do the same to me. When she finally got the hint and left, we walked over there, and my heart was racing. I don't know why, I just get really nervous. But we did, and they were really nice. We only really talked to Chris (the drummer) and Brian (the bassist), oh yeah and the merch guy. They were really nice and we talked about their show with Something Corporate, and where they were from, and of course we talked about CSG, cause that's basically my entire life's purpose. I told them I was the girl that had been e-mailing them like 7,000 times, in reality twice, and they remembered. We also talked about my two difficult tests the next morning. That was exciting. They signed my concert shirt, and I let the merch guy as well, but the guy who looks like Bob the Bachelor was kind of mean. But I still got the autograph. So Chris says he's from Akron, and oh god I don't know why, but... I asked if he had heard of the Oliver Ocasek building!!! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH no I know! Oliver Ocasek is my late great uncle and he used to be President of the Ohio Senate. I  couldn't think of anything to say so that's what I said! He looked at me, said no, and the conversation pretty much ended. So after another band we thought and hoped that J Rev would be next. I asked Brian, and he said that there was still another band to go. Well I'm sorry, but I had two tests the next day and we had to be home by 10! It was like 9 and there was no way in hell we'd see them. Brian was really nice and he kept coming over and apologizing that we wouldn't be able to see them and that they didn't know all the other bands were going to take so long. So then we talked a lot more, and I made a fool of myself some more times. We talked about having them play at Senior Day, hem hem class 05, this is a really good idea. Even Meghan likes them, so they'll play, okay that's settled. While we were talking, I was really pissed that the band setting up wouldn't go faster, and Brian goes, "Geez you're ready to just kick them off stage" and I was like "Well, sometimes I get a little aggressive!" It's true, I have about as much patience as I don't know, somebody without patience. He kept trying to talk about what they were doing, but apparently I kept going back to hanging out with Something Corporate. I'm sorry, I just love them. So the band Soma begins to play. Oh dear, they're weird. The lead singer is about 35, with a full beard and bald spot. The guitarist looks like he's been ripped out of the Darkness video, and the keyboardist is either wearing the best bell-bottoms ever created, or a long denim skirt. Either way, I just don't know. The singer was really annoying and looked out into space and couldn't concentrate. Then he went outside, with the mic, and was like "What the fuck are you doing outside? Don't you know Soma's playing!?" Then he came in and entertained us all with his magical flying middle fingers and his constant badgering of us all by calling us "maggots". Thanks, I really support you Soma. Actually, it was really funny.  Half way through their performance, we had to leave. It was really awkward, cause I didn't know if I was supposed to say goodbye to Brian, since he was standing next to us, or not. So we did. He apologized to us and gave us a hug and then we left. Oh and he told us to get home safely. It was nice. And Meghan was like "he likes the brown flava" but I thought she said "he likes the brown Frida". You know that Spanish woman Frida something, who looks like  man? I thought she was saying I looked like a man, but she wasn't and it was just funny.  So we didn't get to see them play, but it was neat to talk to the band, and I told them I would be there Columbus spokesperson, and they were weirded out but whatever! P.S. Brian told me that Will left Something Corporate, so I promptly called Elizabeth.  When we got back to Meg's, I noticed a nice couple of skid marks she left on the stairs from her fall and I laughed, a lot. Then we watched this horrible Primetime about Colorado City and theif ass prophet who makes 15 year olds marry like 40 year olds. It was foul. Then we laughed in bed for a long time. And the next morning I kept hovering over Meghan to get her up.  Today was pretty boring, people were mean to me, and p.s. SENORA pryor, stop being a bastard to me, cause we all know that you want to have sex with all your students you perv. I hate you. And your kids are ugly. So just never speak again, thanks bye.  Well I will be attending the school play tonight. Hope my friends do a great job, I know they will!

      Hello all, my feet stink! Well, Ann told me I had to blog everyday, but she also told me she'd read it everyday. So, Ann I am expecting a description about this entry tomorrow morning. Anyways, today was pretty funny. Nothing good happened till about sixth period, Spanish. Senora goes, "Well you know my sista, you know the one who is out to aget me." First of all, what the hell does that mean?! Then she goes, "When I went to Costa Rica over the awinter, we went to the abeach, and she atried to smoke. I said 'Why are you acting like that? You are not asophisticated!' And you know ladies, oh you are all so abeautiful, but when I was ayoung all the agirls would you know smoke in the bathroom. But it tasted so disgusting. I told them, 'Why whould I waste my time hanging out in a bathroom?!' And when I was in acollege I went to a party and they were smoking marijuana. But God gave me a natural high, so I don't have to ado that stuff." OH SENORA! And Sam kept saying she was adopted, even though her mom is her real mom.  So chapel consisted of yet another honor code meeting. Well, I was sitting on stage, and guess who appears in one of the doorways. SALZAR MY NEMESIS! See, she told me in golf that I was useless, and hopefully would "find [my] niche someday." Hey Salzar, I'M NOT THE ONE WHO IS 8,075 YEARS OLD AND WORKING AT THE SAME SCHOOL, AFTER THEY ASKED ME TO STEP DOWN FROM MY POSITION BUT I WAS TOO STUPID TO GET THAT THEY WANTED ME TO GET THE HELL OUT, BUT INSTEAD I AM TEACHING FIRST GRADERS TO HOPSKOTCH AND JUMP ROPE. YOU ARE RIGHT I AM USELESS, UNLIKE YOU IN YOUR STUPID PURPLE JUMP SUIT. p.s. DIE! So I saw her there, and I could tell she was wondering what I was doing up there, and I glared at her for like 5 minutes to let her know, that yeah I can't hit a ball, and yeah my snacks will never be as good as Kacey Ording's, but LOOK I'M NOT USELESS. Anywho, Health was really funny. I thought the knocked up chicks would be there, but they weren't. But it was still funny because half way through the woman goes, "shocking" JUST LIKE TRISHA. The whole class just stopped and then burst out laughing, I mean it was EXACTLY like Trisha does it. SO WEIRD! Then we learned that some guy raped a 5 year-old because, "she was coming on to me." EWW sick I know. But then Uli goes, "it's like the baby's at my breast so I better give it milk." It was really funny.  So tutoring. Well, I drove and I'm really bad and I kept doing a creative dance to the music, Something Corporate of course. This obnoxious kid sat with Elizabeth and kept saying I had yellow teeth. Little brat. Well the problems they had to do were really difficult, but Libby taught me a lot. Then we played this circle of life type game. Everybody had an animal: grasshopper, mole rat, or hawk, and then you had to eat whatever was below  you on the food chain. We were all grasshoppers and we had to hop and our boobs were flying! AHH Then Darius says to Meghan, "I'm gonna eat you" and I was like... "OOOH kinky" and he goes "I'm gonna eat you too!" AHH it was really funny.  When I got home I was really excited because Googly (aka Oswald/Ozzy/Google, my cat) welcomed me home and he's really cute. Now I'm just really excited for the OC and for tomorrow: J REV WITH MEG! It's gonna be kick ass, cause we're getting Cosi and the spinich and artichoke dip is SOO GOOD! But it leaves my breath really nasty, and I am worried because "I'm gonna be shoving my tongue down people's throats" at the conert. I said that to Meghan, it was gross. My feet smell... RANK! AHAHAHAHA! BYE

      HELLLLLLLLO PEOPLE! I was inspired today to create one of these things. But I realize I'll probably post five times and then quit. Anyways, this year has been super busy, as all you fellow unicorns know, but we are less than a quarter left to go until May Program and summer, and then... SENIORITIS BABY! I am really excited for that.  So last night the scariest thing happened. I was talking on the phone and suddenly the lights started flickering on and off very quickly. Then, the TV blasted on and it was VERY loud! So, I put the phone down and shut off the TV. When I came back, the phone kept making clicking noises and when I looked at the caller ID box, it was in a foreign language! Then my mom suddenly arrived home and screamed out my name, all causing me to go into hysterics. I asked Doc about it today, to see if there was any scientific reason that all that stuff would happen at once, his response: "I think God hates you!" Well there you have it folks, my genius chemistry teacher is crazy! I am really excited because I'm going with Meghan to see j. rev on Thursday (for all you crazy kids out there who don't know, that is Junior Revolution), but I'm tight with the band, see? So I am able to call them j. rev. I've titled myself their Columbus spokesperson, so everybody check out http://www.juniorrevolution.com and listen to their songs, they are really good! But I am a little nervous since I have two tests the next day in Pre-Calc and Chemistry, oh dear I'm pretty much done. I've been preparing all week so I won't leave my major studying until Thursday, but alas the stress of a unicorn is much to handle.  I'm freaking out for comments which are coming soon, I have figured out what all my teachers will say:  Dr. Doden: "Allison, geez, what can I say? She is always hanging around me trying to get in my good graces, but I'm sorry, her lack of an ability to reach a thesis is just too much for me to like her. Oh and even though I told you on your last paper you had a thesis, I LIED! Which was evident when you got your paper back and it said 'thesis is WEAK'."  Mrs. Potts: "I'm not sure if Allison is just tired second period, or if she is really that slow. I ask her simple things and she can't even follow them. She needs to work on that, because it's embarrassing for herself."  Mr. O'Grady: "Oh Allison, even though I know it pisses you off when I call you a Republican, ha you are! Yeah that is right, you are shame to your whole family, did you guys know that? Allison's great uncle was the President of the Ohio Senate, yeah that's second to the governor. But he's rolling around in his grave out of disappointment for the lone Republican in the family. Oh and by the way, who took the Kennedy class?"  Doc: "EEEEEE! Oh AllEEEEson. Funny girl, but a little slow in chemistry."  Senora Chaves: "Oh Jorge is a girl very especial. She is okay at the espanish, but she lacks in the area of burbaarry and coach etc. She should really espend her money on epointless things asuch as designer clothes, because that is how you get an A in my class. P.S. Everything is just so beautiful!"  Well there you have it. Now I must go study aka watch tv. BYE!

      This morning I was carrying a lot of stuff. I grabbed my keys off the key rack, and I thought I heard something fall. But I just kept going. When I was driving I questioned what if it had been my mom's keys that fell. She would never look down and seen them. But then I thought, well it couldn't have been my mom's keys to fall, because she NEVER EVER hangs her keys on the key rack. Get home from school today: mom's car is in the driveway and there is a message that says "I've lost my keys, don't panic!" ANd where are her keys? On the ground under the key rack.  I went to school early to finish up my history works cited. The early kids have a lot of fun in the library. There are no evil librarians, so you can go crazy. I had my English presentation today. It was literally 10 minutes, no more. I don't care. Then I was walking back to my seat and I tripped and Dr. Doden said something sarcastic. I asked him if he feels he'll get fired often since he is crazy and has a lot of shenanigans, I think he was offended. Then I was explaining our idea of True Life: I'm a High School Senior at an All-Girl School, Dr. D is openly opposed to it. He thinks it would turn into a sex documentary. Crazy. Mr. O told us about Reagan's SDI idea. Okay no. Harnessing the power of the laser beam into satellites that can magically shoot down flying missiles-NEVER IN HELL WILL THAT WORK. PERIOD. We got a study hall in chem. Doc whipped out his change purse and put on some chapstick, I laughed! We watched Mar-mar's presentation in Spanish. It was really good and she thanked the class for all the good times at the end of it. It was so sweet! I went to lunch with Mrs. Ryan, that was okay. Then I had study hall. 8th period I had to meet with Fox Forever to discuss tutoring. Next week is our last week, it's a party thing, everybody come. I had to drive down there after school and talk to them- CRaZY! I talked to Maria during the day. She's awesome. She completely forgot I presented today in English, damn you Maria! Love that kid. WEll that's all for now-bye bye.

      I listened to Boxcar Racer on the way to school today. "I Feel So" perfectly sums up exactly what I've been feeling lately, I even think I will share the lyrics with you:  "I Feel So"  Sometimes I wish I was brave I wish I was stronger I wish I could feel no pain I wish I was young  I wish I was shy I wish I was honest I wish I was you not I  'Cause I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, again I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over  Sometimes I wish I was smart I wish I made cures for  How people are I wish I had power I wish I could lead I wish I could change the world  For you and me  'Cause I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, again I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over  'Cause I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, again I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over  I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, again I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over   Today when I was walking into school, I saw the most adorable puppy ever! It was tiny and white with brown spots. AHH it was so cute! I gave Elizabeth two pictures from my digital camera and she looked at them all day, I was glad to make her happy. We moved to our senior seats at announcements, I can't believe it is finally happening! I have to do announcements every day, of course, according to Mr. O'Grady, "Since the seinors aren't here Allison, you'll be doing announcements. But just for this year, next year it's all Steffie, NOT you!" Thanks, like I didn't know that, thanks. In English Sarah P. and Julia did their presentations, mine is tomorrow and I am freaking out. In the middle of Sarah's, Kristen just jumps up and starts screaming. I got really scared that something awful was happening, but she goes, "An ant just fell from my head!" and continued to scream. Everybody was silent, and then we just burst out laughing. Actually, I felt bad, she was really scared. It went on for like two minutes-ahh priceless. Math was kind of boring. Ms. King (Julie-hey now that you're a student no more formal names!) got something wrong, and we all felt bad. I felt bad for Ann too, cause she wanted to make the Student Council announcement this morning because she was  ACTUALLY  at that meeting, but somebody else did it instead. I think Ann would have done a better job anyways. I was kind of mad at Mr. O today. We were talking about how women can't be on submarines, because men can't control themselves and it is not safe for a woman. Since not enough girls want to do that, we're just not allowed. Mr. O kept saying it was human nature etc. No, I'm sorry. The reason why women can't go on a submarine, is beacuse they're down there for three months and men just can't keep it in their damn pants and will rape whatever they can find. That is not human nature. That is disgusting. Everybody should be in control of their own actions, that is not an excuse. It makes me sick. Why can't they just jack off in the corner, that is just bs if you ask me. I complained about it in study hall also. In Chem we watched a movie about batteries, but it makes no sense! EC kept nodding her head, but I was confused. I got my math done fifth period, that was good. We continued working on our Spanish projects, and EC and I finished finding all the pictures for our quotes. Before chapel I was harassing Ann about her brother, yet again! I am so sorry, but it's too fun to tease her. I was going on about how she promised we could be friends this summer, and Doc goes, "Who do you want to be friends with?" And I said Ann and he asked why and I said, "Because she has a hot brother!" AND he was shocked! Sorry Ann. I could not stay awake in chapel, once those lights come down the eyelids close up. I had lab and it was hard. Doc kept going on and on. He said something like "Allison Ansari I hope your grade is going far-y" OOH DOC. Then he goes, "The AP Chem kids missed a 20-point problem on their test that I know you could have done!" And I go, "Well, they talk a big game, but they can't walk the walk of Doc". I don't know, Sammy laughed. Hey, I respect AP Chem kids though, don't get me wrong. But my class is an AP in itself- It's DOC for God's sake! But if I don't have Doc next year I'll cry! The afternoon was really not good. I left school and had to turn around. Dr. D was supposed to copy my handout but I never picked them up. I couldn't find him, but eventually saw him in Pryor's room. He was like, "Why didn't you just get them tomorrow?" And I told him I wanted to staple them, but they had already been stapled. So I just left them in his room. Then I went to the library, pulled into the parking lot, and remembered I didn't have my library card. So I went home and watched an old Buffy on TV. It was such a good one, but then I cried cause it was the one where Riley said that Buffy didn't love him. OH GOD I LOVE YOU RILEY FINN. Well, I have two projects due tomorrow, kill me, thanks bye bye jar jar.

      FORGOT TO MENTION THIS!  So it was break. All of a sudden I see Catherine Bainbridge and Dr. Rogers walking towards each other. No words were exchanged between the two, but right as they passed, they slapped hands in mid-air! It was crazy!  When we were taking the AP practice test, Señor comes into O'Grady's (he had to teach 8th period) and goes "Keep going, I love you guys!" I was like "Dude, you're going to get fired!"  Ann and Megan and Trisha picked flowers and gave them to the Chair Nazi, I laughed really hard. Now I am procrastinating. Bye bye jar jar.   P.S. All that bear wanted was some s'mores!

      Today was pretty good, not really funny, but good. I can't quite remember anything that happened. Mrs. Potts made cookies for all her seniors with the name of their college. Everybody else got lemon bars, but they were really good. History was good. We were talking about Malcolm X, and Mr. O'Grady asked who Malcolm would report to after he became a minister, so I said, "Allah??" No it was that Elijah guy, but it was great. CP made brownies for our chem class and Doc asked if there was alcohol in them. I had to take a practice AP Spanish Language test and it was really hard. Ann and Margaret were running around and distracting me. It is so fun to just watch them interact with each other, you could do it for hours. After school I went to Walgreens to develop some digital pictures and drop off my Washington film. Now I'm at home with smelly feet. I'm talking to Ann and making her feel bad cause her brother's hot. I thought I saw Margaret's brother driving today and that was exciting as well. My parents are discussing sending me to visit California with my aunt this summer, because I'm apparently depressed and very suicidal right now. It's nice, but I really don't see me fitting in in California. Oh well, it would be a nice trip, and I've never been there. My nose still hurts from Friday. I wish it would stop being in pain. I love concerts. I have so much work to do, but I'm going to go to Bob Evans tonight with my mom- YES!

      CONGRATS TO THE CSG LAX TEAM, ESPECIALLY MARRRRRRRGARET! See Margaret, here you are! One of my best friends in English class. I have to help her open her mind to the words of Betty Friedan, but she gets into it sometimes. Margaret, Hi! Today was terrrrrrrrible. Maybe it was because Erica and I got home at 4 AM from the march in Washington, D.C. It was great, though! We left at 2 AM Sunday and got in around 10 or so. We had to stick with Fran Lamster, FRAN LAMSTER! Crazy lady. Our bus driver was so weird. He goes, "Maybe I'll find myself a widow" and some women shouts out, "RIGHT HERE!" Then when he let us out at a stop he goes, "Kinky". Why? I don't know. We marched and cheered with all the feminists/feminazis. OOOH Rush-you are a bastard. We sang chants like, "Hey hey! Ho ho! George Bush has got to go!" and "Pro-Life that's not right. You don't care if women die!" and carried signs like "I only trust my own bush!" AHH THAT WAS CRAZY! Cybil Shephard and Ana Gastier spoke, that was cool. It was really fun and moving to be apart of something like that. We left at around 7 and slept a lot. It was so hard to sleep on the bus. At one point, I was half-awake and I felt this arm around me and this body pressed against me. I didn't really understand so I didn't do anything. The next morning I asked Erica, "Did we spoon last night?" Yes, yes we did. We stopped for dinner at Breezewood and ran into these band kids, they were so obnoxious. We were in a hurry and carrying hot soup, but this kid did NOT move! So Erica was like, "HOT coming through!" And he dropped his soda, and that male bastard goes, "Look what you made me do!" Hey, don't blame us you dropped it. Erica just said, "It's your own fault, I don't care." or something. It was nice. We got home at 4 as I said and then slept and went to school for second period. We had a lock down practice and fire drill. Julia grabbed my boob. We kissed at prom and then she felt me up today, we're moving really fast, and I like it. Then the day was bad, I cried a little. I went to Chelsea's after school, and she tried to cheer me up. Congrats on Red/Gold captain my love. She couldn't come to SAT class and that was sad. It was the last SAT class tonight. We didn't do much, but I took pictures of everybody and laughed a lot. I'll miss those times. I have so much homework-goodbye!

      Ace, You have such a beautiful face. I want to taste your "bass". I hope that you're not chaste.   That was my poem I made up during the Less Than Jake/Early November/The Reunion Show/The Academy concert. I really love Ace, as I'm sure you can all tell.   So Friday was lots of fun! I had a math test, but I missed the first problem, and it is really bugging me! We ate lots of Cracker Jacks in History, cause we were watching a movie about baseball and Jackie Robinson. I had gym, again! I swear, I have that class everyday, and Ms. Standley is such a hard ass! She makes me sweat, A LOT. I was the only one to do my homework, so I was teacher's pet, and everybody judged me. Alice is just so funny in that class! She's so tall, so it's hard to do all the kicks and stuff, you just have to watch her, love that kid! She and I have to make up the class we missed, even though they just walked around Bexley-so not fair! After class, Liz and I rushed to get ready to leave for the Newport. We got there...and nobody was in line, except these twelve year old kids and their parents we see at every show! We walked around the campus a lot looking for band members to stalk. Then we went back to the line and met these girls from Michigan. All of a sudden, we see the Early November bus drive past, and everybody sprints to the back to see them. ACE IS JUST SO GORGEOUS. He's nice, too. Desire, this girl we see EVERYWHERE AND IS SO OBNOXIOUS, baked him cookies, bitch takin my man. HAHAHA KIDDING! We got some pictures, and I was like "Well this is what you get for being a rockstar". He was really confused, especially cause their music is not rock at all. We followed Ace and Joe as they went to Asian Yum Yum, but we went back to the line and talked to the Michigan girls for the rest of the time. One of them wanted to go find Sergio and get a picture. I went with her, and I kind of wish I hadn't. I like gross stuff, but this was weird. We go over and she asks for a picture, and he goes "Okay, but let's get my shirt in it". Well, he was wearing a tank top where the arm hole is cut really low down the side. He put his arm around her, then folded all the extra material over so that his nipple was exposed! For some reason, I just got really creeped out. She and I went back to the line, and Elizabeth and I told them all about CSG and the Señor finding everybody's blogs. They were really interested-guys we need to do True Life: I'm a highschool senior at an all-girl school, NOW. I saw this sophmore I see at every concert, she's always like "You're stalking me." Dude, no. You're obnoxious and you never leave me alone. She came over and said that, and I said, "Okay so get out of here." But she didn't leave! AHHHH. Then we met up with some other kids we knew and they got to do an interview with Joe, from E11. They let the pre-show kids in and we got right up by the barrier in the middle-a fantastic view! The first band, The Academy, didn't come on for a long time. They finally did, and they were really good! The lead singer was adorable, but he reminded me of Jessica from "I want a famous face" you know the girl who was really a guy-this boy was just so gangly and feminine looking. I would have bought their CD if I wasn't completely broke. The Reunion Show was next. Their music is not my favorite, but the crowd went NUTS! There were so many crowd surfers, it was just bad. But I laughed the entire time! I couldn't help the crowd surferers, cause I'm just too short. It was bad, Elizabeth would guard my head and the Security Guards would tell me to duck, it was kind of embarrassing. One of the guys in the band was crazy and really funny. He would jump down into the barrier and sing and it was great. One time, he came over and stood right in front of me, and put his guitar in the air and was right in face. I kind of freaked out, but it was awesome! I laughed so hard, it was so painful, and so funny. One time I was laughing, and Elizabeth got pushed towards me and her boob is right at my mouth level, and it went in, and at the exact same time I closed my mouth. I BIT HER BOOB, OOOPS! The Early November came on, then it started getting out of control. Ace was gorgeous, of course. They played hard and were rockin, but the crowd was so bad. One time a crowd surfer was coming, and their crotch hit my head with their legs on either side of my face, and this caused me to bang my nose into the metal barrier. I couldn't feel anything for five minutes. I thought I had broken my nose, but I think I'm okay. Sergio, one of the band memebers, was bleeding all over his face. He said he "busted up his skull" and there was blood everywhere. Well, it was mixing with his sweat, causing easy rubbage all over. When they ended, we left the pit. I'm not the biggest Less Than Jake fan, and I wanted to get out. It was hard to leave, but some people were really nice and let me through. We met some of the first two bands and then talked to Sergio and Joe. We watched the last band from the back, which was much better than the pit. Finally, ACE CAME OUT AGAIN! I got a hug, and enjoyed it. I told him about my nose, and he was really apologetic, not that it was his fault. I'm so sad that they're only playing on the Warped Tour on the West Coast, but oh well. All-in-all it was really fun!! When we were leaving we ran into Olivia Marcoux-coolest kid ever. Now I'm not doing my homework. I cleaned the cars today and got $5. I'm going over to Erica's tonight to leave for the March in Washington tomorrow. I'm super excited to protest Bush beeyatch. But I have to work on my English paper or I'll die next week. This weekend is awesome, have a good one!

       THIS IS A PUBLIC APOLOGY:   In an entry that was a conversation between me and Blaire I was talking about the rumor of me being stoned and drunk on prom night. I said that Trisha had spread this rumor, when in reality, I had only HEARD that she did this. That was my mistake and I shouldn't have posted that without it being clear that she may not have said that, someone told me that. I really was just laughing at Blaire's reaction, and I completely looked past what I had actually said. I apologize to this person, though they don't like me anyways. Thank you and goodbye.

I'm seeing Less Than Jake and the Eary November tomorrow. I'm really excited to just go crazy. Plus I LOVE ACE! I had a little pow wow with Lizzie and Erica at Panera yesterday and we discussed how we are going to get ACE, ACE, ACE, ACE, ACE to love me tomorrow!   So this is the plan:  Need: 1. Get a milkshake 2. Find hot man after his show Action: 1. Slowly walk up to him with milkshake in hand 2. Break out into a rendition of "Milkshake":          a) "My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard"                      aa. Use hands to motion him towards you           b) "and they're like it's better than yours" 3. Start smearing the milkshake on his face while thrusting your body in very unflattering movements 4. Begin to lick the milkshake off his face 5. Being a new song:           a) "I wanna lick, lick, lick you from your head to your toes"                       aa. Begin to violently lick this strange man's face           b) "and I wanna know what, what, what's your fan-ta-sy!"  6. Strongly suggest moving this party to his clip-on truck thing where the doors will be locked and his pants will come off  7. Congratulations, you've found yourself a rock star  So I think that will work. Too bad I have gym tomorrow and then have to bolt over to the Newport. Oh well, it's going to be CRAZY. If you thought I was crazy by being apparently "stoned and drunk" on prom night, wait til you see me at a concert--it's like I'm hopped up on Opium, OxyContin, straight Vodka, intravenous drugs, and I have a bad case of herpes.   Today was okay. Senor found Shameem's blogs, therefore ALL ACCESS TO THE LAND OF CSG BLOGGING COMMUNITY. OUR ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE! WHAT WILL WE DO!? He's too wimpy to do anything, anyways. I helped Ms. King with a math problem today, she's so great! We're both worried about the test tomorrow. Tiarra baked me cookies and everybody was sweet again. Okay so yes, elections have come and gone, and it didn't go the way some (hem hem me) might have liked. Without boring you, I'd just like to say a few things that I learned yesterday: 1. Nothing is more important than the loyalty of your friends and family. I never knew how many people cared about me. People cried with me and told me how important I was and how much they loved me. I was never alone in the day, somebody was always with me taking care of me. I love everyone of my friends. My mom cried all day and so did her co-workers. You never think people care, but they really do, so don't forget it. 2. Even if you don't win something, never back down from what you believe in. I could have given the sugar cookie speech, it probably wouldn't have helped, but it could have, but don't do that. Stand behind what you believe in no matter what, you'll never regret staying true to yourself when it ends up the way you weren't hoping for.  3. Don't be afraid of failure. I always have been, but it taught me how amazing and lucky I am to have friends like I have. It was a sucky thing to make me realize that, but I learned something very important. So you might fail at the task at hand, but you will take away something much better.  4. Keep living and take care of those who helped you, they will really need you one day, so show them how much you love them. With that being said, thanks to all my unies who have supported me, I love you soo much! Liz, Eri, Anna, Ariel, Katie, ANN ELISE KELLEY (SWEETEST GIRL EVER!), Alana, Christina, my locker buddies Nikki and Kristen, Georgia, Chels... EVERYBODY I LOVE YOU GUYS SOOOOOOOO FREAKING MUCH!   So I must do some homework! Have a good night!

      One last thing! I was in Lab today, and who do you think shows up for a surprise visit??? ZAZU! Doc tells her that if she's going to stay, she needs to wear goggles, she asks why, he says just cause we're working with bleach. So she goes and gets one of those masks that has the entire sheet of plastic which covers your entire face, and walks around the room like it's infected with the deadliest gas on earth. God, she's so obnoxious. It was CLOROX!

      I'm back! I forgot to talk about SAT class last night. Chels didn't come. But we only took the test, so not many good things happened. Well the annoying girl was annoying, as usual. WE made bets on how late the boys would be. I WON! The Indian boy came in with a green polo, collar up, and a green trucker hat on. It said, "Pimp daddy". Yes, it was fantastic. Hank, the white boy, came in in his shin guards and slippers. Nobody knows why. I started talking about how St. Charles calls CSG the dog pound, but nobody understood. And I was rambling about how, "The brain is the sexiest part of the body. We are all beautiful AND intelligent at CSG" Yeah, that's me just telling myself that. Well I must go be productive again, and by that, I mean read blogs. BYE

      Hello everybody out there in blogging land! These days... I tell you. But throughout it all, funny stuff has happened. The other day in English, somehow we start talking about periods and products that you need for your period. Dr. Doden starts going on, "I have to have my wife write twenty adjectives to describe what she wants. I mean super and little, and these electronic wing things!" We were dying! The other day in History I got a lot of gold stars, but Mr. O'Grady was going on about WWII, "So Truman became president..." and I said, "Five days after Lincoln..." AND I JUST STOPPED. Everybody was looking at me strangely, and Mr. O said, "No, Lincoln was shot five days after Lee surrendered, you're getting the Civil War and WWII confused. That's what old people do!" Then a couple days ago, we were talking about bomber planes and he asked us what the names were. Nobody knew, so Mr. O said, "Fat man..." and I said, "And a little coat?!" MR. O'GRADY SAID, "GREAT MOVIE!" AHH TOMMY BOY RULES! Doc has been crazy as ever. Today, oh Sam. She goes, "So Doc means doctor? But your first name's Doctor also?" NO SAM, HIS NAME IS DANIEL DEWITT HALL, WE CALL HIM DOC CAUSE THAT'S SHORT FOR DR. DANIEL DEWITT HALL! That was embarrassing for her. Today I took candy into school, and at the end of the day I found in my basket my underwire from my bra, I told that story a few entries ago. I laughed really hard, out loud. So much is going on, I must go be productive. Bye bye!

      PROM 2004, BABY! So Prom was yesterday. I had three appointments. 1. Brows at Jacob Neal where I saw Ali Crawl. 2. Nails at Charles Penzones where I saw Allison Elia. 3. Haircut at Kenneth where I saw Ali Harris. Plus my name is Allison (Allie) it was just weird. The dance was fun, but I don't like rap, and that's all they played, except for three songs from  Grease  all in a row. I asked the DJ to play some rock, and he asked us what we wanted. Erica said "Linkin park!" He asked what song, and I said, "'Faint'"! Then he asked by what band and we shouted, "LINKIN PARK!" It was funny. Everyone looked beautiful! Ariel got bangs and I think they are gorgeous! I slow-danced with Julia. Everybody was making-out, which I find really gross. So she kissed me, it was great! We got a limo for afterwards. Our driver's name was Kareem, but he wasn't the basketball player. He was really hot, I have his number in my cell. We listened to good mixes by Elizabeth and cruised around town. We went to Waffle House at like 2 AM and it was packed! All in all it was good times, congrats prom committee! I drooled a lot in my sleep last night. Now I am really stressed. I have so much homework, and this next week is going to be pure hell! We are starting our final exam project in Spanish. In class, we were looking at an example slide for the presentation, and it talked about the story "Bodas de Sangre". If you don't habla espanol, that means "Weddings of Blood". Erica was like, "Bodas de Sangre??" And Senora said, "OH yes it is beauuuuuutiful!" AHH !I'm goning to Washington DC next Sunday for the Women's March. That will be a day gone for studying. And I'm going to the Less Than Jake concert on Friday, woo woo Ace will be there! The May 1st SAT is coming... THIS IS SO BAD. I am done for now. Bye bye, jar jar.

      So I haven't blogged in FOREVER, but some good stuff has happened. All I know is that in English, a few days ago, Dr. Doden was talking about his mom being a WWII veteran, and Ariel asked, "Was she a nurse?" And Dr. Doden freaked out, "NO MY MOTHER WAS A U.S. MARINE!!!" It was really crazy! Ariel was so embarrassed, but she didn't know.  SAT class was better than ever! Everybody remembers how last summer I lost my flip-flop down High Street when there was a flood, right? Well, Chelsea should know that you can NEVER wear flip-flops to SAT class, but she did. And as we sprinted across High Street, her shoe came off right in the middle. I had to run back and get it for her, since she was really wet and cold. This kid came in late and put his coat on its own chair, I thought that was funny. In the middle of the lesson, he said to the other boy, "I thought I'd seen a dude like you in White Castle." Then five minutes later the other boy said, "If it makes you feel any better, there's somebody at my school who looks like you." Okay, that was just the funniest thing that has ever happened. The class was crazy, as usual. The smart girl kept saying, "We can have a party at my house and burn our books!" Dude, nobody would go to that. That kid is just hogging Priya, the smart Indian girl, that Chelsea and I want to be friends with. I had this intellectual moment with the teacher, and all the kids thought I was a dork. Then this kid, Hank, was reading a section of the Critical Reading passage, and he said, "...the Wiliad" NO THE ILIAD YOU FOOL! Then one boy said, "There's only 7 hot girls in my school, and I got one of 'em." We were reading this question and there was this answer and it said something to the effect, "An elephant is drawing in the sand with a pebble or stick that he puts in his trunk" I MEAN WHAT IS THAT?!?! It was just really, really fun!  So now school is just boring. None of the juniors have brought their stuff for the Junior Picture. But we're doing it tomorrow, hopefully. Poor Uli is suffering so.  I had a hard Chem test today, I do not know my results. I really don't want to blog anymore. But before I go, I just want to thank everybody who has been so nice to me these past couple of weeks. The support and kind gestures really help me and make me feel better. I love my Unies, thanks guys!

      Happy Monday! School was some good times today. Liz brought me my copy of the Mest/FOB concert pictures! They were great! I returned a video and needed to renew a book about Elvis. The one librarian (copy nazi) renewed it until April 30, so I can stop coming back every two weeks. I walked into English... AND TRIPPED IN FRONT OF DR. DODEN! I got really feisty about feminist issues. Dr. Doden was like, "Rush Limbaugh calls feminists 'feminazis' but do you see feminists rounding up 6 million men and burning them?!" It was great! We had shorter classes again, thankfully! I didn't understand my lab AT ALL! Before chapel we played some "Crocadilla" that old school game. I was the "Grand Croc Master". Then we had to do flags... usually Lauren Smiley messes up, but alas it was my turn. Right before I was gonna go, Dr. Doden was like "Don't trip!" (since I already had today). I didn't trip, but the actual flag slipped out of my hand and was dragging on the ground. I laughed. Later he came up to me and said, "Well, you didn't trip, but you giggled!" It was true.  I have a Spanish test tomorrow, and I really don't understand. Wish me luck!

      Happy Easter to those who celebrate that! Last night I babysat from 5-1:15!!! The people I babysit for are really strange. First off, they're loaded. They have their own party van and they have an ice machine. Who has an ice machine in their home?? When they came home, the mom was like, "Our husbands dragged us to this party with nothing but pimps and whores! We were the only white people there!!!" Okay, I just want my money and to leave. So that was good. Erica and I want to take their party van to prom, but my mom said I couldn't ask.  Today I babysat at Church and then helped my mom with the Easter egg hunt for the kids. Those kids go crazy. Later, I found my underwire had come out of my bra. So, I pulled it out of my shirt, and my mom said, "What is that? A headband?" AHH YES THAT IS JUST HOW BIG MY BOOBS ARE. Thank you. I've been doing some homework and cleaning my room and eating candy. It's a fine life it is. I just got off the phone with my dad and I laughed. AHH, I am actually starting to like my dad, it's scary. Well I'm off to self-tan, one of my Easter presents (that and a Billy Joel CD). WAIT. Let me just tell you this! So I had a bad day a couple days ago, and my mom wanted to give me an Easter present early to cheer me up. So she pulls out... a Hot Topic bag and says, "Isn't this where you shop?" Oh mom! I only get band t-shirts there sometimes. Anyways, she got me a Warped Tour 2003 CD, which is pretty good, and a pair of earrings I kind of like. But then she gets me this pink t-shirt that says "Young and Angry" because she feels that is how I am. AHH I know! Then she gets me... platform flip-flops which are referred to by the receipt as "Black corset thongs" because the strap part has like leather X's across. They're pretty bad, my mom thought I needed tall shoes to wear, basically we're taking them back. It was nice of her anyways, though. Well goodnight!

      I really should be doing something productive, but alas here I am, blogging. I haven't in a while, but I have a really good reason. Let's go back to the beginning...(no this is not a dirty ho Hilary Duff song)... It was last Tuesday. I got up, felt a little weird but ate some breakfast, got ready, and was about to leave. As I came down the stairs, I felt like I needed to sit down, so I did. Then I thought I just needed some water, so I went to the kitchen sink and started to drink some water. Then I threw up. Twice. So, as the responsible girl that I am, I went to school. Yes boys and girls, I went to school after throwing up, let me tell you why: I had gym class that day. Welcome to the life of a unicorn, I went to school for gym. See, if you miss it, they make you make it up, and I just do not have that kind of time. So I took a plastic bag with me to school and was prepared for another day. In announcements, I started to feel bad again. Everyone told me to go home, so I went to the nurse's office. I laid down and then ate some crackers. I started to feel better, and I decided to go back to class. MY mom said if I got worse, I could call and come home. So I go to second period, and it got worse. I could hardly lift my math binder. It was like running a marathon. I was so cold and shaky, Ann thought I was an idiot, so I went back to the nurse after class. That was 9:45. I wanted to go home, so we paged my mom. I laid down again. Long story short, my mom NEVER got the pages and only called to check and see if the nurse had heard anything. I left school at 12:15. I know. SO I went home and slept a lot. And I stayed home on Wedenesday as well. My head hurt so much, I could hardly leave my bed. Wednesday night I felt better and was planning to go to school the next day. Thursday morning I woke up at like 5:30, screaming from cramps. Yes, I got my period right after being sick. I was writihing in my sheets from pain. I took like three Aleve and got out the heating pad and tried to relax. I swear, I thought I was going to give birth to something, I didn't know what, but something was coming out.  I went to school. Classes were shorter for Red/Gold day, which was nice. I told Dr. Doden I was back, and he asked me who I was. AHH DAMN YOU! I was really obsessed with Doden on Thursday. I got a good math grade and Ms. Potts was nice to me. Ms. King has been in our math class to prepare for her college classes coming up, and she's super nice and funny. I want to be her study buddy, cause she's going to take our math test. Chemistry was funny too. We played with the $10,000 computer with the touch-screen. CP was funny. I did sooo badly on my spanish test, I can't even tell you. Then I had AP spanish. We really have to work, since the test is coming up, but we talked about my problems the whole time. Senor was actually nice, for once. Then I went and told Zazu I was upset about what she said to me in the Student Council meeting, she apologized, but didn't mean it. Instead of the Red/Gold games, I had to go to the Honor Code meeting, BORING. That night was so fun, though. Erica, Lizzie, and I (or as I have now named us "The Raisn' Craisins") has some funnny times! We went to go see The PRince and ME, just to make fun of it. IT was bad and we made fun of it. But we took a bag of Craisins with us, and things got wild. WE threw them at people out the car and were screaming. In the movie, I offered a hand-full of Craisins to these girls next to us!!!!! We were super into stickers too. We went to CV Wrapers and stole the stickers they stick on your food. I had "BLT" and some others and my favorite "Mexican Burrito" cause people think I am MExican. I also had this sticker with a cow on it on my face. We had so much fun, the three is back! Friday me and Liz went to a concert. Eri went to look at some school in Indiana, so she couldn't come. We went to see Mest with Fall OUt Boy, Matchbook Romance, and Dynamite Boy. My sickness was still present. I couldn't eat anything, because I thought I was developing Acid Reflux disease. Everything burned down my throat. So I went with very little in my stomach. We got there at like 3. We wanted to meet Fall OUt Boy, cause we love them. But we waited for a REALLY long time. This one adorable man, with a lip ring, and a camo hat kept coming out. Finally he saw us sitting there after like three hours and kind of laughed, this is how it went down: Man comes out, sees us, and chuckles ME: "Yeah, we're STILL here" He starts to walk over: "That's okay, I don't care." Me: "We want to meet somebody!" HIM: "WHo do you want to meet?" Me: "Fall OUt Boy" Him:" THey're really nice, just go over there and talk to them!" Liz: "Are you in a band?" HIm" Yeah, Dynamite boy."   I felt really bad cause he was in a band I didn't know!   Anyways so we went over and the guy in the hat kept coming up and saying "JUst get in there, they're really nice!!" He was cool. In reality, the guys in FOB were kind of strange. The one named JOe, looked at my Mexican Burrito sticker and we ended up having a talk about races and religions, yeah I don't know. The good thing about these concerts is that you get to know a lot of people and you see them at every show. So we talked to some funny people. The concert was good. We were right in the front of the pit. There were moshers, but we were far left so it wasn't too bad. Except for MEst, I ended up holding onto the barrier with my right arm, and my body was completly to the opposite side. This girl had a spike belt on and when she would jump, we were so close that my shirt came up and her spike slid against my side. IT hurt. then one time my arms were crossed at the barrier, and when people on either side of me would jump, my own arms would choke me. I coudln't breathe  A LOT. That was bad, plus I was really hungry and my acid reflux hurt a lot. All the guys in the bands were friends and would come out and sing each others songs. Then they all hugged. I've never seen so many boys so touchy-feeley. It was worse than CSG. IT was funny. One band had their last night, and they threw flour at them at the end of their set. It was funny. Some girl threw up a tampon at Mest. This is gross, get prepared. Tony (lead singer) opens it up, says "you must be on the rag" and then puts the whole thing in his MOUTH! Then he starts going on about "the rag" and all that. HEY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE! It was funny though.  THIS IS THE LONGEST BLOG EVER, I need to go do something else. BYE!

      HIIIIIIIII I am depressed. AHH. Yes that's right, today sucked. But some funny stuff happened, so I will now make you laugh and cry. Here we go: I was going to my car this morning and I noticed a dog house in my neighbor's yard. I thought that was very peculiar, since I don't think that they have a dog. But then I saw this little dog sitting next to the dog house and it was the same color and it scared me. I felt really bad, cause the dog had frost growing on it, it was sad.  English was really funny. Dr. Doden said he hasn't watched TV since 1998, and I asked, "Dr. Doden, what do you do after dinner? Before dinner? AFTER SCHOOL???" Then I told them the story about my mom yelling at me and saying I sounded like a hyena, and nobody laughed. Oh well.  Then, third period, Mr. O'Grady yelled at me. I almost cried, it was really scary. Usually if somebody is talking, he'll just shush them and say we need to move on. But today he was reviewing WWII and asked me a question. I didn't know, and I looked at my notes, but he said it was from a long while back. But I didn't answer quick enough, and Katie gave him the answer. Then I was asking Katie a question on something, and Mr. O'Grady said, "Allison, you obviously don't get this, so you need to be quiet." I was so surprised he said that, it was really scary.  In chemistry, people kept talking about NYU, my dream school, and how it's so fashionable and now Mary-Kate and Ashley are going there and so on. I was saddened, because I'm nothing like them, and yet I want to go there because it's like one of the best business schools in the country. So I felt very discouraged. Then somebody asked me to copy their homework. I HATE THAT. I was up at 10:30 doing it, and she got to sleep, and now she can just use my work. OOOH I was sooo annoyed, she even had study hall before class to do it herself. That was just upsetting, I hate that.  Erica and I went to give blood during study hall. We ended up missing Spanish. Chair nazi sat in her chair and complained forever! There was nothing wrong, and she was fine, but she wouldn't move at all! This was our second time, and we weren't worried, but it got really bad. Erica was before me, and when she had finished giving, she started to feel really sick. They put a bag under her, in case she threw up. I was worried, and I didn't know if she had thrown up, because she wasn't speaking. Then when I was finished, all of a sudden I got completely messed up. They laid me back, and it was like everything in my stomach was swirling, I know that doesn't make any sense. I was breathing really heavily and I started to get really nervous that I would also throw up. But we were both okay. Amy threw up and Maria passed out. It was really bad for people. Lauren gave her blood in like five minutes and then was messed up. I don't know, it was a bad day to give blood. Then I got completely crazy and was talking about the valence above the window at my seat. I mean this bus had a window and a valence! AHHH I was going crazzzy! But then we went and ate a lot in the mansion- it was nice.  When we were heading back inside, we tried to go through the door in front of the theater. Some freshman had to let us in, then one said, "Uh I need to see your visitor badge" and was trying to be funny. Erica said, "Uh, you're a freshman!" I laughed really hard.  I had health and we watched a movie on drugs. Afterwards, we were talking about the punishments for drugs and we thought marijuana shouldn't be as harsh. I said, "Ms. Faidiga, can't we all just be guaranteed one joint? You know we are all going to do it!" AHH IT WAS THE BLOOD LOSS THAT MADE ME SAY IT! We went back to the commons, and one of the leaders had tossed that fake boob all the way to the ceiling of the commons, it was amazing! I got really depressed on the way home. It's these stupid bastard elections. When I was walking out to school, Mr. O'Grady was directing traffic, and I got nervous since he yelled at me today. But all he said was, "You better tell somebody you are running." Why do we have to talk about elections at all times? The only time I talk about it is when people bring it up. My mom thinks everyone just doesn't like me, and I feel the same way. It's so agitating. But she did say that if I lose, we are becoming RADICAL. If I lose the election, I am going out that night and getting my nose pierced, my mom said Zazu can deal with her, cause she doesn't care! My mom said I have to get pierced and tattooed and I am going to be really bad. It will be funny if it happens. So I'm stressed, and I haven't started homework, and it's almost 9. I watched  Chocolat  and enjoyed myself. Thank you, goodnight.

      Hiiiii I am back! THE FUNNIEST THING JUST HAPPENED. My mom makes the Easter eggs every year for the church Easter egg hunt . Therefore, there is soooo much chocolate in the house. Well Snickers, my appropriately named dog, got a bag of Hershey's Kisses. He then took it to his lair: under the desk. He has everything down there. That dog lives like a king. He had an empty bread bag, old tub of butter, a box of Girl Scout Cookies, and the list goes on and on. My mom saw that he got the bag of kisses, and immediately was trying to get it away from him. But not because chocolate can kill dogs, oh no, it was because "he'll be shitting that out for weeks!" So the dog is growling and not making it easy to get the bag of candy. We both cornered him but he wasn't giving. Then he ran into the kitchen and under a smaller table. This is where it got ugly. He was being so bad, that we got out... THE BROOM. We think the dog was beaten early in his life with a broom (we didn't get him until later on), so whenever he is REALLY bad we use that to piss him off. But he usually pees out of fear. I know that right now you are thinking we are terrible pet owners, but then you must not have met my dog. Anyways, my mom was poking at the dog trying to loosen his grip on the bag. Little kisses were flying out EVERYWHERE! Then my mom was sweeping them towards her away from the dog. I was laughing so hard, and still am. THe dog was FREAKING out and there was candy everywhere and it was complete chaos---TUMULT! Then I grabbed the broom and was sticking the stick end in his mouth in attempts to dislodge the bag. He started to run back towards his lair, and I freaked out and jumped out of the way. But then I was chasing him with the broom (sweeping part towards me) and trying to use the stick part to make the dog move towards the wall where I could grab it. It was sooo crazy. The dog took a detour and hid under the coffee table where my mom grabbed the bag of candy and made me put it away, it was really slobbery. I laughed so hard, I wish it was on video.

      Hello world! How's it going? I have been busy as a beaver lately. Who out there remembers Megan Mann (Keeny) and all her many stuffed beavers? Her favorite was that old one, Edgar. I liked Candlesticks. Bus 25 home from school=the best time of my life. Anywho... I went to the dentist the other day, it was FANTASTIC. Dr. Christ and I go wayyyy back. His hygienist, Phyllis, was a total beeyatch. He asked me what I was going to study in college, and I said business, and he said "Ohhh you could be on "The Apprentice" ahahhaha!" Then he was talking about my orthodontic treatment and he said, "Well it looks great. I mean could her teeth be any whiter Phyllis?" Phyllis was... absolutely silent. THANKS PHIL.  I took the ACT on Saturday, it was very hard. I took it at UA and I got really scared, cause they're attractive there. I walked in and saw Ann, we weren't in the same room but I told her I'd take her home. My room was boring. Kids were funny and it was crazy. Afterwards, Ann told me we had to find her friend Carrie. Turns out she was going to lunch with Carrie.. .and I don't know what my purpose was. But Ann said I could go with them. But then they ran into a third friend, and they kind of fought, and I wasn't sure if I should have left or stayed. But we ended up going to Panera, and we ran into EVERYBODY. It was exciting, as I've said, Unies can sniff each other out. So we ate lunch, and then we went back to Carrie's and she made me and Ann listen to this blue grass music. And she forced us to say we liked it. IT WAS REALLY FUNNY. Then I took Ann home and we were listening to this screaming song, and it was so different from the blue grass.  I babysat that night. I was a really good babysitter. But towards midnight, I could not stay awake, it was bad. I would nod off and then my head would fall. I came home and watched some Donald Trump on SNL. It wasn't that funny, so I went to bed. And then babysat again in the morning. Then I cleaned my room all day, and now I am not doing homework. Some other funny stuff has happened, but I don't want to write it, so you will all have to personally question me and my strange life. bye.

      It's been awhile since we've last spoken. Things still suck, but let me fill you in. Thursday was the last day of real May Program, thank God! Señor gave me $.76 and that was exciting. That night I went to Erica's to hang out. We did some of our favorite things: eat hot dogs and watch the travel channel. Her Spain trip sounded amazing! On Friday we saw old footage of the male teachers performing as BSB.. it was so funny. Then it ended, the screen went up, the music started, the curtains opened, AND THERE THEY WERE! We were screaming like mad. It was the best concert I've ever seen! That night I went to get my nose pierced. I did, I finally did. I'm not waiting anymore... it was awesome. I took my catholic friend, Ann. I also got my ear cartilage pierced, why not just go for it? When we were waiting, we were looking at this wall of really odd pictures. We were kind of laughing at this one, it looked like a woman with something on her stomach. That's when the man informed us she was a Siamese twin gone terribly wrong. It wasn't too funny after that. My mom and Ann told me that when he pierced my nose it was really creepy cause the needle was like hanging out... eww sorry you had to see that. It was fun nonetheless. That night I hung out with Anna, it was really funny. She bought something at Delia's and they said she could get some free candy. She let me pick it out, and I picked those wax bottles that you rip off the top and drink the juice. She'd never had one so we were really excited to try them. Well, we ripped it off and sucked down the juice. I thought it had gone bad, because it was incredibly sour. Her face was so funny. She was trying to pretend like she liked it, but was really grossed out, and I was like "No this isn't right!" Well, they were supposed to be sour, oops! I babysat on Saturday night. The little boy goes, "I didn't know your nose was pierced. It's really gross." Thanks, thanks a lot. Then I went to Cleveland with my mom. It was so nice to get away and spend time with people who actually care about me. I'm seriously anticipating summer. It's time for some big changes.

      In the words of a little boy I babysit, Aiden, "my allergies are taking over." They're so bad, I hate them. Today was really funny. I did terrible on my math practice test. No teacher showed up in College class... YES! We talked about tons of stuff. Emily was going on about stupid stuff. Flag football was crazy. Nobody wanted to do anything. I pulled a muscle from that damn hip-hop. I completely knocked over Margaret, then five minutes later socked her in the stomach. Then Ann was guarding Blair, and the frisbee was going right towards Blair, and I just yelled "PUSH HER!" Blair caught the frisbee, then Ann LEAPS into the air and pushes Blair's face right into the dirt. Ann kept saying, "The only thing I could hear was your voice inside my head, Allison!" I could not stop laughing for at least ten minutes. It was so funny, I wish you could have all seen it. SWING DANCING! We learned five moves in an hour and a half. We just did the same thing over and over again. This sexual song came on, and Sarah G and I started writhing all over each other, and the teacher just stops, looks at me, and says, "Stop that, there are other people in the room! I think I am going to have to separate you two!" AHHHHHHH. Emily smacked me three times, I was mean to her. We went to Cosi for dinner before the Lax game. Something funny happened, and I howled with laughter, and everybody stared at me. The lax game was really hot. They played a good game, good job girls! That's it, it's hot and I have homework. Ohhh how I long for summer.

      MEN SUCK. Seriously, they should all burn in HELL. I was driving on the freeway, and I had to slow down for a bus, this asshole behind me, riding my ass, had to get into the other lane to avoid hitting me. So when he passes, I see another middle-age man in the passenger seat. I start yelling and throwing my hands up and he glares. Then he sticks out his middle and pointer finger and does this flick-me-off type of gesture. EWWW can I just tell you that boys insurance used to be a lot higher than girls, because THEY ARE BAD DRIVERS! But, to be fair, they now made it equal. Oh it makes my blood boil!! Here are a few statistics I found:  "The male fatal crash involvement rate per 100,000 population was 3 times as high as for female drivers in 1994. Female drivers continue to exhibit safer driving statistics than male drivers. Males accounted for 67 percent of total fatalities, 68 percent of all pedestrian fatalities, and 86 percent of all pedalcyclist fatalities in 1994. 22 percent of male drivers involved in fatal crashes were intoxicated compared to 11 percent of female drivers. 37 percent of female drivers involved in fatal crashes were unrestrained at the time of the crash compared to 47 percent for male drivers involved in fatal crashes." (http://www.familycar.com/Driving/women.htm)   Overall, young drivers, and especially, young White males account for a large share of the alcohol-crash problem. (NHTSA, 2001) (http://www.madd.org/stats/0,1056,4648,00.html)  According to Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, women are less likely to be driving at night, to be driving impaired by alcohol, to be doing other things that are precursors to rollovers. It's statistically provable and very gender-specific. - (USA Today, 2001)(http://4wheeldrive.about.com/cs/forwomenonly/a/aa092202b_3.htm) GRRRR....BOYS SHOULD DIE. Anyways, Harry and Hermione were on TRL. She's really obnoxious. I'm really tired after today. The curve on the math exam was good. My resume looks like shit. Flag football was really hot today. I smell. Dancing was crazy... hip hop? How about some good, clean Indian dance?! AiLy drew a flower on my arm, and every time I see it out of the corner of my eye, I think it's a tattoo!! AHH! That's all, bye.

      I babysat last night. Can I just say that Britney Spears has corrupted the children of America. These little girls pulled out their pom poms and began chanting: "Go bucks! You're so cute, you rock my world!" HI, THEY'RE 8! Anyways, after that disgusting show, we watched a movie and then they went to bed. I came downstairs to get my flip flops and I could only find one. I got on my hands and knees, but the other one was gone! Then I found it... the dog completely chewed and destroyed it. AHH. The dad gave me a pair of his, yeah that'll do a lot of good. I babysat this morning with Veda. Veda has been to Estonia, I mean who at this age has been to Estonia?! She is going to China next spring break with her traveling violin group. That's crazy. But again, she asked me how much hair I cut off then proceeded to go on and on about how she always tells her friends to NOT cut their hair. Veda, what are you trying to prove here?  I just got off the phone with my aunt, it was a great conversation: Aunt Sharon: "I just got off the phone with Sally and I told her about your trip to Indianapolis last week. She thinks your crazy." Me: "If you think that's bad, just guess what I'm doing next." Aunt Sharon: "Oh god where are you going now? Kentucky?" Me: "Nope, further." Aunt Sharon: "Florida?!" Me: "No, try Southwest." Aunt Sharon: "What's it start with?" Me: "T" Aunt Sharon: "Let's see, Tennessee? No, that's not Southwest, wait, no, not Texas..." Me:  breaks out into extreme hysterics  "YES!" AHH my aunt started FREAKING out. She was going on and on about how she is going to come down here and meet Anna, who I'm going with, and all that. Nobody thinks I can do anything! Well, I will show them... when I come home knocked up with Ace's baby! WHAHAH just kidding.

      I definitely skipped school on Friday. There was just no point in going. I ran errands that day. It was so funny, I packed up at least 50 CD's of my entire childhood! I was giving up my NSYNC, Hanson, even my Robyn CD. I went to CD Warehouse to try and sell them. Long story short, they only took 3 and I only got $5.50! AHH ALL THAT WORK FOR NOTHING! Then I called Flannagan's that night to ask about MBR tickets. The guy picked up the phone and I started to say hello and ask my question at the same time so I said, "WHAHAKJBAJEK" literally that's what came out of my mouth. I started laughing, but he made no reaction. Last night the weather was crazy! Liz and the leaders and I were going to go see Shrek 2. But Liz couldn't come, and that sucked, but I still went cause I was all dressed. We were supposed to meet in the lobby of Lennox at 7:20. Around 7:35 I called Margaret to see where she was. Well, because of the Shania concert, she was stuck on 315 but was sure she'd be there in like 10 minutes. Well they showed up around 8:25. It was so funny, I waited in the lobby for an hour by myself! People thought I was stood up, it was great. The "pretty" freshman all saw. AHH there were tons of CSG people there. I was talking to Ann on the phone and she told me it was the Shania concert holding everything up, and I screamed "Shania is playing tonight?!" and everybody turned and stared in judgment. When they finally arrived, I saw Ann throw herself out the window waving as Margaret drove by the theater. Crazy. The movie was really funny. We saw a Harry Potter preview and screamed. I'm so excited for June 3!

      I forgot the funniest story!  Xena: "You guys, I did really bad on my verbal SAT." Me: "Xena, come on, you came all the way over here from China at like 16, I think you took the biggest risk, don't worry about it. I think you're the shit."  Xena stares at me very puzzled and confused.  Me: "Xu, translate." Xu: "She doesn't mean you are literally poop. It's a good thing!"

      May program is getting old real fast. Yesterday, though, I randomly open a locker and it was full of mountain dew bottles. Dude, it's CSG, what can you say? Anyways, I noticed Sally's was next to it and I asked her whose locker it was. She goes, "H, I, J, K... Yeah I don't know" Then she opens it up and is like "OH I thought you meant beer bottles!" Then she takes out a book sox from her locker, opens it, puts the book sox on her head, hold the wrapper up to my face and says, "This is hazardous to children!" It was so funny!  Flag football was freaking crazy today. I was bad, I always am, but today especially. I was hiking the ball to the QB, but Pryor was there, so I didn't know who I was hiking it to, and I hit him with the ball smack in his face! It was so funny! Ann threw the ball and I was walking back to the line, and it completely hit me in the shoulder. Thanks.. I like you too. Hart clogger kept running into me and he was so damn sweaty, it was foul. It was also funny, cause Pryor got the ball, and Hart clooger goes to two-hand touch him, but leaps in the air and lands on him, it was crazy. And Pryor's razor burn is back in full action. Ann was trying to sing "Miss Susie" and she completely butchered the song. She sings, "The boys are in the bathroom kissing the flies are in the warehouse and it's D-A-R-K!" It was really funny, Megan fell on the ground laughing.  Dancing was great. Liz was my partner, but I am more manly than she can dream of being. But she's taller, so I just can't be the guy! We moved towards the leaders and crazyness unfolded. The dancing was really hard. But it was funny.  After school we Ace stalked. He's from Hammonton, NJ, that's 8 hours from here. Road trip anyone?

      Yesterday I was blocking some sophmore in Flag Football, but she wasn't on her side. I kept trying to think of some nice way to put it, but I blurt out, "Maybe you should try getting on your own side!" Ahh, I didn't want to mean, but that's what came out. Great times.  May program is getting old real fast. We played Ultimate Frisbee and it got INTENSE. Hart clogger is just so damn aggressive and obnoxious. I was on the team with the leaders. Ann said, very viciously, "I think I'm going to bite Allison." I turned to her and was like, "HI." And she didn't see me, well it was funny then. Pryor made his team win, it was annoying. That's it, I'm really bored now. I smell.

      Ewww I'm pissed. I picked a new template (do you like it, it's polka dots!) but it deleted all my comments. Well, apparently they're still there but you have to pull these freaky magic tricks to get them to work, and I'm computer illiterate so I don't know where they are. If you want to try and help, I'd appreciate it. Anyways... today was pretty funny. Heywood is crazy in class and gives us tons of homework. Dodie doesn't give his class anything! Flag football was fun. I wore really manly shorts, and want to wear them the rest of the time, it makes me feel bad ass. I was throwing with Blaire and Sarah Bloom, and I told them how I was convinced that I was a hermaphrodite at birth, they laughed. Blaire said everybody starts out as a boy, do you think that's true? Pryor complained about his razor burn again today. My team won, woo no thanks to me! Pryor made me do the kick off, but I was really scared. It was slippery and bad outside, so I ran towards the ball, completely missed it and fell flat on my face! It was priceless! Then I hit it, but Ann was mean to me and told me I wasn't a threat anymore. FINE! Hartshorne is so aggressive. He completely knocked Blaire straight towards the ground. He was blocking me and I got pissed, so I started to beat him up and then he yelled. Pryor pulled up his shirt one time too, it was gross. Then I was talking to Doden, who crossed the field, and I asked to see inside his satchel, and he starts screaming and yelling, "You want to PEE inside my satchel?!" NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID! We had to discuss honor 7th and 8th, boo boring. Trisha and I were flicking around a piece of paper, and I flicked it and it flew off and hit ZAZU! It was so funny. Well I'm done with this. Bye.

      I forgot something really funny that happened at the blink concert. I brought some sharpies to get stuff signed. I gave one to Chelsea and Erica when we were trying to talk to Pete. But that's when TBS came on and I sprinted away. Later I asked for them back and Erica had lost hers. At Stake n Shake I brought up the fact that Erica lost my sharpie, and to defend herself she yells, "Yeah, well Chelsea dropped hers in the toilet!" WHAT?!?!?! Yes, Chelsea dropped my sharpie in her piss and then wiped it off and gave it back. Thanks, I appreciate that.

      May program sucks, it always does. SAT Math, College and Essay Writing...boo! But in College and Essay Writing, Heywood had us write about food we really like. Madeline goes on and on about her favorite ice cream, she had so much to tell, Heywood was like, "You should just write an essay on that!" It was so funny! Everybody had these really good dishes, and then it was Allison Elia's turn and she goes, "Um.. mine comes from a box!" It was just so funny! When we were getting ready for flag football, Ann threw something at my head. I didn't even try and block it, it just smacked me in the middle of my face, oh yeah and by the way it was a pad. I am really bad at football, but I did catch the ball twice, it was exciting. We watched  The Emperor's Club  7th and 8th to prepare for our upcoming exciting discussions of honor. EC sat next to me, we laughed a lot. Then she goes, "I don't like my brown kids white-washed!" It was sooo funny! D Pak is so hot. Well that's about it. P.S. Thanks to Trisha for reading my entire blog entry from the weekend, I know it was hard to read it all.... thanks buddy!

      When Elizabeth and I were picking up our photos, we were driving around the parking lot looking for a place to park. We see someone pulling out, but all of a sudden they hit this cart from out of nowhere! They get around it, but the cart starts coming close to us. But it was in a straight line, I thought it was fine. All of a sudden it sees us and starts heading straight for the car! There was no time to pull in front of it, so instead of just stopping the car and getting out to push it away, Elizabeth starts backing up and screaming, "GET AWAY!" It was so funny. This cart was evil! It finally moved on and went flying across the parking lot. There weren't many people parked out there, and yet it managed to run into one of the few cars. It was crazy.

      AHHHHHHH I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT! BLINK 1 FREAKING 82!!!! I'm sorry, but it was AMAZING. Anyways, I woke up Friday morning after having the most disturbing dream! My aunt had these chicken eggs that she was trying to hatch, but she kept them in the fridge. I went to check on them and they were hatching. One turned into a mouse. It was the size of a rat, but it was a mouse. Then it got in a fight with my cat. The second egg turned out to be a duck. The third was actually a chick, it was really cute, but I picked it up in my left hand, and grabbed a fork in my right, and started to eat it! I ate a living chick! It was horrible! Then I went to Elizabeth's house to get ready for BLINK ME BABY! We went to go get some sneakers and the guy working was so adorable. He looked like an Andrew/Brian from J Rev guy. I had a gift certificate, and he used it and then I asked how much I needed to pay for the balance, and he was like, "$40.42" and I said, "No, but how much after using the gift certificate?" And he goes, "OHH I wasn't thinking! $3.14!" It was great. I also bought some Harry Potter trading cards. SO EXCITING! We went to Germain at like 3:30, but they wouldn't let us in! People just started parking their cars in front of the line and then everybody was partying it up. People played music and it was crazy. We could hear Blink doing their soundcheck, Tom sounded like shit. I danced in the sunshine to their music, AHH I LIVE AND BREATHE TOM DELONGE! I did something and Elizabeth goes, "You're deaf AND blind!" And at the exact same time we go, "HELEN KELLER!" It was great.  They let us park and then people sprinted to the gate. We saw Patrick from Fall Out Boy with his... GIRLFRIEND! AHH NO! She aws pretty and cool, but she had to wait in line with everybody else, poor kid, no backstage pass for her. Elizabeth and I wanted to sneak a camera in. We come up with this idea to wrap it around Lizzie's ankle. But we get in line and we haven't done it. So I go to a corner and tie it aroud my ankle. It looked bad and everybody around was like, "Yeah they're gonna frisk you there." So this girl tells me to put it in my bra like she did. See, she had a disposable and Lizzie's is this big awesome zoom mother. Putting it right between the boobs (ps this is going to be a bit graphic)didn't work, you could see the buldge. So she tells me to put it under one of my boob. AWKWARD! So these girls all huddle around me so I can physically lift my boob up to slip the camera under. People were watching, it was fine. The girl coms to frisk the people, but she only did the guys. I felt really bad, cause she was pretty, and all the guys were like, "OOH watch the goods" and other stupid guy stuff. I would have grabbed it and been like, "Watch the good? This stuff should be on clearance, baby!" I don't know, I thought that was funny. She looked in my bag and I was pulling stuff out but it was really difficult, so I was screaming "I'm sorry, I'm just a groupie!" Crazy. We ran to the FOB stage. The girls who helped me put my camera in my boob were crazy. Any time one of the girls talked to you, she'd grab your boob, it was crazy. There were these weird kids all wearing white t-shirts with a green heart in the middle of a recycle sign, it was odd. They stood on each other's shoulders and stole guitar picks from the stage. I didn't get one, but more on that later. FOB was good. It got wild and I was pushed to the side. But they did a good job. After, we ran into Eri and Chels... LOVE THOSE GIRLS! We all went to see Pete, right when I got up there I heard Taking Back Sunday come on, I shouted right in his face, "I NEED TO GO!" He was just like, "I'll be out here, come back later!" Lizzie and I sprinted, SPRINTED up the hill trying to get to our seats, it was crazy. Nobody was excited for TBS, but we were FREAKING out. I love them! Then we went and talked to Joe from FOB. This guy was taking a picture for us, and he asked how we got the camera, and Lizzie was like "Oh she had that in her boob!" Hi, Joe, nice to see you again. NO, it was really funny. Then we talked to Patrick, ahh he was really nice this time. During TBS I saw a guitar pick fall and I pushed Lizze to get it. She got two picks at our last concert as well, I have ZERO. So to Patrick I said, "Hi, she always gets a guitar pick, but I never do, do you have any?" And he pulls one out of his pocket and told me it was his last one and gave it to me! It was so great. Then I held my fist in the air and grunted, he tried to do it to and said, "I really want to be able to make that noise" and I did it again, oh we are friends. Then we met TBS, I slapped hands with them all, Adam is dreamy (ahh it's like my BSB days, NICK CARTER!). Then we saw Cypress Hill, what the HELL were they doing there? They had an inflatable Buddha holding marijuana on stage. The lit a bong on stage, it was just funny and bad. Blink... where do I even begin? GREAT. Well, they didn't talk/be funny a lot. They could have, and they only played for like a hour, IF THAT! My mom thought that was bs, she was like, "They should have played 2 hours!" And I agree. We took pictures when the mean security guard left and the cool one came. Liz was up in their grill. One time I just ran over to the cool security guard and screamed, "I LOVE YOU, I'M JUST SO EXCITED!" He laughed. I would jump into the aisle and sing and dance, I swear Tom laughed, and don't you try and make me believe he didn't, I'M FUNNY, WE ALL KNOW, AND HE WANTS ME, IT'S FINE. HAHAHA! During the show they suddenly wheeled Travis off, cause his leg is broken, and he appeared from the ground between the two parts of the pavilion, it was amazing. They are brilliant. After the show we saw people standing trying to see them, so we joined. I asked the security guard if there was a chance to see them, she said no, then we talked about how they cannot meet the bands or anything, I said, "Your job sucks!" and she screams, "NO MY JOB IS AWESOME!" Alright, calm down. We went to Steak n Shake it was good. Fun was had. Yesterday I went to see Mae in Indianapolis with Anna, oh god it was crazy. We get there and I called my mom to tell her we were there, I told her the time too, Anna's car said 5:45. Then I hung up my phone and my cell says 4:45, I got really confused. Anna and I were so freaked out and confused, I mean who would have thought that there is a time change when you go to Indiana, NOT ME! It was so funny. We had to wait in line for like 2 hours with the WEIRDEDST people ever. This kid, Joey, was on something STRONG. People were smoking like crazy, too.  The first band was good, the second band, Project Bottlecap, was weird. This really big guy had the girliest voice ever. He convulsed every time he moved as well. The Working Title is really googd. Anna really likes them, and didn't know they were coming, so it was a big surprise. The lead singer is dumber than shit though. During Mae they brought out cupcakes, couple of the guys were celebrating their b-days, and he lit one and started walking over to give it to the guy, but he was like fighting the air so they wouldn't blow out, oh it was hilarious. Mae was good, I couldn't remember any of the words though. Anna is TIGHT with all of the, they remembered her and were hugging her. I was secretly jealous! They were nice and we talked for a long time. Then we drove home, got in around 4, CRAZY! I can't blog anymore or I will go crazy. Sorry this was long, I'm out, bye!

      I just remembered a really funny story from a long time ago. This little girl used to come over and I would babysit her. We were playing in the living room when my neighbor knocked on the door, Bob, yeah the thong guy. Anyways, he told me that his wife, Joan, had died from altzimers. It was really sad and then my mom came down. And I told her Joan died, and she said, "Oh Bob, I'm so sorry, you had to put her down didn't you?" And I started screaming, "NO MOM, not the dog, his wife!" And Bob said, "Yeah, not my dog, my wife!" It was so sad but really funny. Thought I'd share that.   5 hours...23 minutes...14 seconds til BLINK!

      This is really funny. It's an e-mail to my mom from her friend Pattie:  I will be home by 6.  Yes, let’s watch Frasier.  I think I might cry.    Kitty is still in hospital.  I went to visit him before work today.  I hope he can come home tonight after work, but the vet has to see him first.  I suspect it will more likely be tomorrow, but I’m hopeful.  He is a mess; he is wearing one of those big collars to prevent licking his penis where the catheter is hooked.  His entire back area is drenched with urine because it is an open catheter so when the urine comes out it just leaks everywhere.  He was trying to groom himself this morning once the collar came off so he could eat, but it was too big of a job.  He just kept growling.  What time will you be over?  OHH WASN'T THAT FUNNY?! Anyways, I was watching A Baby Story to pass the time. AHH I know, but there was nothing else on. It was just really funny. The girl was from England and she married this New York actor. Her parents came to visit and they could have been her great-grandparents, there were so damn old. They weren't going to tell anybody the name of their kid until he was born, so it was a big secret. First off, she had a C section. Her husband walks out afterwards and is like "That was awesome!" Dude, they just slit a whole right through her stomach and out popped a kid, no, that's not awesome, that's freaky barbarian stuff. Birth really creeps me out. Guess what they named him? RIVER, I know, what is that?!

      IT'S DONE, IT'S DONE, IT'S DONE! JUNIOR YEAR IS OVER, well almost. So close I can taste it! Today I had my USH exam, it was alright. After I went to lunch with Ariel and then to get my brows done. I know, completely superficial, but we've been through this, I'm Indian, I'm excessively hairy, it's okay. I told Erica once, "Yes, I can get tanner than you a lot faster, but you have the normal amount of body hair. It's a trade off!" Anyways, I'm sitting there waiting for Phyllis. She comes out with this other woman and they've both been crying! Then I go lie on the table. There is this blonde girl observing. No, I don't want some blonde to watch me get my hair ripped off six times cause I'm the freaking Bearded Woman. Whenever Phyllis is emotional, she takes it out on your face, beware. The wax was SCOLDING. It was so damn hot. She lays it on me and pokes me with the stick repeatedly. Then she rips it down the center, and it catches some on the side, and literally pulls out 10 eyelashes. Then some wax gets in my hair, she starts pulling at it, and I was screaming, "NO, it's fine, I'll get it later!" Man she ripped it off so fast and was rambling on. I thought I was going to cry. It still hurts. I am burned. I have nothing to do, I mean I could do stuff, but nothing is due tomorrow. This is crazy! AHH BLINK TOMORROW! Okay, let's face it, quizilla is right. I listen to "pop punk". I do, I admit it, it's fine. Stop judging me. Stop right now. I like blink 182, I do. They're a good time. There is nothing wrong with that, so there!

      I can't focus, I'm just so tired. I closed my eyes at 5:45, dude it's 6:30, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? This morning I was driving down Broad Street. All of a sudden I see some kid in the middle of Broad Street, riding on a scooter right on the double yellow line, fool! YOU ARE GOING TO GET RUN OVER, that would suck. I got to school early so Xu could copy some of my notes. I partied it up in the L.I.B. with Xu, Marcoux, AG, Shaunda, and ECBC. It was such good times. I kept laughing about the Less Than Jake concert with Marcoux. See, we both knew we were going to be there, but we never found each other. Cell phones didn't work inside the club, either. So I go outside, see that she called, and then try to call her back. I start to leave a message about who knows what, then I don't know what to say, so I said, "And I want you to know, I love you very much!" I HAD NO WORDS, THAT'S WHAT I SAID! I wasn't high/drunk either, shit man, I know that's what you were thinking. I really just said that, it's only funny cause I don't know Olivia that well, but we're working on it. EC said something so funny, but I can't remember it now. What was it? My mind is completely GONE, it's sad. The English exam was aight. Then I went to study with Chels and Kristen. GOOD TIMES. We didn't study though, literally we studied for 10 minutes. Chelsea fed us these microwavable White Castle burgers, they weren't as bad as I would have guessed actually. Then we had to go to the library so Chelsea could copy Kristen's notes before she had to go home. Kaddy drove. They told me funny stories, it was great. On the way back, it had started to rain, we had to run to the car. We got in and Kristen says, "It smells like wet dog." Chelsea cooly replies, "Katherine." OOOH It was hilarious! Those kids are awesome. Then Chelsea and I had this really long conversation about bras and Victoria's Secret. She just doesn't understand, it's not easy or enjoyable to be bra shopping for me. I explained to her about, "The thick bra straps that literally fall off your shoulder they're so wide and the 15 clasps up the back!" IT was great! Good times. I went on a walk with my mom and the dog today. Family-it's so messed up. My mom has like a crick in her back and can't make turns and stuff. So the dog, right before we get home, stops in front of this house with people on the porch, and starts to take a shit. Dog, I hate you! I yelled at him and told him he was bad. He bowed his head in shame, everybody watched him. Then my mom is walking back with his bag of shit in one hand, not turning any part of her body cause of her crick, oh I wish you had been there. I'm so tired. I REALLY need to study for USH, I want to make Mr. O proud!

      Today was really painful. I was taking a drink from my water bottle and opening my car door at the same time, the door hit the bottle and water sprayed all over my face. On my way to school I stopped really suddenly, cause I was driving too fast, and all of a sudden I feel something slam against my back. Okay, I was driving so fast and had to stop so suddenly, that my bookbag with EVERY BOOK AND BINDER rolled and slammed against my seat! Yeah, that's some bad driving.  The Chemistry exam?! Excuse my language, but WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! Shitter... Doc I really think you gave us all the wrong test. At the end I started to whimper, Trisha saw it, ask her. We were all completely SHOCKED it was so bad. Hardest exam I have ever taken! Math was okay but still bad. I studied for English with Chelsea, Kristen, and Olivia after school. Good times were had. We were talking about  Beloved , and Kristen says, "Yeah, well all black people look the same" DIRECTLY TO OLIVIA! Oh we laughed! Olivia kept pretending her pen was a cigarette, and she kept puffing on it, literally for 10 minutes. I called Jessica Edison to see if Language was the first exam tomorrow, being that she's a genius, and she didn't know, and then Olivia called her after me, and Jessica said, "That's funny, Allison JUST called me!" Studying is so crazy when you do it in groups! Remember, Chels, "I'm looking for a guy with a two-syllable name!"  OOOH crazy. I saw a guy get handcuffed in the middle of the road today, it was sweet. But I also ran over something, I think I popped my tire, damnit, that's the last thing I need right now. I came home, and I was stepping up, but I only did it with my toes and then I fell. I'm in a lot of pain. Well I'm out, I leave you with this:  ValkyrieKaelia13: i was like "whatchoo smokin foo??"  browntrash182: browntrash, browntrash182: see i think that's funny browntrash182: i also wish my blog was famous e c 2 4 4 2: It totally is browntrash182: no like worldwide e c 2 4 4 2: Someone was talking about how much they liked it... I don't know... And then I read it and I laughed browntrash182: i wish my blog was as famous as britney's spears pleather pants with panties over them

      READING DAY... from hell! KIDDING! But today was literally "Make Fun of Allison Day". Let's begin: I was frazzled this morning. I left around 8 for school. I was planning on getting gas this afternoon, I drove past the gas station and noticed a fair price, then right as I passed, my gas light goes on. So I pull over at the next station... and it was more expensive. Then the only pump that I could pull up to, had another car at the pump next to it. The truck was pulled really far up, so my front bumper was by the actual gas pump. I try to pump, but you had to pre-pay. Start to pump and finish, put the cap back on, close up the thing, go to put the pump back on the hook, realize it was only at $14.81 instead of $15. I don't go re-open the gas tank, I just drove off, giving the gas station $.19 of my own money. Damn you.  Then I get to school and park poorly. Elizabeth Chinn told me she was breaking up with me because we didn't tell her we weren't eating at the Spaghetti Warehouse after working at the shelter. That was sad. I felt bad. I went to the dining room, that's where it all began. I was telling some girls that I had to go get my jeans hemmed after school, cause I'm short and it's bad. Alana asked where I got them and I told her Express, and she said, "You can fit into those?" AHHHHHH! She was like, "NO you know I just mean that, because Express doesn't cater to curvy girls!" It was so funny. Then Trisha was telling me about all the fun they had at Ann's and Ann's brother and ya di ya da and all those good times... and I said, "Yeah I read about it on somebody's blog. By the way, I wasn't invited." And Trisha said, "Oh, no offense!" I think you had to be there, cause it really was funny. Katie was talking about somebody, and I said, "Uh... she's right behind you!" SHE WASN'T, BUT IT WAS SUCH A CRUEL TRICK! Sorry about that. I tried to study in the day, it didn't work. I went to Chemistry fourth period. I was telling Doc about how I'm trying to get a job at PromoWest, because I like bands and am interested in entertainment management. Doc said, "You want to be a groupie and sleep with all the bands?!" DOC, EXCUSE YOU! It was great! I went to Cosi for lunch. When I was leaving I got some more ice for my juice, turned around, and then turned back around to say something, and all of a sudden there was a boy there! I screamed and got really scared. I watched Meghan's history presentation after lunch. It was great! Mr. O and I yelled at each other a lot. We were arguing about men and how stupid and bad they are. It was priceless. I ran errands after school. I'm so tired, guys what am I going to do? I'm not studying, help me PLEASE!

      My life is...incredibly random! So blogger made a new design and I was looking at the "Blogs We've Noticed". I do that a lot, that's how I found the one about hating Kerry. Anyways, I see this one called "Life at TJ's Place" I chuckled to myself, TJ's isn't that where Becca worked? I don't know, so I click it. So... TJ's is a STRIP JOINT and the guys is a DJ that works there. Yes, I am thinking "good ol' home cookin" and it's really " good ol' skank strippin". Well that's my luck for you.  Anyways, I went to work at the homeless shelter to help serve food tonight. We met at the Spaghetti Warehouse. Then Dr. Leahy is like "Get in my car, I'll drive you over there". There were 6 of us. Olivia and Rebey (Rebecca) get in and Libby and I were going to, and Leahy starts to drive away! AHH STOP COME BACK! So Lib sits in my lap (LIBBY I AM MENTIONING YOU, THEREFORE,  YOU READ MY BLOG !) and we start driving to the shelter. Leahy wants to turn around, and literally starts to make a U-y (u-turn) in the middle of the road WITH A CAR COMING! She sees it and yells, "CHRIST!" ooh it was so funny! Did you know Naus has a son who looks just like Harry Potter, well she does! And he came and they were both wearing khakis and a white polo. It was adorable! I love that woman! So then we served up some grub and it was a good time. Libs, Rebey, and I worked the milk table. But then this guy came over and was like, "What's the milk" I was really confused, he kept yelling it, and so I grabbed the milk and showed him. He didn't like it, cause it was Giant Eagle brand. Then we started talking about Big Bear and their good milk, I miss the bear. Anyways, I'm LITERALLY not studying. I just can't. I am emotionally DRAAAAAAAAAINED. I'll probably go read random people's blogs, cause I just don't care anymore. BYE!

      I was at Home Depot looking at flowers with my mom. I kept saying that I like the Tiger Lilies and flowers like that. My mom said, "You like all those exotic flowers that are hard to grow!" (and she always says I look exotic) So I replied, "Exotic and rare, like my ass hair." WE BOTH LAUGHED REALLY HARD. Well, I thought that was funny, so I shared it. Now I am going to go feed homeless at the shelter with LEAHY! Leahy rules! I'm not studying! BYE BYE!

      I babysat last night, where do I begin? I don't think I told you about the family I've been babysitting for recently. Another family I babysit for passed my name along. A couple of weeks ago, I was talking to the mother on the phone. Once we set up a couple of dates, she says, "Now, I don't want you to get scared or anything, I mean we are really normal, don't worry, it's fine, but we have a 19 year old girl living in our attic. Now, she can't be trusted with the children, but she'll probably just stay in her room and listen to music, so don't worry." WHAT?! Okay, so last Satruday, she wasn't there. But yesterday... we meet the girl in the attic. I was playing outside with the kids (by the way they are super obnoxious!) and we come inside, and I see this person on the couch. I say hi and then rush the kids upstairs to take their baths. When we came down, she was gone. Then I put the kids to bed and went downstairs. About five minutes later  I hear, "Did I sleep?" I DON'T KNOW! So I said I thought she had and she comes over. Girl has got some dreds. White girl with dreds. Now, you have to understand, this family lives in a huge house in Bexley and their two kids go to Columbus Academy. They have like an Audi, BMW, and a minivan. They're rich. And their cousin is very opposite of this family. That's fine, it was just well... let me go on. She asks me if I'm in school, and I tell her that I'm still in high school and go to CSG. Then we talk about boys and single-sex education, etc. She wanted to look at my books. I had all my English texts we need for the exam, so I show them all to her. She had never heard of  Beloved ,  The Feminine Mystique , or  The Great Gatsby . Okay, how can you be in college, even if you dropped out, and NOT know those books?! Then she goes, "Yeah I dropped out of school" and then she asks me where I want to go to college, and I tell her that I want to be in NYC, and she used to work there. Then we start talking about how Columbus doesn't exactly have the night life scene as NYC. I don't know how, but somehow we start talking about drugs. I go on saying, "Well, yeah there are a lot of parties in Bexley with drugs and drinking. You can find it" and then she asks if other people are involved and I said, "Well, I mean it's not like every single Bexley boy is growing weed in their back yard, so yeah they can get it from someone else. Plus, this is the eastside, there's marijuana growing everywhere!" Then she was like making me explain to her how to get to the eastside, aka she wants drugs. I don't know, then she asked me if I knew any 18 or 19 year olds, which I don't. Then she gets up to leave and says, "Don't do drugs HAHAHAHAHA!" AHH I WAS SO SCARED! When I was leaving their house, I saw all these kids getting out of their cars and going into some house. I was like PARTY! I literally almost pulled over my car and went in. I mean, I was wearing an old t-shirt, velour pants, and these pink, orange, and yellow flowered flip-flops, I was lookin hot, so I really almost crashed the par-tay! But then I was too tired and went home.  I babysat this morning. Aiden came in. I asked him how he was doing and he said, "Fine, well I've been bad for the past two years. And my allergies are taking over" WHAT KID SAYS THAT?! He's really funny. I think that's about it. BYE!

      I took my mom to the Zoo today for her Mother's Day Present. It was really hot outside! We were buying something, and this guy tried to get in our line, and my mom shouts at him: "Hey the line is behind here, buddy!" SEE, THAT'S WHERE I GET MY RUDENESS FROM-my mom! We're both the same. Then on our way home, "Hey Ya" comes on the radio, and out of the corner of my eye, I can see my mom shimmying to herself. It was great! I have to babysit tonight, NOOO I'm really tired!!! And when am I going to study for exams? PSSH, I DON'T KNOW!

      I am so pissed. I was just about to blog, and on the side that says "New Blogs Published" or something I see "Kerry Haters". Okay, I don't love John Kerry, but as I've said, ABB-ANYTHING BUT BUSH. So I read it, and it's so obnoxious. So I leave a threatening comment, here it is, beware, it's graphic: YOU SUCK DICK ASSHOLE! WHAT LOSER HAS TIME TO MAKE A BLOG ABOUT HATING JOHN KERRY. WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO FUCKING JACK OFF IN THE CORNER LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO. BUSH IS THE WORST THING TO HAPPEN TO THIS ALREADY SHITTY COUNTRY. GO KERRY AND GO DEMS. I HOPE YOU ROT IN HELL. I don't know what came over me. I mean, it is fine to have your own opinion, but this pissed me off so much. Jesus, who has time to be such a moron?! Anyways, go stalk this loser http://kerryhaters.blogspot.com/.  Besides that, today was the last day of classes. Junior year from hell is finally coming closer to the end. I didn't have a party in any class-that sucked. The school was so quiet since many girls were taking the APUSH test. I went up on stage for announcements, and I see Dr. D and Pryor in the front row. Dr. D waved at me, ahh I was so excited! English was good. We talked and joked. Then we played outside, WITH DR. D! Maria whispered to me, "I wonder what it's like at his house. I bet it's nice. No TV, and everybody just reading a book around the house, sipping lemonade on the porch!" It was so cute! Last math class. Ann and Anna weren't there, which made me really sad! But, I made Rebecca Greenberger sit by me!! AHH I KNOW! Jeanne did too... love those smart sophmores! But I worked problems at the board with Sammy and Nikki. I knew more than I thought I would without studying. USH was good. Chelsea and Kristen showed their presentations. Chem was boring.. Doc didn't let us have any fun. We watched One Fine Day in Spanish, it was boring. Then seventh and eighth I hung out. 7th period, Chelsea and I sat and talked to Señor. It was funny, though. We dogged Chair Nazi and discussed the old computer guy who was fired for screwing a student... yeah we all know! After school I saw  13 Going on 30  with Liz. It was just okay. Then we ate at Max & Erma's.. yummy! First off, we had a reservation for 7. So I go in there, and there was the STUPIDEST GIRL I've ever met working! I said, "Hi, we have a reservation for 7, name is Allison". Okay yes I said "for 7" instead of "at 7" but when she saw that "Allison" said "2" and there were only two people there-come on! So she gets confused and is being really annoying. Like, "Where is everybody?" or something. And I was like "no for 2 people, at 7 o'clock!" And she was like .."Ohh see I didn't know!" YEAH, YOU DIDN'T. So she tells us we're second. Then like 10 people get buzzed up and go in. So I walk up to this other girl, and I ask, "HI, we were told we were second, and so many people have gone in before us." And she looks at the list and says, "I thought I paged you." And she takes the pager and says, "Oh the wrong pager number is down!" Yeah, that blonde hostess messed up BIG! So I said, "Yeah that's pretty bad for her!" Then the blondes sits us down and says, "Sorry, things get hectic" EWW DIE! Our waiter was Mike! He wore a girl's cross! He was really bad actually. At the end, he was giving us our change and we started discussing math. Then he turned over my check and wrote down this difficult equation, since he's a junior in college. It was funny. He told us he needed it for meteorology. And Elizabeth asked, "Meteorology? Like Jym Ganahl!" And he said, "Eww, Jym Ganhal SUCKS!" IT WAS SO FUNNY!!! Now I'm home. I'm really tired!!!! EXAMS NEXT WEEK-AHHH! Good luck!

      SOOO TIRED. I was going to clean up the kitchen and surprise my mom, but... I fell asleep! My nose is all stuffy too. AHH I HATE SCHOOL. Announcements was funny today. Anna was trying to sell her spray tan, and Quiera was like "I'll buy it...in case you guys didn't notice, I'm black!" AHH Olivia N was laughing, which made me laugh. I joked with Dr. D, I hope we're becoming friends. I did well on my math test and that was quite exciting! But... I got a 69 on my chem test! AHH 69! No but with the curve I got an 84 woo hoo! But I think I'm going to do my best in chem this quarter, so I'm proud, considering how bad this quarter has been. People were kind of breaking down today, due to the major stress of this week. I felt really bad, and I didn't know what to say or do! Hey, anybody who's stressed right now, I am here for you! WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS HELL! Our Spanish project was today. We did alright. I noticed lots of things we messed up on, but hopefully they weren't all too noticable. One of our pictures was labled incorrectly, and one slide talked about the character Belisa in the story  Las Medias Rojas , but she was in  Dos Palabras , well you can't win them all! I had to make up my gym class. I went to tennis, and I was actually good! I mean it's really rare that Allison Ansari makes contact with any kind of ball (ps that was supposed to be a little dirty). I went to Old Navy to turn in my application, surprise, they're not hiring. GREAT! Where should I work this summer? Let me know your suggestions. Good Luck to the APUSH girls tomorrow-you will kick ass!

      I FORGOT to tell you! Señora was being really mean to CP and she was venting to me in the computer lab today. She said, "She was obviously dumped by somebody. Or she's dry. I mean get some fucking play and get off our backs!" I was laughing so hard! Well that's it.  Oh, p.s. if I don't like you and you don't like me, DON'T READ MY BLOG, thanks.

      I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. Hi, today was STRESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSFUL. Let's begin. I had to be at school at 7:15 AGAIN today. I took our chem review test they took yesterday. I ended up getting 25 wrong... out of 40. IT'S FINE. English was pretty good. Kristen and Katie presented their projects. Sam compared Allen Ginsberg to Eminem. Yes, it's cause they are exactly the same. As Erica said, "Cause Eminem hates gays and Ginsberg is gay!" RIGHT... actually Sam was nice to me today, and I feel bad cause I say mean things about her sometimes. She's just one of those people you love and hate at the same time. She's nice, but can drive you up the wall. Anyways, we had a math test today. It was our last one, therefore the hardest. It was hard, okay it was just hard. I thought I was going to go crazy in History. It was our last day of notes, thank god, but I just wanted him to be done. I really thought I was going to pull a  Mean Girls  and jump over the table and attack Mr. O like a hyena, or perhaps, a lion? FIND THAT DAMN LION COPS-I MEAN JESUS, IF IT IS REAL, HOW THE HELL CAN YOU NOT FIND A LION? We finally finished our notes, and then I gave my Elvis power point presentation. It went alright. Chem was not any better. My muscles kept tightening. I just couldn't take going over our test, I just wanted to scream, so I shouted "DOC I just can't anymore! My muscles are tightening and I just want to SCREAM. Every period has been awful. I can't concentrate, I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!" After class he started to chase me around the room, threatening to tickle me, which I hate, if I didn't scream and get out my frustration. I did a little, but then ran out the door. Worked on Spanish a bit fifth period and then watched the other group's presentation sixth period. Good job girls! Señora is just awful. We saw her sister yesterday at Academy, and today I told her that. She was like, "OOH we are just so edifferent. I mean they esay that I am the epreppy one. But oh I don't eknow. One day I saw mea sista and she was awearing abrown pants, brown shirt, and a brown sweater. I mean she was alost in the ebrown! When I go to their aparties they just look so eplain. I call up my daughter and esay, 'Did you esee what they were awearing?!'" Yes, these our your sisters, you'd think blood is thicker than fashion, but apparently NOT! If you saw me seventh and eighth periods, then you know my frustrations. I was freaking out! Our Spanish project is just so stressful! We were running back and forth between her room to get things checked and the computer room. ECBC and I were just laughing hysterically, cause we were just that stressed. Señor MADE us come to his room and tell him about the AP test, but I was so stressed by that, he was mean too. DAMN YOU. Every time I'd try and print something, the printer would start printing 1000 pages of something else. I was screaming at it and going crazy in the lab, and I threatened some freshman, oops! I had to leave and go pick up ice cream for tutoring, Liz, Meghan, and Char Char came with me. I was so stressed and was swearing at everybody. They were annoyoed, but I was really CRAZY, and high on the evil Spanish project weed. I don't know, I just made that up. Tutoring was pretty good. I was sticky from all the ice cream. The kids were good, I'll miss some of them. I'm missing Melvin as we speak, I love you Melvin! Well... I think that's all the good times, probably not cause these days are so stressful and just too funny! AHH well I'm out to wash my feet. Adios!

      I feel like I've done two weeks of manual labor-in reality it's only Tuesday. I'm so tired. I've gotten up at 6 the last two days, that's not that early, but it is for me. Today I had the AP Spanish Language Test. It was hard and long. The speaking part was TERRIBLE! It was so bad, we're just not even going to discuss it. Spanish is taking over my life, I'm so sick of it. IT SHOULD DIE. Nothing really funny happened today. Oh, I had to go to B Day's lab today. I was partners with Megan Quinn-that was fun. She was playing with the eyewash and pulled the trigger and it sprayed up, but it was directly under a wooden shelve and the wood got all wet. It was nice, then Doc pulled it out and pretended to spray her and she was running around the room. Then she was going to rub something all over her to turn her skin black, and she was singing around the chemicals, I laughed really hard. Then SAM PARSONS-little brat I am going to kill her-was the curve breaker on our test! I started screaming and Doc got scared. CP locked her keys in her car so we hung out after school. I got home at like 5, better than yesterday, but I'm just so tired. I need ice cream scoopers for the tutoring party tomorrow-if you have any PLEASE BRING THEM! THANKS. Oh ps FOX FOREVER called my house today to discuss the party-it was crazy!  I leave you with:  e c 2 4 4 2: We just use spoons around here for the ice cream e c 2 4 4 2: When there's food in the house, haha

      HELLO! What is up? Today was pretty funny. I got up early to do some last minute review for my chem test (more on that later). Then I went to school and did some more review, etc. Charlotte and Megan K presented in English class. Megan K played some violin to demonstrate a point- it was amazing. Then she had a book of show tunes, I wanted to hear some Aladdin, but Dr. D was all about something else. She had NEVER played it, but tried, and was perfect! It was awesome. Also, she had one of these music stands that folds up and I just really wanted it. We asked her if her poet, Langston Hughes, had any wives or kids. She said no and I said, "Sounds like my life, all alone" or something and only Maria laughed... oh it was great! Ms. King (Julie) baked us cookies for being so nice to her. They were yummy and math class was fun. History was one of the best we've had. First, Mr. O got a haircut and shaved his beard. Everybody was walking down the hall shouting, "Looking good O'Grady!" and "Hot stuff!" and whistling, it was great. Then we were discussing whether or not we should have gone into North Korea. Everybody was shouting out how they felt, and I was changing my decision, and O'G was going on and then he just bursts into "America the Beautiful" and everybody was still shouting. Then we all laughed. Ariel kepts shouting, "I have a question, I have a question!" and Kristen muttered under her breat, "JUST ASK IT!!" I love Kris. Then O'G was explaining CenTO and he says, "Big C, little E, little N, big T and O" and I ask, "Is that a big O?" and he goes, "Yeah, that's a big O" AHH I DIDN'T MEAN IT! We gathered around the chem room at break, our tradition before a test. It was funny, because on Friday I was telling everybody how whenever I go to my dermo I tell him what he wants and he writes me a prescription, well then on Saturday I found out... he died. It was sad, but isn't that weird how I mentioned him on Friday. The chem test was... A JOKE! It was so bad. It was a test unlike any we've had, yeah the last one was completely different. In the middle of the test I shouted out, "Doc, I've made up my own method of science!" The average is like a 54. That's great. I worked on Spanish fifth and sixth periods. Lunch was really awkward. Then I went in to give something to Señora and talk about my grade... I'm seriously getting a C in Spanish, no joke. She says, "Ajorge I do not eknow what the aproblem is. You are usually such a good estudent, but I eknow that you have had amany deaths, and you missed a whole week before the etest. But you know ajorge, I looked at the enational espanish exam and you got a 8%, that's not agood." 8% WHAT THE HELL? So I go to Señor's room, and he was really nice. We looked at my practice AP Spanish Language Exam (taking it tomorrow-wish me luck) and he was like "If you could do well on this, you DEFINITELY didn't get an 8%. You probably messed up the bubbles and screwed it all up." AHH I hope so. It was our last kickboxing, but we walked around the school. I had some nice chats with some folks, especially Margaret. Good luck on the game tonight girls! Then I stayed at school until 5:30 working on our Spanish project-hey group projects SUCK! Kidding, my group is good, I like them! Did I ever tell the story about the people I babysat for on Sat? Well, if I did, don't pay attention. When I was talking to her on the phone, she says, "Now, we are really normal people. I don't want you to be worried or anything, I mean it's fine, but we have a 19 year old girl living in our attic. Now, she can't be trusted around the children, so she'll just stay in her room." OKAY-THAT'S NOT SCARY AT ALL! Thankfully, she was out of town, my god people are weird these days. Well I leave you with this:   ELCB95: back like your mama browntrash182: ahhh you sayin my mamas got a big back? ELCB95: No way beeeeeach ELCB95: I got yo back ELCB95: like a mama got her baby ELCB95: back  ELCB95: ribs ELCB95: err..

      I am in such a pissed off mood right now, thus will blog. My mom is being an A hole. Anyways, it's been awhile since we've talked.  I had school on Friday, therefore it was a bad day. Just kidding! It was pretty good! We watched a documentary about women and their struggle for justice. I loved it, being that I am a feminazi. But, there was this one awful, awful woman. She was almost everything I hate in a person, in one person. She was from Texas, she was stupid, and I just hated her! She goes, "We really had everything, nobody should have complained. We were all happy." BULLSHIT- being a slave to a man is not life! Then they talked about Roe vs. Wade and she says, "I saw it in the paper (tears) and I just couldn't believe it! (Dramatically crying when it is obviously for attention only) I knew I just (can't get the words out cause she's crying so hard) had to do something!" It was so obnoxious. She should go back to Texas with all the other losers from Texas, i.e. BUSH! ABB- Anything But Bush! (p.s. I got the "Rock Against Bush CD" it's good, check it out!) That made me remember when I was in Washington on the march, and I heard this baby crying, and I said to Erica, "That baby is crying for injustice!" We thought it was funny. Anyways, then we had our last actual math class with a lesson. It was kind of sad. I had some good times in that class. Let's reflect. 1. "Karen and I had fun on number 69!"-Ms. Potts 2. Me yelling at Ann to do her math homework every night! 3. Ms. Potts always hating me... "What did you do now, Allison?!" Oh it was just so wonderful! I'll miss it. Spanish is taking over my life. I'm going to do so badly this quarter, really it's not good. Health was awesome! We had pizza and then listened to the drug speaker, Sgt. Powell. Somebody threw a candy at Megan Quinn, and it hit her in the boob! She yelled that it had hit her in the boob, and Ms. Faidiga said, "Maybe it'll swell and you'll have a good weekend!" Can you believe that!? She really said it! I was dying. Then Megan kept drinking Mountain Dew- oh that's not a good thing for her. But no, she was well-behaved. The drug stuff was interesting. After school, I went home with Chels to study for the SAT. But did we study? NO! We went to see Mean Girls. It was really good, I don't regret going! Then we went to the McDonald's drive-thru. When we were ordering, I kept yelling out "YOu have a hot voice!" and other things. HE was so annoyed with us, so we were finishing ordering and he goes "Is that all?  IS THAT ALL? " WE WERE SO SCARED! The food was good. We did come home and study a little. Then Chelsea told me the plan on how to take the test for somebody else and they take it for you... etc. resulting in you getting a really good grade. So I called EC up at like 10:30 and tried to get her into the plan. HAHAHA She said no. I probably wouldn't have done it either. But it was really funny. I ended up spending the night at Chelsea's, so we had to go print our admission tickets out at her mom's. We started watching Dateline about this knocked-up 17 year old. It was awesome. I told Chelsea all my stupid, funny stories, we bonded. Her brother and his friends were being loud that night, damn freshman. It was great. The test was so hard. It should die. Then we went to lunch and it was yummy. This little girl kept sticking her hand in her brother's butt, and only stopped when Chelsea saw her. Then I went to see Envy with Liz, it was so bad don't see it. We hung out until I had to go babysit back in Bexley. They were new, I'd never met them before. The boy was annoying. He was better at everything than me. Plus he would not let me help him when he was taking a bath. I said, "Well I won't come in, I'll just be out here in your room." He replied, "No you won't. You'll be out there and my door will be shut." Okay, fine. They were okay, I got like $50 for 4.5 hours. It was sweet. I babysat AGAIN this morning. AHH KIDS SHOULD DIE! Sofia, a little girl, never ever speaks, but today she wouldn't shut up! Then all of these kids just barged in and were being really bad. It was sad, they were really in-bred. I wanted to go to the Allister show tonight with Anna, but my mom is being an ass wipe and an evil dictator. So I'm not studying for chem right now, oops oh well. Just another bad grade to add to... JUNIOR YEAR FROM HELL!

      Rain makes me angry. That is the title of this entry.  I hope I do not forget anything, but alas I know I will. Well, I got home today from Texas. Where should I begin??? This is a crazy adventure, so buckle up, grab some kleenex, and get ready for hot rockstars, baby! Last Tuesday I began this adventure by going to Anna's. We went to Walmart to stock up on supplies (i.e. whipped cream, sex toys, and booze for our rockstar lovers). Anna's dad told us to try and get a key box you put under your car with an extra key in it. We went to the Auto section, but nobody was helping anybody and we couldn't find it ourselves. We asked this guy in the Camping section for some help, and I think he called somebody. It was really funny at the time. We bought some food for the trip. I got these HUMONGOUS, checmical-grown apples and some bologna for sandwiches. We went back to her house, made sandwiches, packed up the cooler, then tried to make brownies. But, her brother had used all the cooking oil in the deep fryer, so we had to pour the mix in a bag. We watched the Drive-Thru records DVD, which is so funny. This guy, R2K, from Finch- so hot and funny. The Early November stuff was really good as well! There is this part where the boys go into this room to meet with these new producers. They get there, and the new producers (blonde ho's) start taking off their clothes and giving them lap dances! Then they are talking about it afterwards and Ace says something like (I couldn't remember, so I asked Anna): yay f0r mae x: he's like, 'i told them to take their clothes off, and they were like, 'what?! why?!" and i said, 'cause that's what publicists DO'. Yeah, I wish I had that DVD, it's off the hook. We also watched their DVD that comes with the CD, it is always a good time. "The CD has 11 songs and is 50 minutes long, that's pretty long for 11 songs" yeah I don't know why that makes me laugh, but it does! We watched some videos on Anna's computer and talked to some folks, then finally went to bed around 2.   Wednesday, June 23, 2004:  6 A.M.: We got up and started to get ready. We packed up all our stuff, put the cooler in the car, and rolled out around 6:30. We stopped and got some Tim Horton's for breakfast, then hit the road flying with excitement! 8 A.M.: The excitement had worn off. Now we were just tired and shit-faced (not really, but I like to say that). We realized that we were IDIOTS for going to bed so late, knowing full well we'd have to arise with the sun and bid farewell to Ohio the next morning. We drove through Cincinnati and into Kentucky without any problems. We saw a watertower that said, "Florence Y'all". Damn hicks.  11 A.M.: We rolled into Tennessee and decided to pull over and stretch a bit. I forget where we were, but we went to this Sam's Sad Clown warehouse type thing. I forget what it was, but it was weird. I walked in and saw a shelf full of Confederate Flag memoralbia. EWW I HATE THE SOUTH!  We continued on the road and saw a speed limit sign saying, "70". At the exact moment we both screamed, "OH MY GOD, THE SPEED LIMIT IS 70!" We listened to some tunes and had some laughs. My phone changed time zones, which was exciting. Anna's doesn't, and I think it upsets her. I get really excited when I see a house on a truck... in one day I saw FIVE! And I saw one on the way home. 4 P.M.: Okay... the car was no longer fun. This was starting to look like a huge mistake! 12 hours of driving in a day- THAT'S CRAZY TALK! We got through Nashville and Memphis, but we were seriously needing Jackson, Mississippi to be the next city. Mississippi was not as bad as I would have thought. It was lush and green and trees grew in the median.  8-9 P.M.: After 12 hours or so in a car, we finally got into Jackson in the evening. Our first Red Roof Inn was okay. We were not very fast at unpacking the car, but we improved our speed over the next few days. I wrote in my journal and listened to music. I think I read a chapter of  Harry Potter  as well. We crashed pretty fast and then woke early for our next day.   Thursday , June 24, 2004:  9 A.M.: We packed up the car again, checked out, and left town for an 8 hour drive to Houston. It was sprinkling. Thus beginning the rain. The rain began to pick up as we neared Louisiana. In fact, as we drove up a bridge, it poured so hard we could not see the road. We couldn't pull over either, because if we went too far, we'd have fallen off a cliff. We pulled over for shelter and gas (and by pulled over, I mean we went onto a different highway, but we figured it out). Anna called the Mae guy to confirm our being on The List, but he didn't answer. He did call back, however, when Anna was peeing. We got gas and sat in the car waiting out the rain. A man came out of his car, wearing a top hat, looked at our license plates and then in at us through the window, and motioned the act of driving with his hands. No no, it was TERRIFYING! We decided that the rain was safer than those crazy-ass people at that sketchy gas station. 5 P.M.: Arrived in Houston, only to learn that their highways are completely FUCKED up. When you pull off, you are on a one-way road and if you want to go the other direction, you have to turn around, and it's so confusing! We passed an Olive Garden and discussed our mutual like for their restaurant. We got to our hotel, after a bit of confusion, and unpacked at quite a fast rate.  6 P.M.: We got a map of the surrounding area and decided to check out North Mall. However, they only had shoe stores and a CD store full of rap. We decided to drive around and get some grub. But five minutes of driving put us like 20 miles away from our hotel. We got back on the freeway and saw the Olive Garden again.. so we went and ate there! It was our date meal.  10 P.M.: I checked in with Elizabeth and caught up. Anna and I were anxiously approcaching the concert the next morning and all the glory it would be. I talked to Erica that night at like midnight. I could hardly sleep that night with anticipation.  Friday, June 25, 2004:  6 A.M.: I woke up with nerves and butterflies in my stomach. I was so worried about something going wrong, and so excited to have so much fun. I couldn't sleep. I listened to the Early November's CD twice and tried to remember the lyrics. 8:45 A.M.: I decided to give up and just take a shower. I got cleaned up and shaved, gotta be ready for my man. I think I woke Anna up, but we needed a lot of time to get ready anyways. It was sprinkling and we were really not wanting it to rain. Warped Tour is rain or shine, but after 20 hours and a state full of rain, we wanted some shine. 10:30 A.M.: We looked hot and rockin', so we left our hotel towards Reliant Stadium for the show. We found this really awesome radio station and were jammin' and getting PUMPED! But then, the DJ starts talking about "Warped Tour NOT being cancelled, it being postponed." I'm sorry... REPEAT. Postponed? You can't cancel/postpone Warped Tour. That's not how it is. We drove towards the stadium anyways, there was no way in hell the show was off. 11 A.M.: The show was off. Postponed 'till Monday. My heart broke. I cried a little. I never cry.  12 P.M.: We left the Red Roof early, packed the car in a record three minutes, and started the drive to Dallas. We were still really upset about Houston. Then we got stuck in traffic. Dead stopped in traffic. The day was sunny. The show would have been fine. It sprinkled on and off again, but nothing we couldn't have handled.  5 P.M.: Arrived in Dallas, after sitting in traffic, and tried to find the ampitheather to get our bearings. Mapquest, however, had led us to train tracks.  6 P.M.: We began to drive around in search of a hotel. Needless to say, there were none. Dallas was holding a convention and everything was booked.  7:30 P.M.: We finally found Smirnoff amphitheater, but there were no hotels around it. 8 P.M.: We went outside of Dallas, found a dumpy Super 6 and settled on a smoking room for $50. The entrance was chained off and it was quite difficult to get inside the parking lot. But it was the best we could get. However, the boy working was hot and Indian. His name was TK and he was a fox! When Anna was paying, I noticed a van with a trailer. Rockstars perhaps? Then I saw some skinny boys! AHH could we be staying with some warped kids?! I asked TK if he saw any skinny boys with piercings. He asked me if they were "white dudes". Then I asked what room, all he told me was, "They're close." TK, YOU TEASE! Close they were, two rooms down in fact.  9 P.M.: We went to Burger King and ran into some guys who worked the Volcom stage. One asked if we were going to Warped, and we told him we were from Ohio, and the other one goes, "Why would you come here all the way from Ohio?" What's it to you, bitch? We didn't come for your ugly ass, hell no.  10 P.M.: We really wanted to hang out with those rockstars. I stuck my head out the door to try and see what they were doing, and at the exact same time the little one walked by, and I screamed. He apologized, then went to do his laundry. We couldn't stand the smell, so we went to play Harry Potter Uno outside. The guys came over and asked if we wanted some alcohol and then started talking. They're from A Thorn For Every Heart or something like that. Anyways, we saw another van with a trailer, and they went over to see who was in it. We tagged along and met the guy from... LYLAH! He was cute and goth! The first group of guys kept talking about how they have a set time everyday and all that, but the Lylah guy was like "Dude, I've done this for three years, there are always problems!" So those other boys left out of embarrassment. We talked to the Lylah guy and his bandmates for like an hour. He kept making jokes about their tour guy's mom-it was funny. They were super nice and were like, "If you want to hang out later, come up to our room!" But we went to bed with anticipation and hopes of no rain for the next day.  Saturday, June 26, 2004:  7 A.M.: The stupid Thorn band was blasting their music while packing up their van, which woke us up. 10 A.M.: Left for the show, got lost a couple of times, then paid $12 to park! WHAT THE FUCK?! 11 A.M.: We were directed to the Trojan booth to wait for The List. Anna saw Dave from Mae, with his girlfriend, and we chatted a bit. I spied Serg walking around (with hot new blonde hair).  12 P.M.: The List comes out... we're not on it. Thus begins the freaking out. We called the Mae guy a thousand times, but he didn't answer. We asked this guy who was running around like crazy, but wearing an All Access pass, to help us out.. he said he would. 12:15 P.M.: Adam, the Mae guy, hooks us up. Since Anna had an interview she got a press and photo badge. They told us we had to go backstage to get in, but we had to wait for a group of other people. I started to get freaked out. I got light-headed and was breathing really heavily. The trip had been so stressful already, I just wanted in the gates. Yes, I had a mini panic attack at Warped tour. I just couldn't take the stress anymore!  12:30 P.M.: The lady walking us back starts talking to this other woman, so we had to wait. Suddenly, I heard Anna say, "ACE!" I turned around... and there he was. The love of my life, with a buzz cut. But, it was the HOTTEST thing ever. He was tan and his jawline was better than ever! He was walking around with Jeff, who also looked mighty fine with spiked hair and a blonde spot on the top of his head. They said hello and stopped to talk to us! Ace grabbed my shoulder and asked me how I was doing. Then he looked at my shirt, an Early November "Hammonton For Life" t-shirt, and then smiled at me. It's hard to explain, but it was like a "thanks for your support, I really appreciate it" kind of smile. (P.S. If he looked at my shirt, he was lookin at my boobs.. gross I know, sorry I stuck that in there). Anna was talking to Ace about something, so I explained our treacherous adventure to Jeff, who dropped his jaw out of astonishment! I was like, "This is all for you, baby!" They said they had to go inside but would talk to us later. We finally got in, but couldn't find the main stages or the band's booths! However, I did find The Matches tent, and I didn't know they were playing! 4:45... I was there, I love them! We talked to the bass player about how much I like them, so that was good. Then it started to pour rain... POUR! Some guy yelled that there was another section. We found Senses Fail performing... and on their last song. DAMNIT. We tried to find the Mae booth, but we couldn't. 1:00 P.M.: Anna went to take pictures during Early November, and I found myself a spot in the crowd. I asked people to move for me, since I'm short. Some guy was like "If you kiss my ass I will" and I said, "I traveled here all the way from Ohio, fuck yeah I'll kiss your ugly ass for a better spot!" Some OBNOXIUOS TEXAN hits my shoulder and points to my John Kerry button and was like, "Not cool" then he makes some gesture I don't get and his Asian ho laughs. So I said, "Well, I AM in Texas, what can I EXPECT from you?! Oh, and by the way, Bush sucks!" FUCKERS. The Early November played so well! They have so much energy and I love their lyrics. It was pouring and I could hardly see through all the crowd surfing. My cartilage piercing was pulled and my head got lodged between a crowd surfer and the barrier for like five seconds. Oh, and somebody fell on my face, not my head, my face. It was painful. My buttons kept coming undone then going straight into my skin. It hurt like a mother. Afterwards we finally found Mae's tent to set up the interview. Then we walked around, I bought the TEN Acoustic CD and a sticker, then we proceeded to see Mae. On the way this kid jumps in front of me and asks me if I was from Jersey (my shirt had a picture of Jersey on it), I told him I was from Ohio, and he goes, "Oh, well I'm from Jersey" and touches my shirt to show me where he lives. By the way, the state so happens to be drawn on my boob. EWW do NOT touch me! Anna stayed in the front to take pictures of Mae the whole time! She even caught Jacob's drumstick-at least something good happened! We talked to John from The Matches as well. He's so funny! Shawn is not very friendly, though. I said, "We saw you guys with FOB" and John was like, "Oh, yeah yeah.". Then I said, "No no, it was with Matchbook Romance!" and he goes, "Oh, yeah yeah.". He was kind of dumb. Anna asked him why they didn't come out after the show, and he goes, "Well we were snorting cocaine in our bus. And by bus, I mean van. And by snorting, I mean drinking water." It was so funny! 3:45 P.M.: We hurried back to see the end of Yellowcard, and by "seeing" I mean just listening to a very bad quality, because you couldn't hear anything. We went back to TEN's tent (by the way, it was bright, neon green and, as Serg put it, looked like, "a huge zit on the top of your nose on the first day of school") to see if they were signing stuff. There was a massive crowd of people, but I saw Anna waving. I jumped up to try and see, and there they were, those eyes. Ace's BEAUTIFUL teal eyes. I was jumping, smiling, and waving, and he smiled back. We got up there and told them good job and all that. Then Ace, Jeff, and Joe signed my Acoustic CD. We talked a little bit and then Ace began to show his muscle. My god, it was HUGE. Some guy took a picture with it. Anna felt it, but I tried to and he wouldn't let me. I was like, "Please, please..." and he kept saying no and shaking his head. Then he pat my head. I feel bad, I was really gross and wet. Anna goes, "She's gonna cry!" and I said, "Hey, we traveled all this way to see you, let me feel your muscle!" and he goes, "Oh, okay!" So I poked it and it was HUGE. We wanted some pictures, so we asked if we could come around and he said yes. We took a couple and talked in between takes. Other fans were getting stuff signed, so we stood behind the boys, and they talked to us in between signing other fan's stuff. We were in there for at least 20 minutes. Let me try and remember some of the good stuff:  Ace: "Hey, who's drumstick is that?!" Anna: "Jacob from Mae's." Allison  to Jeff : "Can I have one of yours?" Jeff: "Sure, hold on...oh but they're all packed in the bus!"  But he was going to give me one.  I was talking to Peaches (the merch guy- not so nice this time either) and trying to buy some stuff. Ace kept putting his hand over my eyes so I couldn't see Peaches, but I kept moving my head to see around his hand and talk to Peaches, but he kept moving his hand with my eyes... num nums.   He was wearing his Epcot hoodie, like always, and I told him I love Epcot and he said he went there in December. I asked his favorite country, and he said Italy. He also said he liked Ohio. And to Joe he goes, "These girls came all the way from Ohio and they're coming back tomorrow!" We weren't, but he's not too bright, so he didn't know. It's okay.  I was digging through my bag looking for something, while I was standing by the boxes of shirts and merch, and Ace turns around and goes, "Are you stealing stuff?!" But it was cute.   I bought a tote of theirs and they all signed it. I asked what he wrote and it said, "Thanks, Ace" and I told him I wanted a note. So he wrote me a note on the back of the bag.  Then later, he looks at me and goes, "Oh, are YOU still here?!" It was funny, though.  He was really sarcastic this time, unlike his usual shyness, but it's not the kind of sarcasm I hate when it's just awkward and you don't know what to say (i.e. Joe from FOB), but he's really just playful and silly.   Jeff was super nice as well. God he's hot. I can't remember all those minutes in the tent, but they were pretty damn good.   We took pictures of Ace's ass.  When we left I ran into this guy who wouldn't let me ditch in front during TEN.  Me: "Oh there's the guy who wouldn't let me stand in front of him during The Early November!" Him: "You wouldn't have let me!"  I go over and stand in front of him  Me: "Do you see how much taller you are than me, you can see over me!"  He starts to shrink down as if he's short and can't see  Then he showed me his autographed Acoustic CD, autographed Senses Fail guitar pic, and all his TBS stuff. We talked a little more. Him:  about TBS  "Yeah, well I had sex with them!" Me: "Yeah, well I had sex with them before you!"  He was funny.  4:30 P.M.: I felt really bad, but I told Anna I had to see The Matches, and she said she could do her Mae interview by herself. So I left and found them. God they were good. I even had a converstion with Shawn from the crowd. He said something about the CD, and I screamed, "I have it!" and he asked who said that, but these girls screamed and I raised my hand and was like, "No... it was me!" then he smiled. They run around a lot when they play, and Shawn ran into John, who looked at him with eyes I've only seen Connie Bowen have when she didn't win every award at US night. Dude... he was pissed. Fortunately, they're playing the whole Warped- so I'll be seeing them again.  5:15 P.M.: I headed back over to the main stage to catch the end of Story of the Year. I looked at some booths by myself then caught Taking Back Sunday at 6. The crowd got pushy and there was an obnoxious girl by me.  6:45 P.M.: I finally found out that Anna was at the SmartPunk stage and caught back up with her. She hadn't done her interview yet, no she had been watching bands with JACOB. I didn't feel bad anymore, since she got to go on a date with her husband, thanks to my needing to see The Matches. We watched Hidden In Plain View, then went back to the Mae tent to do the interview. Then we waited and waited and waited. Finally, Zach goes "Let's just go back to the bus, hopefully Jacob is there!" But I didn't have a pass, so I didn't know if I'd get through. Right as we did get through, however, we saw SERG! I didn't want to go back to the bus anymore, damn Serg is hot as shit. I had been looking for him all day! We got quick pictures, and I asked him to sign my new TEN tote, and he goes, "Oh sure sure, I'll sign it!" But Zack looked like we had to go and he was waiting and I felt bad, so I said I had to go, and Serg was like, "Are you sure, I'll sign it!" It was so weird, he's usually drunk and stoned after shows and is a real jerk, but he was so nice this time! We got on Mae's bus, and Anna tried to do the interview, but her recorder was broken. So we left. Then I saw Jordan Pundik, he's actually a little cuter in person. We waved, but he didn't come over, because as Anna puts it, "It's now their time". It wasn't about us anymore.  9 P.M.: We left for our hotel and crashed, well after driving through traffic to get there.  Sunday, June 27, 2004:  9 A.M.: We got up and left. Now we could pack the car in no time at all. We didn't really talk in the car, the last few days had been crazy and we were mad tired. We did notice that the south names all their places after other foreign countries. Paris Texas, Palestine Texas, Florence Kentucky.. There were some others as well.  5 P.M.: We began to get very slap happy as we neared Nashville. We started talking like gangstas and going crazy. We checked into a really nice hotel, then went to Taco Bell for food. We came home and partied it up in the room by watching  Minority Report . We watched some of  The Secretary  with Maggie Gyllenhal- so fucking weird. Why are those kids always in weird movies? She kept having these freaky images of weird sex things with her boss. So odd.. then she was BUCK NAKED. I wondered if her brother saw it? Eww, I hope not. Anna mentioned that her ribs were sticking out and it looked like another pair of boobs, and I said, "Yeah, it looks like a butterfly!" I think you had to be there. We watched Elimidate til like 2:30 in the morning. Love those sleepovers.  Monday, June 28, 2004:  9:30 A.M.: We were woken by the maid. We decide to head out early and get home.  1 P.M.: We get a few sprinkles (it wouldn't be a day on this trip without rain) and then hit DEAD stopped traffic in Kentucky. We sat there... for an hour. But it was fun. We frolicked in the median and blasted punk music. I went to get a soda out of the cooler, rested it on the car, slammed the trunk, and saw the damage it did to the can. I forgot I had put the can there! I couldn't open it properly. I kicked the mud-flap of this truck, and when I was sitting in the car I heard him growl, "Hey did you kick my mud-flap?" and I said yes, and he growls, "Why'd you do that?" and I replied, "Because I wanted to touch it..." and his ponytail was flying in the wind, it was scary. 7 P.M.: FINALLY we got back to Canal! We dropped our film off at Walmart and then went back to clean her car. We got doubles of the Mae pictures instead of the TEN ones, oops! But they're pretty good and I'm excited to have them! 9 P.M.: My mom and I left for home.  P.S. During the trip we only heard music from these people: Usher, Faith Hill, Hoobastank's "The Reason", Switchfoot's "Meant to Live", and Trapt's "Headstrong". There were some others- damn those tunes got redundant. We also made a list of cities we passed through that celebrities were from. Here it is: Cincinnati-98 degrees Memphis- Elvis and Justin Timberlake Houston- Destiny's Child Dallas- The Simpson sisters Little Rock- Bill Clinton  Overall, the trip was a good time. It was physically and emotionally draining, but the good made it worth it. I will NEVER travel to Texas willingly again. Especially not for a boy, okay maybe for Ace, though most don't think he's that hot, his voice and lyrics and that chiseled jaw make him absolutely BEAUTFUL!   P.P.S. If you thought this was long and hard to read, try sitting here for like three hours writing it. Shut up, you know you enjoyed this. Comment.

      It's so hot right now. Maybe that's because I'm wearing a sweatshirt. Who knows?  Yesterday I went to sleepover at Lizzie's. AHH it was so much fun! Wait, before that I hung out with my mom. I remembered seeing, at Walmart,  Harry Potter  for like 6 bucks. So we went there to buy the fourth one. But those low, low prices made us go crazy and we bought out the whole store! I needed a bunch of stuff for Texas, and my mom ended up getting it along with everything else, that was nice of her. But the store is under construction so the entrance wall is kind of blocked off and there were so many carts, a visible path of entry could not be found! There was a worker standing there, doing absolutely nothing, so I asked her, "Isn't it your job to be friendly?" BEEYATCH. Towards the end, I began to get dizzy and light-headed from too much exposure to those low, low prices. I had to be taken out of the store. My mom and I discussed the Olympic torch. She said it had left California, but I didn't know it traveled across the world. I asked her how it got across the ocean, and she said, "Well, it goes on a boat. But they have to keep running in place." GO MOM! We went to this pet place and played with kitties. They were so cute! Then I went to Elizabeth's. We drove to Blockbuster and Meijer, and whenever we passed a man we yelled "Happy Father's day!" Many just scowled like they do to their own kids. Then I yelled it to this like 12 year old and was like, "Happy father's day, now come visit your kid, damnit!" That was good. We got crrrrazy at Meijer's. I chewed a dog toy and ran around. We rode a pony for a penny. Then we went to the castle park (aka not as good as UA's) but that was fun. I made up a song: "Happy, Happy Father's day. Happy day for you! You're bald on the top and round in the middle. Happy, Happy Father's day. Happy, Happy you!" Back at Liz's shack/really nice bedroom we watched  Abandon  again, since that's like our movie, but it was boring. Yes Erica, you figured it out. "SET OF ABANDON!" Then we watched the Early November DVD, hehehe I love you. Then we watched, here it comes the one I'd been waiting for....  Y Tu Mama Tambien" . OH MY GOD. I wanted sex and I got so much s-e-x I absolutely NEVER want to do it! First scene: sex, porn, completely naked woman completely naked man. Sex over here, sex over there, then Saba and his first experience with group sex! WHAHAHA. We had threesomes, we had two somes, we had fastsomes (aka the boys blew it real quick), and we had, my ever-so favorite, GUY ON GUY action! WOO HOO! It was hot as shit.  We watched the Fall Out Boy DVD and that was funny. Then I watched some stuff on the computer, that was good. We went to bed late. And I got up at 8... I was late to babysitting at 9 cause 270 was fucked. Then I babysat for five hours. I thought I was going to die. They were okay, but oh god, then this girl comes to be tutored and her sister is there to wait. So she played with the kids and me. Kid's name is also Allison and she was like, "How old do you think I am? Are you ready for summer? Are you in college? Are you anxious?" Anxious? Anxious for you to SHUT THE HELL UP YOU LITTLE FUCKER. Well that's it.  I leave for Texas on Wendesday. This will be my last entry for a week or so. Wish me fun! Let me know if you want a postcard!  P.S. I just bought a Harry Potter wand at Target.

      I'm never  EVER  babysitting again (that is until tomorrow morning, when I'm freaking babysitting again!) Let's reflect:  I go to babysit the bad kids (aka Gavin-8 and Eleanor-6, the kids who try and rape me/he grabs himself in front of me.) I start making them pizza and everything is fine. But as they finish they start getting gross, like "You must wear a really big diaper?" I'm sorry what? I resond, "Yeah Gavin, at least I'm potty trained!" And he goes, "I'm potty trained!" So I said, "You're right, last year was a big year for you!" FUCKER! Then that freaky cousin who lives in the attic comes down and sees them terrorizing me and offers these words of advise: "I'm feeling really dark, if you want me to discipline them."  So we go outside and play. He rides his bike, she rides her rollerblades. Well, she actually can't ride them and is constantly complaining. I go inside to bring the dog out, but instead run into crazy-cousin, Danielle, who asks me to help her try and stretch her corduroy pants. So we pull and pull for five minutes. Eleanor is pouting excessively and wants to go inside and watch Spy Kids, but the sound doesn't work. She insisted on watching it WITHOUT the sound, but I told her no. Finally, I put them to bed. Well before that, I again had to help stretch those stupid pants.  Now the fun begins. I go downstairs and read some  Harry Potter  for about an hour after I put the kids to bed. Their STUPID dog is barking and running around. I secretly cursed him under my breath. But then he kept biting the curtains, it was really odd. Right as I turn on the TV to watch Sex and the City, I look over my shoulder at the curtains and see Gavin sitting there smiling at me. When the hell did he get there? I freaked out and screamed! He said he had been hiding there for a really long time. But then he was asking me when his parents would get home and begging me not to tell them. I told him I wouldn't tell as long as he went to bed right then and there. Then the dog begins to shit on the carpet. I grab him, sprint out side, and slam the door. Thus realizing that the door was locked and I was now locked outside the house. I left the living room with dog crap on the floor and Carrie and her friends watching naked fireman at some even on the TV. Great, just great. Then I remembered that her mom left a key in the patio. So I sneak across the lawn without shoes on to go into the patio and get the key. The parents finally came home, and first thing, asked if Gavin was tired (he had been to a sleepover the night before), my response? "He didn't seem too tired!"

      Hello.  I just tried to take a nap, but it didn't work. I brought one of my cats in my room to sleep with, but they don't like me.  Last night I saw  Saved! . It was very funny, go check it out. And Bruce, my crazy old neighbor who ran over a cop and then fled the scene, is out of the crazy house. Congratulations, Bruce. I woke up and my mom informed me we were going to go get Indian food. She gave me a John Kerry sticker and button, and I got really excited! But she doesn't want me to wear them in Texas. She thinks I'll get radical and, like Emmit Till, come home without my face. It probably will happen.  Then we went to the Victoria's Secret bra sale. And by sale, they mean four bras cost 80 some dollars.  I have to babysit tonight and I'd really rather read  Harry Potter . I didn't realize how much stuff they left out of the third movie, but they left out a lot. P.S. Anna, if you are reading this, I'm telling you we are going to go see it on our trip! I'm listening to Story of the Year, they are really good and it's refreshing to hear them again. Sorry this entry is boring, I'm gonna go now. Bye.

      Peter, what's happening?  Who can name that quote?  Anyways, not much is going down. Went to Erica's a few nights back. Saw Harry Potter for the fourth time on IMAX BABY. $12 and it wasn't what I thought. I wanted like a planetarium where you could lean back and see below Harry's belt line. Didn't get that. We made wands and I wore Elizabeth's Harry glasses. Erica bought her ticket first. Then it was my turn. The boy asked me, "So are you going to the same show?" No, I'm actually going to go see Chronicles of Riddick you ass face. We begged people around us for money to buy sodas and Erica some cotton candy. Everybody was mean and gave us NOTHING! We came home and played this great game! You need an ad with different styles of checks. Then one person picks their favorite, and the other two have to guess what it was. You can also play with your least favorite. We guessed Erica's favorite, and I got her least favorite. It was good.  I watched Last Comic Standing, and like the judges, I was outraged. This one guy got a standing ovation he was so funny, but he didn't get in the house! It was terrible. I've been looking up colleges and found that I really like DePaul in Chicago. Somebody is going there from this year, who is it? If you know, hook me up. Well my mom is making me clean the litter box, I am really pissed (literally- I'm going to smell like piss).

      My aunt finally left town. It's horrible to say, but I'm glad I live away from my family because they can get annoying. She is so bossy to me! We were playing cards before we were going to go visit her friend at work. She goes, "I hope you are going to wear something nice." Hi, not in a mean way, but your friend flips burgers at Walt's 50's Diner, why do I need to wear something nice?!  Yesterday we went to see John Kerry at the park by my house. My aunt was talking on the phone to my other aunt and telling her about it. "Yes, tonight we're going to go see John Kerry speak, you know that guy who's running for President?" WHAT THE HELL? Why didn't she just say, "Yeah we're going to go see some guy, I forget his name, speak. He is doing... oh what's that little thing, I think he's trying to run for like p-p-president of I don't know what, oh yeah maybe the US, I'm not really sure. It's no biggie at all." God, I love the family! The rally was pretty good. It was raining and I couldn't see anything. I saw the Indian boy of my dreams, he was GORGEOUS, but with an Indian girl. I told my mom that it could be his sister, but alas he was holding her in his arms. Oh tear tear, he could have been my true Aladdin. There were these fuckers with Pro-Life signs, you know how I feel about that. I walked by, looking at these stupid like 15 year old boys, screaming, "Yeah, why don't you try bleeding through your crotch fuckers!" We all yelled at them, I was like, "How do you think it feels to be 17 and celebrating your 6th year on the rag!" That's right boys and girls, six years on June 26. Buy me presents, they must say "Always". Get it?! When I was walking home I saw this woman up ahead a little ways with a Bush sign. I crept up behind her and hissed in her ear! It was so funny, ask me to show you, cause I can't describe how amazing it was.  Last Comic Standing was good last night. I wanted Dan Ahdoot and Monty to go on, but they didn't. Damn. I have to babysit at 1. Eww.  Oh yeah, I had this dream last night. I had this dream that The Early November was at my grandma's house. Ace looked awful! He looked like Bert from The Used, which isn't awful, it's just not what he looks like. Anyways, I asked them if they had a copy of their acoustic CD. Joe said to come out to the car with him. But we ended up getting into the car and driving to downtown Columbus. He then put his arm around me... interesting. We went into this CD store, but they didn't have it. I thought we were going to the car to get it from their trunk, but we tried to go buy it, and they didn't have it. That's it.

      My aunt is in town and is driving me crazy. I got a job. I'm going to be babysitting regularly for these two kids. It's money, but I hate children. I saw Harry Potter for the third time today. He is just so cute. Plus, he's only turning 15 this July. That's just great. I'm 17 and I'm freakishly attracted to a 14 year old. We took my dog on a walk today. He found a package of hot dogs and brought it home. It was this kid's fishing bait...oops. Then I went down to the Ohio Democratic Headquarters to get some tickets for John Kerry tomorrow. This really adorable boy was working, he was COMPLETELY frazzled. This woman asked for like 50 tickets! There was a little brown man in a "John Kerry for President 2004" t-shirt and he had all this paperwork which said he was apart of something for John Kerry. Go little man, go! I got some tickets and then we had a little conversation: Me: "Do you have any volunteer opportunities?" Him: "Well, no not me personally." I don't know if he was being friendly or evil. He had good emo-boy hair. Nice nice.

      I thought this was funny, somebody who shall remain nameless did not, but then again, if you didn't know, my secret, inner dream is to be a stand up comic:  browntrash182: my g-ma passed me a 20 G today browntrash182: and by G i mean dollar bill  Yes, I truly do get that much of a kick out of myself.   Also, if you didn't know, I am just as evil, if not more than, Satan. I know you all know that, however, Amy Fanning will back you up on just how mean I really am. Let me tell you why.  ACT=hard, but the blink/No Doubt concert was vastly approaching and was a very exciting official kick-off of Summer event! The drive was fine, Jenny can't go very fast, but she's my little Nazi. It was horrible, but I was driving and this beat-up old Honda was speeding past. My reply? "Come on Jenny, you little Nazi, beat that Jap!" Yes yes that's horrible. But you see I am evil. Plus, it's a known fact that Japanese cars are the best, not to mention Asians should rule the world, and my little German Volkswagen will probably kill me one day. DAMN YOU ADOLF. What else did I say? It was bad....something relating my car to the Gestapo, oh I don't remember! If you didn't know, I'm not racist, I'm not, stop saying I am... FOOLS I'M MUSLIM! It's really hot right now. Anyways, the concert. We're driving into the parking lot, 1,000 workers with flags every 2 feet were directing us to our EXACT parking spot. SO FUNNY. The line was hot and this kid in front of me judged everything I said. Suddenly, Gwen Stefani came up to the crowd, that girl is so nice. She had NO makeup on at all! You go girlfriend! We finally went in and were the first to pick a seat on the lawn. The next group of people came onto the lawn, by the way it's HUGE, and sat DIRECTLY next to us. Hi, hello, there is probably a mile of grass, and yet you must sit on my lap. Would you like me to spoon-feed you while we're this close? I hate it when people do that! We walked around a bit, and here's where the evil begins. Elizabeth finds a ticket. A seat in the pavilion. I say we keep it. She thinks it's bad. We ponder our next move. We decide to see where the seat is and then decide what to do. She goes down, comes up screaming that we are keeping it and it's right on the floor. We decide to split the blink concert part. I take the first half, I sprint down and watch a few songs. Then I just suddenly grab the guy in front of me and beg for his ticket and then go and get Elizabeth. I'm running, SPRINTING, all around this place screaming "PACK THE STUFF, LET'S MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!" Well, he had a pit ticket, so I had to run to the other side and lie and get a new bracelet. The guy tells Elizabeth to stand on the side, though the original ticket we found had us in the middle, but I promised I'd give back this boy's ticket back, so I raced over to him. Then the pit starts. There is no crossing it. It was evil. So I stood behind the world's tallest man. Hey, it was a hell of a lot better than the lawn, though he smelled quite bad. The guys talked a lot! They were really friendly. Tom wore a bright green polo. His hair was really working for him, as well. This boy behind me caught a drumstick, and I got to touch it..ooh. They walked onto a platform into the pit a little, and Tom turned around and shook his ass, I'm drooling. SO HOT RIGHT NOW AND FOREVER. PS Tom and Mark's kids are getting married, unless I become Mrs. Hoppus first... May/December romance by like 16 years. It could be like Anna Nicole Smith, only I get to have the age spots and ride around in a wheelchair, while little Hoppus gives me lap dances that cause me to grab my oxygen tank and eventually kill me, where he then steals all my millions and ends up marrying little DeLonge anyways, but she keeps her name cause she's cool. That's the future, accept it. When they wheeled Travis off to take him to the middle of the pavilion, like they did at the last show, I started freaking out and screaming, "Okay everybody, get ready, he's going to appear in the middle of the audience.. just get ready!" They all hated me by the way. No Doubt was good, really good. They did a great live show. Kids were freaking out. Old people were screaming at the crowd surfers and taking pictures left and right. At the end, Gwen threw a towel with her makeup on it into the crowd. 20 people tugged and tugged on it for like 5 minutes. I don't know who got it. When we were leaving I saw this guy with a drumstick, I touched it and asked who's it was, when he said Travis I automatically put my cat-like clutch on it and refused to let go. Elizabeth had to coerce me to release my death-like grip. I saw this mom and her three kids walking together in a chain. They wouldn't let go of each other, I was trying to cross, but had to dodge out of their way so I yelled at them, the littlest kid yelled back, I was so pissed I was screaming, "Whatever you little asshole coming here with your mom you stupid baby!" FUCKERS. Somebody flew something at this car and Elizabeth and I screamed at the exact same time, "What the fuck was that?!" Then this car almost hit me. Damn it was fun.

      I'm about to share with you a very, very funny story. Actually, I want you to remember that while you are laughing, this is a terribly sad story. It's not funny at all. And if I ever hear you complaining about your story, especially you Allison Elia, just know that I win this round.  I began my orthodontic treatment when I was in the second grade. By that time my mouth had shown to be very messed up. Doctor Cook began me with some spacers and what not, finally moving up to my first big treatment. I got my palate expander around spring break. I hated when my mom turned the key, it hurt a lot. I spent a week with my aunt who had to do it for me. Needless to say, she didn't do it right, and I had to do an extra week of key-turning. Here and there I had a few teeth pulled (5) and other little things. I got braces: one, two, THREE times! I've probably had every single package of animal rubber bands, from the bear to the eagle, my mouth is a living zoo. I had my fernectame (who knows?) cut off, ligaments scraped from my teeth, my 12 year molars were impacted, had to get gum cut open for those bad boys. I had all my wisdom teeth out and went on a crazy trip with the toenail fungus germ guy. As you can see, I have had it all done! But alas, it's never done. My jaw had a sudden growth spurt, causing everything to shift and become basically fucked up. My 12 year molars are fused to the bone, which apparently very rarely happens, and there is nothing to do about that. Dr. Cook says I may get TMJ, because now my bite is off... and the only way to fix it? Break my jaw and slap on 20 more months of braces. I've decided to decline his offer.  As you can see, my mouth sucks. So NEVER complain about yours! WHAHAHA

      This was really funny. During boot camp Liz and I were researching none other than ACE! Anyways, I found this thing that said the CD was written after he had this terrible breakup or some shit... Me:  Starts to cry  Liz: "What's wrong?"  Reads the quote  "Well, they're not together anymore!" Me:  Continues to cry  Liz: "Are you upset, because of the fact that he's had a girlfriend?" Me: "YES, how did you know?!"  Liz, you know me too well.

      6 babysitting jobs in 5 days. 18 hours and $179 later... and I still hate children. Plus, all that money will be gone in like 2 weeks anyways. Today the little girl slapped me across my eyes and now I have a headache and am in a pissed off mood. Fuckers. Buddy is coming in tomorrow, but ACT's the next day. When will summer begin?! At least after the test it's time for a mini-road trip to CLEVELAND! WOO blink again and No Doubt- old school. That's all for now.

      College boot camp was... pointless? Basically I sat in the computer lab today, that was it. I read my own blog aloud to anyone who would listen, because basically, I'm just that funny! It always got silent at the most awkward moments. Liz, Erica, and I went to walk around the Short North after class. We saw some cool things, especially an old man lying with his legs straight up in the air in the middle of the road. Yes boys and girls, he was hit by a car. 1,000 police men and like 5 different trucks came to his rescue, and by rescue I mean propping him up in a plastic lawn chair. Lucky bastard. We went to Skyline... mmmmmmmmmmmm... and Erica and I ate some dog biscuit. It was like a dry cracker, but it left the worst taste in your mouth! Don't try them. I'm babysitting like a mad woman and it's killing me.

      I haven't blogged in forever! Let's see last Wednesday was Graduation practice and Upper School Night. Nobody noticed my nose ring, well my girls did and they liked it, but the teachers were baffled! But US Night... the White caught me and made me wait and talk to Zazu. It went something like this: Allison: "Hi!" Zazu: "I don't understand what is going on." A: "Well, I did this." Z: "I told you you couldn't do this, you need to go take it out." A: "I can't take it out, it'll close up. If there is a problem you can call my mom." Z: "Well, I obviously can't call her now. Why did you do this now?" A: "It was the only time I could do it." Z: "You couldn't have done it next week?" A: "No, I'm out of town." (a lie) Z: "I really do not know why you would do this! What do you think you are going to do next year? You need to go to the bathroom and take it out right now. I can't let you go out like that." A: "I really don't think people are going to be looking at my nose! I had to do this for myself!" Z: "THIS IS NOT RELIGIOUS!" A: "I'm sorry, and I mean no offense, but culture is in the eye of the beholder. You can't tell me what is culturally right for me. I have had a bad year, and I had to do this for myself!" Z: "If we can't find a bandaid, you are taking it out." We ended up getting a bandaid and it just drew more attention to my nose. F you Zazu and CSG!  That night was the FOB concert. After the seniors blindfolded us and then did that creepy chant thing, Liz dragged me out. I changed shirts on the middle of 270- it was the best show of the night.  We came in a little late, in our CSG skirts might I add. Basically Fall Out Boy was good, but I moved to the back to see and breathe better. Afterwards we went to try and find the guys. I started to remind Patrick about us coming in our uniforms, since he asked us too, and he remembered and that was sweet. Pete remembered Elizabeth, yet again. BASTARD, I AM ALWAYS THERE TOO, haha just kidding. I embarrassed myself in front of Joe, my favorite. I told him it was a good show, but like all of them, they get a little crazy and it's hard for us short people. His response? An annoyed, "Sorry". No, I meant, ooh I'm sorry, let's just have sex. WHAHA just kidding. Later he said he was born in September, like me, and we did a mirror reflecting thing. Odd, like him. I saw this hot guy and I pointed and said, "He's hot!" Then he looked at me and blushed and said he was embarrassed. Me too.  I babysat before graduation. I don't even know what to say. Basically the six year old girl stepped on her eight year old brother's crotch, then slugged me in mine. She took off all her clothes. He grabbed himself in front of me. She put her barbies in her pee. They said "winky" at least 1,000 times. Graduation was boring. But that night was... HARRY POTTER TIME BABY! First I went to Tiarra's graduation party and was hit on by some gangstas, I was frazzled and didn't know what to do. The movie line was crazy. We took pictures with a Sirius look alike and I saw a girl from the FOB concert. The movies was good, but any hardcore fan was a little upset afterwards for various reasons. Ann and I made up gross stuff on the way back to her house.  Friday was the Lola Ray concert with Anna in Cincy. It was good! They are really sweet and talked to her forever. After our interview, we sat and talked for three hours. I was really out of it and probably really rude, ooops. She asked them what they wished they were better at. The hot bass player responded, "Sex, I wish I was better at that." Wanna practice?? The brown lead singer dedicated a song to brown people. And he went to a private school like me and it was Episocpalian like me! CRAZY! SAT 2's were hard. Eww I hate Pickerington. I helped my mom with our garage sale, went to Mari's graduation party, and then went to Trisha's work. We ate pizza and drank soda and watched 8th graders swim. Ann was flirty with them. OOOH ANN LIKES EM YOUNG, CRADLE ROBBER. Actually, we were all going crazy. One with a lisp said, "I'm a fucking player." Right... not! It was pretty funny. The Blockbuster guy was hot. Love it!  College class is dull.. PERRY ROGERS YOU TALKED FOR TOO DAMN LONG. I'm out.

      I have lots to share. I forgot some funny stuff. We had the waltz/tango lesson a couple days ago... it was fantastic. Our teacher's name was Tu (I don't know how to spell it, but it sounds like "two"). He had Asian emo-boy hair, he was so freaking hot. Anyways, he kept doing routines I liked and I kept shouting, "Tu, you're the one!" I dunno, I thought it was funny. Then Elizabeth almost ran him over and I yelled, "If you ran over Tu, there'd be none!" That was great. He was hot. When I was at my Grandma's we were planning to go to a family BBQ. My aunt Sharon told my mom to call my aunt Sue and invite her. And my grandma, who sits at home all day long, said, "Yeah, because they have NO life!" It was soo funny! Last night was the The Underground Network/The Matches/Maxeen/Matchbook Romance concert. Oh it was great! It was at Flanagan and I didn't like that. We got there at like 4... not even one band was there yet. Anna was supposed to have an interview with Maxeen and we got to go along. We had it with Tom, oh my he is GORGEOUS! I'm not kidding, his face is just so pleasant. The table only had two chairs, so he pulled another two up. He was such a gentleman, oh they raise them right in Akron, Ohio. He was really articulate too and gave really good answers. She asked him what he was like in high school, and I just started to laugh. He looked over and I was like, "Oh sorry, I just really hate high school." WHAHAHA. The concert started like four hours later, oooooooooo the wait was annoying. This girl ran up to a member of Matchbook Romance and grabbed and hugged him. Then she asked where he was in Chicago, and he said stoically, "I was there." Then they stood for like a minute in silence and he just walked away. It was really embarrassing for her. The Underground Network was really good. They're from "Lorain fucking Ohio" and the lead singer was pretty cute. He had a truck driver hat on with a picture of Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. and it said "Dumb and Dumber". The Matches were AWESOME! The lead singer had this crazy hair that was all combed over to one side and spiky. He was a fox. They spit on us a lot. Maxeen was also really good. When Tom sings he bounces and it's really cute. When they were setting up MBR I saw a pick and asked for it. WOO HOO GOT IT ON MY OWN! The crowd got crazy for MBR. There were these boys, I've never seen anybody get more excited for a band than them. They were screaming to the lead singer about how hot he is and how much they love him. A pick fell and this boy pushed everybody down and practically climbed on stage to get it. They were nice though, one kept saying he was sorry that I was in the front and getting pushed. I told him, "Oh I don't mind when you use me to propel yourself into the air, but the sudden punches are what scare me!" I also grabbed a pic. Anna and I were really raped. Boys are gross, I don't like their touch. Eww. At one point, I just felt something climbing down my chest. I look down, and one of the boys was literally grabbing me, it was creepy as hell. But I laughed a lot. But I was also scared, because they were pushing me forward, and the bassist kept bending down with his bass right in my face. I was positive I was going to get pushed and slam my head right against it. Every time it got close I screamed, and I think he saw. Everybody started screaming for them to play "Tiger Lily" and he was like "how did you know?" And Elizabeth shouts, "It's on the playlist!" And he goes, "You're not supposed to read that! You're a cheater!" And everybody was screaming cheater... it was so funny! But then he like had a conversation with her about her shirt and promised to give her the list after the show. Of course some other girl got it, but she told him and he got her another one! Anna said to him, "I like your jellies" and he said, "You like my what?!?!!?" SHE MEANT HIS BRACELETS! IT WAS GREAT! The show didn't end till like 12:30... ahh! Then I showed Elizabeth how their song, "My Eyes Burn" is basically the story of my life. I think I will share the lyrics with you, read them and see if you can guess why:  My eyes burn from these tears You think you'd learn over these years Good things won't last forever  So what the hell am I suppose to do You only wanted the things I couldn't give to you And you had it all anyway  So take take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place  So take take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place  Tell me I'm wrong when I say I can't expect you to stay forever with me I live for that single moment  I take back everything I've said You wore those words on your lips As if they meant anything anyway  Sometimes I feel I could drop off the face of the earth It seems I do more harm than good And I don't know if it's worth me loosing sleep over this  So take take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place  So take take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place  Tell me I'm wrong when I say it I can't expect you to spend forever with me I live for that single moment  So take take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place [x2]  If you know me, you'll get it. Anyways we had Graduation practice today. It was funny. Lauren Smiley is the shit! Everybody was nice about my nose, they were proud of me. Love you kids! Well I'm out. Fall Out Boy tonight, but tomorrow HARRY FREAKIN POTTER! HELL YES.

      I know I said I wouldn't be blogging for awhile, but we came home last night instead of this morning. Chicago is so beautiful. Oh, first we went to Purdue, but we got so lost we missed the info session so we just drove around. It's in the middle of NOWHERE, but the campus is pretty! We got lost in Chicago, but eventually found our way. My mom is crazy. She'll be like, "Damn this shit&nbsp;bastards I hate you, this is all your fault, Allison, omg look at that building, it's so beautiful!" My mother is bipolar for reals. That night we had this HUGE meal and then went on a boat ride around the city and Lake Michigan. Chicago is so clean, it's unreal. It's a big city, but it still feels Midwestern. This boy on the boat kept talking to me and I was about to smack him and tell that kid to shut it! His sister kept grabbing him and it was weird, damn hicks from Kansas. The next morning we went to the Lincoln Park campus of DePaul... only to be at the wrong campus. So we took the L to the main campus. We walked in and there is this huge sign that says, "Welcome Allison Ansari" WHAT THE FUCK?! People kept coming in and looking at it, and I was completely embarrassed. It's weird to see your name on the big screen, not that that's what it was, but close enough. This Indian man walked us around. We went to their new housing project, shared by two other schools, and went on the longest ass tour around that shit. We met up with lots of other people and it took forever. The place was amazing, but I would never be put into that house, so why waste time? This mom asked, "Are there key cards for mothers? You know, so if mothers want to come in and check on stuff, they don't have to wait for their kids to come down and check them in and everything?" That kid had to have shit his pants, we all practically laughed in that lady's face. What a dick. My mom and I were like, "It's time to let them go, lady!" We started our drive home, and got lost a lot. Anna and I didn't have this many problems...&nbsp;9 hours later we got home, and that's about it.  So today I went to check out the Early November website. 1. Ace has&nbsp;a girlfriend. 2. Jeff has a girlfriend. 3. Even though they're recording, they won't be touring for a long time and 4. Jeff is telling everyone to go out and listen to The Matches- therefore everybody will, and STOP IT, DAMNIT, THE MATCHES ARE MINE. I don't like to be possessive, but when I read that my blood started to boil. I was not the first Matches fan, and I won't be the last, but I think I'm a pretty good fan. By the end of the summer, I will have seen them five times, and Jon ALWAYS asks ME for drugs- that is saying something! AND they are nothing like The Early November, so those preppy kids are going to be all like, "OMG look at his [Shawn's] clothes and..." I'm just pissed. I don't know why, well actually, I do. I have to go to my dad's house tonight. And tomorrow, I was going to visit Drexel by myself, but now one of his friend's daughter is coming with me- I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO BABYSIT.  HAHA I just reread what I wrote about The Matches, damn I'm obnoxious. Sorry kids. But still... they're mine.  Now I probably won't be talking to you guys for a while. Dad's til Tuesday night 10 PM and then Cali 11 AM Wednesday morning. Talk to you kids soon. Peace.

       Move over, Ace. Tom Bailey has arrived.     &nbsp;   Well... Ace is still hot, but Tom... num nums. Okay, so even though it's 3 AM and I leave in like five hours, if I don't blog now, I'll forget everything. That's right, I'm leaving for like 3 weeks. You better miss me and call my cell to keep me company.    Tonight Anna and I drove to Cleveland to see MAXEEN. We saw two houses on trucks on our way up. Then I saw this car that was driving really badly and had Bush stickers. The girl driving was eating ice cream that looked like a "dildo" according to Anna. Anna was calling her mom and she goes, "I hate it when people lick their ice cream so it gets all tall...hey mom!" AHH I think it was like that, well it was pretty funny at the time. When we were almost there we saw all the land markers, Anna was like, "There's the restaurant, there's the club, and there's Shannon!" Shannon is the guitarist in Maxeen who only wears black. We got to Pirate's Cove and paid $10 to park. That's freaking highway robbery! Then we met this kid from a local band that was pretty hot. Then we went and waited in line. You have to enter the pizza place to get to the club, yeah, it's messed up. These girls there were horrible! One was obsessed with Hoobastank and goes, "We hang out with them and are on a first name basis!" OKAY! NOBODY SAID YOU WEREN'T!. She was such a bitch. Then Anna told me these two girls apparently ate with the Early November, but the guys didn't have any money, so the girls &nbsp;had to buy. Okay, you were totally used. Anyways, every five minutes I heard her talking about Ace, and I got really pissed. Finally, they let us in. That's where I met the guy who works the door. OOOH this guy! It was $3 more for being underage. I go, "You know, since you make me pay more, it makes me really want to try and get alcohol!" He didn't respond so I go, "Okay, you really don't care." and he goes, "No, I do care." But he didn't. We got some good seats. Then these two random bands played. I don't remember the first one, but the singer looked like Ashton's friend in  The Butterfly Effect  who was also in Boy Meets World. He was really screamy (bad, cause all the other bands were pop/emo) and this club was freaky. There were stairs leading up and the windows were black, but random light came through. I thought I was going to die. The second band was Rebecca Have Mercy. They were just okay. But they had this cult following. One boy, a friend of theirs, jumped onstage during a song and started screaming with them. Then he straddled the amp and writhed up against it. WHOA. Limbeck was pretty good. They are really funny when they play. Patrick said, "Hells yeah!" and "For reals!" he makes everything plural. It was funny. Maxeen was amazing. Tom is a beautiful, beautiful man. But, he had on this shiny, black vest that was not so attractive. We left to go find Patrick for the interview and see Maxeen. Good thing we did, because we also saw... TOMMY FROM THE NEWPORT! Yes, the one and only Tommy Laudermilk (don't know if that's exactly right) and he was wearing his good hat! We talked to the lead singer from Limbeck and he gave us stickers for free since we are "nice people". Tom was good looking and I love him. We told him he played our favorite song, and he asked, "'Poison June'?" We were like, "How did you know?!" and he said he just did. Then I said, "Well, I originally thought it was, 'poison a jew'". And this girl got all defensive and Anna was like it's not true and Tom was like, "Yeah, it's not true!" Jay was super sweet! They're going to Japan to tour with blink 182! I freaked out and asked to go with him! I didn't hear it, but Anna said that Jay said, "Yeah, we need a merch girl!" He also said he liked my Matches t-shirt, asked if I saw them on Warped, and then was like, "Well, how are they doing!?" So I told them that they had lots of fans and seemed to be doing pretty well. He was really interested in hearing if they were doing well. He asked if we'd seen The Format, which I hadn't, and he told me I had to watch them and that I'd like them. Anna grabbed Tommy and we talked to him! He was AWESOME! He's only 24... totally fine for Anna. Jay came back over and told us they had a 9 hour drive and were leaving. I told him good luck with the Japan tour and to tell Tom DeLonge&nbsp; I said hi. He goes, "Right, I'll tell him that this girl in Cleveland said hey!" and I said, "Yeah, he'll remember." Cause in my dreams, he would. Then he pointed at me and said, "Watch The Format, you'll love them!" We watched some Steel Train and I saw this kid who looked like Jeff from TEN. Then we found Patrick and went to do the interview. That went pretty well. He took us back inside through the back entrance, since the guy at the door hated me and wouldn't let me leave to get a drink. We watched a lot of The Format, but we both felt sick so we left. We said goodbye to Patrick and then encountered two homeless men on route to our car and another at the gas station. He started to pump my gas for me, so I gave him $2. He goes, "Can I have food instead?" Uh... no. Then he asked for all my change. Jesus, take what you can get. He goes, "Just hope that you are never homeless and have to pump gas and wash people's windows. It's so degrading." I was like, "Well, at least you are trying to do the best you can." But, stop asking for more! That was pretty much it. Oh yeah, I almost ran off the road, but it's cool.    Don't miss me too much when I'm gone. I know I won't miss you. Just kidding. Peace.

       HELLO!!!     &nbsp;   I'm tired, like usual! I just do not sleep anymore. Anyways, it's been a crazy weekend. Wednesday I went over to Trisha's. First, Megan picked up Ann and me, because I'm to lazy to drive to Westerville/I refuse to drive all over this country to get to a sleepover. Anna called me during our drive up. She told me that Norman had sent her an e-mail and said he missed us! Well, probably just her, but I pretend like it was us. Norman is from Lylah and we stayed at the Super 6 with him in Dallas. P.S. Anna and I are going to find that number and call TK and STALKKKKK HIM! HE'S MY LOVAHHH! Then we got to Trisha's and her sister showed me the Sims, cause I don't know much about that game. Then we read some magazines and waited for Margaret to get there. We ordered Chinese food, and refused to let Trisha drive to get it, since she's strict and doesn't allow fun in the car! These customers questioned me about my Sirius Black shirt. Trisha and I played with this video screen and tried to make up orders, but it didn't work. We went back and put in  Van Wilder  and ate some Chinese food. I spilled sweet & sour sauce&nbsp;all over&nbsp;her Spongebob pillow- oops I got into trouble! There was rice and sauce EVERYWHERE! Then we kept getting scolded about being too loud. We were loud the whole night. We watched  Office Space , but didn't watch  Cold Mountain , the entire purpose of the sleepover! We played the figure 8 game, that was good times. Ann suggested getting crazy and going out and TPing something! Trisha said no. We were going to climb out her window, but again she said no. So we went to bed. Ann had a dentist appointment, so we had to leave at like 8.&nbsp; "First and Last!" HAHA Megan!    I babysat Thursday night and then drove up to Cleveland. I got in around 10:15, and both my aunts were sleeping. See, nobody could go to Cleveland Warped with me. So I wasn't going to go, but my aunt Sally came in from Maine and wanted me to&nbsp;drive up and&nbsp;visit. So I decided to drive up and go to the show by myself, I'd always wanted to anyways. The next morning I talked to my aunt Sally for a while and then got ready for the show. I left and got in around 11:30. Okay, you have to pay $10 to park and then walk 6 miles to get to the show. You have to climb down cliffs and cross roads, it's dangerous and evil! Though my ticket said 12, Allister was playing while I made me trek to the entrance. I got inside and went to find the big schedule. Big? Try it was a quarter of the size of the one in Texas. You couldn't see it over people's heads! I wrote down the times of people I wanted to see, of course everyone was overlapping! That's why you have to go to several shows, or you'll never see everything! The first thing I wanted to see was Matchbook Romance, at 1:15, of course Sugarcult was at 1:30- don't you just love that luck! So I walked around to the booths during my wait. I needed to know when The Matches were playing, but I couldn't find their booth! I walked around like 6 times before I found it. Their merch guy- kinda cute. Gorgeous blue eyes, not usually my favorite, but gorgeous! He was like, "How are you doing?" and I said fine and asked him the same and he goes, "Well I'm fine now. " LOVER. Then, Jon, I freaking worship that kid, runs up to me:    Jon: "Do you have any heroin or cocaine?!"    Me: "Uhhh... no."    Jon: "Nothing?&nbsp;I need something!"    Me: "I have some gum."    Jon: "Is it nicorette? Cause I need something STRONG!"    Me: "How come every time I see you you are talking about cocaine?"    Jon: "I just really need some."    Then I was looking at their shirts, and I decided I wanted to buy one. So I told Jon I wanted the red one, and he goes, "What about this shirt. Will you buy the shirt I'm wearing?" WHAT?! Buy the shirt off your back?? I told him I didn't know. He goes, "Okay, both shirts for $20. I really love this shirt, but I want to sell it to you." So I did, he peeled it right off his body and handed it to me. He wrote a note on it in silver sharpie about how poor he is. That kid is so funny.    I went over to watch MBR. Those kids in the crowd got K-RAZY. Did you like that? I just made it up. Andy walks on in big Aviator glasses. Judas and Aaron buzzed their heads. Aaron looks good, but Judas betrayed Jesus, so he looked like the asshole that he always is! Ryan, I think is the bassist, has always been cute. They played pretty well. Andy has a huge, thick pink guitar strap, which was pretty hot. I tried to take pictures. I ran back to try and catch the end of Sugarcult. I heard the very end of "Bouncing Off the Walls Again" and then I heard "Okay, see ya later!" So I ran back to go see The Matches, but I couldn't find the stage, so I had to ask the merch guy. They didn't get a stage, just two blue tents. They deserve much more! This guy was complaining that they weren't on a stage, it was bad, they were for Texas. AND they only played 4 songs- what the fuck?! I stood right in front of the speaker. Justin fell and knocked the tent down. Stuff was flying everywhere. Shawn looked AMAZING with his tan and salmon colored shirt. AMAZING. I got a guitar pic. Then I saw that kid that I saw at Flanagan's. I went up and tried to talk to him and he was such a jerk! He was like, "I don't know, I'm from New York." OKay, you're not hot enough to be such a jack ass! But still, The Matches are awesome and I wouldn't want to talk to some random girl over Jon either! Then I went to the FYE booth to get my Matches t-shirt signed. Oh, well I was wearing my "Bert is MY Homeboy" shirt, and a million people commented on it! Anyways, I gave my t-shirt to Shawn to sign and he goes, "I like your shirt!" I was so flattered, since you know he makes his own clothes, and I go, "Thanks! I really like all your designs." Then he signed my shirt, and his signature is really cool, and I said, "Wow your signature is awesome." The drummer was like, "Mine or his?" and I go, "Uhh.. both!" Then Shawn said, "Well, we just like everything about each other, don't we?" and gave a little wink! Dude is so hot. Then I went to get in line for Taking Back Sunday. I mean, going through that line is kind of pointless, you don't get to talk to them, and I have already done it, but Adam is just so dreamy! I saw these girls that I saw when I went to see MBR and FOB. We talked a bit. I told him about how Desiree is trying to steal Ace and how I despise her. There was another girl who was FREAKing out to see TBS. Finally, the line moved and we went in for the kill. I am obsessed with the screamer, I always get the names confused, but he is always just so nice! One guy said he liked my shirt. I waved at Adam, who was wearing a camo shirt and a smile. They had these stickers out, and one guy told me to grab one, even though I told him I already took a bunch, then the last guy goes, "Take one, Bert would want you to." Bert- you made me loved that day, and I owe you so much.    THEN I went to go get some MBR stuff signed. That line was crazy, people always choose to walk in front of ME, why?? I almost said something, but the next person to do it was Matt from The Matches, good thing I held my tongue. They had a poster they signed. Ryan asked everybody their name, and then wrote it in the corner:    Ryan: "Who should I make this out to?"    Me: "Allison, with two L's!"    Ryan: "Of course, how else would you spell it?! One L SUCKS!"    Aaron, wearing an "Everybody Loves a Jewish Boy" t-shirt (kid is INDIAN!), pointed to my shirt and was like, "I love your shirt!" then he tapped Judas and was like, "Judas, Judas, I like her shirt!" Judas was super unfriendly to everybody. Andy was kind of nice, but sitting right behind him was that HORRIBLE girlfriend of his. Then I turn around and who do I spy? FUCKING DESIREE! I was like, "What are YOU doing here?!" But I was nice. SHe goes, "Well Andy knows I want a picture, so he told me to just wait here!" I walked away, turned around, tapped her on the table and said, "Desiree, did I tell you I went to TEXAS to see The Early November?!?!" She was like, "Oh no, good for you!" And I go, "All for Ace, baby!" Apparently, a friend of hers took a picture of Joe for her. Right, cause a picture is the EXACT same thing as fucking them on their tour bus. Yeah, I think I win! TAKE THAT BEEYATCH. Then I walked around a little and saw some Hidden In Plain View. I needed to change the film in my aunt's camera, but I'm not going to lie, I don't know how. The kid from Noise Ratchet said he could do it, of course, two shots later and the whole roll rewound. Right, damn&nbsp;religious kids&nbsp;fuck up everything! JUSTTTTT kidding!Then I watched Dynamite Boy. They were good. I talked to, I think it's Sam, earlier in the day.&nbsp; Love that kid- he hooked me and Liz up to meeting FOB, back when their fans weren't so god damn obnoxious. Then I walked with those girls to go watch New Found Glory, which was good. Then I lost them and hung out with myself until 8 to see Taking Back Sunday. I had entered a drawing, and won a t-shirt, which was made for an infant, I swear, so I gave it to my anorexic aunt. I watched some random bands and looked at all my free stuff. Oh, and I bought the first Drive-Thru DVD from an English guy, who was really cute. TBS was amazing. Simply, amazing. The screamer was like, "Ohio is my favorite place to play ever!" He probably didn't mean it, but why would he even say it, who knows. Adam has definitely stepped up his microphone abilities. He was a magician throwing that thing all over the place. The way he wraps it around his neck, then snaps it off to sing, is brilliant. He was so cute. He thanked security and the people behind the scenes. Then he, being the poet he is, goes, "And you guys, if it weren't for you, none of us could be here. The fuck load of you make this possible!" It was something like that, oh it was perfect. Then those girls and I started to head out. But before we did, we saw Sean from Yellowcard! CRAZY, cause they are never around. He was wearing a pink polo and checked pants, like a little golfer. He signed my book and took pictures. Anna talks about how nice he is, but you couldn't really talk to him, since he was on the phone and a bunch of people were coming from every corner! I was trying to get my photo while this other girl was trying to get something signed and she goes, "You can do her first." Well, it made me laugh. After another trek back to the car, I got a call from Anna and she told me about Mae. Seems she had fun. Then I drove to my aunt Maureen's, where the whole family was. They bombarded me with questions, and I was like, "I'm too tired for this!" SO we went back to my aunt Sharon's and I had like five sandwiches, since I hadn't eaten all day. The next morning I went to my cousin Jenel's house and to visit my grandma. Then I drove home and babysat. I babysat this morning again, then went to see Chelsea's travel pictures, then went to lunch and to look at pictures with Ariel, and then came home and blogged. I'm very tired, I think I need a nap. Bye.

       I have been getting horrible cramps in my legs and feet all day! It's unbareable and taking over my life.&nbsp;    So yesterday I babysat. The lady has not been paying me everyday, like she said she would. Which is causing her to not pay me the correct amount. Fucker.    Anyways, yesterday was time to see The Working Title (aka stupid-as-fuck Joel, who's hot and stupid and cool all at the same time). I also had to volunteer for the Young Voter's Project. That wasn't too exciting on my list of excitments, and I worried about Anna getting bored, but I had been told it wouldn't take long. Well it's a good thing Erica called me. I told her I was going to the concert, and she wanted to come, so Erica and Anna came over around 7. I was supposed to be at the club at 7:30, but my mother had hidden my backpack (with ID) and then gone out with the dog. So I drove around until I found her.&nbsp; Then I drove by screaming, "I'm going to kill you...Where's my backpack?...I'm going to kill you!" Great times.    We got there a little late, and I was screaming, "Come on, time is money!" So I had no idea who would be there and how I would find out what to do next. On Saturday, when Luke showed me the sign up sheet, nobody was signed up. And yet... who did I spy talking to kids?? LUKE! WHAHAHA just kidding! I mean he was there, and I may have a tiny little crush on him, but no Erica, I'm not going to hound in on him&nbsp;about what's in his CD player! So I went and got my clipboard and signed up Erica and Anna. Then I signed up this girl that Anna had seen at a few shows, but more on her later. So I went towards the back of the crowd and Luke worked the front so we could meet in the middle. Then I got into a fight. I find this kid, with these freaky, blown-glass earrings ( I assumed were from Fenton Glass, yeah you know it!) and I give him my speech.    Guy: "Alright then, let's do it!"   Me: "Okay, let's do it."   Guy: "Yeah, let's do it."   Me: "Okay, this is really awkward now."   Guy: "Is it?"   Me: "Yes it is, can you just sign it?"    Later...    Me: "Just check the box for the issue that will most likely influence your vote."   Guy: "Well, I think I'm going to check other and write the issue that is most important to us all."   Me: "What's that?"   Guy: "Abortion."   Random girl wearing a potato sack: "Cause we don't believe in killing babies!"   Me: "Look, you really don't want to get into this with me."    Then we start getting into it...    Me: "Yeah, cause if I get raped, it just makes all the sense for me to have to keep that baby!"   Guy: "Yeah."   Me: "Listen, you are a guy, you don't even know WHAT you are talking about, and I don't want to hear it! Finish the pledge, cause now it is really awkward."    &nbsp;  So there were two other bands playing (Noise Ratchet and Me Without You) who were Christian bands! No wonder I had a lot of Bush support and kids in cross t-shirts. After we hit the line, Luke and I went and sat to wait for Rose. We talked about the Chrisitan kids, and I was like, "No, I'm here for The Working Title, no Christian bands!" We started talking about music a little bit, and I slipped in Texas (Anna- we tell strangers on the side of the road) and he agreed to the love for the Warped Tour. Then I told him I him about my fight. He was like, "No I get it. But we are a peacful group." Dude, you do NOT test me on this issue, ESPECIALLY if you are a guy, so there will be no peace kept here! Then Rose came and yelled at me since I didn't go to the headquarters first. Fuck you, I'm a volunteer- you take what you can get! So we went inside and started to talk to lots more people.&nbsp; Anna and Erica came in, Erica complaining about the price, and then we ran into Saddler (the crazy kid who smokes pot with his mom) and oddly enough, he remembered me. That's a very rare occurance. They went to stand by the stage while I continued my work.&nbsp;At one point, I went up to this couple (who already talked to Luke) and he came over and put his arm around me and goes, "I'm sorry, I should have told you I already talked to them!"&nbsp;Later he called&nbsp;me sassy. I left to go watch TWT.&nbsp; That girl Anna knew kept staring at me- seriously WHO IS SHE?! At one point, Erica whispers in my ear, "You can see which side their penis hangs on!" So, I started laughing. I laughed so hard, and at the exact same moment, they went quiet, so it was just me laughing.&nbsp; Joel's hair: did a&nbsp;strong wind current sneak up behind him? He goes, "Everytime we come here, we're sick. What's up with you people...always being sick?" KID IS SO STUPID. Then I continued my volunteering. I complained a lot to leave. Rose completely disappeared. Oh and she kept rubbing Ross (drummer from TWT) and I saw her use her sexuality to get people to sign the pledge! Eventually it was over. The ticket man looked like Steve Buscemi. I asked him why the smoking band hadn't taken effect:    &nbsp;  Me: "Excuse me, sir."   Steve look-a-like: "Did you just call me sir?"   Me: "Well... I didn't want to be rude. I was just wondering why people could smoke in here after the smoking ban?"   Steve look-a-like: "It won't take affect for 60 days."  He raises his cigarette from under the counter    Me: "Uhh, not that there is&nbsp;anything wrong with your cigarette smoking!"   Steve look-a-like: "It doesnt' matter, I'm not going to stop!"&nbsp;    &nbsp;  We tried to go get food with Saddler, but the place was closed. So we came back and Rose comes up to me and goes, "I thought you had left! I hope you don't mind that I got a beer. It's after work, but I don't want you to think badly about me!" Then when we finally did leave, she asked if I smoked! Joel and some guys had a dance-off. Then we saw this couple MAKING OUT HARDCORE. It was disgusting! When they finished, everybody cheered, but I walked by and muttered: "You make me sick." Then we went and got Wendy's and 5&nbsp;free five-piece chicken nuggets! SCORE! We watched some Drive-Thru DVD: "So she rolls up and I'm all, 'Take off your clothes!' and she's like, 'Why?' and I'm like, 'Cause that's what publicists DO!'"-Ace. Finally, around 4, we went to bed, only to get up at 8 so I could go babysit. When Erica was leaving, we hugged and she whispered in my ear, "Our balls are touching" then we rubbed our "man beards" on each other. Love those drive-thru bands!   Good times were had.

       Am I typing in color? Blogger has got some new shit.     &nbsp;   Lots to share, let's begin.     &nbsp;   Thursday I babysat in the morning, and then I drove to Anna's, where I could not park my car properly, and had to have her do it for me. We stopped at Wal-Mart, like we always do before a trip, and when we were leaving she goes, "I think I'll take out the Starting Line CD" and then what do we hear? "THE REASON" DAMNIT I'M SO SICK OF THAT SONG. We drove up to Cleveland to see Never Heard Of It. I named all the counties along the way. We headed towards The Phantasy Nite Club, which was crappy and old. We walked around, cause nobody was there. Well, we did see this kid walking with his parents wearing pants that said "Fuck" all over them. We went into the drug store to go pee. We had to go to the courtesy counter and ask through the bullet-proof glass for the key. Anna saw a bunch of Hostess products, Ohio never fails us! We went back to wait in line/by the door. The band still hadn't arrived. But then, I saw the RV. They drove by and DJ was looking out the window and we waved. So attractive. Their RV is PIMPING! It has their name all over it and they have a trailer with good stickers. DJ walked around and gave us hugs and we talked about Anna's upcoming interview. We had to talk to their tour manager or something, Nosh (don't know how to spell, sounds like "No-shhhh"). Rick walked around, but he ignored us and looked really bad. I hate to say it, but bring back the California surfer-dude hair, and lose the nose ring. It looked like he always had a booger, but it was the ball on his nose ring. We sat with Jeff for literally two hours. He kept having Anna massage his back. She tried standing up, but he thought that was weird, so he asked to sit between her legs- WHOA! He was so needy. Every five minutes he'd be like "Higher... no lower. Now scratch it." EWW I glared at him and he goes, "You must think I'm a dick." He was really nice the first night, but more on that later. We learned that since Greg's departure, they brought on this 17-year-old named Dan. I was quite excited to see this kid. They weren't playing until 10:45, so we didn't go inside until about 9. We were actually on the list, SURPRISE! The first two bands we saw were okay. The club had all these black lights, which revealed several embarrassing stains on my jeans. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GOT THERE! We met NHOI's new merch guy, but I can't remember his name. I want to say Kevin, maybe that's right. He shook our hands and winked, it was quite cute. Anna bought&nbsp;the tequila shirt of theirs, and I read the Spanish part. Finally, they went on. Dan was really cute! He had a semi-mullet, but he had a lip ring- ON THE GOOD SIDE! Anna told me that when DJ sings he gets right in your face. I told her he better not, cause that will scare me. And scare me it did, cause he gets right up in your grill. Then he'd shake his head and his sweat would go everywhere! They were very good live. Lots of energy. But they didn't play "Veronica" like Jeff said they would. After, we went back to the merch table. DJ apologized that they didn't play "Veronica" but said that they would the next night. We met Dan, who was just as cute in person. On their message boards, people say he can guess your birthday. We tried to play the game, but he didn't do so well. The guys seemed to like my "Real Men Love Unicorns" t-shirt. Dan said he loves unicorns, the beach, marshmallows, and the color pink. Good boy. There was this girl there with these tattoos. One on her arm was of a naked woman. Dan kept going over and pinching the boobs, and Anna goes, "Look! You got some action!". Then the girl pulls down her pants and shows this weird tattoo on her thigh. I saw some stuff of hers, I don't think she wanted to share. She should probably keep her pants buckled, I mean, just a thought. When we were driving home, Anna called her friend, Karly, and told her about the massage thing and him being between her legs. Karly was on spearkerphone, and I heard her ask, "Did you get wet?" I STARTED LAUGHING SO HARD- WHO IS THIS KID?!    We went to my aunt's house, where she had labeled everything we would use, and then watched some Blind Date and went to bed. The next morning we went to my aunt Sue's to burn a copy of the Lola Ray CD for Jeff, he had asked for it. Then we got ready and drove to Toledo for the show. Anna saw a sign for "Fangboner Road". It made us remember Texas and how we giggled at "Harry Hines Boulevard" or as I called it, "Harry Hinds Boulevard!"&nbsp;The place was called "Missi's Blues" or something like that.&nbsp; But it was spelled M-I-S-S-I... that's HORRIBLE! They didn't show up for a while. Finally, the huge NHOI RV pulled up. We gave Jeff his CD and Dan some beads to put on his shoelaces, Anna's newest creation. The guys were pretty nice and everything. Nosh said we'd do the interview around 5:30. Jeff took these two girls into the RV. Finally NOSH was like, "Yeah, Jeff will come get you when he's finished getting his 'massage'!" WHAT?! Anna gives him massages, not those two ho's. What was THAT about? That began the dislike for Jeff. Around 6 or so, once it started to pour rain (of course), Nosh calls out from the RV "Allie, come on in!" Who's Allie? Well, he meant us. He got confused. Anna was like, "Her name is Allison..." and he's like "Yeah yeah." Okay, whatever. We walk in the RV and those skanks with Jeff were there. One was adjusting her boobs. Right.... a back massage? Try lower. Nosh kicked them out, thankfully. Jeff and DJ were doing the interview. I turned my head and saw Rick without his shirt on. I was very embarrassed. The interview went pretty well. Then we left and talked to Dan outside a little. He's from Mexico and speaks Spanish, very nice. We went inside and talked to him a lot more there.&nbsp; He is a funny kid. Let me remember some good stuff: at one point he was talking about something (I can't remember what) and then he goes, "That'll be my thing." And Anna goes "And putting beads on your shoelaces can be my thing." And I asked, "Well what can be my thing?" And Dan goes, "We can put our things together." MY EYES GOT SO BIG AND I JUST STARTED LAUGHING. He forgot our birthdays, but kept trying to guess. He was staring at me trying to remember, and I got nervous and was biting my lip and scrunching my face, and he goes, "I love that face!" I'm so scared of eye contact! Then we were talking and he's like, "You wanna go on a date?" HELL YEAH. He says "Fuck yeah, dude" all the time. He wants to tattoo it across his stomach. That's hot. He gave us guitar picks, but then borrowed mine for the show. He promised to give it back, and after the show he&nbsp;he did as he said "Sorry it's so gross and wet". No problem, I don't mind. We talked a little more to some of&nbsp;the guys and these kids from Michigan. We were saying bye to Nosh, and DJ walked over and just put his arm around me. My god, that man smells like angels, it's amazing. And his back, talk about definition. SO hot. Rick was a lot nicer the second night, but Jeff became a dick. Overall, it was a pretty good time! We drove home and then I went back to mi casa to go to sleep and prepare for Saturday.   &nbsp;   So let's begin with Saturday. It was a good day. I was going to volunteer for the Young Voters Project. I went there at 11 to have a training session with Stephen. This annoying 20-something-year-old guy, Jeremy, joined us and kept trying to be better than me. After our session, some of the workers started to come in for the day. This kid, Luke, was leaning against the wall reading the newspaper. He had a hat on and his headphones around his neck, he was kind of cute. RJ drove myself, Luke, Becca, and the funniest kid I've ever met, James, down to the Jazz and Rib Festival where we'd be trying to get people to sign our petition to vote this November. James was like "Are you excited?" and I said yes, and he goes, "You sure don't look it!" And I was like "NOO... I am just really tired, I was out of town yesterday." They were talking about going out that night and James asked me what I was doing and he goes, "You're 18 right?" And I said no, and nobody believed me that I was 17. RJ dropped us off and then we set off for the festival. James kept freaking out about jay walking (is it like that or is it just "j walking", I don't really know) and he goes, "When I was a kid, I thought it was just walking in a 'J'". Then he started doing it in the middle of the road. We got up to the festival and James was going on about how he had to pee. We stopped at a Port-a-Potty, but he goes, "I won't go in those, just find me a tree!" Then Luke goes, "Okay James and Becca you stay at this entrance. Allison and I will go down to the other." Great, I have to spend 4 hours with some relatively cute guy, I wonder how I will embarrass myself today. So we walk down and he was telling me that he's from NYC and is just here for 6 weeks to work on this project. He was like, "Yeah, I'm going to do my part to take Bush down!" So now you're 10 times cuter. Actually, he really wasn't that cute, but he does oddly resemble Jason Mraz.&nbsp; Something in the eyes. So I watched him talk to people in the beginning. A bunch of people were jerks and wouldn't listen, then we get one. The first guy is some hick, but he was a good guy.&nbsp; He was like "At first, I thought Bush was&nbsp;a good idea. But now, this is horrible..." and he went on and on and he was swearing like none other! Luke was like, "Yeah man, that anger is understandable." I was biting my lip trying to not laugh. This kid is from NYC and here he is talking to this hick guy with no teeth. Welcome to Ohio. Then I went off to talk to this couple. This guy comes over and starts talking to me when they are finished:     Guy: "What are you doing?"       I explain the petition and ask if he wants to sign    Guy: "No, I don't want to sign that, I want to know what you are doing. I think you are really cute. Maybe we could hang out some time."    Me:  completely perplexed  "Uhhh... I don't think that's such a good idea."    Guy: "Why?"    Me:  so nervous I lie : "Well, I just got out of something, and I think I need some time to work on myself."    Guy: "What did this guy do to you? I mean we can be friends, you know. You can have friends. I don't even live here, but I'll drive here for you."    Me: "Yeah I just don't think it's a good idea."    Guy: "Can't I just call you?"    It kept going on and I didn't know what to do! My head was in my hands and I was like "Fine take my fucking number" and gave it to him. I was going to make one up, but I felt so bad. Then he was like "I can feed you and that dude." NO, live me alone! So I walked back over to Luke looking down, cause that guy kept staring and motioning for him to get us food or something, and Luke asked what was wrong, but I said nothing. So then we started to get people to sign the petition. Four hours later... it was so god damn hot. We started to head back to get picked up and James joined us. That kid is so funny. Luke was pissed cause he was 3 signatures less than 50. James asked me how many I got and I told him 40. He was really impressed and Luke asked how many I got and when I told him his eyes got so big. They were like, "That's really good for your first day!" I was pretty proud of myself. So as we were walking back, James kept going on about how he hates Ohio and how black people don't take care of each other here the way they do in Georgia. Then he was saying he's never lived in a more racist place, and I was like, "You're from the South!" I told him I went to CSG and he goes, "My mom tried to sign me up there. No, I'm not kidding. I don't do well around guys." Then he started freaking out about jay walking again and started to walk in the crosswalk when it said "Don't Walk". I told him, "I really don't think it's jay walking if you are in the crosswalk." Then we started talking about girls in NYC. James was like, "They have the finest lookin Dominican women there. Every girl's got a J. Lo booty!" Luke asked me if I was Dominican, no no I'm not anything but English, Czech, and Indian DAMNIT! James goes, "My baby's mama is a beautiful Dominican girl." Then he talked about how his father and brother were in the Crips and how he NEVER wears red and all that. James is a funny, funny guy. There were all these Pro-Life people, so in the car Luke goes, "There's pro-choice and pro-life, why don't they make a category where they kill all the babies?!" I thought that was funny, actually. Then we went back to the headquarters and did these time&nbsp;sheets thing. They were long and hard. Stephen gave me a huge hug when I got back. As I've told Anna, my three rules are: 1. Don't touch me. 2. Don't talk to me. and 3. Get the FUCK away from me. But all of these people were nice, so it was okay. Everyone was impressed with my 40 people. Stephen has the worst laugh I've ever heard, it's 350 times worse than mine. Yep, that bad. I signed up to work during the Working Title concert, since I'm going anyways, and I get in for FREE! Since Luke was my coach guy, he kept trying to give me advise: "You just gotta keep your head held high. I mean, people are jerks, but don't worry, okay?" I was like, "I'm really okay." So I finally left and I was like, "Thanks for all the help, Luke." And he starts waving and is like, "No problem, bye! Have a good day!" Dude, it's 5:30, the day is over.     I babysat this morning. I don't know if anything else is going on. Oh, Anna got an interview with Patrick from Limbeck when we go to see Maxeen in Cleveland. That's super exciting- she loves that kid. I just really love Tom Bailey- he's beautiful. That's about it. BYE!

      anelke3: what is this thing about a birthday party tomorrow? browntrash182: who invited you? anelke3: margaret. browntrash182: yeah that wasn't an open invitation.  Anyways, so I walked to the library. I was like Dora the freaking Exploradora! I hate that girl! I like Maggie and the Ferocious Beast- GREAT GOOGLEY MOOGLEY! Last night I had this really scary dream. I was Harry Potter and I was dueling with Voldemort in the backyard of the pets that I'm watching. I kept wanting to just give up, so I could go and be with Sirius and my parents, but I knew that if I died Voldemort could come back fully to power, because the prophecy says that only one of us can live. I had to keep fighting, but I was so mad at Dumbledore for lying to me that I just wanted to hand in the towel. And my guilt for Sirius' death was really bad. It was an INTENSE dream!

      I'm tired as shit. I don't even know what's going on. I don't know what I've done lately or what the last thing I wrote about was. All I remember is that the Incubus concert was on Saturday. They probably are the best performers I've seen. They put on a real show, and it's sad that I only say that because they actually played longer than an hour! GO THEM! Brandon Boyd took off his shirt. Every boy that plays guitar must do it without his shirt on! There was this horrible man shouting out rude things. He was so ugly and evil, he should just go to Iraq. He had the haircut. All I do is babysit. And every time I babysit, it is always bad and weird, why is that? Yesterday I babysat, well first I went to let out the pets I'm watching at like 8 AM, then babysat from 8:30-12. Then I went back to let the pets out and stayed with them. Then I babysat from 2:30-9:30. Then I went back and let the pets out again. But let's just talk about that second babysitting gig. It was for Sophia, but her mom's friend was in town with her two kids. Anyways, they have no sidewalk at the moment, so I had to cross the flower bed. I see one of the new kids, but I went inside. They tell me that the one inside is named Emma. I was about to ask about the one outside, "What is his name?" But they told me the other one's name is Sarah. Okay- first problem, I thought that kid was a boy. When they were eating dinner: Sarah: "Do you think I'm a boy or a girl?" Me  nervously : "A girl." Emma: "Well, people at school thinks she's a boy!" Sarah: "Emma, everybody here knows I'm a girl, but it's complicated..." COmplicated.. I do NOT have the emotional capacity to help you figure out your gender issues kid. Seriously, don't mess with me. Then we walked to Dairy Queen, yeah the one at Indianola and Arcadia, the one where if you walk two feet you are in the road. I thought I was going to have a heart attack with these three kids running around. This really dirty man riding a bike kept laughing at how I was freaking out and muttering under my breath. Actually, he was kind of hot, in that dirty, you ride-around-town-all-day-long-where-are-you-really-going kind of way. Sophia's cone was dripping EVERYWHERE, and I had to hold it, of course. I kept wrapping napkins around it, but they were all dirty. I was like, "God damn this turnicate!" I thought it was funny. YOu had to be there. Anyways, Sarah got like five different ice creams cause she didn't like anything- fucker. She asked me about the sports I play, when I promptly told her that I'm more of an "activist than an athlete" but I told her I used to play field hockey, which she scowled at. She went on about cricket (or something), and lacrosse, and rugby- WHO THE HELL PLAYS RUGBY IN THE U.S., LET ALONE AN 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL?! When we were watching TV, and by "we" I mean "them" because I am Anti-Hillary Duff, so I DO NOT watch her show. Sarah seemed to like her. I said that she was rumored to be dating a 25-year-old and she was like, "NO, YOU'RE WRONG!" Okay, sorry to burst someone's bubble. Actually, you know, that kid seemed to be going through a lot, and that's rough at 8 years old, poor thing. Nobody went to bed, I told Sarah and Emma to NOT go into Sophia's room, but they did. I hate them, go back to Connecticut, the land of evil. BYE. BUT THEN: dog sitting, that can't be bad, can it? YES IT CAN!I get there and notice that the basement lights are on. I let the dog out then go inside to feed them. I grab her bowl, but it's full of dog food. It was empty when I was there in the afternoon. I look over and the front door is open. I hear this man talking. I'm thinking, okay maybe it's Jenny's boyfriend. So I called out but nobody answered. It seemed like it was coming from a bedroom, but everything was so dark, I was too scared to turn on a light and find a man, possibly dead, lying there. So, I freaked out and left. Why can't anything be normal for me?  FUnny story: We've been taking stuff to this resale store. I was carrying this heavy lamp and here's how it goes down: Lady 1: "You may want to take that to the furniture store. It'll sell faster there." Lady 2: "Oh no, it's so cluttered, nobody would ever see it!" Lady 1: "Well Sarah said that it was really nice." Lady 2: "Are you sure?" My mom: "So should we take it there? Or do you think we should try and sell it here." Lady 1: "I don't know." ME: "Well, can you make up your mind, cause this thing is HEAVY!" AHH I'M SUCH A BITCH!  I feel like going on a walk. I think I'll walk up to the Library with a canvas bag to fill with books. Can I be any more pathetic?

      So, I'm kind of in a bad mood. I don't know why. I think it's cause I didn't get much sleep and had to babysit this morning at 9 am. I shudder. Anyways, I was mean to the kids. Well, just the boy. He kept touching me, I mean I know he's three and he is just a kid, but keep your disgusting paws off of me! Then he started rubbing my thigh, I grabbed his hand and knocked it off of me. We were watching that fucker Dora, by the way I really think there is something wrong with her eyes, anyways he was lying on the couch and putting his dirty feet on me- IT WAS SO OBNOXIOUS. And the little girl was screaming and constantly eating cheerios, which everyone knows I hate because that's what I think kids smell like - crusty old cheerios. They're gross. But I got $50 for yesterday and today. That's not too bad. Doug is working in the house. I came home and the garage and gate were shut. So I assumed he did it, even though his car wasn't around. I walked into the house and he had left all the lights on and the radio on. Doug, turn that stuff off! The radio, by the way, was from MY bedroom! Doug there is one sitting in the kitchen! Oh well. I saw he left a big beer can sitting on the table, I'm surprised he didn't take it with him when he went to go get whatever he was going to get. I'm really mean. Don't know why. I leave you with this odd moment from Texas, I don't believe I shared. When we were driving in Tennessee I saw a man in the next truck drinking from a bottle in a brown bag. Yes, he was drinking and driving. We tried to get around and past him, you know, cause we didn't want to die. Anyways, we were listening to Taking Back Sunday and it was on the part when he goes, "You're a lush" and we were pulling right alongside the car and I look over at the man drinking, and then the CD skips and it's going, "You're a lush-lush-lush-lush" It was classic!

      This made me laugh very hard. It is a pronunciation guide for those of you who are not familiar with terms related to Columbus, Ohio. Enjoy.  BELLEFONTAINE--On many occasions I have heard this one said "Belluhfontayne" as if the person was trying to say each letter. However, people living there assure me it's BELLFOUNTAIN, like the word "bell" and the word "fountain" pronounced as one. BUCYRUS--I was downtown once and I was asked how to get to Buckeyruss. Buckeyruss? I thought for a minute and realized they meant Bew-SIGH-russ, the small town in north central Ohio. CHILLICOTHE--Ever heard of Chilcote? Someone told me they had been there once. Except it's pronounced CHILL-uh-COTH-ee. COLUMBUS--This one's easy enough, Co-LUM-bus. But if you want to sound like a real Columbusite, you have to say KLUMbus, as in "Gee, ain't it great here in KLUMbus?" GAHANNA--No, it's not the African nation of Ghana, it's Guh-HAN-uh. INDIANOLA--Someone once told me they lived on Indyola St. near campus. "Indyola" sounds like it belongs in Indianapolis. Try INDIAN-ola, which I understand is named for some long-gone Indian mounds. JAEGER STREET--"JAY-grrr" would seem to be the correct pronunciation for this German Village street. But it's actually YAY-grrr. Hey, it was settled by Germans, so what do you expect? KINNIKINNICK--Someone once asked me if I had ever attended the Tecumseh! outdoor drama near Chillicothe, located by a small town called Nick-nick. Nick-nick? Wasn't that what Latka Gravas called making love on the old Taxi show? It's pronounced KINNY-kinn-ick, just like it's spelled. KIOUSVILLE--When I first moved here I thought this small Madison county town was "Cuesville", like a place where pool cues live. But locals insist it's KYES-ville, rhyming with "eyes". LANCASTER--You may be saying, "Gee, that's LAN-CASS-ter", that's an easy one. In most places you'd be right, but for unknown reasons it's LANK-uh-ster here. MARCONI BLVD.--I was once asked directions to Macaroni Boulevard. Huh? Oh, you mean Mar-KOH-nee, you know, like the guy who invented radio. NEWARK--Yup, it's pronounced NEW-erk just like the one in New Jersey. But if you want to sound like you're from there, say NERK. OLENTANGY--A lot of visitors say the river and the street as OHL-en-TANG-ee, like the river tastes tangy. In fact it's OHL-en-TANJ-ee, rhyming with the word "tangible". PATASKALA--Nope, it's not "PATT-uh-SKALL-uh", it's Puh-TASS-kuh-luh. PHILLIPI ROAD--An old girlfriend of mine was in town and she referred to Phil-IP-pee Road. It was all I could do to keep from cracking up laughing; it is pronounced PHIL-ih-PIE. RIFFE BUILDING--The Vernal Riffe Building, named for a former long-time state senator, isn't pronounced "Riff"; it's RYFFE (a long "i" in the middle). SCIOTO--The same former girlfriend referred to the SKEE-oto River. Both the river and the street are pronounced SIGH-oh-toe, another Indian name. SENSENBRENNER--I recently heard someone refer to Senseybrunner Park downtown. Senseybrunner? Just sound it out: SEN-sen-BREN-ner. It's a former mayor. SULLIVANT--At first glance it may look Lucas Sullivan or Sullivan Avenue, but it's SullivanT, Sullivan with a T, named after Lucas Sullivant, founder of Franklinton that is now the near west side of Columbus.

      Today has been pretty boring. I woke up around noon, but no complaints there. I read some  Harry Potter  throughout the day, only to be yelled at 1,000 times by my mom, because I wasn't helping her clean. I managed to get out of cleaning pretty much all day. I just cleaned her car, that was my only contribution. My mom and I planned a college visiting trip to see Purdue and DePaul in Chicago. I hope that goes through. But I also want to see Drexel in Philly and University of Maryland- and my mom says if my dad will pay for it, I can just fly there and go by myself! Isn't that crazy?! I would have a nice time by myself.  I went to CVS to use my coupon for 50 digital pictures for $10, it took me like an hour. Some hick in front of me couldn't use the machine, and ooh it was stressful. I developed this old picture of me and Erica in Stratford, and the lady goes, "Oh are you related?" I thought she was kidding so I was laughing and saying no. Then she goes, "But you have the same smile!" I still thought she was kidding, but then this other woman, who hadn't seen the picture, asked if we looked alike, and the lady goes "Yeah, they do." But there was no sarcasm to her voice. I think she was serious- what an idiot! I got really random pictures developed.  Earlier I watched Best Month Ever on VH1- it was just all the best parts of Best Week Ever compiled into one show, but it was still so funny! That's like my favorite show, along with Last Comic Standing, I love to laugh! Did you know there is a Best Week Ever blog? It's great... http://bestweekever.vh1.com/  But eww they're saying that Hillary Duff and Joel from GC are dating! That's so gross, I'm going to find him at Warped Tour and call him out as the white trash perv he is- trust me I have no fear of that piece of ass. It's horrible, but I never plan on using violence against another human being, just the power of my words to show them that they are nothing and stupid and have no purpose on this Earth, and that I am their queen. WHAHAHA. I also watched Stevo 32 from Sum 41 on Cribs. He is really funny. Deryck was there eating a hot dog- my two favorite foods: Deryck Whibley and hot dogs. NUM NUMS! At one point Stevo goes, "Here's my boy: Bob Barker!" and it scans to an autographed picture of Bob- I loved that show! Dave Brownsound and Cone were there too- I really miss them/will never see them live. Maybe one day. As I've said, Carrot Top is our link to blink. Now I'm just rambling. But you guys- Lizzie showed me this great interview with Tom DeLonge about his support for Kerry and all that- it was so hot. I'm super attracted to boys who are involved (aka that kid I've talked about, even though he's blonde) and I want to help out too, it's really important! So go out there ladies and be political, that's all I have to say.

      So I've been quite busy over the past few days. Let's see.... Friday was Red, White & Boom. Lizzie, Erica, and I went to the garage rooftop at Mount Carmel. First, I stepped in gum, and it stuck to twigs and rocks and annoyed me. Then we ate some hot dogs, and they were pretty good. We played with a deck of cards, and Elizabeth does NOT know how to play Speed. Instead of just accepting her different way, I threw a fit. It was so childish, but I could just not accept such a terrible way to play. Okay, what do you think? The object of Speed is to put the card higher or lower on top of the already existing card, so you shouldn't be able to put down doubles, right? Like if it was a 4, you can't be able to put down two 5's- that's just crazy, right? Anyways, then we got our faces painted. I got a cat and we all got lightning bolts Harry Potter style. But, my mom said they looked like the Elvis lightning bolt, oh well. When we got back to our table, we saw Chelsea! It was so exciting! We proceeded to hang out with her the rest of the night. I told her about the blink concert, even though I already had. Then we went and played with chalk. Major karma. I wrote a bad word, then got something in my eye. I cursed the song "Proud to be an American" and then noticed that an imprint of a chalk American Flag was branded on my shirt. God was smiting me. Ooops. I dared Erica to flirt with this cop and she did. And by cop, I mean cop/fireman. He was pretty cute. We went to use the nice bathroom, by using my mom's badge. When we were leaving, I saw this cop and told him, "We have a badge, it's cool." He really didn't even care what we were doing. We saw a baby pug, Erica took a picture, and the kid stared at us like we were freaks. The fireworks were WEAK. But it was still fun. On our way home we realized that the cop that pulled over Elizabeth was actually Erica's cousin. Odd, I know. We watched some movies back at mi casa,  Identity  and  Clue , to be exact, then we went to bed.  I was super tired on Saturday. I started the third movie we didn't watch,  Mystic River . Then I went to see  Spider-Man 2 . It was pretty good, but I just don't get into that series. Then I went to dinner. There was a line, so this boy was holding the door. He stopped me, bent down so he was eye level with my chest, and started to read the words on my Used t-shirt allowed. I was looking down and watching him look, and it was so awkward. After he read all the words, he looked up at me, and then rubbed my back. I couldn't even be mean to him, I was that confused. My mom and I went to see  The Lion King , or as my aunt calls it "The Lion Hunter". The show was amazing! The costumes and the scenery- so impressive. Young Simba was really cute.  I babysat this morning. Damn kids. Then we went to the Doo Dah parade. It wasn't very funny. I sat with Megan Donato, whom I haven't seen since I think sophomore year when I taught her maneuverability. We reminisced about when she told me she had five cats (a lie) and sent me to look for them and when we played with my Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls. There was a group of lesbians in the parade with a "Lesbians Against Bad Bush" sign. It was great! THEN... I saw the boy from the Ohio Democratic Headquarters that told me he didn't have any "personal volunteer options". OOOH I love that kid! I think we are destined to be political lovers. He was marching for Kerry, my kind of man.  We went to lunch with Megan and her mom. It was okay. Then my mom and I went to see her friend's photography exhibit. We searched the house for it, but the rooms kept coming, they never stopped. We finally found his work in the last room, the bathroom with a sheet over the toilet, and amongst the other artist's nature shots, my mother's friend shot pictures of a drag queen. But, they were pretty good. He's doing my senior pictures, by the way. Do you want one?  We went to Lowes to check out paint samples. When we were walking back to the car, my mom dropped them and they took off with the wind. I ran around that place trying to recollect them all!  I put together my letters to send to Carrot Top's people about hooking me up for Senior May Program. It took so long! I printed half of them out with "July 4th, 4004" DAMNIT! Then I wanted to mail them, so nothing could happen, and my mom told me to go down to the mailbox near CVS, since that's the fastest pick up. I drove down, listening to BB Mak (hey, it's my mom's car, and that CD is MINE- damn her stealing my Brits!) and Delilah on Sunny 95 (I'm OBSESSED), only to find that the parking lot was just paved and you couldn't go in. Oh well. That's it. Happy Fourth!

      You know what I hate? When there are two left turn lanes, with a double white line that separates where each car is supposed to go, but the car next to you just turns into your lane anyways. Especially when it's a minivan with bumper stickers saying, "My Kid is on the Honor Roll at Some Urban Piece-of-Shit School in the middle of Nowhere". Why do they do that? Why don't you just kill your precious baby, you ass wipe? I hate minivans! I've been babysitting a lot, it's weird, I have no purpose for my money anymore and I don't know what to do with it. I keep putting it in my "Texas or Bust" fund, which is no longer a fund. P.S. When we were on the trip, I saw a minivan (gag) that had "Texas or Bust" written on its windows-what's up with that? I saw  Fahrenheit 9/11  the other day. So damn good, well I cried a little. Some of those soldiers were ass wipes, and I was pissed off at them. I was talking to Liz about Mae and the whole Dave sounds like Big Bird thing. Then I started to think about Big Bird.  This is a total blonde moment: Me: "Big Bird doesn't even look like a bird!" Liz: "Yes he does!" Me: "No, birds aren't that big." Liz: "Dude, he's BIG bird!"  That was pathetic, I know.   My feet have been smelling really bad lately. I washed them three times while babysitting, because I couldn't take the smell, and yet they still stink. Maybe I'll go wash them again.

      First off: I'm coming home soon, thank you Jesus!  Hmm... oh yeah I went up that Mount Diablo. Well basically you drive for like twenty minutes up the mountain. Not bad, right? FUCK NO...it is the most windy, hilly, horrible road ever! I got a headache on the way up, but I was okay. The view was pretty, but it was hot, and we stayed up there far more than I could have ever wanted. Damn these nature people. We started to head down, oh my god, it was horrible. I felt like SHIT! We had to go to the grocery store to get salmon for dinner, but I had to lie down cause I felt terrible. That night Bob and Candace came over for dinner. Let's just say the adults got a little inebriated (or in-HE-breated) and things turned a little wild and got dirty. One time Bob said to my aunt Sharon, "It tasted like your last boyfriend!" Then he was telling this story about him and his wife camping and running into a bear. Anyways, he was acting out how she was holding this flashlight towards the bear, and by the looks of his hands, it was a big flashlight. So he said, "But she's used to holding big things like this." AWKWARD! I didn't know if I was supposed to act like I knew what they meant or not. Yeah, crazy times with old people. PS this guy is in his mid 60's. Today I visited Berkeley (shut up, I know I have no chance, but my father lives on dream planet, plus I wanted to see the town and stuff) and University of San Francisco. Neither of which I liked very much. Berkeley was fucked up. You don't make appointments, you just go for the tour. Needless to say, it was their biggest tour all summer. I got this horrible tour guide. We walked around for 90 minutes, then they shoved all seven groups into this one teeny tiny classroom for the info session, which was pointless since 10% of their students make up the international and out-of-state kids. BYE. But then I had to find my aunt. Well, I left my cell phone with her and was going to call it from a pay phone. I couldn't find one, so I went back to the visitor's center to see if they had one. The guy pointed me in the right direction, and then I went to make the call. Oh, but it's $4 in change to make a long-distance call, so I was screwed. I tried calling collect, but my phone blocks that. He walked by to go to the restroom and asked me if I had found the phone. I explained my situation to him, and I asked him if I could use the school's phone to make a quick call, even though it was long-distance, but otherwise I'd be stranded. He goes, "Use our phone? Oh, no!" Long story short, I had to use my credit card to make the call, and he comes back like, "Did you figure it out?" YEAH FUCKER, I CHARGED IT. THANKS FOR NOTHING. The school has to make like a thousand phone calls a day, I'm sure they have an excellent phone plan, thanks for making your visitor feel like shit. Screw your school and all the fucked up people in what they call Beserkely. Then we drove up to USF, which was the exact opposite: private, small, Jesuit catholic. One boys mother acted like she knew so much, but she clearly knew nothing about the college process with those questions. This kid came in late and sat behind me, and his father kept talking, shut the fuck up! Then we split the very small group into two smaller ones for our tour. Okay, this was funny as hell. The guide could have cared less about the whole thing. We walked out of a building, and I kind of had my back to the door, waiting for him to walk in front of me. I turned to my right, and saw him walking the other direction, while the rest of the group was standing there with me without a clue that we were supposed to follow him to the right. This girl and her mother kept talking and pestering him. "OMG where are you from in Phoenix. AHH that's where I'm from. Do you like it here? OMG what classes are you taking?!" HEY, HE DOESN'T CARE! He looked just like a newsie, he even had on the hat. Then this HORRIBLE boy, the one that came in late, was so obnoxious I wanted to die. He asked the guide if the gym had all these different machines and weights, and the guide goes, I think his name was Robert, anyways, he goes, "Yeah, I bet we got those!" Then that young boy made some comment about old people, and the other girl's mom yelled at him and he goes, "No malice was intended." Okay, you want to sound smart so you use big words. No, you just sounded stupid trying to say something that simple with big words. Jackass. Oh, and his father was a trip. The boy said something to his mother, who didn't respond, and his dad goes, "Melinda, he was talking to you!" How about Melinda pushed that brat out of her crotch, therefore she'll ignore him any time of the day she wants tubby! Then my aunt Sharon and I drove over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito and then came down to Union Square, where we spent an hour trying to find parking, found a 30-minute meter, and then found all the stores to be closed. Tomorrow we're driving up to Napa Valley. PS she's driving me crazy- but I'll make an entry dedicated to every annoying thing she does later.

      So it's 4:30 in the morning and I was sleeping peacefully, until I heard all this talking and commotion in the street below. Damn kids having fun and me stuck with all the adults. You guys, seriously, I'm going crazy. I was with my mom, then jetted off to spend time with my dad, then came home to deal with my aunt. I cannot take any more adults! The last time I saw a friend was when Anna and I went to see Maxeen in Cleveland. Well, I guess this is a perfect time to blog. Yesterday my aunt and I took the BART (a metro/subway type thing) into San Francisco. We walked around this ferry museum and then headed up to Chinatown. They had some good free stuff. After that we walked to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. That was awesome! Check out their website to see some of their stuff. Then we got on the cable cars/trolley and took it up to Fisherman's Wharf. We took a boat ride along the bay up to Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. It was really cold, and this little boy on the boat had no teeth, but it was a nice view. Before we got on the boat, we saw all these people standing and watching us. We were both wondering what they were doing, and then this man popped out from behind a bush and scared the living daylights out of me! Stupid fuck. We ate dinner around the Wharf. I had a major craving for a hot dog, but instead of ketchup, I put like cocktail sauce or something on my hot dog, so they made me another one. We took a cab back to the BART station. This cab driver was fucking nuts. He never shut up and was going on and on about drugs. Which cities do which drugs, how they do it, where the drugs come from, uhh... who gives a fuck? Maybe you shouldn't take drugs and then drive people around the city a hole. He would swerve out of the lane and go right onto oncoming traffic, and then pull over at the last second. Yeah... but we made it and got back. Today her friends took us on a driving tour. We stopped up at USF, since I don't know where to go on Monday when I take my tour. Then we went around Golden Gate Park and up to Ocean Beach. The Atlantic is way better than the Pacific. The fog was pretty thick, though, so that probably wasn't the ocean's best day. We ventured into this park where you can take really great pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge, but the fog was so thick that you couldn't see one part of the bridge. We did walk on the bridge a little and you couldn't see the sides, so it was pretty scary. Then we drove up to the light house on Coit Island, or something like that, and took pictures. After, we headed down Lombard Street, otherwise known as the Crookedest Street, and yes, it was quite crooked. We came upon this road that literally dropped straight down. Barb was like, "No Al, oh no, Al, omg no!" And he did. He ZOOMED straight down to all our screaming! We then headed to Ghiradelli Square and got lost in the chocolate chaos. Finally, we went up to this Chinese restaurant for dinner and came home. Tomorrow I think we're going up to Mount Diablo, yeah, I could care less about that shit. I miss home.

      Guess what... the people I'm staying with have a computer. Now I will not have to let down my faithful viewers. Okay, my aunt is driving me crazy and I haven't been home in so long that I'm homesick. Yesterday we flew into Dallas (sigh, one day TK, one day) and then we had to take a train to a different terminal and my aunt just could not handle it. We went to Starbucks and, swear to god, this kid kept speaking but I could not understand one word. He was not foreign, okay he was a Texan, but everything he said, I just smiled and nodded. I have not found one understandable human being on this trip. As we were flying to Oakland this man in front of me glared at me, because I was speaking too loudly- I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF AND THE PRESSURE IS INTENSE UP IN THE CLOUDS, JACKASS! We got in around 12 AM their time, 3 AM our time. The place was BUMPIN' and it was annoying. While waiting for our luggage, this horrible, stupid girl kept flirting with this guy and he'd be like, "Is this your bag?" and she'd go, "No hehehehehehehe" for every bag that came before them! I was like, "When I grab my bag, I won't be too careful to NOT hit that bitch." Then we had to wait for the Rental Car Shuttle to take us to the worst rental car company, Dollar/ghetto. Two men: one was on the phone to the Philippines and it's like- hi, Hello...CUSTOMERS. The other was Indian or something and his teeth were messed up so anything he said was not understandable. They were closing right as we got there, fortunately we got our crappy Hyundai. Sharon, my aunt, started driving and the car was sounding horrible... we had the emergency break on. I took over, because legally I'm not allowed to drive (so you are an adult at 18, can drink at 21, but can't rent a car until 25... the US is stupid as shit), but my aunt can't navigate either. The 45 minute drive took us like an hour and a half, that's how bad she is. We rolled up around 2:15...CALIFORNIA TIME, 5:15 Ohio time! I slept on the air mattress, which sucked, so I made my aunt sleep on it tonight/she offered and I didn't refuse that much. Today we hiked along this mountain by their house (eww outdoors not for me, but my aunt is anorexic and freakish about the outdoors, so I went with it) and then went to Walnut Creek's downtown. It was nice. I wanted to buy this diamond ring I saw at Tiffany's- it was hot. We got manicures, too. The best one I've had- seriously she was so precise. Every nail she asked if it looked okay. I got a full hand/arm massage, 5 coats of shit, and it was only $10! If I found a place like that back home, I'd go all the time. Tomorrow we are going into San Francisco. I want to go to the Museum of Modern Art, Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, and take the cable cars and stuff. Okay... cable cars, those are the things at the fair! You know, a car on a CABLE. In San Fran- those are trolleys. Who backs me up on this? Well, maybe I should get some sleep, it's going to be a long day tomorrow. Bye!

       Miss me yet?  SURPRISE! I don't leave for California until tomorrow night. But we are flying through Dallas, ooh the memories, I'll be so close to TK I may just run from the airport to that ghetto Super 6. We'll see each other, and we'll both just feel it, that instant Indian connection of love. In two days time our families will have set up a wedding, and I'll finally get some henna. We will not speak to one another until our wedding night where we will make passionate, kinky, hardcore porn sex all night long. Then we will have 35 kids and reside in a hut outside of Dallas. It's so beautiful. Are you crying yet? My trip was boring. I got to go visit Drexel by myself. There I met this girl who was also alone and followed me around telling me how her father cannot handle her doing anything by herself. She stopped the tour to have pictures taken of everything. So obnoxious. I almost got off the train in NYC... my homeland, except for India. Went to the Rhode Island Zoo and to my favorite place in the world, Watch Hill, which was gorgeous. Then I got in my first fight with my dad, over the size of his coffee. Yeah, don't want to talk about it. My plane to Cincinnati was horrible. The turbulence was so bad, I thought I was going to die and I was really scared. Nobody on the plane seemed to fear anything, and I just wanted to shout, "Don't you people get it! This plane is going to crash and we are all going to DIE!" Good thing I didn't, or I would have been electrocuted and killed right on the spot, just because I'm brown. Then on the next plane this woman talked the entire time. I didn't know if I could put on my headphones, if that would be rude, so I didn't. This boy in front of me was reading Harry Potter, and I really wanted to know where he was at in the book! I kept looking over, and this is so gross, he was chewing gum, but he would pull it out and twist it around his two fingers. YUCK. Happy Birthday, Ann... sorry you are not feeling well. Well ladies and gents, tomorrow I become a California beach bum, NOT. I will always be a hardcore bitch from the East Coast (okay, I will be one day) and I probably will be stoned in California and the Klan will grab me and dye my hair blonde. Hope it looks good!
