      Hi everyone! Today has been a day of extreme happiness but also extreme stress onset. I had an interview at BabyStyle today and by the grace of God I was given the job on the spot. They were very impressed with my personality and although I have NO retail experience, I am so excited to start. I start the new job on Monday but that will be paired with the Library and I will be doing some nannying this summer with Chris. Overall, I will be terribly busy starting um NOW!   I am moving into my new house tomorrow and I am very excited to have some space of my own. I love my roomie for the summer (Lindsey) but I am excited to be out of a dorm room for good. Ideally, everyone loves when they make their transition from dorm room into house and/or apartment at first! I had a great day at work today and I got a nice note from a friend and I love notes from a "friend!" Hope everyone is doing wonderfully and thanks to those of you who were so kind to throw some prayers my way for the job. I appreciate it greatly! Please keep praying so that I learn to manage my time well and also for my move tomorrow. Take care everyone and come back soon!

      Hallelujah! Tonight Pam, Steve, and I moved my bed into the new house in Newport Beach! I was so excited to realize that in a few days that will be my bedroom. I also found out that Richard (my boss) would like me to work part time for the rest of the summer. Now ideally, that would be good news but I have this full time job at the library that I need very badly. I am a little nervous as to how I will be in two places at once. Has anyone seen the new Harry Potter movie? I need what Hermoine had in order to go to all of her classes. I desperately need a time portal!! Can anyone help me? I also have an interview tomorrow at 1:00 at BabyStyle. For those of you who don't know, that is a baby store that sells name brand items for baby! I think it might be the most ridiculous expenditure of money I have ever heard of but I have no problem working there for a good living. This is all good news except for how I am going to manage my time and be at three jobs each day. I got to spend a little time with Chris (kid I am nannying soon) tonight and he is precious. I think he is going to be a lot of fun to be around and totally someone I will enjoy investing in. I have had a really nice week. I got to see my new house up close and personal again, I am moving in a few short days, and got to spend some quality time with one of my favorite men on Earth yesterday! Ideally, life could not be better. Ok, it probably could but I am seriously so content in today, I have to just focus on that. I just took a personality test called the MMPI, for those of you who aren't psych majors, this is a great tool to assess your strongest personality features. Looking forward to seeing the results of that tomorrow in counseling! Thanks for reading today's post and I hope to hear from you all soon. I think this Blog thing is the best idea since I am going to get ready to go into seriously BUSY mode with 3 jobs. Have a great day everyone and I'm praying and loving you all!

      Good Saturday to you everyone. I am having a great day as I got on the scales today and found myself 2 lbs lighter. I am very happy about that and it certainly is paying off to watch what I am eating. I have worked all day today so that I can take Monday and Tuesday off to go and see my friend in Nor. Cal. I am looking forward to it because we are going to San Francisco and Sacramento while I am there. I am also looking forward to some total quality time with my friend who is taking me :) I love that kid!  I am finding myself really growing in friendships lately just simply because they are good for me finally and the unhealthy people are out of my life. I am so glad because it's amazing to be surrounded by good people. I also thought today how awesome it is that I am at this amazing point in my life. I am finally doing what I want to do, when I want to do it, and where I want to do it. Granted I am not quite the rebel that it sounds like I am, but I am certainly the master of my own destiny so to speak!  Last night I took Jaylie to the fair and it was a good time. We rode some rides, had some fair food, and ran into my auto guy JOE! Yes, you heard right. He was working the tent for Auto Club which was interesting. You never know what you might find at the fair. I did after all ask for prayer yesterday to find my husband at the fair. Who knows???!! Just kidding  Overall the fair was a great time and Jaylie and I got some good bonding time together. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would but it could be that the Auto Club thing made my night. I also was able to chat with a good friend last night which was way appreciated and I love talking to friends. This friend is fairly new to me and it is good to start to grow with him.  Today has been really great as I lost the 2 lbs, got to talk to my favorite boy here in Cali, and have worked all day which equals some serious $$! Honestly, not much to report other than the 2 lost lbs which is super big news but have a great weekend everyone and tune in tomorrow for more excitement (as usual) ~Shalom~

      Happy Friday everyone! I hope your week has been spectacular. Mine is far from over as I am coming into work on Saturday and Sunday for 8 hours each in order to make up time for next week as I am going out of town. Tonight is the big night. I am taking my mentor girl (Jaylie) to the Orange County Fair. This isn't the same as an Indiana fair. If you are from anywhere other than Indiana, an Indiana fair includes the following; pie contests, ACDC songs, the Gravitron, and mullets. Here in Southern California you might get a mullet or two but they are most defintely not from Orange County! Orange County, Indiana (right by my county of Lawrence) is very redneck and here...not so much.  I am feeling mixed on taking Jaylie to the fair. I am getting so old that I can't even tell you. I have no idea what the fun ever was in a fair other than the food any more. I remember that I liked a funnel cake, hot dogs, grilled corn, fried snickers etc... but those things are off limits to me now so I guess it's the livestock for me. I have seen plenty of that growing up in Indiana. Doesn't everyone love that farm on Hancock Avenue right in the middle of town. I mean, we saw cows going to lunch from school. Life is funny in Indiana ...that's what I have decided.  Things here are going pretty well. I am trying to get myself on my feet financially right now and that's proving to be quite a feat. I had an interview today with a job finding agency to see if I can find a clerical position in my area that wants someone part time. I took a bunch of tests to see what I am good at and apparently clerical is what I do. I type really well and so it looks like receptionist positions or data entry are it. They pay pretty well here though and that's good. Please pray that I get a job soon though because I am getting nervous for certain!  This week I have learned a lot about what I need in friends. Do you ever do an inventory of who you allow in your life and wonder what on Earth you were thinking. There are times in your life where you are extremely lonely and you forget what you require in a friend much less a partner. I have wasted some serious time and energy lately on people who are just foul. I have decided no more of that. I don't need it! Then I have these amazing friends who God has clearly decided I deserved when I didn't. I love my friends! You all are such a blessing to me. This weekend I get to spend time with 2 of my dearest and I am so excited about that.  I miss you Indiana folks! I think you should know that! I love you all very much and I need to close this post for the day as I have some more things to do before picking Jaylie up. Please pray that I can find a husband at the fair. I have always wanted to  marry a carnie! HA HA (totally joking ya'll) Love you all and ~Shalom~

      Last night I got a quote on car insurance from Auto Club and it's the best quote I have ever gotten. I got to meet this great guy that works there named JOE! It was a lot of fun so I just had to tell you all because who knows what could progress out of this little "quote." I also should note that Joe got me a rate for $1,000 less than another leading company. :) You gotta love that guy!  Today has been fun. I went to my first meeting of Floor Moms. I am doing this program at Vanguard called "Floor Moms" where you help new Freshmen to feel welcome and just be there for them. It's a great ministry and I am working on a great team of Pam, Judy, Heather, Mary, and I. It will be so much fun with that team!   Also, I got called for an interview today for a receptionist job which is better for my health. I have the interview at 10:00 tomorrow morning so I defintely need prayers as soon as possible. I am very much hoping that something works out soon as I need a job soon with the library position ending on August 24th. I am not worrying though because God takes care of me. I am just praying for the right job to come along and for me to see it coming!  Today I experienced moderate saddness about not being in college anymore. That was an interesting feeling for me because well, I haven't felt it yet. I graduated in May and I have been nothing but exhuberent that I don't have homework, classes, roommates, etc... Now is a different story though. I walked into a Vanguard classroom for a meeting and my eyes got a little misty with thoughts of not "belonging" here anymore. I was mega sad!  Here is another gripe right now. I miss my people. I haven't spent time with one of my favorite boys in 2 years and now I am missing another one! OH well..I'll shut up now!  Well, that's it for today folks. Have a great day and ~Shalom~  &nbsp;

      How funny is this story? This morning I was awakened by a friend at 7:00 a.m. Now, it happened to be my current favorite boy so I wasn't so sad about it but welcomed his sweet voice in the morning hours. We had a nice leisurely morning talk about cell phones, dogs, and piano while he played in the background. (my life sounds remarkably romantic but I assure you, it's not) We got off the phone because I needed to get ready to head to work. I began to get dressed and in the middle of that process I was rudely interrupted by one of our housekeepers,*THE MALE ONE*, entering my room to clean.&nbsp; He was able to see the "naked nanny" for certain. I was so embarassed but he didn't seem that embarassed. I then had to continue getting ready and head to the kitchen for some breakfast (which I took "to go" after that episode) and met him again face to face. I was pretty embarassed. I have no idea what he uttered upon walking in on me because he didn't speak English. So that was my morning.  This afternoon has been better as I have been in a safe zone at good old Vanguard Library. Most of you know that I have been somewhat thrown into financial upheavel recently and I solved another portion of that today. I was really proud of myself for how I am handling things lately. Now, that being said I have barely enough to live on but my bills are getting paid and that's important. I am still in need of another job so keep praying about that.  I am so excited because on Sunday I&nbsp;am heading to Northern California to see Heather. Heather is my last year college roomie and one of my nearest and dearest girls. I am going with one of my favorite boys because he is originally from up north and is going to drop me off on his way. I am very happy that I am not only getting to see Heather but spending some time with him on the ride up and back. My life is full of very wonderful people right now and I am so lucky to have the group of friends that I have.   A lot of times I think of how I am going to be 24 soon, (11 days actually) and I think of how I am not married, don't have kids, don't have anyone *yet*&nbsp;romantically special to me, etc...and I begin to get sad. Well, these are the times when I realize my life is incredibly full. I have a relationship with God that is real and serious. I have great friends in Indiana and California who I keep good solid relationships with. I have family *some* who love me and pray for me. Most of all, I have my health *mental and physical*. I have been released from all things unhealthy and finally have my life together. If being in a relationship means that you have to disregard your personal emotional health, it is completely not worth it. Today is a day where I thank God from saving me from the daggers of divorce. It could have been and I am so glad it isn't!   Well, I should close today's post as it has all been said. Oh yeah, I am so happy because this Friday I am taking Jaylie to the Orange County Fair. It's a really great fair and I am excited to take her and see her have some fun and to have some time with her again. Thanks for stopping in everyone. I love you all dearly and ~Shalom~

      Today I did something I literally haven't done in 6 years. I had professional pictures taken. Now, when I say professional pictures, I mean Sears Portrait Studio. I just haven't had pictures taken in a long time and thought since I have lost 104 lbs it would be good to get some new pics. They aren't wonderful but they were so much fun to get taken. I will upload some onto the web-page which will be fun. They are funny. I actually got to wear a red firemen hat which was super great. You all know that I am crazy as it is and the person who was taking my photos felt it necessary that my personality would fit well with the firemen deal! :) It was great!  I have had an ok day. The major crisis that came down this week is now solved. Now, this has repercussions that are going to last for some time but overall the major problem is solved as of today. I am really glad it's over with for the most part. I am healing slowly from the situation and seriously am so glad that God came through with all the help he did through someone who loves me :)  The weight loss thing is hard but going well. I weigh in every Saturday so I make myself stay away from the scale during the week and just eat well and exercise. I am trying really hard and I want it more than anything so I figure it's time to get 'er done! ;)   My major goals right now are to get to my goal weight, be financially independent and take care of myself, and to find a grad school to go to and get in. I really want to go to Vanguard but we'll see. Please also pray that&nbsp;I find a job soon that I can handle. I am going to see about the surrounding libraries in Southern California since I have a lot of experience there and it would be ideal for grad school. Keep praying everyone! Today has been an ok day. If any of you know me really well you know that today and tomorrow are hard days for me on the calendar. If you can just pray that my heart deals well with them this year as they are harder with new things in my life.  Thanks for your prayers everyone and have a great day and please let me know how you all are doing! ~Shalom~

      Hi everyone. I would love to say that this post will be more fun and happy but seriously, I have had a horrible day already. I had a very big trauma happen on Saturday that has spilled over into the weekend and today. I have been fighting this problem and will still be through tomorrow. Do you ever just wonder "when will it end?" I am wondering that on a moment to moment basis right now. I am seriously overwhelmed.   A week or so ago I had a very hard time physically and since then I have really been trying to take care of myself in the physical health aspect. These last couple of days it has become apparent why I needed to do that. I mean, had&nbsp;I let my health go, this could have killed me. There have been moments in the last couple days where I have thought my head might fall off from stress. I don't know if there is an actual ailment where your head falls off from stress but I am pretty sure if it can happen, it will to me. I really am not a pessimistic person but this life...could make me one!  I wish I could go into what's been happening in my life but I would rather not publish it on the internet. If you are that curious, give me a call and we'll talk. There are just some serious crisis matters plaguing my life right now. I would love to just let it go but there are things humanly that have to be done. I am trying very hard to surrender all of my fears, worries, heartache, and stress to God and that's all I can do right now.  I am still healthy and taken care of so God is still on the throne. No matter what happens I just want to make sure and give him my praise and adoration as He truly deserves it. I hope this post lets you all know that things will be ok but I am in deep need of your prayers for stress release and provision. Thanks all and ~Shalom~

      As most of you know, I just graduated with a psychology degree. That being said, I might have had a small emotional outburst tonight for reasons unstated on the internet. There are those days where you think through a lot of things in your life and you wonder why they happened. You wonder sometimes why you invested into someone just to have them leave your life and scars to boot. You wonder why good people suffer and these bad slimy people prosper. You wonder why "when it rains, it pours!" There are these pressing questions that plague me almost daily. Lately I have been trying to be completely self-aware so that I can be healthy emotionally. In my short 24 years (my birthday is&nbsp;2 weeks from tomorrow), I have seen a lot of heartache. I have seen a lot of pain, sorrow, abuse, and torment being inflicted upon people who really didn't have it coming. I wonder&nbsp;why sometimes. I guess those people probably wonder more than I do.   Have you all been able to watch "Extreme Makeover..home edition?" It's absolutely amazing what these people do for people with hard lives. Tonight I was watching it where there are 8 kids and both parents pass away. I wasn't watching in the beginning of the show to find out how BOTH parents died but seriously, I was crying like a baby! It was so sad yet so amazingly wonderful to see their house being redone for them and their joy attached to it. I watched that and contemplated my life 10 years down the road. If all goes according to Erica's Plans..(and it never does) I will be doing therapy for families in that time span. I will be coming across people who hurt the way these 8 children have. I was perplexed that God would call me to such a career and completely make me good at it. I know that sounds completely arrogant and prideful but let's be honest, I am proud of the person God has made me. I can endure listening to anyone's problems and literally feel the things they are feeling. People, that's a blessing ...not a curse. As I watched these children get a house that they don't even have to pay for, I was so happy for them. Deep down I was absolutely estatic for them. Empathy is an interesting feeling to have.   I'm sorry that last paragraph got kind of deep for some of you. (Sorry Josh) ha ha Anyway, I really have had one of those days where you just wonder what it all means. I have this amazing relationship with God these days where I am getting closer to knowing his character and all I can say about that is....He continues to surprise me. He came through for me yesterday through my dad and just blessed me to pieces. I am so happy to be able to see his love for me so clearly. Sometimes it takes this huge tragic thing to happen for you to see how much He goes to bat for you. Again, I am getting kinda deep!   So anyway, did anyone catch the new show on tonight called "The Days." It's this new sitcom where there&nbsp;are 2 parents (still married) and three children in the home. They are approximately 17, 15, and 10 or so. The 17 year old has become pregnant and the mom is also pregnant. The whole show is just about the family dynamic and I tend to like these shows because I start to think psychologically about them but seriously, when did we get so jaded? When did we find it absolutely normal to have children having children! I am 24 and nowhere near the mark to have a child! I am nowhere near being able to adequately care for another human being solely. Wow, that's big stuff. I have no idea how a 17 year old does it and it happens every day. How sad?! All of you from Indiana know this all too well. How many of our friends have kids...multiple kids and aren't even married? Thank God for my close friends who have really done things&nbsp;correctly and fought to make things work. I admire those of you who have children and totally care for them because it takes a giant!   Well, today has been severely deep and weird for me. Sometimes I will randomly become really analytical, inquisitive, and random in my thought patterns. Please excuse this and chalk it up to the salty sea air! Have a great week everyone and ~SHALOM INDEED~

      Have you ever had a day where you literally thought "I would rather poke a pen in my eyeball and swirl it around than deal with this!?" Well, that's been my day. I am still loving life and joyful in the fact that I have a God that loves me and never forsakes me. I had a very awful thing happen today that would be inappropriate to discuss on the internet but just know that it has been a crappy day! Crappy in the sense of EVERYTHING is going wrong. I am happy to report, however, that it is almost 5:30 p.m. my time and things are beginning to look up. I am quite the Pollyanna when it comes to life. I can see that God loves me and takes care of me regardless of what others do but sheesh.....life is crazy today!   The weight loss endeavors took a back seat this morning to a bigger and better crisis. Sometimes I wonder why someone like me (who is low-drama) always is surrounded by drama then I realize, oh yeah, it's who I allow to be drama. A friend of mine is really wise and completely never lets someone get him upset. He doesn't take on the world's problems nor does he allow other people to plague him with stuff. He is just really tough and I am hoping that some of that will come to me and I'll learn it through him and finally be able to just be me and not feel bad about it.   I desperately need to find another job before the end of August so that I can make ends meet when my job at the library ends. Please write me at  urlLink ericak849@aol.com  if you know of anything in my area. I am looking for something that won't be physically exhausting since diabetes has been kicking my rear. I will work as many hours as I need to as long as they aren't exerting beyond what the body can take. I don't care if I have to have 13 jobs tutoring as long as I can make ends meet. I am very determined to be financially independent no matter what that takes.   Everything else is going ok and I am doing really well on my eating habits and exercise habits so far. You can check out my other blogs on my profile which are a food log and exercise log. Fun times! I am really looking forward to taking my mentor girl (Jaylie) to the Orange County Fair next week. I hope she gets to go. I think it will be a blast to go with a kid again. I don't have a lot of funds but hopefully we'll have a good time anyway.   My trip to northern California got postponed at best until next week just due to my car being wrecked and not being repaired yet and my friend who was going to go with me couldn't make it this weekend. Hopefully I get to go and see Heather next week though and her family. I miss my girl and her parents. I am also looking forward to seeing Northern California as a few people I love are from there.   Well, I should get off here and maybe get on with my day. Thanks for listening and ~Shalom~

      Hello everyone! I hope you are all logging on today after having a beautiful day. I have decided that no matter what comes my way, I am determined to find joy in it. So, nothing new about my car today. I haven't heard from my insurance company at all and quite honestly I am not sure even who the fault lies with in the accident. I do know, however, that I can't drive my car at night until I get that headlight fixed. I would encourage any of you who are from Indiana to NOT deal with Farm Bureau insurance because they are completely incompetent. Sad but true   I am working on finding another job that is less physically exhausting than what I have been doing lately. I applied for one at the Government Leader's Prayer Breakfast for an administrative assistant type job. I have sent my resume so please pray that I hear from them for an interview. It would be a great job because it's only 20 hours a week at $15.00 an hour. That is a good supplement to my nanny position.   In other news, today I have been looking for auto insurance out in California. So far I have heard from Geico and they were excellent to me and we'll see what the quote comes out as. I am very excited about actually moving completely out to California. I will be changing my drivers license and plates soon too. I will be a California resident. WOO HOO! Up until now I have been a student out here but retained residence in good ol' Indiana.   This weekend I am going to be trying to get my life a little more organized and set some things in order. I had a really good healthy day yesterday and I am looking forward to seeing the pounds drop off with my new exercise regime. Overall I am trying to get healthy for once.   If you haven't checked out my web-page yet, I would encourage you to do so. I have added a lot of stuff and have worked a little on it each day. It's a fun place to go and just navigate around. There is a new weight loss page with a before and after shot of me, a celebrity of the week, musician of the week, song of the week, and lots of fun stuff to play with. This weekend I will be getting my pictures back from Colorado and they are super fun and I'll load them up on the web-page as soon as I can. You all will get to see my mega-relaxing vacation in Colorado with Josh which I hope you will enjoy! I also took some pics of my new Newport Beach House that will have it's own page as well and you can scout out what my "crib" looks like! Did I just say CRIB?? HA HA   Anyway, I am doing much better everyone and thank you if you are praying for me. I had some much needed time in prayer last night, a healthy eating day, a good work out, and 8 hours of sleep. That is all good stuff for me. Keep praying everyone and thank you so much. Overall prayer requests are for Cavie to get repaired, provision for my mom and sisters in Indiana as they are struggling, and for me to find good insurance in Southern California. Thanks everyone and ~shalom~

      My little sister, Brittany has this thing she says when something goes wrong. She works up her best hick redneck accent and says "I hate my life." I feel like saying that so much today. Today has been an interesting day. Last night was good because my favorite boy-friend Joel changed the oil on my car which was much appreciated and Cavie is acting a lot nicer today. The trouble started today when I had to go and resign from Babystyle. I hated doing it because I made decent money and I really liked it. I really need to make myself a priority right now and that includes eating correctly, exercising normally, and sleeping a little more. I have to think about my health right now because my dad said this and it made sense; "Erica, you won't be any good as a doctor if you are on kidney dialysis 3 times a week!"&nbsp; I have to agree with him. Now for those of you who are confused, I am not going to be&nbsp;a medical doctor but a psychotherapist and that requires me to be a lot healthier. Not only healthier physically but emotionally in my weight loss endeavors.   Let's be honest, I am so blessed to have people in my life who will tell me the truth and not skirt around things. Pam, my favorite library mom, gave it to me straight yesterday and I love her more for being truthful with me. I have great friends and family who are willing to kick me in the rump when I need it. I am sure most of you know that I am a type I diabetic and&nbsp;I really don't take care of it. I went off insulin a while back for monetary reasons and I have been trying to keep the sugar down but not eating is not the way to do that. If I can't keep it down naturally I need to find a way to be back on insulin or at least on oral medication. I have to begin to watch myself diabetically so much because I can be quite the bad diabetic. Overall, I am going to have to make priorities and try to keep them.   Later in the day&nbsp;I had to call my insurance company back home in Indiana to try to handle things with the Cavie's wreck. I spoke with the rudest representative they have who was completely incompetent. She took 2 weeks to contact me for a statement much less handling it. In the mean time, I am driving illegally with one headlight at night when I have to be somewhere. I don't have the money to rent a car or I would. I have no $$ to fix the car and it looks as if it is going to be independent blame. My deductible is $500 which is way more than my wallet can stand to feel. I have too many bills to fix my car presently. I am really bummed about this because Cavie looks so bad. Please pray I can save the money and get Cavie fixed.   Lately I have been working on being a better financial manager but seriously, I need to start being like a friend of mine who I won't mention their name because they might get embarassed. He is the most frugal of all of my friends and seriously uses coupons on everything. I don't believe he pays full price for anything. I could learn a few things from Josh...I mean...him. I love that about him though and he seems to always have everything he needs.   I seriously am going through the largest learning phase of my life. I mean, how much can someone learn about themselves in one year? I am happy to be wiser, single, passionate, driven, goal oriented, and moving up the improvment ladder. Who knows what is next?! Please keep praying everyone for manna or CASH to fall from heaven. I have seen weirder things happen. Well everyone, have a beautiful day and ~Shalom~

      Hi everyone! Today has been a very bad day to say the least. I went to work this morning and passed out from exhaustion. I know that I have been trying to make it look like I am really enjoying 3 jobs but let's be serious, I am tired. I haven't been eating properly in hopes of losing this blasted weight and sleep isn't really in abundance either. I have been really destroying my body and in turn, it quit on me today. I had to quit babystyle in order to fully give my body the things it needs. I am very mad at myself for having to quit but I am trying to be realistic.   I am really hurting right now because I want to be at goal weight. My goal weight is a healthy 125 lbs but from the other blog we all know that I weigh 232 so I have more than 100 lbs to go. This is the most frustrating thing in my life right now. I feel like people would view me differently if I wasn't so overweight. I feel like the one thing I want the most in life right now is not mine because I am not good enough. That is a horrible way to feel. I hate feeling this way when I know in my head that it isn't healthy. I am aware in my head that people like me as a friend because I am worth liking. I know that the beautiful men that I share my life with in friendship know who I am and appreciate it....but.....it doesn't stop me from feeling like my life will be full of guy-friends and nothing more. I am feeling so alone and completely empty.   I know that right now what I need to do is take some time for me and God. I know that I need to sleep and nourish myself and relax but something in me won't allow that. I need the money of having 3 jobs which I no longer have. I need the busy-ness to keep my mind off the lonliness. Please pray for me everyone and realize that this Erica...is a sad one. I really wish I had some great encouraging happy words to share with all of you today but I don't.   Please keep Cavie in prayer because as you all know...I wrecked her and she needs repaired. Also, I am just nervous that she is going&nbsp;to&nbsp;quit on me because it needs serviced and I have no $$! Please keep praying all and I love every one of you! ~Shalom~

      Have you ever woke up in the morning and thought "what is this life all about?" I have thought that today as I returned to my cushy residence in Newport Beach. I am really so happy where I am at and with what I am doing, however, today feels weird. I just came back from seeing Josh today and landed in beautiful Southern California at 6:00 this evening. I really do love it here but relaxing for 5 days in Colorado made me realize that I want so much more for my life. I am longing for so much and I can't put my finger on exactly what it is that I need. I am searching but seriously, I am not sure if I will ever figure it out.  Josh and I ended up having a great last day together. We went to Columbine which was amazing. We actually snuck in because that is the kind of people we are. I am so fascinated with the whole thing and Josh was a little creeped out but completely compliant. He is such a friend. We then had some great lunch at Chilis and I took off for California.  Thanks for such a great time Josh and Family! I totally appreciate it!    &nbsp; Well this is the end of my post tonight and oh yeah, Mark...you're a freak! Have a wonderful day everyone and thanks for reading my depressing rantings! ~Shalom~

      Today is my last full day here in Colorado with Josh. I am not super sad about it because I really do have to get back to California and make some $$! I have really enjoyed my time here with Josh and his friends and family. After posting yesterday Josh came home and we went to Red Rocks which is this place that is a tourist attraction kinda and a concert venue. It is really gorgeous and we took a picture for the web-site.   We then went out with a group of Josh's friends and his parents to this legend in Josh's mind called "Casa Bonita." It's this restaurant/entertainment zone where everything is kinda themed. Josh is very excited about this place so I wouldn't dream of putting it down. It was fun and we were in the room where the magician performs while you eat. It inspired me and I could quite possibly pick up a 4th job in magic.&nbsp; We had a great time and Josh's friends are great. They are way low key like him and I enjoy that.   My favorite friend I have met here of Josh's is defintely Dan. Dan is mexican so obviously he is really attractive but that has little to do with why I enjoy him. He is completely like Josh so again, just an easy guy to like. He is really funny and completely low key so it was fun to hang with him and the others. &nbsp; After our "Casa Bonita" experience, we met up with another one of Josh's friends (Caleb). Caleb seemed really cool too and brought the girl he is dating. We decided to rent a video and chill at Dan's house for the rest of the evening. We rented 187 which is this movie with Samuel L. Jackson where he teaches at a inner city school and it's really kinda freaky but I liked it. Josh and I just kinda hung out all night but Josh slept through the movie. SURPRISE SURPRISE! &nbsp;   We got home really late so we decided to just go to bed when we got in. Today Josh has to work until 4:00 so I have just been chillin at his house all morning. This evening we are having the legend of all legends...Randy's Steaks. Randy is Josh's dad and apparently he makes the best steak ever. I am excited since I am a proclaimed beef eater. I have no idea what else is on the agenda for tonight but I think we are hanging out with Josh's friends again. Tomorrow before I take off for Cali we are going to Columbine which is of course the moment I have been waiting for. &nbsp; Overall this has been a great vacation and very relaxing. My only sad statement is that I have eaten so much since I have been here. I haven't gained any weight but I certainly haven't lost any. I spend a lot of time just sleeping and relaxing but those of you who really know me, know that I needed that. Wednesday I am back to the world of 3 jobs so this relaxing has to carry me through. By the way, it's almost my 24th birthday! Pretty exciting! &nbsp;   Well, I should close the post for the day and maybe get dressed. It's 2:15 here and I am seriously in my pajamas. I told you he relaxes me! Have a great day everyone and I'll see you all soon! ~Shalom~

      Here I am again. Another day in Colorado where everything is absolutely relaxing. Can I tell you how I have slept about 4,000 hours since being here. Josh makes me tired I think. Yesterday was absolutely amazing. I went up to the Rockies with Josh's parents. We had SUCH a good time. I saw some real life Elk. Now that is a big deal for me since I am Erica Lea King (ELK). I was so excited to be that close to my own animal. I also was able to pick up some fun souvenirs for those I love. Josh had to work so I didn't see much of him yesterday except for Breakfast. He got home last night&nbsp;at about 10:00 though and we went for a walk and talked and watched some stupid tv show that was really brainless. Oh well, exactly why he relaxes me.  &nbsp; Today has been a fun day as well. Josh is working right now until 5:30 but I was able to drive Josh's parents truck and go to the mall here. Now everyone knows that is the main thing for me to check out when going anywhere. There is this great mall here that carries everything I love. I went to Lane Bryant and spent a small fortune and got a really cute shirt for my lil sis at Hot Topic&nbsp;that says "Your mom has a mullet!" I thought it was great and Britt was way excited too. Overall things have been so fun and Josh and I are really growing in our friendship. I can tell that we are just becoming better and better friends as the days pass. It's always easier to really know someone when you see where they are from and who has raised them.  &nbsp; I have found that Josh was raised absolutely wonderfully since being here. His family are the kindest people ever! They are all so nice and loving and really taught Josh how to love and know who he is. I really wanted to write in this blog one of the things I really admire about Josh. Josh knows exactly who he is and NEVER apologizes for it. I have that same quality of not apologizing for the woman that I am and Josh is just proud of who he is. I love that about him. I have more fun with him knowing that he is certain of what is going on in his heart and head. If there is anything that I have learned in my adventure to Colorado, it is that Josh's friendship is not a mistake. He is one of the best decisions I have ever made!&nbsp; Thanks so much Josh for being you and truly being someone I am proud to call a friend. I hope I can always be there for you if you need me!  &nbsp; I am really excited to get back and add my new pictures of Colorado to my web-site. I took a picture of Josh this morning when he was all ready for work because he looks moderately attractive (ha ha) and it will be a part of my Josh page on my web-site. I also am going to take a picture of Josh and I tonight so we have something to keep from the trip and frame. Of course that will also go on the web-site. Well, make sure and stop in to EricaLand and see everything coming soon. When I get back to California, I have to work a lot so it will be a little work on the web-site each day. Have a great day everyone and thanks for your prayers. My trip has already been a blast just because of Josh quality time. ~Shalom~

      Hey everyone! I hope you are all doing great. I am having a ton of fun with Josh and his indoor soccer hotties! I went to watch him play indoor last night and that was an experience. Let's be serious, there was a hot mexican man who made direct eye contact with me over an order of Wendy's chicken nuggets! He can't really speak English but I figure he only needs to know how to say my name to have a fun time. (j/k) &nbsp; Josh is a fun host and we actually ended up riding home in the back of a jeep with no windows where I was literally freezing to death! We were having to talk rather loud in order to&nbsp;have a conversation&nbsp;but as usual Josh and I had a great talk even there.&nbsp; We ended up having to take a big fat walk when we got home because I am eating whatever Josh eats and that is usually something saturated with fat and rolled in sugar. I can't stand to gain any more pounds so that's bad news for me. I am forcing Josh to keep me accountable to exercise and if you have ever seen Josh walk, he walks way faster than I do so I have to keep up which makes the heart rate move!  &nbsp; We are having a super-great time and we are learning a lot about the opposite gender just by hanging out. He is this amazing friend that I can say literally anything to so life is good! I am so grateful to Josh and his family for having me. It's so relaxing which is good. I called work today and got my schedule and when I get back, it's work work work...until I pass out. It's good I am getting this vacation.  &nbsp; Well, I should close this post as Josh and I are going to watch "The Sandlot." I have never seen it so Josh insists that I must now! Have a great day everyone and a big fat ~Shalom~

      So here I am in Josh's house in Colorado. It's so much fun to be able to see and hang out with Josh. He and I have such a fun time being the judgmental people that we are. It's amazing how you can know someone who is the male version of you. The trip so far is going really well. I had a great and safe plane ride. I had to switch planes in Pheonix. It was not too bad as I only had about an hour layover. The weirdest thing happened from Pheonix to Denver though. I was riding in the plane minding my own business when&nbsp;a (very attractive) guy began asking me personal questions like "How old are you?" and "Where did you graduate college from?" Well, I answered Vanguard just to find out that he was&nbsp;a youth pastor in the Pheonix area who also is a Vanguard Alum. Isn't the world a small place?!  &nbsp; I got to Denver at around 4:00 (their time) and Josh was covered in paint from doing a job painting earlier in the day. I figured out the airport rather quickly and we came back to Josh's house. It's really nice and totally comfortable to stay in. He has this adorable dog (Winston) who really is the chubbiest and cutest thing I have ever seen. (That was true until he woke me up this morning) HA HA &nbsp; Josh and I went out for dinner at this amazing place that is also in Indiana called Fazzoli's. It's fast food Italian and it's so good. They have unlimited free breadsticks and I always eat baked ziti. It's sooooo good!&nbsp; Josh always knows how I love to eat! Later on we decided to go to a movie with Josh's friend (may I add here that this guy is beautiful) Dan! We went to see Spiderman2 and it was a decent movie except I can't speak for the 10 minutes that I literally slept because I was so tired. Josh ended up waking me up though and I watched the rest. Not a bad movie at all!  &nbsp; Today Josh has to work for a little bit so I am "Home Alone." HA HA I decided I would blog rather quickly and log my first day in the beautiful state of Colorado. I am really happy because I was hoping it would rain while I was here. For those of you that don't understand this, it's because it NEVER rains in Southern California and I miss the rain. It rained last night so I was happy and the air smelled so clean! I have no idea what Josh and I are doing tonight other than I am watching him play indoor soccer. You all know (most likely) that I love to watch soccer. It's the socks!  &nbsp; By the way, I should note that I had a special boy call me last night and that was fun. He wanted to know when we could "see" each other?! I was pretty stoked. Oh well, for today, I am just enjoying quiet, solitude, no drama, and total fun in the land of Josh McCall. I love my guy friends! Have a great day everyone and Josh, if you are reading this....I love you and your hospitality! ~Shalom~

      Hi everyone. This will be my last post for a little bit because I leave tomorrow morning for Colorado. I am so excited to see Josh and have a little vacation before breaking back into the 3 job world. I miss my favorite Josh so much and I can't wait to spend some much needed quality time with him. I love my guy friends so much and use them as a template of what I would want in a man. They each have a few of the characteristics, but none that match completely yet.   BabyStyle is good and things are panning out as I thought they would. I am totally doing great at it and learning the ropes more daily. I really like it as it keeps me busy and I am losing a lot of weight working there. I am also making a good deal of money since I get about 32 hours a week there. I am missing the library quite a bit just because I only get a few hours a day there but I am going to make time to see my favorite library workers!   Life is good other than that. The love thing didn't pan out but seriously, it's better than ok. I am completely fine with God wanting his best for me and nothing less. I have faith that God loves me so much and has this amazing man picked out for me who is everything I would want and MORE! I have to believe that because I don't have time or the heart to look for him. Thank God for friends in the mean time!   Well, I should get going as I need to start packing for my very exciting trip tomorrow but have a great day everyone and thanks for stopping in. ~Shalom~

      Have you ever come to a point where you realize that you are the luckiest person in the world no matter what you are missing? I am there today. I have found so much to be happy about. I am doing great at my jobs, loving my friendships now, and totally losing weight daily. I also am pretty sure I am currently what some people call "in love!" I am not prepared to talk about this to anyone yet so this is just me throwing it out there but I haven't LOVED anyone for some time. All of you are aware of the adolfo drama and how that all played out but seriously, I am loving with all of my heart these days. I am not prepared to disclose what's going on in my heart or make a plan for how to deal with it yet but I sincerely am the happiest I have been in my heart to this point. I love when you find something great in your life and even if it never becomes yours, you are just happy to be there for the moment. I am truly blessed. The blog is going to be short today because I am exhausted and I need to go home and lay around and do nothing but I love you all and have a great day! ~Shalom~

      Hi everyone, the day is coming to a close and it's been a good restful one. I gave my 8 hours to the library today and I am exceedingly happy because Pam is back from Vacation. Pam, in case you aren't aware, is my absolute favorite part of O. Cope Budge Library! She is my mom away from mom and I appreciate her so much. Today I was able to have lunch with her and I am going to miss her so much when I leave Vanguard.  I have only 3 days until my trip to go and see Josh. I miss hanging out with him so I am very excited to get to have some fun with him for a few days. There are times where I think how lucky I am to know the best men on the universe. Between Josh, Joel, Jarrid, David, and all of my other favorite boys....my life is complete. I love them all differently (some of you know exactly what I mean) but seriously, they are the joy of my life. Thanks boys!!!!  Have you ever looked at someone you know and thought, "I seriously don't know anyone better!" I have had one of those moments today and seriously I am so blessed. I have been able to feel that about several people the last couple of days. I am so incredibly blessed in my life. I have these amazing girl friends (Heather, Heather*B*, Pam, and Hannah) and then these amazing men I have previously talked about. How good can one person have it??!!! I am such a lucky girl!  I am just feeling rather grateful today because my life is so full of people and things I love. Granted there are more people than things but I am materially blessed as well. I live in this gorgeous house for free, have great employers (3 of them), and drive the cavie which is barely even damaged. God is so good to me!  Well, I should get off here before you all puke from the gratitude of this post. Enjoy my friends and ~Shalom~

      Hello everyone. I didn't blog yesterday because it was such a busy day. I worked at BabyStyle from 2-7 but I closed so we ended up getting out at about 7:45 instead. It was so frustrating and literally every part of my body hurt. I was going to come in the library and blog but seriously, my body couldn't stand it.   My boss left yesterday for Grand Rapids, Michigan. He got there and they lost his luggage. I felt so bad for him because of all this trouble he has had with this trip. He is gone however and I have the house to myself. I am having a friend stay with me so that the monsters don't come out and get me. You gotta love when you have a friend who loves you and is willing to stay! I love my friends! :)   Work is going a little poorly because of the drama of losing our store manager. I have no idea what happened with that but I know it's drama and we are getting a lot of crap for it. It seems I either picked a great time to get hired there or a terrible one. I hear that we are really trying to improve the store and that had a lot to do with her needing to leave but either way, it's hard when it's your first week. I am a little frustrated but I have agreed to stick it out a little longer to make sure this is where I want to be. I don't particulary need the job because I could work other places but seriously, I kinda like it and I don't want to leave until I know that things aren't going to improve. If they improve a bit, I don't mind staying.   I have been doing really well on my weight loss since starting this new job. I am on my feet and running around so seriously, I have lost 2 lbs this week! So excited about that and I got into a pair of jeans this morning that were a size smaller. How exciting is that?!   Well, I am going to close this post for yesterday. Later today, I will blog on what happens today! Obviously! ;) Have a great day everyone and love you all so much!  ~Shalom~

      Today has been a really hard day. I went to BabyStyle at noon to work and it was crazy. My store manager was fired and noone is talking so I have no idea why?! I only started on Monday and already like 3 people are leaving and things are changing that I just learned. I am very frustrated with the secrecy among the managment at BabyStyle because it seems that I can't find anything out about what happened even to find out what the future holds for our management department.   The day was hard on it's own too with the store full at all times, a very irritable store manager who came from a different store and apparently hates us, and a mistake on my part early in the day. Those of you who know me are aware that I hate making mistakes and even more so, I hate admitting I made a mistake. The mistake wasn't a big deal because I sold a $100 gift certificate to a lady. I had never sold one before so I asked a co-worker to show me the ropes. I should note here that I have not been properly trained but more thrown to the wolves. We started with 2 days of very good training and then we went way off of schedule and I am learning as I go. Well anyway, I was standing with the co-worker guiding me through the process of selling a gift certificate. (We do not use gift cards but the actual certificates that go into envelopes). Well, she failed to tell me to activate the certificate or how to do it....so the lady left with a gift certificate not activated. We luckily figured out the # and were able to do it without her there but you know, it was frustrating because it looked like I was incompetent when quite honestly, I just wasn't taught. Oh well, crap happens and the day is over!  I have never wanted a day to end so badly as I did today. I am tired, hungry, discouraged, and completely sore all over. My back hurts so bad and oh look, no boyfriend to massage my back! This bites~ I haven't had the greatest of days but I love you guys and ideally my goal is to conquer this job and be excellent at it just the same as I try to do at everything else. I am having to perform quite a few pep-talks on myself right now. Please keep praying for me and I love you guys so much! Call me soon if you haven't! ~Shalom, I hope soon~

      Happy Friday everyone! I am glad it's Friday and I got a day off to just work at the library and relax my body a little. Today on my lunch hour I ran over to Carsmetics and got my beautiful wrecked vehicle looked at for an estimate. It has about $630 damage from the wreck on Wednesday. That isn't nearly as bad as I thought it might be. My main concern is that I am driving without a passenger side headlight. This isn't a big deal since I haven't had to drive at night all week but that means my weekend is shot because I would have to drive at night. I might get in trouble with the police due to it being out. That kinda stinks!  I honestly just hate walking out to my car and seeing the damage so I'll be looking forward to getting it repaired. They said they could do it in a day and that the damages aren't that bad. Of course, it's not their car so it looks realistic to them. To me, it might as well be smashed up because that's how I see it. I am grateful for how little damage was done and I need to stop being so melodramatic but those of you who really know me, know what this car means to me. Maybe I have something to learn from this little incident...ya think?  I have been considering purchasing a new car recently and now that obviously is going to be put on hold. I can't sell a car with no passenger side headlight. I am looking into buying a new car within the next 6 months. I am thinking about getting an Acura RSX so that's the plan. They are so nice. If you have never seen one, go ahead and go to www.acura.com and look at it. They are gorgeous. That's one of the many cars I am considering but it's the one I am considering most heavily. It will require some work to get it all figured out but I am up for work.   Today I was offered another job but I am seriously going to have to put some prayer in because 4 jobs is pushing it. I mean, I can always use the extra income due to my wreck now and a lot of other financial drama but I have no idea when I am supposed to have fun or sleep for that matter. I am having a hard time finding time for meals currently. If you haven't already checked it out, I have another blog about my weight loss endeavors and I have been complaining on there about that. That blog can be found on my profile. It's just a place that I log what I have eaten and what exercise I have gotten for the day. I am also going to be doing a weekly weigh in on there so anyone who was curious as to HOW CHUBBY I REALLY AM....it's there. I am going to weigh in every Saturday. I need to be accountable so that's helping.   I am really motivated at this point to lose weight but this week has just been hard with starting a new job and getting in an accident. OH well, move on and start working some more. Last night was my last counseling session for a while. We terminated therapy which means things are better. Thanks for all your prayers guys as most of you know the things I have had to endure throughout life and more importantly this year. God has really changed me into someone I honestly respect. There was a time (approximately 10 months ago) where I wasn't nearly an individual but today, I am getting there and liking who I am becoming.  I guess my main concerns right now are for my car to get repaired, prayers for my trip to Colorado, financial concerns, and continued healing for my heart and emotions. Take care everyone and thinking about you and missing you! ~Shalom~

      Hello all, I am feeling so much better about my car accident today. It always makes you feel better once the insurance company knows and your back stops hurting so bad. I should note that I did not miss work after the accident but went and worked from 8-3 the next day at Babystyle and then again from 8-4 today. It's constant running back and forth and on your feet so seriously, hurts the back a little. I am feeling a lot better today though so thanks for your prayers. I haven't heard anything about how much money in damages I have yet and I haven't had an adjuster come and look at it yet. We just contacted the insurance today so the ball is rolling.  I am happy to report I have a day off of babystyle tomorrow and I work all day at the library that I miss so much. I love Babystyle and I am getting really good at it but the problem is I miss my library peeps and the back room. I don't know what's going to happen at the end of August when my time at the library is through. Good thing I am going to stay seeing my girls though because I would miss them :( Babystyle is a mile a minute and keeps me hopping. I love MOST of the people I work with. I only have one problem person and she is not mean, just incompetent. I know that sounds mean but she can't do anything on her own and it's frustrating. I have really picked up the job rather quickly and I am excited to say I have been decent at it.   Everything else is going really well. The night I got into my accident I got to spend some much needed quality time with my favorite pal. I love when I get time with that particular human! Good for the heart ;) I was kinda griping about not getting any time with my friends the other day on here and God blessed me so much with time with my favorite friend! We watched "Blue Collar Comedy Tour!" If you haven't seen this masterpiece, I recommend you going out and renting it. It's a redneck blast!   Life other than that is really great too. Still loving the new house. I haven't really started "watching" Chris yet because he was supposed to go out of state with his dad this week but he didn't so he is with his mom right now. He and his dad will leave Sunday and will get back on Thursday. I leave Thursday to go to Colorado so needless to say, we aren't getting a whole lot of time together right now. I am very excited about getting to know him though and being a part of his life.   Colorado is coming quick and I'm excited to see my good buddy Josh! I miss him a little...I have to admit. I will make sure and post pictures onto the web-site from Colorado as soon as I can. I am also going up really soon to visit one of my favorite girls..Heather. She lives in Northern California so I am going up there for a few days to hang out. I miss her so much as she was my roomie and I was used to seeing her daily. She's the best and I am glad we are getting to see each other. I have some much needed vacation this way. Looking forward to winter when I can head home for a week or two!! Well, I should close this post out for the day as I have blabbed long enough. Take care everyone and I'm praying for all of you ~Shalom~

      Seriously it's the saddest day of my existence. I got into an accident last night and currently cavie is really banged up. It has no passenger side headlight and has deep scratches, black paint, and a dent in it's passenger side. This girl was going straight in a turn only lane while I was turning onto the 73 freeway and seriously banged up my car! It's ugly! I have had a very hard day. My body is in pain and I am cringing just sitting in my cushy library chair. Please keep me in prayer and my post is short today because of this maddness. I really need prayer for sure. I need things to be taken care of!  I love you dearly but please pray! Sad is the key word!  ~Shalom~

      I am officially kicking butt at selling baby and maternity items. I really love my new job and can you believe this, I'm good at it?! Today was only my 2nd day and I did a baby registry, helped customers out, and rang people up. I feel like I am learning really fast and do a pretty nice job at this! I am really starting to like retail so who knows. Maybe I could advance here! My goal is always to conquer, not just show up!  Things are really good at home. I am still loving the house although I have no idea what's going on this week with the trip being cancelled. I don't know if Chris is going to be around or if he is going to stay with his mom. Either way, I really love Chris and enjoy living there. This morning I realized how nice it is to actually eat real food at a dining room table. I know that sounds strange but when you have been in a dorm for 2 years, it is comforting to be able to cook something, eat it at a table, and wash your dish in a dishwasher. Life is good and I am grateful for the small things!   It's a little difficult right now because I am missing a lot of people. I don't have a lot of time on my hands so a social life is somehwat non-existent. I chose this life for myself so I have noone to blame but me but I miss my friends and family. I don't get a lot of time to hang with my closest buddies nor do I have time this summer to go home. Let's hope that my jobs clear me for Christmas because I have to see my family during the Christmas holiday. I miss some Indiana friends too. I miss Jarrid, my favorite boy back home and Carrie, my best girl-friend back home! They both mean the world to me and I don't get to hang out but just email and phone them. As sad as it is, I don't have a lot of time with my California friends either which totally stinks and I am going through a little lonliness stuff. I am super busy so I hardly notice until it's this time of night and I have to reflect on what my day was like. I find that it is empty without the people I love!  Well, I should stop sobbing and get on with my day so thanks for stopping in and reading today's post. Keep in touch everyone and keep those prayers coming! ~Shalom~

      Ok, can this story be any more bizarre? I got home from work today after posting my newest blog and my boss was there. Now, the problem is that he was supposed to be taking off from LAX at about 10 this morning. I walked in the house and found that he was not a happy camper. I guess his personal assistant ordered the wrong plane tickets and had him going to Chicago instead of Michigan. Now that's a problem! Without it being thousands of dollars more to go immediately he had to postpone his trip until Sunday the 11th. I am kinda bummed because I was looking forward to having the house to myself but overall I'll get over it. I can't have my friend over now and that stinks but maybe my friend can come over next week and stay with me instead. I really hope so because it will be loads of fun.  I will only get the house to myself from Sunday to Thursday because he is coming back on Thursday and I am actually leaving for Colorado that same day. The days he is gone, I'll be there and vice versa. I was able to spend some time with Chris this evening and he is so great. He is not feeling well so maybe if you think about you could throw some prayers his way because he has a little cold. I am not the mommying type but I gave him some children's Tylenol cold medicine. He said it tasted like chalk and I'm sure that's good for our first couple of days together. I am reminding myself of a mommy already. He is really a sweet kid but he needs more attention than he receives. It's going to be hard on my heart to see him struggle with that and not be able to give him my all either because I have other jobs. I will give him my 100% when I am with him but that's hard when he doesn't really have the ideal parenting situation. Please just pray for Chris and be thinking about his sweet little heart.  Well, I thought I would update the fact that I lost my chance to do the Risky Business scene until next week so please think about me and grieve for my loss. Have a great night all and Shalom!

      Today was my first official day at BabyStyle in Fashion Island. It was so much fun. I know that sounds bizarre because normally a first day on the job can be hectic and scary but it was just so much fun. My manager that is training me is the nicest lady on the planet and she just totally taught me so much. I was actually able to be on the floor today and I was able to help customers and enjoy the actual sales floor. I love the interaction and the fast paced way to be. I never thought I would like that but I totally do! I honestly just loved the first day. I know this is speaking rather positively and I might hate it when I get more into it but I have a good attitude about it. It's fun being around little ones all day and happy pregnant mommies looking to spend a lot of bones! :)  Our stuff is really cool and it totally serves a lot of different kinds of people. There are rather expensive items but there are also some more affordable items for those of us who do not roll in the dough but rather merely wade in it a bit. Check out the web-site if you have kids at www.babystyle.com. It's good stuff. I get a nice little discount as well so I guess all the babies and pregnant mommies in my life are going to get some nice gifts. Come on people, get pregnant so I can buy you things! HA HA :) Just kidding, I wouldn't wish that on anyone!  The weird part of this is that most of the people I work with do NOT have kids and are not married. That's such a nice transition from what I thought I would have and the marriage happy Vanguard. Now don't get me wrong, I love Vanguard but can we seriously go one day without mentioning being engaged. Thanks! ;) I am a little bitter but I'll get through it. Anyway, overall the first day was a blast and everything was great.   I am still loving my beautiful new place to live and I have the house to myself (and a friend) for the next week. I am going to just have a blast all by myself pretending to be a wealthy girl. Noone has to know that I plan to do the "Risky Business" scene with Tom Cruise right in front of the baby grand piano. It has to happen. You would do it too...don't laugh.   Well all, have a beautiful day and thank you so much for your prayers. They are certainly working as I feel happy to have been hired here. Well this is me signing off! ~Shalom~

      Can I just tell you how I LOVE the house! I have been living there only 3 days and I am in love with it. I have decorated my entire room and bathroom and really enjoyed every minute of living there. Richard (my boss) is seriously the nicest guy on the planet. He is so gentle and caring and that's really nice. He is actually going away for the whole next week and I get the house to myself. That's a really nice perk for the first week of living there. I plan to make the most of it if I can and have a friend over. :) Who knows, fun times ;)  Everything in life is going really well and I am just trying to move in all of my stuff at this point. I am getting settled there and then I start my new job on Monday. I am a little nervous about starting at BabyStyle but I think I will like it. I am really just nervous about the details like learning the cash register and learning how to deal with customers appropriately. Retail is actually something I have always wanted to do and now I get that opportunity and I want to take it while I can! I am looking forward to all the people interaction and also the nice hours that they are giving me.   I had a day with the little girl I am mentoring today. We went to Boomers and played in the arcade, drove go-carts, and did virtual reality. It was so fun! We always have such a good time together. She is a really great girl. I am looking forward to having more great outings with her.   Well I am going to close this post for the day but have a great 4th everyone and keep in touch. Please keep praying about my new job and all the things that are new! I love you all and am missing those of you who I haven't seen in a while! ~Shalom~

      Hello again everyone! Today has been a lot slower since I have spent my day working in the library. I am very excited to go home tonight just because I am actually going to a home! I haven't had a home in 2 years. I mean, I was able to spend Christmas and Summer vacations last year with Adolfo's family, whom I love dearly, but it's not the same as having your own space and your own place! All of you who have lived in a dorm or been away from home for an extended amount of time understand my plight. I went today on my lunch break to Target and invested in an office chair for my desk and a bookcase. These are big steps for me in the home making process. I was really excited because I haven't had the ability to buy anything for my space being that it was a dorm and it would pretty much be a waste. That being said, Target officially owns me financially. Does anyone know what I am talking about? Do you walk in Target and feel like you might be a "preferred customer" because I do. I wonder things in my head sometimes like "I bet they are sick of me here and I think I wore this outfit last time!" I am so serious. Target is my drug of choice. I am utterly shocked when I leave the grounds of the hallowed bulls eye with less than a $50.00 receipt in my pocket. These are the things I think about. There are reasons that I have 3 jobs! (laugh)  Things in my life are going beautifully but seriously on the stress uprise. I am trying to take my time and think every day through instead of rushing through weeks in my head and thinking about the upcoming problems that COULD occur. I have this serious flaw in my character of "overthinking" (for lack of a better word) things. I take a situation and I literally kill it, looking at the realm of possiblities that COULD happen. I know it would be wiser to just pray about it, let it happen, and live the moment but NO, I have to literally sort it out into what could happen and the strategies I have ready at that point. What is wrong with me? I am a psych major and more screwed up than any of you! There is something or many things that draw me to the major of psych.   The newest news of my life is that I am going to Colorado in just 13 days. I am going out to see Josh! (friend from Vanguard--see web-page) Josh is from Colorado and lives there during the summer to work and see family and stuff. He is dating my last year roomie and one of my best girl-friends, Heather. She is actually in Colorado now enjoying his company. I am going out there on July 15th and I am so excited I can hardly wait. I have never been to Colorado and I hear it's just beautiful. Also, if you know me at all, you know I am practically obsessed with the story of Columbine. I study it trying to understand the killers psychologically and it has captivated me since it happened. I am actually getting to go there and see Columbine for myself. Yes, I know it's a little morbid but seriously a place I have been wanting to go. I am also looking forward to going to the mountains and getting to spend time with Josh. Josh is one of my best guy friends in the world. He is so fun! I am not getting to go home this summer to Indiana which sucks because I miss my pals and family but I will be heading home for the Christmas Holidays because "home is where the heart is"! Did I seriously just say that? I am really excited to head home at Christmas though because I haven't seen some of my friends for a long time. Looking forward to that!  I should be closing this post for the day but have a great weekend and Happy 4th of July if I don't get to post before then. I am praying for all of you and appreciating your prayers! Take care and Shalom!

      Hi all! I am posting for yesterday because it was pure crazy with all I had to do. You will all be happy to hear that I have officially moved in to my new place. I love that house so much and the room is slowly becoming mine. It's absolutely adorable! I decorated myself and if I can be so bold, it's beautiful! I still don't have everything put away but being the organized person that I am, I have to take my time on such matters.  I was able to spend some of the day with Chris and getting to know him a little. I had no idea that there was a specific age where you did that thing where you repeated everything someone says. Apparently it's about 11 years old. He does that! It is probably going to be the death of me but it sounds like a fun challenge. He does this with a very whiney voice too ...in order to imply that is how I talk I think. Who knows? I think this Blog will be so funny because of how I think about children. A lot of you already know this but seriously, NOT SO GOOD WITH KIDS! I have a knack for loving certain children and really loving them. I love Hailey & Riley (Carrie's kids) more than I have ever loved a child but that's different. I also love little Gavin (Joel's Cousin)but quite honestly he is the cutest little boy I have EVER seen. That being said, I am now going into working as a Nanny and working at a Baby clothing store. You are probably asking yourself why I would put myself through this but my answer will be simple. I need to be stretched. I need to do things that challenge my normal schemas. You know, I was recently told that I challenge some schemas and I found that to be a compliment. Maybe mine will be challenged in the course of my new life as a nanny and BabyStyle sales associate. Who knows?!   Well, this is my post from yesterday and stay tuned for today's post. My life is so exciting that you seriously will never be bored. Have a great day all and may this day bring you all you absolutely need!

      Hi everyone. How is everyone doing this fine Tuesday. I am hoping this finds you all doing well and healthy. My day was absolutely the busiest I have seen in weeks. Today we went to kidnap the R.A.'s for breakfast for floor moms/sisters. We had a great time and our R.A. is super nice and very organized. I like her a lot. It looks like it's going to be a fun first year in Floor Moms for me. We have a lot of fun stuff planned and I am looking forward to it. Later in the day I worked and had lunch at Heather's house with the library girls. We had a great time chowing down on salad and pizza and of course chatting about things that aren't appropriate. It was a great time.  Overall I worked all day and took a mid day nap and that's about all that happened. Oh well, I guess it was a boring day for me but either way, a good one!  Love you all and ~Shalom~

      Hey everyone. It's Monday again so that means a clean, fresh start for a week. I know that is looking at it pretty positively but when you have had a long day like mine..you have to do something. I got up this morning and headed to work for some of the day. I had to get home for lunch at 2:00 and then back to work until 4:30. We (me, Pam, Heather, and Judy) all went over and decorated our table for the kidnap the RA breakfast tomorrow morning for floor moms. We did a really good job and our table is quite festive. Our floor's theme is "Dream Team" so it is all patriotic and sporty. Pretty cute if you ask me.  After work I had to go and pick Chris up from the Boys and Girls Club. He was especially ADD today and almost made me insane. I was making dinner and he was playing Mario party and literally reciting every sound the game made and yelling "OH BABY" at the screen when he would win a mini-game. Parenting is looking like less and less of an option these days. ha ha I made some grilled steak, corn on the cob, and peaches for dinner so it became apparent when Chris sat down at the table that he has braces. I forgot when making corn on the cob so he really couldn't eat that. Oh well, he didn't complain. After that his dad got home and took him to see Bourne Supremecy. It looks good and I am sure they will have fun. They need father/son time anyway!  My day is going to have to end early tonight as I have to be up at literally 6:00 am for that breakfast. I am not so stoked about that. I am not quite that much of a morning person. I am really good around 7-8. My goals for the rest of the evening are to bust out some book jackets, talk to a friend or two, work out, and get to bed relatively early. Tomorrow's goals are to find some jobs to apply to, work out my financial situation for the month, send some mail out, work out, and spend some time with the Lord. I have been neglecting my walk lately. I really need to get it together. I really need to learn priorities and fast.  Things are going alright but I am learning that I focus too much on the future instead of keeping my goals in mind. I need prayer to remember the comittments I have made and stick to them. I am really hoping for some drive lately. Please keep praying for a new job as it's my last week at Vanguard. Thanks everyone and ~shalom~

      Hello everyone and I hope your sunday is going well. Mine was excellent. I started out my day with a phone call from a friend so that always makes me happy. I then went into work for a little bit and then took Jaylie bowling in the afternoon. This is a good place to ask you all to pray for little Jaylie. She is the little girl that I mentor and she is going through some hard times. I won't be specific on here but she is attending Royal Family Kids Camp this coming week. This camp, in case you aren't aware, is a camp for abused and neglected children. She will be attending and will have a counselor all to herself. This is very important for her as she is really in need of some help right now. Please be praying for Jaylie if you are someone of prayer.  Bowling was a ton of fun and I bowled two great games at 154 and 142. I am not usually that wonderful of a bowler but I was on fire. After bowling I went home and grabbed some lunch and then back to work for an hour or so.  I then got a phone call so I talked for a while and then I decided to treat myself to a night out at Old Spaghetti Factory. I love the Spaghetti factory so I was very excited about that. I have to put some words in for OSF right now because they messed up my dinner and I was already at home so I decided not to drive back over there. I ended up calling them and just explaining the situation and they are sending me gift certificates for dinner for two. You have to appreciate a business that corrects their mistakes gracefully. They will forever have my business!!  In other news, I worked until late last night and then got a call from my favorite boy. I love talking to him so that is always a treat. I overall had a great day and am starting this week with new focus. I am trying to realize that my goals right now are serious and important. I need to remember the three goals; weight loss, financial independence, and grad school. Those are the focus of the week and I will write about how those things are going throughout the week. I called on the two jobs I have applied for today and still hearing nothing as they are taking their time. Please pray that God comes through with something soon. I am concerned.  I have Chris some of the week this week so please pray that I will reach him in some way and I can learn him better. I am really pretty nervous about cooking dinner for the two of them a lot. I am not a bad cook but I am still a female who worries about pleasing her audience. Oh well, I am just belly aching at this point.  I wanted to take this time to say a few things to some people. Happy Anniversary to Carrie and Paul last Thursday. I forgot to blog about it but they have been married 4 years! Carrie is my friend from Indiana (from High School) and she is a phenomenal woman with great kids and a wonderful husband. God has blessed her so much and is going to continue to ..I am sure of it. Also, a congrats to Heather Barrington as she now officially has a companion. I don't like to be stupid and say "YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND" but Jason and Heather are officially a couple. I am so happy for her and very excited to meet Jason. I had to blog about it because some day..this blog will be famous. ha ha  Have a great day all and thanks for stopping in ~Shalom~

      Hi everyone. Thanks for stopping in to my blog. It's a gorgeous Saturday in Southern California. Today was a big day for me as Cavie got her eye fixed. As stated earlier in the blog, I was in a car accident and a mean vicious girl hit Cavie and caused the headlight and blinker to come out. The blinker was destroyed but the headlight wasn't. Either way there was a big gaping hole where the headlight panel use to be. Today I went to the wonderful people at Carsmetics in Costa Mesa, California and had them repair the light. It looks so much better and it didn't do a whole lot of damage to my wallet either. I am so happy to have Cavie back as a whole and now all I need to do is get some rubbing compound and work out some of the black paint on my car and get those tiny dents taken out. It's not a huge deal so I am just happy because it could have been so much worse.  Later in the afternoon I got to hang out with my best guy friend in the world, which we all know is JOEL! We had a good time just going to Home Depot and having lunch together. In case you wondering why Home Depot, there are two things in my house that need repaired in my downstairs abode and Joel is fixing them for me. I have a closet door that the track is broken and I need a new medicine cabinet. Either way, those are the things that need done and Joel is such a good friend to want to help me. We went to price supplies at Home Depot and I totally loved it. That is a great store ladies. If you have never been in there, it really isn't that bad. I have found that I really like hardware stores now and auto parts stores. I really like the idea of fixing things myself and/or watching Joel fix them (wink wink) Either way, It was a fun time at the Home Depot. We went and had some subway for lunch and I had this salad that was really good but it took me an hour after eating it to realize that they forgot my chicken! I was pretty astounded that I paid $5.29 for some greens. Oh well, move on Erica!  It was amazing because this morning I got on the scale and I was 4 lbs lighter. I don't know if that is particularly healthy or not but I am so stoked about being 224 lbs now and not 336 so I am ok with it. I am hoping for a 2 lb weight loss each week so that was huge for me. I covered 2 weeks in one. I know that won't happen very often so I am kinda marinating in it today. Overall, doing really well with the weight loss and dreaming of being in a bikini when I am done. Don't worry all, you'll see because I will wear it to the grocery store, in the snow, etc... Just kidding  My night was pretty uneventful except for I met a new interesting person. I am meeting some really great people lately and God is defintely opening doors for me to understand my strengths. I am just being patient for his perfect timing and perfect people to come into my life. By perfect, I don't mean flawless...I mean right for me. Anyway, a big thanks to Joel for a great day with him and a big thanks to everyone who is praying. Still looking for a second job so keep the prayers going. Have a beautiful day all and ~Shalom~

      This friday has been packed with things to get done. This morning I had to take Chris to the Boys and Girls Club but his mom has him for the weekend so I guess I have some time to myself. I then had to go to the bank, take a shower, do laundry, and get to school for a floor moms event. We built these survival kits today that are for the new students so that they will feel welcome on "welcome week" imagine that. We had some fiasco with not enough erasers and bandaids and it was funny.  After that I chilled with Heather in her office most of the afternoon looking at her new laptop and hearing all about her life. I love that girl, we keep each other going for sure. After work I headed to Sears portrait studio to get my photos I took a while back. They were really good and I am excited about them. There is a page on my web-site with the pictures so make sure and stop by and see them. They are under the heading "Erica's Sears Photo Shoot."  After Sears, I went over to Borders to do some damage with a giftcard I got from Markita for my birthday. I ended up buying a new workout dvd that is a hip hop dance aerobic workout. That should be fun for me and get me dancing again. I also bought a planner (how mature of me) and I got a friend from Texas a Newport Beach postcard. He'll like it I am sure as it makes Newport Beach look like paradise. Oh well, isn't it?  After Borders I went by Target to spend my other giftcard from Heather. I had used about 1/2 of it developing some pictures the other day but I had enough to buy a new cd so I got the Twista cd. If you don't like rap you probably don't know who that is. I really love the cd and it's fun dancing music. I like something like that to drive to.  After all of that shopping maddness I came and worked for a while, worked on the web-page, and now I am blogging and going home. I haven't heard from the new interesting boy today but I am sure all is well. I am really excited about the rest of my weekend. I am hanging out with Joel tomorrow afternoon, Jaylie on Sunday I think, and getting Cavie fixed. Please pray for me for finances as it's going to be a tough month.  I would advise everyone to stop in to the web-site as I added literally 7 pages of new stuff. I also updated celebrity of the week, song of the week, movie of the week, and musician of the week. They are all fun places to check out so please stop in and make use of all of my work. I guess that's all I have to say for the day so everyone have a great day tomorrow and take care of yourself. If we haven't talked ...give me call. ~Shalom~

      How is everyone in my blog land doing today? I am doing well but this day has been absolutely busy busy busy! I have Chris at the house right now so it's been scheduling conflicts all over the place. Today was grocery shopping day so it has been crazy for sure. I have decided that having kids is really one of the hardest jobs in the entire world. Being a therapist is going to be easy compared to this. I find myself thinking about him in the day and hoping he is making wise choices, eating well, and he's not sad. I worry about him constantly. I love the boy! I really do.  Some of you know me well enough to know I have really struggled with the idea of having children. I have always feared that I lacked a sense of maternal instinct. I have always felt that I didn't really have much of a "motherly" attitude and really found children unnecessary in my life. I have always liked them on the surface whether it be in babysitting or school or whatever but never thought I, myself, would really like the job. Well, I am here to tell you that in ways that little boy is changing my mind ...in others...not so much.  I am very frustrated with the schedule right now of having to have him everywhere at one time and making sure everything is done or else. I really need to get together and learn him and his schedule for this to be better. The main thing I am noticing though is that it is completely rewarding and terrifying all at the same time. I mean, he is gorgeous and sweet and he is lovable. I love when he thanks me for something or I notice he is genuinely touched by my love for him. I am really hoping I help him to become the man that God wishes him to be. I really hope that when he looks back on his life, he remembers how much his nanny Erica loved him and that somehow he knows how much I pray for him. I am in love with him. I literally feel close to him already and it's only been about a month and 1/2. It's crazy how fast kids glue to you.  Overall, that was my main thought process today and I decided to share it with you. Now, I know that some of you are mommies and daddies and you know all about this already. I know that some of you are like "DUH ERICA" and think I am stupid for not wanting kids. Others of you are a lot like me. You wonder if you could handle it or if you are cut out for it. I am not telling anyone to go out and have kids if they don't want them but I officially know that if God were to give me children by the process that we all know causes them....I wouldn't be so sad. He is precious and has changed my heart about children.  My day today has been crazy but overall, well. I got an estimate on the cavie to have her headlight fixed today and it is a little steep to get done but she has an appointment on Saturday so I will officially not be illegal on Saturday evening. I am really happy about that as it's crazy not having a headlight. Please be praying that I will get some $$ in order to get the rest of the damages repaired on Cavie. I am sad that she is so bruised up. (Yes, she is a person to me!...don't laugh)  In other news, I am still carrying around my new turtle (his name is Joel). He is absolutely adorable and most of the time lives in my purse but likes to watch me type on my keyboard during the work day. He is great and by far my favorite new turtle. I told BIG Joel that I would carry him around and I don't think he believed me ...but we'll see JOEL! :)  I am still interested in someone new which is exciting to me. I know it sounds funny to update this daily but I lose interest fast. I am not saying I am attention deficit or anything like that but more like I am SO PICKY! I just have all of these standards about what a person is like in a relationship so I am very observant. I will tell you all that this man I met is one of the most interesting people I have met in a long time. He is intelligent, passionate, sweet, FUNNY, and completely down to Earth. I don't know where anything is going for sure because I am a woman of MUCH time but seriously, what a fun time getting to know an interesting man again. (Wait,  when did it happen the first time?) ha ha Just kidding, I know a lot of interesting men but they are my guy-friends.  In my two biggest goals of life I have to tell you I have been getting off track. My first goal is to lose this 103 lbs and be healthy. Well, this week I have eaten ok and not exercise at all. I am really mad at myself and totally need to bust out some moves tonight. I have just been so tired and drained and ok...lazy and I haven't done it. My other big goal is to get financially independent and let's be honest, I work all the time so I guess I am doing that. I am really trying and being very frugal with money and that's something I need to learn.  Last night I went out to dinner with Josh for my birthday. He took me to Carl's Jr. because it's somewhere we both like to eat. We had a really great time just chatting and we always learn something from each other. He is a great asset to my life and I appreciate his love and friendship so much.  Big prayer request right now is that I need a second job starting early Sept. I am so nervous that I won't find one so can we please agree to pray together. I need a job bad!!!! I am really hoping for Newport Beach library to call me or this other job that was available for an office position. I am really concerned though and could use some prayer!  Ok, I think I have blabbed enough today but this is a catch everyone up day. This is what's going on with me and I could use some peace and quiet for a few days. This weekend I am planning on getting Cavie fixed, resting by reading some of Atlas Shrugged, and taking Jaylie bowling. Looking forward to bowling since I LOVE IT! OK, well I am out but as always ~Shalom~

      Happy Wednesday everyone. I am happy to say I have had a great day today. I met someone new yesterday that really interested me and I am just happy that there are interesting people left in the world. I have no idea what that means to me but either way, it's good to know they are out there. I am pleasantly surprised! I guess today would be a good day for me to talk about LOVE. I know that's a huge word and a lot of you reading it will wonder why in the heck I have chosen today to talk about it. Well, here is why:  I really believe that love is an aquired taste. I have been through a lot in my short life to know that love is real and it's mostly very fragile. There are so many different definitions for the word LOVE. There are so many ways to use the word love too. You can say you love french fries or you can say you love your husband/wife. Either way, same word. I think that's strange. I also think it's strange to say you have fallen in love. I mean, did you honestly FALL in love. NO, you chose to love someone else. On top of that, can we please take our time and get to really KNOW someone before we decide we love them. It's absolutely imperative that we know them in a way that makes certain that we can appreciate the things about the person that they themselves love about them. I have decided that when I decide to love again, it's going to be so great. I will love my man with everything I am and give all I can and I will not regret one single moment, BUT, I will also stop using that word to describe it. Yes, one day I will again say I love you to a man but when I say it, I'll know I mean it.  I will be so ready to say it because I will be waiting until appropriate and mostly, until I know that feeling is legit and not based upon limerance (word I learned in Shirley's classes) It means the "honeymoon period" of 2 years. I also will take things for what they are. I will love the little things like single roses, walks, compliments, photo opportunities, picnics, and all those other things I took for granted before "the ring" came. I will stop looking at a man and thinking to myself "I wonder what kind of husband he'll make?" and start saying "I wonder what kind of man he is?"  I need to start re-evaluating the things I take to have value in life. I really do want to someday find that MAN that completes me. I think he'll be so wonderful. He'll be cute (to me), drive a car he loves, know how to fix that car he loves, be musical either in instruments or voice or just a genuine love for music, sensitive and sweet, more than willing to be attentive and romantic, passionate about things he loves and me, completely satisfied with who I am and love that I am so driven and improving on myself, honest with me and push me to greatness, and mostly, he will just captivate my heart by his love (not love for me but in general.)  Overall, these are the things that are going through my head today. You might be asking yourself, "Why today Erica?" and I would answer simply "Just because!" I have really had some thinking to do and I love being challenged to do that thinking and just reflect on things I want. Hallelujah for a clear mind. Well have a great day all and I hope you learned something. ~Shalom~

      Good day everyone. Have you ever had a feeling like you might be getting sick or something but you don't feel sick yet? I am having that kind of day. I feel really groggy but not sure what's going on. I waited a really long time last night to eat because it was my birthday and there was birthday stuff going on but seriously, not feeling quite right.  My birthday ended up being glorious. I got home from work and my BEST FRIEND in the entire world came over sporting flowers, a turtle (I am in love), a sweet card, a cd, and a little added bonus suprise after all was said and done. I had an amazing time. Joel was the sweetest kid ever to me yesterday and one day of sweet Joel is worth a whole year of waiting. The turtle he got me is the cutest little guy in the world. He has big green eyes like me. His name is Joel because he has a big head and well....guess that is self-explanatory. ha ha  After Joel left, Heather and Josh came over and I love my sweeties and they spent time with me. Heather took me for some late night tacos and we can't complain with that. It was such a great time and overall the birthday got so much better. I appreciate all of you who wished me a happy birthday and made my day a little brighter. I appreciated all the cards, e-cards, gifts, and mostly your time and thoughts. I find that time = love with me!  Guys, I want to take a moment and just wish two people a happy anniversary today. Today Josh and Heather have enjoyed each other's companionship for a whole year! Please let them know you are thinking about them today if you know either of them! They would be glad to hear from you. They are having a good day so far and Josh is pretty busy but they are going to have a great night I am sure.  Again to everyone reading this, thank you for 24 great years (or however long you have been around). I truly saw your love yesterday and it is exceptional. Have a great evening all and as always ~Shalom~

      Hello everyone. A big giant Happy Birthday to me today! I have had an ok day so far but it's only 4:00 and I can't say I am not completely disappointed in some of the things that have went down. I had a good morning. My girls at the library took me to lunch and they all were wonderful. I had such a great time eating with them and of course they all were so thoughtful.  My friend Heather brought this giant dragon fly balloon and beautiful flowers over which was so sweet. I was also woke up this morning by a singing Jarrid and that was amazing. I love that kid! Overall things have been decent. I am glad to say my day is over at 5:00 here though and I don't have any birthday plans for the evening so um, yeah! OK, so I have to close this or I might start crying!  ~Shalom~

      Hi everyone. I have to be honest with you all, I am completely and utterly bummed on this 24th year. I officially have NO birthday plans tomorrow. I take that back, I do have plans in the day to go to lunch with my library crew. That is a very exciting thing for me because I love my girls (Pam, Heather, and Markita)! This year I am feeling less than prepared for the way my life has turned out. I know that I made a lot of these life changing decisions but ideally, I have no idea where I am going to be next. I have made so many huge choices this last year that I am thrown to the wind, so to speak.  I should note that overall I am very happy with my life. I am happy that I am single again and healthy emotionally. I am happy that I am on my way to my weight goal. I am happy that I just graduated college and am one smart cookie. I am happy that I have a life full of friends who are absolutely amazing people. I am happy that I have role models that are strong intelligent men. I am happy that I have three beautiful women who are priceless to me as friends. I am happy because I am finally developing a positive relationship with my father. I am happy that I have created boundaries this year that have been problems all of my life. I am happy that I have told people things about me this year that have plagued me for many years. I am happy that I am free of the terrible, abusive people that once hurt me daily. I am happy that I have eliminated "friends" who find it necessary to critique everything about me and then say how they love me as a friend. I am happy that I am working for an amazing man with a great kid who I am going to get to influence for the better. I am happy that I have a beautiful house to live in and a warm bed to sleep in. I am happy that I have my sanity through one of the worst years of my life. I am happy that I am not divorced or married at this time. I am happy that I have people I can talk to when my days are hard. I am mostly happy that I now know the kind of person I want to spend my life with.  I know that I said I was bummed but that's why I chose to use this blog today to count my blessings. Upon looking over the last 24 years, I can't help but realize how much God has made of me. I am proud of the woman I am. I am an amazing woman who is strong, honest, dedicated, hard working, loving, passionate, driven, focused, funny, and adorable! I like me and I am glad that 24 years later, I am still kicking!  I just want to take this time to end today's blog with a prayer! I love my God and I am so happy he's in my life this year!  Heavenly Father,  Thank you so much for 24 years on this Earth. You have blessed me with so much. I have the greatest friends, family, and environment. You have done immeasurably more than I could ever have imagined. Thank you for my mind to think with. Thank you for the people in my life. Thank you for my good qualities and the bad ones to keep me grounded. Thank you for my health both physical and emotional. Thank you for 6 years with a man I loved and thank you for the years later with a man I will adore! Thank you for freeing me from all that is bad for me. Most of all thank you so much for the people that I love so much. ~Amen~  Guys, let's be serious, if you are reading this I just love you and thanks for sticking with me! You are all so wonderful! This blog is dedicated to you....all of you: Joel, Jarrid, Carrie, Josh, Heather S., Pam, Heather B., Markita, Hannah, Britt, Mom, Dad, Boss, Fazz, Tasha, Dave, and the list goes on. Even you Adolfo! Take care of yourselves everybody and on this Birthday Eve...thanks for the memories! Peace out and ~Shalom~

      Hello everyone. I am happy to report your beautiful blog moderator is 2 lbs lighter today. I weighed in this morning and thank God, I lost 2 lbs more! I am very happy about this and it sure will add some happiness to my birthday on Monday! Things here are going well and I still don't have birthday plans with anyone! I am nervous that I am going to be chillin at home with myself for my birthday. I sure hope not friends! :)  Today I met an interesting boy. Have you ever met someone and thought "could they honestly have this much in common with me?" There is this guy. We'll call him Mike because that is his name.  ha ha. He is a psych major @ Northridge, drives a new Honda Civic (fast), thinks that "big" girls can be sexy, (Hallelujah) and has pierced nipples. I know that last part threw some of you off but oh well. Let's be honest, I am interested!  Oh well, I'll keep you all posted on the happenings for my birthday and on from there. Overall things are about the same. Working on getting things caught up and losing weight. I guess that's about it. My birthday is on Monday so that's exciting. I also get to spend Tuesday and Wednesday with Chris so I am looking forward to that. Anyway, I'll write tomorrow as I don't have much to say. Have a great day everyone and ~Shalom~

      Today is Friday people and I am happy about that. Today is my last weekday before my birthday. I don't know if everyone knows this but I am WAY into my birthday. I always love my birthday. I love that one day is dedicated to attention on  ME!  I have no idea what is going down for my birthday because I'll find out in accordance to who loves me...but either way I am determined to have a good day and be happy that I am alive and better this year.  Today has been pretty good. I met with Jaylie's therapist today and found out some disturbing things that have been happening in her life so please keep Jaylie in your prayers. I took my pictures this morning to get developed so they will be ready on Sunday but I have to wait until I have money to pick them up which may not be until Monday or Tuesday. I can't wait to get them back as they will be soooo hot with Joel in most of them  :)     I really need prayers for a new job. I am done at the library in just 18 or so days and I am nervous about finding a second job to supplement the nanny income. I am really worried about not making enough to live. I have no idea what is going to happen but just be assured I need your prayers! Everything is going well at the library and on Monday my girls are taking me out to lunch. You gotta love them!  Today has been a total relaxed day. We haven't had a whole lot going on or getting done here in good old O. Cope Budge Library. Productivity was at an all time low on my side of the cubicle today. Oh well, it's friday!  Guys, I really miss home right now. I miss my family, Jarrid, Carrie, Hailey & Riley, and of course persimmon puddin'! I am really longing for a week at home. That's all it ever takes for me to get over Indiana. I mean I love it because it's home but I don't want to live there again. Let's all just pray that jobs and money work out so I can spend some time there at Christmas because I don't know how Christmas without my family will feel. I don't want to know. I tried to do that in 2002 and it just didn't work for me.  Well everyone, I love you all dearly and hope that this Friday found you all happy and healthy. Please email me soon if we haven't talked or give me a call on my cell! I love you all dearly and ~Shalom~

      Have you ever had a day where you thought through some things and just got REALLY sad? I am having one of those days. I am really trying to focus on the new, good things in my life but instead I keep thinking about things I have lost. I keep thinking about lost friendships, not being in college anymore, lost people just by moving on, and of course missing my family. I am also thinking about financial matters, my birthday ALONE, and the loss of dreams. I really need a pick me up today and I am not sure what it is going to take.  I am really kinda nervous about the job predicament so that might be the major reasoning for this mood I am in. I am very nervous that I won't find a job in the next two weeks and I will not be ok. I have just recently broken free from having anyone help me and to be completely honest, it feels wonderful. The only problem is, it is very nerve racking when you think you might not be able to handle that. I am just really having a difficult time finding my way right now.  I had a very interesting conversation with my boss last night and it ended up that things are a bit sticky in his life. I am sure that he is going to be ok but seriously, I am worried about his heart and well-being right now. I am not quite sure of everything about him but I certainly am learning more about him daily. Chris still isn't staying with us so I miss his cute little face. I am very excited to start being in his daily life and helping him become a little man. It will be a fun time for sure.  I am hoping my next day in life gets a little more positive as this is kinda sad. Thanks for stopping in and ~Shalom~

      Good evening everyone! I am happy to report I am back home for a while until Thanksgiving. I am going up to Northern California again @ Thanksgiving to spend the holiday with Heather and her family. I am very excited about getting to do that as I love Heather and her family. I am so grateful to them for having me up the last couple of days. I just came home this afternoon after a great morning ride in the car with Joel. We (meaning me) had such a great time just making memories on the way back. I don't want to speak for him and say he had a great time because he might have been going crazy with me in the car. Let's be honest, I took about 14 pictures of him driving on the way back. I am quite the photo-crazed loon and he is rather photo-genic so the two go hand in hand. I am always pretty inappropriate too so I am sure he felt harassed and treated as an object. Oh well, he liked it ;)  So anyway, I had such a great time in Northern California. I saw a lot of great sites and met a lot of great people. Not to mention the amazing 10-12 hours in the car with Joel there and back. It was a great time! Be sure and stop into the web page to see the photos probably around next week because they will be all developed and loaded up.  Have you guys ever had a time in your life where you just wanted something so bad that it captiavated your every thought? I mean, I want something so badly that I think about it all the time. Now, I know you are all probably thinking it's a boy...but it's not. I have been really desiring to lose the last of this weight. I wish I could say that the "last" of the weight is a measley 10-15 lbs but it's more like 105 lbs. I am worn out from thinking about it and I am tired of seeing the extra weight in the mirror. I know that I have come a long way by losing 106 lbs now but when you have so much to lose, it's just not enough.  I am hoping that all of you reading this will say a prayer for my heart as it's very frustrated in dealing with this weight fight constantly. There are other "things" that I desire after and this weight is getting in the way of me getting those things in life. I want so badly to just take it off like a suit. I just want to wake up in the morning and not see it. I am getting kinda weepy so maybe I should shut up and get over it. Please keep me in prayer if you are reading this. I am doing really well on my eating habits, exercise, and losing the pounds but agian, just not fast enough. Please pray I stay realistic and don't lose sight of the goal. Thanks for stopping by everyone and ~Shalom~

      Today I met Heather's Brothers Brian and Kevin. They were both really great and completely different. I first of all had lunch with Heather's family and that was fun. Heather's brother Brian is married and has a little boy, John.  He is the cutest thing ever. I had so much fun playing with him and eating lunch with him. Heather and I left for Sacramento (around that area) at about 2:00 to see her oldest brother Kevin. Kevin was totally cool and a blast to hang out with. We ended up going to a car show where I saw some pretty nice wheels (pictures on web-site to come) and went to TGIFridays and had dinner. It was a blast and we got along very well.  The day was great but completely exhausted is the word I can come up with. Leave for home early in the morning so must close this post. Look out for tomorrow's post to find out how the road trip home went! Have a great day and ~Shalom~

      Hello everyone. Today I am coming to you from good old Livermore, California. I am here seeing Heather. I love my girl and I missed her so much. I got in at about 5 a.m. and it was a great ride up here. I got to come up with my best friend in the entire world...Mr. Joel Forbes. He and I had a great time and made some memories. For all of you who are confused on what that means, I took some pictures. I intend to take some on our way back too. He is adorable and we had such a great time laughing, talking, singing, and oh, listening to so much Garth Brooks ...all of the cds ever made I think.  I will be loading all of my Northern California pictures on the web-site when I have some money to have them developed. Let's be honest, I have $22 to last me until my next paycheck. A little concerned but I have learned it's kinda fun to see how far you can get. All my bills are paid right now and that's good. I am still waiting to hear on a new job to supplement the nanny income when my library position ends so please pray for some leads to come through.  So far Nor. Cal has been loads of fun. I got in and went straight to bed clutching my phone and hoping that Joel got to Redding ok. I was worried about him since he still had about 2 and 1/2 hours after dropping me off. What an amazing man ...that Joel. I found out he was fine but by that time, it was time to get up for the day and do some stuff I had to do. Heather's friend Mike came over to go out to lunch with us. That was a blast because I really like Mike. He is a supremely nice guy! I really enjoy him. We went and had togo's for lunch and then we went to see Heather's friend Sammy. She is also nice and I met her mom.  We left at about 2:00 for San Francisco (Heather, Heather's Mom, Sammy, and myself). I was so super excited about this since I have never been there. It was really great as I got to see some awesome sights. I took some pictures so stayed tuned to the web-site to see what I saw. We ate at this seafood place right on the water and it was great and the whole day was wonderful.  We came back to Livermore and met some of Heather's friends for Ice Cream. I really liked them all. I was so exhausted though that I kinda lost my spunk for the night. In saying that, I need to close this post and get some shut-eye. I am trying to take care of myself and get enough sleep so I think this is going to be it for tonight. The plans for tomorrow are to meet Heather's brothers and unsure of what else. Until tomorrow my friends, ~Shalom~

      Hello everyone. As you all know, I am going away for a few days to Northern California to see my friend Heather. I'm really excited about hanging with my girl and getting to see her "neck of the woods!" I am also getting some much needed time with Joel which will be so fun. He is the best! I am very excited about going. I am not sure if I will be able to blog while I am gone so I am going to say I am not. If I should, it will be a pleasant surprise!  Guys, I have to be honest with you, I am a little bit interested in my auto insurance guy. It is kinda crazy but true! He is quite the cutie though. He seems really cool too. We'll see though, it all takes time in my world. Overall, I am just focused on other things right now. I really have to take off from work right now, however, because I still have to go to the bank, go to target, and then go home and eat and pack. I have a lot to do before Joel picks me up. I can't wait to see him! I haven't been able to hang out with him for a while so I am totally looking forward to it.  Well, I am off for the day but keep me in prayer that I stay on task while I am away and mainly for a job to come around when I get back. Please keep me in your prayers loved ones! Love you all dearly! ~Shalom~

      Hi everyone. I didn't have too bad of an eating day yesterday. I did learn as&nbsp;a diabetic, however, I am in&nbsp;need of a snack around 3:00 p.m. I get low around that time every day. I think when I go home for lunch I will grab something to take back to work with me and then if I need it I'll eat it and if not, I won't. Here is my eating day for yesterday (July 28th)  Breakfast:  1/4 cup blueberries 1/4 cup raspberries 3 slices 97% fat free turkey (I needed some protein) 1 2 pts bar from weight watchers (for carbs)  1 one a day weight smart 1 iced water  *Note: I had an interesting morning yesterday with the housekeepers so I had to take breakfast on the go*  Lunch:  1 cheeseburger *grilled on George Foreman grill* w/ American cheese and pickle only 4 fresh strawberries  Afternoon Snack (3:00):  1 individual bag of Ritz bitz sandwiches with peanut butter  Dinner:  1 cheeseburger *Grilled on George Foreman grill* w/ American cheese and pickle only (need to use my ground beef) 1 sliced cucumber  2 slices cantaloupe  Snacks:  1 grilled cheese sandwich 3 slices cantaloupe 1/2 cup roasted salted almonds 1 cup cheez it crackers  I had the munchies last night but luckily I kept it pretty healthy!   Exercise:  None, I need to get it together. I am trying to think of a better time to work out because I am not working out at all right now!  I am not doing so hot just because I have not included exercise very well but hopefully I'll get it together! ~Shalom~

      Hey everyone. Yesterday worked out well for the most part. I had a hard day but either way I was mostly obedient. The only thing that went wrong was exercise because we lost power in EastBluff area for a couple of hours so I didn't get to do my "walk away the pounds" dvd. I don't know why exercise is so hard to incorporate! Here is my day:  Breakfast:  2 eggs scrambled with very little margarine 2 slices white toast w/ margarine 4-5 fresh strawberries 1 one-a-day weight smart 1 iced water  Lunch:  1 grilled cheeseburger (on George Foreman grill) w/ American cheese and pickle only 1/4 large grapefruit 1 slice cantaloupe 1 iced water  Dinner:  1 grilled sirloin steak (2-3 oz) *on George Foreman grill* 1/2 cup red roasted potatoes with rosemary & Garlic (no butter or oil) 1 green salad with iceberg lettuce and tomato w/ balsamic vinegarette 5 fresh strawberries 1 Seagrams Lime Margarita wine cooler  Snacks:  2 Large slices cantaloupe  1 banana 1 iced water  Exercise:  nothing because the power went out. I have to get my "rear in gear" or I will be maintaining this 232 lbs forever! Please pray for motivation and for me to just do it. I love to exercise but I drag my feet. I know it makes me feel better but something is more appealing about watching Will & Grace! *AHHHHH*  Well everyone, I am hoping to get better as the days progress and build new habits daily. Thanks for your prayers and ~shalom~

      Hey everyone! How are you all doing? I am so proud of myself because yesterday (July 22) I was able to eat exactly as I needed to. I also worked out so yipee for me. Let's hope this becomes practice and not just a one of a time glory. Here is my food log for yesterday:  Breakfast:  3 turkey sausage patties (about the size of a milk cap each) 2 slices of toast (white) w/ butter 1 banana 1 one a day weight smart 1 glass of iced water  Lunch:  1 cheeseburger (on George Foreman Grill) w/ American cheese and pickle only 4 large fresh strawberries 1 glass of iced water  Dinner:  1 grilled chicken breast seasoned  1 cup roasted red potatoes with garlic and rosemary (no butter or oil) Salad with iceberg lettuce and tomato w/ Balsamic Vinegarette 2 Large slices Cantaloupe  Snacks:  1 Large slice Cantaloupe 2 cups goldfish crackers (cheddar)  Exercise:  1 mile "walk away the pounds" 20 asymetrical lunges 10 platapus walks 20 pelvic tilts  Overall, it was a great healthy day. I also got about 8 hours of sleep. Hopefully health will be mine soon. I am doing so great so far but it's only been one day of eating three meals and working out. I am hoping to build a habit of good health here. Keep posted for Saturday's weigh in and of course to find out if I am staying on track. ~shalom~

      Well everyone, I am back home and for all intensive purposes starting fresh on my weight loss endeavors. As most of you know, I haven't been eating properly while I am at home and I ate too much on vacation. Basically I have a very unhealthy relationship with food all the way around and don't love myself enough chubby to take care of myself properly. I am starting a new way of being and hopefully these food logs are going to get much better. Here is yesterday's food log (July 21)   Breakfast:   Nothing   Lunch:   1/2 grilled chicken breast  Salad w/ greens, cucumbers, raisins&nbsp;and Balasamic vinegar  1 piece broccoli and cheese quiche  1 cup goldfish crackers  1 iced water   Dinner:   2 George Foreman grill burgers w/ cheese and pickle  3 large slices cantaloupe  1 iced water   Snacks:   Quaker oatmeal granola bar w/ raisins   Exercise:   None except at Babystyle before passing out   I had an ok day&nbsp;but I will be eating three meals from now on and implementing daily exercise. I am going to create a new exercise plan so that I can get my body in shape and toned.&nbsp; Keep logging on for news and weigh ins! ~Shalom~

      Colorado = no health for me! I have just eaten so poorly since being here but seriously, some of the best food I've had.

I need to get it together when I get home. I have to lose this extra weight! I really do hate it. Have a great day everyone and Love you all! ~Shalom~

      Hey everyone! This blog is for Thursday July 15th. I ate a little differently because I was travelling and I am pretty broke. I am now in Colorado so my eating habits might be different since I am on vacation and Josh is quite the eater. I am going to try to get Josh to take nightly walks with me though so I am not losing exercise. Well here is yesterday: &nbsp; Breakfast: &nbsp; 1 Sausage McMuffin with no egg  1 Iced water 1 one a day weight smart &nbsp; Lunch: &nbsp; Bagel w/ cream cheese 1 iced water &nbsp; Dinner: &nbsp; 1/2 order of Baked Ziti with extra cheese 5-6 breadsticks (this is really bad) &nbsp; Snacks: &nbsp; 1 brownie thing (Josh gave me this when I got here because I was starving) &nbsp; Exercise: &nbsp; None other than running through the airport to get to my terminal. &nbsp; I didn't do so great yesterday and probably won't do particulary beautifully this week due to being on vacation but I am going to try to at least exercise so I don't gain my 2 lbs back. I have no idea if I have lost any weight this week because I weigh in on Saturdays. I will weigh in here at Josh's because he has a scale. I hope you are all doing great on being healthy yourself. Have a great day ~Shalom~

      Yesterday was an interesting day. I was really bad about food because I skipped 2 meals. I got up in the morning and wasn't feeling into eating so I just went to work on an empty stomach. This wasn't good for me all the way around. I was just terrible yesterday but my weigh in is at the end of this blog so enjoy my good news!  Breakfast:  Nothing  Lunch:  Nothing  Dinner:   1 Grilled chicken breast (George Foreman Grill) 1 cup mashed potatoes w/ margarine 1 Salad with Balsamic Vinegarette 2 pieces cantaloupe  Snacks:  This is where it gets ugly because I was starving throughout the day   10 Chocolate Chip cookies (AHHHHH I know) *not all at once but throughout the night*  Todays weigh in which I do every Saturday:  Last Weigh In: 234 Today: 232  Hallelujah, I lost 2 lbs this week! I am so excited that I can hardly stand it. I am so glad that I am losing again. I think it's the new job and a lot more activity. Maybe the lack of food too. Please pray I get to start remembering my meals. I am starving at night because of my past paced life. Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!  ~Shalom~

      This post is for July 8, 2004. I did horrible yesterday and I really need to figure out how to accomodate for lunch. It seems I am terrible at this. Here is my food log for yesterday:  Breakfast:  2 eggs scrambled w/milk 2 slices white toast w/margarine 1 glass water 1 one a day weight smart  Lunch:  Nothing  Dinner:  1 Turkey Cheeseburger on bun w/ mustard 1 Turkey Hot dog on bun w/mustard 1 cup black olives 1 Margarita   Snacks:  2 squares colby jack cheese 2 Strawberry Pop tarts  Exercise: none intentionally...worked at BabyStyle all day  This day was a flop. I eat nothing for lunch so when I get home I am starving and I end up eating a great deal in the evenings. Baby style has made it where I don't have much energy to exercise so hopefully I'll include that in my schedule soon. Have a great day everyone!

      Please remember this is always a day behind as I don't get a chance to post dinner until the next day. Yesterday was a busy day with post-wreck back aches and being stressed about it. I didn't have a great eating day again. I am having trouble finding time to eat lunch and that isn't healthy for me. So far it isn't making me overeat for dinner but either way, I need to fit in lunch as I am starving at the end of the day. I need the energy. Here is my food log:  Breakfast:   2 Maple Sausage links 2 slices white toast w/margarine 1 glass water 1 one a day weight smart  Lunch:  Nothing  Dinner:   1 filet mignon 1 baked sweet potatoe w/margarine  Snacks:  2 Brown Sugar pop-tarts  Exercise:  None--worked at babystyle

      Oh my goodness people, it's a beautiful day here in Southern California. I don't know if its the beautiful weather, the fact I am completely blessed, or that I am 4 lbs lighter today!

I am hoping to be under 200 by Christmas so when I go home...noone will recognize me! HA HA.  Anyway, thanks for your prayers and ~shalom~

      Hey everyone. Yesterday was a big failure of a day in the weight loss world.

      Hello everyone. I am back from my vacation and I had a decent day yesterday on eating.

I am back now and on track!  ~Shalom~

      Hello everyone. I am actually posting this on August 4th but it should have been posted August 3rd. I just didn't have time to put it on here. This post is for Monday August 2nd and this is the day we went to San Francisco so everything should be going smoothly after this. I was staying at Heather's house so if things look a little strange, that's why.  Breakfast:  1 chocolate pudding 1 one a day weight smart 1 water  Lunch: (went out with mike)  1/2 sandwich on wheat at Togos Turkey and Avacado w/ no condiments Chef's salad with no dressing 1 water  Dinner:  Seafood pasta with Penne, scallops, shrimp, prawns, etc... 1 water 3-4 pieces of dinner bread w/ butter  We ate at this wonderful restaurant on the water so we ate nicely. Maybe overdid the bread a little but oh well, it's vacation.  Exercise:  Walked around San Fran.  Monday was decent but vacation really does mess up your eating habits.  ~Shalom~

      Considering I spent several hours in the car on the way to Northern California, I didn't do so bad yesterday on my eating habits. I am really running out of food in the house so my day was interesting with that being true. I had to work all day though so I must fuel myself. Here is my food log for Sunday:  Breakfast:  2 eggs scrambled with reduced fat 2% milk and margarine 2 slices white toast (lite bread) w/ margarine 1/2 grapefruit with splenda 1 one a day weight smart 1 iced water  Lunch:  97% Fat free turkey sandwich on wheat break with avacado 1 sliced cucumber fresh grapes 1 iced water  Dinner:  American cheese sandwich on wheat bread 1 baked yam with margarine fresh grapes 1 iced water  Snacks:  5-6 Pringles chips rancharageous flavor 3-4 peanut m&ms   Exercise:  Absolutely none since I was on my road trip.  Guys, I have to tell you something wonderful in my weight loss trek that occurred today. There is ONE man who I want to notice me. I will be honest, we all know who he is. Well, he noticed my weight loss yesterday and I was so happy about that.  I don't care if it means nothing to him because to be quite honest, it meant something to me. He said my goal is attainable and he was very supportive of me. I love him! I really do! :)  Well, I am hoping that I do ok in my eating habits while I am here in Northern California. So far, things are going ok.  Love you all and ~Shalom~

      Hi everyone. Since I am going out of town, I should note I am running out of groceries to prepare meals with. For that reason, my meals might seem a little odd. Here is yesterday's post (July 31, 2004)  Breakfast:  97% Fat free Turkey Sandwich on wheat w/ American Cheese and mustard Fresh blueberries 1 one a day weight smart 1 iced water  Lunch:  1 can campbells Chicken Noodle Soup (which is way too salty) 1 cup fresh blueberries  Dinner:  1 Filet mignon (bacon wrapped but I pulled it off after cooking) 1 baked yam w/ margarine 1/2 cup creamed spinach  Snacks:  1 individual bag of goldfish grahams 2 tablespoons milk chocolate morsels (I was having a bad chocolate night) 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1 cup cheez it crackers 2 Hershey Kisses @ library  (the snacks weren't all at once but boy did I snack yesterday!)  Exercise:  Walk the Walk --firming walk (It's a cardio workout with toning exercises. *About 30-45 minutes)  I was so glad that I worked out last night. I was getting to where I thought I would not do it again. I am hoping when I get back from my trip up north that I will start walking in the morning hours before work or even doing my videos before work. I need to start structuring my day better or the weight won't come off. I had a decent day yesterday other than the excessive snacking thing. I really am in need of chocolate this week (wink wink)  Have a great day everyone and ~Shalom~

      Hello everyone. I am happy to report that yesterday I did get exercise. It wasn't structured like a walk or a video but I went to the Orange County Fair for about 2 and 1/2 hours and walked around. That is defintely a mini-work out. I am hoping to get a work out tonight but we'll see. I have some things to do around the house and I need to pack for my trip to Nor. Cal. I am working 8 hours today and tomorrow in order to make up for time lost on Monday and Tuesday. I hope you all have a great weekend and thanks for your prayers as they are working! Have a great day!~Shalom~

      Hi everyone. I wish I could tell you I did some structured work out last night but let's be honest, I cleaned my room, did laundry, and did dishes (with a dishwasher). Although those things took time I probably didn't bust out any calories by doing it. I am hoping for a weight loss this week but being that I have only exercised ONCE I don't know if that will happen. Ok, well I guess that's it for today. Thanks for stopping in! ~Shalom~

      Yesterday was yet another flop. I am really going to have to make another time to exercise rather than at night. I am thinking about getting up in the morning and doing the workout or taking a walk in my neighborhood or something. I am kinda tired of getting too tired at night to work out and then waking up with guilt feelings about it. I have to start working out again or I am doomed to chubby forever! Please pray for me!~Shalom~

      Ok, yesterday was a flop. I need to use this blog as a forum today to gripe about myself. I have a horrible habit of waiting until late at night to exercise and in turn I get too tired and never do it. I have exercise one day this week....I mean, I know it's only Wednesday but I am not going to lose any lbs by not doing anything. I might lose a pound or so by cutting my food intake and trying to be deliberate about using more steps and drinking more water but eventually I'll stop losing simply because I am not moving enough. I am discouraged with myself. Tonight I have to make time to work out. I would really like to do this walk away the pounds video I have called FIRMING walk. I need to do some firming. Please pray I can get my huge butt in gear! Thanks and ~shalom~

      I actually exercised last night!!!! WOO HOO. I am so glad that I actually got motivated and got busy last night. Yesterday's routine was supposed to be cardio and arms so I did:  1 mile walk away the pounds that includes upper body work-out  I was so proud of myself for getting busy! Thanks for your prayers and thanks for stopping in! ~Shalom~

      I really had everything ready to go to exercise last night and then the unbelievable occured. I had the jogging pants &amp; sports bra out, the dvd sitting on the dresser and I was finishing up my friend calls for the evening when the power went out in my beautiful neighborhood. I finally got the guts to go upstairs and try to find a flashlight and went out the front door to find that there was no power on at least the whole block. I went ahead and got in the car and came to the library and hung out here so I had air and power. I went back home when the power was back on and found that I was too tired to "walk away the pounds" so let's hope I get in gear because I really need to lose these pounds this week. I am looking for a 2 lb weight loss this week. Keep praying ya'll ~shalom~

      This post is for yesterday and I have some bad news. I didn't work out at all last night. I was tired so I just went to bed and tried to sleep in but something pretty horrible went down today so I am going to have to take a mid-day nap to be able to accomplish the hours of sleep that are necessary for me to be healthy. Even though I have had a hard morning, I did have breakfast and I am going to go home for lunch and try to eat something nutritious. I am really trying to care about myself and get myself to be healthy, lose weight, and be financially stable. I hope you all are having a great day and ~shalom~

      This exercise journal will be one day behind just like my food journal because I have to write the next day after I have already completed it. Yesterday was my first day on my new schedule and I was pretty proud of myself. This is what exercise I did:  1 mile "walk away the pounds"  20&nbsp;asymetrical lunges 10 Platapus walks 20 pelvic tilts  The exercises were all butt exercises so hopefully they will help me tone and eliminate the cellulite&nbsp;that we all know and love. It made me sore&nbsp;so that's always a good sign. Tonight the plan is some cardio and&nbsp;flexibilty training.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really praying to be able to stay on track and change my body over the next couple of months. I would like to lose an&nbsp;average of 8 lbs a month. That makes&nbsp;me getting to goal weight by September of next year! I really would like to be there. God&nbsp;help me!   Well, that's it for today. Keep me in prayer so I can stay on track. I will be adding a weight loss page to my web-site soon&nbsp;so I can keep before pictures and&nbsp;after pictures going on there. Enjoy! ~Shalom~&nbsp;

Here is the course of action for getting myself in shape and toned.  Monday:  Cardio (30-45 minutes) Arms  Tuesday  Cardio (30-45 minutes) Abs  Wednesday   Cardio (30-45 minutes) Legs  Thursday  Cardio (30-45 minutes) Buns  Friday  Cardio (30-45 minutes) Stretching  Saturday   Just Cardio (1 hour or more)  Sunday:  Day off from exercise  If anyone has any comments on what they think about my exercise plan, please email me at  urlLink ericak849@aol.com    I am thinking this is healthy and once I build it into a habit I should be getting healthier and dropping pounds. Please keep me in prayer to get my eating and exercise habits in place. Thanks! ~Shalom~

      Yesterday was another disobedient day. I didn't work out at all and I really need to bust out some cardio. I am feeling like a stubborn girl because I get home and I just want to chill but I really need to spend my 45 minutes or so and just work out. Please pray I will start to realize that. I can't lose all this weight by just food choices...I have to work out. Thanks everyone and ~Shalom~

      Hey everyone. I am finally back on the wagon with exercise. I got home last night rather late but I decided it could not continue any further. I had to work out. I did the walk the walk firming video and once again...it kicked my butt. I was so sore and tired afterward I just went straight to bed. I don't think you are supposed to do that but I was bushed. It has an upper body workout, lower body work out, and ab/trunk work out. It's hard. I am starting to see my body sculpting a little bit so I am stoked about that. Tonight I am going to try to get some cardio out so that I can burn more calories. Things are so far going well. I will keep you all posted and thanks for stopping by! ~Shalom~

      Ok, I have no structured exercise to report at all. I went bowling with Jaylie in the afternoon and bowled two games so I am sure I got a little upper body workout but other than that..nothing. I am promising my blogging audience that tonight I will be working out in a structured manner. I am so undisciplined and distracted. I have to get it together. ~Shalom~

      I didn't do anything especially exerting yesterday. I walked around Home Depot for a little bit and I was with Joel so he walks really fast but other than that..I was kinda lazy. I need to get back on the wagon with exercise because if I miss one day ...I will miss a week. Today I am taking Jaylie bowling so that will be some moderate exercise. I am hoping to get a video in too because I need to firm. Thanks for your prayers and for stopping by! ~Shalom~

      It was friday the 13th yesterday and nothing horrible really happened to me. I didn't exercise yet again. I am not really eating enough to exercise right now. I am having a horrible time wanting to eat. I am eating out of obligation which is something I have always wanted to do but now it's out of hand. I don't seem to EVER want to eat. I am only eating enough to get by. I bought a new work out video yesterday so let's hope I start doing it. I went home and viewed it last night and it looks fun as it's hip hop dancing. So I am hoping that next week will look better as exercise goes but we'll see. Thanks for your prayers as I am 4 lbs down this week at 224 lbs. Have a great day and ~Shalom~

      I am getting sick of myself. Yesterday I barely ate anything and didn't exercise at all. I know this isn't the way to be healthy so I am going to try to get into a schedule soon of what to do. I really need to care for myself above all things right now. Exercise will hopefully be picking up. One of my friends got me a borders giftcard for my b-day and I am trying to finish Atlas Shrugged so I didn't want to buy a book and I bought a work out tape that is also a hip hop dance tape. That should be good for me so let's hope I get it down and start working out better. Thanks for your prayers and ~Shalom~

      Yeah I am a bad girl. I didn't work out last night. I had a very interesting thing happen and I was very preoccupied with that. I really need to bust out some cardio though or I will be gaining and defintely not losing. Please pray I get in gear because I am just getting distracted and not getting it done. It's only 45 minutes of my time so you would think I could handle it. ~Shalom~

      I am seriously a deviant. I decided last night to do NOTHING in the realm of exercise which is no good. I was supposed to do a cardio workout which would have been good for me but I was bad and didn't do it. Let's hope I get my butt in gear tonight and get crackin on working out because I have to make goal next week. The pounds are coming off people...I made goal this week so I am not quitting here. Please pray I get myself in gear! Thanks and ~Shalom~

      Hi everyone. Thanks for stopping in to my exercise log for the day. I am doing really well on building my exercise habits. I have decided to change my plan a bit and start doing something new. I decided that I would do cardio every other day and then firming every other day so exercising 7 days a week (Cardio 4 days, firming 3 days or vice versa) I did really well last night as I did the firming video of the Walk the Walk series. It is so good for my body to firm it. I am always really fatigued after it so that means it is still challenging me. I figure when it starts getting easy I will add more weight for the upper body workout and add ankle weights to the lower body workout and abs will always be challenging since the mid section is my worst section. Make sure and stop in to my weight loss blog today...big news on there! Have a great day and ~Shalom~

      Hi everyone. I have been obedient to my plan 2 days in a row. Last night I did 2 miles on the walk away the pounds video series. It was really hard on me so I have to get used to doing it. I am used to the one mile but the two mile is way more. I felt good after it though and I am hoping I burned some serious calories. I have been getting used to my new eating habits so hopefully I can get used to my new exercise habits soon too. Thanks for stopping in and keep praying ~Shalom~

      Hello everyone. Yesterday I was obedient in my exercise endeavors. I worked out last night to Walk the Walk firm walk. This video does a warm up, upper body workout with weights, lower body work out, and then an ab/trunk work out. It's quite challenging and my abs are kinda sore today. I am feeling pretty good about working out and I am hoping to go home tonight and bust out some cardio. I am hoping I can stay on task being that a lot of things are taking my time and effort right now. Thanks for stopping in everyone and ~shalom~

I didn't really exercise at all on Sunday because I went to work all day and then came home and got ready for my trip to Nor. Cal. I am at Heather's right now. I spent several hours sitting on my butt in Joel's car so I was very inactive on Sunday. Please pray when I get back to So. Cal that I can really get in gear. Thanks guys and ~Shalom~

      Happy Sunday everyone. I am happy to report I actually did work out last night. I came home from work and started dinner while I cleaned up things in the house. I ran 2 loads of dishes, 3 loads of laundry, and cleaned up minor things in my room. After dinner I did the Walk the Walk --firming walk. This video includes a little cardio to get you pumped and then goes into toning. It works your arms with weights, it works your legs (inner and outer thigh both) and then it also works your trunk or ab area. It's quite a workout and I can sorta feel it today. I am hoping that Heather and I will find some way to incorporate exercise into our two days together although she doesn't need any. I am going to work out after dinner tonight before heading off for Nor. Cal because Joel and I will be in the car for several hours and I don't want to not use any energy. Keep me in prayer as I am travelling and need some exercise while I am gone. If I don't get the opportunity to post up there, I will do it when I get back for the days I am there. I will keep good records. This blog is helping me to stay accountable. I want to record that I exercised so it makes me get motivated. Have a great day everyone and ~Shalom~
