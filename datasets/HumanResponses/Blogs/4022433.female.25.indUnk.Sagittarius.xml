       So Hello. My name is Tracey and I live here in Topeka, Kansas with my husband of five years and my twin daughters who are 4. Later you will do the math and realize something is a little fishy and it is. But we can get into that later.  I imagine at some point you will have the pleasure of hearing from my hubby, Ashley, (his real name is Steven but goes by Ashley and I still don't understand why) and will enjoy his take on things. But right now it is my turn to take the floor. My daughters Victoria and Samantha might even provide some content, so be warned.  Right now I suppose I should explain the zoo reference. Well to those who know us, you know how things are here but you might not understand my choice of zoo for our family. So here is how it is.  Four and half years ago when my girls were just tiny little things that fit in Ashley's hand, they used to grip on to the front of our shirts and just hang there and sleep. Which lead to the nickname of monkeys. Now that they are four and spend most of their lives in perpetual motion, swinging between things, they still have the rightful nickname of monkeys.  My nickname has been turtle for as long as I can remember. I believe it had something to do with my tendency to be rather methodical and patient (or maybe cause I am so damn slow). Anyway I have quite a collection of turtle items, and am proud to say to have a nickname I am not ashamed of. (another thing that will be explained at a later time)  Now my husband has no animal nickname and if I was to give him one I might have to sleep on the couch for awhile. But I would compare him with two animals...One would be a rhino, because they have the tendency to be a little cranky and unfriendly when bothered. The other would be a Labrador who are loyal, loving, protective, and just really cute. That sounds kind of chess but those would be some the best characteristics about him and the reason I fell in love with him.&nbsp;Of course when I told him just now what I was comparing him to he had a few choice names for me too.  So anyway now you know where the zoo reference started but what pushed to the front of my mind was thinking about married life and life with a family. Things are pretty routine, work, family, church, play, so on and so forth. We don't get out much and we have a real small area in which we move. But don't get me wrong, this is the life we love and are happier then we have ever been. I look at those around us who are miserable and unhappy, who spend all there time&nbsp;struggling out there for survival. And I have all I need right here in my own Zoo. Plus people would pay good money to see us in our habitat.
