      Hey Guys,   Okay, just something I want to clear up. I din realise the whole fess about today's meeting at Starbucks until Nick called me in the morning. Sorry, I haven't been updating myself by checking the blog.   But this is why only 4 pple were initially called to attend the meeting: At our last meeting at school with the teachers when we discussed about the next meeting, the teachers wanted it to be a small meeting because they just wanted to take a look at the video and the overview of the games. So only the key members were required to be there. Myself, Fuzz and Julius were in-charge of the video, exhibition and screening of projects (as discussed at the first meeting), and Nick was in charge of the games. So naturally Nick was supposed to know everything about the games and stuff. But when he called me this morning, and said he didn't, that's when I said ok, call Simren too.   Sorry about the mess up.   As for manpower, thanks Hal and Yatt. Myself and Fuzz have started calling people up. Hopefully we have enough people.   See all of you at 1.30 at LT 50 on Tuesday. Someone pls inform Lianne and whoever else who doesn't know. Thanks.

Got to get black vanguard sheet, plastic sheets, blu-tack, and also have to zap some of the descriptions behind each art and design project piece to paste below the piece.   Alright. 6 days more to orientation day. Happening sial.

      Waddup people!  First up, what's happenin during the treasure hunt today? Give us low down.  Ok. Me, Julz, Van & Nick will be meeting the teachers on Friday.  Guys, please meet at Starbucks outside California gym near heeren shops at 11am. Dont come late and make up stupid excuses. No time already.  Hopefully, after that, we'll have a committee meeting during the weekend.   no, die die have to have meeting with entire committee during weekend.  We'll have to call up all volunteers during the weekend as well. I think Brian Lee & I will be gg down to Starhub come saturday to discuss the sponsorship thingamajigs.  Van, update on editing?  Halawah, I need you to come up with a list of no of manpower needed for registration. Inculde 'floaters' in case the year 1s get lost. Ushers also needed in LT. Not too many since there are already OGLs.  Treasure hunt- Exact nos. needed for manpower.  Logistics & technical... i think we'll get the video production crew to help w technical. I doubt there'll be alot of work for them, but let em come for the fun of it and to watch their hard work. Something like that. You get what i mean. confirm logistics.  That's it. Anything, gimme a call at home at 62410358. And if you happen to be around and see the new hippo bus. ill prolly be on it. fucking hell.  till later! cheers!

      Hi guys,  Everything seems good, turning out as scheduled, yes? Hahas got to know that the video production was fun - and kudos to Vanessa for editing it. I know, editing can be a bitch. But from what I've gathered, the video will be a blast! =p I've already gotten hold of the vcd of one of the fsv yr 1 videos. Feedback-ed to Lianne on the icebreakers stuff as well. Just to check the logistics stuff, has Julius contacted Wendy Wee and Mr Siew already for the artdsn & photog showcase? The games side (icebreakers, scavenger hunt) looks good and all set, so can someone (Simren?) coordinate with me and Ika on the logistics? Need to know if we have all the 'barang2' ready. As well as the screening stuff, if we're screening it on a lappy (audio tracks on cd, videos on vcd).   Cheers!

      Thanks everyone (but Van, Ika & Julz) for  not  turning up for the meeting today.   Anyhow. here's the low down- basically everything as we have planned it is approved. Me, Van, Julius (& Ika?) currently working on the video and all the shizzo there is to it. We'll be having a meeting w a couple of cast and crew members tmr but i guess the rest of you guys need not attend.   The proposed date to film is this friday. It'll be in school, but more about that aft tmr's meeting, I guess.   Treasure Hunt  We didnt exactly discuss this just now, but do you think it'll be cool for the Treasure Hunt I/Cs to plan and organize the actual treaure hunt itself? I would prefer if the video production & planning of treasure hunt would be gg on simultaneously since we don't exactly have all the time in the world.  Please kindly take note that we will have a final meeting with the advisors with everything (including puzzles, etc.) on  Friday, 18th June . I think that the trial run for the treasure hunt should be done before we meet the teachers, no?  We will mobilize the troops (heh.) on  22nd June .  Of course, on 23rd June, yours truly will finally turn legal!  And 24th will be  THE  day!  Lianne, you're IC of Ice Breakers? Havent heard anything from you yet. I think we need some games that we can actually brief the OGLS with, so tt they'll have a brief idea, no?  And mcm guys, i seem to be having trouble getting info to you, and if i msg all including the fms society peeps, my bill will just hit the roof, big time. so i thought we'd do a forwaring chain. here's how it'll go.  i'll msg halawah- simren - wilson - lianne - francis.  ill msg jingwen & sashi as well. any discrepancies whatsoever, holler at the tagboard, but if it's all good, then ill see you guys real soon.
