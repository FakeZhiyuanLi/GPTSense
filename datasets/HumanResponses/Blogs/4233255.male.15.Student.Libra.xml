       So I just wrapped up my first week at school and it, for the most part, sucks arse. Everything is uber-strict, friendly visits are rare, and outsiders (all us MSHies) are apparently looked down upon. If it weren't for the great academics, I'd give the school a big  (WT) F.     I MISS MSH!!!!!! =(

        EBloggy seems to have fallen off the face of the web, so I guess this is my new home for blogging. You can see my older entries from the blog   here.       More posts to come...

      Here's the official story on that tragedy I described below, taken from 11Alive's webpage:     "Two teens were killed and a third was critically injured in a fiery crash early Saturday morning in Fulton County.  William Daunte Zenoni, 17, lost control of his car on a curve on Glen Errol Road at about 12:30 Saturday morning. The car hit a mailbox and a metal sign before bursting into flames.  “There was a guy trying to pull out a guy that was stuck, so we ran up to the house across the street to try to get some water, but the house didn’t reach,” said witness Charles Ellis. “Then we filled a trash can and dumped it on the kid, but by that time it looked like it was hopless.”  Zenoni died at the scene. Passenger Emily Wyatt, 14, was airlifted to Grady Memorial Hospital where she later died. The car’s other passenger, Neil Patel, 15, was transported to Atlanta Medical center and was listed in critical condition Saturday evening."

        My neighbor just called and said that three Freshman who went to North Springs died in a car accident last night about 1 AM. One girl, Emily Wiatt (sp?) was from her church. Apparently none of the five people in the car wore seatbelts (u_u;;) and they were going 80-90mph on a NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, crashed into a mailbox, and the driver was killed on contact. The Emily girl was also killed near instantly and the third victim is brain dead at Grady Hospital. The other two kids in the backseats escaped and pulled the bodies out before the car exploded.    Oh yeah, and   none of them had Driver's Liscences  ! >_>    Truly sad story. Just serves as a lesson that you should a.) drive safely, b.) make sure you're certified to be behind the wheel and c.) wear your seatbelts! Got that, kids?

       Yesterday morning I ever so convieniently struck my glasses (which were on the nightstand) with my elbow, disfiguring them. They lasted through the day with the only hassle being adjustments every so often. Then, in a stupid OCD moment around dinnertime, I tried to adjust the side frame and....CRACK! That part snapped off. I tried superglue, but it would take the night to dry.       Woke up this morning half-blind and tried on the newly repaired pair of glasses. They sorta fit, but my mom and I figured we should just get a new pair. I took the day off from school, basically under neccessity, to get new frames.      So now I have a new pair of glasses and my first absence of the school year, on a day with two tests, nonetheless. Oh well, not like I could've gone to a packed, pushy school with crap vision. =/      Oh yeah, played a demo of Pikmin 2 at WalMart, and it kicks ass. Just what I need, more games I'll buy this fall... I NEED A JOB!!!! U_U

       I'm actually happy today. I had a decent enough day in school (I learned two new peoples names! u_u;;) and right now I'm kicking back and finishing my homework. Which I REALLY need to start doing...hehehheh.....grades aren't up to snuff IMO. I'm hoping the weekend will be awesome though. Gonna have a party and maybe see Collateral.  The latest Game Informer has some neat articles in it this month, but of particluar interest to me is a six-page feature on Mech Assault 2. I didn't really like the first one that much, but that was mostly due to repetitous goals and stuff. With the addition of shinier graphics and fully destructable stuff, and being able to traverse outside your mech with a jetpack and jack any vehicle (be it tanks, mechs, or gunships) the game is looking to be the first great game of '05. (comes out 1/15/05 BTW... ;D)  Ah...can't wait for the end of the month...Phantom Brave, Star Ocean 3.....yummy. ^_^  Later.

        So, I've basically spent the weekend catching up on all my lost sleep and doing absolutely nothing. Unfortunately, the world goes on without me so today is chore day for me! Goody... >_> Hopefully I'll have time to either go mini-golfing or see Collateral. Speaking of which, that movie looks freakin' awesome. I love intelligent thrillers and badarses so it looks to be a great flick. Some of my friends confirm this, so I have to see it! ^_^    Gah...I still have some homework to catch up on, and then that stupid collage, but I just want to kick back! It's not fair!!!!!! I mean, I know it's just the first week and all, but I seriously dislike (not hate =P) North Springs. I mean, you know there's a problem when your only new friend is a teacher! XD    Oh well, back to work so I can finish this stuff in time to DO SOMETHING! Later....

      I wanted to go mini-golfing today, but the place I love to go to went out of business.... ='( My runner up activity involved going to see Collateral, but according to a few sites, there are 20+ f-words spoken. I mean, I can stand a lot of profanity, and even an occasional f-word, but 20+ in two hours!? Over-freakin'-kill.  So now I'm bored. Someone suggest a good webgame or activity.  I wanna do something!!!!
