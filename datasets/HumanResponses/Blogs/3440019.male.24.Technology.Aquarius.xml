         Nowadays getting a car let alone a two wheeler has become very easy. There are banks thonging to give you loans and sometimes we can even bargain on the rate of interest. Everyday there will be calls from some bank or the other making an offer for a car loan.    But their is one question. How do we categorise driving/riding? Is it a pleasure or a pain? Most of us would agree it is more of pain than pleasure. The reason cannot be attributed to the bad roads alone, which many say are nothing but connected potholes, but to the attitude of the drivers.     I do not deny the fact that the condition of roads are very bad and causes a lot of traffic jams. But there are good roads too where traffic jams and slow moving traffic take place. The reason is us drivers. How many of us actually follow all the rules laid down by the traffic police? How many of us honk unnecessaily while waiting for the red light to change or in a slow moving traffic knowing very well that they cannot go any faster?    This is not done by only the uneducated people but by the so called 'educated' people, the graduates, post-graduates. There are instances where the signal is red, the traffic police is not present and we break the rule. We drive rash and create problems for the other drivers. The reason is we get the 'Kick' out of this. On top of this is the drunk driving. People are least bothered if the drunk drivers die in an accident as they deserve it but what about the people who are the victimes of these drunken monks.    The latest is teenagers driving without licence. What are the parents of these children think they are doing? They are playing with both the lives of their children and the others. Have they no conscience or moral that they are breaking the law they have accepted to abide by.    People sometimes drive as if they are in a race even in residential areas where they very well know that they have to curtail their speeds to the maximum.   When rains come God save the pedestrains from the splashes we drivers create while wading through the rain waters. Can't we be considerate. Are we such barbarians?    This is utterly insane. Don't we have the slightest responsibility to uphold the law. On top of this we always say that the police harrass the people. I don't say this never happens but if we abide by the law the police will most probably not harrass us. If we are caught the first thing we do is negotiate a bribe with the police. When we do that we don't think that the polce has lost all respect for us. When I was caught for a wrong turn I paid the fine in whole and apologised and the inspector was also very kind and apologised for the trouble they supposedly to have caused. I think everyone has the duty to uphold the law and should not blame the police alone. Only then can we make driving a pleasure.    Thanks once more for your patience and please comment on will. Thanks.

         The "Capital Punishment" is under scrutiny all over the world for a long time and it has just started in India. There is a section of the society that favours abolishment of this ultimate punishment while another section favours refinement by changing the age old form of death sentence by hanging to that of the lethal injection or the gas chamber.    Why should death sentence be abolished? The reasons put forward by some are it is inhumane and no one including the government has the right to kill someone. But there are instances wherein the accused should be given this punishment so that he does not return back to his roots and starts his assault on the society. Should rapists, serial killers, hitmen, drug smugglers, political criminals, spurious drug producers be let off with a life sentence which is just for 14 years? Should the people who have made money or has had pleasure at the cost of others lives be let off with such a soft punishment? They have played with people's lives, with their trust, and with their faith. Such people should not be given a chance to come back as they have committed crimes without any conscience and not under the compulsions of the situation.    But the refinement of this capital punishment can be looked into. But again we have to sentence criminals to death by hanging based on his crime as he should also feel the pain which his victims have experienced. But on the overall we can shift to death by lethal injection. But the final word should be that capital punishement should not be abolished.    As usual I thank you all for the patience. Please feel free to comment. Thanks

         There are questions that everyone has in their lives. But all of these questions are about their lives. I too have such questions. The answers for most of these questions will be hidden in some clues depending on the path we have chosen in life. But I have some questions the answers for which don't have the slightest clue and I feel I will never get the answers for them.   Just think why is there something as a universe? why are we on this earth and why earth in particular? What is the motive of live? Why should we exist? Why should all the creatures evolve? Why should there be a concept of "survival of the fittest"? Why should there be a concept called time? Why should the universe expand? Why should we struggle to make our lives comfortable? Why should we eat to survive? If materialistic desires bring suffering why should we all have materialistic desires in the first place? Is this somekind of dream we all are having and are we going awakr from this dream? if we are dreaming where are we actually and why are we there all? Why is there a concept of fear? Is courage nothing but the fine concealment of fear? Why is everything getting so complicated around us? Why are there different blood groups among us? Why are there 5 senses and "navarasas"?    There are some more questions which I cannot put into words. But I am getting a very strange feeling and sense of uneasyness as I am writing this. If any of you can answer this please help me.   As usual I thank you for your patience and please feel free to comment.

         The general elections have concluded and we have a new government headed by one of the most prominent personality in India, Dr. Manmohan Singh. But let us do an introspection on the elections.     How many of us have cast our vote? According to the statistics, around 50-60% of the total indian population have cast their votes (figures are not accurate). This is a extremely bad electoral percentage. We can accept if the uneducated people are the main cause (which itself is unpardonable) for this low turnout. But the cause is us so called 'Educated Mass'.     What is the reason? People cannot say they don't have the time as by law even the private establishments have to give them a day off to allow their employees to cast their vote. Some people take advantage of the fact that some of our names were missing from the voters list and say they did not vote due to this reason (which in many cases is false but stated as an excuse). Should we only be bothered of our names figuring in the list at the time of elections? Why don't we make it a point to update the change of addresses to the revenue offices (this is where I had to go to see if my name was there or not)? In the case where our names are genuinely missing from the list due to the carelessness of the officials take this matter seriously even after the elections. This issue which was very much prevalent in this just concluded elections has pretty much died down.    On top of all this we criticise everything which is bad going on now in the country. What gives us the moral right to talk about the government? We have failed to exercise our right to choose our government, hence we are not part of this democracy. When we are not how can we question the actions of the government?     We also criticise that there are criminals in politics. But mind you there were a lot of other good people who actually fought the elections but lost because the people who knew him to be good did not vote. Therefore, how do we expect that good people will come to politics. This leads to another topic of politics being the sewere and we should stay away from it. But that is different and I will write on this later.    My sincere request is please enroll yourselves in the electorals. Keep your change of addresses updated in the electorals. Fight the bad and enable the good with your strength to win. Let us help in building a new India and take it to the height of glory.   Thanks again for your patience. Please feel free to add your comments.

         There is a lot said about influence of media. It is said that people get influenced very easily and can be easily manipulated by the media, especially films. But the fact is they are not.     When there is something bad happening, for example, people acting violently, it is always attributed to the so called 'Bad Influence' of films. This is absolute crap. Films not only show violence but also the ill-effects of violence. It is said that violence is glorified in films so it has its influence. But so is a Hero fighting corruption (by refusing to pay/accept bribes), evil forces, educated young and good people entering politics, societal illeffects (more aptly defects). How come this is always ignored?? Please let me know how many of us have actually changed for the better after watching the movies. We accept people kissing on the screens, exposing vulgarity and few of us are ready to do the same in our lives.    We see Kamal, Rajinikanth, Amitabh, and the others fighting corruption, trying to make India a better place to live in. I ask those who claim to be ardent followers of these Heroes as to how many have actually chosen this path. I say, there are none.     This is shameful. On top of all this we also curse that our country will never improve or the society is cruel. This is utter stupidity as we are also part this society and country. We have no moral right to either criticise the media nor curse or crib about the state of affairs in our country or the society. We have the moral right to talk about this only if we follow it ourselves.    Please consider and inculcate the good things that are conveyed even in the so called 'Extremely worthless, bad' movies as every movie has some good message hidden somewhere. This is a sincere request.    I only hope this will help us realise our follies and atleast try to change so that our country can positively and surely become a great country and more important make better individuals out of us. As for me I am trying to learn the good portrayed on the big and small screen.    This is solely my personal opinion. Please feel free to post the comments on my debut weblog. Thanks for your patience.

         I am back after a long break. I am sure none was waiting for my blog though my expectations are so. Anyway, I am back and this time it is not any social issue but philosophy. This one is a very short one.    I was talking to my colleague on the way back home and there was a huge argument between us as whether life is destined to be the way it is or whether we have any say in this.     When we make a decision is it that we are destined to take that decision or is it really us making the decision? Is everything decided for us when we were born or does life take twists and turns based on our decisions?     I am of the opinion that my life was already decided and I am just walking along the path we have chosen. But then again I get this doubt. If my life is decided long before why are there this feelings of hate, anger, betrayal, etc. in my life. This also contradicts the theory of rebirth, which is actually caused by our bad deeds in our current life.    So any takers to help me on this question?    Once again I thank you all for your patience. As usual feel free to comment.

         After a long life of academics myself and most of my friends have finally entered professional life and are about to start a career that is going to span a minimum of 35 years (least as to say). We have all gone through or will shortly go through the process of signing an agreement and obviously we would havfe read it and quite thoroughly too.     But there was one clause which actually put me off. The one about losing the job if convicted of a crime. This I think is utterly unfair.    I am not saying that all criminals should be allowed to retain their jobs but that this clause should be applicable on a case to case basis. What if I have killed somebody in self-defence or in defence of somebody else or I killed somebody by accident? I will still lose my job because I am convicted. There should be some respite to this. I have effectively done nothing wrong morally. Infact I have been on the side of justice all the time. But I will be shown injustice by getting fired.If I have committed the crime for my personal gain then yes, I deserve to be shown the door.    The companies talk of social responsibility and they do some good social work. But this too is a social responsibility. I am not saying that all companies should give even the pickpocketers, chain snatchers, thieves a chance which they should as society shoud give them a chance for rehabilitation (which is another topic altogether). But they should realize this folly and rectify it. But unfortunately this is not happening and unfortunately I too have accepted this clause. You can say that I have no right to talk on this as I am a part of it but this was just a thought on my part and I will definitely atleast talk about this to my HR.    Once again I thank you all for your patience and feel free to comment.

         Another two months and the Olympics will start. Will this be another year where instead of searching for a medal we search for the gold or will it be the same story? This is the question on the minds of the sports enthusiasts in India or atleast I have that question in my mind.     Why is this dearth of sportspersons in India? What can be done to overcome this? I think many know the answers but I will put my theory in perspective.     The reason is the outlook of the parents. If I go upto my parents and tell them that I want to be a sports person their first reaction would be to discourage me and if I insisted and they have some modern outlook they will say that I can do anything as long as my studies don't get affected. Even teachers in schools tend to discourage sports naming them as a waste of time. Secondly, the government is also to blame as they are not publicising the schemes which are there which can be availed by sportspersons. Thirdly, even if the parents agree the society will discredit a person trying to reach heights in sports by saying he/she is always goofing and fit for nothing. Even though this outlook is slowly changing we still have to go a long way.    The solution to this is that the government should publicise the schemes for the sportspersons and increase them. Secondly, People should accept sport as a profession. This can happen only through awareness. The schools should promote sports. No school without a proper ground should be recognised.    I have also heard the sports people say they don't have enough facilities. This is true but they can't put up their hands and accept defeat. A true sportsperson is one who succeeds by crossing all obstacles. Take Kenya for example. The marathon runners practice cross country everyday in the heat and don't expect the government for everything.     The media should also reduce the hype on cricket and give more attention to other sports too. Only then will people take to other sports. Only then will India be a force to reckon with in the Sporting World.    Thanks for your patience and please feel free to comment.

         This time my weblog is not going to talk about social responsibility, duty etc. I think you all must have been bored. This time it is about courage.  What is courage? Some say it is concealment of fear. If you can hide fear well then you are courageous and brave. Some say it is in the genes. Some say it is the way you are brought up. If you are brought up in a way so that you are never exposed to confrontations and even if you are confronted by a rowdy you are asked to stay away from him. Which one is true I am not sure.     Some go to the extent saying courage is of two kinds. One - the courage you show in life to overcome the various failures in life to succeed, which we call the strength of mind. Two - to fight back when somebody assaults you, the physical strength.  Some say the rowdies or bullies are hiding their fear of failure in life by trying to show courage by bossing over the others and showing that they are superior.     But whatever said courage is a combination of both physical and mental strength. Most of us can take failure in life in stride and be successful but how courageous are we when encountering a thief or dacoit or any anti social element.If they can sense fear in us we are dead but if we can instill fear in them then we win the battle. That is what happens when we are encountered by a thief or so as fear is instilled in us.     Therefore, I conclude that concealment of fear is courage and nothing more. As usual please feel free to comment and thanks for your patience.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; These days I am so workless all sorts of questions seem to prop up in my head every minute. Talk about  idle's mind devil's workshop.  Anyway, coming back to the topic. &nbsp;&nbsp; We always say that absence of light is darkness. Why don't we ever say that absence of darkness is light? Therefore, I am in utter confusion as to whether light is prevalent everywhere or darkness is. There is also another view as to both darkness and light are 2 mutually exclusive entities. Please enlighten me on this. &nbsp;&nbsp; I hope nobody has the urge to kill me on reading this.  &nbsp;&nbsp; As one of the ardent bloggers put it as a comment in my previous blog I will include my  'signature'  in this blog. As usual, I thank you for your patience and please feel free to comment.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;  I am back again after a break. I seem to be taking too many breaks. This should not mislead anybody that I am busy at work but understand my laziness. Let us come back to the topic in hand - my convocation. I am actually inspired by my good friend's blog   urlLink   recursivesindhanai    &nbsp;and decided that I too should have a blog on us obtaining our Post Graduate Diploma in IT degree.    &nbsp; This is more on the people with whom I have spent 2 wonderful years and how they have influenced me. This is more of a tribute to them.    &nbsp; In IIITB (Indian Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore) I not only learnt the academic syllabus, but also the art of learning on my own and continue learning. This is largely due my peers. They helped me gain a footing in the field of IT.    &nbsp;&nbsp; Many of them have ended up with grades which mislead their intelligence and knowledge. There way of thinking, their attitude (both towards life and academics) were simply stunning and awe filled.    &nbsp;&nbsp; My friend   urlLink   enkirukkal    &nbsp;has got a great thinking mind and was even feliciatated for his work on a   tamil search engine  . Another great person was a silent genius.   urlLink   Wisiwug    &nbsp;was a great coder and wonderful at analysing.&nbsp;  urlLink   Recursivesindhanai    &nbsp;is a great logical thinker.    &nbsp;&nbsp; Every individual who studied with me had some great aspect or the other. Each had his own strength. Some were hardworking beyond imagination, while some could think so different that they couls solve problems that I had no idea about, some were intelligent, while some inherited some of all these attributes. This is too small a place to list eveyone and enumerate his strengths.   &nbsp;&nbsp; It was a great pleasure to study with such good people.

        Back again. Anybody missed me? Guess not.   Anyway, corruption is very much prevalent in India and it is clearly shown in the UNHDP report which positions India at a low 127th position in Human Development Index.   But have we ever considered why is corruption there and why should it be considered bad/wrong? I will try and justify corruption. Let us have a view point from the persons taking bribes.    Everyone (well most of us) of us feels that we deserve to be paid more for the work we do and so do the government officials. In our case we talk to our higher ups and eventually get a hike (and one we are happy with), but it is not that easy in the case of govt. officials. Therefore, they directly ask the public and get more remuneration. It is a form of commission to them for the services they have rendered. So what is wrong in this? Therefore, their way is also right.   But there are other short commings with the officials which I am obviously not going to discuss atleast in this article.   As usual, thanks for your time and please do comment.  PS - Article written just for the sake of writing and this pro-corruption stand is just to break the monotony of the anti-corruption propaganda.

         Back to blogging after a very brief break. The topic I have chosen this time is about selfishness or selflessness. Like most of my blogs this one too had its origin in a conversation with my father. As usual I am writing to get all your opinions on this.    We say that any deed performed for self gain is called selfishness and any deed performed for the good of others is a selfless deed. But is there really something called selflessness.     The reason this question arises should be evident but I will explain my view point on this. When I perform charity it is to gain good will, name, or expecting a return favour when we need or at the least to accumulate   Punya   on my journey to meet God on the  D-Day . It is the same case when we help somebody. So everything boils down to selfishness. The only reason we can give for calling these deeds selflessness is by emphasizing the point that others gain more than I do.    So is there any point in calling any deed selflessness? I do not know.    No offence to any one intended but just a thought that struck my mind. I wrote this weblog only for the sake of writing.    As usual I thank you for all your patience and as usual feel free to comment.

      From the past few weeks there is a new serial being broadcast on Sun TV. You might ask me as why am I watching soap serials when I condemn them. But this one is not a soap opera. It is a kind of serial which tries to highlight the heritage of Tamil Nadu. In this serial the ancient art of astrology using finger prints " Naadi Josiyam ' features as the protagonist. 'What is " Naadi Josiyam "?' is the next question. Well, it is said that powerful saints of the ancient world wrote about all the people who were born centuries after them and who are yet to be born. Well, not about everyone but about every person who will have his/her fortune read using the " olai " (dried palm leaves). Everything about the person is told such as his/her name, parents name, his occupation, his past, present and future and is supposed to be the most accurate. It is very astonishing as to how will someone in the past know about every person and his personal details and so very accurate. The worst part is that this art is known in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other parts of South India. It would be very interesting if those who have had their fortunes read by these astrologers share their experiences and also tell us more on this topic. I have no more information on this as I myself haven't experienced this. On getting more information I will definitely share them. Once again I thank for your patience and please feel free to comment.
