       The following was adopted last Spring by the College as an "identity statement." Thanks to  urlLink Professor Scott Carlin  for posting this.  Southampton College, Long Island University's small liberal arts and sciences college, is dedicated to creating an environmentally sustainable and humane world through critical thinking, creativity, and global citizenship. The curriculum emphasizes academic excellence, inter-disciplinary, and experience-based learning, and takes full advantage of Long Island's marine, environmental, literary, and artistic wealth. Our mission is to empower students to care for the world.    June 26th  - In response to this mission statement,  Jennifer Rogers, environmental studies major, Southampton Class of 2000 , wrote: ( changes in blue )  It should be tweaked a bit if it is a cooperative model we're trying to implement, no?   Southampton College,   (a unique post-secondary education center and eco-village located on Long Island's East End, is dedicated to creating an environmentally sustainable and human world through critical thinking {thank you environmental thought class ;) }, creativity, and global citizenship.) Chances are SC will no longer be affiliated with LIU?    The curriculum emphasizes academic excellence,  community partnership,  experience-based learning, and takes full advantage of Long Island's  environmental, marine,  literary, and artistic wealth. Our mission is to empower students to care for the world.

        excerpt of an  urlLink Independent  article by Carey London  urlLink LIU To Close Southampton Campus; Students Rally Together     Student Activism   Many students are not going out without a fight -- a "positive" one, that is. On Friday afternoon, about 20 students gathered in the Avram Theatre for the first time to share ideas on how to raise money to save their school. Student organizers Joseph Brondo and Carly Kenkel stood before their peers and tried to rally the troops.  "It's us who have the emotional ties to the education of our future," said Kenkel, who emphasized that they must run a positive campaign to show that the students are not resentful, but rather passionate about continuing their education at Southampton. The focus must be on the "reason we need to save this college, not why it's falling apart," she said.   Organized only the night before the rally, the group has just begun to seek financial assistance from a variety of corporations. "We're trying to find money wherever we can," said Brondo. Two companies they have recently tapped for funds are McDonald's and Upromise, an organization that encourages businesses to donate a portion of their funds to their customers' Upromise college accounts. If possible, the students will embark on a nation-wide campaign and even seek out television personalities.  "We're going to write to Oprah," said Kenkel, among chuckles, "anything to show that we care."   Recommendations within the group were few and far between, but some suggested a "grassroots" style campaign, whereby students compose a general letter, or petition, and mail it out to parents, teachers, and community members to sign and return to LIU officials. However, Kenkel said, they have no access to home addresses and can only use email at the moment.   Brondo, a communications major with a focus on theory and film, said that one reason he is so dedicated to saving the Southampton campus is that he "fell in love with this school in the past five months I've been here." And the response this group has received from faculty, administration, and alumni has been overwhelmingly positive, he reported.   "We've been getting so many calls" from alumni students who want to help save the college, said Kenkel, who majors in marine biology and just finished her freshman year at Southampton. "Don't give up hope." But by this same token, she also advised students to prepare for the school's closing. "Figure out what you're going to do if this doesn't work," she said. "I'm definitely applying to other colleges, but I'm putting my heart into this."   The students' next meeting will be Tuesday at Avram Theatre, at 7 p.m.

        urlLink Newsday article:A fond farewell to Southampton College  Written by SANDY McINTOSH Sandy McIntosh, a 1970 graduate of Southampton College and a former adjunct faculty member, is a poet whose latest book is "Between Earth and Sky." He is the managing editor of Marsh Hawk Press.  June 24, 2004   The founding of Southampton College by Long Island University in 1963 encouraged many expectations. Local businesses hoped for an influx of money and jobs to help in the slack winter months. Cultural promoters looked forward to a new audience of intellectually curious students and faculty. And Long Island University itself anticipated...what?  Begun in 1886 as the Brooklyn College of Pharmacy, LIU had always promoted a service-oriented curriculum. What it planned for Southampton was a college meeting the needs of local families. What it got, however, was something else.  Almost by accident, during the 1960s, Southampton began to look and act like a northern version of Black Mountain, the experimental North Carolina college that for a short time had been a hub of American cultural production, mainly because of famous artists and writers who taught there. Black Mountain was long gone by 1963, but the willingness of accomplished artists and writers in the Hamptons, happy to be asked to teach, gave its memory new life. (In fact, several artists and writers from the community had taught at Black Mountain.)  It wasn't entirely the case that the college sought out these prominent artists. In the early years, departments continually scrambled for instructors, and were glad to hire anyone competent. So, the Abstract Expressionist painter Willem De Kooning was often seen in the halls of the Fine Arts building. The representational painter Fairfield Porter taught an undergraduate painting class, and the Neo-Plasticist painter and filmmaker Ilya Bolotowsky, with his thick Russian accent, could be found wrestling freshman English students through James Joyce.  Prominent writers, too, led classes. David Ignatow, winner of the Bollingen Prize and of a National Institute of Arts and Letters award for a lifetime of creative effort, patiently endured my fumbling first attempts at writing a poem.  Why did these artists happily submit to the chaos of a college in its formative years? Perhaps they were lonely.  In the '60s, the Hamptons' tourist season ended abruptly at Labor Day, the streets were deserted, and you might find a coffee shop open on Main Street, but not after 8 p.m. If you were marooned at the college in fall or winter, you could walk the empty streets in near-darkness to the ocean, where the crashing of waves was truly primitive and frightening. It was beneficial to meet colleagues in the halls of a college, rather than always on the stools of a bar.  There was much chaos in the early years, and not only the creative kind. There were constant rumors of faculty or staff misadventures, or about money that had gone missing, such as the gift of a wealthy local resident for the installation of ornate entrance gates. Nevertheless, the college did mature, if not in the image of the other LIU campuses, then in its local strengths.  The announcement that Southampton College will transfer its undergraduate programs to the C.W. Post Campus next year-effectively closing its doors-saddens those of us who share its history. But according to David Steinberg, LIU president, the college has accumulated several million dollars of debt. In the past this debt would have been addressable, but the other branches of the university have their own negative balances-notably C.W. Post, due to last year's faculty strike-and Southampton's is the last straw.  So, sometime in the near future, the university will consider selling the valuable campus real estate to a developer, who'll no doubt build a new Levittown of identical mansions for multi-millionaires.  The last students will have a lonely time, if a short one. Without the noise and lights of a bustling campus they'll walk the empty paths, where the crashing of waves from the nearby ocean will once again be heard, primitive and frightening.

        "With the terrific infrastructure that has been created for natural and marine science programs at Southampton, it would be wasteful to relocate those divisions to CW Post, which lacks waterfront access or adequate laboratory space for such a proposal. My question is what changes would be proposed to ensure that the marine and environmental programs benefit from an inland educational facility, and what would the University propose to do with the existing lab and marine space at Southampton?"  - Shawn Kiernan, Southampton College Class of 1999     Dear President Steinberg,   As a 1991 graduate of LIU Southampton I was shocked and disappointed to hear of the university’s decision to relocate the undergraduate programs from Southampton to CW Post. Like other alumni, Southampton College means a great deal to me. Not only did I receive a top-notch education, complimented by co-ops and internships, I also met and married my wife, Kathy (also a 1991 graduate) on campus.  While I cannot deny an obvious emotional attachment to the Southampton Campus, my dismay at the university’s decision emanates equally from the lack of detailed information coming from the administration.     Here are just a few of my questions:  1. Didn’t the University just spend about $60,000,000 on renovations to the campus? Why make such a large expenditure if the plan was to significantly cull the campus population?   2. How will funds generated from a smaller number of graduate students make up for funds generated from a larger number of undergraduate students? Research grants? Significantly higher graduate tuitions?      3. Does LIU have enough graduate programs to justify keeping the Southampton College open?   4. Will graduate programs from CW Post and other campuses be transferred to Southampton?   5. Is this a precursor to the university selling the land on which the Southampton Campus is based?   6. What about WPBX? I understand that the radio station will still broadcast from the campus. How will this be accomplished when many of the staff members are undergraduate students?   7. How does the university intend on continuing the Marine Science program?    8. How will the university make up the funds for lost alumni support? After all, what is our motivation to donate money to an institution that has eliminated our attachment to it?    9. Why didn’t we hear about the campuses financial difficulties earlier? Was the money mismanaged? Were there some creative accounting practices in place?   10. How will the university stem the tide of departing students? Undergraduate Southampton students clearly made a decision to attend a small semi-rural campus. In all probability many of them will transfer to other schools. Conversely, what about students at other LIU Campuses? They clearly made a decision to attend suburban campuses. If forced to travel to Southampton, they may leave in droves as well.   I, and the rest of the Southampton Campus Alumni, eagerly await your answers to these and similar questions.    - Scott Watson, BAHistory/Political Science, Southampton College Class of 1991     Email your letters, stories, photos, questions - anything and everything to me!   scogar@alumni.liu.edu   Pass this blog address onto all your alumni friends!   http://savesouthamptoncollege.blogspot.com

       -----Original Message----- From: Louis Antoniello [mailto:lantoniello@licb.com] Sent: Friday, June 25, 2004 8:52 AM Subject: RE: JUNE 24th Meeting @ SC  Hello All:  Joan is correct, the best thing we can do prior to the July 7th meeting is to write, write, write.Send your e-mails/letters to David Steinberg, the press, etc.  I have been contacted by  "CBS Investigative Reporting" ,  they believe that there may be a story as far as the management of funds at LIU over the years . I have provided them my opinion and invited them to the meeting on 7/7 at 7, if you know anyone in the local newspapers bring them along. This is our opportunity to let the administration at the University know that we do not appreciate they way they have treated SHC for the past 30 years and we believe that they have made the wrong choice and should have never made the public statement pertaining to SHC and its undergrad classes.  I myself will have some very direct questions that I will ask asked, they need to be answered and they will be. I believe that after the Q & A the press will realize that LIU was the reason for financial problems not SHC.  I Look forward to seeing you on 7/7 at 7.  Enjoy your day.  LA

       -----Original Message----- From: JoanTuttSeashell@aol.com Sent: Friday, June 25, 2004 2:50 AM Subject: JUNE 24th Meeting @ SC  Dear Alumni Friends:  The meeting today lasted over 2 hours. I am emotionally spent. It was obvious to me, that the faculty was unaware about the changes that were about to take place.  Many people spoke and there was an exchange of ideas. The meeting was respectful and never became a shouting match.  Amongst the faculty present that you may recall were Dr. Don Baker and Bob Gerbereaux from the library.  Genie Kornhaber, '68, and I were the oldest in attendance; not by age, but by years from the beginning of SC. We both expressed the undying and unwavering love and support we are receiving from the alumni of '67,'68, '69 & '70. Those in attendance: faculty, students & staff, were very appreciative and maybe a little surprised at our fervor and commitment. I signed a list to be considered for a future committee.  There were no administration present, so this was not a Q & A session. On the contrary, it was a forum to discuss concerns and methods of making our voices heard and listened to. Suggested on several occasions was  a letter writing campaign . Many of you have written me from CA & FL & points in between wanting to help, but not knowing what to do from afar. WRITE!!!!    Write to your local papers.....write letters to the editors......write poems....write anything you choose, but just write! Those in NY & LI.....get your letters into Newsday & The NY Times, as well as your local papers. Some alums are involved with the media....go to it!!! Do your thing!!!    When you do, make a copy of your letter and where and when it was published (i.e. July 5, 2004, The Miami Herald by Jane or John Doe) and send it to Dr. Steinberg and the Board of Trustees. And if you want, send one to me and I'll keep a file of all of them for committee use. "The power of the pen is mightier than the sword!"   Below is a letter from Don Getz, '68, Marine Science Station Staff. After the meeting was over reporters interviewed and took pictures. Newsday said there was to be two articles; one Friday and one this weekend. I'll be forwarding to you a Newsday piece by Mr. Sandy McIntoch, '70.  I am too pooped to go into any more details at this time.  Mark your calendars for an ALUMNI meeting with Dr. Steinberg, on Wednesday, July 7 @ 7PM @ Chancellor's Hall. Remember: 7/7 @ 7 !   I also have a call into The Southampton Chamber of Commerce, of which I am a member. Wondering where they see themselves in all of this controversy. Needless to say, the local community has benefited substantially from SC's presence!  Hope to see you 7/7 @ 7! Maybe afterward we can all go out to  Barristers ,  The Publick House , or  Armand's .  ~Joan DiPaola Tutt, '68, '74   In a message dated 6/24/2004 8:09:37 PM Eastern Daylight Time, getzaway@optonline.net writes:  Hi Joan Today a meeting was held at the Avram theater chaired by Scott Carlin. The meeting was open to the entire college community as a forum to prevent the relocation of our college. Press members were asked to leave in that this was a private meeting. Ideas were exchanged and I believe a committee will be formed in an effort to affix blame for Southampton's financial problems and the university as a whole. Ideas express would involve the college and the surrounding community.  Don

       I may or may not be able to attend  urlLink the meeting  on July 7th with Dr. Steinberg and Dr. Rodas, but I have thought of some questions to ask:  What will happen to the faculty at Southampton who will not be able to commute to C. W. Post on a daily basis to teach classes?   Will there be jobs at C. W. Post or other campuses for the staff? (administrative professionals, food service, public safety officers, physical plant, etc.)  What will happen to the staff at Southampton who are close to retirement? Will the University honor pensions and/or retirement plans? Or will the staff be forced to commute? Or will there not be any work for them at the other campuses?  What will be done with all the money raised at this year's  urlLink All For The Sea concert ? What happened to the donation I sent to the college earlier this year?  How can you justify closing a school whose marine and environmental sciences programs have produced  34 Fulbright Scholars in the past 28 years ?   If the school is closing for financial reasons that have been lingering for years, what was done to try and stop it? What failed? What was not tried? Whose fault is it that the college was so poorly managed at the financial level for so many years?  How long will the college stay open with only graduate courses available on campus?  urlLink To quote ,  "The University has determined that the expenses of rebuilding Southampton College are cost-prohibitive and not financially sustainable."  If you can't keep the college open and making ends meet with undergraduate tuition, how do you plan on staying open with limited monies from a small number of graduate students' tuitions?  What will happen to the campus? Will it be sold to the highest bidder? Will it be donated to some East End charity so the University gets a big tax break? Will it be turned into a hotel/resort for events like the U.S. Open and Parish Art Museum gatherings?  (sorry - my cynicism and knowledge of East End motivations got the best of me on this one)    What questions would you like to ask President Steinberg and Provost Rodas?    If you cannot attend the meeting, please email your questions and comments to Carol.gilbert@liu.edu or call the Alumni Office at 632-287-8348. Send a copy to me, too, and I'll post them here.

       Hello! Sorry for the introductions to be a bit late.  My name is Samantha Cogar, an alumni of Southampton College, and I served as President for the Class of 2000.  Like many of you, I was shocked and saddened to hear of the decision to relocate undergraduate courses from Southampton College to the C. W. Post campus due to financial reasons. Like many of you, I wondered if there was anything I could do to stop it from actually happening. I do not live close to the college (currently I'm in the Washington, DC metropolitan area), so starting this blog is my attempt to unite alumni, staff, administration and current/future students. There are some links on the side bar and I've tried to post any information sent to me from the college (usually via email).  But to make this blog truly useful, I need to hear from you.     Send me an email (scogar@alumni.liu.edu) with any questions, comments, stories, information, links, photos, etc. Please include your name, email address, and role at Southampton (class/years attended and/or job title) and put Save Southampton College in the subject line (so I don't think it's spam and delete it).    Some questions you may want to address:  How do you feel about the relocation of classes? Do you have any ideas of how to stop the relocation? What made Southampton College such a great place to go to school? What are your fondest memories of Southampton College?

       The meeting with President Steinberg and Provost Rodas will take place as described below. If there are alumni interested in car-pooling to this event, email me ( scogar@alumni.liu.edu ) with the following info:   1. your name  2. email address 3. where you live 4. day to depart to Southampton 5. day to depart back home   I'll post a list of those interested in car pooling to the meeting here on the blog so people can network to get there.  For cheap, last minute flights, I would suggest  urlLink Southwest Airlines  that flies to Islip.  urlLink JetBlue  flies to JFK and  urlLink Spirit Airlines  flies to LaGuardia.  Anyone interested in flying to NYC or Islip and car pooling from those airports and anyone interested in picking up people at those airports should also email me.  Duke Lecture Hall isn't that big - Let's make it STANDING ROOM ONLY and show our support for Southampton College!

        To: The University Community  From: David Steinberg, President  Date: June 16, 2004  Subject:  urlLink Relocation of Southampton College Undergraduate Programs   Yesterday the University’s Board of Trustees instructed the University Officers to relocate the undergraduate liberal arts and sciences programs currently offered at Southampton College onto the C.W. Post Campus, effective September 2005. The University will continue to offer its outstanding graduate programs at Southampton. It is with a heavy heart that I write to inform you of this painful but necessary decision, one in which the University Officers unanimously concur. In response to the Board’s unequivocal instructions, the administration now must move thoughtfully to bring this decision to fruition.   In the fiscal year ending August 2004, the Southampton campus is anticipated to lose $9 million. The anticipated deficit for the 2004/05 fiscal year is projected at greater than $12 million. The cumulative deficit since inception at Southampton will have reached an unacceptable $77 million by September, 2005. Despite the extraordinary efforts of a great many people on that campus and the embrace of generous alumni, overseers, trustees and supportive citizens on the East End, hard fiscal realities make a continuation of high quality but very expensive undergraduate instruction at Southampton beyond the reach of this University.   For more than four decades, Long Island University has sought to sustain three discrete residential campuses, each functioning in its own environment and developing its own character. The effort to create at Southampton an academically excellent, financially self-sufficient, world-class, small college has been a labor of love for countless individuals over many years. Ultimately, however, the University’s primary obligation always must be to its current students -- both those who study at Southampton College and, equally, those who study elsewhere in the University.   Several years ago, after an exhaustive review and analysis, a special committee of the Board concluded that maintaining the status quo at Southampton was no longer a viable choice. The Board instructed the administration to draft a Master Plan, to redesign a dynamic core curriculum, to begin a capital construction effort and to launch a fundraising campaign. What could not be measured then was the timing and size of future enrollment increases as the result of new curricula and facilities. Despite a modest upturn in potential freshmen for the upcoming year, the required enrollment growth necessary to reduce significantly Southampton’s operating deficits is not foreseeable. Consequently, the loss of tuition dollars has created deficits beyond the University’s ability to stay the marathon course. The Southampton deficit must not jeopardize the health of the entire University.  The dynamic new core curriculum for freshmen as well as the existing courses required for returning students will be taught at the Southampton campus next year and at C.W. Post thereafter. The University is also in active discussions about how best to meet the needs of those students enrolled in marine science after next year. We intend to work with every student to help each one meet his or her educational goals. Every Southampton student will be given a careful explanation of his or her options, a chance to visit C.W. Post or Brooklyn, and an opportunity to receive professional help in any efforts to transfer to other colleges, if that is their choice.  Over the next days and weeks, the University will communicate with the many Southampton stakeholders through detailed memos, personal meetings and individual sessions. Faculty, staff and administrators will receive an explanation of the implications of this decision. At every appropriate juncture, timely information and a comprehensive array of services will be provided for Southampton students and staff to help them through this transition.  The University’s fundamental commitment to provide each student a superior education and to treat every student, teacher and employee with genuine care, concern and respect will not waiver. This Board decision will affect individual human lives, each with a unique set of circumstances, cares and concerns. Many at Southampton College have labored long and hard in pursuit of a dream that, sadly, now will not happen there. Although it pains me and my colleagues deeply, the Board’s decision sets the parameters of what the University must do now to achieve its potential in the decades to come. In that spirit, I charge all of us to transform this disappointment into a renewed commitment to Long Island University.

        Thanks to   Catherine Baker   for sending the entire text of the article.    By Donald G. Baker  Issue Date: Southampton Press 07/01/04  The Southampton community—indeed, the entire East End of Long Island—has a legitimate right to be outraged by the Long Island University administration’s abrupt and unilateral decision to close its Southampton College undergraduate program.  For years LIU leaders acknowledged but took few actions to correct the college’s economic problems (yearly losses of approximately $2 million have continued for 16 or more years, but only in the last few years has the LIU administration addressed the issue), but they did not discuss in advance with the community or the college community (faculty, staff, students, or even the alumni advisory board of the college) that the school would be closed. Indeed, the LIU administration’s announcements over the past year that it was engaged in a $60 million renovation and its proud announcement that Chancellor Robert F.X. Sillerman was donating millions for the new library (now being built) raises serious questions about how candid that administration has been with the college’s constituent groups and the Southampton (and larger East End) community.  Only last week did the university announce that it was closing Southampton College (it claims it is only “moving” the college to its C.W. Post campus), yet in numerous recent newspaper stories it appears that even prior to that public closing announcement the administration has been involved in “intensive” discussions with the State University of New York at Stony Brook about moving the college’s marine science program there. This information was never shared with the college community.  Moreover, the administration now admits that it is already exploring possibilities for selling off the college property—without first considering and discussing with all involved and affected college and community groups the broader environmental and economic implications and impact on these parties and the East End itself.  This raises a series of legal and related issues that perhaps need to be examined:  1. Does Long Island University have the legal right to sell the Southampton College property? LIU did not buy the property—the property was bought by an East End citizens group, desirous of establishing an undergraduate college. It explored that possibility with LIU, which said it would establish an undergraduate college only if the local community purchased the property. The committee purchased the property and granted title to LIU specifically for and contingent upon the establishment and continuation of an undergraduate college on the purchased property. Otherwise the group would have looked for alternative ways of establishing an undergraduate college.  For whatever reasons, LIU has now decided it can no longer operate an undergraduate college on that property. Hence the question: Does this action abrogate LIU’s right to that property? The East End group’s decisions and motivations are clearly indicated in newspaper accounts from 1962 and 1963 (and acknowledged in various publications, including a LIU booklet celebrating the university’s 75th anniversary) that clearly state the property was, after being bought by the local committee, donated to LIU solely for the purpose of establishing and maintaining an undergraduate college.  Thus a specific question and possible legal issue can be raised: Has LIU, by its decision to terminate the undergraduate college on this property, forfeited its claim to the property, whatever the title to that property may state? The community’s intent for offering LIU the property solely for the purpose of establishing and maintaining an undergraduate college is clear.  Is there, therefore, a legal basis for questioning LIU’s retention of the property, at least of the property itself and the original buildings on that property? Does the community, at a minimum, have a vested right to the property itself and the original buildings?  That local community committee, it should be noted, raised $325,000 to purchase the property, and then raised another $50,000 for needed repairs. Only after this, as newspaper reports indicate, was the property turned over to LIU, which agreed to establish and maintain an undergraduate college.  LIU, it can be argued, is now reneging on that agreement, and the basic legal question is that by doing so, has LIU forfeited its right to the original property and buildings, its rightful claim only for the other buildings erected on the property? Is there a legal basis for the town/community reclaiming the property, since LIU has stated it will no longer live up to that agreement to maintain an undergraduate college on the property?  2. There is a possible second legal issue. Chancellor Robert F.X. Sillerman generously, even after numerous earlier large gifts that kept the college afloat, subsequently contributed millions of dollars for building a new library, his donation based on the administration’s public statements that it would invest possibly $60 million for the college’s renaissance—only to abruptly decide to close the college. Given the circumstances, and the board of trustees’ statements about the purported large infusion of funds, was the chancellor himself misled in his decision to provide grants for the new library—and does he have legal recourse to be reimbursed by the university?  3. The designated college closing raises yet another issue. The New York State Board of Regents is involved in the establishment and evaluation of academic institutions in the state. This is evident in the earlier case of Adelphi University where the Regents investigated the mismanagement of Adelphi’s president and the university’s board of trustees’ questionable or non-fulfillment of its fiduciary responsibilities in overseeing the economic and managerial practices of the institution’s president. The Regents removed both, acknowledging its oversight responsibilities in scrutinizing how institutions of higher education are operated and managed.  Thus, in such cases as the closing of colleges, or the economic hemorrhaging of $2 million yearly at Southampton College for 16-plus years, surely that Board of Regents has a responsibility to probe the management of Long Island University and the oversight responsibilities of the LIU Board of Trustees, particularly since Southampton’s ongoing economic problems appear to extend beyond the confines of Southampton College to the larger university itself.  4. A final legal issue: The LIU administration appears to be hastily seeking to sell off the Southampton College property, but does it or the community own the property? We require for all (usually new) major property developments an Environmental Impact Statement, hence a basic question here is: before the property is sold, shouldn’t the proper authorities require an environmental (including an economic) impact statement that addresses the question(s) of the economic and environmental impact on eastern Long Island in general and more specifically of the college’s termination of employment for one of the largest groups of employees in eastern Long Island?  Donald G. Baker has been at Southampton College since 1964, when he became professor of political science and history and founding director of the Social Science Division.

       Found this Newsday article online (from June 9th, 2004):  urlLink University agrees to $112G fine in waste case   Long Island University has agreed to pay about $112,000 in fines for violating waste management regulations by failing to properly store and keep records of hazardous materials at its C.W. Post and Southampton College campuses in a settlement reached last week with the Environmental Protection Agency.  The university also must establish 10 environmental management seminars for high school officials in New York and New Jersey about how to comply with regulations governing toxic substances.  Terry Ippolito, spokeswoman for the EPA's Region 2 office in Manhattan, said the seminar requirement, which will cost at least $115,000, stems from the agency's belief "that some of the safety concerns that we have at colleges and universities could very well be evident if one were to do an inspection of high schools ..." ... She said the EPA inspections dated back to November 2001 at Southampton, and a short time later at C.W. Post and at LIU's Brooklyn campus - where the university reached an earlier settlement with the EPA. The violations that were found included not having correct storage containers and not keeping a record of how much waste was accumulating. The hazardous materials involved, Ippolito said, included solvents used in science labs, vehicle service garages and carpentry and paint shops.  The EPA fined LIU  $39,057  for the chemical waste violations and another  $73,244  penalty for underground petroleum storage tank violations at C.W. Post.  Could there be more environmental problems on the campus that the administration does not want the EPA or anyone else to find out about? Could this fine by the EPA just be the start and the University is worried they will have to spend more and more money to fix problems on campus and to do community outreach programs? Anyone remember having to endure the stench of the septic tanks being pumped in the Montauks and Peconics? What else is out of date and under code at the college? Perhaps these code violations from the EPA is just the tip of the iceberg... Could the fines for admitting there is problems and the cost of repairing them be too much for the university to handle? Are they worried it would further tarnish their reputation? Perhaps selling the land to the highest bidder, making a profit, and washing their hands of anything dirty is the answer...   urlLink Officials mull sale of part of campus    urlLink Levy eyes campus buy   Lots of articles in this week's  urlLink Southampton Press  (you'll need an online subscription to read them)  What is the real motivation behind this sale? Why now? Why such a drastic decision when all other actions by the University were starting to point towards helping Southampton? There's something awry...something doesn't fit and something doesn't make sense....  What do you think? (email a post to me: scogar@alumni.liu.edu)

         Dear Blogspot Members,  I had sent a letter to Assemblyman Thiele in reference to the "relocation" of our college and would like to share his response with you.  Nora Detweiler      Dear Ms. Detweiler,   Thank you for your recent letter regarding the decision of Long Island University to close the undergraduate programs at Southampton College.   As an alumni and elected official who has maintained a close relation with the College through the years, I was shocked to learn of LIU's plans for Southampton College. This decision was apparently made in a vacuum without consultation with the many stakeholders who have an interest in the future of Southampton College. I regret that I learned of the decision not from officials at LIU or Southampton College, but from a newspaper reporter.   Of course, my initial reaction was simply anger. Anger because my alma mater was to be closed, but also because of the unprofessional way in which this decision was made. If this decision and the way it was made are any reflection of the way the College has been managed, it is no wonder that the College's financial problems continue to worsen.   We were all aware that Southampton College has not been a moneymaker for LIU. Yet, we had hope for the future.  The College had announced a major capital campaign. A new library was under contruction, an agreement had been reached with the Parrish Art Museum for their new facility. A new curriculum was being implemented. In short, there was a vision for the future. The decision of LIU is a betrayal of that vision.   While we are all justifiably angered by the decision of LIU, we cannot dwell on that anger. Rather, we must join together to find a constructive solution to the crisis with which we are now confronted. We have a little over a year before the College closes. We have no time to waste.   I pledge to do all that I can to insure that the Southampton College campus remains devoted to the purposes of higher education.  The College has been so much more to our area than merely an educational institution. Obviously, as one of the region's larger employers it is a critical part of the local economy. It has also been a resource for policy makers grappling with critical regional issues like the environment and transportation. Most important it has brought life-changing opportunity to many local residents who otherwise would not have been able to take a class or earn a degree. The College has brought a multiple of tangible and intangible benefits to the people on the East End.   Further, I pledge to fight just as hard to insure that the campus is not sold off as surplus land to be converted to some speculative development scheme. The East End needs a college, not another commercial or condominium project.   I have spoken with many of my fellow elected officials including State Senator Ken LaValle,Congressman Tim Bishop, County Legislator Jay Schneiderman, and Southampton Town Supervisor Patrick Heaney.  We are all committed to keeping higher education at the Southampton College campus.   We are now at the very beginning of exploring the available options to maintaining a college at Southampton. It will take vision and creativity to construct the right solution, but it can be done. We will be exploring the participation of the State University of New York at Southampton, as well as the possible involvement of Suffolk County Community College. There may be other educational institutions who would also be interested in the joint future use of the campus. While much work needs to be done, I am encouraged by the initial reaction of officials and the public to these possibilities.   Please be assured, that I will insist that the public and all stakeholders be very much involved in decisions relating to the future of Southampton College. It is imperative that this is a public process and that all with an interest in the College are heard.   I look forward to working with you to insure that the Southampton College campus is not closed, but is transformed into an institution that will serve our region even better in the future."   Sincerely yours, Fred Thiele, Jr. Member of the Assembly    Assemblyman Thiele also attached a copy of the letter he has sent to David Steinberg which is posted below.    Dear President Steinberg,   I write in response to your June 16, 2004 "Memorandum" to the University Community announcing the closing of the undergraduate program at Southampton College.   Let me first state my deepest disappointment at this decision, suddenly made by you and the LIU Trustees, without warning to the public or Southampton College stakeholders. While I was certainly aware of the financial challenges confronting the College, I do not believe that you or the Trustees had given the public any indication that the closing of the College was under active consideration.   Quite to the contrary, the Trustees had presented a face of hope to the public about the future of Southampton College. A new library was under construction. A new capital program was being pursued. An agreement had been announced with the Parrish Art Museum for the location of its new facility at the College. A new core curriculum was being implemented. We were all left with the impression that LIU was committed to a new and better Southampton College.   The LIU Trustees have betrayed that commitment. They are now Trustees who are not worthy of our trust.   As devastating as the decision itself was to those who have a stake in Southampton College, even more troubling was the process by which this decision was announced. There was no indication that such a decision was being considered. There was no consultation with persons like myself who are alumni and elected officials. In short, it had all the elements of "Pearl Harbor". I was very disppointed to learn of your decision not from a representative of the University or College, but from a local newspaper reporter. If the decision to close Southampton College is any indication of how the College was managed on a day to day basis, it is no wonder the College is in trouble.   In the aftermath of this decision, there have been equally troubling comments in the media about the future of the campus from LIU officials. The focus seems to be on appraisals, property values and selling the campus to the highest bidder.   Let me state to you in the most unequivocal words I can muster. I will use all my authority and effort as a public official to insure that the campus of Southampton College is used in the future for the purposes of higher education. If that is not under the auspices of LIU, then with some other institution such as SUNY to insure that the residents of the East End have access to a four-year college.   Similarly, I will use all of the power of my office to insure that Southampton College campus is not auctioned off to the highest bidder from some speculative real estate project. The East End needs a College, not another condominium project or commercial shopping area.   This reflects the position of every elected official I have spoken with about Southampton College. I hope that LIU will pledge to work with the East End community to to insure that the campus remains devoted to higher education.   Sincerely yours, Fred Thiele, Jr. Member of Assembly    Contact Information (send him a thank you!):   Assemblymember Fred W. Thiele Jr.  2302 Main Street, Box 3062 Bridgehampton, NY 11932 Phone: (631) 537-2583 Email:  thielef@assembly.state.ny.us     And a BIG THANKS TO NORA! Thank you for sending the letter to Assemblymember Thiele and for forwarding his response for everyone to read!

        Here's to alumnus   Genie Kornhaber Weisman  , who's letter to Newsday shows she has Southampton Spirit!  Bravo, Genie!    From Newsday's  urlLink Letters to the Editor (Long Island Edition)  June 29, 2004   DEGREES OF SEPARATION  A community hopes to save its college from obsolescence  As a graduate of Southampton College, reading "A fond farewell to Southampton College" [Opinion,  urlLink June 24 ] sent a chill down my spine. Having returned from a forum of stunned, concerned, but nonetheless determined and enthusiastic teachers, students and alumni, I felt compelled to respond. I believe the fond farewell is premature. We gathered to try to get a grip on the situation. Unfortunately, there were plenty of questions, but no answers. Most of us were incredulous, still shell-shocked.  The timing of the closing announcement is suspect. When, how and by whom were these decisions made? There are lots of smart lawyers, bankers, business people, scientists, teachers, artists and other professionals out there who have Southampton College to thank, not only for fond memories, but in some part, for who they are and where they are in their lives today. We need as many of them as possible to ask the appropriate questions, mull over the answers, then try to come up with some alternatives to just closing down this wonderful institution. It makes me sick to think the property will be sold off for more mansions. Time is of the essence. We certainly can't let this happen without a fight.  Members of the Southampton community, friends of the college, as well as alumni, need to support the students, faculty and staff. We need to get involved now. With everyone putting their heads together, we just might be able to turn things around. It's worth a try. We need support and positive thinking, not eulogies. It ain't over yet!

       A few days ago, I received an email from a former professor of the college. The subject line was  "give it up" . The contents of the email are below:  No campaign is going to change a damned thing. This has been on the cards for over a decade and most of the questions being posed are naive in the extreme. I predicted this outcome, in writing, about 6 years ago and was just about 3 months off with regard to the actual announcement date. Faculty are tenured at LIU, not Southampton College and the University is under no obligation to offer them anything more than a job at another campus. Untenured faculty are simply going to have to look for other employment. That's how academia works. The College has been running at a multi-million $$ deficit since it opened and, while other schools were growing and improving all their programs, Southampton was resting on its laurels telling everybody they were great and believing their own publicity. This is a business decision and there are many other choices out there for students that are a better expenditure of the same amount of money. I too was president of my class and president of the alumni association for over a decade. I cannot believe this was an easy decision for anyone, but it has been made and the best thing to do now is move on. It's not going to be reversed and a lot of energy is going to be expended for nothing. Steinberg and the Board of Trustees will listen politely, answer questons  (sic)  with rhetoric and then go about their business. Why waste the time? Nothing anybody can say or do is going to change the picture. Southampton was never a real priority within the LIU system and it surely isn't now. I could write a series of books on the subject, I"ve got a 34 year history with the place. The best thing people can do is work on a deal for the juniors because they will be hit the hardest. Seniors can graduate, freshmen and sophomores can transfer. Juniors can only transfer a certain number of credits outside LIU and many may not want to go to Post (or Brooklyn). I hope when all this blows over, you can look back and remember the good times you had, the friends you made and keep sight of the fact that your degree is from LIU, not Southampton College. Best of luck in your future endeavors, XXXXXXXXXXXX -------------  Is this email an indication of how this professor mentors and instructs their current students? Give up in the face of opposition? Do not question authority? Do not question the policies given to you? Do not question the choices made for you? When faced with the odds against you, do not work hard to attain your dreams and goals? Just give in. You can't do it. You've lost. Don't even try.  Is there a need to post the name of this particular former professor of SC? I'm guessing that is exactly what they would want. Having dealt with this person during my undergraduate years, watching them manipulate students and faculty alike, their motivations for sending me an email are not shrouded in mystery. (And I'm guessing there are quite a few of you out there who can guess who wrote this email.)  With this particular former professor, it seems it is always a view of winning and losing. Life doesn't work that way. Just as there is not an absolute zero, there is no true winner nor a true loser. The winner has sacrificed something along the way to win and the loser is able to walk away from the situation having developed a skill or learned a lesson.   Is there really a chance that we can stop LIU from moving Southampton's undergraduate courses to another campus? I'm not sure. The odds are clearly against us. But I'm not one to fold my hands in the face of defeat. If I were that type of person, I never would have taken this particular professor on in the realm of campus politics. If I were that type of person, I would not have graduated from Southampton College. If more people at Southampton were that type of person, perhaps this former professor would still be teaching at Southampton. Instead, it is easier for this former professor to trash the college from a distance and toot their own proverbial horn about being right about EVERYTHING - yet their actions do not show this. If this former professor did know where the college was heading, why did they spend 34 years at a college that they saw was doomed to fail?   The question again:  Will we, as the collective group of alumni, students, staff and administration, be able to change the board's decision?  It's true that it's a long shot, but I'll be damned if I'm going to sit by the sidelines and not show support for the college that taught me so much - from lessons in the classroom to life lessons I'll never forget.  I'll be damned if I'm going to throw my hands up in the air and say there is nothing I can do.  I can show support for my alma mater. I can show support for the students who have attended and still attend. I can show support for the professors who have worked so diligently and honorably to help their students learn and achieve. I can show support to the campus staff who's dedication to Southampton College is deeper and stronger than staff at other colleges.    I will not give up in the face of opposition.   I will not give up on Southampton College.   Who's with me?

That is a fact, but what is ignored are the factors that --in my opinion--precipitated that lower enrollment over the years, namely: (1) a series of bad and often myopic decisions concerning programs, development, ignoring and undermining specific disciplines in order to enhance the one that had "national recognition" (i.e., the marine science program), cutting back on faculty in other areas which meant students leaving because of insufficient course offerings in those other disciplines (this is not a criticism of marine science per se, but of the ignoring of the other disciplines that, needing less equipment, laboratories, boats, etc., in reality brought in surplus funds to support the marine science program); (2) an organizational structure, established by the LIU administration that led over the decades to constant conflicts, disagreements or confusion over who was repsonsible for what in terms of the truncated leadership of a Provost and an Academic Dean, resulting ultimately in a turnover of more than six deans in ten years, that resulting in chaos within the organization; and (3) leadership and management, the leadership of the University for decades ignoring the college, resulting in the college having to rely almost solely on student tuition for paying virtually all of its costs and expenses, then, in the last couple of years, switching to micromanagement, where first one LIU vice president and then a subsequent one willy-nilly cut courses right and left, further curtailing course offerings and driving away students because of fewer course offerings,then imposing a "new core curriculum" that was largely agreed to by faculty only under the threat of being closed otherwise. The reality is the Board of Trustees rather than close the college should have fired the president and vice president; for 16 years or more the Trustees allowed the college to lose two million dollars or more each year (a corporation and its board of directors long before that period of time would have fired the top management for bad management). What is interesting is that the college continued along for decades losing roughly two million a year; once the university administration switched to micromanaging, that figure raced from four to five and then a projected twelve million loss each year. Low enrollment is certainly a factor in the demise of Southampton College, but to find the real reasons --at least in my opinion-- one needs to look at the above factors. What else could be expected for Southampton College given the above factors? The question is, if that management continues in place for the university, and long after Southampton is gone, can the rest of the university, in terms of its future, be far behind? Pray for it!    - Professor Donald G. Baker

        (Newsday did not print this letter from Alan, but he was kind enough to share it with all the Save Southampton College! readers.)   Southampton College has been the home to many students and faculty over the last 40 years. Sadly the Real Estate minded board of Trustees has decided that now is the time to close the college, sell the campus, and settle old scores and debts.  The trickle down effect will be gut wrenching for thousands of people.  The East End of Long Island will suffer the lose of it’s largest single employer, the baker, the gas station, the supermarket, the cleaners, the real estate agent and the East End’s economy in general will suffer greatly.  So will the displaced students who are enrolled in Southampton College. The faculty who has made homes and lives there for many years will be uprooted and the plethora of jobs that have supported so many will be gone.  The Local population will feel the sting more than they realize.  The college has become a part of the community in so many ways that most people forgot what it was like before it was here.  When a parent comes to visit his son or daughter at the college he often takes them to eat in town, he might buy a something at Hampton, stay overnight at a hotel or motel and have breakfast in town on main street.  Little gifts or souvenirs are not an uncommon item to purchase from any shop in town. This will end.  They will not come, they will not spend their money and any student who was enrolled for the fall, when the enrollment was up 13 %, will probably transfer out as fast as he or she can.  The Economy and the people here will take a big hit...  The town will be hurt by the loss of the intellectual energy coming from the various activities at the college.  The Writers conference, the Steinbeck Book Fair, The Art Shows, The Plays, the Concerts, the frenzy of the summer will die at the end of the summer and it will be very different.  There will be no fall or winter Buzz from the college and the town will revert to what it was 40 years ago when Southampton “closed up” after Labor Day.  I went to school at Southampton many years ago and I remember what it was like at the  End of the summer. Labor Day came and it became a very quiet place. This was a summer resort town, not a year round, not a vibrant, living, thriving community as it is today.   The Alumni are gathering for a fight, we do not want to see our history in the trash pile at LIU.  LIU has promised a college within a college.  Southampton college will cease to exist after it moves to the CW Post campus, maybe a it will last a year or so but no more, there will be  no reason for it to last longer .  They have promised to continue the scholarships for all athlete’s that transfer to Post...well great, good for Post what other cherry picking ideas do they have to enliven the CW Post campus... maybe they want to take the college Windmill with them, the Radio Station and the Unfinished library.  They can not take our memories, our feelings or our desire to keep the college here and alive for generations to experience the same influences that we experienced.  We were all exposed to a love of Art, Literature, intellectual freedom and the ability to dream.  To Dream, that what you want--- can happen.  To take a course on the Bible sitting on the beach and listening to a profound explanation of some verses in Micah will never happen at CW Post campus. ……  To See FX Sillerman up on the stage with Paul Simon or Jimmy Buffet or Mel Brooks and listen to him introduce his “Friends “and know that he really means it when he says “friends “... that’s the man who put his money were his mouth was, his millions and he helped keep the dream alive.  We, the alumni, the friends of the college and the community have to fight LIU’s decision now. Before it is too late.  Nothing will be the same again if we do not win this fight.   - Alan Michael Braveman

       The following Alumni meeting update was emailed to Sam by JoanTuttSeashell@aol.com:  THEY CAME FROM ALMOST EVERY TOWN IN SUFFOLK COUNTY: FROM HUNTINGTON TO EAST MARION. THEY CAME FROM NASSAU, BROOKLYN & QUEENS. THEY CAME FROM NYC. THEY CAME FROM WESTCHESTER.  THEY CAME FROM NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT, VERMONT, MAINE, AND COLORADO!  WHY?     TO SUPPORT SC!!    The Meeting ran smoothly, thanks to  Bob Martin, '68,  who orchestrated the format.   LIU President David Steinberg  gave a 41 year history of the financials of SC and a review of LIU, too.   That took about 45 minutes.    Mickey Director ,'68, spoke on governance and directed questions to the LIU panel that consisted of Legal Council, Current & former Financial Officers, Dean of Academic Affairs, Chief LIU Fundraiser, The President of LIU and SC Provost.    C.L.A.S.S. provided a court stenographer. When we have that piece ready, we'll alert you.    The media was there also: Channel 12 Newsday Dan's Papers  & More   Alum Matt LoGuercio  videotaped the entire proceedings.   Alum Alan Braverman  photographed the entire evening.   Bob Martin  then directed questions concerning finance.  LIU gave out printed info pertaining to the bottom line.  In between each of the three segments, questions were taken from the floor.   Peter Philip , '67 addressed the segment on Problem Solving.  In conclusion, Bob Martin  asked that the university to consider not making their announcement irrevocable, in order to allow the SC stakeholders, students, parents, alumni, faculty, staff, community, businesses, government and concerned citizens time to formulate options for the future of SC.  Dr. Steinberg said he will take our request to his board.

       I listened to the Fiscal History of LIU as presented by Dr. David Steinberg last night at Southampton College. Later I listened to the LIU numbers cruncher explain in painful detail that the red ink has flowed from Southampton College since its inception. Even latter we heard from the chief fund Raiser of LIU about how hard it is to raise money for Endowments from former students. We even heard how hard it is to get students to come to this campus. And how expensive it is...  But no one ever called and said “the college is in severe financial shape we need your help Now ….or we may have to close…. how much can you contribute?”  And no one ever called and said “we do not have the money to repair the dorms, they need to be painted, in fact the entire campus needs a paint job will you as alum come and help... donate money, or paint, and time and energy?  And no one ever called and said “we are having trouble recruiting students  ...do you know anyone that would like to come to college here?  No one, not once in all these years.  You have my assurances…. we all would have said yes, we all would have been happy to help.  There are more then 8000 students who have attended Southampton college... there would have been eager to help.   LIU has announced that they plan to close this campus and transfer “The students and faculty (who want to go) to a more complete campus, with better faculties... CW Post.”  Southampton College is to become a campus within a campus at CW Post, we are assured.  Assurances are fine; we have had many of them from LIU over many years.  The assurances that that they would maintain an Undergraduate Facility at Southampton was the first.  More recently we had assurances that all was well and that Southampton was undergoing a great change, a new core curriculum was established, a new Provost installed and a new 100 million dollar building campaign to refurbish and rebuild the campus at Southampton College was announced.  New Faculty had been hired, a deal had been struck with the Parish Art Museum to move onto the Southampton College Campus, a new library was under construction and President Steinberg took great pride in discussing all these new and wonderful developments less then a month ago.   We had his assurances.  Last night he gave us his assurances again...  He assured us that he would carry our request for an open and frank discussion with the board about the opportunity to keep the college from closing and he further assured us that there had been no discussion with anyone and no particular plan to sell the campus had been put into play.  He assured us of this.  He assured us that there has been a continuing effort over many years to find more and better ways of funding the needs of Southampton College.  He assured us it has been an unrelenting commitment form LIU to Southampton College.  But no one ever took the time to tell us how much trouble the college was in, not once in 40 odd years did anyone ever even hint that financial doom was just around the corner..  Not once.  But we have his assurances that all will be well once Southampton College is closed and re-fashioned at CWPost campus.  I am not assured. You should not be assured. You should be greatly distressed and worried as we all are.   Alan Michael Braveman  Former Editor of the Southampton College Windmill 1967-68

       The following letters have been forwarded to the site by Bob Danziger.   "Thursday, July 8, 2004   To:   The Southampton Community From: Bob Danziger  Wednesday night I attended the Angry Alumni Meeting. It was a pleasure to see about 250 people who care so much about the College. President Steinberg and other members of the Administration argued forcefully that the financial picture at LIU (problems at Post and Brooklyn also) leave them no alternative but to close Southampton. President Steinberg gave no explanation about why he has been unable to develop any meaningful endowment for LIU. He argues that courses in the Natural Sciences lose money at Southampton, but I would imagine the same losses might apply to science courses at Post and Brooklyn, so maybe they should eliminate science there also.  The Humanities, Fine Arts and Marine and Environmental Sciences programs evolved over the last 40 years, and as we all know, there are lots of success stories from our alumni. President Steinberg argues that the new curriculum could have saved the College. One might also argue that the improbability of it being successful was actually a foregone conclusion, and realizing that, the Board will finally use the sale of the College's 110 acres as a means of bailing out LIU, demonstrating President Steinberg's fund-raising skill, and making money from Southampton.  I hope there is some kind of white knight out there.  In any case, the following letter is the one that I delivered to The Southampton Press at the beginning of the week. I trust they will print it next week (Viewpoints column). I don't know if it will do any good to explain where the mistakes occurred over the last 20 years, but right now, it can't hurt."   Bob Danziger  July 5, 2004                    The College Goes Belly-up  "At the very first Southampton College faculty meeting I attended, back in September, 1968, there were "Huck Foxy" signs around the campus, as well as (I gather) all over the CW Post and Brooklyn campuses of LIU, calling for the dismissal of President Gordon Hoxie. At the most recent meeting on June 21st, when President David Steinberg and other members of the LIU Administration told us why the Board of Trustees was closing Southampton College, I think there would have been a lot of faculty and staff who would have held "Huck Steinberg" signs, if they had been given any advanced warning of this shocking decision, which flies in the face of the current campus-wide building renovations and construction.  For twenty years LIU probably epitomized administrative mismanagement while under the leadership of David Steinberg. Not only have other private colleges on Long Island (Hofstra, Adelphi, Dowling and St. Josephs) been flourishing, over this period LIU has been unable to develop any kind of an endowment. Faculty disenchantment with Steinberg, at all three main campuses, is probably at its peak right now, but it might be worth describing some of the reasons leading up to the demise of the College.  It would be a mistake to put all the blame on Steinberg. I think some of the gravest mistakes were made by Tim Bishop over the last ten years he was Provost. During that period we had seven (or was it eight?) Academic Deans, at least three Directors of Admissions, a completely incompetent Associate Provost, and a revolving array of other key administrations. The turnover in deans prevented the College from delivering any kind of coherent academic philosophy, or scholarship and financial aid policy. The faculty was invariably rebuffed when information was requested regarding how money was being spent for administration, staff, faculty and physical plant expenditures. At a time when the Marine and Environmental Science programs were winning national acclaim, (in 1997 seven Southampton students won Fulbrights, out of a graduating class of about 250 - the highest percentage of any college or university in the country, and the College should have generated some kind of a "ripple effect", Provost Bishop was never able to communicate the success of our programs to prospective students.  I have always believed that a college must "recruit for excellence" - to try and get the best students, and then to reinforce them when they get here - with outstanding faculty, with Internships and Co-ops which would enable our students to clarify their career goals and to distinguish themselves when they graduated - I don't think Bishop ever really appreciated that.  But it would be unfair to put all the blame on him - after all the turnover in Deans could not have happened without the President (Steinberg) and the Board of Trustees going along with it, and Bishop was always under an incredible amount of pressure. The highest level decisions are made at the University Center in Greenvale, and, of course, there was also a lot of turnover over there during the last ten years; three or four Academic Vice Presidents, and a couple of Assistants to the President. One could argue that Bishop was only "following orders" from the Central Administration, but I think that some of his policies - particularly with respect to scholarship policy - had not only a profound impact on Southampton College, but also on the rest of the University.  In any case, Robert S.F.X. Sillerman, whom Bishop met playing beach volleyball in Southampton, became our Chancellor about 11 years ago, and Sillerman has lots of money. I think Bishop might have been canned six or seven years ago, were it not for the fact that Sillerman was the "money cow" that Steinberg and the Board had been seeking for the past 40 years. Since Sillerman provided the money for the summer "All for the Sea" concerts (presumably supporting the Marine Science scholarships), financing Chancellor's Hall, and the new library, Bishop continued on as Provost. And Steinberg, rather than jeopardize the cozy relationship with Sillerman, allowed Bishop to remain as Provost until Sillerman could promote (ca $500,00+) Provost Bishop's successful campaign for Congress. (I must add that Tim has been a damn good Congressman - probably a better Congressman than Provost). I would encourage everyone to vote for him.  Which brings us around to Chancellor Sillerman, a member of the LIU Board of Trustees. He became interested in transforming the College shortly after Tim Bishop went off to Washington, in January, 2003. When he met with the faculty about six months ago, explaining why he was pushing the "transformation" of the college, he said that when he looked at the College, he saw a "blank slate" - it had nothing to justify its existence in its present form. He felt that we should change into a College with an interdisciplinary curriculum which would address the issues that the youth of America would face in the 21st century. At that faculty meeting I asked how could say that the College had a "blank slate", when there were a couple of hundred alumni who have received their doctorates, many are teaching at universities in this country and abroad, and 37 graduates have received Fulbrights - not what I would call a "blank slate".  But, as Sillerman said in the March 4 issue of the Southampton Press, "I am not trained as an educator" and "I have devoted my life to commercial pursuits, and I've been fortunate to be very successful". In the article Sillerman described how the new curriculum would eliminate standardized test-driven approach prevalent in much of academia". In his words; "Our thrust was to challenge the faculty to design a program that is less focused on teaching the answers to predictable questions, and instead teaching people what those questions are". Hmmm....what does he mean by that??? Would you cough up the highest tuition on Long Island ($25,000 +), for this kind of an education? But these changes were supposed to bring financial stability to the College, adn, as he said "Hopefully", within five years, the deficits would be a thing of the past". I can't help thinking of the old story about the Emperor's (read Chancellor's) new clothes - this new curriculum made absolutely no academic sense, and the aforementioned youth of America (prosepective students) probably recognized it. As I said at the faculty meeting with Steinberg on June 21st (Marine Science metaphor); "The new curriculum went over like a lead balloon; it smelled like a dead fis, looked like a dead fish, and it went belly up".  The Marine Science Program, as it evolved in the early 1970s, consisted of what was essentially a double major; a classic major in Biology or Chemistry, with another 20 credits of Marine Science courses. The new core, according to Sillerman. as he said in the March 4th article, was a "campus-driven intiative", but it was actually orchestrated by Jeffrey Kane, LIU's most recent Academic Vice President, Chuck Hitchcock, Southampton's most recent Academic Dean, and Paul Forestell, head of the Faculty Council and chief cheerleader for the transformation. Faculty from the Natural Science Division were virtually excluded from the deliberations, and there was alway the "Sword of Damocles" over the faculty; if they didn't go along with the transformation, the Board would close us up. the administration dismantled the traditional academic divisions (Natural Science, Humanities, Fine Arts, etc.) and replaced them with smaller programs centered on each major. Kane, Steinberg and Hitchcock eliminated the majors in Chemistry, Cell/Molecular Biology and Sociology, and maybe a few others.  Along with two other members of the Chemistry faculty, I met with President Steinberg and Academic VP Kane at the University Center in July, 2003, shortly after they decided to eliminate the Chemistry major. While rejecting the proposition that a Chemistry major was fundamental to the Natural Science's, Steinberg also went on to suggest that one of the problems at the College was that too many bright-eyed and bushy-tailed prospective students, with the hopes of getting a Fulbright some day, were applying, with hopes of getting a big scholarship (i.e.; discounted tuition). The implication, I suppose, was that we need more rich dumb students.  It is presumptuos for me to suggest to Chancellor Sillerman what he should do with his money. He sold Clear Channel for about $1.5 Billion so I think he has some big bucks around the house. Rather than invest in "bricks and mortar", the "Bishop-Burke Learning Center" (i.e., library, which will probably become an empty shell) and "All for the Sea" concerts, it might have been wiser for him to create about 50 full tuition University Scholarships for outstanding students, some of whom migh actually be interested in the new curriculum. I would bet, however, the majority of them would be interested in our traditional disciplines in Marine and Environmental Science, the Writing Program and Fine Arts..  I really believe the members of the Board, and Sillerman, do have the resources to keep the College afloat. If only Sillerman would acknowledge some of the mistakes that he's made, I think he could save the College, and provide the resources to enable it to fulfill its promise. At a time when the East End's marine and terrestrial environment is under constant pressure from developers and commercial interests, one can only hope htat a white knight may emerge. The other great tragedy, of course, is that the East End is losing its only institution of higher learning, and it will also will lose its major employer. Approximately 300 members of the Southampton Collegs community - facutly, staff and administrators- will be laid off a year from now, and this will have a significant impact on the local economy.  Three years ago we hired six outstanding young scientists; a biochemist, a physical oceanographer, a marine ecologist, a geneticist, a marine mammalogist and a mathematician. Getting a job in academia is not so easy these days, and these men and women all had plans to make a life at the College, just as some of the older faculty did. They bought houses, put their kids in school, and participated in the design of the new core. At the June 21 meeting with Steinberg, when they learned that their efforts were in vain, not suprisingly, there was an overwhelming sense of betrayal.  In some respects though, the people who may be affected the least will be the students. They are young, bright, intelligent and resilient, and with any luck, this will be the worst thing that will ever happen to them. And like the little boy in the story about the Emperor, when they considered the transformation and the new curriculum, they collectively said "Look!! It's wearing no clothes."   Robert M.

        urlLink Provost of Southampton College Daniel J. Rodas      Reporter Clara Jablonski:  "What happens next?"   Daniel Rodas:  "The change is to better serve the educational needs of the students and faculty but in a new location. The new undergraduate core curriculum will go forward as a separate curriculum, but at our C.W. Post campus in Brookville. We will have housing there for the first-year students. Although housing at the Brookville campus is limited, off-campus housing options are being explored. Students will still apply to Southampton College and receive their degrees from Long Island University at graduation.  The graduate programs in English and Education offered at the college will remain at the Southampton campus, as well as the writing program, which has included professors Roger Rosenblatt and Jules Feiffer. Long Island University Public Radio, WLIU, will continue to broadcast from its present location on campus. These programs do no require the same level of support services as the undergraduate programs.  There are a number of options for the future of the marine program facilities and discussions are ongoing. We continue to talk with the Parrish Art Museum who leased nine acres of land from the college to create a privately-funded, state-of-the-art facility. We are actively working with the faculty and staff who will be affected by these changes, and have invited the undergraduate faculty from Southampton to teach at C.W. Post. We are committed to achieving the best possible outcomes in a very difficult situation.  My role is to support this transition and help the students meet their needs. On June 17, we had an open meeting with the students, Charles Hitchcock, Dean of College, and Paul Forestell, the Faculty Chair. The students voiced their concerns. In the first 24 hour period, the student reaction was one of surprise and support for the college and each other. We assured them that their financial aid awards would be preserved. The overwhelming response of the students is "how can I help?"  There is a lot to do. We already have started construction on the $10 million Bishop-Burke Library Learning Center. The exterior will be completed, but the interior will remain incomplete for now. There were other planned projects in the building program, including a 65,000 square foot recreational center, new marine science facilities, and renovations for the dormitories and student union that will be discontinued.  And there are a lot of other things to deal with. There have been concerns raised in regard to the allocation of funds from the college's summer fundraiser. In the past, money raised at the All for the Sea benefits has been used to provide scholarship support for students and that will again be the case for this year's All for the Sea 2004 Rod Stewart concert on August 23.  The unfortunate reality is that it is expensive to run a quality institution. This is a private tuition-dependent college, not a state-run university, and like other institutions, there is an increase in cost over time. Southampton College has utilized resources wisely and prudently, and this is no fault of anyone's. Our ultimate goal is to continue to best serve our students."

        urlLink The Southampton Press  didn't have coverage of the meeting last night in this week's edition, but the cover story is one to check out:  Against all odds, Library Director Robert Gerbereux is trying to save Southampton College. Unfortunately, last week the New York Lottery put those odds at 135 million to 1.   From July 1st, a  urlLink letter to the editor in Newsday :  How to save Southampton  Regarding Sandy McIntosh's op-ed "A fond farewell to Southampton College" [Opinion, June 24]: As a former Southampton College employee in the undergraduate admissions department during the 1980s, it saddens me to learn of the fate of the campus' academic programs. And it distresses me to think that the property will be further developed.  For a college that is nationally known for marine and environmental science programs, isn't it ironic that this may come to pass?  A reasonable solution would be to use the property as a research center similar to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. This would keep hard-working local people employed, maintain the property as is, and could be funded by a combination of private funds and federal, state and local grants.  The only "mansion" on the property should be the one that is already there.   Edward J. Tobin  Sayville  Still looking for articles in the papers that covered last night's meeting. Due to the publishing schedule of East End Papers, I would expect Newsday to have a story about it tomorrow, Dan's Papers to cover it in the Friday edition, but it will be NEXT Thursday to hear anything about it in the Southampton Press and other local papers.

        (My deepest apologies to Heather - her email was lost in my inbox. She sent this to me on 6/25.)    Everyone that went to Southampton, whether they were there for one semester  or four years, is connected to the spirit of that campus. Its alumni are a unique blend of individuals who all chose SC because they felt that connection when they first came to visit. It seems almost too easy for Steinberg and the rest to dismiss our pleas and ideas because they have never felt that spirit. To them it is a business, one in which they poorly managed. How is it that in 2003 the students were told the campus was $55 million in debt and two years later it is up to $77??? Was nothing done to correct this?? Were the admissions staff directed to continue recruiting students mainly from the Long Island area, wealthy students I might add?? This was an admissions tactic that was admitted by Tim Bishop to the students in an open forum, one that he felt was a bad idea and needed to change. Chancellor Sillerman "donated" a great deal of money to the campus which he announced during the 2003 commencement ceremony. Where is this money going towards? How can someone who has such personal ties to the facilities at Southampton (Sillerman's radio station) and who is on the Board of Trustees not see this coming and yet continue to donate his own money??? Has this plan to relocate the undergraduate programs been in the works for awhile, but kept quiet? There seems to be much more going on than the surface shows. And I also heard a member of the Board of Trustees donated $25 million to UCLA, heard anything on this? And if the renovations continue, and if the land is sold, is the university seeking to make a profit? Could this be why they were so willing to sink such much more money into the campus recently? Would it have made a difference for Southampton if the funds from each campus stayed in each campus, instead of collected and redistributed by the university? Oh and what about the infamous new cell phone tower that was built in 2003 behind what I will always continue to call Southampton Hall(I don't even remember what they changed the name to)? Where will the revenue from its occupiers go? Was that really necessary to put the students and employees in danger of a new cell phone tower to make some quick money?

       The meeting with President Steinberg and Provost Rodas is  TODAY, WEDNESDAY, JULY 7th at 7:00PM IN THE AVRAM THEATER . If you will be attending, be sure to sign the attendance sheet. This way there would be a count of all who attend - from staff and faculty, to current students and alumni. Please include your name and class year or years taught or years worked for Southampton College. We need a real count of who showed up to support keeping Southampton College open. Let's not let the University fudge numbers with whom they say attended. There were discrepancies like that when comparing the counts by the organizers of The March For Women's Lives (who had sign up sheets for all involved) compared to the Anti-Choice movement and the local police.   There will also be t-shirts available, sponsored by  urlLink C.L.A.S.S.  The t-shirts are navy blue on white, have the Windmill logo, and say "SAVE THE WINDMILL, SOUTHAMPTON COLLEGE, LONG ISLAND UNIVERSITY". Sizes include medium, large and extra large and the price is a "goodwill offering." They will be available at tonight's meeting and future C.L.A.S.S. meetings and events. You can also get your t-shirt via mail - send Joan Tutt an email (JoanTuttSeashell@aol.com) to get mailing information (I don't want to post her address here). You can make checks for t-shirts and general donations out to: C.L.A.S.S.  If you cannot attend tonight's meeting, there is still time to email your questions and comments to Carol.gilbert@liu.edu or call the Alumni Office at 631-287-8348.

These were John Kanas, who is CEO and Chairman of the North Fork Bank, a Southampton College Graduate, and a member of the Board of Trustees of LIU. 2. Tim Bishop, the former Provost of Southampton College who is now our U.S. Congressman and 3. The new Provost of Southampton College, Dr. Dan Rodas.    urlLink This week , under this same heading, VOICES, we publish the opinions of three other concerned leaders. They are Shirley Strum Kenny, the President of Stony Brook University, which includes Stony Brook University Hospital. 2. Fred Thiele, a graduate of Southampton College and currently our N. Y. State Assemblyman and 3. Harry Marmion, the very respected former President of Southampton College during the years 1972 to 1979.   Next week, we hope to publish the opinions of Bob Sillerman, the Chancellor of Southampton College, and Dr. David Steinberg, the President of Long Island University.

        The  urlLink meeting  with Long Island University President Dr. David Steinberg and Southampton College Provost Dr. Daniel Rodas  has been moved to the Avram Theater, Fine Arts Building , Southampton College.  The meeting is TOMORROW, July 7th at 7:00pm.   Looks like they finally realize more than a few people will be showing up tomorrow and Duke Lecture Hall would not be able to accommodate everyone. Since I will not be able to attend, would there be someone willing to pass along meeting notes, information, etc? Perhaps a photo or two to share?  Another idea -  Would someone please make a sign-up sheet for those who attend?  Include name and class year or years taught or years worked for Southampton College. Let's not let the University fudge numbers with who they say attend.  We need a real count of who showed up to support keeping Southampton College open.

       For the past three years I have had the honor to serve as an Adjunct Professor of Political Science and History at LIU Southampton.  Having previously taught at American University, Rutgers University, Dowling College, Hofstra University, and having served as a federal prosecutor for many years, I feel that I am in a position to make an informed evaluation of the quality of the students and faculty at Southampton.   Over the three years,I have taught scores of dedicated and gifted students who not only eagerly sought to acquire knowledge but, more importantly, sought to apply that knowledge beyond the walls of the academic setting.  It has also been a sincere privilege to work with some of the finest faculty members that I have ever known  Based on my experiences, I felt compelled to respond to the Administration's abrupt and, in my mind, arbitrary decision to eliminate the undergraduate programs at Southampton.   First, I believe that the students, staff, and faculty of LIU should feel betrayed by the way in which the decision to close was reached and conveyed to the community.  For the past months, all of us, to varying degrees, at the specific direction of the Administration, were working on a new core curriculum designed to bring a new sense of vitality and academic excellence to the college.  Now, it appears clear that the countless hours of hard work, the innumerable meetings and discussions, the seeking of input from students and other academic institutions, was done at a time when the Board of Trustees and the Administration were obviously considering and, one might believe, preparing for the closure of the school.  A professor would be sanctioned were he or she to assign a major research project, demand the students work endless hours on that project, and then arbitrarily state that the course was cancelled and all the work was for naught.  And yet, is that not exactly what the Administration has done to each of us?   Second, the duplicity was exaggerated by the fact that, thanks to the generosity of certain donors and the entire community, a new Library is under construction and well on its way to completion.  What possible logic exists for the expenditure of millions of dollars in constructing a new Library while, at the same time, the future users of that facility are being shipped off to CW Post many miles away?  Were I am alumnae or donor who contributed to the building of that library, I would demand my money be returned--otherwise one suspects that they have contributed to a building that will be part of the new condominium or commercial development--enriching the coffers of LIU at the expense of those who loyally and faithfully contributed to the college.   third, if I were an Incoming Freshman, Sophomore or Junior at LIU Southampton, I would feel an ever greater sense of betrayal.  When one applies to and opts to attend a four year college, one expects that they will receive a four year education.  But each of you have essentially had the contract you signed with LIU Southampton unilaterally breached by the Administration.  In announcing the closing, the Administration congratulated themselves for giving the community a one year reprieve.  To that I say, thanks for nothing.  Consider the "choices" that undergraduates face:  (1) incoming freshman can withdraw from their attendance but will find themselves well beyond the application and decision dates at other schools--so your choice is attending a school whose life span is one year or scrambling to try to salvage your first year of college; (2) sophomores will find themselves having paid full college tuition for what will become a two year/community college education in the sense that all of the riches of the upper division classes will be lost forever when the school closes; and (3) juniors will find themselves literally forced to make the switch to CA Post as I know of very few schools who will accept a transfer student to receive a degree when only thirty credits remain  to be completed.  And lest the graduate students believe that they have been "saved," let me suggest that a few hundred student graduate program will not long survive the logic and calculations of this Administration.   Fourth, the fact that the Administration has apparently been actively engaged in the sale of the campus property underscores all of the concerns expressed above.  While real estate is not my field, I can only imagine that the value of this campus property in Southampton is staggering, indeed.  And one only has to think about the controversy and dismay attending the debate over a potential casino, to recognize that a new commercial or residential development is the LAST thing that the Southampton community needs or deserves.  And yet, it would appear, with no input from the faculty, staff, students, alumnae, donors, community, and elected officials, the Administration has demonstrated amazing (and unique) efficiency in moving towards the potential sale of the property.     Fifth, beyond all the substantive concerns expressed above, in my many years of professional work, I have never seen such a poorly handled communications process.  Receiving letters in the mail days AFTER the public announcement of the closing does not reflect a caring and compassionate response to the concerns and needs of the community.  If the Administration is seriously concerned about the "family," then I would assume they will soon announce that a substantial part of the proceeds of the sale of the campus will be directed to the many staff at the school who, come May 2005, will find themselves unemployed.   What will happen to the secretaries, the custodial workers, the food service workers, the librarians, and others--does the Administration seriously expect them to make the move to CW Post (even if such positions were offered them).    In summary, I find myself with truly ambivalent feelings.  On the one hand I mourn for the potential destruction of a fine college and wonderful community of scholars.  On the other hand, I rejoice in the initiative and hard work demonstrated by many of you who are committed to saving the college.  Whether you ultimately succeed or not, I can promise you one thing--as the end of the day, you will feel far more pride and honor in your actions than those who took this action will feel.   To the extent that any of you wish to communicate with me- feel free to e-mail me at wps1952@optonline.net.   Good luck in all your efforts and never forget the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt:   The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today, so let us move forward with strong and active faith.   God Bless    William P. Schaefer

       Are you an alumni with your own blog or website? Send me the link and I'll put it under "Alumni Pages" on the side bar. Our goal is to try to save Southampton College from closing and we also have a great opportunity to network, catch up with, and meet other alumni. The first link is  urlLink Tidewater Bound  but I know there are many more Southampton College alumni, faculty, students, and staff with blogs and websites. Send them in! And thanks in advance!

       Has anyone contacted David Dubin a former adjunct that taught Environmental Law at the College to see if he would be interested in providing some pro-bono work for us?   I believe he is with Twomey, Latham, Shea and Kelly.

        The LIU Administration and apparently members of the Board of Trustees have been cited in newspapers as saying they are getting property appraisals, thinking possibly of selling the campus. If they succeed, it will be too late to consider all alternative measures. There is a question of whether or not "interested parties" can seek a court injunction to prevent that action before it is too late. Injunctions have been used to stop developers until Environmental Impact Statements have been done; other groups use injunctions to stop questionable actions by government agencies and private groups;etc. Are faculty and staff an "interested party"? Alumni? The Southampton/East End townspeople who put up the original money to buy the property and present it to LIU for an undergraduate college, LIU now deciding to terminate the undergraduate college to possibly make a fast dollar from developers? All of those interested legal minds, including all the lawyers who cut their teach as undergraduates at Southampton: where can we move from here? Suggestions?  - By Donald G. Baker

       I came to Southampton College 8 years ago, filled with enthusiasm and probably more optimism and ideas than were reasonable. I am a "Let's put on a show and save the old homestead, ala Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney," kind of person. I have always bucked the odds in my professional career, getting my PhD from Virginia Tech at "ahem" a mature age. And I have developed a passion for teaching the students I have had the privilege of teaching over the last 8 years. I looked forward to keep on lighting the fire for critical inquiry under my students for years to come. Thus, what is happening has caused me to grieve along with many others lamenting the demise of what we had.  A few years ago, I started doing research in Mondragon, Spain. Fifty years ago, during the repressive Franco regime, a few Basque people, taught by a priest and sociologist, about working together as a community, started a cooperative experiment.. They made little camp stoves. Fifty years later, they are a corporation of cooperatives, making many products sold the world over, and providing many services with sales in the billions of dollars (or Euros now). And the Corporation is still based on the idea that one can have a successful business, with democratic decision making, and without exploiting the lowest paid employees.  Under very difficult circumstances, these people committed themselves to principles and ethics that are quite unlike the kind we see in most ventures today and what Franco had in mind for them. They followed a set of principles which included:  a) the primacy of work over capital, without diminishing the importance of money, which is an indispensable element. b) equality of all members-giving one vote to each member, while avoiding egalitarianism so that they could allow a differential in wages in a ratio of one to three;  (Which has more levels these days, but still a ratio is followed - comment mine)  c) supremacy of the General Assembly with solidarity in every thing so that paternalism is avoided; d) money invested in education brings the highest of profits . . .   **Taken from "Prologue" by Juan Leibar of Mondragon, page 12 in  urlLink From Mondragon To America: Experiments In Community Economic Development , written by Greg MacLeod, 1997; Sydney, Nova Scotia: University College of Cape Breton Press.   Faculty have been apprised of the financial problems at Southampton College for a good many years. We followed instructions we were told would help to keep the place going, not without question, but certainly as good employees and dedicated faculty and staff. Direct access to the Board of Trustees is not available, due to some unfortunate situations involving breeches of confidentiality on the part of a few faculty some years ago. In other words, it is not easy in a traditional institution such as this for everyone to have a say in decisions made, nor are they privy to all the information available regarding said institution.   We are led to believe this is the best and only way to ensure a successful enterprise.  I started speaking with various people about an idea I have for a college that would be remarkably different in its administration. That idea was developed in my mind during my visits to Mondragon and while researching the community during the last four years. I conducted a travel class there with a few students in 2000. We saw first hand how many of the cooperatives worked and are still working. We were especially impressed by the University and the schools that are run as cooperatives.  Being a crazy optimist, I feel it's time to put this idea out in a more public forum. We are facing a very tough situation. The financial problems LIU has with Southampton College are very real.  But, I would like the opportunity to explore an alternative college, one that is based upon the principles of Mondragon Cooperatives. The faculty, staff, administration and students would form the cooperative corporation which would encompass a variety of smaller cooperatives. For example, instead of the College acting as landlords for dormitories, students would "own" their dorm room or dorm apartment. They would sell them to the incoming students upon graduation or moving into Winter housing. They would be responsible collectively for making sure the rooms and apartments were maintained in good repair, and perhaps rented out to conferences or other events in the area to help pay for the upkeep. The upkeep, in turn, could be purchased, perhaps as a service from a Maintenance Cooperative which sells their services to the Student Dormitory Cooperative.  I won't go on and on with details or examples of how this could work, but I would like it if people would consider developing this idea and presenting it to the administration.   I met with the dean and faculty of the Massachusetts School of Law on June 22nd. I had written a blurb for the cover of a book,  urlLink Against The Tide  by Debbie Hagan, about the formation of that Law School from scratch, designed so working class students could obtain law degrees. It seemed to join both of my interests, working-class and poverty issues with the cooperative model of capitalism. I made the appointment to meet with them before I heard the news of the relocation of the undergraduate program and possible sale of the land at Southampton College. The luncheon and meeting with MLS certainly took on a different direction. We talked at length about what could be done to save the college without LIU having to carry the burden of the large deficit it has accumulated at SC.   I will give you one example of the suggestions these folks had. Run the college as a cooperative for five years, with option to buy at the end of perhaps five years.  So, we need to develop ideas and ways that offer alternatives to the ones in place right now. I believe it would be difficult to save a four-year undergraduate college located at the present site by protests alone. There must be a way for LIU to discontinue to burden of SC without the losing the college we love. It might mean separating from LIU so the university can concentrate on maintaining the larger, more urban campuses.  I would be happy to discuss this and other ideas people might have at the upcoming meetings. We need a practical plan.

       DEAR C.L.A.S.S.,  Below&nbsp;is information concerning The SC Orientation.&nbsp; It should prove very enlightening!  Thank you Stephanie!  Joan DiPaola Tutt '68, '74  Colonial Legacy Alumni / Save Southampton C.L.A.S.S.   My name is Stephanie and I came home from orientation today. The first two sessions were titled 'Welcome to Southampton College' and 'Transition of Southampton College'. The speakers consisted of student activities director Tara McCarthy, provost Daniel Rodas and president David Steinberg. During the session of 'Transition of Southampton College' parents as well as students were allowed to ask any questions about recent events. Most questions were repetitive from past meetings with Steinberg, as well as the same questions that everyone has been asking. As one may have expected the tension and heat of the room increased until some people began to blow their tops. Steinberg began answering questions in a much louder voice then the tone in which the students and parents were asking questions (one mother began to express her feelings as well, and began shouting). Parents and students became extremely dissatisfied when asking Steinberg if we could raise the money, Steinberg shot down the question directed with a firm 'no'. He then went on to say that he went up and down dune road looking for donations and received no help. He made it clear to parents and the students that our efforts would be a lost cause. Many parents, especially one who directed this next question at him, wanted to know why he took the easy way out and how he could just not try to keep this school afloat. After running his answers into circles he just continued saying that we've been losing money for the past 43 years. There was much more which happened during this hour long discussion but most of it was questions which are unanswerable at this time, however I noticed that Steinberg was gradually becoming very aggravated with so many of the questions being directed at him. I felt that most parents were upset at the fact that he pretty much told us there was nothing to do to save the college and that we are definitely going to C.W. Post. He kept telling everyone that there was no money and there was no way to get the money, however when I talked to most of the students they are willing to do anything they can to keep Southampton going, and don't feel that Steinberg is helping us at all. If anyone has any questions regarding this meeting please contact me back and I would be happy to answer them.  Thank you- incoming freshmen,  Stephanie Beierle  &nbsp; Comments from  John Petrone : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds like Steinberg is getting very defensive. It also sounds like there is no intention to save SC from his part. Like I said earlier I believe the trustees intention all along was to sell off their cash cow (Southampton real estate), and dump the money into the rest of LIU.&nbsp; I am afraid that the only way to save Southampton College is to initiate some kind of litigation against LIU. Anybody been looking into this matter further? Dr. Baker posted a very interesting argument for a basis of a suit, or perhaps some kind of class action by the parents of incoming freshmen? Has Fred Thiel added anything since his last input on the debacle?&nbsp; Any other legal ideas out there?   Comments from  Barbara Peters : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for such a thoughtful report on the orientation.The comment about being up and down Dune Road looking for money isinteresting, especially when considering a recent letter to the editor in Southampton Press from an Alum that stated, in all these years, no one ever asked for money to help the college survive.&nbsp; Good job. You appear to be the kind of student that makes us (faculty members) proud to teach.

       I urge those of you who don't belong to the Save SC mailing list to join.&nbsp; Many great questions are posed there as well as possible solutions.&nbsp; Some important questions are reprinted below: &nbsp; Message from  Lisa Freese : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I'm stupid... but I don't understand something. In the LIU 2001 Anniversary Magazine on page 7 it is stated that in 1985 Steinberg was appointed President. It then goes on to say that during his tenure endowment went up, he has overseen 175 million in new construction ( on what campus?), that new doctorial programs have been added, A CUMULATIVE OPERATING DEFICIT HAD BEEN ELIMINATED... now wait a minute.. cumulative means all LIU Campuses right? So, if all CUMULATIVE OPERATING DEFICITS HAD BEEN ELIMINATED how are we 77 million in debt?&nbsp; It also says that operating reserves have been created &amp; increased.... now, to someone such as myself, fairly intelligent, 4 four year degree, etc... doesn't that mean that there was no operating deficit as of 2001??? And reserves were created??? well, where are they???? Maybe someone could shed some light on this because maybe I am just not reading in between the lines.... &nbsp; From  Barbara J. Peters : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, how do we get this information out? I wondered about the cumulative deficit. When I was 16, I had a little account at a department store. I made angora bows to sell. So, that year, I didn't sell very many, and had a deficit. Now, I don't add that deficit to my debts now. ???? Maybe I'm missing something, not being an accountant?? &nbsp; From  Lisa Freese : Don, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, the actual endowment figures from 2001 are as follows: when he started endowment was 4.4 million, in 2001 it was 45million! I am told that alumni can donate to just Southampton as a restricted donation to come straight to us!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question, We are holding a concert to benefit OUR marines Science division.. Well, there won't be anymore boats bought this year.. so who is that million going to benefit???? POSTor BROOKLYN????&nbsp; So we here at Southampton do all the work and raise the money only to give it to them????  &nbsp; From  Donald Baker : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good th ought. Maybe, since it is Sillerman who sponsors the concert (he usually does; I am assuming it is so for this one, as well), maybe the ALUM group should propose to Sillerman that he put the money that usually goes to SC and marine science into an escrow account to be used for a new SC not under LIU.  &nbsp;

       The following is a statement compiled by C.L.A.S.S.: &nbsp;   LIU Receives Failing Grade in Leadership    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Southampton College alumni reject the notion that the closing of the school is attributed to its location, purported alumni and community disinterest, and the inability of faculty to develop successful programs.&nbsp; The Southampton alumni, based on the limited information provided by the University, maintains that the fundamental cause of the college’s problems can be attributed to decades of apparent mismanagement by the Long Island University leadership.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the period 1962 through 1990 a cumulative loss of approximately $10 million was generated.&nbsp; From 1991 through projected 2005, the cumulative loss will be approximately $67 million.&nbsp; Our assessment is that the accelerating decline in financial performance is attributed to questionable business decisions by the LIU leadership as summarized below:  &nbsp;  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to invest adequately in marketing resources and programs.  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insufficient capital investment and overall maintenance support.  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining an operating structure that limited the ability of local leadership to be effective.  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating a model that could not generate the required cash flow.  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating a curriculum that generated Fullbright scholarships at the expense of financial stability.&nbsp;  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Painting a public picture of success while almost all financial indicators clearly showed the opposite.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;It is the view of the Southampton alumni that the LIU Leadership should be held accountable for the unacceptable financial performance of the College. We are exploring if the alumni should request a thorough review of the LIU leadership decisions by the NY State Board of Regents.&nbsp; This decision will be made by the end of July.  &nbsp;  It is also the view of the Southampton alumni that the LIU Leadership did not vigorously pursue alternative operating models that would maintain the undergraduate program at Southampton College.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the alumni’s belief that the current location on the eastern end of Long Island is an asset - not a barrier - as suggested by the LIU leadership at the July 7, 2004 meeting held with the alumni.&nbsp; While it is true that the sale of the Southampton campus would generate significant revenues to help LIU address its historical disappointing endowments and other funding issues, it is equally true that this site, with the appropriate undergraduate programs, staffing and leadership, would generate both healthy minds and a healthy financial position.  &nbsp;  We recommended to representatives of the leadership of LIU at the July 7, 2004 meeting that they work side by side with the alums and other stakeholders to revisit their plan and to explore alternatives.&nbsp; We also requested that they agree that their decision to relocate the undergraduate program is revocable.&nbsp; We are disappointed that given the urgency of this issue, we have not had a response.&nbsp;&nbsp; While our invitation to work together remains open, we need to pursue other alternatives now.&nbsp; Our next step is to form a team of alums, faculty, community leaders and other stakeholders to pursue privatization and/or an alignment with another University.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Southampton College Alumni Association Board

       "Welcome to the new Southampton College at C.W. Post! I will be your guide to this exciting new facility brought to you through the generosity of the Trustees of Long Island University! Before we begin our tour, does anyone have any questions?"   "This is a hallway.  Is Southampton College going to become a hallway?"   "I see that you didn't bring an open mind. You're seeing the glass as half full! Southampton College at C.W. Post isn't going to be this hallway! It's actually only going to be MOST of this hallway! And the first three classrooms on either side. At least on Tuesdays and Thursdays."   "And all of the undergraduate programs are going to be taught in these three rooms?"   "Well, you see there was no point in moving the English, Social Science, Art or Business programs here, since they were already available at C.W. Post. Many of the Natural Science courses as well. What we are dedicating this space to, for at LEAST one semester, are those courses that were unique to the old Southampton College."   "You mean like the Marine Biology and Writing programs?"   "Well, the Writing program was possible in Southampton because so many gifted writers lived in that area. We are currently looking for gifted writers who live on the North Shore of Nassau county, who while unwilling to teach at C.W. Post, but might be willing to teach at Southampton College at C.W. Post. If we find one, the Writing program may be offered."   "C.W. Post is essentially landlocked. How are you going to teach Marine Biology here?"   "You don't have to go to France to learn French, do you? You have to be flexible. As you can see, the trustees have gone to great lengths to recreate the environment, to capture the feel, so to speak, of the original Southampton College."   "How?"   "For example, we have moved the college dumpsters right outside these 2 classroom windows, to try to recapture the nauseating stench of the old Natural Science building. This sand all over the floor will give students the feel of the shore. And, that puddle that you all had to jump over to get in here will be maintained, rain or shine, in front of the entrance! After all, Southampton College is all about the water!"   "Is that all?"   "No. We hired an aging hippie to paint the words "SMILE! BE FREE!" in white paint of the roof of that tool shed over there. A permanent flow of foul grease, just like the one behind Wood Hall, will stain the road into the parking lot. And, of course, what would Southampton College be without the Windmill!"   "That's a rusty old floor fan!"    "Use your imagination! I mean, it's really old, and it's brown, and it has blades! In fact, this is better than the windmill out there, since it actually works! Just jiggle the plug. There! Can't you just feel those balmy breezes that evoke Autumn and Spring in the Hamptons... Now, let me show you the half of a shelf that has been set aside to store forever the trophies of the Southampton College Athletics Department..."

       Like most alumni I was shocked and saddened by the announcement of Southampton's closing by LIU. My first reactions were anger and disbelief that once again Southampton had to play the Redheaded stepchild to the rest of LIU. My second reaction was the bastards were probably trying to sell the place off because of the value of it's real estate, and my final reaction was to try and figure out what I could do to stop it. I'm heartened and pleased to see the reaction to try and save the college and stop this insanity. The university could save Southampton if it really wanted too, but from everything I've read or been able to find on this subject it seems that the university board made up its mind and are not too willing to listen to any other suggestions. Why go through all the trouble of building a new library, planning a new marine station, renovating the natural science building? This option that they've taken was not done so lightly or over a short period of time. You don't close down a campus without a lot of thought and this option has probably been floating around the board for longer than anyone will ever admit. To echo some of the other comments made on the BLOG, where was the call for help by the university and the college? In the last 18 years since I left Southampton I've made occasional contributions as an alumni when I could, but I'm just a marine scientist who works for a government agency, I don't have a bank account like Mr. Sillerman's. I have had the privilege to recruit a couple of promising marine science students to Southampton and though I lost touch with them I'm glad that they've already graduated because I would feel like I personally betrayed them if they were at the college when it shut down.  I have to admit I don't know what kind of place Southampton is anymore, I haven't been there in 15 years. My graduate education and work has taken me to many different places in this country, but one thing has always remained constant. Wherever there was a gathering of marine scientists (from all kinds of specialties), Southampton was almost always represented, even if it was just myself (which it usually wasn't). In all the places I've worked and studied I've never seen another institution that provided the combination of classroom training with amount of practical field training that Southampton does. Coupled with a dedicated faculty and the natural resources of the east end of Long Island, this program has turned out world class scientists for it's entire history. Does this program bring in lots of money for the university? Of course not, because it's not about the money, it's about the future. I certainly don't claim to be a brilliant scientist, but I love what I do, how could I do anything else. I think it's interesting that the development of the core curriculum was undertaken to provide a more interdisciplinary approach to learning, without all that stuffy academic core that made studying boring. Dr. Danziger hit the nail on the head when he wrote that it "smelled like a dead fish and looked like a dead fish". Marine science is an interdisciplinary field to begin with, you can't understand a biological or ecological process if you don't have a basic understanding the related chemistry and physics that allow that process to occur. Many people I've worked with didn't get that kind of understanding until they got to graduate school, Southampton teaches this same material to undergraduates! Hence, our Fulbright scholars and many distinguished researchers all over the place.  I still don't exactly know what I can do to help save Southampton, I don't exactly live in the neighborhood anymore. But I'm still going to try and I hope all the other Alumni out there feel and react in the same way. I would hate to see Southampton go down without a fight, as I'm sure it won't!

        Rodger   urlLink posted this  in the comments:  Perhaps for those not in the New York area, there could be regional representatives to get information out and "rally the troops?" I'd be willing to help keep contact going in Texas, if you can tell me where to get a list of Texas alumni and let me know how we can assist from afar. I also call on other former Student Government Association presidents to take up the cause as coordinators.  Anyone interested in serving as a coordinator for a regional area or a specific topic here on the blog, send me an email with your name and interest.  I also encourage everyone to get the word out! Send an email to other Southampton College alumni and see if they would like to get involved!

        (From this week's  urlLink Independent Letters To The Editor )   Dear Editor;   Yes, to paraphrase Shakespeare, something is indeed rotten in the state of Denmark. I refer to the sudden, misguided and self-serving proposal by the Board of Trustees, headed up by President David Steinberg and his henchmen, to close the undergraduate program of Long Island University’s Southampton College. It’s no secret now that the board, citing financial losses over “many years,” has decided to terminate all but the minuscule graduate programs and move all undergraduate programs to the C. W. Post Campus. What is still a secret is the board’s thought process over the time leading up to the move, the real reasons for the purported $9,000,000.00 loss in the last academic year (the board has stated simply that declining enrollment is the culprit) and what actions were taken, to enhance enrollment and generate capital, before we arrived at this point.   What has become obvious is that the announced closing reeks of being a carefully calculated plan by some of the Board of Trustees to satisfy their agenda of liquefying their assets and drawing as little attention to themselves as possible. Before the ink was dry on the press release, we came to find out that the board curiously retained a group of real estate professionals to appraise the campus property to see how much it would garner on the open (and very lucrative) market. (Since this revelation, the sharks have been circling, as several different scenarios have been alluded to by various groups, all of which accomplish the board’s agenda: to fragment, spin off or sub-divide the property for purely financial gain.) Timing-wise, it’s not surprising that the University waited until 95% of the students had gone home, some hundreds and thousands of miles away, where they could offer little in the way of organized rebuttal or resistance. Throw in the U. S. Open, when virtually the entire area was caught up in a mania of a different kind, and you have the perfect distraction for Steinberg’s dog-and-pony show to roll into town — good timing indeed!   Rather than spending his days looking for ways to clean up his financial mess and keep the college open, Steinberg seems to find the need to rationalize his and the board’s misguided decision. At a recent function held at Southampton College to honor the president of the Peconic Land Trust, John Halsey, as the college’s man of the year for his many accomplishments in land preservation, Steinberg chose to spend most of the time at the microphone defending his and the board’s decision to close the college and sell off the assets, rather than pay tribute to the guest of honor. Was this his sly way of telling Peconic Land Trust that the college property was up for grabs and they could have it if the price was right? Or was this, in light of dissenting public opinion that was growing by the minute, merely his guilty conscience showing through? Needless to say, more than a few were offended by his disrespectful monologue that took away from Mr. Halsey’s evening. Curiously (and admirably), another board member, Harry Marmion, stepped to the microphone, unscripted, and made it clear to the crowd that not all was as it seemed, that he and some other board members did not feel the same as Steinberg. Stay tuned.   I happened to be with a number of Southampton students, freshmen, sophomores and juniors, the night of the devastating announcement. A sense of shock and sadness, accompanied by a fair share of tears, pervaded the room, but what was most disheartening to me was the looks of helplessness, fear and disbelief that their college — their college! — could betray them in such a way. These were kids who just 24 hours earlier knew that they had found an academic, artistic and social environment where they could thrive, develop and give back to a community that many of them fell in love with at first sight. To see this type of enthusiasm and vibrancy struck down by a few people who forsook the human element in favor of the bottom line was devastating to me, and truly unconscionable. These students made a commitment to the college and the college made a commitment to them. The Board of Trustees, in my view, has an obligation to these students. The offer to relocate them to C. W. Post or to offer academic counseling does not offset the issues of incompatibility in program offerings (last I checked, Post does not have a nationally recognized Marine Science program, probably the biggest draw at Southampton), lost athletic scholarships (what happens to the students who can’t afford to lose that money when Post can’t absorb them on their teams?) or lost transfer credits and money for students who don’t want to move to Post, students who are better suited to a smaller, more rural setting, to name a few. The Board of Trustees, thus far, has failed miserably in addressing these issues.   The economic impact on the East End, particularly Southampton Town, will be staggering. The College is a significant source of employment, with many administrators, faculty and staff residing locally. The many local organizations who benefit from the numerous co-op placements from the college will be devastated. Local merchants, restaurants, pizzerias and such look to the college crowd for a needed financial “shot in the arm” during the long winter months that fill the gap between seasons. Were any of these points considered before the Board of Trustees lowered the boom on 1,200+ students and thousands of residents who will be directly affected? It doesn’t seem likely.   Culturally, the area stands to lose a potential art gallery, a theater group that produces both Broadway and student authored plays, a location for events such as The All for the Sea Concert, Meet the Writers, Pianofest, the Master Theater Class with Alec Baldwin, lecture series’ by area writers and scientists and much more. As for the environment, the East End will lose a great resource and a center for research that in the past has provided valuable insight into the brown tide outbreaks that plagued the local waters. College co-op students and graduates have worked with local foundations in the areas of endangered species, particularly the piping plover, and the rescue and rehabilitation of sea turtles, seals and other sea mammals. These losses, in an area like the East End that truly reflects a fine arts and liberal arts philosophy, would be most tragic.   Here are some things for the Board of Trustees of Long Island University to address, ponder and try to explain to its students and the community at large before following through with their plan (many of us in the community have already done so):   1) Southampton College lost $9 million in the last academic year and $77 million overall? As a recent graduate of Southampton College, my tuition as a full time student was around $23,000 annually, WITHOUT room and board, student activities fees and whatever miscellaneous fees they managed to add on. That would be around $31,000 for the average student staying on campus. While the campus is nice, it is modest in what it has to offer, much more modest than that of C. W. Post, yet their overall tuition is LESS than Southampton’s. We pay more money for less, yet we can’t seem to balance the books. Someone at the college, purportedly in the know, related to me that it was his understanding that the tuition proceeds from LIU’s campuses are pooled, averaged then distributed and the college gets back less than the original $31,000 paid by the student. This would explain a lot. Are the Post and Brooklyn campuses financially healthy? Please, Dr. Steinberg, correct me if my figures are wrong. A lot of very interested people would like to know the truth.   2) Here’s my thoughts on declining enrollment. It doesn’t happen overnight. Neither does increased enrollment. The University set out a year or so ago to address the enrollment issue by revamping departments and curriculums in order to make Southampton a more appealing option to potential incoming freshmen. I must say, in my last semester, I didn’t see any tangible evidence indicating that this plan was in place, but that also doesn’t mean it wasn’t. In any event, a year plus does not seem like enough time to wait to see the fruits of your labors. Who decided to throw in the towel?   3) Other than the aforementioned efforts, what else has been done to attract potential students? Being a married father of two, Southampton was an attractive option for me, logistically (certainly not financially) speaking, as I needed to remain close to home while I completed my degree. Gee, I wonder if there are others out there like me? Why hasn’t the University aggressively targeted my demographic, the adult wishing to complete a four-year program close to home? For many of us non-traditional students on the East End, Southampton is the only viable option. How about a tuition discount for parents who wish to return to school? Relax pencil-pushers, the discounts would be made up over time with the increased enrollment. Other colleges on the Island use radio and print ad campaigns to help recruit new students, young and old. I can’t remember the last ad of this nature I’ve seen that came from Southampton. Or how about an alliance with the Riverhead Campus of Suffolk County Community College, maybe develop continuing programs that compliment the Associates degree and give those students a local option? “Build it, and they will come.”   4) Has the Board of Trustees enlisted any help or insight from local, county, state or federal agencies, if not for outright financial assistance than for leadership and guidance? It’s not embarrassing to ask for help when you need it. Surely Southampton isn’t the first educational institution to find themselves in dire straits, and I doubt they’ll be the last. If politicians and governing bodies have not been enlisted to this point by the trustees, I assure you they will be by the community.   I am not naive. I realize that a private university is a business, and as such, money needs to be made. Strong financial leadership is important, and many if not most of the Board of Trustees have backgrounds in the financial sector — investment firms, banking, etc. This fact is reassuring, and at the same time troubling to me. I fear that the art of making money has (or will soon have) transcended the art of education. We as a society need to build more institutions that provide fertile ground for learning and the opportunity for the individual to grow. Funny, but we already have one of those places right here. Right between Montauk Highway and County Road 39 in Southampton. Let’s not let such a good head start go to waste.   If this letter seems written only out of bitterness, I assure you it is not. I graduated from Southampton in December 2003. While there, I had nothing but positive experiences. The faculty and staff were knowledgeable, understanding and cooperative. I met many incredible people there, faculty, staff and students alike, and I carry those friendships beyond college. It would be an incredible waste to let everything that took so long to build come crashing down, all because of a few individuals who have lost sight of what really makes a college a successful entity — not the bottom line, but the people.

       We need a court injunction, as suggested by Dr. Baker. We have to be careful the land doesn't get sold from under our feet. There has to be time for raising money (which no one asked for during all these years, as mentioned, I believe by Alan Braveman). So many townspeople, staff and alumni would offer financial help. Not only that, Southampton Town (businesses) is sure to be very interested in not letting go of this College that has been an integral part--financially, culturally--of the community for more than forty years.  I am a Southampton College graduate (B.A. 1968 / M.S. 1976). Unfortunately, I now live in Florida, but I will certainly make a small donation. If there is anything I can do on the internet, or mailing stuff from here I would be available for that, or whatever. Let me know.  Sincerely,  Christina Italiani

       SAVE SOUTHAMPTON’S COLLEGE  “Southampton College has come into existence because the people of Eastern Long Island wanted a college and were willing to do something about it.”                                           Chancellor John H.G. Pell 1963  On Friday, July 9th a broad cross-section of the Southampton College Community came together to form” Save Southampton’s College.” We are administrators, alumni, community members, faculty, parents, students and staff. We have united to keep undergraduate education in Southampton. At that meeting, Theater Director Michael Disher urged the committee “to protect the future of undergraduate education. We are not here to save our own individual jobs. Our mission is much bigger than that – we are here to fight for the students and to protect undergraduate education at Southampton.” The Children’s School Director Kathy Bishop noted that our fight “has already attracted the attention of elected officials, the media, and the business community. A groundswell of support exists for Saving Southampton’s College!” Professor Scott Carlin noted that “Southampton deserves a 21st Century undergraduate campus that is intellectually vibrant and ecologically sound. It’s our responsibility to pursue that vision."  The founding vision for Southampton College has produced a campus rich in learning, culture, prestige, and economic value. We are:  •	A nationally recognized Marine Science Program •	A highly esteemed writers and artists Mecca •	A forward thinking Environmental Program  •	An extremely dedicated staff and faculty offering an integrated, experienced based curriculum •	An institution of higher learning and thinking for a group of enthusiastic and  passionate future leaders of our global community. •	A proud legacy of 37 Fulbright Scholars •	The only year-round theater group on the East End •	A tremendous resource that provides our community with extraordinary cultural, environmental and educational programs for children & adults •	One of the larger employers on the East End •	Substantial supporters of the local economy  •	Your neighbor(s)!  Like the founders of Southampton College, we are “willing to do something about it!” to make sure their vision continues to grow and mature. If we do not act now the East End will never be able to replace us in the future.   We must hold onto this valuable resource of ours and not let the Board of Long Island University “relocate” our students, faculty,staff and nationally recognized programs to Nassau County, nor can we allow our land to be sold to developers; Southampton College is so much more than a developer’s piece of dream real estate in the Hamptons. As our mission statement states:  Southampton College is dedicated to creating an environmentally sustainable and humane world through critical thinking, creativity, and global citizenship. The curriculum emphasizes academic excellence, inter-disciplinary, and experience based learning, and full advantage of Long Island’s marine, environmental, literary, and artistic wealth. Our mission is to empower students to care for the world.  We must let our friends, families, neighbors, business associates and politicians know that we need their help to preserve one of the East End’s treasures that is about to be lost to major land developers. We will speak loudly and clearly: we must “Save Southampton’s College!”  In coming weeks we will be announcing public events and other opportunities for the public to join us in celebrating Southampton College and building a new College for this new century!  * * *

       I thought that all of us may propose another solution for LIU to raise about $60 million. I believe that the CW Post campus sits on about 300 acres of land – in Greenvale, property equally as valuable as land in Shinnecock Hills. Why not suggest that they sell off about 50 acres of CW Post land, dispose of Steinberg who, according to the figures presented, has only raised $40 million in 20 years. When the Administration talks about the high discount rate, as they acknowledged, the discount rate at other colleges is not significantly different. The reason LIU and Southampton are in trouble is that there’s no endowment backing it; e.g.; compare LIU with Susquehanna College and Swarthmore. Anyhow, if there is a concerted effort by faculty, staff, the alumni and the community, we may still be able to save the College.   Bob D

         To all Southampton College Alumni:  Enclosed as an attachment to this communication, please find a statement of the Southampton College Alumni Association's position, on behalf of its membership, based on our discussions following the July 7, 2004 meeting with representative of Long Island University. This statement is being&nbsp; distributed&nbsp; electronically to&nbsp;Southampton alumni&nbsp;at the request of&nbsp; your &nbsp;Alumni Association President Greg Connly '85. It may also be obtained by contacting the Alumni Office at 631-287-8348. &nbsp;&nbsp;     LIU Receives Failing Grade in Leadership  &nbsp;   Southampton College alumni reject the notion that the closing of the school is attributed to its location, purported alumni and community disinterest, and the inability of faculty to develop successful programs.&nbsp; The Southampton alumni, based on the limited information provided by the University, maintains that the fundamental cause of the college’s problems can be attributed to decades of apparent mismanagement by the Long Island University leadership.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For the period 1962 through 1990 a cumulative loss of approximately $10 million was generated.&nbsp; From 1991 through projected 2005, the cumulative loss will be approximately $67 million.&nbsp; Our assessment is that the accelerating decline in financial performance is attributed to questionable business decisions by the LIU leadership as summarized below:&nbsp;  &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Failure to invest adequately in marketing resources and programs.  2.&nbsp; Insufficient capital investment and overall maintenance support.  3.&nbsp; Maintaining an operating structure that limited the ability of local leadership to be effective.  4.&nbsp; Operating a model that could not generate the required cash flow.  5.&nbsp; Operating a curriculum that generated Fullbright scholarships at the expense of financial stability.&nbsp;  6.&nbsp; Painting a public picture of success while almost all financial indicators clearly showed the opposite.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It is the view of the Southampton alumni that the LIU Leadership should be held accountable for the unacceptable financial performance of the College. We are exploring if the alumni should request a thorough review of the LIU leadership decisions by the NY State Board of Regents.&nbsp; This decision will be made by the end of July.  &nbsp;  It is also the view of the Southampton alumni that the LIU Leadership did not vigorously pursue alternative operating models that would maintain the undergraduate program at Southampton College.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the alumni’s belief that the current location on the eastern end of Long Island is an asset - not a barrier - as suggested by the LIU leadership at the July 7, 2004 meeting held with the alumni.&nbsp; While it is true that the sale of the Southampton campus would generate significant revenues to help LIU address its historical disappointing endowments and other funding issues, it is equally true that this site, with the appropriate undergraduate programs, staffing and leadership, would generate both healthy minds and a healthy financial position.  &nbsp;  We recommended to representatives of the leadership of LIU at the July 7, 2004 meeting that they work side by side with the alums and other stakeholders to revisit their plan and to explore alternatives.&nbsp; We also requested that they agree that their decision to relocate the undergraduate program is revocable.&nbsp; We are disappointed that given the urgency of this issue, we have not had a response.&nbsp;&nbsp; While our invitation to work together remains open, we need to pursue other alternatives now.&nbsp; Our next step is to form a team of alums, faculty, community leaders and other stakeholders to pursue privatization and/or an alignment with another University. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  - Southampton College Alumni Association Board

       This is from  Kathy Bishop , an alum that heads up The Children's School on campus.&nbsp; Her father was Dean Burke.&nbsp; Her husband is former Provost, Rep. Tim Bishop. &nbsp;  Joan, &nbsp; Please pass this on to others for me.&nbsp; I am very distressed by some of the negative outburst some of our faculty have had recently. They only "cut off our nose to spite our face." It shows such a narrow view of the whole picture and it sends the wrong message out to those we hope will support us.&nbsp; We need to let the public know about the significant difference we have made in the lives of so many graduates and the wonderful effect we have had on members of all ages of our community from the Theater's Southampton Players, to The Children's School, the Creative Retirement and the many other programs. I think it is important to focus on the tremendous support and hard work that Laura and Bob Silllerman have given to this college; more than any other single board member has ever given to any campus of the university. I also believe that in spite of the lack of support from the majority of the LIU board Tim Bishop and many other hard working and dedicated members of the college community devoted endless hours to the survival of this college that has struggled from the start. Even now when we face our darkest times they are all still out there fighting for our continuation because they recognize our strengths and our value to the community. We as a college community need to say thank you to those who have fought for our survival and we need to stop the finger pointing in the public arena that only outlines one important reason why we will not be able to move forward. Anything positive that has ever happened here has been from hard work not negative rhetoric. &nbsp; Thank you, Kathy

       From:  Don Baker  Subject: your photo-op &nbsp; Alan, Nora: Your comments brought to mind another thought: why not a petition signed by local merchants(maybe Riverhead, Hampton Bays, East Quogue, Bridgehampton, etc., as well, protesting the closing of the college, as it will have a decided impact on them.&nbsp; What about a rallying petition or something of the sort collecting signatures or comments (brief ones, but a list of them, from such as Spielberg, Alan Alda, and all the other film/theatre, etc. people out here that can be a brief statement with all their signatures, and run it in the local papers, on Channel 12, Newsday, etc.).&nbsp; And are there any theatre programs going on on the campus, where signatures to a similar petition could be acquired?&nbsp; And contact Ana Daniel, who is an adjunct history professor and one of the big-wigs in the Sag Harbor theatre group; she maybe (or others) could get similar signatures from those patrons of the arts.&nbsp; That's just the beginning: I'm sure all of you can come up with additional local East End groups thatneed to get involved with their voices.

       Written by  Donald Baker   &nbsp;  The Newsday article, unfortunately, simplfies the closing in terms of two things: economic problems (low enrollment) and Sillerman vs. Tilles, and doesn't really get at the fundamental issues, as the alumni and others have pointed out: inept management, evident for at least two decades, management that, unless one knew otherwise, could be construed as aimed at closing the institution. Clearly, at least in my opinion, the "noble effort" to move the college to C.W. Post as an act of compassion is, in fact, a charade, assuring the death of Southampton College in exile within two years.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There are two issues that need to be addressed, hopefully by the Board of Overseers and all those concerned with preserving Southampton College:&nbsp;  1. Is Southampton College vital, essential, and invluable not only to Eastern Long Island but also to the kinds of students, from afar as well as local, that it could recruit? &nbsp;And how does it benefit the local area in terms of research (marine, environment, sustainable development, community problems and social change); in terms of working with local schools and programs and teachers; and culturally, with year-round programs as well as others that could be developed.&nbsp; And:&nbsp;  2. Is it financially viable as an institution. Yes, but not as part of Long Island University. And the yes would mean thinking creatively about incorporating new features: (a) a marine science program as part of SUNY but remaining here. but students would also takeliberal arts courses and live in dorms of SC as aprivate institution (see similar arrangements, where SUNY school of ceramics follows this model on the campus of private Alfred University; ditto for SUNYcollege of forestry on the Syracuse University campus;&nbsp; and SUNY agriculture for a long while as part of rivate Cornell University), with SUNY picking up costs for science laboratories, marine station, library resources, boats, etc., all part of marine science, hence not coming from the SC part of the budget; (b) an expanded liberal arts program, which costs very little in way of equipment etc. in contrast to marine science; (c) an expanded summer and year-round cultural activities program, in theater, journalism, writing programs, music, as well as lecture series (NYC's "Y" programs here) etc. especially in the summer but also year-round which could recruit funds especially from the NYC and arts/film etc groups that live part-time in eastern Long Island; and (d) as Dan Rodas had been working on, some kind of an arrangement where private entrepreneurial groups build new dormitories and lease them to the college, the dorms, including numbers of apartment style living arrangements as well as the normal dorms, all air conditioned, rental in summer to outside families as well (but first priority would go to students, possibly a summer theater and musical groups, such as at Saratoga in the summer), etc. The East End is reaching a "critical mass" of people of diverse backgrounds and interests, and they could be drawn upon, as well as the local community (as it begins to recognize the value of the college to the community), in terms of the recruitment of funds--that fund recruitment done here at the college, now independent(Steinberg said he "went up and down Dune Road looking for funds, and no one would give"--that attitude, and the indifference of the LIU fund recruiters over the years to Southampton College needs, as attested to by alumni all over the country, shows why development/fund activities for SC up to the present have been so miserly and need to be conducted at SC.&nbsp;  LIU's blatant closing of the college (Newsdayattests to that) reminds one of factories in the North over the decades that moved their factories to the south, away from labor unions. Or the "outsourcing" that is now going on by companies: move the establishment far away from those costly objects (faculty, students, etc) so they can't follow (how many eastern Long Island students are going to drive to Post when St. Josephs and Dowling, among others, are closer?).&nbsp;  &nbsp; Deja vu? Ask John Strong, who has written an article for Southampton Press on an earlier LIU leader by the name of R. Gordon Hoxie who tried to sell off the Brooklyn campus in 1947; his response to the Brooklyn students and faculty: "Oh, Brooklyn's deficitis hurting the rest of LIU, so we must close it; sorry about that, but you students and faculty are welcome to teach or finish your program at Post (50 miles away from Brooklyn) or Southampton (100 miles away from Brooklyn)". That dismembering of LIU was ultimately prevented, but it did lead to the firing of that leader before he could dismantle the university. The fact that Southampton College has lasted this long, given the caliber of leadership LIU has had over the past couple of decades, suggests that it can be a viable institution, and certainly viable if separated from LIU and restructured possibly along the lines suggested above--or something like this proposal. Possibly, from this&nbsp;restructuring, it might well be possible to recruit the necessary funds from the diverse groups that are in eastern Long Island. This would be "their" institution as they worked hand in hand with alumni and other groups to make it the kind of institution envisoned by Ed Glanz, who founded the college, and whose vision was of a college that focuses on its environment: a humanities program that incorporated the local artists and writers; a marine science program that dealt with the sea; a social science program that turned out students intent on working for social change and a better environment for all of us to live in; an education program that worked closely with the surrounding schools to assist them and their teachers in turning out students interested in making their lives and the lives of others better; and a business program that turned out people with the entrepreneurial spirit to participate in America's economic development.  &nbsp;  From:  John P. Petrone   Subject: Re: todays newsday  &nbsp;  This article disturbed me tremendously! LIU does not deserve to run SC anymore. Did everyone notice that Roger Tilles offerred to keep SC open if Mr. Sillerman kicked in five million dollars a year? The college was treated like a red headed stepchild from day one, and the fact that it appears that personalities and egoes played a role in this debacle is outrageous. I think Tilles is enjoying spearheading the termination of SC just to stick it to Mr. Sillerman. I am sickened!&nbsp; Has anyone approached Mr. Sillerman to let him know that there are eager interested parties out there that want to see an independent Southampton College? If the Save SC effort could gain Mr. Sillerman as a proactive ally in thwarting LIU's efforts to sell the college away, he would be a most powerful addition. I wonder if the Chancellor could be persuaded to join the fray on our side? How about approaching Tim Bishop to solicit our ideas to the Chancellor? Hey Mr. Sillerman, how does the title of President for Life of Southampton College sound?  &nbsp; Each time a person stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, they send forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and injustice.- Robert F. Kennedy---  &nbsp;  From:&nbsp;  Barbara Peters   &nbsp;  I felt sad, angry, betrayed. We spent so much time and energyworking on the new curriculum...often undoing one week what we had done the previous week and returning to what they'd told us we had to do three weeks earlier. Everyday was filled with stress. We came to work, ready to teach and someone would come down the hall, shaking her/his head and we'd say, "Now what?"  &nbsp;  I especially did not like the way Bob Sillerman was protrayed. Chancellors Hall could have been named Sillerman Hall, like the Tilles Center, but no . . . it gave credit and honor to past and future chancellors.  &nbsp;  Bob may not have been a trained educator, but he did understand that learning had more to do with learning to think than it had to do with numbers.  &nbsp;  SAD, SAD, SAD.

       No matter what I do the formatting gets screwed up, so I apologize for the lack of paragraphs...  Thanks to  Rocksroy Bailey  and  Bill Barbari  for forwarding the article to us!  &nbsp;  East End  The little college that couldn't  &nbsp;  BY MICHAEL ROTHFELD AND OLIVIA WINSLOW  Staff Writers  &nbsp;  Robert F.X. Sillerman, a self-made billionaire who built his fortune in the entertainment industry, decided at age 45 to become chancellor of a plucky college in the Hamptons, where he hoped to inspire younger generations with the free-thinking lessons he had learned growing up in the 1960s.Chancellor Sillerman, who drew only $1 a year in salary, loved Southampton College so much he pledged $20 million toward the campus' capital improvement project and raved to one and all about its innovative new undergraduate curriculum designed to encourage "social responsibility."But in May, after serving more than a decade as the small college's top supporter and benefactor, Sillerman received stark news. His most personal venture was about to be decimated.Trustees and administrators at Long Island University, the college's parent institution, told him enrollment was down significantly and the school was hemorrhaging more money than ever. They said Southampton College would not survive without an annual infusion of $5 million -- implying that Sillerman could simply write a check each year to rescue his pet project."I didn't comment on it at the time because I thought that their behavior was actually erratic," Sillerman said.The trustees, headed by chairman Roger Tilles, a Great Neck real estate developer with whom Sillerman has a tense relationship, had watched in dismay for years as the little college drained revenues from their two more profitable campuses. Nonetheless, they gave Sillerman one last chance to open his wallet."If Bob had wanted to, there certainly was every opportunity to do that," Tilles said. "And he has been very generous, and we just assumed that wasn't something he was willing to do."Sillerman went home and discussed the bailout plan with his wife. "Laura and I made the decision that this group of people, acting and operating the way that they were, were not people who we wanted to be the sole solution for," he said.Shocking surpriseAnd so on June 15, with Southampton College's deficit for next year projected at $12 million, the highest in 40 years of losses, the trustees -- Sillerman among them -- effectively shut down the school. They voted to transfer its undergraduate programs to their C.W. Post Campus in Brookville beginning the fall semester of 2005.The decision marked the death of the intimate school founded in 1963 on the ideal that an academic community could thrive in one of Long Island's most stunning landscapes, buoyed by the wealth nearby. After scraping by for its entire existence, the college's final weeks came down to a standoff between two rich and powerful men. One of them likened it to a mortal duel.Why did Southampton College fail? The answers aren't so simple, according to interviews with dozens of people within the university system and the community.They point to the lack of an endowment, to mismanagement, a 40-year identity crisis, insufficient support from LIU and from the college's well-to-do neighbors, physical neglect of the campus, and the general complexity of operating an institution of higher learning on a budget of next to nothing. And out of that has resulted deficits projected to reach $77 million by the end of the next school year.Although the college produced 37 Fulbright scholars, most from a pioneering marine sciences program, and has won praise for its graduate writing program, the school struggled with its image and had trouble attracting undergraduates who could afford the $20,000 tuition."We have reached a point where the board was asked, 'Do you keep the patient going artificially or not?'" LIU president David Steinberg said. "At what price to the rest of the institution, which is healthy? ... We would prefer to run a small, residential college on the East End. We don't have the money."The LIU board's decision to kill the college was so swift and harsh no one saw it coming, not even Sillerman. The new library was nearly complete, the new curriculum was about to debut, the students were on their way home for the summer. Sillerman said they were on course to turn the college's fortunes around.And yet Tilles and the 40-member LIU board of trustees had made their decision and given up on the college as constituted. Said Tilles: "What we had planned even a year ago was not going to work."More than one trustee implied the board had grown weary of Sillerman and his creative ideas. "This was a guy that just wanted to experiment with the university's money," said a trustee who asked not to be identified.Sillerman still has some fight left in him. He promises to be "an obstacle" if the trustees opt to sell the 110-acre campus for real estate development."I will be Aaron Burr to his Alexander Hamilton," Sillerman said, referring to Tilles.Local leaders had long dreamt of founding a high-quality liberal arts school on the East End. They convinced LIU to take on the venture and raised money toward the purchase of the property. But from the beginning, the stewards of Southampton College struggled to make ends meet and had a difficult relationship with LIU overseers.Lovely siteThe college sits on a series of gently rolling hills that are bordered on the north by the renowned Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, four times home to the U.S. Open, and on the south by the lush Native American reservation of the Shinnecock tribe. Despite its proximity to some of the region's most lavish estates, the school lost money right away, running an $87,000 deficit in 1962, the year before admitting its first class of 249 students. Within a few years, Southampton's liberal arts college began to assemble a strong contingent of scientists on its faculty and developed a marine science program with a national reputation, in which students had access to underwater laboratories, studying brown tide and seals wintering in the Long Island Sound.The school cultivated a loftier image than LIU's campuses in Brooklyn and Brookville; those places offered trades-oriented programs, but Southampton rejected cooking or hotel classes that might have made money."What we found was a commitment to a quality, liberal arts education and not just preprofessional training," said Jeffrey Kane, LIU's vice president for academic affairs.But the college could not compete for students with elite schools such as Wellesley and Haverford. Its student body actually had more in common with LIU's other campuses, in that many who went were the first in their families to attend college and needed financial aid. Jason Rodriguez, 20, a junior from the Bronx, said he chose the school because he has to pay only $2,000 a year. "I wouldn't be able to go to college without a ridiculous amount of loans," he said.Without an endowment, the school relied almost entirely on tuition for sustenance. Of LIU's current $40-million endowment, only $1.4 million is for Southampton. And enrollment, which fluctuated between 1,000 and 1,300 over the last two decades, did not pay the bills, especially with a financial aid burden equaling about 35 percent of tuition. In the last school year, Southampton spent an estimated $31.1 million, 38 percent more than its $22.5 million in revenues.Harry Marmion, Southampton's president in 1972, said there never seemed to be much of a vision from LIU headquarters in Brookville. "It was inadequate planning, abrupt planning, no planning," he said. "They built a gym, a brand-new gym, gave me the keys and said, 'You pay for it,'" said Marmion, 73, who still lives nearby. Mandates to cut kept coming: eliminate the president's job, suspend the academic dean for a year, trim financial aid. They let facilities age and did not build new ones. The library and athletic facilities were high school-caliber, the dormitories were run-down and small. There were only 13 or 14 classrooms on campus. A 1993 report by a college accreditation team called Southampton a "leader in experimental learning," but said inadequate facilities "impacts quality of teaching and student learning and student life."Tim Bishop, the Southampton Democratic congressman who worked at the school for nearly three decades, rising from admissions counselor to provost, said he begged the university for help but was rebuffed. "There was not apparently sufficient resources on the part of the university to invest," Bishop said. "And as a result, we continued to slip."Steinberg agreed: "You can't build with spit and Scotch tape," he said.Niche schoolBishop decided to cater to the school's niche, marine science, which he said was "without any question the most attractive program we had." Nearly three-quarters of Southampton's students came for that program, he said, though some switched to other majors.But the approach had problems. On campus, faculty members and students in other disciplines resented the financial favoritism given marine science, which political science professor Donald Baker called "a massive sinkhole." By dropping courses in other social sciences and humanities, the school lost potential students, he said.Even in marine science, there were not enough resources. Sandra Shumway, the program's former chairwoman, said by the 1990s, Southampton had lost its competitive edge. While administrators were "believing their own publicity, these other programs were moving forward at a rate of knots," said Shumway, now a researcher at the University of Connecticut."The bulkhead [at the marine station] was falling in, and they didn't have any money to repair it." When prospective students came, Shumway wouldn't take them to the marine station because she feared "they would be put off."With all aspects suffering and the post of chancellor vacant, Bishop turned in 1993 to a friend: someone he had met 15 years before through a co-worker at the college; a man with whom he had played volleyball on the beach; a flamboyant, wildly successful entrepreneur. He turned to Robert F.X. Sillerman.Sillerman, 56, has a dramatic way about him. He quotes Oscar Wilde, compares himself to mythological figures and refuses to say what the X initial stands for. In fact, he gave it to his 10-year-old daughter, Mackinley, and has yet to let her in on the family secret.He grew up in Morningside Heights in Manhattan and graduated from Brandeis University outside Boston. He quickly established himself as a shrewd and savvy businessman, buying and selling radio stations, amphitheaters -- including the one at Jones Beach -- and ticketing companies, and he also managed broadcasters and athletes.In 2000, while he was executive chairman of SFX Entertainment, Clear Channel Communications bought the publicly traded company for $4.4 billion in stock and debt. He had risen on his own ingenuity."It's funny, people ask me what I'm trained in," Sillerman said. "I guess if I'm trained in anything, it's marketing, but you know, I'm self-taught."Sillerman lives in Manhattan, but he and his wife, Laura Baudo Sillerman, have developed a network of friends in Southampton since the 1970s, where they own an oceanfront home. It turned out practically everyone they knew had close ties to the college. "Our circle of friends out here had been derived exclusively from people who devoted their sweat and blood to this college," Sillerman said.Sillerman is a good friend to have. He told Newsday he is paying for the college educations of 11 children of his friends, including the Bishops' two daughters. Out of devotion to the same crowd, Sillerman said, he agreed to become chancellor. "We started off kidding around about the job," Bishop recalled. "And I said, 'Would you be interested?' And he said he needed to know more, but he said he would be interested."Sillerman, who took a helicopter to Southampton on his first day of work, said he had wanted to help students think creatively and ask questions rather than give rote answers. And he saw an opportunity to mold this little college that lacked history or tradition."It still is very young, and so there was no need to pay homage to the past," Sillerman said.By the time Sillerman took over, Southampton College had lost $16.5 million in its first three decades. It has lost $48 million more in his 11-year tenure as chancellor.Entertainment connectionsSillerman began by recruiting, through his entertainment connections, stars such as Paul Simon, Tina Turner and Bob Dylan, to All for the Sea, the college's annual summer fund-raising concert Bishop started in 1992. The event raised up to $1.2 million in a single year.Traditional fund-raising was much harder, as professional fund-raiser Tom Lloyd learned when he arrived on campus in the mid-'90s to solicit for the capital fund. The campaign Lloyd led raised $13 million over five years, half what the university had hoped for, in part because summer residents were more interested in New York City charities than the local college. "They wanted their children to go to Amherst and Yale and Harvard," he said.The alumni base -- a few thousand young graduates in nonlucrative fields -- didn't provide much support, either.The best source was Sillerman, but exactly how much of his own wealth he has given makes for fuzzy math. He estimates $15 to $25 million, but some trustees say it was closer to $10 million. They acknowledge he also brought in donations from other contacts and events such as the concerts.Agent of changeSillerman was not a typical donor, both in that he helped make policy and tried to leverage his gifts, requiring for instance that the university find $2 million in exchange for $1 million from him. Sillerman saw himself as an agent of change, not just a cash cow."Bob is arrogant, very assertive, sometimes bull-headed," Shumway said. "He didn't get where he is by being John Q. Milquetoast, but those aren't necessarily bad assets."By 1996, the school at last could afford to build something. Chancellor's Hall, a modern academic building, opened in 1998.That same year, in an effort to capitalize on the abundance of authors in the area, the school started a graduate writers' program boasting Roger Rosenblatt, a well-known essayist with a home in Quogue, as its marquee faculty member. (The college paid him $217,000 in 2001.) The program, which spun off an annual writers conference in July, has become extremely successful, with authors such as Peter Matthiessen, E.L. Doctorow, Frank McCourt and others.But then, Sillerman said, he decided to market the school nationally and raise admission standards in the hope of building a smarter and more affluent student body. The bold move backfired: enrollment declined, from 1,312 in 1999 to 1,198 in 2000.Sillerman admits now this was a mistake, that he was influenced by the buzz in the community: "There was a lot of, 'Oh my gosh, I thought it was a community college, I thought it was part of the state university system, I had no idea it's as great as it was ... ' And I overestimated that."Tilles and Sillerman clashed often. Sillerman looked out for Southampton's interests and Tilles presided over the entire university, but people at Southampton always felt he favored the C.W. Post and Brooklyn campuses and some even said he stocked the board with others with similar loyalties. They are both rich, enjoy high profiles, have healthy egos and are given to philanthropy, according to those who know them.Tilles, 58, who earned his law degree in Michigan, returned to Long Island in 1983 and joined his family's real estate business. The Tilles Center for the Performing Arts at the C.W. Post Campus is named for his parents.Sillerman operated in flashier circles and had created his own wealth."I think you had two very powerful men who sort of jockeyed for position," said a person who has worked with both men. Sillerman was reportedly furious when Tilles, a Democrat, at first backed Republican incumbent Felix Grucci in the 2002 congressional race.And Sillerman wasn't happy after Tilles and the board commissioned a study the same year to ascertain how Southampton College could get out of the red.The study's conclusion: the college needed a $100 million endowment to generate $5 million in interest. Sillerman scoffed, calling such a solution "fairy-tale land."John Kanas, an LIU trustee, bank president and Southampton graduate, said a committee discussed closing the campus and "what changes might be made to try to stem the leakage." Sillerman, Kanas said, went into marketing mode and "convinced the remaining trustees that the way to go about bringing change in Southampton was to repackage the curriculum."The new vision, announced last year, included a capital campaign. The school would undertake a $60-million building plan to include a library and learning center and a new gymnasium. The Sillermans agreed to contribute $20 million if LIU would put up the rest."His ego was driving the process," said a trustee who asked not to be named. "And the board, since he threw some money out there on his own and hung out the prospect of giving them even more, they were sort of seduced by it."Huge capital expansionSillerman's salesmanship and offer of $20 million launched the huge capital expansion and set new programs in motion. He was clearly excited about the school's future just two months ago as he talked with members of the campus community about the building plans and dynamic new curriculum, which would "empower students to care for the world."He spoke of "the vision of the new campus, the new curriculum," recalled student Nancy Boland. "How it was new and exciting and it would take, oh, three to five years" to implement.Sillerman could already point to the nearly completed brick frame of an airy new library that was to be called the Bishop-Burke Library Learning Center for the congressman and his father-in-law, former dean Bill Burke. (In all, 10 members of Bishop's extended family have been employed at the college.)But the college's financial picture was continuing to unravel. Enrollment, which had been 1,276 in 2002, when the plan was hatched, was 1,105 in the school year just ended, and was not expected to increase next year. The annual deficit, as a result, increased to $8.6 million. And next year's deficit was projected to hit $12 million. Sillerman got the bad news the same day he visited campus, he said.Tilles said he and the trustees wanted the plan to work, but they could not afford to see it through. "There were several assumptions that were made," he said. "One was that as we invested more money in the campus and changed the curriculum, we would attract more students and wouldn't lose existing students, and that assumption was a bad one."According to Tilles, the goal was to keep the deficits to $5 million or reduce them. Instead, said Steinberg, the finances spun out of control: "It's just that they've reached a point where they have gone through a zone, like the sound barrier," he said.Sillerman, however, said the faculty strike at C.W. Post last fall, which hurt LIU's finances, made trustees less willing to fund Southampton's losses.For his part, Sillerman said he chose not to resuscitate the college with a $5 million check because the LIU board reneged on its commitment to the $60-million revitalization plan."If people were going to act that way, then count me out," Sillerman said Wednesday.As a trustee, he went along with the vote to transfer most of Southampton's programs to C.W. Post.To date, Sillerman has turned over less than $1 million of the $20 million he promised LIU for Southampton College's capital campaign.In Southampton, the community has been reeling since the news broke. "We as a community weren't ready for it," Edwin Schwenk, an East End activist, said. Southampton Village Mayor Joe Romanosky Jr. has vowed to do whatever he can to get the decision reversed. The alumni say they feel robbed.The university has said its graduate programs, in education, writing, business administration and accounting, will remain in Southampton. Some faculty will be invited to C.W. Post, but others and nonacademic employees will surely lose their jobs or retire. The future of the marine science program is unclear, although there have been discussions about taking it over with the state-run Stony Brook University, which has a similar graduate program.LIU has hired a law firm to explore selling the property, and Tilles says it will probably be sold, though for what purpose has not been decided. Sillerman, meanwhile, insists it will remain the site of an educational institution. "There will not be a Wal-Mart there, I can tell you that."Last week, LIU officials met with Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy to discuss a venture with Suffolk Community College. Southampton's Parrish Art Museum -- which had planned to build a $35-million to $40-million museum on campus -- is reportedly exploring its options.Sillerman refused to divulge his plans, but he hinted he would make them public by the next trustees meeting in October. Would he remain chancellor? Would he donate another dollar to the university? "Ask me that in October," he said, explaining he does not want to disturb the "healing environment."Sillerman said he was "deeply disappointed" by his own flawed decisions and in the university for breaking its word. Wearing shorts and a polo shirt and sporting a tan in Chancellor's Hall, he seemed resigned and sad."There really was an opportunity to do just what I had hoped ... to redefine higher education in the 21st century."

One of the things that we are going to request is for people, and that means anyone, send in their "evidence" "rememberances" and so on re: SC. How would their lives have been different without the college here? How have their lives been impacted by the presence of the college. These can be big and little ways and can be sent to us as videos, audio tapes, photos, scrapbooks, writting testimonials and so forth. &nbsp; These things will be on display at the celebration. And there are plans to make a video based on "It's a Wonderful Life."

       Dear Bloggers,  I sent a letter to New York State Senator Caesar Trunzo and would like to share his response with you.&nbsp; Please write to your&nbsp;elected officials and ask that they support&nbsp;us in our &nbsp;efforts to "Save Southampton's College!!!"        Dear Ms. Detweiler:   Thank you for your letter regarding the decision by Long Island University to close undergraduate programs at Southampton College.   I would like to take this opportunity to state that I understand and share your concerns. I have been in contact with Senator Kenneth LaValle, Chairman of the State Senate Education Committee, whose district Southampton College falls under.&nbsp; Senator LaValle has been meeting with state and local officials to discuss the future of Southampton College.&nbsp; The agreement is that this institution should be kept as an educational facility.&nbsp; Please be assured that I will continue to work with Senator LaValle to address this issue.   Once again, thank you for taking the time to write and share your concerns with me. If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to contact me.   Sincerely,  Caesar Trunzo  Senator&nbsp;

       My family hails from Shelter Island and for almost three years I served as a member of the administration of Southampton College as Director of Housing & Residence Life.  During this time I was a member of the 'President's Council' which was the senior administrative group at the college under president Don Wilson. Prior to assuming the position at Southampton, I held professional staff positions at the State University of New York and at Alfred University, both in Alfred, NY, while earning my undergraduate and graduate degrees from Alfred University.  I share this as it gave me a perspective on how three different higher educational institutions operated.  I can without a doubt state that Southampton was one administrative mess.  I am truly amazed it took LIU as long as it has to try and 'escape' from the money pit the college has been for them .... not that it should or had to be that way.   On July 13, I took a day off from my day job to visit both Shelter Island (where my family has our roots) and the college I called home (literally as I lived in Bridgehampton's basement apartment for two years).  That apartment was where my spouse and I called our first home too!     As I reflect back on my years at Southampton the following thoughts come to mind:    1. MIS-MANAGEMENT  - I wish I could say I was part of the solution and not the problem, but I quit in disgust.  The administration and the multiple unions are part of the reason for possible demise of the college.  Years after leaving the college, I was still fond of telling a story I called the 'Southampton Screwjob'.  Before my arrival on campus someone selected a new wall light for the dorm rooms that utilized a theft resistant screw to lock the (Tupperware white) globe to the wall unit.  To change a light bulb required three work orders: One to the engineers to remove the screw, a second to change the bulb, and a third to replace the screw.  In truth it was three parts of one work order, but the two unions involved (engineers and custodial workers) would not work together and the engineers would not allow the custodians to use a screwdriver necessitating three visits to the dorm room to complete a light bulb change.  This is a true story, the end result was by the time I left the college all the globes were in some state of disrepair as our students unable to remove the theft resistant screws would rightfully take matters into their own hands.  This situation was true to many ways in which things worked 'differently' at Southampton.    2. LONG DISTANCE MANAGEMENT  - Long before distance learning was in vogue, 'distance management' was the way of the world.  Back then, the each of the college's had a 'president' and the big cheese (now called the president) was the chancellor of the university system.  Don Wilson was president during my tenure at the college and tried to run the college, but the chancellor and his staff were intent on controlling the place.  They even had a 'Dean of Administration' (Joe Carbone) who reported directly to LIU Headquarters.  Poor Don Wilson, had to ask Joe for permission to do anything that cost a penny.  Don Wilson had a vision, and whether one agreed with it or not, he was never empowered to lead Southampton.  (One shining star while I was at Southampton was Tim Bishop.  I am sure he walked this tightrope as best he could as Provost. In many respects he was a visionary even back then when he was, I believe, the director of financial aid.)    3. DIFFERENT MISSIONS  - Faculty, administration and students did not share a common understanding of a long term plan for the college.   So ... how does Southampton College continue into the future:    A.  The alumni, students, faculty, and loyal local administration should band together to continue Southampton as a private college focusing on it's strengths in marine science and liberal studies.  (I was attracted to work at Southampton as I felt the environment would be similar to Alfred University which has a rich tradition of liberal arts, ceramic art and ceramic sciences ... more on that to follow.)    B.  Contact every state legislator, the governor, the Chancellor and Board of the SUNY system to establish a 'Statutory College (or School) at Southampton College' specializing in Marine Sciences.  The program has the reputation to win this status and financial support.  Such a designation will: 1) Provide capital to improve and maintain the facilities of the marine science program; 2.) Provide credibility to the college in general; 3.) Possibly provide short term capital funds to improve the campus.    C.  Eliminate Unions - if everyone truly wants to see Southampton continue it can be done without Unions.  Concessions will need to be made on compensation at all levels.  But one way to pay the greatest net earnings to the dedicated professionals who will make the college continue is to eliminate the percentage the union takes away from the college.    D.  Lease out the dormitory system to a professional management company, but only if they can guarantee the college a net operating income that exceeds the net profit (if any) the dorms generate today.  Having personal knowledge of the quality of these facilities (and they look like they haven't changed in twenty years) I would probably think they could be torn down and replaced with new and attractive apartment residences for students.    E.  Consider adopting a 'residential college' concept where faculty live on campus in significant numbers and interact with the student body as in a living and learning environment.  This could be one of the single biggest attractions to the school for prospective students, i.e.: knowing they will have significant contact with their professors both inside and outside the formal classroom.    F.  Seek legislation to allow the college to run the housing facilities on a for profit basis from Memorial Day to Labor Day each year. When I worked at the college we offered what I called 'continuing education' classes that were notoriously non-attended and we ran a Jitney (van) to the beach everyday.  Most of these 'students' were solely there for cheap rooms ($7 per night in 1981) and a way to enjoy the beach.  Well guess what ... rather than hide behind the 'non-profit' status, seek legal authority to run all or part of these facilities as motel rooms at a fair rate that would really contribute to keeping the college in the black.  (The rates today for August 2nd, one night in Southampton listed on Orbitz range from $190 to $260 for a one night stay.  People would pay $100 per bedroom per night for a properly outfitted suite of three bedrooms, i.e.: $300 per night!)   I live in Texas now and am too far away to help Southampton survive into the future, but the college will be in my thoughts and prayers in the year ahead.  Good Luck in all your endeavors!    Ken Thompson

          urlLink  Group pleads on land use     By Michael Rothfeld   In a show of political force, a bipartisan band of East End elected officials Thursday declared that the Southampton College campus "must" be preserved for educational purposes and not sold off for residential development.  Long Island University, the college's parent organization, announced in June that it would move the school's undergraduate programs to its C.W. Post Campus in Brookville in the fall of 2005 because the Southampton campus had lost $65 million since it opened in 1963.  On July 19, a committee of university trustees began exploring the fate of the 110-acre campus, which is zoned for residential development. The university plans to announce its intentions after the trustees meet in October.  "The elected officials are unified that the campus must, and I underline the word 'must,' remain an educational campus," said State Sen. Kenneth LaValle (R-Port Jefferson), chairman of the Senate's committee on higher education.  The others who gathered at Southampton Town Hall included Assemb. Fred Thiele (R-Sag Harbor) and Republican Southampton Supervisor Patrick Heaney, both alumni of the college; U.S. Rep. Tim Bishop (D-Southampton), the college's former provost; Suffolk Legis. Jay Schneiderman (R-Montauk); and Kevin Law, chief deputy to Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy, a Democrat.  Long Island University officials have already held discussions with representatives of the state university system and Suffolk County Community College. LaValle called talks between LIU and the state "productive, positive and ongoing."  The elected officials Thursday appeared optimistic about a possible deal with the state, particularly about a merger between Southampton's undergraduate marine sciences program and a similar graduate program at the state's Stony Brook University.  "At state university tuition, Southampton College becomes an incredibly attractive educational alternative," Bishop said.  A university spokeswoman, Paola Curcio-Kleinman, declined to comment. In a statement released by LIU on July 29, board chairman Roger Tilles said the committee dealing with the campus "stated its clear preference to preserve the 110-acre site, if at all possible, for educational, cultural and not-for-profit services."  Tilles, who did not return calls Thursday, previously said the trustees had "a fiduciary responsibility" to recoup some of the money the college had lost over the years through a sale of the land and they wanted to determine its "highest and best use."  James C. Barnett Jr., a Huntington appraiser, said that means the most profitable viable use.  "Highest and best use is for residential development -- that's the most gorgeous piece of property," Barnett said.  But Southampton College Chancellor Robert F.X. Sillerman suggested an educational use might be more economical because a new academic building and library wouldn't have to be torn down. In any case, he said, LIU is "under no obligation to take the highest price."  Copyright (c) 2004, Newsday, Inc. August 6, 2004

         urlLink  Suffolk politicians trying to keep Southampton College for education use       urlLink    Watch the Video     Some Suffolk politicians are urging administrators at Long Island University to keep the Southampton campus for educational use.  A supervisor, a legislator, a senator and a congressman all say they have ideas and influence to keep Southampton College going after the undergraduate program moves to Old Brookville in September 2005. Officials say the campus is zoned for residential use with a special exception for education. Southampton’s town supervisor says things could get complicated if LIU decides to try and sell the land for development.  LIU released a statement in which the chair of the board of trustees said there is a “clear preference to preserve the 110-acre site if at all possible for education, cultural and not-for-profit services. However, it is incumbent upon the Board to explore all options.”  No final decision will be made about the fate of Southampton College until the board of trustees of LIU meets in October.  ************************   WHEN  and  WHERE  in October will the Board of Trustees be meeting?? I feel a protest coming on...

            urlLink   A Human Face          The Personal Consequences of the Closing of Southampton College    By David Stoll   Much has been written about what will happen to the campus of Southampton College and its unique programs after it closes in the summer of 2005. These are very important issues, but they represent only part of the story. This report spotlights the human equation. The closing of Southampton College will affect individuals of all stripes in a broad variety of ways, all unhappy. And Southampton College cannot fix these problems, as the problems were engendered by the very way that the closing was handled. Here are some of the groups of people who find themselves in impossible situations. These are real people whose stories were told and confirmed during the research of this article. We believe it is accurate.  First, though, it is important to make the following point. Long Island University’s C. W. Post campus has much to offer, both in terms of facilities and programs. (Indeed, some have questioned how Southampton College can be such a drain on the LIU system given that the C. W. Post campus receives so much more money.) When comments are made in this story about people not wanting to attend C. W. Post, it is not meant as a criticism of C. W. Post, but merely an acknowledgement that different people have different interests and desires. Someone who wants to live in Southampton—a small town during the off-season and a resort area during the summer—may not wish to live in one of New York City’s suburbs, or its boroughs. (Brookville is a mere 40 miles from NYC, and LIU has a Brooklyn campus too.) Likewise, others came to Southampton College for the Marine Sciences program or the ability to attend the Writers Conference each summer. Let’s face it: whatever C. W. Post may offer, lectures by Jules Feifer and Roger Rosenblatt will not be part of the curriculum.  Class of ’08 Scholarships. The Southampton College Class of 2008 will come in September. Many of those students have scholarships. When they agreed in April to come here, they turned down scholarships at other colleges. Now they have only two choices: to spend a year at a college as it disappears and then transfer to another college, hoping to obtain another scholarship, or to go to LIU’s C. W. Post campus. These students and parents are devastated, as the students do not wish to go to C. W. Post. They enrolled at Southampton College for a reason.  Librarians. Southampton College has three tenured librarians. Tenured faculty cannot be fired, but these librarians have been told that there are no jobs for them at C. W. Post. Instead, they will be offered jobs at LIU’s Brooklyn campus. With no disrespect to that institution, the Southampton College librarians did not celebrate when told they must now work in a major City at a campus with an entirely different academic program.  Scholarship Athletes. There are a number of athletes now at Southampton College, a Division 2 school, who are on scholarship. While they have been assured that they will keep their athletic scholarships at C. W. Post, they have been informed that there is likely not to be space for them on C. W. Post’s sports teams. These are not people who are looking for a free ride. These are talented kids who love sports and are willing to devote substantial time to trying to achieve victories for their college. They have been benched.  Tenured Faculty. The faculty has been reminded that tenure is granted by LIU, not Southampton College. That means that, just like the librarians, the academic faculty can be sent to C. W. Post or Brooklyn, and many faculty members are hearing whispers that they will be sent to Brooklyn. Thus, their choice is (1) to commute over 65 miles to C. W. Post or over 100 miles to Brooklyn, (2) to move from the East End to New York City or its suburbs, or (3) to look for a new job. Some choice for someone who has chosen to make a life on the East End.  It has been rumored that the plan to close Southampton College has been in the works (quite secretly) for some time. LIU professors are unionized and command higher salaries than many of their counterparts at other colleges. People have remarked that the College has not replaced retiring professors in various disciplines. Indeed, the Political Science department has shrunk from a high of nine professors to a mere two today. Thus, there is a feeling that the closing of Southampton College and the whispers of sending people to Brooklyn are tactics to encourage resignations and early retirements. This article does not confirm or refute conspiracy theories, but it is a fact that many faculty are looking for jobs at colleges that offer an environment similar to that at Southampton College rather than move to Brooklyn or even C. W. Post.  Local Students. Quite a number of students at Southampton College grew up on the East End and live with their parents while in school. These students cannot afford student housing—even subsidized student housing. They will have no choice but to drive over 65 miles to C. W. Post (or even nearly 100 miles to Brooklyn).  Low-wage Workers. Southampton College is the largest employer on the East End, and many of the employees are low-wage workers, without tenure, such as groundskeepers, janitors, cafeteria workers and secretaries. Once their jobs disappear, there surely will be insufficient new jobs on the East End for all these people. Thus, if they are “lucky” enough to be offered jobs at C. W. Post or Brooklyn, they will be left with the choice to commute, or else to uproot their families and move. For the working poor, this is plainly a Hobson’s choice.  Student Housing. Those Southampton College students who elect to go to C. W. Post will be housed at an “adjacent campus,” according to official statements. What this means, it turns out, is a SUNY campus in Old Westbury, and students apparently will be transported to LIU by bus. Thus, students who came to Southampton College for a familial atmosphere and in some cases for the ability to walk from home to school now must be segregated from the rest of the student body and instead live among students at a completely different institution. These students feel as though they will have fallen from the status of favored child to that of unloved step-child. To make matters worse, Old Westbury has a reputation (whether or not deserved) for crime problems.  Recruiting. The official story is that Southampton College, with its own programs, will continue to exist at C. W. Post; only the location will have changed. However, it was announced at the end of last week that the Director of Admissions of Southampton College is being transferred immediately to C. W. Post, leaving Southampton College without an admissions director to recruit the high school class of 2004. Moreover, the recruiting department has been instructed not to print brochures or otherwise to undertake efforts to bring students to Southampton College (wherever it is located). The feeling is that the institution is being left to die.  Incoming Juniors. As the closing of Southampton College was announced only recently, many students about to enter their junior year in September will be unable to transfer to another college this year. They will study hard this year and apply to transfer for the fall of 2005. The problem is that an enormous number of colleges and universities will not accept more than two years of academic credits for its incoming transfer students. So, the juniors this year not only are unable to graduate from a school at which they will have spent three years, but they will not even be able to graduate in May 2006.  Transfer Students. There is at least one person who was to have transferred to Southampton College from another college effective this September. She has been told not to do so, but has been offered a place at C. W. Post where she has not interest in attending.  * * *  The purpose of this story is to associate human faces with the decision to close Southampton College. The closing of Southampton College would be a blow to the East End as a unique place however accomplished, but it is also important to realize that the particular problems described above are caused not just by the closing but by the way the closing was handled. Indeed, it is said that the Trustees of LIU originally voted to close Southampton College as of August 2004, but were then asked to consider the chaos that would ensue. Their response was to delay the closing for a mere year. That is simply not enough time to prevent so many sad consequences to so many innocent people. And to add insult to injury, the decision was announced in the summer during the U. S. Open, when so many students and local residents were away or in hiding. That is simply disrespectful.

       To All Alumni  At the request of the Alumni Board I have been coordinating our efforts regarding the announcement by LIU to relocate the undergraduate program at Southampton College. This has not been an easy task given the sheer number of alum's and how dispersed we are. For this and prior documents I have tried to capture the prevailing views and to focus on critical items only. Staying focused has been the priority. This document fulfills the obligation I signed on for and it is time to pass the responsibility on to another alum. This person should have relevant leadership experience and be prepared to dedicate the time. Those interested should express their interest to me ( urlLink mrobert168@aol.com ) and Greg Connly, President of the Alumni Board ( urlLink gconnly@dolanconnly.com ).  In closing I wish to express my thanks to all the alumni for the discipline and maturity in which they have addressed this issue. I wish to thank Carol Gilbert for her support and balance during a very difficult period. I thank Mickey Director and Peter Philipps for the contributions they have made at our meeting on July 7. Likewise, thank you Matt, Alan, Louis, Pete, Larry and the many others that took the time to provide input. Finally a big hug and thank you to Joan Tutt whose heart and soul keeps us all motivated and moving forward.  Bob Martin        Southampton College Future Update July 29, 2004        Update:     Based on a three hour meeting with the LIU leadership on July 7th, 2004, the Southampton College alumni rejected the notion that the closing of the school was attributed to its location, purported alumni and community disinterest, and the inability of faculty to develop successful programs. The Southampton alumni, based on the limited information provided by the University, maintained that the fundamental cause of the college’s problems could be attributed to decades of apparent mismanagement by the Long Island University leadership. As of now nothing has been provided that would suggest that we should reverse this position.  It was also the view of the alumni that the LIU Leadership did not vigorously pursue alternative operating models that would maintain the undergraduate program at Southampton College. It is now apparent that during the time leading up to their decision they did not pursue negotiations with various Universities to maintain the undergraduate program. However we are told that this will change going forward. They have recently stated that their primary goal now is to preserve the current site of Southampton College for educational and cultural purposes. It appears that they seriously underestimated the backlash from the various stakeholders. They now recognize that the sale of the land for residential or commercial development is not their best option. They have appointed a Special Committee, co-chaired by John Kanas (class of 68 and a member of the Board of Trustees), to identify and pursue appropriate candidates and to lead the negotiations. Discussions are in progress with at least two institutions.  We recommended to the leadership of LIU at the July 7th meeting that they work side by side with the alums and other stakeholders to revisit their plan and to explore alternatives. As of now, the LIU leadership has not accepted our offer to work together. The Board of Overseers of Southampton College has recently made a similar offer to the LIU leadership. The Board of Overseers consists of individuals whose primary interest is the welfare of Southampton College. The members include alums, significant contributors, educators and some members of the LIU Board of Trustees.  We requested at the July 7th meeting that they agree that their decision to relocate the current undergraduate program is revocable. They have confirmed that their decision is irrevocable.      What Next:     While the alumni and other stakeholders have good reason to request a thorough review by the NY State Board of Regents, it may not be the appropriate action to take at this time. Our primary objective should be to ensure that an acceptable undergraduate program is provided at this campus and that the name Southampton College is preserved. With this as an objective our efforts will be better served by supporting the Special Committee’s effort to negotiate the sale of the Southampton College campus to another institution. Given the track record of the LIU leadership and the LIU Board of Trustees, this strategy contains an element of risk that is sure to make us all uncomfortable. It is therefore imperative that we monitor their progress and be prepared with alternative positions in the event that this strategy fails to satisfy our objectives.      Supporting the Special Committee:     As a first step, and until we are better organized, we will advise the Committee chair that we will support the Special Committee’s effort. The most important role we can play is to proactively promote the Southampton location in the most favorable way - one that welcomes institutions of higher education and that provides a favorable and friendly operating environment. The tone has to be positive by all. Elected Officials, special interest groups and others should not try and capitalize on the college’s failure. Public positioning to further and individual or groups own interests will only risk negotiations with other institutions and jeopardize our goal of maintaining a Southampton campus.            Alternative Positions:     In the event that our objective is not achieved we need to be prepared on a number of fronts:   1.  Privatization of the school has been ruled out for now because of cost and the time it would take to obtain accreditation. If that became the last option however, we would need to have an education model that was financially viable. One that would attract students and endowments.  2.  Recourse options need to be identified. This should be limited to a select few and maintained confidential. Publicity at this stage would only jeopardize the Special Committee’s effort to negotiate and put at risk our objective.  3.  Funding to explore alternative positions is required.  4.  We need to be organized.      Getting Organized:     First we need to select an individual to lead the alumni. Bob Martin agreed to lead phase one which was our meeting with the LIU leadership. We now need someone to lead the next phase as identified above. All interested candidates should forward their qualifications to Greg Connly, President of the Alumni Association.  Second, the leadership of each stakeholder group needs to meet and agree on objectives and strategies. The faculty has appointed Scott Carlin to chair their effort. Bob Sillerman chairs the Southampton College Board of Overseers. We are not aware if the business community, residential community or elected officials have organized in a similar fashion. The Board of Overseers (Bob Sillerman) should take the lead of this initiative by coordinating the stakeholders on the following:   1.  Define expectations - communicate to the Special Committee the required outcomes from the sale of the campus to an appropriate university. This should be limited to three or four points and it should not be a laundry list.  2.  Communicate to the Special Committee the support of all stakeholders subject to their agreement to our outcomes as well as their agreement to keep the Board of Overseers abreast of their effort.  3.  The Board of Overseers will keep the leader of each stakeholder group informed of progress and issues. Given the nature of negotiations, a high degree of confidentiality will need to be maintained by all.  4.  Conducting a public relations campaign that positively positions Southampton as an ideal location a college campus.  Third, the alternative positions should be organized into two groups: Privatization and Recourse.   1.  Privatization should include members from each of the stakeholder groups. The output from this initiative is alternative education models that are financially viable. Each model must be highly marketable to potential students and financial supporters from the community. This effort should be co-chaired by someone from the faculty and someone from the community. Harry Marmion is uniquely positioned to pull this together and act as an advisor going forward.  2.  Recourse should include an attorney from each of the stakeholders, with the exception of the Board of Overseers. The exclusion of the Board of Overseers is to avoid a potential conflict of interest for those members who are also on the Board of Trustees. This group should be small and Michael Director will co-chair this initiative. Attorneys and CPA’s who want to help should email their interest and background to Michael Director ( urlLink directorlaw@optinonline.net ).      Funding:     We will require funding to finance:   1.  A PR campaign that continues to build widespread support for our effort.  2.  The costs incurred to prepare “alternative options” as defined above.  3.  Privatization as a last resort.  Funding requirements and strategies for the first two initiatives will be different from the third initiative. The first two initiatives will require an estimated $30,000. This is a very rough estimate and could increase as we learn more. Our target audience is all stakeholders. Our strategy here is to raise small contributions via widespread support. Selling T shirts, alumni donations, raffles etc. are examples of tactics we would deploy. From the alum side, Joan Tutt will lead this effort. The other stakeholders need to appoint someone. We will need to establish ourselves as a nonprofit organization.  The third initiative is to raise at least $100 million. Before we can start soliciting candidates who are in a position to contribute at a significant level we need a product to market. Once we have a financially viable model we can start to solicit interest. In the interim we can identify prospects and develop a strategy to approach each candidate. At this point it appears that the Board of Overseers is best positioned to lead that effort.      Summary:     Since our meeting on July 7th, the LIU leadership has adjusted their position somewhat. Subject to their agreement to our expected outcomes, we will support their new position. In the event that they do not deliver on these outcomes, we will be prepared to take action with alternative positions that will achieve our objectives and hold the LIU leadership accountable. In the interim, all stakeholders need to take a public position that reflects positively on Southampton as a location for higher education.

        urlLink July 23, 2004, Newsday    Can college go forward?   Is it time to write Southampton College's obituary? Or is the college undergoing a transformation that will allow it to go forward in a new form with a renewed spirit ["The little college that couldn't," News, July 18]?  I'm a Southampton College adjunct professor who teaches a course titled "Environmental Ethics: Western & Indigenous World Views." In class, we've learned how different cultures value land. Our culture values property as a resource from which to earn a profit. But indigenous cultures believe humans should seek union with the land's spirit to gain insight concerning its proper use.  As a former city planner, I'm familiar with the planning principle that land should be put to its "highest and best use." The best use of property is that which expresses the highest spiritual value of a culture. Can the human spirit and spirit of the land that this college rests on be joined so that an undergraduate college continues? I believe it's possible. The real question is: Are we up to the task?   Peter Maniscalco     urlLink July 29, 2004, The Southampton Press   (just links to articles - you will need an online subscription to view them)    When Southampton College holds its commencement next May, the Class of 2005 will be joined by one graduate with a unique perspective.   urlLink Go to article.

By Dan Rattiner    This is a little behind the scenes stuff. In our edition last week, I wrote an article about Southampton College, in which I said that the owner of the college, Long Island University, was pledging to never allow the 100-acre campus upon which the school sits to be used for anything else but educational purposes. And this was a very good thing. As you know, two weeks earlier, LIU announced that the college will close in September 2005.   Perhaps you noticed that no other newspaper wrote anything about this pledge. Dan’s Papers had the story. It wasn’t in Newsday, the New York Times or any of the local weeklies. How come? Did we make it up?   We did not make it up. Nor did we get it wrong. But we do want to apologize, sort of. Or write a correction, slightly.   The sequence of events was this.   On Monday morning (11 days ago), the LIU Board met privately to discuss Southampton College. Dan’s Papers had no idea what was said at this meeting.   But Dan’s Papers does know what two members of that Board said when they met with the Southampton College Overseers later that same day. The Overseers, I hasten to say, have no power or authority whatsoever. They are a group of men and women who ought to have some control, but who are told politely by the Board that they are “advisors,” as in, advise us on what you think. What some of the Overseers thought, in the absence of anyone telling them what they were being told was top secret, was that if Dan’s Papers called them they would let the paper know what the LIU Board members told them.   According to the Overseers, the two LIU Board members told the Overseers what was decided by the LIU Board earlier in the day. My information came from two different Overseers. What they both said was that the LIU Board members told them that 1. the LIU Board was making a commitment to never sell the campus for residential and commercial use, but always keep it for educational use, 2. they were irrevocably in agreement that the school would be closed in September 2005, 3. they would immediately open negotiations to sell 10 acres to the Parrish Art Museum, and 4. they would form a search committee to seek offers to continue providing an educational experience on the site, 5. They would issue a press release on Wednesday to the effect of what was said in number 1 - 4.   Based on this information, Dan’s Papers published a heads up on what the LIU Board members said was decided at the morning meeting. We trusted that the Board would never mislead or lie to the Overseers and we continue to believe that is true.   We went to press on Tuesday night. On Wednesday morning, Dan’s Papers edition was on the press being printed for Thursday and Friday distribution. We were committed.   No press release came out on Wednesday. One did come out on Thursday afternoon, and it mentioned the commitment to proceed in closing the school and it mentioned the formation of the search committee, but it only used such phrases as “our best effort” and “our hope” that the land should continue to be an educational institution. There was no mention about selling anything to the Parrish.   What happened?   Well, I really don’t know. I did ask several LIU Board members about the discrepancy, because I know them, but I was told they could tell me nothing as they had made a blood oath to never reveal what was said that Monday morning. Of course, the Overseers had made no similar oath.   “What if I ask you something and you just stamp once for yes and twice for no?” I tried.   Nothing doing.   And so, here is my speculation on the matter. I believe that the LIU Board DID make the commitment never to sell the property for commercial or residential use, but between Monday and Wednesday it had to go through the filter of $400-an-hour lawyers. And so what started out as a thunderbolt came out as a little poop, even though there was no follow-up board meeting to say it differently.   Here is what I think the lawyers said. “You agreed on WHAT? You put that in writing, it will probably cost you thirty million dollars down the road. Just ten words. Thirty million dollars.”   Their hearts are still in the right place. There are more meetings coming up this week. Time is short. Shoot the lawyers.   * * *  Here’s the latest news about the college: there isn’t any. Meetings are going on all over the place. Everybody’s sworn to secrecy. My job is to let readers know what is going on. It’s an honorable profession. I wish I had something.    urlLink July 31, 2004, Newsday    Let's save this college   I am an adjunct professor of advertising and business at LIU Southampton and several other schools on Long Island and would like to say it is terrible what is happening to Southampton College ["The little college that couldn't," News, July 18].  I truly hope that as a community we can stop the closing and stop all these vulture developers from closing our college and taking its beautiful land. For 43 years this college has been a source of culture, education, intellect and training for many eastern Long Islanders. It also supports the local economy. Without it, the local ecomony will be adversely affected due to higher unemployment and lack of disposable income to support local businesses.  About 400 people would lose their jobs. If our government and our local corporations sit idly by and allow this to occur, it will be a shame. If there are any kind corporations who would be willing to save this beautiful college, the college and the local community would be eternally grateful.    Réagan Lorraine Lavorata     urlLink August 4, 2004 The Independents    Growing Outrage Over College Closure   By Carey London   With the impending closure of Southampton College’s undergraduate program looming on the horizon, an alarmed community gathered to speak on the issue with elected officials, college professors, students and alumni Sunday evening. The forum preceded a press conference to be held tomorrow at Southampton Town Hall at 10 a.m. featuring New York State Senator Kenneth LaValle, Congressman Tim Bishop, County Executive Steve Levy, and Assemblyman Fred Thiele.   A handful of panelists, along with Southampton Professor Scott Carlin as moderator, spoke of the intention not only to keep the Southampton campus an educational institution, but to maintain a four-year program as well. The land, they said collectively, will not fall prey to developers eager to conquer and divide what is considered to be some of the most valuable property in Suffolk County.   “I was very distressed when I first heard,” said Suffolk County Legislator Jay Schneiderman of the school’s closure, adding that the 110-acre campus is a “prime piece of real estate.” Schneiderman entertained the idea of collaborating with Suffolk County Community College, in Riverhead, but “ideally that wasn’t the best solution.” Following Levy’s vetoes to the county budget earlier this summer, Schneiderman re-established an authorization to spend $30 million on the Riverhead campus, much to the chagrin of some residents who felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere, such as at Southampton College. The SUNY system would be a better option, Schneiderman continued, because it would keep the facility a four-year educational institution. Levy could not attend the forum, but Ben Zwirn, his Assistant Deputy County Executive, did. Zwirn, whose son attends the college, said that he does not want to see the programs disbanded, especially the prestigious marine science program, whose fate has yet to be decided.   Considered to be one of the best in the country, the marine science program’s success is in large part due to the college’s surroundings. Because of Southampton’s on-campus marine station on Shinnecock Bay, students have unlimited access to bays, tidal creeks, barrier beaches, dunes, salt marshes, salt ponds and the ocean.  “This school should be a star in the LIU system,” Zwirn proclaimed.    The Shinnecock   The forum provided a first for the Shinnecock Indian Nation, who, they said, had yet to be included in the decision-making process either publicly or privately. Tribal members Elizabeth Haile and Lance Gumbs joined the panelists. For Haile, Southampton College represents the opportunities not available to her as a young woman. In 1948, she enrolled in the Oneonta State Teachers College because there was “no such school on Long Island,” she said, citing long bus trips and a lot of time away from home. “If there had been a Southampton College I could have walked to school, lived at home…” And now, “it looks to me like we’re about to go backwards in time about 50 years,” said Haile, who is also a Southampton College Doctor of Humane Letters. “This issue is most serious. Time is of the essence.”   And in what some believed to be an attempt to advance personal politics, Shinnecock Tribal Chairman Lance Gumbs spoke of the potential benefits to having an Indian Gaming facility on Shinnecock land, stating that some of the proceeds would go to funding the institution. The college, said Gumbs, has given a tremendous amount to the tribe and “it’s time now that the Shinnecock Indian Nation give back.”  He also spoke of “working together” with local politicians who have up until this point failed to include the Shinnecock in any of the brainstorming discussions about the college. The school is the largest source of employment for the tribe, said Gumbs, adding that losing this institution would be a devastating blow not only to the surrounding community, but also to the Shinnecock as well.    Irreplaceable History   A current student and a recent graduate also joined the panel. Nora Detweiler, a 30-something student, choked up at the thought of the school closing. And Sharon Wallen, an alumna and a pre-school teacher, remarked on the incredible “impact” four years can have on a person, adding later that, “the love, dedication and history cannot just be replaced,” she said. “Please give others the opportunity that I was so lucky and blessed to have.”   Tim Bishop, a former Southampton College Provost, was the final panelist to speak prior to public commentary. “The most important thing for us to do is focus on where we go from here,” he said. Although the discussions regarding the future of the school have been “collegial, productive and positive,” there is no concrete deal in the works with SUNY Stony Brook, as erroneously reported in one of the local newspapers, said Bishop. “The article was premature,” he continued, adding that they are “not yet at that point.” In fact, in response to the article, Long Island University released a statement reaffirming the ambiguity of the college’s future.  Once the roster of speakers concluded their position statements, the floor was opened to public debate.   Most audience members took liberty with their relegated three-minute time slot, opining on the state of affairs and offering suggestions to save the college. Changing the current zoning codes for the campus was one well-received idea. Currently zoned R-60, or residential, the property could be altered to a specific zone for higher education, thereby eliminating the risk of subdivision. Others agreed that politicians should include the Shinnecock in any decisions made for the school, commending Gumbs for his forthright speech.   Southampton Professor Helen Mendez said that this forum was the first time in weeks that she had felt any kind of hope of protecting the college from falling to the “corporate Godzillas that are circling around us…You know what a jewel we have here,” she said.    Closing The Doors   Slated to close its undergraduate doors in May 2005, Southampton College will move affected students to the LIU CW Post campus in Brookville. Citing fiduciary responsibilities, the university has insisted that this is the most viable opportunity for reimbursing a $77 million debt accrued by the college, $17.2 million of which was accumulated in just the last three years.   But many are now asking for whom does the educational bell toll? Some have said it tolls for the 365 full-time employees who work at Southampton College. Others believe it tolls for the 1,196 undergraduate students currently enrolled and soon to be displaced. And still more have said the bell tolls for the residents who have relied on the school to stand fast as one of the three pillars in this bustling community. The other two, Southampton Hospital and the Parrish Art Museum, are also experiencing financial distress — the latter having recently finalized a deal with the school to build a facility on the campus.   Gumbs noted that regardless of having a unique campus situated in one of the country’s most affluent areas, LIU is still looking at closing this institution.  Dr. Avram Morrell, a United States Army Veteran of the Korean War and a graduate of LIU in Brooklyn in 1953, summed up the mood of the crowd. There are “jewels and diamonds in the rough, such as this college,” he said of the Southampton school. “This is a shame...The university must stop cannibalizing this campus.”     urlLink August 5, 2004, The Southampton Press   (just links to articles - you will need an online subscription to view them)    A deal between Long Island University and the State University of New York to bring SUNY Stony Brook students to the Southampton College campus is unlikely to be announced at a press conference scheduled for this morning in front of Southampton Town Hall, officials said this week.   urlLink Go to article.

         urlLink   Officials Unite To Save College          By Kathryn Georgette   During a press conference last Thursday at Southampton Town Hall, attended by nearly 30 people, Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, Congressman Timothy Bishop, Assemblyman Fred Thiele, County Legislator Jay Schneiderman, Southampton Town Supervisor Patrick Heaney, and a representative from County Executive Steve Levy’s office announced that they will unite under the effort to "maintain an educational presence" at the Southampton campus of Long Island University.  Further, they announced the goal of not only maintaining the campus as an educational site, but as a four-year undergraduate college. "We are united behind the goal that a four-year college remains at the Southampton College," said Thiele. Long Island University’s Board of Trustees announced on June 15 that Southampton College’s undergraduate programs would be relocated to the C.W. Post and Brooklyn branches of the University effective as of September 2005, due to the campus’s projected $77 million cumulative debt.  Students and alumni of the college, who are fearful that the residentially zoned 110-acre campus will be razed and developed for real estate sale, have met the impending closure with protests. Despite fears that the college’s Board of Trustees would lean towards a profitable real estate venture, Bishop said he is "convinced that [keeping the campus as an educational facility] remains their interest as well. I believe the board will be determined to not subdivide, as feared."  Bishop acknowledged that "technically, we have no power [over a real estate sale]." Thiele commented that Southampton town is willing "to undertake our own study of the uses of the property," and "make recommendations on its highest and best uses."  On-Going Talks LIU has been in talks with officials in the state university system and Suffolk County Community College. Still, no agreements have been made, and discussions are "on-going," according to Senator LaValle, who is also the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Higher Education. A hot topic at the meeting was a partnership between the Stony Brook University marine science graduate program and Southampton’s undergraduate program. "There is a natural fit, a natural synergy between the two programs," commented Bishop.  The appeal for Stony Brook would come from "the melding of a great undergraduate program with a graduate program in one of the most desirable, beautiful places in world, Southampton," LaValle opined.  "At state university tuition, Southampton College becomes an incredibly attractive educational alternative," said Bishop.  County Legislator Schneiderman offered that although the state university appears to have "the lead role" in negotiations, SCCC would provide an additional route for the college to take. SCCC is in need of athletic facilities, as well as library space, according to Schneiderman, which the Southampton College campus could provide.  "We will continue to discuss with LIU and our state partners how Suffolk County and our distinguished community college may play a role in keeping this site reserved for higher education," said County Executive Levy. "There may be a role for the county to play," Schneiderman continued. "But we don’t want to stand in the way [of a deal with the state]."  For many of these officials, this battle is both personal and professional. Bishop was the Provost for the college previous to his congressional campaign, and Supervisor Heaney and Assemblyman Thiele are both alumni.  "The importance of Southampton College to eastern Long Island must not be underestimated," said Thiele. "It’s not just the educational opportunities, the economic benefits, the jobs, and the cultural resources the college provides, but it is the opportunity the college has provided to so many individuals to fulfill their dreams."  Some in the audience wondered if only "the dreams" of marine science majors will be solved in this effort, due to the focus of the partnership with the Stony Brook Marine Science program during the press conference.  "There have been informal discussions about what would happen beyond that," said LaValle. "A lot of this is truly in the exploration stages, but as we explore, we will explore different synergies."  In regard to budget concerns, Thiele commented, "I don’t see the state budget standing in the way."  LIU trustees will not announce their decision regarding the campus until after their meeting in October.

        urlLink Newsday - August 10, 2004      C.W. Post sees burst in enrollment     By Olivia Winslow   Long Island University's C.W. Post Campus announced Monday that it will have its largest freshman class in 20 years when the semester starts next month, with 950 students, including significant numbers with strong academic credentials and an increase in students from Long Island and Queens.  "It's at least the largest class going back to 1984," when the freshman class numbered 1,034, said Gary Bergman, C.W. Post's associate provost for enrollment services. Bergman said freshman enrollment last year was 843 students. "Freshman enrollment has been laboring in the 800s since around 2000," Bergman said.  One factor not triggering the increase this year is LIU's controversial decision to relocate undergraduate programs from its Southampton College campus to C.W. Post in Brookville next year, a move prompted by Southampton's mounting deficit, officials have said.  "None of this increase here is from the Southampton campus," Bergman said. But Southampton has seen a drop in its incoming freshman class, likely caused by the relocation plan, Provost Dan Rodas said. "We're expecting about 170 freshmen," Rodas said. "Last year we were right around 200."  Bergman said the freshman enrollment surge at Post prompted the administration to cap it at 950 students and establish a waiting list. "We're trying to hold it to 950," Bergman said, citing the college's interest in maintaining small class sizes, which average 18 students, that are a hallmark of Post, which has about 4,800 undergraduate students.  This year's freshman enrollment represents a nearly 13 percent increase over last year. "We've had incredibly strong interest from students from Long Island," Bergman said. He said 360 of the new freshmen come from Nassau County, 230 from Suffolk County and just under 100 from Queens. Those numbers are up between 25 and 30 percent over last year, Bergman said.  Bergman also touted the high academic caliber of many of the students. While SAT averages are not yet available, Bergman said that among the more than 45 percent of incoming freshmen receiving academic scholarships from the college, "a lot of these students have 1200 and 1300 SATs and higher. They're the students that every college would love to have."  Bergman cited student interest in new degree programs, such as forensic science, which begins next month, popular programs such as teacher education, the recently-developed Access program that helps freshmen uncertain about a major to develop a field of study, and new facilities.

      My version of the Bush gay marriage speech....  (be sure to imagine the voice and the accent)  Hello America. My name is W. Some of you may know me as your president. It has come to my attention that gays are being allowed to marry in some of our rebel states. If we continue to allow this to happen, we will allow evil to spread through our great nation. We must defy our evil enemies. The current members of the axis of evil are gays, Muslims, and environmentalists. Don't let them corrupt you. If asked by a gay to get married, say "No!" and immediately go see the The Passion of Christ. Just remember, vote for me this Novemeber - oops, I mean don't marry gay.   DISCLAIMER: THE VIEWS EXPRESSED HEREIN ONLY REFLECT THE VIEWS OF OUR CURRENT WHITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, NOT THE RESIDENTS OF LAPPLAND.   Here in Lappland, we say allow gays the right to marry. Allow them the legal rights that the rest of us have. This nation has much bigger problems than gay marriage. Maybe we should focus our time and energy on other matters such as the economy and the war in Iraq. Maybe, and I know this is a big maybe, our current administration should stop allowing their religious beliefs interfere with what's best for our country.  Hmmm.... That's a not really new concept, is it?  After all, we have separation of church and state for a reason.

      Over the weekend, my martial arts school had a contest. I didn't win, but that's okay because there are so many good people in my class. I was just there for the experience. I got in a really good groin shot, and the crowd winced. The sound of my knuckles hitting my uke's cup vibrated over the pavement (the actual hit was planned, of course). It was cool. For a little while, I felt like a bad-ass. My friend Mary was also in the contest, and she did really well. She looks sweet, but she's really an ass-kicker! I also have a funny story. I have recently lost some weight, so now I'm able to fit into clothes at the slutty teenage girls' store (ever heard of Charlotte Russe?). Anyway, I bought a PVC S&M jacket that made me look like Trinity from the Matrix. It's really cool. So I'm thinking to myself, "I may not wear this in public much, but it sure will provide some good times at home." Well, when I got home, I put on the jacket for Matt and he couldn't stop laughing. Everytime I moved it crinkled, and with each crinkle I heard another laugh. He said that it looked like I was wearing a garbage bag. So much for sexy, right? Needless to say, I will return the jacket with my head down and my tail between my legs. I guess I'm getting too old for PVC.

      Today, the Mistress is having her carpet cleaned, therefore the children of evil are residing at Casa de Pablo. The stress began last night when we started moving things around in the apartment so that the cleaners would be able to get to more areas.  If you aren't familiar with cats, they don't like it when you change things. Then, they had to get their nails cut, have Advantage put on, and have their collars put on.  These were not fun times for the Mistress or her children. This morning, I had to catch them and put them in their carriers. At one point, I was on my knees holding a cat by the leg and tail as she squirmed to get under the bed. My partner in crime lunged over my head to grab her. Too funny! The worst part of all is that Rowan peed all over herself while she was inside her cat carrier. My scent for today is "Essence of Cat Piss." The Mistress and her chidren are not amused.

      The Mistress loves the Crystal Method. The Mistress saw the Crystal Method in concert Friday night with her trusty sidekick Mary.&nbsp; The Mistress highly recommends this experience to anyone, no E required.&nbsp; Apparently skeevy boys who wear 6 x 2 inch belt buckles that say "girl on top" like the Crystal Method too.&nbsp; And, has the Mistress ever mentioned how many pretty people there are here? It's frightening! Surprisingly enough, the Mistress has managed to move to the scariest place on earth....

      There's a reason why you can find the word ass in embarrassing.  Today, I was speaking with my boss about a project from a company called Domainex. I didn't miss a beat when I called the company Dominatrix. I turned bright red immediately.  At least she got a good laugh out of it.

      and by new, I mean new to me!  Prince - Musicology       I miss the days of arseless pants. Prince without sexuality...what is he thinking? At least he has a name again.  Anyway, it's still Prince.  He'll always be great.     Slipknot - Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses        "Is this CD good?" you ask. "Yes." says the Mistress.  "Does this CD rock as hard as Slipknot's other CDs?" you ask. "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!" says the Mistress.  It's like when Kiss took off their masks.  What were these boys thinking? Put your masks back on and kick some arse.     Black Eyed Peas - Elephunk        Makes the Mistress want to shake it like the whole earth's quakin'.     Superjoint Ritual - Lethal Dose of American Hatred and Use Once and Destroy        Phil got tired of singing and decided to start screaming.  This is very different from Pantera and Down, but I like it. It's edgy.       Fugazi - 13 Songs        Indie at it's best.     Lords of Acid - Farstucker       If you're really sad about Prince playing it straight, look no further. It's raunchy, and the pictures on the inside of this disk say it all. Lords of Acid = Total Sex Kittens (Me-ow! baby)         The Crystal Method - Legion of Boom        Tweekend's still my favorite.  This one's a little more trance than their previous CD's, but it's still good. The best way to hear it is live.     Marilyn Manson - Antichrist Superstar        (This one's not new at all really, it's just been revisited.) This CD rocks so hard that it exploded in our CD player. Marilyn should have taken Superjoint Ritual's name: Use Once and Destroy. Note to self...Marilyn Manson disks have a shelf life.

      Be sure to check out the reallycrazygirl.wmv at the Kiss My Monkey Ass site.  During the middle of the video, you'll find that they play "Every Song is a Death Metal Song" in Japan as well. Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

      Yes, the Mistress attended this very scary show.  Who knew there were so many skin-heads in LA. I've never seen so much "white pride" in my life.  And everyone thinks it's only in the south. Twisted! I'm a little bummed that Slipknot played on the 2nd stage.  The sound quality was bad, and there was so much dust that you couldn't see the stage.  The show on the main stage was cool.  Phil Anselmo is a talker!! I think he talked through half of Superjoint Ritual's set. I never thought that I would see Judas Priest and Black Sabbath reunited. Rob Halford's costumes reminded me a little bit of Mr. Slave on South Park ("Jesus Christ"). Ozzy was talking crazy as usual. Anyway, it was fun. Hopefully, they'll be in San Diego next year so that I don't have to drive out to the desert.
