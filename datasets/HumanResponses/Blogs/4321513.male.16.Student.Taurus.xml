      I hate expectations. Today, in first period, we played Jeopardy! (a cheap version that tests nothing, nor that expects the students to even hear the entire question) Anyway, last time around-we play before each test-I answered almost EVERY question for my team, thus earning all ten of us a +1 on our test. (I chose not to take the point, but oh well.)  So today, the same people who received points for the (continuous) raising of my hand last week, EXPECTED my to repeat. What they didn't know, the poor souls, was that I entered the classroom committed NOT to answer any questions. In fact, I was hoping to be the speaker so it would be obvious that I couldn't answer the questions.  But I failed. I wasn't speaker so I just sat and listened. My team, which since the teacher can't count had a 10-8 advantage in bodies, NEVER answered any questions. So what do they do when the score is 320 to ZERO? They snap at me. ME! Me who knew the answer to all of the questions that went right over their heads.  So I answered questions. A few at first, and more as the game continued. I botched one, but I must admit I don't give a damn. Ultimately, my team AND I brought the score up to 470-530. Then the teacher announced that he didn't think we were going to have time, so he didn't bother to offer a sixth category to choose from "Jacksonisism." (Yes, that IS supposed to be "Jacksonianism")  So after that we go into FINAL JEOPARDY! 650-670. The question involves treaties of the 1800's in America. Instead of consulting the team though, the TEAM sticks me with the pen and paper and has me right down the answer. I know it (The Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, and the Gadsen Purchase) but I toy with the idea of botching it, knowing that the other team will bid to win. I didn't, but wouldn't it have been fun?  So now, I failed myself. The day started out depressing and by first period was a crap shot.     I HATE EXPECTATIONS! THEY ARE THE DEVIL!     Additionally, in Earth Science, a 7th grade level science course mandated in NC high schools, I learned that in order to do well, I should forget everything I learned in my advanced classes-biology and chemistry-since "we don't care about orbitals everyday."  Not that it matters, I am listening to Oasis' "Wonderfall" and it's not bad.  Today was, without a doubt, a    gray    balloon...

      I have failed myself...again.  I succumbed to the pressures of my contemporaries and have created this-this monstrosity of which I had for so long been so adamantly opposed.  I have nothing intelligent to say, no deep thoughts, and no greater meaning.  I have failed!  I therefore doubt this will ever be updated, however I, at this moment in which I declare my hate for blogs, find myself rejecting food, a hobby, to type.  Shit, I've lost my mind!  This will, then, be for me. All poor souls who stumble upon this may be better off looking away- far, far, FAR away- deep into the shoes of the most isolated of clowns. It will be a study; a more independent view of myself. I may try my damnedest to be honest but since that is what I scope to learn I may struggle.  Again I say, If you have found this random, assorted, vile collage of thoughts, RUN!!! If you care to read on, do so, it obviously doesn't bother me.  Today, in case you want to know, my poor soul, would have been a    yellow    balloon...
