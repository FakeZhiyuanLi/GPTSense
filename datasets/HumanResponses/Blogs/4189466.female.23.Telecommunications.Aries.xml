      Last night was great! i didn't make it to the show at the mainzer, well i did, but i didn't stay.  i didn't really want to pay 8.00 to get in (plus rena only has 8.00 left so i didn't want her to have to leave).  i'm a little sad that i didn't go because people told me i would have loved it but not disapointed because rena and i stayed home and had fun.  andrew called us like three times and he was super drunk and i wanted to talk to him but rena was talking to crow from the mountain and he was cheering her up so i didn't want to make her get off.  so that's why we stayed online andrew.  i'm very sorry. but we did go to jennifer's dance party after i drank half a bottle of peppermint schnapps.  i mixed it with dr pepper because i really like to eat york peppermint patties and drink dp with it so i thought it would be a good combo...........it was but it was wierd cuz it was like a soda that clears out your nasal passages....... anyway, party was fuckin fantastic.  dancing in the garage to the BEST music ever.  huge mix of old to really old to new to really new.  i loved it so much, me and curtis were having the best time and he told me that he had hoped i would come.  i updated my photo blog with some of the pics so ch'check it out.

      so earlier today a few of us were riding in rena's car and talking about that huey lewis song, 'the heart of rock and roll' and rena's little brother nathan was singing "the heart of rock and roll is in cleveland" and rena and i started laughing and a big debate started about whether it was the "the heart of rock and roll is still beatin" or the prev one.  i was so surprised when jaysin knew the words and started singing (jaysin always surprises me with the stuff that he knows) and then we all started singing......it was fun and we were laughing super hard and i had to come home tonight and find out what it was.  and in case you were wondering, it is still beatin. so i was just reading thru the last two posts and i guess i was a lot drunker than i thought.  but i won't delete them cuz they're too funny.  i did have a wonderful time though and now i'm fully sober and just trying to outlast the full effect so i don't have hangover all day tomorrow. my feet are sore from dancing barefoot so i had to soak them.  but i truly had the most wonderful time and it was so great because rena was there to share it. oh, view my  urlLink photoblog  for more pictures.

      so i think i've sobred up enuf to write my story for the night it started with us rushing to get to show by 8.00, we get there and find it doesn't start til closer to nine.  that was ok, rena and i walked to get a soda, while there i see small bottles of peppermint schnapps for 4.00 and decide to buy one, procede to drink it on the walk back.  it burned and my lips were so knumb. rc played first with bryan.  everyone was sitting on the floor and and feelin the good music, i sang along just loud enough to not be obnoxious but i don't think anyone heard me. then a break where jason and i wnte out to renas car and drank more p.s. more numb lips, jason wanted to pucnh me but i was afrarid my teeth would fall out so i said no. came back to the billies and had so much fun dancing the night away.  its not the same as it used to be, cuz they play in the lobby now and have lost and replaced two members and are now just accoustic but there was me, rena, bryan and another small group of girls dancing.  all the girls were wearing skirts and twirling a lot and it felt so wonderful.  i could nto get the smile off my face. it was hot as the dickens in there though so the billies asked for a break and when they came back decided to play outside with no mics or anything and it was fabulous.  because the mainzer has the gate that blocks them from the street you can drink your beers outside so rc had this metal pail and was selling them.  andy laguna tried to kiss me and joey told me not to let him because he had liver lips.  liver lips!!!  so all the girls started dancing outside in thier barefeet as the billies played theri bluegrass and it felt like simple times.  it was so lovely. so i camehome drunk and happy, tried to post my photos to my photo blog but they would only load halfway so i decide to send them this way as it was faster. so it was fun, i'm happy and i danced the night away under the stars.  we;re gonna go to another show there tommora cuz the tow emembers of the billies that left have their own band so we're gonna check it out.  and then jenn steele's dance party after!!!! im so excited for that! this time jay and i are going to put the ps in a water bottle so we can drink it inside the mainzer and not have to walk around the block every time we want to drink it.  and jenn steele told us she got all kinds of michale jackson etc for the dancing.  i can't wait!!!!

      ok so, i have seven tattoos. daisy on my belly, team strikeforce on my right arm, a little star on each arm above the bend, an aries and taurus signs on my lower back (i know, i know) and a star on my shoulder. i have my reasons for each one but to me they are all for some kind of step of freedom or togetherness. i started when i was 19 1)the daisy came when me and my roomate becca rid ourselves of our problem roomate, had jobs and finally felt like we had freed ourselves of our parents. i got the daisy and she got two flowers, can't remember which ones. [19] 2)the strikeforce came when jake (my bf) and i had our one year anniversary (we call ourselves team strikeforce and have this logo that he created)  [20] 3 and 4) the aries and taurus i got at the same time with my roomate tim. they were to celebrate my 21st birthday and originally wanted them on my shoulders but i thought it would be less painful on my back (this was so not true). i'm right on the cusp of aries and taurus and had just learned about all that star stuff so i thought it was fitting [20, turning 21] 5 and 6) the stars on my arms i got when i went to arizona with my friends for my first real road trip. my friend luz got her ear pierced, so i guess these are the only ones i can kind of count that i got on my own. these were the best because they didn't hurt at all and the girl giving them was totally flirting with me and gave me a good deal. [22] 7) star on my shoulder. i got this one to celebrate my liberation from mervyn's, quite possibly the worst place to work ever. i liked the job a lot but the people i worked with didn't much like me which made working there horrible. i thought i was escaping my death.....then i started working at the call center........[22] this one i got when andrew got the roosters on his arms. this one didn't hurt at all either. so that is that and this is this. i really want to get another one, i love getting them. i think i'm addicted. i got my face pierced once, i think it's called the labre (that part under your mouth above your chin) and that was fantastic. it was the most wonderful orgasmic pain i have ever felt. don't get me wrong, it fuckin stung! but it felt really good at the same time. but ultimately, i don't think i'm the piercing type, plus jake used to use it as a knob to move my mouth up and down when i was sleeping and make it seem like i was singing. very annoying. so i took it out after like a month and now i have a scar under my lip. anyway, i haven't gotten one yet to celebrate something at 23. i guess i should skip cuz i'm gonna be filled up if i get one every year. i really would like to get one with rena and jasmine cuz we always always talk about it but it just never happens. maybe when rena is here on her trip i can convince her.  well, we learned a lot about me today, didn't we.  i don't know where this came from.  andrew and i were talking about how there are no pics of his tattoos and then he had one today and i started thinking about all mine i guess.

      I had the best! time today.  rena and i took a little trip to modesto, it's like 30 minutes away from merced so we just talked and listened to mirah and the all girl summer fun band.  laughing, laughing, laughing.  Hung out there for awhile and got all kinds of not nice looks from the girls that worked in the stores we went in.  it was like they were telling us we didn't belong there and kept asking us if we needed help, but not in a nice way.  needless to say we did not buy anything. The drive back was so fun, we sang at the top of our lungs to jason mraz (one of my secret favorites........although not quite so secret anymore) and as i'm singing i'm just thinking how wonderful my friend is.  i've missed her so, she's been gone for so long and we had gotten really close the past few years.   this is her story: so last summer she found out about this job at a camp in southern cali and she was gonna be gone for a few months.  I was sad but i knew i would see her again, however,   i got really sad when she decided she wanted to stay there.  so i prepared myself for her being gone all winter, which she was.  then she comes home for what i thought would be for good and then a week later they have offered her a more permanent job and she left again.  that was only supposed to be until july, which of course has turned into december again.  i've gotten used to the fact that she is going to stay there and i have no girlfriends here but it is still very sad.  so i'm going to take tomorrow and saturday off of work so i can soak up the fun while she's here.  so, yeah, this blog feels like a journal.  it's turning into, "this is what i did today".  i'm gonna try and stop, i swear.  um, also  if 'garden state' comes to your town please go see it, for me.  we're not getting it anywhere near us and won't until it proves itself in the big towns.  so please, please see it.  i've been aching for this movie for months now. also, VOTE.  please.

      so i was listening to the streets tonight and i was just having a good time listening to the absurdity of his british accent over these beats and thinking how much more interesting it was than american hip hop/rap/whatever this music is called and then i came across this song.  these are just the lyrics which are great but you really have to hear him do this song......its fantastic.  THE STREETS LYRICS "Dry Your Eyes" In one single moment your whole life can turn 'round I stand there for a minute starin’ straight into the ground Lookin’ to the left slightly, then lookin’ back down  World feels like it’s caved in – proper sorry frown Please let me show you where we could only just be, for us I can change and I can grow or we could adjust The wicked thing about us is we always have trust We can even have an open relationship, if you must I look at her she stares almost straight back at me  But her eyes glaze over like she’s lookin’ straight through me  Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity When they open up she’s lookin’ down at her feet Dry your eyes mate I know it’s hard to take but her mind has been made up There’s plenty more fish in the sea Dry your eyes mate I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts But you’ve got to walk away now It’s over So then I move my hand up from down by my side It's shakin’, my life is crashin’ before my eyes Turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh ‘Cause I can’t imagine my life without you and me There’s things I can’t imagine doin’, things I can’t imagine seein’ It weren't supposed to be easy, surely Please, please, I beg you please She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested She wraps her fingers round mine with the softness she’s blessed with he peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures By pushin’ my hand away to my chest, from hers Dry your eyes mate I know it’s hard to take but her mind has been made up There’s plenty more fish in the sea Dry your eyes mate I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts But you’ve got to walk away now It’s over And I’m just standin’ there, I can’t say a word ‘Cause everythin’s just gone I’ve got nothin’ Absolutely nothin’ T ryin’ to pull her close out of bare desperation Put my arms around her tryin’ to change what she’s sayin’ Pull my head level with hers so she might engage in  Look into her eyes to make her listen again I’m not gonna fuckin’, just fuckin’ leave it all now  ‘Cause you said it'd be forever and that was your vow And you’re gonna let our things simply crash and fall down You’re well out of order now, this is well out of town She pulls away, my arms are tightly clamped round her waist  Gently pushes me back and she looks at me straight  Turns around so she’s now got her back to my face Takes one step forward, looks back, and then walks away Dry your eyes mate I know it’s hard to take but her mind has been made up There’s plenty more fish in the sea Dry your eyes mate I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts But you’ve got to walk away now It’s over I know in the past I’ve found it hard to say Tellin’ you things, but not tellin’ straight But the more I pull on your hand and say The more you pull away Dry your eyes mate I know it’s hard to take but her mind has been made up There’s plenty more fish in the sea Dry your eyes mate I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts But you’ve got to walk away now. [ urlLink www.azlyrics.com  ]    i seriously have listened to this song on repeat i don't even know how many times.  its great.  find it and listen to it.  it will make you sad forever.

      i did my mandatory 3 hours of  urlLink dancing , here....at work. i was asked to stopapparently i was having too much fun and that was what the balloons were supposed to be for. you think i'm kidding but on the hold for analyst review they have this like muzaac techno, i was on hold for 10 minutes to that shit today. on one call. good old work. i'm the saddest that you won't be here for the drunken cookie night andrew and the "why i oughta!"s and the dancing and the billies (the BILLIES andrew!!! they haven't played in ssooooooooo long, don't you wanna know about good old bhune the sheepherder?!)  and the fun times forever.......but i know that it will probably not be quite what i want it to be and i will be sad sad sad girl again come sunday morning  sings:"i thought i knew you, i've got a new you, i thought i knew you well...oh well"  (sorry any ref to no doubt and singing will ensue.  and i don't have a new you).

      so i stayed up til 5.30 playing upwords with andrew and talking to jay v.  seriously, listen to the streets, its fuckin hilarious if you don't take him seriously.  he kicked my ass so hard and in the end we were running out of letters and getting stuff like lunsh, nex, qurames etc...  it was fun.  anway, i'm exhausted!  luckily it's not too busy but i'm so tired of answering questions for people that can figure these things out for themselves.  ex: "can you tell me how to send an picture to someone?" "do you have a copy of your user guide?" "yeah" "ok, cuz i'm just going to read it to you straight from that, so you can actually do this" "yeah but can you just do it?"  when did people stop learning how to read?! another one "i'm sorry but my system did not bring up your account, what state are you calling from?" "cingular" "no, what state?" "pico city" "ok, but what state?!" "oh alabama" Aargh. this is my life. it's like some ballon'a'gram day or something, you could send them to co workers to support the march of dimes or some shit.  anyway, the call center is filled with them and it looks like a carnival.  i wish i had my camera with me because it makes it look like we're just brimming with fun when we so totally aren't. (i really am the worst person to be representing this company aren't i?)  urlLink FUN  is headed your way.

       Me: hello thank you for calling customer care, my name is loribell, how can i help you?   man: yeah, i'm lauren   Man in background (mib): no,  laura    man:"oh, i mean laura"   me: you're laura? (he is obviously lying)   man: YES   me: ok, can you verify your ssn  mib whispers it to him and man repeats it  me: sir are you telling me that you are laura?   man: yes   me: ok, can you verify your driver's license number?  man covers the mouthpiece as the mib gives it to him  twice,  man comes back to phone  man: ok, just a sec i have to get it out of my wallet   me: are you serious?   man: what?   me:um, i heard you ask the person in the background   man:you didn't hear nothin   me: are you trying to tell me what i heard, because i don't think you have access to my ears   man: i'm the account holder! i'm lauren!   mib:  Laura!    man: Laura!   me: sir.......   man: what does it matter if i am not the fuckin account holder?!!!   me: well, that was a test and you failed so no access, sorry.  it is fraudulent for you to say that you are the account holder when you are not.   man: can i have your manager?   me: certainly lauren, i mean laura, hold please  he immediately hangs up.  this totally happened to me tonight.   oh, so andrew sent me some songs by the streets, you should totally check them out.  i don't like hip hop rap or any of that kind of music but this guy fuckin rocks.  he's got a british accent and mostly talks to music, he's great.  if you have a chance to listen, do not pass it up.  oh, i also posted some new pics to my photo blog and totally fucked up one of the links in an earlier post.  oh well.  no one reads this site anyway.

      so rena came to town today!  i came home from work and i thought the jeep parked looked like hers but i thought no, she would tell me if she was coming for a visit.  but i walk up to the door and jaysin is sitting there and i'm like "jay, what are you doing here" he says "we're going to the gym" but he's totally wearing flip flops and not gym clothes.  I said, "i'm not, i'm hungry" and then I hear "SURPRISE!" and rena jumps up from the bushes.  it was the best surprise ever.  she's been living on a mountain for like a year now.  we visited her in july but only for like two days and she's gonna be here two whole weeks.  i can't wait, fun will surely ensue.  curses that i have to work tomorrow! so we're gonna go to modesto on thursday, the puffin billies and radioactive cauliflower are playing at the mainzer on friday night and jenn steele is having a dance party on saturday! everything is falling into place to bring back my party!!!!!  i've been missing it so.  i'm gonna go drink lots of beer and dance myself pink on saturday.    i'll all worn out just reliving the excitement and anticipating the days to come.

      so i was bored, kind of sad............these are not good things for me to be at night.  i know i should not have but i got out the scissors, just to fix the back a little............................... now i really look like a 13 year old boy. the front isn't bad, i kept my flip, the back has been shorn.  i could see my natural hair color under this "blonde" on top (which by the by turned this color completely on its own after i had dyed my hair red of all colors) i could see my brown hair underneath and just couldn't get the cut even.  ended up cutting down to the brown.  if i was a little more punk rock i might be able to pull this off but i think (being me) that i will have to get a shirt that says "no, i do not want to play with  your cooter."  cuz i don't.  cuz i look like a lesbo.  and i'm not.  seriously. so now, because i did not the best job in the world i have to go to an actual hair cutting place to get the back fixed so it will be more even.  i swore i would never do that again when the last time i got my hair cut i ended up walking out like  urlLink this .  which actually looks better than what i've done to myself now.  ah irony.

      now this could be due to the fact that i buy my tops in the little boys section but i'm just not sure. (see visual aide below). so against my better judgement i will go shopping this week to purchase some new garmets that, if i aim correctly will make me look like a 14-15 year old boy at least. also, this is my new haircut. still not sure on this. so had a long awful day at work, you kid boys but that is what i deal with every day. i'm just glad i didn't get called a cunt today. i had this lady insult me and then the company and then she said "oh, but don't take it personally" in this really condescending catty way and i replied "oh don't worry (in the same tone), i won't" she asked for my manager. anyway, i got out late, stuck on a call as usual and came home to talk to my friends and sadness forever no one was on! well that's not entirely true, jay came on to say hello but alas! andrew was no where to be seen. which by the by i find very odd because he's always on when i get home from work. so there ends my day. i'll probably stay on for a bit just to catch up on my  urlLink collapse  game to see if andi smi will sign on. but if he doesn't i'm gonna go watch mad love.  try to stop me.

      so check this out  urlLink http://www.benleonard.net/downloads.html .  it has all these bands that have played in town.  at the mainzer and what used to be the trail's end.  andrew has been sending me songs from there by the jabronskis because my computer is too slow.  it reminds me that i haven't been to a show in so long.  andrew, remember when we used to all meet at the hitoga and go to a show, in between sets we'd walk to the trails or maloneys and then walk to maria's all drunk? you should come visit so that we can.............oh wait, we don't live in the hitoga, trail's is closed and the mainzer isn't the same.  suck i talked to  urlLink jayv  tonight and told him a really dumb story about my feet.  i tend to ramble.  andrew! i just got the big rig song from the jabronskis and i so want to be dancing at the mainzer right now in my polka dot dress.  sings "drive that big rig down that old highway..." its so wierd cuz if i heard this on the radio i probably wouldn't like it.  but my god don't you love the essig brothers.  for those that may be visiting, they also play in the band el olio wolof which is on that site.  the lead singer for the jabronskis is joey (rc plays bass), he is also joey no nose and then rc is the singer for el olio (joey plays the drums) and he is also radioactive cauliflower.  it's so complicated.  but they are all great.  jabronskis are my favorite of all.

      so, its sunday and i have nothing to do.  well, besides laundry.  sometimes i really like to make dirty things clean (i didn't mean that to sound so, well, dirty) and then other times i wish i could just buy new clothes every time mine got dirty.  its such a chore. besides that i'm just listening to  urlLink newbethel  and waiting for andrew to sign in.  if you happen to follow that link you will notice that they have broken up but follow the music link to kittridge records where you can hear a new bethel song, while you're there listen to the like young as well cuz they're fun. i'm contemplating making cookies.  i know that eventually today i will, probably later tonight when it cools down.  i really love baking.  when i have some kids (other than that damn brat little sully) i will be the mom that always has cookies and milk when they get home from school.  wouldn't you like to be my kid?  i just walked out to my living room to get some old tapes and i just realized how great it is to have my own apartment and support myself.  i might struggle from time to time but it beats being told how to live, you know.  i've been on my own for four years now (well, it will be four in sept), my parents thought i wouldn't last a week.  its great to prove them wrong day after day.  don't get me wrong, i love them but those were some hard times in their dungeon, i mean house.  i love having beer in my fridge, being able to stay up all night, eating cookies for breakfast, being able to dye my hair (they wouldn't  let me, always threatened to shave it off.....guess they got their wish huh)  and being able to call in sick for work and play video games all day.  its fabulous being an adult. i'm so sad new bethel broke up! molly and aaron formed anavan which i hear is pretty awesome but n b was my favorite. andrew, where are you?!

      i really should not be allowed near my own head with scissors. i have no judgement when it comes to how much actually needs to be cut off. it doesn't look too bad, i cut off all the problem areas but i think it's a tad shorter than i wanted. oh well. two week rule right?

      hey everybody!  and by everybody i mean andrew. i just did something sneaky and i feel kind of bad.  i found some jeans on ebay that i wanted so i waited until the last minute of the auction and then outbid the poor girl that had been bidding on them for days.  i got all three pairs for under 10.00 and they are great jeans and so i'm excited....but i feel bad for doing that to the girl.  someone did that to me the very first time i bid on anything and i was really mad and then i go and do it to someone else.  karma.  wait til i want something really great like a  ninja boogie death brigade or something and this will come back to haunt me, i know it.  the last two hours of work weren't so bad, we were really slow so i got to talk to emma for a while and that was nice.  me and her used to be pretty close and now we hardly see each other.  she's doing well by the by.  i think she's finally getting the keith situation under control which is nice because she deserves to be happy. i'm getting ready to cut my hair.  i'm going to dye it this week cuz i have some serious roots.  i'm contemplating going back to my natural color but will probably try to find the brightest red there is.  i want something shocking that isn't pink.  i'm tired of being known for the pink hair at work.  everyone is always asking what happended to it as if it was my natural hair color or something.  i like really bright bright fake red hair so i'm gonna search high and low. if i can't find it i guess i'll go pink again.  its a fun color and i definately get lots of attention.   i've only had it once where it was the perfect red, it was so pressure and then becca convinced me to perm it and we all know how that ended.  took three years to grow back. not fun. (see prev post)

      so i created a photo blog.  there's only like three pictures on it though because they were taking too long to load.  i hate computers, you have no idea. listening to mirah and being bored.  i hate merced right now.  if andrew still lived here we would so be playing xbox or singing kareoke.....well, i would be singing and he would be smoking on the patio.  but he would be here and not playing ev in georgia drinking vodka+apple juice all night by himself.  i want to go jump in the pool with all my clothes on cuz it's so fuckin hot....it's like 1am and i swear if it were any hotter i would be dead.  i've got work at 9am and i really don't want to go.  i really don't like working on saturdays, i mostly have to talk to dealers (i work in a call center for a cell phone company....won't say which one because it really doesn't matter, they are all the same whether you believe it or not) and they are the worst.  they always want you to do things they know that you can't do and then acting like it's your fault you can't do it.  i hate cell phones.....i truly truly hate them.  they are the cause for so much wasted money spent and unneccesary anguish and i wish people wouldn't place so much importance on them. it is so time for me to choreograph another dance, my current one is getting very tired and it's really hard to get tim to do it anymore.  i need someone who feels the beat in their soul....anyone want to help? i do! ok lori, lets go. dance party usa, mutha.

      so i think i'm gonna be up all night.  was trying not to post to the site for a few days cuz i didn't want to look like a loser that has nothing else to do except update her blogger....then i realized that at this point andrew is the only one who reads it so he already knows i'm a loser. i've just been playing this game called collapse, i'm so addicted to it.  it gets faster and faster and i have problems with my eyes focusing on fast moving things (which sucks so hard, you have no idea) so i just run the mouse all over the screen clicking hoping that i will hit on the right things and usaually i do, tonight i got my highest score/ so i'm listening to this song by maria mena and there's this line that says: "i guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down, just to keep you around cuz the day that you realize how amazing you are you're gonna leave me"     it think it's supposed to be an upbeat song (part of the chorus is: "you're the only one who holds my hair back when i'm drunk and get sick, and you're the only one who knows exactly what i mean......" etc) but that one line kind of mars it for me and i see it as kind of a tragic song.  depressing really.  maybe i just seem to be in a fucked up mood every time i hear it and that is why i have associated it with pain........who knows.  bad vibes though, for real. i've also been going thru my profile and clicking on the things i really love to see who will come up as sharing that same interest and then posting to their sites.  people are so interesting.  and i don't mean that in any kind of negative way, i just mean that it was kind of fascinating to find out  information about complete strangers.  it was fun and informative.    i think i did that in the hopes that people would do the same for my site or something.....i don't know. anway, should probably get some sleep, i have a whole day planned for movie watching tomorrow and i need to rest up.  after i watch kill bill vol 2 i won't sleep for days for fear that i will wake up and be buried alive (seriously, the most frightening scene in a movie. ever.).

      very long day at work today.....i honestly hate cell phones so much.  one day i will snap and scream "it's just a fucking mobile phone, put it in perspective" and then walk out.  jake and i are very lonely folks right now.  all our friends are gone, well jay is still here and i love him to death but we don't see each other that much to be honest.  ms emma vaca told me that she missed our parties, i do too.  .  god, it feels like it's been ages since i got super drunk and just made all kinds of noise singing and dancing and riding my bike on the roof.  i want to go down to trails end drink a bunch of amber bach while playing pool listening to my five dollars worth of songs on the juke (the same ones i played every night), walk to marias for a burrito, then go get some zima and pucker and mix it together in a frodo cup, put on my drinkin cap (eh andi), sing modest mouse at the top of my lungs, grab tim for our dance, smoke a j,  have a deep convo with someone and cry about it, make out with a girl and then at 4.00 in the morning walk to get some doughnuts at rollens.  doesn't that sound like so the best time of your life.  that is the saddest part about leaving the tioga, when we left that apartment, we left our party behind for good i think.  songs from that era that will always remind me of how popular we were for that short time: don't stop believin by journey satisfaction by rolling stones (remember that night when jake put it on at the trails and everyone was singing along?  best night ever) one more time by daft punk any puffin billies, new bethel, jaglet song go ahead by rilo kiley the entire weezer blue and pinkerton albums and the top song of all time for the hotel tioga all night diner by modest mouse (well really any modest mouse song but i think that was played the most) anway, that's my sad post for the night.  i just want to get out of this rut. miss you andrew.
