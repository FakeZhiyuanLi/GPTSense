      ...since boston isn't gonna be the 'place to be' this summer thanks to the DNC, how about an alternative?   urlLink dude, where's my horse?   no, really.  seems a bit like a working vacation, but hey, you know what they say about lazy americans... anyone for a trip to a dude ranch? ...another bit to ponder in the news...   urlLink "When people visit the parks, they need to be aware that the level of services and level of protection will not be as they should be,"    what makes me curious is that when i go to a national park i am usually there to hike, or drive as far as the local roads take me, then get out and walk... the only amenity that would be nice but not required is a clean bathroom/pit toilet.  i'll even bring my own toilet paper.  what i don't need to see is another tourist trap cluttering up the wilderness.  a ranger's station is sufficient and if the government would just cover the cost of that, well then... joy.  otherwise, um, what does all the money they get end up being spent on?  you don't need services and programs to enjoy a freakin walk in the woods.  buy a map, try not to get lost.  a good pair of shoes or hiking boots would be a plus too.  i'm sorry to say but i am not a tree hugger, i just love the wilderness.  if the tree cannot survive on it's own without the help of humans, it wasn't meant to survive. let it go.  there will be another one, not to worry.  and as for wildfires, that is a great place to spend the funds allocated to the national parks.  the more the better.  but not for paved trails.  cut that shit out.  can't see bear prints on tar and you are in his back yard.  dirt is good for you.  why do we need rangers to patrol the parks?  are the animals gonna steal it from us? watch towers for wildfires, great idea, put rangers to work doing this.  parks on the american borders, another need for security.  but maybe not a park ranger.  don't we have a military to 'protect our borders'?   ...before i stray to far and enrage anyone:  i love to hike, go as often as i can... i teach my kids to respect the woods, not trample the grounds around them and leave no trace camping/hiking.  but i just do not understand the need for a tour guide to show us a beautiful view or a big tree.  get a book, read up on the history of the park you want to visit, get a 'been there' t-shirt from a store in the local town that could use the buisness and don't litter.  not difficult.  ok, ok, /rant.   ...sorry, it's way past my bedtime and i'm cranky.

      for quite some time now, i've been reading other blogs.  one in particular because he is quite entertaining... and as soon as i learn how, i will add some links and you can check him out.  anyway, today's post was a flash back, to the time around 9/11.  dealing with racial profiling.  just the phrase alone makes me tense.  i am a white american, lived overseas, but looks alone i'd probably not be asked for an ID as much as a non-white person might. the term racial profiling makes me feel like i should apologize for my skin color.  i don't believe we should ID anyone based on looks alone.  yet i do understand the immense fear after what happened on 9/11.  so many if's... if we paid more attention, if we didn't have any corruption in our own government, if we followed rules we created in the beginning to keep our selves safe, if we didn't cut budgets where it counted and had the people or equipment necessary ....  well, it happened.  now we're left to deal with it.  i still don't believe in racial profiling.  and i don't get angry when the airport security tells me to take off my shoes.  just because i am white doesn't mean i think racial profiling is right.  i'm sure there is an answer that is politically correct to all of this... and i am also sure there will be many people who have lost or will lose loved ones because of terror issues that will want answers and actions.  it's a shame it isn't a perfect world.  just as it would be a shame if a person of another ethnic backgound known to be some type of extremist crashed a plane on your loved one, knowing it could have been avoided had someone ID'd him before he got on the plane.  touchy subject for sure...  you got the right answer?

      so if you've been living on the moon recently, let me fill you in.  another threat of beheading hostages is in the news.  one group in particular:  Islamic Response.  they claim to have an american marine --this is not yet confirmed-- and that they will behead him if their demands are not met.    so does this mean that those who follow the islamic religion think it is ok to behead or kill a human being that (god) created?  apparently so.  paul johnson, Kim Sun-il and Nicholas Berg, they didn't deserve the punishment they received.  all in the name of islam?    it isn't difficult to believe that broad statement, and i do realize how one-sided the american media is.  but for so long now, all i've heard is how many other countries do not want to help us with the iraqi situation.  and how many people there want us out.  so, where are all the islamics that think this beheading trend is horrible and wrong?  how come there is more than enough people to rally against president bush arriving in turkey and not enough islamics rallying against these disgusting terrorists slandering the good name of their religion by beheading innocent people?  makes it hard to believe in the holiness of islam.  just when you thought it was only the catholic religion that lost it's way.   maybe at this point, we should leave iraq.  they want to 'clean up' their country, fine.  do it.  get help from the UE and NATO and the UN.  oh, wait, these are useless unions of lazy beaurocrats.  why else would saddam have been able to get away with all the killings he commited.  it was never a secret.  and none of those groups stopped him.  weapons of mass destruction or not, many many many people died there... i guess that was ok?    so how about this:  how about we spend those millions on evacuating the good decent people of iraq, then release all the prisoners and terrorists back into the region.  and then use those american made bombs to erradicate the region and return it, and them, to dust.  then we can spend the rest of those millions rebuilding it and let the fine upstanding citizens rule themselves.  if it doesn't work, fuck it.  i'm sure haliburton will make enough money to find it a reasonable plan.    i really do not think that this is turning into another vietnam.  but it certainly shows errors in our current administration and a definite shame to all involved in this mess.  i'm just not so sure november elections can clean up such a mess.  so much for democracy.

      ...ever have one of those days you just want to shake everyone you come in contact with?  what the hell is wrong with everyone??  not to imply i am sane or even normal, but wtf is with people?  from the idiot who bagged my groceries and put the yogurt in with the apples and then put the rolls in the bag too, to the idiot who passed me doing 90mph while i was going less than 5 miles over the limit cuz i knew after the next exit there were two state troopers on motorcycles with a radar gun waiting so i behaved and that speeding man didn't get caught, to the waste of breath man that interrupted me while i was asking the clerk for information just cuz he was in a hurry, as if i had all frikkin' day...  hmm, i guess it wasn't a good day, i could go on, but i am annoying myself.  movie review:  mystic river.  excellent.  4 stars out of 5, kinda dragged for a few minutes and the boston accent was just so wronged.  but go rent/buy it, was worth it.

      this has been a fun week hasn't it.  i was gonna bring up some current events but after reading about it for days and days, i've had enough.    i did, however, take the kids to see the new harry potter flick.  wasn't bad, but i admit, i've read the books and the books are always better.  by far, the second movie was better.  and for your home video viewing pleasure, check out the lord of the rings return of the king.  although i wasn't really into watching these movies, i managed to see enough to catch my attention.  if you look past the grand fighting scenes and catch some of the dialogue, it had a plot and a theme.  and it wasn't bad at all.  but since i didn't pay attention to all three of these movies, could someone please explain to me why frodo had to leave with the others on the ship as it sailed away from middle earth?    man i am just plain lazy, can't even think of thing to blog about.    someone wanna mow the lawn for me?  i'm still sick.  chicken soup???

      living in the middle of the nowhere in particular limits my pizza intake.  noone delivers in the boonies.  all for the better i guess.  nibbling on carrot chips dipped in fat free ranch dressing is better i suppose.  it's the commercials on TV that get ya... i'd kill for a spicy chicken sandwich from wendy's right about now...  it's lack of sleep, really.  see, in the wee hours of this morning when i couldn't sleep, i was flipping channels on television and came across a commercial.  seems innocent enough.  for a blender.  but there in the commercial, probably not intentionally, is the reason why so many americans are over weight.     "it's that simple, you don't have to do a thing and clean up is a snap, just put it in the dishwasher"     seems innocent enough, but my brain was fully awake at 4a.m.  ...what it should have stated is this:   "it's that simple, don't get off your lazy ass to make a low-fat-good-for-you smoothie... snap the 'cup' on, push the button, turn it off, and take the 'cup' to go.  the rest is dishwasher safe, no point in wasting energy washing dishes when a machine can do it for you."   i misplaced the remote during this commercial so i was forced to watch the entire thing.  cuz after all, why would i get up to change the channel?  i don't think i can do that on the TV itself anyway, can i?

      what the hell is wrong with people?  (don't answer that)  On the way back from a day trip hiking we took a few scenic roads home.  doing this we fully expected traffic.  no problem.  most of these back roads are twisty and narrow so going over 35mph is difficult.  as soon as we hit a major roadway, the few cars in front of us picked up speed, as did i, and off we went... a tad over the limit of 55mph... but pleasant.  out of nowhere a car came up behind us, there was room to pass so off he went, but instead of just passing me, he goes around all 4 of us ahead of him.  staying in the left lane for so long that the car coming from the other direction had to pull into the (breakdown lane) ditch on the side of the road to avoid a head on collision.   dumbass.  so while we are commenting on dumbass #1, dumbass #2 is heading straight for my car in my lane, coming at me, passing several cars on his side of the road.   now ...seeing as i am extremely impatient with anyone over the age of 16, i decide i am not pulling over into the ditch to let him go by.  nope, no fucking way.   all the while my hubby is telling me to just pull over and let the guy go, i am thinking to myself "oh shit, this guy is gonna hit us!"  but nope.  dumbass #2 pulls over in my breakdown lane instead of me.  and as i pass him, he is giving me the finger and screaming out his window.   victory is mine.   stupid dumbasses.

      well, it's good to be home.&nbsp; ok, maybe not.&nbsp; i'd much rather be camping still ...  thankfully the weather was perfect!&nbsp; our neighbors at the campsite, or lack-there-of was great... the river wasn't too high, perfect for playing in the 'rapids'.... mighty current even if the river was only two feet deep at the spot we were at... dry firewood, and a starry sky.... can't ask for more than that....   did i mention the blueberries we picked and ate on the trail?&nbsp; not another person for a mile....  i'm trying to remember why i came home....&nbsp;

      well, it's that time of year again.&nbsp; time to get away from it all, pack a few things in a bag, grab the tent and find a nice secluded spot in between a few trees and a river&nbsp;to kick back and count the stars at night.&nbsp;  i really hope it doesn't rain.&nbsp; but then again, a rainy day camping is better than a good day stuck in the house....   enjoy your week!&nbsp;

      although i didn't start watching the sopranos until last september, i nevertheless became hooked on it.&nbsp; which means i actually have to pay for HBO if i want to watch it.&nbsp;  but now this:&nbsp;  urlLink Sopranos Won't Be Back Until 2006    so if i cancel my HBO there is a $15.00 fee.&nbsp;&nbsp; if i want to add it back on later, yup, a $15.00 fee.&nbsp;   damned if you do, damned if you don't.&nbsp; all for a freakin' tv show.&nbsp;

      how do you answer that question?&nbsp; especially if you've never been to another country.&nbsp; do you need to have a comparison?&nbsp; is patriotism supposed to be blind? &nbsp;  depending on your age, i'm sure there are a lot of answers to that question.&nbsp; maybe if you're older, seen some wartime, it takes on a new meaning.&nbsp; maybe if you're&nbsp;younger you lean towards arrogance at the whole idea of patriotism because all you've known all your life is what you have been handed and what you feel you're owed or missing.&nbsp;   whenever i hear on the news of someone joining the military because they want to 'serve their counrty' i cringe.&nbsp; do you really?&nbsp; do you honestly understand what that phrase means?&nbsp;  anger is easy, they bomb our buildings and kill our people, let's go bomb them and theirs.&nbsp; that'll work, have we learned nothing from history?&nbsp; unfortunately&nbsp;a flip side to that, letting the big corporations step in, make it all about money and power and yet again forget about the actual people involved...still we get nowhere.&nbsp; how do we know the 'democratic way' is the right way?&nbsp; we don't all subscribe to the same religion, why would one set of politics work if one God doesn't? &nbsp;  being a proud american is not a simple statement anymore.&nbsp; human beings as a whole have successfully managed to complicate everything.&nbsp; nothing is simple anymore.&nbsp; you can't be tolerant if you can't agree to disagree.&nbsp; our opinions have become our war-stance.&nbsp; do we feel like we have something to prove?&nbsp; or maybe we have something to disprove?&nbsp;   i have strong opinions, if you don't subscribe, fine, if you'd like to express your opinion, do so.&nbsp; it's always good to hear how others feel.&nbsp;   i am proud to be an american.&nbsp; yes, i've lived in another country but i don't feel that it is necessary to do&nbsp;&nbsp;to be proud of the country you live in.&nbsp; i believe in God to a certain extent.&nbsp; and i love the fact that here in america i can say this out loud and hear it from others without fear.&nbsp; if you want to pray in public, knock yourself out, i don't... but i also don't feel the need to dictate how you 'praise' your God.&nbsp; in being tolerant, you have to learn how to allow other people to have their 'freedoms', after all, isn't that what america is about?&nbsp; personal freedoms, personal rights.&nbsp;  too many americans today have adopted the notion that they are underpaid, underappreciated, unfairly judged or wronged in some way.&nbsp; maybe these people need to take a step beyond the borders just to see how 'rich' their lives really are and what great opportunites they have available to them.&nbsp; i'm not so blind to think that there aren't any people at all that have been wronged, i'm sure some issues are real and deserve attention and justice.&nbsp; if money is how you rate quality of life, you're missing out on so much.&nbsp; same goes for fame.&nbsp;  in my pursuit of happiness i expect only one thing, that you respect my personal space, which i have right here in my home, where i am free to turn off the television if i don't care for the programming, shut of the music if i don't care for the lyrics, seperate myself from my community if i don't agree with the way things are being run.&nbsp;  i vote so that i may retain the right to complain if i am not satisfied at the way things turn out.&nbsp; being inactive is the same as being ignorant.&nbsp; do something.&nbsp; because doing nothing and complaining is meaningless.&nbsp;   this rant all came about after watching the news... i don't normally climb on my soapbox and vent, especially here in my blog where i am sure to receive a heaping of shit mail for my views.&nbsp; i won't tell you who to vote for in the upcoming election but i will tell you i am voting for kerry/edwards because i am unhappy at the way things are going.&nbsp; i only hope you'll be active in how your country is run.&nbsp; being a 'fair-weathered american' is like only rooting for your favorite sports team when they are in the finals.&nbsp; i get angry when this country behaves stupidly.&nbsp; i am thrilled when we make a difference in another country.&nbsp; either way, i am still&nbsp;proud of my country.&nbsp;

      about 6 months ago, i decided it was time to get a&nbsp;DVD player.&nbsp; yes, i was addicted to VHS... or at least too busy to care to upgrade... so now that i've got this new toy i decided to go thru all the VHS tapes and minimize, make room for DVD's.&nbsp;  this weekend's winners, or at least the ones i watched again:  American History X -- how could you not love edward norton?&nbsp; rather violent but still....  The Sixth Sense -- nope, i didn't have it figured out till the end.&nbsp; which makes it a really good movie...  Fight Club-- hey, another edward norton, and yup, you guessed it, rather violent...  Bone Collector-- figured out the 'whodunnit' part but still, adreneline movie  The Mexican-- i thought this was gonna be a very lame movie, but it wasn't so bad...  Primal Fear-- &nbsp; richard gere,&nbsp;hmm, eddy again.... good movie, even if he was guilty. &nbsp; maybe i should 'ebay' the rest of movies in the box, that means i have to admit to once buying them... i'll have to give that more thought...

      first of all, i'm 34 years old.&nbsp; music from the 50's and 60's are oldies.&nbsp; 70's and 80's&nbsp;are classics.&nbsp; and the 90's, well, they're just the 90's, not far off from 2004.&nbsp; but for VH-1, and their "I Love the 90's", no.&nbsp; sorry.&nbsp;  way  too soon!&nbsp; i liked the "I Love the 70's/80's", brought back some funny, embarrassing, omg no way, hey i remember that...memories.&nbsp; but the 90's...&nbsp; it hasn't been long enough for those to be  memories  just yet.&nbsp; i'm still trying to forget some of those years, now is not the time to open those wounds.&nbsp;  &nbsp; as a replacement, another 'ted nugent reality show' would be so much better.&nbsp; i know a lot of you thought that show sucked, but ya know what... for&nbsp;a reality show, it  rocked!

      it's july.&nbsp; and it's a voting year.... but damn, we've still got months more of these tv ads and crap&nbsp;to endure.&nbsp; i've already had my fill.&nbsp; way back when, seeing as i am in the state of NH and we get to hear it for months before many other states, well, i made up my mind who i wanted in office for the next president.&nbsp; i didn't get to meet all the democrats running, but 4 of them was plenty.&nbsp; and my choice didn't make it.&nbsp; dammit.&nbsp; so i had to do some rethinking....  &nbsp; i am not necessarily a democrat, nor am i a republican.&nbsp; can't even call myself an independant.&nbsp; i just vote for what i think is real.&nbsp; the last presidential race was awful.&nbsp; bush v. gore.&nbsp; jeez.&nbsp; how'd that happen?&nbsp; and now this time, bush v. kerry.&nbsp; i keep shaking my head.&nbsp; dammit.&nbsp;  &nbsp; i do intend on voting.&nbsp; unhappily.&nbsp; so where are all the good, wise&nbsp;politicians?&nbsp; the ones who haven't been doing the political thing for too long and gotten lost or have too much money and are so far from the 'real world' they shouldn't think about running?&nbsp; sorry to say but i haven't yet seen or heard of the right woman for the job.&nbsp; besides, the presidents hubby wouldn't last four days let alone four years in office while she was constantly unavailable, leaving only the young pretty interns with berets to attend to his needs.&nbsp; that would be a best selling book i'm sure... &nbsp; maybe we can just get our next president off ebay?&nbsp;

      first of all, let's clarify:  i am not a 'tool belt wearing' kinda person... i can swing a hammer, screw a screw (shut up...), build a quaint little birdhouse, even paint... but when it comes to the actual building of a structure, well, i can hand you the hammer or hold that ladder for ya...  so today, i helped a friend and his girlfriend do some work on what will be a 30' x 24' barn when it is done... they've got all the posts up, marked by way of laser level... secondary posting in, next up, lifting 20' boards up to near the top of the posts, and bolting them in place.   *note*  i hate ladders.  but so does his girlfriend, and she is afraid of heights, so feeling bad for her i volunteered to climb the ladder with one end of the 20' board, yeah heavy as all hell.  and while i am standing too high up on a ladder, holding this heavy thing, shaking like a leaf in a tornado, i am thinking maybe the horses will be fine in a tent...?   i'm pretty sure this is one of the 485675639 reasons why i am not in the construction business.   hard work never killed anyone right?  just leaves you with scrapes, bruises, broken fingernails, and a grand desire to descend that ladder and dive into a pool full of margarita....

      yes, you read right.  i love traffic.  traveling at 55mph just to come to a screaching halt because the numbnut in front of you dropped his ciggarette in his lap and decided to hit the brakes while searching for it...  only to then pull over and out of the way but it's too late by then cuz my seatbelt has now tightened securely to hold me in place for the impending accident and i can't breathe let alone shout out what i really feel he needs to hear.  and when all is said and done and i've calmed enough to drive, i get back on the road behind idiot #2.  the cell phone user.  i have no problem with cell phones and driving, talk away, go ahead, i don't care.  but dammit.  dammit.  get a frikkin' ear piece cuz swaying on the road while trying to keep that thing in between your ear and your shoulder is gonna get you rear-ended by me!  get off the damn phone and drive if your too frikkin cheap to buy a hands-free attachment for your over priced phone!    ok, i feel better now, don't you?   the internet really needs a sarcasm font, it would be so helpful.    i know, i know, a rant that no one can hear, but i bet you've all been there.   now i need a drink.  cheers

      it's been a while since i've taken a moment just to browse other people's blogs.  i find it interesting to read what other people have to say... (ok, except for the younger ones and their ever so abundant angst).    anyway... i have had the same blogs listed to the side (over there-----> ) for some time now, and sooner or later i will add some more... but out of boredom, i browsed 'their' blogs listed...   the end result:  we're all bored.  we all ramble, rant, vent, blabber, babble and just plain type.  some we're quite interesting, it isn't an easy thing to do when you 'shout' out your opinion on your blog for the 'whole world' to read.  nope, not easy because it inevitably means an email full of comments that you might not want to read.    and then there's the ones that i find myself checking up on every time i am sitting here at my computer... as if i need to check on a family member or friend... really now, this is like stalking.  i don't usually leave comments so i am a stranger in all sense of the word. so checking to see if you've posted has now gone from mere interest to a need.  need to check to see if you've blogged.  wonder why you haven't.  is something wrong, are you gonna come back and blog again?  omg what will i do if you don't blog again?  you'll be missed.    man, that is just freaky, don't ya think?    yeah, i am bored.  thanks for paying attention.  feel free to stalk :)

      remember the days when the worst news on the tv was about that little brat down the street and his friends riding their skateboards on the newly paved road and the old ladies called the cops cuz they didn't want their street ruined by punks?   ok so maybe you didn't live where i did.  but i miss it.  the more i hear about the war on terrorism, iraq, oil stuff, the UN, the president of the US, the more i want to scream, pull out my hair, run about slapping everyone i see upside the head.   is that wrong?  cuz man, does it ever seem necessary.    i do not want to sound like i am belittling the seriousness of world events, by no means, i assure you, i am not.  but dammit.  wtf!  in the 'old days'if tommy spit on sally, tommy's mom would smack his ass red and send him to his room with no dinner and make him apologize too!  but now, tommy's mom would be doing hard time with murderers and thieves for child abuse, and tommy would have knocked sally up by raping her and their kid left on a door step somewhere, but that's ok, cuz there are programs to help both of them achieve their GED's and get a job that pays just enough to buy them cigs and beers.    hm, i sound like such a negative person.  wonder how that happened?

      ...imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. and when a 5 year old boy is imitating you at a grocery store while you pick and choose fresh fruits and veggies, don't pretend to eat them, the kids always get caught. oops. i think i really pissed off the little boys mom cuz now she had to pay for that really large pineapple.

Some of the others that got the axe:  urlLink Kathleen Madigan , and  urlLink Ant , not to mention  urlLink Todd Glass , very funny people....  and i must mention...  urlLink Gary Gulman  reminds me of  urlLink Dane Cook  , has a lot of his manerisms....... dane is so much more than funny, he is a god.  one hell of a sexy god too.  ya know, in case that sort of thing is important for you to know...

      Back about three years ago i made my first webpage, all with the help of my ISP at the time.... i blogged when blogging wasn't 'in'.  problem was it was a pretty lame page setup and i let anyone including my family read it.  that was a mistake.     so after a while i ditched the page, moved and got a new ISP and decided to try again, this time with my own ideas and lots of swiped icons, backgrounds, etc... even learned how to create a template, though i've forgotten tons already.   anyway.... new ISP, free space, new page went up.  some of the bloggers i read frequently would comment, i added a '101 things about me', and a sort of bio page, and a few other things, nothing special...  i'm not exactly sure how, but one of my family members got to my page, this time i didn't outright share it... i didn't censor my page a bit, not like last time where all my posts were read, re-read and edited to make sure i didn't cross anyone.   that got tiring so i was not so careful.  i spoke my thoughts thru my blog, never particularly vented toward anyone yet still my opinions and thoughts we always scrutinized by friends and some family that read it.   so fuck 'em all, set me up at blogger.com and off i went... now mind you, i haven't posted anything thought provoking, nothing that would earn me a slew of hate mail, and certainly nothing that would anger my friends or family but when i was checking out my nedstat (tells me who comes to visit here), i recognized an ISP and just about fell off my damn chair.  granted this may be anyone at all and not who i think it is, afterall, more than one person will subscribe to this service.  but holy crap what a fright i had.  i was tempted to go back and read my archives to make sure i didn't set off another reason to 'beat on jan for her blog'.   so to that lovely bunch of people i am so lucky to call family, go away, not like you've got a clue about me anyway... and to those friends who want to know the 'real me':  i swear.  a lot.  i have opinions and like to say them out loud once in a while.  whether they fit you're mold of me or not, too bad.  and um, thanks for the tequila robin, if you can't make the world go away, it's nice to know you can make it numb.   joy to the world, all the boys and girls, joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me....

      dammit.  i found a bat.   he lives in between my house and the attached garage in a tiny area... he can't really get into the house itself... and it doesn't matter if he can get into the garage because there are many ways to get out, not all that airtight... he eats mosquitoes and insects so he is a good pet but well, there's still the fact that he is a BAT!  i don't know if i should just name him or try to shooo him out... i think he is pissed at me at the moment though, i thought he was a hornet making a nest up there so i sprayed the spot with that foaming hornet spray.  maybe he'll go elsewhere now that it stinks in the garage...

      when i was in my twenties i drank in social situations, which was basically anytime time that i wasn't working.  as i got older, i curbed the habit, got married, had kids and well, since then the drinking part fell to the wayside.  a glass of wine occaionally, beer every now and then.   back then, my drink of choice was whiskey.  no real reason, just liked it.  now, it is tequila.  i swear after three shots it goes down like water.  now, i know when i was younger, i thought i was immortal, i could work a ten hour shift, drink till dawn and be on time for another ten hour shift.  with a smile on my face.  but nowadays, forget it.   my hubby and i helped a friend work on his barn yesterday, not that i could do much, so i took pictures.... to thank us for helping, my friend gave me a bottle of tequila.   eleven shots later.... i was out.  i woke up this morning and although i am not sure, i think i may have been hit by a train.  omg.  so for the rest of this day i plan on crawling off into a corner repeatedly reminding myself that while many things change as we grow older, our stupidity remains with us... such a constant companion.  lovely.

      have you ever watched that show, ya know, with paul sr. and paulie jr., mikey, and vinnie?  urlLink orange county choppers.    i understand the lure of it, to see the finished bike and all it's glory... but did ya ever notice every 'episode' is similar:  "aw man, i don't think we're gonna get this bike done in time cuz the chrome came back so late...."  and the voice over of the narrator always repeats this as if we didn't hear it already:  "...and with the chrome coming back late, well, the guys at occ are running late and may not get the bike done in time..."  oooo so suspenseful..... i have to keep watching to see if they get it done in time.   and i do.  the things we do for the ones we love.   i better get me some luvin' tonight for watching not one but  two  epsiodes of that show with my hunny.   sheesh.

      happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday 'josh' happy birthday to you!!!!!!  be glad you can't hear me sing that, i can't carry a tune to save my life.  today is  urlLink josh's  birthday. go wish him a happy birthday. go ahead, i'll wait....  your horoscope:   Dreams and visions might come and go in and out of your mind today, dear Leo, as unconscious drives and images continue to surface. Some of these impressions could represent old traumas and phobias from the past that have outlived their usefulness and need to be released. You could also draw creative inspiration from these perceptions and use them as a basis for artistic projects. By the day's end you may feel two tons lighter - emotionally, at least!    ...that makes so much sense. i think what it means is 'have a great day!'

      so far i've seen a couple episodes of this show, last comic standing.... i guess they all live in a house together, canceling each other out as they go along, and now there are 6 left, something like that...  tonight's show was meant to narrow it down to 3. but we don't get to find out till the next show, which 3 will  move on ...  so... each comic gets a few minutes to makes us giggle, and there are also brief 'interview' type shots where they get to talk and tell us about themselves or whatever... now, i gotta say... it's not too bad of a 'reality' type show... but ya know something.... the last thing i wanna hear from a comedian is an emotional type 'why i should win' kinda speech.  no.  just make me laugh, don't draw me into your life with a cute or sad story.  no . just make me laugh. i don't care how you've struggled to get to where you are today, or what your goal in life is. you are a comedian on a television show.  c'mon now . make me laugh or you're gone!  gone i tell ya !!!! i get three votes from my home phone and like the man said (jay mohr, the host), it's a free call. plus i can vote online! go internet go! so..... if only i knew their names, i'd be all over that voting thing.

      i can't believe it's august already! where'd july go??? it's already 'back-to-school' shopping time (silent cheering from my chair) and my kids are SO ready to go back! ok, maybe i am more ready for them to go back, but whatever... one month vacation is plenty.  yesterday, i took my son to get some new sneakers.... he's 12, going on 35. he already knew what he wanted, mowed the lawn at least 10 times to earn the money for them. (mind you, our lawn is acres) so now he is the proud owner of a pair of sneakers that were more expensive than my entire closet of shoes. damn. but he earned them.  so while we're browsing the aisles for clothes for my daughter (she's 9) i can't help but notice there is no difference in buying for a 9 year old than buying for me (not a 9 year old). all the jeans, low rise, snug fitting in the seat, tops cut to fit, cropped to show off ... show off what? a 9 year olds belly button?! wtf. she found a pair of jeans to try on, slipped into the changing room and came out to show me. when she came out, she told me she didn't like the pants, (thank god) so i asked why...  "cuz I can't sit down in them without my bum showing."  and that is what happens when you sit on the floor in a 4th grade classroom when it is circle time and all the kids sit on the rug in front of the teacher while she talks....  who decides what children's clothes should look like anyway? children in elementary school should not look 'sexy'. it's sick. it just is.  funny how all the boys clothes are baggy and loose fitting with a hundred oversized pockets on the jeans and t-shirts that are too big for me.
