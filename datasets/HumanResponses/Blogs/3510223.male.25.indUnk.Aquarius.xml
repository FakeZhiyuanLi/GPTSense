        this entry brought to you by  radiohead, "kid a"    

The first time I did an introduction for a webpage, it was unsure, tentative, and, honestly, a bit bumbly. Mostly because at the time I only had a vague idea as to exactly what I wanted the page to be about. Now, however, it's been four years to the month since I first started doing this sort of thing, and if my previous server-- scribble.nu-- hadn't gone down for weeks at a time during its last year of existence, I'd have done well over 1,100 entries. As it is I've 980 something entries under my belt.  

Why am I bothering telling you this, you, who's probably never even heard of me? I don't know. To set this apart? There are only three hundred thousand  million  blogs on blogger.com, some of which have been around years. So if I were to sum up this introduction in a few words, I'd say:  I MEAN BUSINESS .  

 MISSION STATEMENT   

* Words and Ramblings will be written and posted daily. Except when I absolutely, positively cannot make my self imposed deadline. But it's a  self imposed  deadline, so if I miss it, well, shit happens.  

* Words and Ramblings will have a different topic every day. Except when I decide to spread the same topic over a period of several days. Key thing here, though, is that I will have honest-to-god  topics .  

* Words and Ramblings will never be about stupid day-to-day shit. You'll never read about how so-and-so at work is such a dick and I hate him, and my supervisor's such a jerk, and this is how class was and  yadda yadda yadda . I also promise never to gush, post after post, about how much I love my wife and/or kid.  

* Words and Ramblings will not be one of those blogs where I do a quiz a day, post the results, and do not add any extra commentary. If I post quiz results, it will be on a rare filler day, and I promise to add something else to it.  

* Words and Ramblings will be mostly humor, often political, sometimes outright silly, occasionally serious, and never personal enough to bore you. If it bores you, it'll be for other reasons. It may contain jokes you won't get, and it might--  might  offend you-- and I swear to God, you'll rarely read a blog that uses swear words with such a fucking huge frequency  as effectively .   

* Words and Ramblings will always be bitter. Unless I'm intentionally being sweet. Which I never am.  

* Words and Ramblings will not be worth reading every day. This is a promise.  

* Words and Ramblings will be worth reading sometimes. This is a promise. -----

 THE GOOD    

 Starting up a new site  There's kind of a mixed feeling with this new version of  words and ramblings . On the one hand, it's nice to be writing again. It's nice to know that all the things that have been going through my head over the past few months that I've wanted to write about will finally have an outlet. On the other hand, with my work schedule, and taking care of Celest and all the things that come with growing up, since I've had such a long break, I'm afraid I won't be able to get myself back into that daily regimen that I used to so religiously stick to. I'm afraid that, mentally, I just won't be able to keep up like previously. For example, I haven't written a line of code for the design of the blogger, and I want to redesign the main site at  urlLink bitterisataste.com , but will I be able to muster up the enthusiasm like I once could? In many ways, I really  am  starting off fresh again, even though I really don't want to be, and yet I don't feel like I'll be able to get back on track this page being how it was in its prior life. On the other hand, now I can continue making fun of George W. Bush on a  global  scale instead of just with my wife and coworkers.   

 John Kerry  Speaking of President Bush, if John Kerry doesn't win the up-coming election, I'm going to cry. And I'm not just saying that to be hyperbolic, I mean literally, tears will erupt from my eyes, and over the next four years I will be stuck in an unmovable, sucking, black cloud of damnation and despair. That is, of course, assuming the UnPresident doesn't figure out some horrible, unthinkable way of keeping himself in the White House indefinitely, which he undoubtedly will. And in that case, I'll move to Canada. That way I can buy lots of weed and put myself in a giggly, uncaring haze, so the unspeakable acts that commence forth for the rest of eternity won't have an effect on me. And I really, really don't like weed, so I'm praying against all hopes Kerry wins.  

  Jackie Brown   I've seen  Kill Bill  now (I don't know whether I'll give it a full review later on or talk about it in next week's Polarity), and going back and seeing  Jackie Brown  again was really an interesting comparison.  Brown  is neither as manic and geeky as  Bill , nor as preoccupied with making its characters and dialogue as memorable as  Pulp Fiction . Tarantino geeks might use this to say that  Jackie  is the weakest of his movies, but its subtlety and finesse make it a stand-out. Comparing it to his other films, it's definitely the odd fox out, but that's part of what makes it so damned  good . Whereas both  Pulp Fiction  and  Kill Bill  almost seem as if they have to prove how cool they are,  Jackie  just  is  cool.   

  urlLink Celestial Dawn, our baby   While I promised yesterday that I wouldn't go by, day to day, gushing about my daughter, I don't think that an occasional update would be out of the question, especially considering regular readers haven't heard anything about her in literally months. The only news of note, other than her talking a lot more (it's just been recently that she's started saying "no", which I definitely think is a good thing considering she said "yes" and "good" way before she said "no", except than when she says "no" she has to  shout  it), is that she's going to day care now a few times a week. She seems to be getting along very well there-- every time I go to pick her up, she's always dancing and running around and having a little too much fun. Ah, to be a kid again.    

 Glad Press N' Seal Wrap  Have you tried this stuff? I don't normally think of myself as much of a consumer whore, but lets face it, give me a  gadget -- and don't fool yourself, top-of-the-line plastic wrap is as much a gadget as anything else-- and I roll around in hog heaven. Press N' Seal will  revolutionize  the way you use plastic wrap. I mean, when was the last time you Saran Wrapped  soup  and could turn it upside down without a rubber band around it,  and the soup didn't fall out ? If Glad Press N' Seal Wrap were a woman, I'd want to see her in a porno. Or at least a steamy "art" movie.  



 THE BAD    

 Scribble.Nu  There used to be this weblog server called scribble. And it was good. It did everything I wanted it to do. It was comfy, it was user friendly, and so what if the majority of the user base was half retarded?  It did everything I wanted it to do . Then, starting around 2003, it started going down. A lot. And I don't just mean a day here and there, I'm talking for weeks at a time.  Weeks . And since, I don't know, February, it's gone down and hasn't come back up. It looks as if it never will.  The problem? I'd written over 980 entries on that thing that I did  not  want to move to another server. Worse, I didn't even get a chance to back up the last hundred something entries-- which was entirely my fault, but I wouldn't have  had  to back up my entries if they'd gave us a heads up, like, "Hey kids, looks like we'll soon not be existing, better get your shit together while you have a chance." The reason it's taken me so long to get a new site up and running is because, honestly, none of the sites really satisfy me in the right way. So I'm really  compromising  with blogger, as I would have with any other site. And I'm still bitter about the whole thing.   

  urlLink Coachella   You know, it's almost a good thing that this page didn't exist over the past several months, because week to week you would've read my excitedness over the Coachella Music and Arts Festival in the weekly Polarities, only for it to hit an anti-climax. See, we'd heard about the Festival back in February and started planning it, and as the weeks went by, it seemed more and more possible that we could do it. We  had  to do it. Radiohead was playing-- tickets were 75 dollars per day, with over 100 bands playing both days. I'd pay 75 bucks to see Radiohead  alone . The Flaming Lips were playing. The Pixies, The Cure, Stereolab, Le Tigre. We went through a downloading  frenzy , and over the past several months our music listening habits utterly changed. We bought CDs by The Black Keys, Electric Six, Postal Service, Desert Sessions, Cooper Temple Clause, International Noise Conspiracy, Trail of Dead, Howie Day, and several others, as well as downloaded hundreds of MP3s, music we would've never been exposed to if it hadn't been for our anticipation for Coachella. We were  hyped , and it looked as if everything was going to go down nice and smooth. All we needed was to wait for the car registration to show up so we could cross the state line. And then, a full week before opening day, the tickets sell out. What the hell kind of festival sells out? Well, apparently I know the answer now: a really, really  good  one sells out. I can't tell you how disappointed we were.  "But Chris!" I hear you saying. "Why didn't you just buy tickets as soon as you had the money?" Because we have a kid and a very old car. We needed to make sure everything was worked out before we threw 150 down the drain, only to learn we couldn't go. I'd honestly have preferred it if we couldn't have gone  because  of something like that, because at least we tried. But tickets selling out? Didn't see that one coming. Excuse me while I go cry in my closet.   


 Jessica Simpson  Goddammit, but I'm tired of seeing this untalented, horse-toothed freak on every fucking magazine cover in America. What's funny is, I don't know a single person who isn't instantly annoyed by the very sight of her. I don't understand how someone this universally disliked could possibly be this ubiquitous. She's like Fidel Freaking Castro, only with an impossibly annoying reality TV show  that just got renewed for a second season . And Fidel Castro is better looking.  

  Identity   It's not that I hated it, but it's been a while since I've seen a movie that tried so desperately hard to be psychologically thrilling and subtle, while not being very psychological, thrilling,  or  subtle. The filmmakers are supposing that you won't be paying close enough attention to the opening two minutes that you'll miss the fact that they give away the ending at the very beginning, but they don't give the audience enough credit: twist endings are so common place nowadays that if a movie  opens  with several doctors talking about delusional mental illnesses, you already know what the twist is going to be as the movie goes through its overly obvious pacings. Further, the movie makes the bad decision of going on for ten minutes or so after the cat's out of the bag and the twist is revealed-- at that point, you're not surprised at what's happening, nor do you care. Ultimately, this movie had an interesting idea that was mired by the filmmakers assuming the audience had either never seen a psychological thriller before, or were idiots. And it's sad, because the directing is otherwise very well paced and the acting much better than movies of this sort tend to be, with a grade A cast (including John Cusack and Ray Liotta) and a script rich with character.   

 Usher's new song featuring Lil' Jon  Am I the only human being that thinks a man sweetly cooing about getting his ex-girlfriend back while another man randomly shouts "YEAH!" and "OKAAAAY!" in the background is about the dumbest fucking thing in the entire world? And this isn't the only song that suffers from this, either. There's some other R&B song on the radio right now, I don't remember who it's by, but it features that fucking useless mongoloid shouting "OKAY!" to an utterly inappropriate song. Folks, somewhere out there exists a small group of people profitting by making music of two-- sometimes three-- completely disparate elements that have nothing to do with one another, mixing them, and  profitting .  -----

        this entry brought to you by  the strokes, "last nite"  
note: this was originally written back in january, the day after the state of the union address. due to scribble's performance, I couldn't post it until february, and immediately afterward scribble went down for good. in order to afford you the chance to read it, I offer it again. If you're new to my page and don't know anything about Bushwhacker, well, it's not difficult to get the gist, now is it?  
  

   

Good evening, my fellow Americans of America. This is The Diabolical Bushwhacker, aka The Big Dub, aka Ferrari.   

Tonight, as I address the address on the state of the union, some of you might be asking yourselves, "Why 'Ferrari'? Why would he randomly choose the nickname 'Ferrari' for himself, and then mention it as if we were already referring to him as 'Ferrari'?" Well, I was listening to that funky-fresh song "Wanksta" by 50 Cent, and I figured, if he can do it, then surely I, the All Powerful Bushwhacker, can get in on a deal like that. But you know, I'm still The Bushwhacker to my homies. Don't be fooled by these Constitution-shredding Acts that I got. I'm still Dubya From The Block.  

Anyway, let Ferrari get back to the point he needs to make right  heesy  about this  addressizzle .  

Firstly, how do you all like that 20  billion  I'm planning on pulling out of already spiraling deficit for a mission to Mars that probably won't ever go anywhere concrete? It's probably resting  real easy  after that  87  billion  I asked Congress for to continue the  Wizzar  in Iraq that nobody in particular asked for. Didn't see  that  one coming, did you? Of course you didn't. Didn't mean it  stung  any less of course, but at least you you know that with this administration, every time my face shows up on the  telly , I'm probably going to be talking about billions upon billions of dollars I plan on spending needlessly. See? Being a Supervillain of Supervillianry proportions like ol' Ferrari doesn't mean you have to expect  devastating ,  crushing  blows, one right after another. Sometimes I like to soften the blow a little  softer  by letting you see it coming a mile away.  

But let me make a definite point here. Even when you're  the  Supervillain Extraordinare, 20  billion -- with a b!-- plus 87  billion  from a couple months ago isn't that easy to come by. Where the hell is all that money going to come from, you might be  axing  yourself. The answer, of course, is in giant tax hikes for the middle class-- what did you expect?  

However, I'm here to tell you today, it's not  just  about those crippling, yet predictable tax hikes. There are alternatives to milking your taxmonies dry to oil the well-funded pockets of the Military Machine and the people that profit from it. After much brainstorming, my administration has come up with a way to help fund the never-ending bloodshed in The Evil Part of the World, as  well as  stupid, superficial space plans that won't benefit anyone.  

And so, I present to you...  


   

THE JUICEWHACKER!  

That's right. The Bushwhacker is going to sell to  you  the ultimate in juicing technology, The Juicewhacker. With its three settings-- "Juice", "Juicier", and  "Juiciest" , it'll turn any household vegetable, fruit, or mineral that you can buy at the grocery store into the most delicious,  natural  drink money can buy.   

How much would you have to pay for a tall, cool glass of 100% orange juice from the grocery store? 75 dollars? 80? Folks, for the fancy,  designer  brand orange juice in your grocer's refringerated section, you could be paying  100 dollars , all for a gallon of juice. For one gallon!  

Not with the JUICEWHACKER! All it takes is a handful of any combination of natural produce to create a tall, cool, refreshing glass of your favorite juice substance.  

"But Bushwhacker!" I hear you saying. "How do I know this patented technology works?"  

Well, you don't have to take  my  word for it! Just look at the few lucky troops in the Middle East that aren't part of an ever-expanding, depressing heap of dead. They're required at least three glasses of juice from the JUICEWHACKER a day. It helps keep them energized, revitalized, with high morale, ready to take on Evil Doers day in and day out.  All you have to do is look at our results ! Just yesterday, we opened up one new school!! A new school! A school where they'll learn of The Great Bushwhacker, the Villain Who Saved Them From a Slightly Worse Villain, and will grow to love Americans and McDonald's French Fries and Mom's  apple pie ! I mean, you can't argue with that kind of hard evidence! At least, not until it gets blown up by "friendly fire" or a terrorist or something.  

How much would  you  pay for a wonderful, blessed-by-Jesus-himself juice-makin' machine like this? 86.7  billion dollars ?  

You can get this  revolutionary  machine ordered  directly to your door  for the low, low price of 71 monthly installments of $3,738! If you drink only 60 glasses of juice per day, in just  forty years  it'll pay for itself! Think of the savings!   

Listen folks, you might want to order this Juicewhacker. Not only is it patented and  Juice-a-licious , we're going to get the money from you whether it be  very slowly  from your paychecks, or through the 71 monthly installments. And this way, you get a handy-dandy juice machine instead of just a feeling that you've just been  violated . And not the  good  kind of violation, either!  

Good evening, and God bless. Respect to my homie Ash-C. Peace out.

       this entry brought to you by  radiohead, "pyramid song"   

Rule #1 to screwing up a reintroduction of a much-beloved, long running website: Promise to update daily, and then,  three days later , cease updating at all. This will ensure that anything resembling a returning reader will quickly forget about you and stop caring about whether you can or cannot get back in your supposed daily "groove".  

Reintroducing my webpage, however, wouldn't be much of a problem were the PC that I use to write words and ramblings not so riddled with disease and infection.  

Symptoms:  

* Constant, ass-raping advertisements that pop up that sometimes show up  even when the computer is not on-line .  

* Some malicious, unknown program  disabling  my pop-up blocker shortly after it is reinstalled.  

* Constant changing of my homepage to something called Coolfreesearch.biz-- when I initially log on, I right click on Internet Explorer and go to properties to change my homepage back to yahoo.com. Three minutes later when I decide to open up a second window to do a little multitasking,  it will have already changed  to coolfreesearch.biz.  

* Random sites that I try to go to are interrupted in midload by something called zestyfind.com, which tells me the site can't be found, despite being  in the middle of loading up  when I'm informed of this.  

* Sites that will have completed loaded up and I have been reading for five minutes will suddenly redirect to a 404 page, and when I try to click back, IE starts a series of crashes that end in a reboot.  

* At any point in time, I might be bumped off-line, at which time a mini-dialer starts to dial some long-distance (sometimes even international) number, and trying to disrupt this causes errors.  

* Perhaps worst of all, whatever malicious program is doing this  will try logging on even when the PC is off-line . That's right. We'll be off-line, in front of the TV, eating dinner, when the PC behind us will start dialing some random number somewhere.  

* Even worse than  that , not Add/Remove Programs, nor Ad-Aware, nor ZoneAlarm, nor Norton Anti-Virus, nor WinClean, nor anything else that we've tried that I can think of can get rid of it all, and if it  does  get rid of it, somehow it'll come right back one or two boot-ups later. I have had a program detect and delete something called dvldvr.exe almost every boot-up for approximately two months.  

In case you hadn't noticed, having your PC randomly boot you from whatever it is you're trying to do and then dial-up a porn number in Sweden, if not outright crash, is not exactly conductive of being able to post updates to an weblog daily.   

But!  

I might still be able to manage a semi-consistent schedule, because lately the computer has seemed somewhat stable, with only a few crashes or weird behavior over the past couple of days.  

If I disappear for a long period of time again, pray for me and my computer's soul. -----

 THE GOOD   

 Music on the radio  I don't mean to alarm you, but-- and this might 
not last long-- radio actually is  exciting  again. No, not just 
tolerable,  exciting , dammit. A few months ago, really, really cruddy, 
whiney, annoying emo music was ruling alternative radio, and it seemed like it 
was going to stay like that for the forseeable future. But then suddenly The 
White Stripes are radio darlings, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs are being played more 
than the new Puddle of Mudd, and since when the hell did Muse start getting 
played? Throw in heavy rotation for Modest Mouse, The Shins, The Von 
Bondies, The Killers, Jet,  and a ton of other  really great  bands on 
top of that list, and it creates a world-- some sort of alternative 
universe-- where radio is actually  exciting  again. Pardon my 
enthusiasm, but when was the last time you turned on the radio and listened 
for more than a half hour and liked most of what you heard?  

  urlLink Ren & Stimpy action figures   I know some people were really overly upset about the whole "gay" thing on Spike TV's attempt at ressurrecting Ren & Stimpy. I personally never caught it since I didn't have cable, but I honestly don't think it would've bothered me seeing as how they're a  cat and a freaking dog . No matter what, though,  no matter what , even if Spike TV's relaunch utterly ruined Ren & Stimpy for you forever, you can't pretend you wouldn't want a plastic Mr. Horse with which to do your best "No sir, I don't like it" impersonation.  

  urlLink The new Street Fighter 2 Toys from SOTA   Actually, there were some really kick-ass SF2 toys introduced back in like, 1999 from JAKKs, and those were a smidge better than these, but really, one can't get enough Street Fighter 2 merchandise, can one? Especially when all one wants is more Chun Li toys to play with, and the SOTA ones  urlLink are pretty darned good .  

  urlLink Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVD   If you've never caught Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim it's a bit difficult to describe, because unlike most other conventional animated shows like The Simpsons, The Family Guy, or even Invader Zim, the animation budget is so low there's no real action and only the barist semblence of a plot. In fact, there aren't even all that many  gags  in the conventional sense: most of the show's humor comes from the interaction of the characters, which mostly comes down to Master Shake being a total asshole, Meatwad being a sweet-natured but naive near-retard, and Frylock having to put up with them because, though a genius, he's a giant, floating carton of fries.  So really, describing it kinda sells it short. Suffice it to say it's random, surreal, a great parody of bad 80's cartoons, and just fricking  hilarious ; you should buy it if you're a fan of "the funny"   

 Invader Zim DVD  I've seen all the episodes already because we downloaded them over a year ago, but it's still great to be able to have them on  DVD  (and for such a low price!), and to be able to see them in picture-perfect quality. Looking at them again, I still think the shocking part of Invader Zim wasn't that it was cancelled by Nickelodeon, but that it was ever picked up in the first place. It's been a long time since Ren & Stimpy was on the air, folks, and even that show Nick didn't seem to like too much. But at least Ren & Stimpy's main character was just psychotic-- Zim, on the other hand, is bona fide  evil , and how're you going to try and program it on a station that has Rugrats and that one cartoon about little kids that are extreme skaters?    


 THE BAD   

  urlLink Sydney   I don't really know what to write here, except that I know a girl named Lori, and her daughter, Sydney, is living her last days, and I would like for her to be in your thoughts before she goes.  

 The Worship of Ronald Reagan's corpse  Because I wasn't updating my page at the time, you got to escape my annoyance over Reagan's death when it happened, but the fact that it's not current news  never  stops me from a tirade. Look, when the man died, he was  ninety three freaking years old . I understand that he was a great man to a lot of people, and in fact, he was the most important man in the entire world for eight entire years. So I understand that the media would spend some time covering his death. But the entire week-long  media blackout  of otherwise perfectly neccesary news to cover the death of an  extremely old man  was not only freaking unneccesary, it bordered on ghoulish. I mean, did we  really  need a federal day of rememberence in honor of a  dead ninety-three year old man ? Am I the only one that felt like this event was used politically as a bit of dog-wagging? You know, whip up the whole country into a patriotic, tear-jerked  fervor  to ignore all sorts of  real life  shit, like the burgeoning Abu Ghairab incidents? Did we  really  need to get my wife's pay check a day later, did I  really  need to not get any mail, did I  really  need to not see any other interesting news because  an old man died ? He lived longer than American life expectancy! This was not a damned tragedy! If he was killed when he was shot in the eighties,  that  would've been a tragedy. But he outlived  most Americans ! And the fact that magazines had 16-page tributes to him  two days later  seemed as if they'd had their articles written months in advance. One more thing before I shut up about this: Ronald Reagan did not single handedly destroy communism! The citizens of communist countries who'd had  enough of the crap  kinda had a helping hand in it too, you know!  

 Avril Lavigne  Listen, I don't care that she writes her own songs, I don't care how much or how little punk she is, I don't care about how much she's shaking things up, all I know is Avril Lavigne fucking annoys me. At least Britney Spears doesn't pretend she  isn't  vapid and useless, and at least she doesn't pick fights with really easy pop targets like Avril does with Hillary Duff. Also, she's  not  punk, not even a little, and she's not skater, either.  

 Missing Entries  You know what sucks? I actually got several readers really excited about my reintroduction, and were happy I was starting over again. They  wanted  fresh, new words and ramblings. Then I stop updating three days later. Now I don't think  anybody  is reading this anymore. So I really  am  starting anew. Blargh.  

 Right-wing reaction to Farenheit 9/11  You know, I don't recall anyone ever starting up websites and "grassroots" efforts to stop the lies and bullshit from books by Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, and Bill O'Reilly. Turnabout's fair play, assholes.  -----

       this entry brought to you by  sleater-kinney, "you're no rock n' roll fun"   


The following is an actual email I sent to my former supervisor on February, Friday 13. That's right,  Friday the thirteenth . It's a little long, but it's a really interesting, albeit somewhat scary story that you ought to read.   

 Ed,  

This isn't the email you expected to get from me, I know, but considering what's been going on at work past couple days, I thought I should at least give you a heads up.   

Friday, Nick showed up almost an hour late. Which made us all upset because when he wasn't there by 3:15 we assumed he wasn't going to come in at all-- wishful thinking.   

It was weird, because after I finished stocking Health and Beauty, I went up to lock-ups where Matt and Chris Wilson were, and I said, "I just came by to ask you if I'm the only one that thinks if Nick gets fired, he'll come back the next day and shoot everyone." Matt and Chris smiled in that "this is eery" kind of way-- turns out the reason Chris Wilson was talking to Matt was to find out what Matt thought of Nick, and Matt replied that we all hated him, but if he got fired he'd return and kill us all. It was funny, yet uncomfortable that all three of us were probably thinking the same thing at the exact same time.   

...Turns out maybe we're not so far from the truth.   

About an hour later, at 6, Nick and Jose start fighting. Not fist fighting, but... This is how I worded it later to my wife. You know when you're out in public, maybe at a park, maybe near a street basketball court, and you hear a group of grown men right before a fight? You know the noise men make right before fists start flying, the looks they get in their eyes, the way they puff themselves up? Two things can happen right at this moment; either the two of them will start fighting, or someone breaks them up because everyone has this internal instinct that this is what's right about to happen. This whole time I'm right next to them trying to get them to cool down, saying, look, we'll listen to 92.3 until 7-- that's right, another damned argument about the radio-- and from that point til 8 we'll listen to Jose's station, but it's as if I wasn't there, it was as if Nick  wanted  to fight Jose. They were calling each other horrible names, and Ed, I honestly thought I'd have to break apart two grown men from fighting because I'm standing right there.   

At one point during the most heated part of the shout-match, me right in between, Nick says to Jose, "So, I guess you never had your stuff pushed in?" That's right. In those words.  Stuff .  

The whole time I'm trying to break these two up, and when he says this suddenly I'm just taken aback, as was Jose. There was a pause in the air, and Jose and I both let out a " What? " simoultaneously. In hindsight, it was definitely the most bafflingly hysterical thing any man could threaten or insult another man with, especially considering Nick's only 5'3" and Jose's got a good foot on him.   

"What're you, a fucking fag?" Jose retorted after Nick repeated what he'd said. I would expect  that sort of response from a monkey like Jose, and I knew  exactly  how Nick would react, seeing as how he'd been fueling this fight from the get-go.  

Nick froze, his eyes widened. "... What  did you just call me?" Nick asked.  

I knew what was going to happen next, and I felt like whatever I did wouldn't stop it, and I could feel myself shrinking away back into the aisle that was closest to me. I wanted to be as far away from all this as possible.  

Jose finally turned around with a "Fuck you, man, forget you," and walked away, and Nick-- and I'm standing maybe five feet away from him at this point-- got this look on his face as if he were unsatisfied with the outcome of the argument, that it indeed was  not  over for him, and he  darted -- he made a freaking bee-line-- over to his jacket, and pulled something out of his pocket, which he shoved underneath his shirt.   

...Ed, you know there's only one of two things a man will reach into his jacket pocket for immediately after a heated argument, and neither of them are good. I guarantee you he wasn't whipping out a poetry book to write down how angry he was. I thought he was going to shoot Jose right in front of me.   

...He tucks it into his shirt and he looks up at me-- we'd made eye contact maybe three times as he ran up to his jacket to get whatever it was, as if deciding whether it was worth doing in front of me or not, deciding it was worth it because maybe I'm too afraid of him to tell or whatever the hell was his thinking-- he tucked it into his shirt and looked up at me and gave me this dirty look, as if it were understood that I'd better keep this exchange to myself.   

After much internal debating, I told Judd about five minutes later-- I had to take a walk around the store a couple times to cool myself off, and also to decide what the hell to do. I wouldn't have even hesitated if he didn't freaking see me watching this exchange, but he looked right up at me, he knew I knew what was about to happen. And if I were to tell, I didn't want this guy after me for snitching. But on the other hand, I couldn't stand it if I had known this all along and Jose got shot or stabbed.   

...Long story short, nothing happened. After I told Judd, he went and checked out how things were going, didn't mention anything to them that he knew about what I'd told him, said he didn't see anything under Nick's shirt, which simply means that Nick put it back-- maybe it's because he knew I was standing there watching him.   

But it gets slightly worse. Nick and Jose continued to argue fiercely and loudly throughout the rest of the day, and Nick left at 8:30, without any explanation to Judd, telling only Will, "I don't need this shit anymore."   

For job abandonment, Judd told the operator to call him and tell him not to come back until you contacted him.   

End of that, right?   

He showed up this morning at 3:00am sharp, asking, "Where the fuck is Ed?"   

Judd told him that you weren't there. Nick said, and I'm quoting here, "I've got a couple bones to pick with Ed."   

To make matters even worse, I got confirmation from Joey that it was indeed a gun. I know Joey's a lying sack of shit, but the way it was brought up in conversation I know he wasn't lying about it.   

On Saturday, Joey, who wasn't there on Friday, asked what happened to Nick, since he was supposed to be there that day. I informed him that Nick had been fired.   

"What, because of the gun?" Joey asked jokingly. I looked at him with a "How in the hell did you know?" face, and his eyes widened and his face turned white. Turns out Nick and he were talking about how Joey lives in a bad neighborhood, and Nick offered to sell his spare gun, which he said he had on him. Joey assumed it was bullshit, because Nick's the kind of wanna-be thug trying to make himself look tough. Joey took it as a joke. When I told him everything that happened on Friday, he got really scared and nervous. Again, Joey's a lying sack of crap most of the time, but he brought up the gun thing before I ever mentioned it.  

...I don't want to get you paranoid or anything. Maybe Monday will go by without incident. But I know Nick had a weapon on him on Friday, and intended to use it-- he either decided it wasn't worth it, or didn't because he knew I'd seen him, but the point is this maniac had a weapon on him  at work , and now that he's been told not to come back to work, he wants to speak to you.   

Maybe nothing will happen, but jeez Ed, I would never forgive myself if he did something we're all going to regret on Monday and I didn't warn you, knowing what I know. Security is aware of him and what happened, Judd and I were told that head of security would check the camera tapes, but it's Target security for Chris'sakes. I don't trust them to secure  anything .   

So, basically what I'm saying is, be warned, that psycho little shit might show up at work on Monday with intentions other than to just talk to you. And he was there 3am  sharp  this morning, so he was trying to catch you before you got in. As it is, I myself am incredibly hesitant to go in on Monday, considering I'm the one that alerted everybody to him, and while he doesn't know who knows other than me, I'm sure he could figure it out himself that I'd tell someone.   

--Chris  -----    

 While Nick never returned and shot up the joint, he  did  call three or four times threatening to kick Ed and Judd's ass, and here's another quote-- "Straight up start some shit." When asked exactly what he meant by "starting some shit", Nick replied icily, "You know what I mean."  

...And guess what? Nick just moved into my apartment complex a couple weeks ago. I see him about once a week. For joy!

I haven't decided what to call this. I'm thinking about calling it simply "Blue", and while that fits the refrain, I don't know if it fits the theme of the poem. -----   

Because birth is sold like it's ergonomic 
You could test it with basic arithmetic 
Like a little salt poured over a sifting pan 
Quickly replaced by Fool's Gold sand  

I'd like to talk to you at length about history 
The boring, ever-growing old story 
The birds and the bees make the same mistakes 
I'd beg to differ, but I can't fight off all the fakes  

Because you're still new 
You'll have less explaining to do 
But hold your breath until you're blue 
Keep holding your breath until you're blue  

There's a really bad song I can't remember right now 
About signs of the times and the lost and the found 
Trying to grow up with all the bad news can be hard 
Empty terrorist threats can leave you apathetically scarred  

I'd have a word with them all but we've had a falling out 
With or without them all I still can have crippling doubt 
Could promise a journey to the promised land 
Make it one-way and hire me a helping hand  

Because you're still new 
You'll have less explaining to do 
But try again until you're blue 
Keep trying again until you're blue -----

I'm comfortable enough with my sexuality and in my manhood that I could be okay with being number 2, number 10, or hell, even number 50 in a 500-person gangbang, but what the hell is number 478 thinking? -----
