        Those s'cool girls songs stick in your head like ribs in your belly sometimes. I started singing L-E-T-S G-O quietly and pretty soon several 8-year olds caught on and started to sing too. There you have it. Another s'cool day.

        Okay, So I know I've been kind of invisible lately, doing behind the scenes Teenacide work..but expect to see me around town real soon! You may have already caught me last nite at the Teenacide viewing party for Godzilla at the Nuart. That's right, last night I made a special appearance at the Nuart. NO, I wasn't searching for one of the Laurens...Although you should buy their record as soon as it hits the shelf..anyways..decked out in my "I will Destroy You" tee by Tom Neeley, I watched Godzirra destroy Tokyo alongside Teenacide's elite.   Well that's it for now!  xxteentern

        In celebration of the Checkers nomination for "Best New Artist", I put on my spikiest 4 inch heels and headed down to the Henry Fonda with Jim. Upon our arrival, we spotted George from the Checkers and headed inside where we were showered with free Stoli..(wink!).  There were lots of shiny booths there like tattoos and free hairstyling and amoeba..    Suddenly, I got some hair goop stuck on my hands..Heads turned as I squealed..until this guy took it off and put it on his mohawk. I realized that hair styling should be left to professionals only. So I let this cool girl named Cazzie style my hair while the suicide girls were on. Those suicide girls have a van you know. It is silver with SG on the side..I thought it stood for s'cool girls..but I guess not. Anyway, we headed for the balcony where we began our evening of being kicked out of places. I got kicked out of at least 6 different places.Oh and the Like's lead singer gave me the skunk eye.  So after they kicked me off the roof for the second time..we decided to head out and look for better trouble.   P.S. If you are wondering what else I was wearing besides heels..you'll have to look for me in the weekly.

      Okay camping at the beach and surfing all weekend..life seriously doesn't get much better! I spent my weekend in a gyspy camp on a bluff overlooking the sea..joined by Teenacide's own Janet Housdon, my rock n roll mama, betsy cuttlefish the mermaid, stitch and capn morgan, we took on the surf and had a blast.  You should try it. Better yet..you should join us next time.

      That's right. Surfing was ranked number 3 (next to Softball and boogie boarding) as Teenacide enthusiasts' favorite sport! I'll be catching waves all weekend and listening to my copy of "Too Hot to be Bothered." Did I mention I'm camping out right on the beach too?! Times like these require a summer van..  xxteenternxx
