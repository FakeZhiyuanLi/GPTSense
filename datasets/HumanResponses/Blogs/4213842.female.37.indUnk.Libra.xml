      Well I finally did it, after 10 years I finally finished the first chapter of a story. nothin big, something I have been meaning to do for along time. More for my friends then to be published, I read it over 15 times, spell checked it 6 times then mailed it out.  Funny thing is I was not as nervous as I thought I would have been. I had a really nice day yesterday, it stated with a call at 8am, my sister in law was in the hospital in labor. By 2:45 pm a wonderful 8lb baby girl was born. So of course I rushed to the hospital to see them.  a great day indeed...   Ana

      Well Let me start at the bagning, Last December when my husband woke me to get ready for graveyard shift at the vets home I was working at. He did as he always did, he layed our then 2 mounth old baby girl in my arms. to my terror I was unable to feel her or use my left side at all. We rushed to the hospitail thinking i had a stroke, thankfully after exstensive testing that was not what had happened. But they had found exstensive damage to the left side of my brain, after seeing four differant doctors, they finnally told me I had a blood clot rupture 4yrs ago. they still do not know why i lost the use of parts of my body. Due to finaces and Health and Welfare denieing me help, I have been unable to see a doctor in several months. So each day I wake up in pain, prying that I will make it just alittle longer. Unfortantly the past few months I have been lossing memories of my childhood, my short term memorie no longer works. If I dont write it down I forget in what feels like 1 minute. But threw it all I have found out who is Really a friend, yes I have lost alot of people who said they would always be there, but I am sure we all have. My husband, my best friend has been at my side threw it all, i know it is so hard on him. looking at the woman who was so full of life, now unable to do all the things she loves to do. But he is my hero and always will be, and my babies who look up to me still, even when I can't hold them as much as i want, or play ball.  A dear friend told me of this place, a woman I have come to admire threw the years. a pillar in her own right. Strong and so kind to those around her. She keeps me pushing for the next day, even tho we only talk online, I would like to shake her hand someday. Well now I struggle more each day to be as normail as I can, trying not to worrie about the small stuff to much.  I will always keep going as long as I can. thank you Xannie pooh.  Ana
