      This last weekend was my first pride ever.  It was a blast.  I went to the VIP party on Saturday night, met and chatted with many folks.  Went out to a club on Saturday night, danced a bit skankily (oops), and then got up for brunch on Sunday at Chuck and Wayne's house in Midtown.   Afterwards, they took me to the parade lineup, and I marched with Gerogia Equality (georgiaequality.org) and then I watched the remainder of the parade.  While watching the parade, a ridiculous downpour occured, bringing the already 2+ hour parade to an end.  There had to have been at least a 100 thousand people at the event and I loved every second of it.  Next year, I intend to volunteer.   Over the next few weeks, I am going to begin getting involved in the community.  I will hopefully meet with various charity people and see where I might best fit.   Okay, time to workout and head to work (may I please make some money, please, please, please!!!).

      I spoke last night at the Atlanta Executive Network about my experience at Baylor.  The event energizes me even further to fight for our civil rights.    I lost the next to last page of the speech, but otherwise I think it went really well.  There were a lot of supportive folks there.   If you care to watch any of the speech, the edited (5 minutes) video can be found at http://www.aen.org/flash/0406..html.

      For the first time ever, I was stood up last night!  It really hurt, too.  Hell, it was just a date, but I don't like being disrespected in this way.  I will give him a chance to explain, but still, it was mighty thoughtless to not even call and tell me he couldn't come.  I got all dressed up for the prom and ended up not going!    Darrin and I talked about it a bit.  I have always been insecure about my looks and personality.  This insecurity is quite silly, according to everyone who knows me.  I think it stems from such a shitty home life.    I know I need to move past this "fat girl" complex...the complex where you believe you are always ugly and no one will ever love you.  I am a great catch, I just sometimes have problems believing that.  I also resolved I am not going to lower my standards just because of being stood up once.    I've got a whole hell of a lot going for me.  Okay, enough of the personal pep talk.  I will confront this guy about this (since I work with him).  Too bad he was thoughtless--he was really cute.    As for me, I have found my prayers changing a bit.  I used to pray for a hot guy to enter my life.  Now I pray for a thoughtful, integrity-filled, loving guy (who is hot).  I still want a hot guy, but that's moved down a bit on the priority list.  Not just any hot guy will be allowed to date me.  Looks like I will be turning down a bunch of date requests!  Okay, now back to speech mode.   EQUAL RIGHTS , baby!

      As always, I am a bit scared by the prospect of all this.  I am also extremely excited.  I hope that I can motivate and inspire individuals to fight for our civil rights.  I should be allowed the freedom to be myself without punishment.  As it is, our society is attempting to shut down any hope of a better future for homosexuals.  I just want to get married and have children.  I just want the promise of genuine and real love.  God let it be!    Okay, time to practice my speech again!

      I ran into a Baylor alum at the restaurant last weekend.  He was with his partner, who is a good friend of the VP of Student Financial Affairs at Emory (or whatever his real title, he's the VP who oversees the money I need to attend school in the fall!).  They've agreed to put me in touch with him.  Don't know what will come of it, but I look forward to the possibilities!

      Here it is!  My first post --- I think I am going to use this to keep my friends updated on what's going on, and as a bit of a public/personal diary of my life.    I have settled into my temporary housing, but it's likely to become my permanent home for the next few months.  My apartment is on the 16th floor, overlooks downtown, Midtown and Buckhead (where all the skyscrapers are) and the Emory University Campus.  With all the trees, I don't see the clutter that comes with a city, so, I have an incredibly beautiful view of the city!  All bills included, I think I will be paying $400 a month for it--a real steal!    Yesterday, I spoke with a highly respected professor here at the Graduate School of Religion who wants me to be his research assistant.  More news to come, but suffice it to say that the old Baylor Tyrants (may they lose their jobs since they've compromised any right to lead) will be happy to hear the news!  More importantly, his areas of research interest me deeply, and his students have a reputation for going far.  Maybe this whole "teaching" and "research" dream I have will actually happen?   Time to bring in the big bucks as a waiter.
