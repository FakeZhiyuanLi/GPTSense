      I saw   urlLink The Village   last night, and although I was a bit disappointed, the film&nbsp;creates some&nbsp;issues to chew on.&nbsp; If you haven't seen the movie and do not want&nbsp;it spoiled, I recommend not reading any further, as it will be difficult for me to&nbsp;offer my thoughts on this one without exposing some of the&nbsp;plot's mysteries.   Aside from some nice  urlLink photography  and expectedly good performances from  urlLink William Hurt  and  urlLink Joaquin Phoenix , the movie seemed scattered, especially for the first two-thirds of its running time.&nbsp; There were several moments during this&nbsp;longish beginning stretch that I was really itching for the plot to begin.&nbsp; When it finally did, I must admit that I wasn't all that enthralled with finding out what would happen.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I was no longer quite as frustrated&nbsp;after the story finally started coming together.&nbsp; Now, some may object to all of that, claiming that the whole point to the movie is to keep people guessing and wondering about the film's direction, which crescendos  urlLink M. Night Shyamalan -style with a twist at the end.&nbsp; But when compared to   urlLink The Sixth Sense  , the end "twist" didn't really strike me as a twist at all, but more as a revealing of who the creatures were,&nbsp;why the village existed, and a justification&nbsp;of the poor attempts at colonial-era dialogue that periodically plaugued much of the first half.&nbsp; Shyamalan is known for his unexpected finishes, but what was revealed at the end of this film left something to be desired.&nbsp; It's one thing for a movie to have a mind-blowing twist at the end if the story has directly built up to it and the final revelation has substance&nbsp;(as in  The Sixth Sense ), but if the ending barely exposes why you had to sit through scattered scenes and&nbsp;cryptic&nbsp;exchanges between characters for&nbsp;1.5 hours, it leaves me wondering, "What's the point?"&nbsp;&nbsp;Although scatteredness&nbsp;isn't necessarily bad if the ending makes it worthwhile, this&nbsp;finish didn't accomplish that, at least for me.&nbsp; It seemed that&nbsp;Shyamalan's goals were&nbsp;only to&nbsp;startle the audience at various points&nbsp;and to utilize&nbsp;surprise-story-telling&nbsp;devices within a rather&nbsp;weak story.&nbsp; (I'm sure&nbsp;a weak story wasn't his goal however).&nbsp;These&nbsp;goals aren't bad in and of themselves, but when coupled with a&nbsp;story- quaesitum&nbsp;no deeper than the creation of a communal utopia to protect your children from the big, bad world, it becomes&nbsp;nothing more than a&nbsp;film exercise.&nbsp; This all seems a bit harsh, but I think I'm biased against the idea of going to extremes to&nbsp;shield children from the world's depravity.&nbsp; While I don't believe kids should be immersed in evil, there's something about creating a false world in order to preserve their innocence that doesn't settle right with me, which is why I didn't enjoy   urlLink Life Is Beautiful  &nbsp; much either.&nbsp; You can create the fallacious community, but&nbsp;when the&nbsp;sin still follows you there, how do you explain&nbsp;the hoax&nbsp;to&nbsp;the lab-test subjects?&nbsp; I don't think evil should be dwelt upon, but it must be recognized to arrive at the truth about the world.&nbsp;  While not a horrible movie,&nbsp; The Village  left me wanting something more.&nbsp; 5/10

      John Kerry, Jan. 23, 2003: &nbsp;"Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real..."   John Kerry, July 29, 2004: "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so."   Don' t you just&nbsp;love it when you nail yourself?

      So, the Democommie convention is under way, and while I could probably fill pages with vitriolic diatribes combatting the lies, I'll just keep this&nbsp;short and humorous (I hope).&nbsp; The title links to an article about various happenings on Monday, and I found a comment from Jimbo a bit ridiculous.&nbsp; Attempting to inspire fear in the electorate by claiming that we can't fight terrorism without the aid of such massive military behemoths like France, Carter claimed: "Unilateral acts and demands have isolated the United States from the very nations we need to join us in combatting terrorism."&nbsp; "Unilateral"?&nbsp; Although the anti-war crowd loves to bandy about this term, I don't think they understand its definition.&nbsp; The prefix "uni-" means "one", or "single".&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm discombobulated as to how the U.S., U.K., Poland, Spain, Estonia, Italy, the Ukraine, Bulgaria, Latvia, the Netherlands, Hungary and other countries going to war together is "unilateral".&nbsp; How disrespectful to the international community for Jimmy&nbsp;to act as though their assistance in Iraq is nonexistent...

      Here is the first part of my China mission trip report, in which details are provided about our first week in Hong Kong.&nbsp; Writing this brought back a flood of memories from the trip, which caused me to want to return even more!   Departure and Arrival.&nbsp; 7/2-3  I had never flown before this trip.&nbsp; Growing up, I was afraid to fly, but there was never a moment on the plane to Chicago that I was scared.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;I remember feeling a little weird after the&nbsp;bird took off because there was nothing solid connecting me to the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The views were spectacular.&nbsp;We arrived at O'Hare and had some time to kill after checking in with United, so we went to McD's to enjoy some American grease.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The plane to HK for our 15 hour non-stop flight was a 747.&nbsp; I had an aisle seat in coach with an empty seat between me and team member Erin, while&nbsp;Kevin was next to me across the aisle&nbsp;with Kathleen.&nbsp; I enjoyed taking off and experiencing the power of such a huge machine.&nbsp; The food on the flight was&nbsp;ho ho mei (delicious),&nbsp;&nbsp;but after about 6-7 hours, I began to get a bit antsy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I passed the time in various fashions:&nbsp; playing&nbsp;Planet Hollywood trivia (me, Megan and Erin were on a team against&nbsp;Kevin and Kathleen - we destroyed them easily), and&nbsp;playing Phase 10 with Erin and Megan (Erin destroyed us easily).&nbsp; I also talked with Megan for&nbsp;quite sometime, and&nbsp;then watched movies: Miracle (rocks! 7/10), Jersey Girl (pretty good 6/10) and&nbsp;The Mexican (the last film shown on the flight; I was very tired and did not enjoy it 4/10)&nbsp;.&nbsp; We arrived at the HK airport, got our bags, and met up with Greg Mosby&nbsp;(full time missionary in HK) and some university students that he disciples.&nbsp; Katie M. was also already there.&nbsp; We got a quick bite at McD's again, then walked to the bus that would take us to the camp at which we&nbsp;would stay while in HK.&nbsp; On the bus I met university&nbsp;students&nbsp;David and Allan.&nbsp; The first thing I said to Allan was "How's it goin'?"&nbsp; Greg&nbsp;immediately informed me that my quick, colloquial remarks would not fly; I must speak more slowly and use simple English.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp;We talked about our majors (Allan's is building management), movies, and other things I don't recall.  The camp is not really a camp as in tents, fires, and s'mores, but more of a dormitory setting on top of a hill called High Rock,&nbsp;up which we had to trudge with our heavy bags in the stifling humidity.&nbsp; And I also had the fun of toting Ross' bag-o-bricks, since he was in Chicago scrambling to replace his lost passport.&nbsp; With the help of David and Allan,&nbsp;Kevin and I&nbsp;got settled in our room, which was about 10' x 7' with two bunks.&nbsp; AC on high; didn't sleep much due to youths being rowdy outside for a good chunk of the night.  &nbsp;  Tai Wai Church 7/4  On Independence Day (at least in the States),&nbsp;we walked down the rock and had breakfast at "Oscar Restaurant" - think Denny's, just dirtier.&nbsp; I actually ate a very tasty egg and ham sandwich that I bought at a bread shop across from Oscar.&nbsp; We then headed to Cheng Wing Gee College , where the Tai Wai Church holds services in an assembly hall.&nbsp; Click here to see a picture:  urlLink http://photos1.blogger.com/img/277/1323/640/Dscn0068.jpg   The singing was in Cantonese, but we could sing along to one song in English.&nbsp; Kevin then preached on&nbsp;2 Cor 5:11-21, with Pastor Stephen translating into Cantonese.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a&nbsp;good sermon about why our team had come to China: to reconcile the lost to God.&nbsp; We then had lunch at the school with various Tai Wai church members, and I got my first taste of authentic Chinese food.&nbsp; It was pretty good!&nbsp; I remember eating a tasty&nbsp;omelet casserole and also&nbsp;trying a dragon's eye, which is a type of fruit similar to grapes - not bad, but one was enough for me.&nbsp; I enjoyed meeting various people active in the church, including Johnny, who I believe is involved in the music ministry.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Presentation 7/5  On Monday, we traveled to Chuk Sau Yuen Primary School to give our presentation.&nbsp; This involved the powerpoint show I made about the U.S., and&nbsp;teaching the kids (elementary age) simple English songs such as "Head, Shoulders, Knees & Toes", "Jesus Loves Me" and "Father Abraham".&nbsp; I stepped aside for that last one.&nbsp; We also performed a short skit, in which I played the victim in the Good Samaritan story.&nbsp; However, we updated it to take place in modern day Hong Kong along Victoria Harbor, since mentioning "Samaritans" and "Levites" would have undoubtedly resulted in blank stares from the students.&nbsp; Ross and Katie H. jumped me, Lori and Kathleen passed me by, and Erin was the Good Sam, all to Megan's translated narration. (By the way, Ross arrived&nbsp;safely on Sunday&nbsp;with some funny stories about his passport debacle).&nbsp; Tip for those of you planning on doing something like this for young kids: don't have a male and female come within each other's personal space during the skit, as all of the kids started screaming and laughing when Erin helped me up!&nbsp; They thought we were&nbsp;in love...&nbsp;The presentation also featured some hilarious dancing by Kevin and Lori in&nbsp;dog and chicken hats to such obnoxious tunes as "Who Let the Dogs Out?" and "The Chicken Dance Song" (I'm not sure if that's what it's called, but you know what I mean). &nbsp;Megan gave a quick testimony to round out the show.&nbsp;  urlLink Here's a picture of the students to whom we presented.   Now, I'm not sure if we had lunch with teachers at Cheng Weng Gee this day or not, but I'll mention it&nbsp;since I've mentioned it.&nbsp; Many of the teachers at CWGC are overworked and frazzled, so we had lunch with them, encouraged them&nbsp;and sang worship songs.&nbsp; It was a good time, and while speaking with some of the them, I learned that they do not watch Chinese films as they are "poor quality".&nbsp; They mentioned liking  The Day After Tomorrow , and &nbsp; I had to hold my tongue&nbsp;from saying&nbsp;that it's poor quality too.&nbsp;  Anyway, I slept better Monday night thanks to some sleeping pills of Katie M.'s   HK City Tour 7/6  Tuesday morning I had an opportunity for&nbsp;a quiet time of prayer and Bible reading.&nbsp; I went&nbsp; to the courtyard outside our room,&nbsp;and for 45 minutes prepared&nbsp;spiritually and tried to&nbsp;relax.&nbsp; We arrived at CWGC, ate breakfast, and then each American was assigned to a group of&nbsp;five to six Form-6&nbsp;Chinese students who would take them on a tour of&nbsp;Hong Kong.&nbsp; &nbsp;Form-6 six students are 17-18 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;I greeted my group, and we boarded buses to take us to our first destination: a  urlLink Buddhist temple .&nbsp; My students showed me around the temple, explaining the fruit offerings in front of idols and why people went there to pray.&nbsp; (Most apparently pray for more money and better life-situations).&nbsp; Three of my students (Roy, Edwin, and&nbsp;Raymond) are Christians, so they do not believe that the activities at the temple are legitimate, and the other students claimed to have no beliefs.&nbsp;  Next, we traveled to a  urlLink Taoist temple , where three main religious practices took place.&nbsp; Many people  urlLink burned incense and prayed  in the center courtyard, while others circled around a fountain&nbsp;and attempted to touch the "holy" water in order to become righteous.&nbsp; There was a small booth near the entrance to the temple where patrons could purchase incense and other items to offer as sacrifices to idols.&nbsp; Also available at the booth were cups full of small wooden sticks with numbers on them.&nbsp; The idea is to shake the cup until a stick falls out, then take that stick to a fortune teller to receive some sort of prognostication.&nbsp;  The purpose of this&nbsp;tour was for the American visitors to interact with Chinese students of varying beliefs, and share the gospel with those who were not Christians.&nbsp; After visiting the Taoist temple, we boarded the bus and began traveling to Mong Kok (downtown HK) for lunch and shopping.&nbsp; On the way, I had a good conversation with Terry about why I believe in Christ even though I can't physically see him.&nbsp; Terry asked good questions and was very open to talking about spiritual things, and I was also able to share the gospel with him.&nbsp;Although Terry was&nbsp;unwilling to believe,&nbsp;having this conversation made me feel that the trip was fruitful.&nbsp;  For the rest of the morning and afternoon, I spent time with the students shopping, talking, and having an excellent lunch of chicken curry and rice&nbsp;in a mall.&nbsp; I was especially touched when the students presented gifts to me: a set of marble chopsticks and some Chinese hand-exercise orbs(I'm not sure what the&nbsp;technical name of latter is).&nbsp; Around dinner time, we parted company with our students and decided to grab a bite to eat and head back to the camp.&nbsp; This day was especially good for me because my students were great guys, and because of my conversation with Terry.&nbsp; For good measure,  urlLink here's a picture &nbsp;I took on the tour&nbsp;of a street corner in downtown HK.   Presentation/small groups 7/7  Wednesday was one of our busiest ministry days.&nbsp; The main activity was a presentation to two sets of Form-4 (middle school)&nbsp;to Form-6 students, in which&nbsp;we again utilized the power point show and sang some songs.&nbsp; Next, each American got in a group&nbsp;with 6-8 students and conducted discussions in English about Chinese and American culture.&nbsp; This also provided opportunities for spiritual discussions, and I was pleased to share the gospel with both of my groups.&nbsp; At night, we met with a&nbsp;sizeable group of university students, many of whom would travel with us to Zhongshan.&nbsp; We ate pizza, sang some songs, and had a Bible study.&nbsp; It was a good time, but when finished, I was ready to hit the hay!&nbsp; I've never been so tired in all my life; I started to fall asleep standing up!   The Peak 7/8  Thursday was a free day, and we took full advantage.&nbsp; We traveled to Hong Kong Island via ferry, which was a good&nbsp;opportunity for some nice pictures of the  urlLink city .&nbsp; On the island, we took a perilous bus ride&nbsp;(very windy, narrow roads)&nbsp; on a double-decker&nbsp;to Stanley Market and Beach.&nbsp; Some in our group, including me, wanted to go swimming, so while doing that, others shopped.&nbsp; It was very refreshing to take a cool dip in the midst of the Hong Kong heat.&nbsp; Next, we joined the rest of the group, spent some time shopping, then headed to the Peak for dinner and a  urlLink nice view of HK .&nbsp; After enjoying some pizza and a&nbsp;ho ho mei crepe&nbsp;with ice cream,&nbsp;I went back up to the observation deck for some night shots.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most of my&nbsp;pics&nbsp;are not suitable for public viewing (due to poor quality), but  urlLink here is one  that barely&nbsp;passes muster.&nbsp; Finally, we took the train back to the camp, made a few preparations for our travel to Zhongshan, and went to bed.

      The above links to an op-ed by Frank Rich of the slightly biased NYT.&nbsp; What frightens me is not so much his take on the new  urlLink movie  or its possible effects, but how he paints the Bush admin. as a utilizer of fear in order to maintain power.&nbsp; While I don't totally agree that the tactics Rich details are actually being used to the extent in which he details them, I do sense that Bush's campaign has adopted a more negative tone compared to 2000.&nbsp; That's not good, because I believe part of the reason Bush won in 2000 is because he took the high ground in the&nbsp;campaign and didn't allow himself to be pulled into mudslinging.&nbsp; Yesterday I saw a Bush&nbsp;ad on FNC that was basically a bash of Kerry.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I'm just concerned that this stuff won't work.&nbsp;&nbsp; W is known for being steadfast, for&nbsp;not letting his opponents fluster him, but negativity shows that you've been irritated.&nbsp; Perhaps I'm over-reacting to one ad and this op-ed, but I think in a campaign based on fear and negativity, the Demos win every time.&nbsp; After all, they're the masters at crises-based demagoguery.&nbsp; Bush needs to take the high road, or he's going to soon&nbsp;be joining pop on the golf course.

      Here I sit eating a piece of my dad's birthday cake, watching the  urlLink Cardinals &nbsp;steamroll the NL Central, and it's time to talk  urlLink  King Arthur  .&nbsp; Although generally  urlLink lambasted by the critics , I believe it is a solid film, although I can't help but wonder&nbsp;about its potential for greatness that remained unattained.&nbsp; More on that later.&nbsp;  urlLink Clive Owen &nbsp;turned in a decent performance as Arthur, showing appropriate anger via mostly mouth-acting.&nbsp; The camera cut away every moment I thought he was going to fall short.&nbsp; Nice work  urlLink Antoine !&nbsp; Speaking of camera work, DP  urlLink Slawomir Idziak &nbsp;did a slick job, and the editing was also solid.&nbsp; One scene in particular deserves mention: the semi-climactic duel between Owen and  urlLink Stellan Skarsgard .&nbsp; While not as monumental as  urlLink Maximus v. Commodus &nbsp;due to fairly weak character development, I appreciate the way the battle was shot and edited.&nbsp; I firmly believe that in any hand-to-hand combat scene, fewer cuts make for a more intense experience, and that theory was utilized here to some extent.&nbsp; Of course, there have to be at least a few cuts for respite's sake, but too many seem to&nbsp;disorient the viewer.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The film&nbsp;had an entertaining plotline, but I felt that the characters could have been developed a little better.&nbsp; And&nbsp;this leads me to&nbsp;that&nbsp;unachieved greatness I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; In the film,&nbsp;Arthur plays a&nbsp;Christian who is doctrinally a Palagius-follower.&nbsp; For those not keen on their 3rd-4th century&nbsp;church history, :) Palagius taught that man has free will to choose&nbsp;God, rather than the&nbsp;predestination doctrine that most churches have accepted over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;the&nbsp;underlying message of the film turns out to be an interesting question of what happens when men (particularly Arthur's&nbsp;knights, who gain freedom from the Roman Legion), have the ability to choose duty rather than being forced into it.&nbsp; However, throughout the story, Arthur's faith is challenged by his pagan cohorts and other professing believers who commit atrocities.&nbsp; All the while I was thinking and hoping that the current of the&nbsp;plot was going to be a test of Arthur's faith, and a triumph of his perseverance despite&nbsp;the opposition to his devotion to Christ.&nbsp;But in the end, this route is not directly addressed, but instead&nbsp;the movie takes&nbsp;the free will/duty option as the main message.&nbsp; And yet, perhaps the question of his faith&nbsp;was answered, albeit not verbally.&nbsp; It may be that Arthur's premarital bedroom exploits (implied), and eventual marriage to a pagan woman ( urlLink Keira Knightley ) indicate his faith didn't direct his life as much as we thought it did.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; Had the film more directly and positively explored this aspect, it just may have become a classic.&nbsp; 7/10   Also at the drive-in, I had the unpleasant experience of suffering through  urlLink  Dodgeball  .&nbsp; With only one genuinely funny moment, this movie is not only stupid, but repulsive.&nbsp; Stay far, far away.&nbsp; 2/10

      Today's return to class solidifies my hatred of school.&nbsp; Although the class should be easy (no papers!), I'm just way too lazy to get motivated for this kind of stuff.&nbsp; Reading one of the textbooks tonight only furthered my vitriolic rage;&nbsp; not only biased, it has numerous typographical errors.&nbsp; I would like to think that a Phd could spell Iraqis correctly ("Iraquis"?).&nbsp; One of the first questions asked of the prof today was "Are we going to have to know where any of the countries are?"&nbsp; :^&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously, if you can't find Middle Eastern countries on a map, it's time to turn off Survivor and turn on your brain.&nbsp; Sorry I'm being so negative, it just seems to be the appropriate route to take at the moment.&nbsp; Things will begin looking up when I realize that I don't have to listen to the lectures to get an A, and start doing other things in class.&nbsp; Like playing chess on my Palm Pilot. I am itching to write some of my thoughts on  urlLink  King Arthur  , but it's gonna have to wait.&nbsp;  Also, my thank-you letters are in the mail as of 9:30 this morning.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing many of you on here!

      Well today was my first day back at work, and everything went pretty well.&nbsp; However, before that I went to USI to buy books for my exciting class that starts tomorrow (The Middle East), and then to CVS to get my digital pictures printed.&nbsp; There are a couple of spectacular shots, lots of good ones, and lots of bad ones.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;be posting many of them in the China Report, which I am currently working on.&nbsp; That is, if the upload picture icon that Mitch showed me today actually works.&nbsp; :^D

      Well, there were no waffles for breakfast this morning.&nbsp; No matter; I ate a bowl and a half of Cheerios that tasted surprisingly good considering they had been open for at least three weeks.  &nbsp;  I was in a complete daze during my first class at church - America's Christian Heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp; The topic was Christianity during the Civil War, and while I found most of it interesting, I zoned in and out a lot.&nbsp; Lots of blank staring at various inanimate objects.&nbsp; I was a bit more alert during the college/20's class though.  &nbsp;  After I got home, I took a 3.5 hr nap, then got up around 5:45 to go to the Acropolis with the fam.&nbsp; I must admit that I was again in a daze for this outing, and not very hungry.&nbsp;Being out on the east side of the Ville further crystallized my desire to not be here, but to return to HK.&nbsp; Although I love the U.S., and&nbsp;enjoy seeing friends and family again, what I was doing in China just seemed more meaningful than what goes on here.&nbsp; C'est la vis&nbsp; (sp?) &nbsp;  Over the next week or so, I intend to construct a detailed report about my mission trip to Hong Kong and China.&nbsp; As I didn't take notes or journal while I was there, the entire&nbsp;piece will be constructed from my memory, and it may be a week before anything is posted.&nbsp; For those on my support team, I will be sending a letter and postcard to you with general details about the trip, but the more specific info will be found here.&nbsp; I apologize for not sending postcards from HK as I intended; let's just say that doing so was not as convenient as I thought it would be.&nbsp; Stay tuned.

      So at 7:34 a.m. on July 18th 2004&nbsp;due in part to a sleepless night, I have decided to join the blogging world.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Looks like fun, and two friends' respective blogs have also exacted influence.&nbsp; Hats off to Mitch Harden ( urlLink http://discord.us/blog/ ) and Megan Elder( urlLink http://thesojourner.blogspot.com ) for this unintentional accomplishment!&nbsp; I suppose it's not much of an accomplishment unless I post really cool stuff though.&nbsp; Forthcoming, I hope.&nbsp;  &nbsp; My sleepless night was due to several things: jet lag thanks to a 15 hour return flight from China on Friday, 14 hours of sleep Friday night and Saturday morning (and&nbsp;1 hour of the afternoon), and my racing mind.&nbsp; Soon I will get ready to go to church by eating waffles (I hope) and getting dressed.&nbsp; Until then I am going to explore more blogger features such as profiles and what-not.&nbsp; Expect lots of stuff from me&nbsp;about movies, Christianity, politics, and of course the mundane aspects of my life in Evansville.&nbsp; I apologize for my lack of sentence flow and&nbsp;combination; hopefully that will improve with more sleep and better health!

      A  urlLink CT article  about Ronald Reagan's popularity among Christians presents an interesting question:  who would I vote for in a Reagan v. Bush contest?  A total impossibility I know, but the real issue here is who made/makes a better prez.  The article buttresses what I suspected all along when comparing the two:  Reagan was a conservative, but when it came to walking v. talking he chose the latter, at least on social issues.  And thus, we have the Great Communicator.  Could I have, I definitely would have voted for Reagan in '80 & '84, but I prefer real action to good acting, which is why I think W would receive my vote in a Bush/Reagan face-off.  Ronnie may have been capable of dismantling anyone in a debate and flawless at making the electorate feel warm fuzzies inside, but Bill Clinton could do that too, albeit not as well or as broadly.  But on social issues, Bush 43 has taken more action than did his pop's boss.   W is compared more to Reagan than even his own father, and while Reagan was a much better politician and rhetorician, Bush seems to be more active, which I find to be good strategery.

      As the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey team's coach in   urlLink Miracle  , Kurt Russell offers some narration at the end of the movie in which he mentions "Dream Teams" that were created shortly after the Miracle on Ice.  "A few years later, the U.S. began using professional athletes at the Games - Dream Teams. I always found that term ironic because now that we have Dream Teams, we seldom ever get to dream," he said.  But judging from the U.S. men's basketball team's thrashing at the hands of Puerto Rico (!) today, we may have to start dreaming.  How is it that the supposed best players in the world get  urlLink trounced by 19 points  by a bunch of "no-names"?  Well, I suppose there could be several explanations.  Most of the guys on the team are fairly young, albeit very talented.  Lebron James has one pro season under his belt, and Okafur just graduated from UCONN last spring, but youth shouldn't be enough to cause a loss of this magnitude.  Coach Larry Brown's post-game comments could be closer to the real reason for the loss:  "I had a job to do as a coach, to get us to understand how we're supposed to play as a team and act as a team, and I don't think we did that."  An individualistic attitude seems to have become more pervasive in recent years, especially among NBA players.  The game has become more of a one-on-one showcase of spoiled stars, and apparently the current Dream squad has had multiple defections and issues with players showing up to team meetings.  It's time for these men to learn some more wisdom from Kurt: "When you pull on that jersey, the name on the front is a hell of alot more important than the one on the back."

      Finally, here is part II! This details our time in Zhongshan, and I will later post part III that will include our last day in HK, the return home, and some final thoughts about the trip.  To the Mainland! 7/9 Friday was mostly a travel day for us, as we set out on a charter bus for Zhongshan. I spent the 2-hour journey next to Katie H., and I fell asleep for part of it. The fact that I was sitting next to Katie had nothing to do with that. I developed a slight cough during the ride; more on that later. The bus ride was quite exciting. Our driver apparently found no reason to heed traffic rules, as we sped down the highway honking smaller vehicles out of our way and using turn lanes to bypass traffic.  Zhongshan was a bit of a change compared to Hong Kong. More rural and impoverished, the city actually reminded me of what I have seen of Baghdad: kind of dirty and tattered, but plenty of somewhat modern buildings, roads and vehicles. Everything was much more spread out than in HK, and the roads were dotted with palm trees. We stayed in the Ma Ling village, which is second-world at best. However, our facility was palatial compared to the High Rock camp, with large bathrooms, plenty of space, as well as ping-pong and pool tables. A faux marbel fortress with a mote, the Friendship Home would keep us comfy for the next few days. We ate some authentic Chinese food at a local restaurant for dinner, then returned to the house to settle in.  "Free" Day 7/10 Saturday was a free day - the only scheduled activities were meals and a meeting to discuss what we would be doing at the government primary school Monday through Wednesday. I went to breakfast at a very small, and what we in the west would call an "unsanitary"  urlLink establishment . The dining room had 4 tables, the front was open to the outside, and the kitchen was not something I wanted to see. However, the boiled wontons were pretty good. Lunch and dinner were traditional Chinese: rice, chicken, pork, noodles, fried wontons, and assorted greens that I didn't touch. This type of meal would become standard fare for the balance of our stay in Zhongshan. We also had the opportunity to get some ice cream at a local shop, which was very refreshing.  Government Church or "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Trust the Three-Self Movement" 7/11 Well, I don't really trust the Three-Self Movement, but Greg informed us that the government church we attended on Sunday actually had quite biblical teaching. I can't independently corroborate this, as the sermon was in Cantonese and translated into...Mandarin. Our fellow worshipers were very interested in staring at us, and I enjoyed an unofficial competition of breaking their gazes. It was very interesting to worship with people across the world in a different language, and at the end of the service we sang a few English worship songs for the choir. After the service, some on our team took the opportunity to go on house visits, but I was feeling exhausted and malaise, so I opted out for a nap back at the F-house. At night we continued to prepare for our activities at the government school. This involved me racking my brain to come up with a cheer and slogan for the group of kids Ethan and I would be leading, and we also made some paper birds and tangrams.  Govt. School Ministry and One Saved Soul 7/12 Monday morning we conducted some activities at the local  urlLink government school  with elementary aged children. First, we introduced ourselves and taught the kids "Old MacDonald". Then each American on the team worked with one HK university student leading a group of kids to come up with a slogan and cheer that would subsequently be performed in front of approximately 100 other students. My first group was the Blue Monkeys, and we repeated this once more with a different name, slogan and cheer. We became horses for the next round, and these proceedings produced a good opportunity to laugh at certain other team members, particularly one college pastor. We then left the school and ate lunch at a dive where we would become regulars for the next three days. Chicken was served with the head and feet, along with rice and other standard Chinese selections. Dessert was ho ho mei: fried sweet rolls with dipping sauce, and I would consume approximately 30 of these over the next three days.  Our evening ministry was at the Friendship House, and involved small group discussions with local kids. The purpose was to hopefully broach spiritual topics. I again was paired with Ethan, and he did translation for the 3 boys in our group, aged 13-17. Ethan was very eager to share the gospel with them after we dispensed with surface pleasantries, and he did so in Cantonese for about 10 minutes. I watched. After he was finished, I wanted to ask the boys some questions to determine how much of the gospel they believed. My first translated question to them was "Do you believe you have sinned?" One boy said "No", while the other two agreed that they had done some wrong things in their lifetime. I then had Ethan ask those two if they wanted to receive forgiveness from Christ for their sins, and they both were interested. I wanted to make sure that they understood that by praying a "sinner's prayer", they were not only receiving forgiveness and entrance to heaven, but making Jesus Lord of their lives. One boy was no longer interested. The final boy, a 17-year-old named Pui (Pooh-ee), still wanted to pray with us. Me, Ethan and Pui removed ourselves from the group, and I led Pui in a prayer to receive Christ with Ethan translating. We then shared a couple of verses with him as encouragement, and had a  urlLink picture  shot by Katie H. This event was by and far the high point of my entire two weeks in China. This is what I came for. Being able to see immediate fruit was a huge blessing, and I was very thankful for God's work that night.  Back to School 7/13 Tuesday we basically had the same schedule as Monday, except our activities at the school were slightly different. Instead of doing "cheers", two Americans were paired with each other and facilitated different activities in various classrooms. Each of our HK university students had a group of 8-10 kids, and they brought them to each of the classrooms to participate. I was paired with Tiffany, and we attempted to teach the children english color names with tangrams. The kids made different designs out of the tangrams, and they were pretty good at doing this, even to the point where we had to tell them to make a square in order to stump them. However, even this did not befuddle a couple of the students. After the school activities, we went to lunch, then back to the F-house to relax until the evening small group discussions. I took a nap, as my health was continuing to spiral downward. I skipped dinner that evening and stayed at the house to rest. Unfortunately, I was not even feeling good enough to participate in the group discussions, so I laid in bed and prayed and stared at the bottom of the top bunk.  Back to School and HK! 7/14 Wednesday was our last day in Zhongshan, and we conducted the precise same program at the school that we did on Tuesday. I was able to make it through the first round of tangrams, but during the break I went to the teacher's lounge and rested in a large, comfy leather chair. I planned on returning to the activities after the break, but I dozed off and when Greg came to get me I thought it best to just continue my attempts at sleep. The teachers in the lounge were extremely loud and did not stop talking for more than 15 seconds, so it was difficult to actually sleep, but I needed the relaxation. I was able to return to the assembly hall to say goodbye and sign autographs for the students however. That's right, they wanted our autographs, and I felt strangely comfortable signing them! :^D We had our last tasty lunch at the restaurant, and then it was time to head back to HK. The two hour bus ride back was brutal for me. I wanted to sleep, but the seating was cramped and I happened to pick the only window on the bus that didn't have a curtain, so the sun was beating down. Woe was me. Anyway, we got back to HK, and while everyone else went to eat dinner, Greg took me to his doctor. I told the doc that I had a history of sinus infections, and he decided to go ahead and give me antibiotics even though I didn't have a fever. He also prescribed several other meds, which came in little plastic ziplock bags with Chinese writing on them. After the doctor, I went back to the camp and tried to get a good night's rest for our final full day in China.

      Last night I watched   urlLink To End All Wars   with Rusty, a 2001 drama/war flick starring  urlLink Robert Carlyle  and  urlLink Kiefer Sutherland . Based on the true story of an allied unit taken captive by the Japanese during WWII, the film chronicles the prisoners' struggles as they are forced to build a railroad to aid the Empire's impending invasion of India.  Although the plot does not flow seamlessly, that didn't really affect the overall weight of the message. More impacting for the questions it raises than the manner in which they are raised, this film is incredibly searing and subtly powerful. What is justice in the face of barbaric brutality? What is the price of cruelty? Of forgiveness? The story addresses these questions poetically but not tritely. Wedding the realistic brutality of   urlLink Platoon   with the lyrical narration and philosophical overtones of   urlLink The Thin Red Line  ,  To End All Wars  trumps the former with its message and the latter with its plot. After watching the movie, I felt like my daily problems are insignificant; that in fact modern daily life is quite superficial. Listening to music in the car on the way home felt inappropriate vis-a-vis what I had just seen, kind of like listening to upbeat rock music after watching   urlLink The Passion of the Christ  .  To End All Wars  should probably be viewed a couple of times to absorb all the intricacies of its meaning, which is ultimately a message of extreme forgiveness in the face of cold-blooded inhumanity. 7/10

      Yesterday morning I stopped in Hallmark to procure a wedding card for Jeff and Cheryl, but there was one card in particular that irked me. On the front, it said something like, "In God's special timing, He brings you that one perfect soul to complete you." So now thanks to our popular culture's Jerry Maguire-esque myths, God has become a cosmic match-maker whose goal is to complete you with a soulmate. Poppycock. I think the purpose of male-female romantic relationships and the notion of love have been sorely distorted. Instead of joining another person in matrimony to sacrifice for and truly love them, we apparently are supposed to "find ourselves" and achieve "self-actualization" from our spouse.  The next morning I awoke early and decided to pass the time by reading another chapter of C.S. Lewis'  The Great Divorce . A section I read spoke directly on this issue. In one scene, a dwarf ghost is momentarily reunited in heaven with his former earthly wife. She has received the gift of eternal life, but the ghost is trapped in his current dwarfish state due to his inability to let go of the Tragedian, a phantom he leads on a leash who symbolizes the dwarf ghost's inability to love and experience joy. The dwarf is upset that his former wife seems unwilling to reciprocate his desperation for her to "complete" him. Well, she no longer needs to play those games because she has been completed by Christ. Here's part of the exchange, in which the Tragedian is attempting to keep the dwarf ghost in his miserable state (it helps to realize that the dwarf ghost and Tragedian are one-and-the-same):   "Love!" said the Tragedian striking his forehead with his hand: then, a few notes deeper, "Love! Do you know the meaning of the word?"   "How should I not?" said the Lady. "I am in love.  In  love, do you understand? Yes, now I love truly."   "You mean," said the Tragedian, "you mean -- you did  not  love me truly in the old days?"   "Only in a poor sort of way," she answered. "I have asked you to forgive me. There was a little real love in it. But what we called love down there [on earth] was mostly the craving to be loved. In the main I loved you for my own sake: because I needed you."   "And now!" said the Tragedian with a hackneyed gesture of despair. "Now, you need me no more?"   "But of course not!" said the Lady; and her smile made me wonder how both the phantoms could refrain from crying out with joy. "What needs could I have," she said, "now that I have all? I am full now, not empty. I am in Love Himself, not lonely. Strong, not weak. You shall be the same. Come and see. We shall have no  need  for one another now: we can begin to love truly."     That last line blows me away. To think, that in spite of today's "hooking-up"-obsessed-culture what we really need is for God to complete us, and only then "we can begin to love truly". Lewis, you were brilliant.

      At risk of alienating my non-Christian readers, the topic of this post is nonetheless of a "religious" nature. While reading one of my textbooks on Middle Eastern politics earlier this week, a quoted section discussing the lethargy of the Ba'athist party in Syria stood out to me. One sentence in particular caught my eye, but more because it seems to describe Midwestern U.S. Christians than because of the context in which it was written. I quote: "They talk much more than they act. . .  In fact, culturally, they seem to reflect their society far too much to be able to radically transform it ."[Emphasis mine]. When I look at Western Christians in general, indeed when I look at my own Christianity, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between us and those who don't believe. Of course, on the west coast and in the northeast this is a bit different, but here in the "Bible Belt" everyone's a "Christian". Or so they say. But are the genuine believers even distinct enough from the surrounding cultural climate in order to impress slight changes, let alone radical transformation? That doesn't seem to be the case from my view. Thoughts, please.

      First, a few adminstrative items. Check out the comments under posts titled "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Inconsistency is Consistency If You're Like That All the Time".  In order to encourage more of this, I am going to allow anonymous posts on the blog so everyone can make comments without having to mess with a user name and password.  Whether the topic is politics, movies or sports, keep the dissent coming!   I don't want this site to be a sermon to the choir.  However, if you do post anonymously, consider signing your first name anyway.  I am currently working on Part II of the China Report, but due to my schedule this week it may not be posted until next week.  And now for the most ridiculous item of the day: upon a visit to  urlLink Mitch 's office today, I found him filling out a  urlLink survey  to determine which sci-fi/fantasy character he most closely embodies.  After taking the survey myself, the results indicated that I am  urlLink Yoda !  Imagine that.  Aren't you glad to be reading the blog of such a wise Jedi?

      Another day, another movie.  Saw   urlLink The Manchurian Candidate   last night, and although I was wary going into it due to the  urlLink Rich article  from an earlier post, I was thoroughly entertained.  I have seen the original  urlLink Frankenheimer classic , but don't remember much about it.  That doesn't mean I didn't like it though, and I think my foggy memories helped me to enjoy the remake more than if I had been closely comparing the two.  There are similarities, but the new film updates the setting to a modern-day, absurdly Orwellian terror-saturated America.  Rich was mostly correct in his evaluation, but the movie is not as overtly politically opinionated as I thought it would be.  However, it is clear that the  urlLink director  wanted to paint the current geo-political landscape as one fraught with fear and doomsday-ish machinations.  In what Rich sees as a deft ploy to trick the right,  urlLink Meryl Streep's  conniving character (flawlessly portrayed) is actually a Democrat (implied), who conspires to use her son to control the presidency.  Although the movie subtly injects a steady dose of leftist ideology (a failing war on terror and a corporate conspiratorial putsch), this did not deflate my enjoyment of a well-executed, intensely slick storyline.  Artistically admirable and solidly acted,  Candidate  held my attention completely, resulting in quite an entertaining trip.  Alarmist politics aside, this one is worth your time if for nothing other than the cerebral calisthenics. 7/10
