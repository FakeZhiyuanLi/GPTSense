      hey! ive never had a blog before...but sarah (SC!) has inspired me to start one! so nothings really happened so far today. i got up at 9 to watch DAWSON'S CREEK (only the best show EVER) and when that was over at 11, i got myself a bowl of honey-nut cheerios! seriously, those are a classic. then i watched saved by the bell and started looking at my list for everything i needed for CAMP PIKE (9 days)! im going on Wilderness this year (with SJizzle and katy!!) and daaaaaaaang it requires alot of crap! they say we're supposed to fit everything into one little backpack thing...ha yeah RIGHT! the list of stuff we need fills up the ENTIRE page! Sarah Jane and i are gonna have one heck of a time trying to trudge up those mountains with BIODEGRADABLE SHAMPOO and COOKING UTENSILS in our backpacks! hahaha, SJ, this is gonna be a sight to see! but yeah SJ is my tentmate! woot woot! and im realllllly excited because SJ is a blast...if you know her, you know what i mean! but anywaaaays,  im about to go to open gym with sue (last time we kicked some sophmores-to-be @$$). after that i think ill go running, because, as davis says, i need to work on my stamina/conditioning. and then im off to my g-ma's house for the night! in the morning im helping her with this food bank program...so thats cool because im helping people AND its gonna look stellar on my college applications! and i know people get pissed at me for even talking about college now, and for actually caring about my future...but theyre just gonna have to deal with it. i most definitely want to go to TCU (yeah christina!), but we'll see. so i guess ive written alot...probly too much...so yeah, adios!

      so today i went to mavs hoop camp. ive been going all this week, and tomorrows the last day of it, thank goodness. all the kids there are younger than i am, except theres like 3 other 16-year-olds. and for some reason ive been feeling REALLY lazy all week and so ive been playing like crap. but we still get to meet mavs players and stuff so thats cool. on tuesday scott williams came and visited. hes soooo nice. and today shawn bradley and eddie najera came. eddie went one on one with lots of kids, it was tiiiight. hes such a pimp. he was playing against this one kid,&nbsp; and&nbsp;everyone else was sitting there watching, and his sweat FLUNG all over me, it was very disgusting. but after camp i came home and showered and now im&nbsp;about to eat dinner. im probly just gonna end up watching BIG FISH tonight at mi casa because everyone else seems to be busy. and hopefully ill read tonight. i have this stack of books in my room that im trying to read this summer, and i made a huge dent in it at the beginning of summer, but ive been slowing down. i need to pick up the pace. but tomorrow is FINALLY the last day of camp! we have 5 on 5 and 3 on 3 tournaments all day and thats pretty cool i guess, except my 5 on 5 team sucks. anyways, last night i went to bob rehm's house for our pike party thing. we all brought our pictures that we had developed and chatted for a while. then courtney and i drove over to magic mike's and met spenser, catherine, and mary and we all drove to this snowcone stand where we met zack, tyson, chelsea, and hailey. i had this vanilla cream snowcone...it was SOOOO good. i&nbsp;definitely recommend it. by the time we were done eating and talking it was like 10:15 and most of our curfews were 11, so we left. but there was&nbsp;a bit of mishap in courtneys truck because spenser called "shotgun", but naturally, i called "shotgun joust" and then beat him to the car door. but then he wouldnt give me the front seat so we finally tried to resolve the matter by fighting for it. and, actually, after a LONG time, courtney suggested that we play rock-paper-scissors for it, 2 out of 3. so we did, and guess who won? brenna! and after a little more bickering by mr samms, i finally got my seat in the front. you see, i didnt really want the SEAT, it was more of a pride thing. so that was a good ending to an okay day. so yeah this weeks been reallllly slow because of camp, and next week i leave for san antonio with my dad! ill definitely be wearing some MAVERICKS attire...SPURS SUCK (even though, in reality, theyre going to be wow good this year)! adios!

      yesterday i got back from Camp Pike 'o4! omg it was sooooo fun! seriously everyone that went on Wilderness was a BLAST to be with and we all had such a good time! the ride to colorado was like 15 hours, and we all rode on the same bus. it was a long ride, but we always have fun just chillin. then the day we got to the camp, we got to stay in this cabin called "jungfrau", although none of us could figure out what that meant or who thought of calling a cabin that. and we discovered that there were a few mice in our cabin...not cool. but they were all downstairs, not where our beds were, so it was okay. then the next morning we go up early and went to Inspiration Point, which is this AMAZING spot that the whole camp climbs to, and we have our morning devotion. from Inspiration Point you cant see so many mountains, hills, trees, and the rest of camp. its simply gorgeous! then we headed out for our "warm-up hike" to St. Elmo's. (has anyone seen "St. Elmo's Fire", the movie, with demi moore? its so awesome!) St. Elmo's was a 6 mile hike, and we all&nbsp;finished&nbsp;splendidly.&nbsp;then we went to pizza hut to get&nbsp;some pizzzzzzza and then we played the tripping game, which was SO fun!&nbsp;then we headed to our campsight and pitched our tent, which SJ and i were experts at! and we slept there that night and met some boy scouts that said they were 16 when they OBVIOUSLY werent. the next morning we went white-water rafting for the whole day. that was seriously awesome! our raft guide's name was John Meyer, kinda like John Mayer, so we just called him John da Bomb. and there were rapids called "the wall slammer" and stuff like that. doesnt make you feel very confident, but thats okay, it was so fun! then. that night,&nbsp;we stayed at the same camp sight as the night before, and SJ gave pavey and courtney a "present" but i wont talk about that, you just had to be there. then the next morning we went to a bakery and got donuts, and spenser paid for me because my money&nbsp;was in the trailor &nbsp;(thanks spenser). then me, katy, catherine, SJ, and brittany went in search of a bathroom across the entire town of Buena Vista. finally we found one. and then we headed off to Mt. Massive with our HUGE @$$ backpacks on our backs. the hike was soooo long and it hurt everyones back SO much. when we got to our campsite in the middle of this gorgeous canyon like thing, we realized the hike was worth it. we were surrounded by peaks, and the canyon had these two lakes that was gorgeous, and FREEZING (according to the boys and katy, who all jumped in). we set up camp that night, and ate some chicken and rice (yum). the next day was the most strenuous, scary thing ive ever done...but i did it. we all did it. that day we summited Mt. Massive (the second tallest mt in colorado) by making our own trail up this almost 90 degree angled ridge. it was so slippery and hard, but when we got to the top it was gorgeous! then after we got to the top of the ridge, we summited the peak. then we made ANOTHER trail down...but this time we slid on our butts in SNOW most of the way down. our hands were freezing, our butts were wet, and some&nbsp;boys were bleeding from helping catch the girls when we got to the end of the snow patches and couldnt slow down...but we made it back down to camp with just a few minor injuries. we slept again that night in the tents, and woke up the next morning at like 9&nbsp;to spenser playing the guitar, which was nice. then we made our way back down the mountain with our huge packs on our backs. it went much faster than on&nbsp;the way up. we got down and then went to K's for lunch, which was verrrrry good. and then we went to this resale shop to buy our clothes for the dance that night. i got this weird skirt that was all colors and had weird patterns, and this yellow shirt that had little bows on it that looked like baloons. then we got back to camp and FINALLY took showers...which felt SO good, you have no idea. and then we headed back to the chapel for our skits. everyones was boring, except ours, of course, rocked. then we got the dance started and it was so much fun! i danced with this little boy during a slow dance because John Bryan asked me to because the little guy was shy and wouldnt ask a girl to dance with him. it was fun. and then the dance ended and we went back to the lodge and since wilderness didnt get dinner, we made ourselves some PB&amp;J's and hot chocolate. we got our packages that our parents sent us then, and mi madre sent me some chips, doritoes, queso, skittles, and PEACHIE O'S (spenser theyre allllll&nbsp;MINE)!!! then we went back to sleep (after everyone kept trying to kill all the little mice that were in our rooms...what did the mice ever do to us???? nothing! we shouldve just sent them outside). we went to inspiration point again, the next morning, and that was sweet. and then we went down for breakfast in the dining hall and then we packed and watched all the little kids get awards for climbing Pike's Peak, when wilderness didnt get ANYTHING for climbing the hardest thing EVER!! (jk im not bitter) then we took pictures of our whole group, and i know theyre gonna turn out great! then we finally headed back home on our huge buses, i slept alot, talked, read, and watched happy gilmore and bruce almighty.&nbsp;finally when we got back to church, i talked to lindsay chinn for a while and then mi padre took me and michael to get DONUTS! woot woot! then i got home, showered, and slept the rest of the day! PIKE WAS AWESOME!!! I LOVE YOU GUYS! COUNSELORS NEXT YEAR BABY!!

      hey! last night i chilled with bridgette at kid kountry for a lil bit, because we're just THAT cool. it was fun because we chatted and got bit by some skeeters. and then we went to wendys and met sue and ash there. then we headed to bridges house and hung out in her room where ashley played with the bouncy ball, and susan ate her candy necklace. and then sue came to my house for the night and bridge went to ashleys for the night. sue and i chilled and watched THE IN CROWD. if you havent seen it, i highly recommend it. but its like really suspensful and kinda scary. then we got up at 9 to watch some dawsons creek-age...the second episode this morning was the one where dawsons dad DIES! it was sad. but then i took her home this morning and now we're about to leave for open gym woo hoo! we're trying to get buff, but its a lonnnnnnng slow process. but we wont be there for an ultra long time, just like 3-430 or so. so its okay i guess. and we usually talk alot to random people. but then after open gym im coming home and going to my g-mas house again. should be a doozy. but anyways, we leave for pike in DOS DIAS! woot woot im so excited! this year is wilderness and its gonna be prettttttttty hard. we dont shower or anything for like a week, and we pee in the woods, and cook our own food. i know its kind of a turn off at how much we have to do on our own, but it should be really fun, and get me in shape. dude the camp is in colorado, where the air is thinner there, so you have to adjust, and we climb mountains everyday, so i think im good on the getting into shape part. oh and its a christian camp, so thats awesome! the bus ride is like 16 hours, or something crazy like that, but its always fun. okay well i gtg pick up sue, adios!

      hey guys! so last night, i went to SJ's house for a bit to learn how to set our tent up for pike (its so...small). actually it ended up being that her madre set the entire thing up and SJ and i just chilled and watched. but we're so smart that it wont be a problem for us when we have to do it for realllll. and then SJ came to MY house and we ate chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, and watched MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. dude thats one funny movie. then we woke up at 9 to watch dawsons creek (because we're hardcore fans) and then she left to go to work. it was mucho fun SJ! and then i had lots of pancakes. and then my madre wanted to go get everything that my brother, michael, and i needed for pike that we didnt have already. soooo we went to bass pro and got all that crap. so after that i was gonna go to open gym, but susan had an oral surgeon appt, and i didnt wanna go with out SUE (so we're going tomorrow)! so instead i came home and ran on our treadmill...which was interesting because i didnt even know we HAD a treadmill. and then i did my daily 500 crunches (trying to work this newly-acquired-gut-from-italy off) and did a little weight lifting using dumbbells and this big squishy ball that we have for some reason. and then i took a shower, and when i got out...guess who was waiting for me?!?! lindsay! she came by to get her stuff that she left in my car. and then we talked for a bit and she left. and now im getting ready to go to steak and shake with sare, bridge, mel, and kels! im excited because ive only been there once with our bball team in eigth (i think, maybe it was ninth) grade (and im excited to chill with these girls). and im really in the mood for a shake...and i forgot to ask lindsay (while she was here) if she was working tonight at steak and shake...hmmm well i guess ill find out. so i know this was really boring to read, but once something happens with my mavs (like if we get shaq or erick dampier or kmart), my entries will get muy interestante. so heres whats happened with them so far. first, we dealt antawn jamison to washington for jerry stackhouse, christian laettener, and their #5 pick in the draft. so with that pick, we got devin harris (cool kid). and then we traded a future first round pick of ours for utahs 21st pick this year, and we got this "Siberian Shaq" whos 7'5". and then of course, is the horrid loss of steve nash. he was a free agent and agreed to go to phoenix for 5 years at like 65 mil. that SUCKED...but marquis daniels agreed to stay with us, so thats good news. the actual first day that any free agent can sign with a team is july 14th...so make sure and mark that on your calendar. MARK CUBAN BETTER DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY, OR ELSE I'LL PUMMEL HIS @$$! okay well ive talked enough...adios! muah!

      omg breaking news: steve nash is going to the phoenix suns! and out of free agency, we didnt even get anything in return. okay he hasnt ACTUALLY signed with phoenix yet, but july 14th he'll be able to! omg the mavs' trading ability for shaq depended alot on steve nash. grrrrr! but i read an article about this tonight and steve said that he called dirk and findawg to break the news to them. that was sweet of him. i thought that if we lost nash, we'd at least be getting shaq or erick dampier or SOMEone. i seriously thought he would resign with us. anyways enough about that i guess. so this morning i went and helped my grandma at a food bank thing called "network" with my cousin, brett. it was alot of fun! but then i went to eat at my grandmas country club with her and brett, i had cheese pizza...mmmm. then i came home and took a very nice nap. much needed, i might add. and then i went to daddy jacks with my mom and dave (if you dont know, dave's my stepdad). i had garlic mashed potatos (yummmm) and chicken...not that you care. uhhh then i came home and found out this dreadful news about stevie nash. and i swear, if mark cuban trades  dirk  for  shaq , i will hate MC. then i went running, it felt so good...i love the feeling right after youve run for a while. it feels like ive accomplished something. but then i watched this baby video of my fam at this dude ranch. wow it was the funniest thing ive seen all week...besides when susan and i were driving and she was like "hey isnt that (a girl that i would rather not mention the name)?" and then the car turns the corner and its this GUY! wow sue, that was SO funny! but then after watching my baby video thing, katy called and i talked to her for a while. and now im writing this...so its been kinda a long, slow day. and tomorrow im seeing THE NOTEBOOK for the third time (woot woot!)! the movie is incredible and the book is seriously in my top 3 favorites ever! okay well im out.
