      So I have had this theory for a while that everything that is popular is a trap.  Homeownership comes to mind on this one.  If I may be sincere for just a moment: FUCKING A!  My wife and I bought a house less than 3 weeks ago and I am now so broke and tired and disillusioned that for just a second, I thought about ordering "Fitness Made Simple."  You know, that John Basedow video they advertise on cable.  I was just sitting there staring blankly at the TV last night and I thought 'hmph, that is a pretty good deal.'  That is how it happens.  Society is engineered to wear you down until your defenses are low enough to allow for something like that to happen.  Luckily the dryer buzzer went off just then or else I would be tracking a UPS package like a madman for the next 3-6 days.  Seriously, UPS package tracking is awesome, but don't you get obsessed when there is something on its way and you have access to UPS' database 24x7?  OK, So one of my other theories that falls right out of that popular=trap one is that if you are getting into something in response to an advertisement, then you missed the boat.  The exception that proves this rule is American Idol.  I love American Idol and I realized that I have something akin to Seasonal Depression Disorder.  But its weird because its the summertime when there is plenty of sun that I get all frumpy about the Barsotti compound.  When Idol is off the air, is life really worth living?  I am just not sure anymore...  So a shameless plug: I am going to be on the O'reilly Factor with host Bill O'reilly tomorrow night.  I have been bumped from the show exactly 19 times and Bill personally promised me I'd be on tomorrow.  He said nobody has EVER been bumped 20 times by 'The Factor.'  I really hope he doesn't bump me again, because I am pretty sure I will cry and I hate to cry in front of another grown man.  What will Mr. O'reilly and I be discussing, you ask?  None other than my new book 'Aliens, will they be capitalists?'  Well, it was new when I was first supposed to be on the show.  When I try to synthesize my entry today I keep coming back to the same conclusion.  And the words aren't mine.  Quoting one CowboyNeal from slashdot: "I can't help but be reminded of the gully dwarves from Dragonlance when reading this."

      Okay, so this is a little embarrassing, but I don't exactly know what is meant by the term 'mixing metaphors.' I think I should be wise enough to figure it out, but then I think that maybe my brain is broken in that it is unable to grasp this concept. Now I am all worried my brain is broken. I gotta go see a doctor.  ...  Okay, a little time has passed and I've calmed down. So my brother Kevin started a new blog today. I actually have to hand it to him. He told me about blogs way back in the day. I think blogger.com was JUST out at that point. So anyways, I am calling Kevin out. He says his blog is daily, but I bet he ditches it by Monday. Not that I might not do the same with this blog, of course. But until such time as one of us gives, I offer an open challenge that he will give up before I do. That he will fail to post to his blog on a weekday before I will. And if I win, I get to drop Kevin on his head from a ladder. I always wanted to do that to someone. And if Kevin wins I will buy him a coke. Any kind you want, Kevin, Diet, Diet with a twist of lime, Vanilla, C2, Classic. I'll spring for a new coke if I can find one.  When I was a kid, I remember the power a can of coke commanded. Especially in school. I remember drinking my milk or juice or whatever and a teacher would have one or some kid would have one wrapped in aluminum foil - cuz we all know that keeps all the cold in. Anyways, I would just stare at it in awe. But alas, the magic is gone. I now know about the law of diminishing returns. And I know about the times that I got a 12 pack while living with Alex or in college and they were all gone inside of 2 hours... Good Times. Sickening Times, yes, but Good Times, nonetheless.
