      Here I am sitting in my office, surrounded by Coke advertising, on a Friday afternoon and there is not a single soul in the building other than myself.  So why am I here?  To get the packets ready for the 100s of children that will invade WCV in two days time...  This building makes a lot of noise that you don't notice when other people are around... like the shudder the windows make everytime the trains go by... or the shaking of the floor when the big semi trucks pass on the street... or my personal favourite the high pitch whine of the air conditioner as it starts up or turns off.  Well, no problem, I will simply turn on my Misty Edwards CD and drown them all out.  Of course when Yvonne's cd comes out, that will be the CD of choice!  Here's the funny thing!  I am in an office that has more Coke advertising than a coke factory, my wallpaper on the computer is coke, and now the blog site has a definite Coke theme... but I am fasting Coke until the middle of August!!!  I think I enjoy torturing myself... I even have an unopened can of Diet Coke right in front of me right now... but it's all for a good cause, you know... running after Jesus and all that!  Anyway. the photocopier is done, and I have many bags to fill...

      Well, I have finally ventured into the world of cyber space.&nbsp; I must admit I am a little nervous as I try to navigate all the settings, posts etc.&nbsp; I know though that through the support and help of my computer savvy web-godess Yvonne, all will be well.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is much to say, (hmm that makes me think of a quote... "Let me explain... no there is too much, Let me sum up"...) and I hope to spend many hours reading fascinating, life changing, gut splitting comments from all of you!&nbsp; To which of course I will reply with equally fascinating life changing, gut splitting comments that will keep us all in one blogness!&nbsp;  I look forward to communicating with you all in this way!&nbsp; Let me know what you think of the site! Yvonne-- you rock!!!

      I watched Gone With the Wind last night... or at least half of it.  what an amazing flick.  The title means that the society of the southern united states, as a result of the civil war, was gone with the wind.  Everything they knew as normal disappeared and in the midst of it, Scarlet O'Hara goes from a spoiled, childish, helpless girl to a confident, determined and self relient woman.  I think that is an amazing picture of what happens to all of us as we face difficult things.  I stopped the movie when scarlett is standing on the hill vowing that she will never go hungry again... "As God as my witness..."  it really is the turning point of the movie.  She at that point choses to be a fighter when up to this point she really was a complainer with spunk.  So what's my point?  No point really, just observations.  Although, this past weekend I found myself being a complainer with spunk rather than a fighter with faith.  My sugars (I am a diabetic) spiked this weekend for no apparent reason.  This has happened before, but it was especially disheartening because I honestly believed that God had healed me.  My initial response I must say was a defiant complaint... but God is amazingly patient with me.  By  Sunday, I was back in a place of saying "God, you are big and I am little... you do as you will (as if he needs my permission!) and I will fight the disease as dictated by modern medicine and simply wait for your healing"... because I believe it is coming, either in this life or the next...   So yeah... call me Scarlett.  (though I haven't watched the second half of the movie for many years, so if that is a bad thing... just call me Joyska)  Princess Bride Quote: "Pardon me, excuse me, please... Fezzik..."

      okay, I am sitting here trying to figure out what needs to happen for the kids in our church this fall.  I had a parent night to ask parents yesterday and got some good imput for the older kids... now what about all you moms out there with little ones (5 and under).  If you could have anything you wanted for your kids at church, what would you want?  Dream, be creative... what are you looking for?  With what we are already doing at WCV, what would you NOT want to change, and what would you ABSOLUTELY like to see changed? (Please be specific).  The new year always brings opportunity to change and make things better and I want to see that happen.  The questions apply to our older kids as well, and can be answered by parent and non-parent type people... after all I'm not a parent and I have A LOT of influence on what things can look like!  I'm interested in your answers, so please, pass this on to others who might have something to say!  And now, what does Humperdink say to Wesley just before he sucks 50 years of his life away?  Have a great day!

      The sun is shining! The sun is shining!  BUt it si still cold enough to need a sweat shirt... ah you got to love winnipeg!  I spent a lot of today just wandering around downtown, looking longingly into windows and pretending I had a lot of money.  That lasted for about ten minutes and then I went down to McNally's to find a comfortable chair and read a book.  (By the way I have the Princess Pride on hold for a day when I have a little more cash flow!)  I found myself watching people rather than reading though.  There was an old man that walked slower than molasses in January.  People were trying to walk around him and he was totally oblivious to their growing frustration.  I thought "how wonderful to be so oblivious!"  Then the waiter came over and asked if I wanted more tea.  Funny guy, he wouldn't come close to the table at all. I knew I had taken a shower this morning and was wearing perfume, so it couldn't have been my smell... or maybe he didn't like my perfume... so I thought.  but I watched him at other tables and saw him doing the same thing.  Maybe he's afraid of people... maybe he's in the wrong job!  Then I met a friend for lunch and watched as people crowded around mcdonalds and few lined up for the "healthier" choices, like Subway,Manchu wok, bankhok thai, koya and nikos.  Interesting, even when presented with choice, people still choose mcdonald's.  Anyone see the movie "supersized"?    Well, i think I rose to the challenge Yvonne presented in the last entry... I must admit, she scared me with her questions, but after much thought... I think I got the right answers.  Now I have to go home and see if I was right...  The Princess Bride quote of the day... hello... (what comes next?)

      I only have a quick minute so...  Princess bride challenge:   What does Wesley say to the six fingered man when he orders the gaurds to take him to the ship?  Here's an idea... I think I have the whole movie burned into my brain... I challenge you to a duel... to the death... no to the pain!  Try and stump ME on a quote... can it be done?  Let's find out... Go ahead, let's see if it can be done  it's a battle of the minds in a way. Never fight with a dutchwoman when death is on the line!  Hahahahahahahahaha....

      Dreary weather always makes me want to crawl under the blankets and read a good book.  (or watch a great movie or two).  There is something about being alone on a wet cold day that I love.  I tend to enjoy going to movies by myself and going to dinner on my own as it is and somehow the rain makes it even more enjoyable...  Okay hang on... the reality is that on a cold rainy day like today, i find myself running to the office dodging raindrops the size of golf balls from the trees, getting splashed by a passing bus, running straight through puddles the size of Lake Winnipeg (simply because there is no way around them) and then once I am in the building dripping wet, end up shivering all morning because the air conditioning is on!  (But I must say that the rain did make my hair exceptionally curly).  Does this sound like August or October?!  Whatever, I think I will reverse the process, run home and watch a really great movie... like maybe the princess bride!  Quote for today:  "Bye boys!" "Have fun storming the castle!" "Do you think it will work?" "It will take a miracle!"  Princess Bride challenge:  What was said after Miracle Max said "Get away from me witch!" ?  so ... have fun storming the castle!!!

      Okay this blogger thing is pretty amazing.  I have received comments from Japan, Holland and of course the united states...(not to mention that BC and ON)... all from the comforts of my computer in Winnipeg... Okay I'm convinced it is a good thing!  Again I'm at the office on a Saturday... this time though, it is for the purpose of the blog.  Great, now I am so curious and amazed that you all are taking the time to read my rambling words, that I leave the house on a Saturday!!!! to see and read what you all have to say.  I know what you are thinking... get a life... yeah well, no comment!  I'm sure many of you have heard about the fire in the Cold Storage Building on HIggins.  I live blocks from this smoldering structure and everything I own now smells like I've been at a bon fire!  It's a great smell when you are camping!  It is not a great smell when you are heading to the mall and you notice everyone on the bus or in the hallways turning their heads and shaking them in udder dismay!  I have this perfume that I love to wear, so I put it on this morning hoping to mask the smoke smell... needless to say it is not mixing well!  Yesterday, I was sitting celebrating my birthday with some friends at a restaurant (that served Coke by the way!!) and I was painfully aware of the stench of smoke on my clothes.  That might just explain why I kept finding people moving away from me...ah that was it!  No seriously though, it is so thick in the North point Douglas area.  Again this morning, as I looked out the window, I wasn't sure if it was cloud cover or smoke cover. They are supposed to demo it in the next little while... and in the meantime, I guess we crawl on the floor and cover our mouths with wet paper towels!  Anyway, have a great Manitoba hot summer Saturday!!! (for those of you not in MB, it is the coldest summer on record since 1950... fun fun fun!)

      The irony of this makes me laugh.  As I said earlier I have been fasting diet coke, but for part of this week, I was allowing myself to have it... Well, I went out for lunch yesterday with the staff and very triumphantly and with great excitement ordered a diet coke. the response?  "Is Diet Pepsi okay?"  Is Diet Pepsi okay?!?!? Was he crazy?  could he tell by the sudden fire in my eyes that it wasn't okay?  Did he realize that at any moment I was going to jump from my chair and attack him?  Is Diet Pepsi okay... unbelievable.  Nathan, senseing my utter desperateness and dismay asked if he could go get one and bring it in... the waiter said NO!! Can you believe it?!?!  I was in shock.  So rather than this waiter apologizing, he aske again..."Is Diet Pepsi okay?"  I'm sure that the glare he received from me could have melted rock, but I simply said... no, I'll just have water thankyou.  After recovering from that fiasco (spelling?) I went out for supper with a friend and wouldn't you know it, they also only had Pepsi.  All is not lost however.  I knew we were going to a movie, so I calmed myself by reminding myself that the theatre would have Coke and I could get a LARGE!!! Well, we went to the Globe theatre in Portage Place... sure enough... Pepsi.  Happy Birthday to me!  I know what you are thinking, man this girl likes Diet Coke... let me just say this... I could quit if I wanted to...

      33 years ago today, in a small Northern community called Cold Lake, Alberta, a little 6lb 5oz baby was born into the world... little Joyska Johanna... and the world will never be the same!  Yes, today is my birthday.  Yes today I am 33.  How did I get to be 33?!? I don't feel 33, I don't think I look 33, but if I do the math, (let's see 2004 minus 1971 = 33...yep, there is no denying it)well you get the picture.  It's always a wierd feeling to wake up on your birthday.  Today is all about me (i wish!) is the first thought, and then I remember that today I have an all day staff meeting, and that today I still have bills to pay and work to do... wouldn't it be awesome if when our birthday came around we would have an automatic holiday from anything and everything mundane, and all that would happen is excitement and fun?  I think that would make birthdays worthwhile.  But here I am, at the office at 8:00 am so I could write this blog entry and share my birthday thoughts with all of you.  All kidding aside, this year feels exciting.  There are lots of new things on the horizon, and I feel healthy, I have a new and renewed hunger for Jesus, and for the next three days only... I can drink Diet Coke again!  Ah... life is good.    Here is the princess bride quote of the day:  "I do not envy you the headache you will have when you awake, but in the meantime..."  What's the rest of it?

      It's early in the morning and I once again in the building all alone... I don't understand why no one else is here... I mean it is 7:42 am, you guys are up and working already aren't you?  I have this gorgeous view out of my window of the yellow brick building, trees and an amazing blue sky. There are also bars on my window not to mention the window is high and long... much like a prison cell... hmmmm, interesting!  Thankfully, I have the key to my door!  For those of you who know and remember Becky, she is in England now and doing well.  She was offered another part time job to work with some of the kids she used to work with.  She is very excited and she is getting paid to do it!  In our line of work that is not always assumed...   I was at the Guse' yesterday for an amazing Pig roast and was once again amazed at the hospitality of the Guseses (think Gulum as you pronounce that... hobbitses, Guseses...) At one point there were 14 children in the living room alone!  Not to mention the basement, the pool, and the playstructures!  So I figure there were 30 adults and 60 kids!  Okay, not quite, but it was truly amazing and a lot of fun!  Nothing profound to share today... have a great one!

      Okay, so I have obviously hit  a nerve with in the community.  The Princess Bride (TPB) was made in what year?  Was the book as funny as the movie?  These are all questions to test the metal of you so-called fans... Here is yet a couple more...  What was the name of the country that they were trying to frame? and what opened the door to the torture chamber?  Well, on another topic... I came across a really great verse the other day that I am sharing with lots of people because it so encouraged me and will hopefully encourage you as well...  Philippians 2:13 (NLT) For God is working in you, giving you the desire to obey him and the power to do what pleases him.  I believe the verse in NIV says something like to will and to do his perfect will.   I was once again struck by his gracious heart for those of us who are weak!  He gives us the desire to obey him, and then because he knows the human heart he gives us the POWER to do what pleases him!  So if you are anyhting like me, knowing the desire and the power comes from Christ, it just takes the pressure off a little from it needing to be my own personal willpower to do what is right and to follow all that he has for me.  In fact the way I read it, it has very little to do with me at all. It is more being open to placing myself again and again in a place where he can speak, i can listen and forever be changed!  So again, if you are at all like me... be encouraged!  So finish this quote... Buttercup:"We'll never make it!" To which Wesley responds...  Have a great day!
