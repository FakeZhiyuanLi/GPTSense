      speeking to millions of people, john kerry, and others at the dpc have lots of subjects to cover in their speech's. and i know when the rpc comes around, george w. (the best pres ever!!! fact) will do the same thing when talking to all the people.. However i think it is so funny that we listen to them thinking they really know what the important issues are to us as spares in the usa.  so what i really have found out durring this time is that if your a motovational speeker you can run for pres and you might win..  i just glade that bill o'riley or michele more are not running for office because they have too many opinions that we all do not want to hear.. i want americans to know that if i am pres i will cut taxes and lower health costs for those that cant afford it.. blah blah blah. i want a man running for office to tell me the truth, tell me that when you get to office you'll look at the tax crap and try to find a way to cut them if it will work. if i cant then we might raise taxes if that is what it takes to get this country out of debt.       i have to say that there is one part of john kerry was saying that i hate, he wants stim cell reserch. (not good) i dont have ther time nor will i take the time to go into why i dont like that , i just want you all to think for yourselves, make your own  minds and really look at what that would mean in your lives....  we have souls people...use them.  love to all.......................................out

      OKAY, I JUST GOT MY APPLE POWERBOOK G4 AND I LOVE IT. IT IS SLEEK AND SMOOTH AND I LOVE ALL THAT IT OFFERS TO THE MOVIE EDDITING WORLD.      I HAVE ALWAYS OWNED PC'S AND HAVE ENJOYED THE EASY TO USE SCREENS AND USER FRIENDLY PROGRAMS. I WANT TO LET EVERYONE KNOW I HAVE FOUND THAT APPLE HAS REALLY MADE A GREAT STEP IN THE "USER FRIENDLY" WORLD. I THINK THIS APPLE HAS MORE TO OFFER ANYONE THAT IS LOOKING TO BUY A NEW COMPUTER.  I CAN TAKE VIDEO ALL DAY AND THEN BY THE END OF THE NIGHT I HAVE A DVD MOVIE THAT I CAN EDIT AND BURN FOR WORK, OR JUST FOR FUN. I FIND THAT VERY COOL DUE TO I HAVE A NEW BABY IN THE HOUSE, AND I LIKE TAKING VIDEO OF HER AND SHOWING HER TO THE WORLD. ALSO THE ITUNES AND IPHOTO ARE VERY EASY TO USE FOR THE SAME THINGSS....... REALLY INTRUELY ONLY 2% OF THE COMPUTER WORLD IS MAC AND THAT MAKES FOR VERY FEW HACKERS, ECT...  NO PROBLEMS..  ICHAT WORKS GREAT FOR THE FAMILY THAT LIVES ACCROSS THE WORLD SO EVERYONE CAN SEE US AND THE BABY...  I DONT KNOW REALLY ... ALL I KNOW IS I LOVE MY NEW MAC...............DONT THINK I WILL BE CALLED FOR A COMERCIAL ANYTIME SOON....  STAY HARD.

      This Concern Anyone About The Candidate?    John Kerry on Defense -- I hadn't seen this list printed until  today. It would make one heck of a mailer if it were sent to  voters. (So..Copy and paste... send it to as many voters as you can!)    He voted to kill the Bradley Fighting Vehicle He voted to kill the M-1 Abrams Tank He voted to kill every Aircraft carrier laid down from 1988 He voted to kill the Aegis anti aircraft system He voted to Kill the F-15 strike eagle He voted to Kill the Block 60 F-16 He voted to Kill the P-3 Orion upgrade He voted to Kill the B-1 He voted to Kill the B-2 He voted to Kill the Patriot anti Missile system He voted to Kill the FA-18 He voted to Kill the B-2 He voted to Kill the F117  In short, he voted to kill every military appropriation for the   development and deployment of every weapons systems  since 1988 to include the battle armor for our troops. With  Kerry as president our Army will be made up of naked men  running around with sticks and clubs.  He also voted to kill all anti terrorism activities of every   agency  of the US Government and to cut the funding of the  FBI by 60%, to cut the funding for the CIA by 80%, and cut  the funding for the NSA by  80%.  But then he voted to increase OUR funding for U.N operations  by 800%! Is THIS a President YOU want?

      I am 27 years old, Married, with a 7 week old little girl. I have been working for my dad off and on for about 9.5 years, and now making about low 40's. My wife does not work, we live paycheck to paycheck, And I could not have asked for a better life.        Ofcourse I want more, such as a bigger income so Carly and I did'nt have to worry about bills and New Cars and Trucks when needed (like now). But I'm happy. I want money in the bank for savings for Andie, and Carly, if anything happend to me. But I'm Healthy. I want new clothes for me and my family so we can impress the crowds. But I have nice clothes. I could go on and on but i won't bore you with repitition. I just want to say " when is it enough?".  I really dont think I Could be satisfied with the amount of money I make, But i Can be happy in life with God, Family, and a little Blog to share my most unthoughtout writings.        A better life is easy, Find the girl/guy of your dreams. Fall inlove. Get Married, and decide to spend your days loving the eachother as much as possable. don't let the small stuff get inbetween you both, and tarnish what you feel for one another. But don't forget the small stuff too cause thats what brought you together in the first place.  The secret to Happieness : Firm Foundation in Evey part of your Life. (simple but true)

      Well I have been a Dad now for about 5 whole weeks, and what i have found is I am scared i will screw up. The first time we brought her home, Carly (my wife) and I were just thinking to ourselves " What are we going to do." " There is no one to help us on a day to day bases. We felt so unprepared to take care of our sweet lil' Andie. Try to put yourself in our shoes. You have a new baby and everything she needs you have to give her because she cannot get it for herself. THAT IS HUGE!! I know that some of you who might run across this blog and have kids of your own, think i am not doing it justice, and others think i am making this too big. Well, lucky me this is my blog. Well, I have you know that when we got home the "AUTO PARENT" Kicked in for both Carly and I. Carly knew autopmaticly when and how much to feed her, and learnd her cries. Yes there are diffrent Cries. I did not know this at first, most of what i have learnd about kids has come from my wife, SHE IS SO GREAT!     So if you are thinking of having a baby and your only fea is being able to take care of him or her, dont sweat it, it all comes in time, and what you dont know dont be assamed to ask.... we all need help sometimes..   Funny, the best person to ask too is your floks.  And as parents we need to realise that this is our first time to be parents and their first time to be kids, so misstaks are allowd..  -C

      Okay, Just got through reading my  urlLink best friend's blog . He was writing about his job in the food industry.  He says everyone should leave 20% tip on dinner.. WHAT! Why? When i goout to eat It is the servers JOB TO SERVE ME AND THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO AREWITH ME. THE END. It is my job from that point to determine how much I FEELLIKE THEY DESERVE. IF a server does his job good he/she will get 15%, HOWEVERif that server does the job AWESOME(very rear,,,,, VERY) 20% is called for......Alsorare I will get the bad "skateboard man " server who sucks and he/she gets0-5%... Just do your job ... If you want more money ,,, do it well....    thanks.
