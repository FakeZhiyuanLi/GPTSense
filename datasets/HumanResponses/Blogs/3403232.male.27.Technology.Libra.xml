       urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4980465/    This is a very entertaining idea on how to fix the next star wars movie.  I personally think Ang Lee would be a great director for the third one.  Anyone but George Lucas.  Its sad how terrible the newest Star Wars movies have been.  But when you go back and watch the first 3 they weren't a lot better.  Mark Hamill was awful.  Better than Haden Christiansen, but still awful.  I think we were all a lot younger and dumber back then so they just seemed better.  It wouldn't hurt to bring back the bad ass guy with the horns and the cool light saber either

      Seeing as all you readers on the internet just met me I should give you a little background about me.  Not to mention it will clear up many questions about all the things I am bitching about.  Here we go:   My Job   For about the last 3 years I have been working at LabCorp in Burlington, NC as a software developer.  I actually like being a software developer most of the time.  The problem is that I hate LabCorp.  Its not even LabCorp that's the problem so much as its my boss, and his boss, and his boss.  My boss is a complete idiot.  He has no idea what it is he is doing, or what I'm supposed to be doing.  Consequently it seems my main job is keeping my chair from floating away.  Since my boss doesn't know what I do he can't make any decisions about what I should be doing with my time.  And he doesn't believe me when I tell him what I should do so I continue to hold down my chair.  The worst part of all this is the meetings.  The endless, pointless meetings.  We have meetings all the time to discuss things we discussed in other meetings last week.  And the week before.  And the week before that.  And the week before that.  Apparently since he can't decide what we should do he just figures if we talk about it enough things will solve themselves.  Unfortunately for me I live in an area with a large population of hyper-educated people.  Many of whom are unemployed.  This makes it very difficult for me to get a new job because all the companies that are hiring have a bunch of candidates with masters degrees (and no actually useful knowledge).  And then there's me, I have no degree in anything so everyone just assumes I'm stupid.  I have a whole other rant about that little socially accepted bigotry.  But I'll save it for later.  So I keep looking for a job and saving my money in case I need to quit this one to save my sanity.  I'm pretty sure the day is coming that I will have to do that.  I'm not normally a violent person but some days I just want to beat the shit out of my boss when he says something stupid.  Which just so happens to be every time his mouth is moving.   It looks like this background is going to take quite a few posts to get it all in.  The really long part is going to be about my love life which is horribly complicated thanks to all the insane girls I end up dating.  I guess I will tackle that one next.

      So here I am writing down my thoughts for the rest of the internet to ignore.  Its kind of fun to have them out there, even though its unlike that anyone will see this because I won't tell anyone about it.  Most people who know me get to hear me bitching enough without having to subject to them it in written form.  The important thing to know about me is that I am bored a lot.  I mean 8 hours a day.  Which oddly enough coincides with the 8 hours a day I spend at work.  This blog could now afford me a venue for some fun stream of conciousness stuff.  Which will be interesting coming from me at work.  Probably filled with lots of things about what an idiot my boss is.  Or what a shitty town Burlington, NC is.  I expect a lot of bitching will be done about the women in my life as well.  You see besides being devilishly good looking I am also afflicted with the nice guy syndrome.  So far it has brought me nothing but headaches.  I expect more to be coming in the near future as well.  Pages more to come on that at some later date.  Now I have to take a shower because its really hot.
