      Last night was my final lesson on leadership for our high school huddle group.  I started back in March and after eight weeks we have finished.  We had six lessons on leadership and there were two weeks when we took a break.  Overall I think the study went well, but last night was incredible.  Last night our students opened up and shared how they could improve there leadership at school and in our group.  It was an amazing time of confession and reflection.  I am so proud of that group and how much they continue to grow!    I have to admit that these lessons came, because of a graduate school project I was doing.  In the project I only had to do two and have them evaluate the lessons.  We decided as a youth ministry team to do all six during our huddle time.  I am so excited about how God will use these specific teens for His glory through leadership.  Praise God for youth ministry!  On another note, I am still working on my sermon and it is coming along nicely.  I will be exploring the "Danger Zone".  This is the fourth of five sermons that revolve around peer evangelism.  The Danger Zone is the place of fear and uncomfortableness that keeps us from sharing Christ with our loved ones, co-workers, and neighbors.  I am excited about this sermon and continue to pray for God's words, not mine.  I will be out the next couple of days from blogging.  My wife and I are celebrating our one-year anniversary this weekend.  The actual date was April 12, and no I didn't forget.  We were just busy, so we waited for our free weekend.  I will post again on Monday.  Have a great weekend!  -Michael

      Today I am in the midst of ministry busy-ness.  I don't usually like to talk about how busy I am, because it always seems like an excuse or a sympathy trip.  However, I have that overwhleming feeling today and needed to blog to release.  I am teaching junior high boys this Sunday morning, leading worship at both services, and preaching Sunday evening.  The sermon isn't written and other things are coming up as I write.  So what does a youth minister do in the throws of being overwhelmed.  He emails his wife!  Leah, is my sweetheart and has been for over four years.  She gives me support and encouragement every day!  She emailed me back and said, "song leading and preaching! wow. ur busy. u will get it done u always do".  It may not be a long message, but the meaning behind her words calmed me and gave me perspective.  Two perspectives:  1.  She loves me and realizes that I have gifts and abilities.  You cannot make it through ministry without the love and support of spouses, friends, and family.  A support system is vital to life and to ministry.  Leah, is my strongest support system and my best friend!  My other support systems include the other ministers on staff, my accountability partners, my family (parents and in-laws), friends, and my mentors.  As I learned five years ago from  urlLink Mike Cope , if you want to stay in ministry long term you need support systems.  Today four and half years into ministry, I am glad I learned from his wisdom.  Thanks, Mike  2.  The second perspective from her short note is that everything I do, is not about me, but about God.  She says you will get it done, you always do.  Well, I know that from Leah this means that God has seen me through some difficult times.  This is nothing compared to what God has done in the past and will do in the future.  God is bigger than busy-ness and God is bigger than time.  His message will come even if I freak out for a moment with being overwhelmed.  He is a great God!  He will see us through all things of life and into eternal life!  You just have to love the fact that an insignificant piece of time, such as being overwhelmed with writing a sermon, can produce so many insights into ministry and into God.  May your day be blessed as you seek Him today!  -Michael

      Well...this is my first blog ever!  I have viewed this site many times wondering what could I possibly write about everyday.  I have decided that the world of youth ministry is such a fascinating universe, that all should know more about it.  Some would say that it is merely entertaining youth in a Christian environment.  Some would say it is the foundation for adolescent faith unleashed.  I would say that it is an adventure of adolescence that can only make every individual involved grow in their faith.  Students are challenged with their faith for seven intense years.  Then the proving ground of leaving home challenges their every move.  I am here, not to babysit or to merely entertain.  I am here to teach, model, and shape faith of teenagers as I grow in faith as well.  Welcome to the adventures in youth ministry!  May God Bless us each and every one!  -Michael

      Friday is usually my day off.  Today I will get most of it.  I didn't finish yesterday a sermon for Sunday, so I will be working today.  However, I think I can get more done at home.  It will require some time at the office though.  They say that ministry is a 24/7 job.  However, rest should not only be required from leadership, but encouraged.  I am thrilled that my elders find it beneficial to have a day off.  Most of the time I take it, but when I don't I make sure I get rest another day.  I will be out of blogging the rest of today and tomorrow.  Be back on Monday!  -Michael

      I had some real Holy time yesterday.  Mike Cope mentions this kind of time in his blog a lot.  I had the privilege and opportunity to experience it yesterday.  I spent a couple of hours yesterday with two men from our congregation that I respect and adore, Bob Cayce and Paul Arnold.  These men and I loaded, moved, and unloaded an information booth for our church.  I am not sure why I was asked to help.  The only reason I can see is that, I had the time.  Both of whom are grandparents out-muscled me in every way.  Mostly, I just appreciated the time to be with them and learn from their wisdom, contentment, love, and joy of life.  I hope one day to be a follower of Jesus such as them.  Praise God for these two men and for giving me time yesterday to experience His holiness.  Holy time didn't stop there, I then spent a great dinner with a well-loved family of mine "The Browns".  It was Addison's birthday, he is 17.  We ate all of his favorites that Andrea cooked.  It is always holy time to spend dinner with this family.  When I was single they treated me as part of their family and now that I am married, they include both me and Leah.  I love them!  But wait, there is still more.  I spent time with another man at my church.  Bill.  Bill and Laura have five children, two of which are adopted from Russia.  Bill and I spent an hour talking about family and his kids.  Three of his children are in the youth group.  Then there was the highlight of my day.  I came home after work and Leah I spent our evening on the couch, T.V. off, just talking about our days and everything in life.  I don't know if I have mentioned this in my blog before, but I love her!  And it's conversations like last night that helped us fall in love and its conversations like last night that make that love grow deeper.  Definitely Holy Time!  I didn't get my sermon writtten yesterday or my class for high school done.  And there were other things that were postponed, but being in that kind of holiness, helps you to see what's important!  -Michael

      I realized today that I have some hard conversations ahead of me.  I like it when things go smoothly.  And for the most part of this year that has been the story.  However, there are those times when things don't go as planned and people are hurt, confused, angry, or misinformed.  Today, I am in prayer for those that I must talk with and myself.  I may not enjoy the conversation, but not having it will most definitely start a disastrous situation.  Youth ministry isn't always about cool trips, fun weekends, and ice cream parties.  It is about ministering to students and their families.  This means sometimes getting "spiritually dirty."  This is where we have to rebuke, confront, and listen.  This is where we teach, encourage, and direct faith.  If youth ministry was always on "cruise control" where would be the excitement, the passion, the valleys.    Am I desiring these coversations?  Am I ready for these conversations?  No, no.  However, I am a living prayer until it happens.  It now is out of my hands and in the Lord's.  Thank God, because otherwise I would mess it all up.  Give praise to the Lord, for He is holy!  On another note:  Life is treating me extremely well.  My blessings: My wife, my mom, my church family, pulpit minister, staff, elders.  Gifts of administration, speaking, and wisdom.  My physical needs are taken care of.  I continue to grow in Christ, despite my continued sin.  Grace is a blessing.  My wife is my biggest earthly blessing I have.  She continues to be my strength and source of strongest encouragement.  I love her!  God is so Good!  -Michael

      I had to leave for an appointment earlier.  I just wanted to finish by saying that ministry cannot be learned merely through class instruction.  I cherish my classroom instruction, however, my training through internships helped me get my job and have a better understanding of what ministry is.  The year-round internship I think is the best because you see youth ministry in all its seasons.  Well, that's my rant!  -Michael

      I just got back from a meeting with other youth ministers in Houston.  After our meeting we went to eat lunch.  We talked about many things, but the best was horror stories of interns.  Thankfully, I don't have any to share.   I have been blessed to have two awesome interns in the past and without the summer even being here, I know I have an excellent intern on the way.  It reminded me of my own intern days.  Some were pretty tough, others quite easy.  I had four summer internships and every school year at ACU I worked year-round with Highland Church of Christ as their intern.   The blessings from field training and hands-on learning is more than I can explain.  Well I gotta go.  -Michael

      Disappointment came quickly and swiftly yesterday.  I had submitted an article to a well-known youth ministry journal.  They gave me a short deadline and I was honored to write the article.  Once the article was written and submitted, I waited.  While I waited, I began to work myself up about being published and reading my article in an actual published journal.  I guess you could say I was becoming pretty proud of myself.  The journal came yesterday and my article was nowhere to be found.  I lowered my head and decided to appoint an amount of time to mourn.  I gave myself the rest of the evening. So, between 4pm (when I found out) and 8pm I mourned.  This wasn't the greatest disappointment of my life, nor of most people's lives, however, the way we treat a little instance prepares us for the larger trials in life.  I have been told since I was kid that it's okay to cry and also to "walk it off" (get over it).  Sometimes we treat these responses to circumstances as either, or.  I believe that we should use both, especially in times of disappointment and discouragement.    In youth ministry there will be many times of disappointment and discouragement.  The best thing we can do is to remain positive and focused on the bigger picture.  How many times have I done that?  Seldom.  However, after going through a recent period of discouragement (8 months lasting) I have realized that it is more healthy for me to appoint a time to mourn, then refocus and renew.  I mourn by crying, sulking, talking (negatively), and being sarcastic.  I then have a transition time where I divert my attention to something entirely different, meditate, and pray.  Then as my time ends and I start the renewal process I worship, meditate, refocus, and exchange bitterness for optimism.  This is how  I  survive discouragement.  It may be different for you.  However, this seems to work for me, so far.  If you are young in ministry have a plan for discouragement.  Read Doug Fields book "Your first two years in Ministry". You can check out his website at   urlLink Doug Fields .  In chapter 2 he talks exclusively about discouragement.  It put many things into perspective for me.  A little quote to hook you in from his book is, "God may be using periods of discouragement to take your life and your ministry to a deeper and better place."  (p. 49)  In reflection of all that I have written.  I am in a good place today!  A place of worship and focus of God.  Today begins a period of my ministry and life with Christ reaching a better place.  My only hope is that the same will happen for you.

      Monday is here and Sunday is over.  I feel like I can breathe again.  It was such a wonderful day.  Worship went well, Junior High Boys class went well, my youth team meeting went well, and preaching went well.  Everything was worth the time, energy, and later exhaustion.  Thank you for your prayers.  Leah and I got the opportunity to visit the Bob Bullock Texas History Musuem in Austin this past weekend.  This was an amazing musuem.  Rich in Texas history (my favorite).  We learned about the Indians, conquistadores, settlers, civil wars, flags, Alamo, Texas as a Nation, Oil and more.  They had wonderful exhibits and stories (we sprang the two bucks for the audio tour).  I was reminded of my own history.   I was reminded of Leah's.  I was reminded of our church's history.  We have a rich history as a church and youth ministry is now old enough to have its own history.  Our place in that history is vitally important whether we think so or not.  We are all a part of the Kingdom story.  We are all a part of  HIStory .  Praise God for that!  On another note:  Youth ministries all over the nation are beginning to gear up for their summer program.  I am excited about the camps and mission opportunities that we have this summer.  However, the most exciting thing to me about the summer is that I have more relational time with the students.  I can never get enough of relational ministry.  I respect the place of management, organization, planning, and office time, but there is a special place in my heart, just to be able to sit and talk with a student about everything or nothing.   Only 35 days for us!  Come on Summer!

      This is the day that the Lord has made!  I will rejoice and be exceedinly glad!  Praise God even for this gloomy, muggy, wet day.  All glory and praise to the Father!  Can you tell I got away for two days?  We had a great time and I didn't realize how much I needed it until I was on the way back.  What a blessing getaway trips can be.  God is merciful and loving to us all!  I needed these past two days, because of the load I had taken two weeks previously.  I was singed.  Singed?  Yeah, singed!  In my days at college (I'm sounding old, but college was only 5 years ago) the buzz was how to do ministry without burning out.  Many ministers were lasting on average 2 years in youth ministry and less than 18 months at one church.  My plea to the Clear Lake church during the interview process was to not become burned out.  I want a long and healthy career.  Thank God, He heard my prayer and my church has heard that call as well.  Burn out has been reduced in ministry or maybe just prolonged, with the averages of length and stay becoming longer.  However, if you get to close to the fire and burn, you can get singed?  When I was around 9 I got into quite a bit of trouble and usually at my dad's house.  My step-mother could tell you some stories!  One day I was at my granny's house and my brother and I went to go burn the trash.  She lived out in the country so this wasn't just legal, but expected.  My brother and I like most little boys loved fire.  So, we didn't just burn the trash, we also played with the fire.  At one point it got a little out of hand, we contained it and then went back into the house.  I noticed my hair felt funny.  I went to my stepmother and told her that my hair had spiderwebs in it.  She looked and knew immediately that I didn't have spiderwebs in my hair, it was singed.  Of course we then got a lecture, and then teased the rest of our years.  The hair grows back normal, but it takes a while.  Being singed is one way to be warned of a burn.  In fact it is a slight burn itself.  In ministry we are getting better about not burning out, however, we must be careful of being singed.  I don't think that I was truly singed before this weekend.  I had taken hours during the day to reflect, but did not have my entire day off as usual.  It is important in ministry to be careful and mindful of those times you are singed.  Because not recognizing the warning signs, could lead to burning out.  My weekend was great and I feel completely refreshed.  Now I can focus and renew my ministry.  May God Bless You in the same way!  Have a great Day!  -Michael

      I am helping my wife today with her Kindergarten's class Mother's Day Tea.  I really enjoy these little ones.  They say the funniest things and don't know how not to love.  I will be out of blogging all next week.  I will be at ACU taking a graduate course.  So I will write again on Monday May 17.  I really enjoy helping my wife with her class.  They say that no matter what you would prefer that as long as you are a minister's wife, you will have to work that ministry as well.  That may be somewhat true, but it is also true of us spouses in ministry to help out the other in their career.  I think this helps build a marriage.  Plus I just love her and love watching her work.  Pray for my studies.  -Michael

      I have a meeting today for Soul Link.  If you are not from this area, probably don't know about it.  Soul Link is a youth event on the first weekend of every March.  It started in 2001 and has grown every year.  I have had the privilege of being a part of Soul Link since 2002.  It is a great "edgy" youth conference.  We have kept some of the traditional pieces such as corporate worship and a key note speaker, but many of the other aspects are very different.  However, the best part about working with Soul Link is working with the other youth ministers on the committee.  I work with some of the most successful and intelligent and gifted youth ministers around.  Bryan Borden, Jason Noble, Jennifer Cooke, Brad Cox, Dustin Bartee, Dave Meredith, Eddie Boyer, Sean Palmer, Brock Paulk, Scott Allen, Tquan Moore, Doug Page, Chad Nall, Tom Kimmey, Curt Grubb, Jeff Philips, and many more.  I cherish these meetings, because we are all in the same fight and we really strengthen one another.  In youth ministry it is important not only to have friends that you can confide in (like I have talked about before), but also to work with other successful youth ministers.  You can learn so much from being around them and in times of distress your soul can be healed.  You don't have to all think alike (Lord knows we don't), but you must work together.  Find a group of other youth ministers to hang out with and work with.  If you are in a small town, you just might have to branch out of your Church of Christ comfort zone.  In my opinion you need that to, but I will leave that for another day.  May your day be blessed in whatever ministry you have today!  May you see God and be blessed by His love!  -Michael

      Yesterday afternoon I went to U of H main campus to take the MAT test.  100 analogy questions.  I may be writing about it later again, because it seems I may take it again.  The test was difficult.  I was a guessing machine.  I know more about the end times than analogies.  I just hope ACU takes a low score.  My scores will take 4 weeks to get.  Which allows me one more course (next week) before they can officialy unenroll me.  I believe that the hardest part of graduate education is getting admitted.  We are tested on many fronts in the world.  People want to know that you can handle the tasks set before you.  They want to know that you have learned from the lessons before.  God tests us in much of the same way.  Every day of youth ministry is a test in patience, faith, and perseverance.  But more than youth ministry is the test God lays before us everyday.  I am glad he doesn't keep score!  He is pleased when we are faithful, and disappointed when we trust ourselves.  His grace and mercy do endure forever.  I continue in my ministry and my faith to stumble and fall.  My eyes strive to remain on him.  However, there are those times, like Peter, I look down.  My goal is to give my hope and faith to the Lord and remain in Him and depend upon the Spirit.  May I be as blessed as Peter to be caught by Christ.  -Michael

      Ecstatic is how you could describe me right now!  I am overjoyed and very humbled today.  My friend Jay called me this morning.  He is a youth minister here in town and we have been friends for five years.  Jay was the one who gave me the news that my article, see my blog from a few days ago, was published online.  The day that I wrote about discouragement and disappointment all surrounded around my article not being published.  Today, God throws a big surprise my way.  My  urlLink article  which was put online today is about story and really our story.    The humbling part of this situation is that I completely had given up that it would be published.  Now, I eat my words and need to reflect on my faith.  God is amazing.  My day has started off better than ever could have been thought.  My amazing God.  Proclaim His name today, for He is good!  I want you to know that this article is not about me, but about what God is doing through me.  I am humbled through his use of me.  I am unworthy and undeserving of his love, care, and grace.  However, I will rejoice in my suffering and weaknesses and will continue to give him praise.  -Michael

      Today has been great but steady.  This weekend was a blessing as well.  We celebrated and honored our graduating seniors.  It was a nice banquet and our Sunday went well.  Next week I will be in Abilene taking a graduate course.  Introduction to youth ministry.  Many people laugh when I tell them.  I may have been doing this for a while, but I am far from knowing everything there is.  Youth ministry changes every day and staying up to date with things can be a challenge.  I am excited about the class and being able to learn more about these adolescents.  Mother's day is approaching which means two things for me.  1.  Leah and I have the opportunity to honor our mothers and 2.  Leah's birthday is right around the corner.  I will get in from my class the day after her birthday.  But that's okay, because we will truly celebrate when I get back.  She is so supportive and understanding.  I pray that God will help me to be half the spouse she is to me.  Youth ministry will soon take off for the summer.  I praise God for my job and the joy of serving him daily!  -Michael

      In about 10 minutes our early service will begin.  I am preaching today.  It is our senior Sunday and so I have asked to speak.  At first I thought I might speak about seniors or the journey of moving through life.  However, there are 500 people at our church and less than half are connected to the youth.  So, in the best interest of everyone, I have decided to speak on family.  It will be about journey through life; my journey through different family stages.  I know God will help things go well.  I am not afraid, for the Lord is with me.  I may get a little nervous right before I speak, but preaching comes naturally these days.  I believe it's easier to preach and there are less obstacles when you only preach every now and then and when you are the "guest" preacher.  I do enjoy preaching, but youth ministry is where my heart and passion is at.  May the Lord be praised today!  -Michael

      Hey, I'm back.  I am in class right now, actually on break.  We are having a really good study and just thought I would check email.  After battling an entire technological conspiracy against me, I have finally been able to log in on ACU's computers and do so.  It is rare for me to hear the things I am in class.  This has been great stuff.  Information about generations, post modernism, and how we deal with this current youth culture is quite refreshing.  I hope to share more when I have more time.  -Michael

      Since January I have been preaching on every 4th Sunday evening of the month.  It is a series called "Extending the Hand of Christ".  It is somewhat difficult to have a series just once a month.  However, we have muddled through and managed to keep most of the consistency.  This Sunday is my last of the five sermon series.  I am speaking on how to practically reach others for Christ.  In the past four sermons we have spoke of evangelism through community, Brokenness, Testimony or Witnessing, The Danger Zone (Boldly talking about Christ), and now "how do I extend a hand".  This sermon could be the most difficult of all.  Not to prepare, but to deliver.  I have preached a practical sermon before and it seems there is not as much to say.  Those who know me, will feel comfortable about my ability to be loquacious.  We will see Sunday I guess.  Our Intern will come down this weekend to begin his summer journey.  Blake is a great guy and I am excited to be able to work with him.  I know that through the summer we will both learn from each other.  I have had quite successful interns before.  Jay is now a youth minister in Houston and Mark is in graduate school.  They are not successful just for how they turned out, but more of how they brought along our group.  Interns take the mundane and make it exciting.  They build relationships within the group that could never have bonded.  They bring a fresh wind to an already burning fire.  I am in prayer that Blake will do the same and I have full hope (confidence or expectation) that our group will be blessed and grow because of his leadership.  To God be the Glory -Michael

      I am back in the office today.  I feel somewhat refreshed after being in graduate school all last week.  I had a great time there.  The things that I have been hearing about postmodernism now makes sense.  I tried to implore some of my newfound knowledge at a Parent's meeting yesterday.  I wasn't that idiot who takes what he has learned and decides to teach everyone the same.  I simply took a different perspective than usual.  My teacher was not just a professor.  He wasn't just a former youth minister.  He was also the parent of three teenage boys.  His poor wife!  Having that Parent/youth minister perspective was one of the most helpful things of the class.  So, yesterday at the Parent's meeting, I tried not to act like I knew their children better than them.  I tried to be sensitive to their perspectives as parents.  It can sometimes be quite the balancing act.  There is a need to act professional and appear to have everything nailed down, while at the same time leaving room for the Parents to have a voice.    I try to make it my practice to give the Parents a voice.  However, my self-centered and prideful stance of "having it all together" squashes those attempts at times.  Hopefully, the Lord will continue to teach and humble me through great men like, Steve Joiner.  On another note: I am back in the office today.  College students are back.  Youth group wants to eat lunch.  An elder wants to meet.  Two Bible classes and a sermon to prepare.  Articles to read and reviews to write. A life to live. Prayers to pray.  Salvation to work out (with fear and trembling).      An enemy to defeat.  A wife to love. A God to engage.    Praise the Lord for His Love Endures Forever!  -Michael

      Today is my day off.  So far I have mowed, edged, and weed eated the lawn.  I have fertilized the lawn and went to walmart to buy some more lawn stuff.  I am about to go back a water the lawn.  I still have to finish laundry, dishes, and pack for next week.  Man I love a day off!  I will be out all next week on a youth trip.  I will be camping and not anywhere near a computer.  So starting today I will not be blogging until June 7.    Pray for our trip!  Tell you all about it when I get home!  -Michael

      Our ministry said goodbye to two of our students last night.  Two or our junior high students are moving away this summer.  One is leaving before Sunday, the other in July.  We decided to honor both with one party.  One of the things we did was have two journals, one for each, and let the students write a goodbye note to them.  It was difficult to write that note.  Both of these students are good kids who have been a great asset to our group.  I hate to see them go.  However, my prayer is that God will use them wherever they land.  Yesterday, was almost like a summer day.  The high school students get out at 11:30am because of finals.  So we had about 10 of us who went to lunch together.  Some decided to hang around with Blake and play basketball, while I got some needed office work done.  Later we went to Sam's.  We needed some stuff for our vending machines and then supplies for the party last night.  It is so great to spend time with students doing everyday normal activity.  You really get to know them and see their personalities.  My rigid, conservative side cringes at some of the things they do.  I have to keep reminding myself that riding on the cart at Sams is not that big of deal, and it really can be funny.  Adolescents can take the most mundane activity and make it fun.  I wish sometimes that we adults could throw back some of our adult inhibitions and find fun in everything.  I wish we could quit coating life with so many rules and learn the joy of life again.  However, there is safety to think about, reputation, decorum, proper behavior, and responsibility.  But what about fun?  How many parents of adolescents are making it a priority to have fun with their children?  How many adults, period, are making it a priority to have fun?  I think that is one of the reasons I like being a youth minister.  Although, my goal of ministry is not to have fun but to transform adolescents into Christ, the students in my ministry make it fun anyway.  They realize, what sometimes we adults have forgotten, that Christianity is fun, joyous, and a constant celebration.  Have a fun day!  -Michael

      Astros 5 Cubs   0  I wouldn't normally care at this point in the season about this particular game, but its different when you are at the ballpark.  Leah and I were offered free tickets from another couple to enjoy the game.  All four of us met and went to our seats.  Behind home plate in the field boxes.  Close enough to see the details of the players, but high enough that a foul ball would potentially come over the net into our row.  I was proud of my Astros and their swift play. They played hard, made some outstanding efforts and were never in jeopardy of losing.  They pitched well, hit well, and ran well.  All in all it was a great night for the Astros.  Of course with any competition there is a winner and a loser.  The Cubs (unfortunate if you are a cub fan) lost last night and even worse didn't score a point.  They were struck out over 10 times and only received a few hits.  You could say it wasn't a good night for the cubs.  Towards the end of the game, the top of the ninth with two outs and no one on base, I began to wonder.  I looked at the batter at the on-deck circle.  I wondered, does he really think that he is going to get up to bat with two outs already?  Do the cubs think they can actually still win this game?  Are the Astros confident of victory?  In Christ we should be confident of our victory.  However, it is the everday battles that sometimes can overwhelm us.  When things look as if Satan has won the battle, we should have the faith that says, "No way, through Christ I will win today"  But even if we do lose the battle, we have definitely won the war.  We can be confident of that because of Christ's blood shed on the cross and His resurrection from the dead.  Christ 5 Satan  0  Who's team do you want to be on?  -Michael

      Yesterday Blake and I went through some orientation about the summer.  Today we will finish that up, hopefully before noon.  I try to take my first hour of the day to write in my blog, because I get interrupted the least at that time.  I started some of my graduate school assignments yesterday.  The article that I am in the middle of reviewing is one about the history of youth ministry and its place in education.  Had I been able to know where youth ministry had been, I believe that I would have been better prepared for full time youth ministry.  I like history.  I wouldn't say I am a history buff, but if there were one school subject that I would like to teach in public school it would be history.  I can imagine myself at those times and try to discern how I would have reacted to the times and what my place would have been.  Of course in the same flash of moment I realize that what I do in the present will one day be history.  A better question is What am I doing today, that will impact tomorrow?  I am not all that interested in making the history books (even those on the history of youth ministry), however, I am interested in being able to be used by God in the present to influence someone's future.  We are history in the making.  What are you doing today that will impact tomorrow?  Who can you hand down your legacy of faith?  Whose personal unwritten history book will you be in?  I hope to be in Leah's, my future children, some of my youth group students, my friends, my parents, my church.  I want to make an impact for God.  The only way to do so is to follow His will!  Reflect on your future history and impact someone for God's glory today!  -Michael

      I am wearing shorts today!  I decided last Friday, that this was the week I make the transition from pants to shorts.  Life as a youth minister is great!  Summer is Awesome!  And God...well, God is just Amazing!  -Michael

      Where have I been?  It was at some point of each day Wednesday and Thursday that I remembered that I had not written in my blog.  I apologize for those who are faithful readers (mom).  Last week was a great week.  Our intern arrived on Friday and we got him settled in his host home.  Blake (our intern) and I left for a leadership retreat that same day.  The elders, deacons, and ministers of our church got together for Friday and Saturday to pray over our congregation and spend time in meditation with God.  We have around 600 members on our roster and they were prayed for three different times this past weekend.  Some we knew and some we didn't.  Blake is pretty amazing, because he didn't know anyone, yet prayed sincerely for them.  That takes a lot of character.  This is going to be a great summer!  I am in a youth ministry slump right now.  I am at one of those discouragement points.  Some of the students in my ministry are lazy and indifferent.  They are not stirred about anything and are so self-centered, they won't help anyone.  It is causing me much anguish and once again I question my role.  I have until 10:00am today to sulk and live in the discouragement.  Then it will be time for me to completely hand it over to God and let him deal with the issue.  In youth ministry these cycles happen.  I usually call them spurts.  Our group will have a spurt of energy and want to do everything and are excited about everything, ready and willing to serve.  Then, like now, they will go through a funk and be completely apathetic.  I do remember though, it is in this time God is doing His most amazing work.  Pray for my heart and this group.  Today I start orientation with Blake and we get to go through the ins and outs of the daily routine.  We will discuss class, office time, student time, trips, and other things.  I have blocked off the entire week to do so, but I am thinking that one to two days will be sufficient.  I can't wait for summer.

      It is 10:30pm and I am 1 hour and a half from taking our senior trip.  No I didn't get the time wrong.  We leave at 12:01am.  Donna drives and I sleep.  Then when she gets tired, I drive and she sleeps.  We should make our destination by 10am tomorrow.  I am excited about our trip.  I always look forward to this time with the seniors.  I will miss my wife!  But I always do when I am away from home.  I will tell you were I've been when I get back.  I don't apologize for the secrecy.  It's partly tradition and partly fun!  The students will be arriving shortly.  It's time to pray for the journey.  I will be away from blogging until June 7.  See ya then!  -Michael

      Just to let you know, last night's class went better than I could have ever expected.  The two seniors who spoke did and excellent job.  The class worshipped with heart, and the prayer groups went well also.  Praise God!  My Memaw emailed me yesterday!  I was surprised, because I don't get many personal emails from family.  Just to hear what she was doing and how much she loved me brought me to tears.  I love my Memaw.  She has been a wonderful grandmother to me and all her other grandchildren.  One thing I can say about her is that she would give all she had for us.  Whether we deserved it or not, she would give her last dollar, her own personal time, and all of her heart.  She loves the Lord just like her father before her.  Both my Memaw and her dad (Papa) are the same about giving.   I have heard many stories about Papa picking up strangers, preaching for preacherless churches, and other escapades of service.  My Memaw hasn't missed a beat.  She is the same.  Papa went to meet the Lord in 1982 I believe.  I remember him well and miss him.  I may not have known him very well, but his legacy of faith continues to be passed down from him, to Memaw, to my mom, and now to me.  One day to my children.  I can't say that I am the kind of giver that Papa and Memaw are.  Maybe one day I can let go of financial fears and be free to give more.  Maybe one day I can leave behind my planner and give more time.  Maybe one day I will be a Jesus in the flesh to the generations below me that Papa, Memaw, and Mom have been to me.  Praise God for grandparents.  Praise God for Memaw!  On another note: Today I must get my Sunday lesson done, finalize the order of worship for Sunday, eat lunch with my students, and tie up any loose ends of the week.  So it's back to work!  -Michael

      In our Wednesday night class tonight we are doing something new.  Actually we started it last week, but it is something we haven't ever done before.  We are calling it "Youth Memorials".  The schedule of the class is this.  We use the first part of class to do introductions.  We have put together a funny and serious form for every student to fill out.  Then we will introduce 2-3 students every week.  After introductions we worship together.  After worship we have 1-2 students from our ministry tell their story of what excites them about being a Christian.  Then the last part of our class they will break into groups of 3 to pray together.  I am excited about tonight.  Tonight is my first to attend.  Blake led it last week, since I was gone.  I can't wait to hear some of these students tell what excites them about Christ!  On another note:  I have been a little disappointed this summer with our mission trip.  We had a great idea to use some things we learned last week in Atlanta at home this year.  At first we couldn't get our students to commit for one more week away from work and other obligations.  So we shortened it to a three day apartment VBS and service projects throughout the summer.  On Monday the apartment complex revoked their willingness to advertise for us and pretty much their support of  the whole thing.  With that late news, we decided to forgo the VBS for the apartments and make it just a three day service project.  I am in prayer that next year we will be able to take an out of country mission trip as well as do something for our neighborhood.  If you are a member of our church or youth ministry pray that prayer with me.  This is the day that the Lord has made, I will rejoice and be exceedingly glad!  -Michael

      Yesterday was back to work as usual.  Not too many people are at the church on Mondays, so I usually am able to get a lot done.  That was the case yesterday as well.  I even got to visit with two of my teens.  Then we went to Summer Youth Series that night.  Summer Youth Series is a teenager praise and worship time that also includes a speaker on our theme or some form of Christian entertainment.  Our theme is "The Fellowship of the King".  It happens every Monday night and last night a drama ministry from Harding University "Theatron" kicked us off.  Next week I am speaking on the topic of "true fellowship".  Today is another busy day as I close out our trip from last week, meet with Blake and put three lessons together.  However, it is always a blessing to open God's word and explore it.  I am excited that we are in the middle of summer.  Praise God for His wonder and majesty.  Prayers Answered: I have told you in a previous blog that we as a church are praying for one of our families that are going through a certain trying time in their lives.  Yesterday, less than 24 hours from when all of our small groups prayed over them, their situation has improved and they have received good news and relief.  Praise God!  The power is not in the prayer, but in the Lord!  -Michael

      We went to Destin, FL for our senior trip.  This trip's destination is a secret to the outgoing and incoming seniors.  We use it as a fun trip, but also a spiritual marker for passing the torch of leadership.  We had a great time.  We spent two nights in Destin and the remaining two nights in Gulf Shores, AL.  The fun stuff: We hung out at the beach a lot We went on a dolphin cruise using Jet skis We went deep sea fishing in the gulf We saw a magic show And much more of our own fun and entertainment  The spiritual stuff: We had nightly devotionals We talked about leadership We worshipped together The last devotional on Thursday was awesome I gave my spill, being completely honest and not holding back The seniors responded by confronting themselves and each other They bonded like I have never seen a group bond before They are my new and improved senior class ready to take on the leadership of our entire group.  We got back on Friday evening.  I went to bed and got some much needed rest.  Leah and I hung out on Saturday and getting things done.  Yesterday was an emotionally exhausting day.  We have a member of our church who needs great amounts of prayer.  As a congregation we stood up together symbolizing our promise to pray for them through their current trial of life.  What an amazing testimony of how the body of Christ works together.  I would say that is true fellowship.  Today is a catch up day.  So, I am about to sit down, make my list of to-dos and get started.  I have been here two hours and so far have caught up on all my mail and happenings around here, while I was gone.  It's good to be back!  -Michael

      Last night we had another great Wednesday night of testimonies.  Two more of our senior guys talked to our group about what excites them about being a Christian.  They spoke well and kept a captive audience.  I was blessed by what they said.  We had a great worship time and had some humorous introductions.  Today the high school will go to "koinonia".  This is our event on Thursdays where we go to lunch together and hang out afterwards.  The title comes from the Greek word meaning, fellowship.  This is humorous to me now.  I coined this term for a Thursday lunch gathering when I was an intern in Waco.  I brought it here, the first year I was here.  And we have done it ever since.  However, recently (last Monday night) I have been talking on how fellowship is not just a gathering of people to eat together.  The idea of fellowship is doing all things to glorify God together.  We move as one body in our Christian walk, helping one another along the way.  However, the day is what it is and the name may not change, but hopefully around Houston our idea of fellowship is broadening.  Praise God, that we don't have to go at this all alone.  Having others in the battle, keeps us from giving up and being able to continue on.  We are the fellowship!  -Michael

       Service Project Week    We have had two intense days of service projects and the third is today.  Today is not so intense, but much needed.  We are serving the ministry that we partner with for benevolence, Interfaith Caring Ministries.  They are a blessing to our church, so we are sorting clothes for their resale shop today.  Which will work great, since the weather is very stormy.  On Monday all of the students came to the building not knowing what they would be doing for service.  The reason they didn't know is because no one did.  Once they got here we explained that in order for them to really think about service and make it there own we had an unusual project for them.  They had ten minutes to create their own service project and one hour to work it.  Then they were to come back and tell us about it.  We sent three groups of four out.  One group  went to a local home for special needs patients.  One of our youth group members is a resident there and they went to visit her.  Another group went to a nursing home and helped the nurses transport medicine from one place to another.  The third group went over to one of our members homes and helped her daughter with math and took her son to the playground.  It was great to see the groups plan, organize, and implement their own project without our help.  They did great on all of them.  Yesterday we went to a nursing home in Friendswood and put on a carnival.  We had different games for the residents to play.  They went to each booth and played the game and even got their picture taken.  Our students ran each booth and helped "Wheel" them around.  It was exciting to see the resident's faces light up and see joy in their heart.  Following our adventure there, we went to another members house, who recently has had some serious health issues.  We mowed, edged, weedeated,and weeded her lawn and flowerbeeds.  It is great to serve others and help them in the name of the Lord.  It's even better to get a group of teenagers excited about it and desire the service.  May we everyday find ways to serve the Lord and others, not out of duty, but out of love!  -Michael

       Fellowship of the King   Last night I spoke at our Summer Youth Series.  The theme this year is "Fellowship of the King".  Last night I spoke on true fellowship.  It was a little intimidating standing before 800 students and speaking.  Unlike adults at church who have weathered in their life the "boring" preacher.  These kids have extremely high expectations.  In order to get your point across, they have to track with you.  So, I did my thing and I think they were with me.  Needless to say though, I drove my wife crazy constantly asking her, "Did I do okay?, Did my message get across?"  The really cool part about speaking or leading worship before that many people, in that setting, is that there are so many of my friends out in crowd who have been praying over me.  The other really awesome thing is that God is completely behind me, as I share his message with so many.  But whether 800 or 8, God is glorified when we tell others about him.  My prayer is that He was glorified last night and that at least one heart walked away with his message.  On another note: We are in day 2 of our service projects.  Today is a retirement center.  We are doing an activities carnival for them.  This should be interesting.  I will tell you about it tomorrow!  -Michael

       Back To The Basics   I spoke to the youth group last night and offered this question.  If we took away all the camps, mission trips, retreats, and other events; who would we be as a ministry?  What would we look like?  How would we function?  How would others see us?  To be honest I am still pondering the answer.  I have only known youth ministry through the eyes of activity.  I have only known Christianity through the eyes of works.  And when I stop "doing" guilt invades and my faith seems less valuable.  I understand that works come out of faith.  I understand that activities come out of ministry.  However, if we as a group cannot discover who we are without activity, then we have only become the activity.  So last night we began to peel back the layers of who we are in order to find out what it is our ministry is really about?  Our ministry has a purpose statement, vision statements, goals, and scripture to guide us.  However, if we don't live by it or understand it, we are wasting our faith.  This week we are doing service projects for our local community.  Hopefully we can keep bring back the point of our verse (Isaiah 64:8) and our  urlLink purpose .  May God Be the Glory this Week!  -Michael

       Camp Memories   I walked the same path on Tuesday that I walked the day it came to me that I needed to be in ministry.  Nine years ago I was walking from Cabin 1 over to the pavilion where we eat.  As I crossed the road, I stopped.  I dawned on me at that moment that I was to be a minister.  Nine years later I am fulfilling the calling.  I went to "Senior Sing" (chorus) with the high school students.  This for me was very different that I had remembered it.  It seems as though we were much more serious and actually learned music, not just sang.  I went down to the river and remembered baptisms I had witnessed and the coolness of the water where we swam.  I recalled old camp talent shows with other youth ministers and staff as we ate a midnight snack in the kitchen.  Something we would have never been able to do as campers.  I spoke on Tuesday night in a new arts and crafts pavilion.  We worshipped together and I spoke about our spiritual gifts and the importance of not wasting them.  They seemed to stay with me and listen.  At first a total 30 minute devotional (I had 15-20 to speak) didn't seem worth the 4 and 1/2 hour drive.  However, being at the camp seeing my students, reliving my youth, remembering my call, and speaking the word to teenagers was more than worth it. I sometimes forget, that no matter how much time it takes, speaking the word of God is always worth it!  On another note: Tomorrow we leave for Vacation.  I will tell you all about it when we get back.  I just need time away and to relax.  I haven't had any real vacation since August last year.  I will be back blogging on July 5 (Monday).  Pray for me and Leah as we travel and for our much needed get away and rest.  Pray also that things go well here while I am gone.  -Michael

       Spiritual Gifts     Tomorrow I am traveling to Camp Bandina to speak at one of their sessions.  My friend Jeff Brooks is the director of the camp and one of the greatest youth ministers I know!  He has asked me to come and speak to the camp one night, since my junior high students are attending there.  I picked Tuesday night because it was the best travel plan for me.  Later I learned that Tuesday night was when they were talking about spiritual gifts.  Rather, Tuesday night is when I will speaking on spiritual gifts.  The text or scripture for the day is Acts 2:43.    Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.    They will also spend some time in Matthew 25 on the talents, 1 Corinthians 12 on spiritual gifts, and they will do a spiritual gift assessment.  I first want to thank Jeff for such an easy topic (this statement is dripping with sarcasm).  It won't be easy, but fulfilling.  I want to convey how we can find our gift, waste our gift, and glorify God with our gift.  Most of us don't know what our gifts are.  Some of us know our gifts, but waste them on things of the world.  Hopefully as Christians, we are embracing our gifts and using them to glorify God.  The scary thing about a spiritual gift assessment is that we find out what gifts we don't have.  And for me, for a long time, this became my best excuse as to why I shouldn't practice those gifts.  However, just as if you don't use the gifts you have you will lose them, so will we never gain a gift we don't practice.  Hopefully I can engage an audience that will embrace the gifts they have and not give up on the gifts they lack.  Hopefully God will use my gift of speaking to send His message.   Tomorrow and Wednesday I will not blog, Thursday I will tell you about the camp experience and then from Friday (6/25) through Saturday (7/3) I will be on vacation.  So after Thursday I will return to blogging on Monday, July 5.  -Michael

       Grace Uncovered  A Salvation Story from Mission Ganado 2002   Two summers ago while we were at Ganado we were able to witness an amazing conversion.  The preacher had went through the phone book of the town calling random names and talking with them and inviting them to the church.  Remember that this church is less than 20 members at the time.  Well, it just so happens that one of those that he called had broken the law previous to the call and soon to be sent to jail.  He was broken and sorry for his unlawful behavior.  While we were there, not just in the town but in the building, he came by to talk with the preacher again.  We were planning for the next day and had no idea what was about to come.  However, through the swinging doors from the foyer to the auditorium walked the preacher and a man and woman.  The man had talked with the preacher and discovered his great need for grace and forgiveness.  He discovered his need for Christ.  He was around 6'3", thin, and tan from years of work outside.  You could tell that the life he had had wore out his skin and had drained some life from his body.  His face was dull and lacked expression.  His mustache covered his lip and his eyes had lost any luster they once may have had.  He walked slowly and cautiously and shook a little when still.  The preacher announced this man's desire to give his life to Christ.  The baptistry was exactly clean and wasn't exactly full.  A baptistry in the midst of twenty saved people is not often used.  However, there was no stopping him from the grace he desired, there would be no more hesitations from the forgiveness and Christ that had found him.  He walked up the steps, I offered the baptismal gown.  He kept walking and went into the water.  No gown, fully clothed.  Again no desire for hesitations.  The preacher took his confession and baptized him in the shallow water.  The man fully drenched, with clothes sticking to him, did not immediately leave the pool.  He stood and with watery eyes gazed upon our youth who had begun to sing.  It was as if he never wanted to leave that place and for a moment became a sponge and soaked up as much Father, Son, Holy Spirit as he could.  He finally walked down the steps out to the auditorium and shared with us all his story and his new attitude of life.  Later that night he came to a cookout we were having and met the church.  Still later in the months to come he would have to leave, serve his sentence, and then be able to return.  No matter what happened those following days, He had uncovered grace in a small town, in an old Church of Christ, with only a few people.  Just proving all the more that grace is not anything we can do, but everything of what God can do and has done!  Live your life today to the fullness of the grace that is in Christ Jesus!  -Michael

       A Church's search for Desperate Freedom    I tried to blog yesterday, but some kind of error prevented me from ever writing.  Sorry about that!  We leave for our Junior High Mission trip this Saturday.  We call it "Mission Ganado."  Ganado is a small town west of Houston.  The population is around 1900 people.  The size of the church is around 20-25 people.  This will be our 5th year going there for a junior high mission trip.  The incoming 6-9 grades are participants, while the incoming 10-12 grades are leaders.  The first two years we did simple work projects on the building.  The third year to the present we have been running a Vacation Bible School for the church.  This church and town are special to me.  I was born in Ganado and though I grew up in Bay City, I visited this town often because of family.  Both my mom and dad's families live in Ganado.  So two sets of grandparents, three sets of uncles and aunts, my brother, dad and step-mom, and a slew of cousins live there.  I have family in town that I have no clue are family.   It is also special, because every summer I relive my roots, my past, and memories.  It is even more special because my students and volunteers understand me better by seeing these things as well.  However, the best part about returning to Ganado is realizing how the people of that church have grown.  There are so few people to work in the church that they cannot afford to turn down visitors or people who come through their doors.  Therefore they cannot hold onto their traditional preferences.  They must let go of what they want and totally surrender to God.  It is an awesome thing to see an 80 year old member realize that tradition doesn't out way the gospel of Christ.  That all are welcome and we must be the people to do so.  My prayer is that the churches I work for and love won't have to wait until their elderly age or the desperate need for community to discover this freeing truth.  Tomorrow I hope to tell you about one of the Salvation experiences that our entire youth group was able to witness in Ganado two years ago.  -Michael

       Back to Life, Back To Reality    Vacation in San Antonio was great!  It was great to relax, not worry over work and spend quality time with my wife.  Now, we get back to real life where other people exist.    We did the whole thing at San Antonio.  We went to the Alamo, Riverwalk, Fiesta Texas, Guenther House (Pioneer Flour Mill),Downtown, side trip to San Marcos, and read a book.  We ate a lot, slept a lot, and went real slow!    I feel very rested and ready to complete the summer.  Thankfully, I have some wonderful people here at home who can make it possible for me to leave and things not go undone.  Some of those people are:  Donna, Blake, David, Dan, Kenneth, Leah H., Bill, Toni, Dan M., Doug, Gary, Chris, Denise, Debbie, Pat, Laura, and many others.  Every minister must be a team player.  Every minister must be a part of the team, not merely it's leader.  I have a wonderful advisory team that is official (Youth Ministry Team).  However, I also have many wonderful parents and friends who are willing to step in and help out!    If you can leave and things run as if you never left, then you have a sign of a healthy ministry.  I am blessed to be here and minister to these families of Clear Lake.  -Michael

       Refreshing My One Word to Sum up Mission Ganado 2004    In our last team time, where we process the day, I asked every member of our mission team to sum up their week in one word.  As they thought how God blessed them during the week, they thought about compressing 4 days of God's glory into one word.  Not an easy task.  I heard words like, Amazing, Rewarding, Exciting, Unbelievable, and Wonderful.  My word for the week was refreshing.  On the first evening of our VBS I really challenged the students during our worship time.  The next day they really rose to the occasion.  The put in extra effort, love, and compassion.  It was refreshing to me to see a group of students, really go for God's glory and do some amazing ministry.  Physically I am anything but refreshed, but spiritually I am refreshed, renewed, and restored.  I am back in the office for today and then off again.  I will be back in on Monday.  My body is a little tired, so this blog will be kept short.  -Michael

        Painting Therapy     &nbsp;   Being lost in your thoughts and questions   &nbsp;  This past two weekends Leah and I painted our living room and Kitchen.&nbsp; It is our first permanent mark on our home.&nbsp; Also, it is the first time I have lived in a house that actually had color other than beige and white on the walls.&nbsp; I am not complaining, I love it.&nbsp; Now when I walk into the house I get a warm feeling that makes me comfortable.&nbsp; It will take a few weeks to confirm that it is the color giving me that feeling and not merely the fumes, but we will see.&nbsp; I have decided that painting as tedious as it can be, is extremely therapeutic.&nbsp; As I rolled paint onto walls for hours, I had no option but to listen to Leah's music and become lost in my own thoughts.&nbsp; My thoughts quickly turned into questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the questions really searched my heart.&nbsp; Here are some that I remember thinking:  &nbsp;  Is all this work really worth it?    Will we like these color choices for a long time?    Can life be more exciting that rolling paint for endless hours?    I thought this paint was "true one coat?"    Will I survive in ministry long term?    Am I giving my students all I have?    Does she really like this song?    Does God find molding and shaping us as tedious as this painting?    Will Maverick (our cat) survive the fumes?    Do I love enough?    Who is it that I need to show more grace towards?    Do you think she will see where I got gold on the white?    Do you think she will see the small smudge I just created trying to wipe it off?    Does God really love&nbsp;Leah more than I love Leah?    Does God really love me more than I love me?    Do I really need a dropcloth for every place I paint?    Will Leah notice the drop of paint on the carpet?&nbsp; (also an answer to the above question)    How I can I serve others more?    Can I cut it much longer in ministry?    Who can I sucker into helping me move my entertainment center, so I can paint behind it? (thanks Brock)    How can I be a better husband?    Will I be a good dad?    How many gallons will this take?&nbsp;   How is it that she looks gorgeous even with paint on her skin, old clothes and no make-up and I still look bad dressed up, well rested, and well groomed?   How do I make a straight line when painting?   What does God have in store for me next?    Well, this may be long, but these are the questions I ask myself.&nbsp; Some are asked not only when painting.&nbsp; What are some questions you ask yourself when left to your thoughts?  &nbsp;  -Michael  &nbsp;

       Routine  What Exactly is that?    I was on the phone with my dear mother last night, just catching her up on my life, harassing her in fun, and trying my hardest to make her laugh.  During our conversation I made the comment that I am ready for school to begin and get back to my routine.  However, I am not completely sure there is much of a routine in youth ministry.  Obviously some things are less crazy when the students are in school, but overall it is by nature a chaotic ministry.  My routine during school consists of much more office work.  I am usually getting two classes a week ready, sometimes a sermon, bible study, worship, retreats, communication with many people, working on  urlLink Soul Link , working on Summer Youth Series, elders meetings, and prayer and study.  During the summer I get about a third of those things done and the rest of my time is hanging out with students.  Both are great, but it is like two different jobs.  Growing up everything was about routine.  Routine really was bad for my personality.  I am generally a control freak.  A routine was just one way I was able to control my world.  Now that the nature of my job and life pushes me to break routine often, my control has decreased.  This is a great stress of life for me.  I usually feel that I do not have it all together.  The funny thing is that I hope this is true.  My constant control would not allow God to be spontaneous with me.  Therefore, I stunted my spiritual growth.  Now, I must trust in the Lord more and give my control to Him.  I am not cured.  I think for me to not be a control freak I would need a brain transplant.  That is just the way I am wired.  However,  God works through my control or lack thereof.  Ultimately He is in control.  Who is in control of you?  -Michael

       A Full Calendar    Today, I worked most of the day putting together our master calendar for our youth ministry.  I perused through several different school district calendars (and I still missed one), my school calendar, our ministry calendar, and church calendar.  I tried to put together the most comprehensive calendar for our ministry that I could.   One thing I quickly realized is how busy the students, ministry, church, and myself.  However, I would expect to find that in our over committed, time challenged society.  What was more engaging for me in this process was not how much time, but exactly how that time is being spent.  We spend our time in this ministry on some really great and Godly things.  We do Bible studies, classes, church, retreats, camps, mission trips, and much more.  These are all really great things to plan and participate in.  The question that haunts me is this:  Will the students in our youth ministries leave to go to college and think that they way to have church is to fill your calendar?  Will we continue to judge churches by what they do, rather than who they are?  The most attractive thing in our ministry should be that we are followers of Christ, filled with His grace.  The calendar is just a manifestation of that love for our Messiah and our boldness of faith.  The calendar isn't bad, the activities are actually wonderful.  Being busy for the Kingdom isn't evil.  We just need to continually evaluate what we do and why.  The grace of Jesus Christ gives us the energy to go to camp, retreats, mission trips, classes, and hang out together.  Thank God for giving us something to experience after we find His love, grace, mercy, and joy.  -Michael

       The Kadesh Experience    All last week I was on yet another journey and adventure with my youth group.  We took the week and went to camp Kadesh at ACU in Abilene.  The adventure was the pursuit of Grace.  We were involved in Bible study, worship, speakers, service projects, and prayer.  This week was a great compliment to our entire summer which has been devoted to the study of grace.  Kadesh has an intense schedule and gives little free time for the students, not to mention the adults.  It is a great camp and does so many things for the students.  However, the real work is the year long adventure at home.  We must take a crammed week and then invite our own students to work out their own salvation all year long.  The work of a youth minister is not one of glitz and glamour.  It is not fame and fortune.  It isn't even all fun and games.  The adventure of youth ministry is getting so deeply involved in sin that the only reason you make it through to the other side is the Holy Spirit.  As a youth minister you will deal with so many issues and problems with students while working out your own in the process.  This is a messy business, but because it is Kingdom business it is all worth it.  God Bless the men and women who work with students with the Light of Christ in their eyes.  -Michael
