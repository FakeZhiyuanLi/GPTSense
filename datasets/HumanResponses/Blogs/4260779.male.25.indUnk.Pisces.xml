						    urlLink    sscultpture  urlLink        i went to santa barbara about a month ago and came across this guy as i was leaving. he was really nice and let me take some pix of his sand sculptures, so i floated him some cash. he told me about how he was in vietnam and why he won't show his art in galleries. it was sad and and inspiring.

						    urlLink    ;)  urlLink      do you enjoy an active lifestyle? are you always "on the go"? do your teeth look like a mummy's cos you drink coffee "all day"? hi. my name is jason. i've tried several teeth whitening products, and the only one i endorse with my whole body is colgate "simply white". it's only ten bucks, and you can slather it on whenever you want without hassle. no crazy ass tapes or denture-like apliances, hoses, pulleys, cogs, servos or any simples machines. it's not too bad if you ask me.

						    urlLink    ...  urlLink      i have a lot of hobbies. my most recent hobby is animal pediatrics. i gave a water turtle an intraveneous injection today and it was awesome. it bit me 17 times. i have a video of the procedure, but there's a lot of profanity involved. it really hurts when they bite you.   while i was shooting this jerk up, i was considering learning taxidermy in case i messed up. i like to cover my bases. is it wrong that i make myself laugh  ? an ex- girlfriend said "yes"      i bet you guys think i dislike dan. he's alright. he has a really great body, he drives a monster truck and he throws a baseball like a girl, which amuses me immensely!       i just bought "goodfellas"- the new one, with the extra crap, and i just can't help but feeling that it's the most overrated movie ever next to fargo. "mean streets" is far better IMO.      NOUNS I MISS:      *wailing on my bass hard with sam.      *enjoying video games like i was 6      *rodney harrison    * vanessa kahner      *lucid dreaming( i haven't had one in months!)      *paxil      * chicken and waffles      * greatest dog    *lithium(every once in awhile. if you take it on a plane you'll feel like ants are eating yr intestines, which is semi-awesome!)      *people i love

						    urlLink    wanted  urlLink                                 if you see a datsun like this one, i will buy it!   the one i doodled is really this  color ,   which is    gross.   if you are interested in ninjas, robert hamburger's book, "real ultimate power: the official ninja book" will change your life. more later. it's too early for this crap.
