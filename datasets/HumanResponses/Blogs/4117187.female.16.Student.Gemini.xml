      I saw Jeff again Sunday. I had to work first, and I got out at 2, so I had to hurry home and I stuck my head out the window to dry my hair since it was still wet. I ran upstairs and changed and fixed my hair and makeup and such and then ran back downstairs to wait for him. Once he got there I dragged him right back thru the door so we could leave to go to the movies. We had to rush because he was supposed to come over at 2:35 and that's when the movie supposedly started, but there's always 20 minutes of previews, so we got there just when the movie was starting We went to see "A Little Black Book." It was a good movie from what I saw, except I really didn't see much of it because me and Jeff were making out the entire time. We actually had good luck considering there was a small row in the back of the theater with 4 seats and nobody was in those seats or anywhere near them. Sometime towards the end of the movie I was sitting on his lap but whatever. :P  After the movie we went back to my house. In the car ride hom he kept tickling me and blowing in my ear and my face and it was just hilarious because we were both being stupid. Anyway, when we got back to the house I was supposed to teach him how to dance, but my parents were always around and I didn't want to teach him how to dance and grind in front of my parents because it would be embarassing for him. We were on the computer and for a minute I was sitting on his lap because he put his arm around my waist and wouldn't let me go, and my parents freaked out. Then I was trying to share the seat with him and my parents freaked out about that. It ended up that I was sitting on the little crappy stool while he sat in the chair with his arm around me. I don't know what got into him, but he's starting to act like me! It's pretty funny actually. He was playing with my hair, and playing with my sleeves and sticking his fingers in my mouth and stuff.. yes, I bit him. :) He was being really sweet and romantic though in between and giving me nice soft sweet kisses and was holding me close every once in a while.. I really like that. A while later we had dinner with my parents and then went back to the computer a little while later and the his mom picked him up. :(   It was a really great day. Even better yet, I get to see him again this Friday! :) Yay! We're going to Chrissy's sweet sixteen party and I can't wait! I have to get her present still but I  will  get it before the party.  Anyway.. I'm done. Bye!

      Well the past few days definitely haven't been the greatest. As I said before, last Sunday when I went to Jeff's house, he gave me his webcam. Well, also he bought one too so we could see each other -- and I have to admit -- I was almost just as satisfied as if we were together in person.. almost. Anyway, my mom decided to throw fits because when she came in the room she could be seen, and never believed that just because I paused it or stopped it completely that she couldn't be seen or heard. Then this Sunday I was laying on my bed while I was talking to him on webcam because I was tired and he was just doing homework anyway (yes in the summer). My mom came in and didn't really put up a fight about it besides, "Don't his parents think it's weird you're in bed while you're talking to him?" I didn't really think much of it, but I guess I should have. Long story short, my parents both threw major fits and decided that they were going to take it out of my room the following day. Wonderful, isn't it? The one thing that was keeping me remotely happy while Jeff and I are apart was gone.  I spent the night crying and being pissed off because my parents were just being complete assholes the rest of the night. Thank God I have my  perfect  boyfriend to cheer me up when I need it the most. I mean, as silly as it is given the fact that we're both 16 and have been together for a little over a week more than 4 months, but we're planning on getting married. With that fact in mind, Saturday night when I didn't think it was possible for me to go from that mad and upset to as happy as I've ever been, Jeff managed to find a way. He decided my last name was now Caldwell. He kept calling me "Kelsey Alexandria Caldwell," and "Mrs. Caldwell." I was so happy. Not only did he change the last name, he changed the middle name too because he knows I would rather have my middle name as "Alexandria" than "Alexandra" because it sounds girlier. I've never been happier and I woke up still absolutely happy the next day. Eventually my parents said that I could occasionally use the webcam on the downstairs computer if nobody else wanted to use the computer at the time. I guess it's better than I had expected, but parents are stull assholes. I'd still rather have it in my room so I could use it every night instead of just every once in a while.  Another thing that goes to show you just how much he really does love me-- he didn't see me last weekend and he wants to see me this weekend. Wow, big deal right? Well, the only day next weekend I could possibly do anything if my parents will let me is Sunday-- the same day Devin wanted Jeff to go to Dorney Park with him. He decided in a second flat that I was more important than Dorney Park and he'd rather see me. I feel bad about him not going to Dorney Park, especially since it's not likely that my parents are going to let me see him, but I can't help but think it's adorable he'd rather see me.  I noticed I kind of do talk mostly about Jeff in here, but lately that's pretty much the only thing that's been going on that I really feel like talking about. I have my other journal that I write in --  urlLink www.greatestjournal.com/~lucky13880  -- but I have that up for everyone to see and I can't write really personal things about us in there or about my parents or friends that I just need to vent and I don't want anyone to see it. I guess this is more my  diary  instead of just another journal. I guess I'll just come with private stuff and save more general stuff for my journal.  Well that I think is the end of my entry for the time being. I'll be back, I promise. In the mean time check out my other journal if you actually read this. Also, if you read anything in here please comment so I know if I should bother writing on paper or something instead. Bye!

      Well, this is my first entry. First off, I would like to say MY FEET ARE FREEZING. Since that is said, I will explain what I have this blog for. I already have a journal on  urlLink http://www.greatestjournal.com/ , but I decided that since everyone reads one, I need one for just me. I need something private that nobody else reads. I know that nobody I know uses  urlLink http://www.blogger.com/ , or at least I don't think I do. If they do they have the same idea as me.  Anyway, I guess I'll start with yesterday. Yesterday I went to the movies with Jeff and then went over to his house. My mom really didn't want me to go, but my mom wasn't home so it was really up to my dad anyway. Around 2, Jeff picked me up, and surprisingly he was the one that was actually driving! He only has his permit, but his dad was in the car so it was alright for him to pick me up. Anyway, he drove out to the Phillipsburg movie theaters and we went and saw "The Village" at 2:15. It wasn't the best movie in the world, but that's okay because I didn't see the entire thing anyway. Moving on.. After the movie Jeff and I waited in the lobby for his dad since he went to see "Bourne Supremacy." Once his dad's movie let out, we left and Jeff drove us back to his house.  Jeff and I ended up at the computer as always making out and messing around. There's nothing new there. We were watching launch and a slow song came on so I made him slow dance with me again. I love dancing with him. I still need to teach him how to fast dance, but slow dancing is a start at least.  Later we ate dinner with his parents and his grandma-- chicken, rice, and string beans and carrots. Once his mom said that we could go, we went back in the computer room and were just making out again. Yes, we do a lot of that but what do you expect when we see each other once a week. We catch up on the talking part every night so when we see each other, we'd rather catch up on the physical part of our relationship.  Around 8 his dad drove me home, which I didn't really want to happen but I really had no choice. Jeff had given me his webcam before we left so that we could see each other every day when my mom won't let us get together. He's going to buy another one so I can see him too. Wee! He's glad he gave me the webcam because he can see when I'm smiling and laughing.. which is all the time, but you get the point. :)  Today was pretty much just me messing around with the webcam and sitting at the computer telling people that I didn't want to let them view my webcam. It's amazing how many bastards are out there that just want to see your webcam hoping that you'll do something sexual for them or that you're wearing provacative clothes. The only reason I have that messenger is because the webcam doesn't work on AOL instant messenger.  Anyway, there's not too much else for me to talk about, and I better try and see what's wrong with Yahoo messenger and the webcam because it says it's not connected. Jeff should be getting home soon and I know him -- he's going to want to see me as soon as he gets home.  I'll be back next time I need to vent or talk about something personal. I don't know when that will be but I'm glad I have something here that nobody else is going to read. Bye!
