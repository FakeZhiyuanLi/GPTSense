      This is the address for  urlLink my guestbook .  I'm not using it anymore. So how in the world did people get in to sign the book?  No paper tomorrow, but I've got Chinese O Levels Oral. Owell.  I found this blog. Nothing really escapes my eyes afterall. Hahaha! Okay, that sounded so haughty.  Anyway, I was contemplating whether to lock my blog or not, I went to try google.com and yahoo.com today. Typed "Winnie Leong" and my blog came out to be the first on the list. Woah.  I feel so voyeuristic.. not knowing who reads more blog. Owell, I've got nothing to hide anyway. This is getting boring.  -edited post/ truncated-

      Chemistry p2 today was a little easier than expected. Just a little. First time taking a major combined science exam, i guess it was pretty easy la, as compared to pure. I've not regretted dropping to sub sci man! Owell, like i have a choice. Hahaha!  There's the dreaded EMaths and Geography p2 tomorrow. I'm gonna do well for my EMaths. =D Failing maths is not my innate ability.   "I know i can, be what i wanna be, if i work hard at i, i'll be what i wanna be.."  Hahaha! Uh. Don't really like this song, but yea, it's appropriate here.  I realised i need to do well in a subject to like the subject, so i guess if i get 60 and above [which is bloody good considering my standards] for my EMaths, i'll be flying fucking over the moon man! HAHAH! I can't wait.  As for geography, it just comes to you when you write ya? [for human geog at least]  Anyway,  urlLink Horny  wants me to link her. And this is the best i can do until i get a new blogskin, which would be century egg years later coz i love this skin with a "heavenly-touch". Haha! Okay. Here's a quote worthy quote from Peychee which kept me laughing all night.  "Even though I got horny face, but i'm not horny one!"

      My mind has been wading thoughts filled with these two words recently, - Bicultural Singaporeans.  Eh am I anot huh? I know who is Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Tripikana, Ne Zha and I've been to China! I've watched before "Madam White Snake", "A Chinese Ghost Story", "Returns of a Condor Heroes" etc. Even though I don't know much about Mao ZeDong, Qing Shi Huang, Wu ZeTian, Deng Xiao Ping etc. But so? They Are DEAD! DEAD DEAD DEAD! HAHAHAHA! Okay, i'm being an idiot here.  Anyway, I  used  to want to work in China. I'm serious! China is SO big, the population is SO big, if every citizen in China buys something which i market [say it cost S$1, i'll be a billionaire already! HAHAHA!] But i realised that.. maybe not lah huh. My mandarin is not up to standard. It's simply mediocre. There's so many people in Singapore taking higher chinese, what am i compared to them?  And I don't agree with Lee Kuan Yew that only a handful of Singaporeans aka the "elites" can master two languages and become bilingual. Not many would agree with me, as in disagreeing with LKY. Afterall, he is THE MAN. While i'm not even THE WOMAN. HAHAH! Okay WTF.  I think it is this thing called  Interest  that spurts people to go the extra mile to learn a language. And it's already 4.23! OMFG.   to be continued..   or maybe not.  All the best to those taking their MYES.

      The mid year's over! Who should we be taking our "mid years". It doesn't make sense! We should not live in the past! Hahaha! Okay. I'm just finding some reasons for my procrastination.  I've not started my Chemistry revision AT ALL. And i'm not proud of it. Shit. I just need to remind myself. It doesn't seem to work.  Okay, anyway, i've figured out that the day I stop blogging would be the day that I truly am not "addicted" to blogging. Ya?

Heh.  I slept at 4am yesterday night/ this morning  again .  Okay i replied to your comment.  Resisting blogging i-am. =]

      And i've found my reason to live. Really. The things that you've been looking for is in fact, right in front of you. And you've always had possession of it, just that you took it for granted, although you know that you're not supposed to take anything for granted.  I did a lot of thinking this whole holiday. About life in general. Hah. "I'm only 15 going 16!" you say. But I say, "I'm already 15 going 16!" and i've not carved out a plan for my future. I  need  to know whether what i've been doing is essential, yet at the same time, I just want to live like an average 16 years old. My studying now, is simply an investment for the future. To secure my place in the irritatingly competitive world. You see, I abhor the competition. Humans should not live in this way. I always dream about settling down in some rural mountaineous area in New Zealand or something, perhaps rear a few cows and eat cheese everyday. Hahaha! Ok damn it. It's just a dream anyway.. Wake Up Winnie! But, this is how the world works, so why go against it? I say, I'll just go with "the way the world works" and be  even  better than "the way the world works". Not to prove to anybody or anyone [ok sama. hahah!], but to be better than what i've been achieving all these while.  In fact, i've realised how much I love to study. Really. I'm not buying the idea so that I can study. But yea, I like the sense of satisfaction. =] I feel so unbelievably aghast by the way I am typing this. Hahaha!  I wonder how some promiscuous people are gonna live for the rest of their lives. Won't they have a "ying yin" or something? Ok, i digressed.  I just love me. WOO! =D I'm not exactly different now i guess. I'm still me.  I've decided to not come online except on perhaps Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays? This would be a gradual change. Everything takes time anyway.  For a start, I should start sleeping earlier and waking up earlier. AHHH!

      I've just found it. It's soothing, very soothing. Very very soothing indeed. I love it. I love love love it! I just realised, the next best thing to oldies [for music] is very very soothing music!  - Time to Say Goodbye - Only Time - You Raise Me Up etc.  and Jamie Cullum is FANTASTIC!  Enough about music. I love the fact that i'm not addicted to blogging anymore! See! 3 days without a single entry! YaY! =D

      I've not been blogging for days, so please excuse me. Haha! Anyway, why are all my punctuations sticking together with my words? It looks like one whole chunk of tar! Ahh.  Ok, back to the topic. I  love  bitch blogs! Haha! Well, but bitching about general stuff that is, not about someone specific, dissing etc. [which I am guilty of actually, but I've learnt how to forgive. =]  "Forgiveness is like fragrance the violet sheds, on the heel that had crushed it." One of my favorite quotes by one of my favorite authors - Mark Twain.  Top 3 Bitch Blogs 1.  urlLink Maddox  [bastard, in this case] 2.  urlLink Xiaxue  3.  urlLink Stephanie Yong !  .. and steph yong's new bitch blog is my new found love! Haha! I love it! Here's a bit of her. Haha!  "And isn't it annoying when you're asking someone a question, and he or she takes a century to answer? I have a friend who took 4 hours to reply me and when I asked her what she was doing, she said:  "Oh I was taking a nap. I also closed the chat window by accident. Repeat the question please?"  OMFG GO TO HELL PLEASE."

      It's got nothing to do with me, really. My knowledge of soccer is just like the ball. Zero. Haha!  Owell, but I like the atmosphere. I'm here blogging now all thanks to my neighbours, going "YAY!", "OLE~~" etc. It's funny how because of them I can't get to sleep, yet ironically, I love them. Haha!  Anyway, reading "Tuesdays with Morrie" for the second time is truly insightful. But twice for now is enough. I should be reading my Lit Text! Which I have not yet even finished once! Urgh.  Gotta go buy Weiyan's present tomorrow and to go shopping with my sister! I need S11.

      What's with the stop blogging? Here I am again, typing my thoughts out. I guess I just love to blog, I can't help it. Haha! Well, but i love this new blog of mine! The solace and solitude it seems to portray. If you get to read my blog, you're the lucky few i told i guess. Do leave comments if you chanced upon my site, which is quite unlikely, and yea, like you would bother.

      I looked up, tears blurring my vision. I could not even see the last of him. The one who had fed me, groomed me, cuddled me and picked me up when I was in dire states, was now turning his back on me, like the world did. I had been an orphan since I was born. I witnessed my mother’s cold-blooded murder, a motorcyclist who did not even stop his bike when my mother was jammed onto his wheel. Instead, he parked his bike on the road shoulder, tossed my mother aside and inspected his bloodstained sports wheel. “Damn it!” I heard him shout. I saw the fury in his bloodshot eyes, like that of my mother’s on his sports wheel. I abhorred humans from that day onwards, and decided to make unrest for them by purring loudly in the wee hours of the morning. Insomnia was peanuts in comparison to the pain humans had caused upon fellow felines. I led a nomadic lifestyle from then onwards, which caused me to be involved in lots of sparring as I was always invading territories. Other strays were always picking on me, as they were green with jealousy that I was different from them. I was a rare Singapura cat. On one of my usual territory invasion battles, Zhi Sheng chanced upon me and came to my rescue as he saw that my paws were scratched bare with flesh hanging loose and blood oozing out from the freshly inflicted wound. "He had been dirty, hungry and completely without hope. Now there was a chance of a new life.” I thought to myself. He took me home and named me Tian Ci, which meant “heaven sent”. Zhi Sheng saw to my wounds and was very patient as he showered me with tender loving care. My hatred toward humans was being scraped away everyday bit by bit. However, behind every benevolent man was an unscrupulous wife. Mei Xin was extremely detestable. “Zhi Sheng, get this flea infested furry creature out of my house I beg you!” screamed Mei Xin in displeasure as she raised her hand in irritation and disapproval. She added that according to Old English mythology, I was a witch’s right hand man. What atrocity! She must have watched too much “Sabrina – The Teenage Witch”. Zhi Sheng defended me by exclaiming that I was a prized gem, according to Egyptian mythology. Three months later, Mei Xin and Zhi Sheng were expecting their first child. She was over the moon. She knew at last that it was time for me to go. “Dear, this cat’s feces might contain toxoplasma which can lead to miscarriage. I know it is heart wrenching to see it go. But when it’s time for it to go, it’s time for it to go.” Cried Mei Xin with artificial melancholy. At that moment, I wanted to pounce on her and slit her evil lips into shreds. Zhi Sheng protested and defended me. A decision was reached at last that I was not to be sent to the SPCA [Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]. Elation filled me and how I yearn to stand up on my hind legs and dance about in triumphant like the way Zhi Sheng danced salsa. "We shall leave him at the void deck. The SPCA would put him to sleep if he is not being adopted within a week.” Uttered Zhi Sheng. Mei Xin nodded in agreement as she claimed that she did not want the SPCA to put me to sleep. However, I could see from her gleaming eyes that all she wanted was to save some petrol.As I lay, stuck in this one metre by one metre box, the world seemed miniscule, like the hearts of self-centered homosapiens. There was melancholy in the wind and sorrow in the grass as I wait to see what fate has planned next for me.

      I was bored and i decided to go find mou mou ren's blog, it's really easy to find things with google&nbsp;I guess. hahah.. TO MY AMAZEMENT, sooooo many smssers got there before me. HAHA! AND yet to my amazement again, all this is boring me to the bones already. I no longer found the whole episode funny. Instead, I felt that my lost of interest seemed funnier.  Went shopping with my sister yesterday, got a top from Zara and a skirt from M]phosis.  I guess many things are changing, though I'm still trying to adapt to the no-computer lifestyle which as you can see, ain't really working too well. Owell.  I haven't been reading  urlLink quotes  for a long time. Used to read it daily.   Forgiveness is the healing of wounds caused by another. You choose to let go of a past wrong and no longer be hurt by it. Forgiveness is a strong move to make, like turning your shoulders sideways to walk quickly on a crowded sidewalk. It's your move.   What words of wisdom.

      Mr. Francis Lee had been a bus driver for bus number 186 in the St Michael's Bus Interchange for almost around a decade. He enjoyed working around the vicinity as he claimed that the people here were friendly and amiable. Everyone around the neighborhood called him Fran or Fran Lee [abbreviation for Francis], as he felt that such a calling sounded closer to the heart. Initially, Fran was a diffident young man in his thirties who did not know the nitty-gritty of basic public relations, as becoming a bus driver was a whole new experience for Fran. He had never worked outside an office before he was retrenched during the Economic Crisis. Three years from then, he had grown to become a mature and confident young gentleman, who held himself in great poise. Everyone in the neighborhood held him in high regard. However, he still keeps the reserved pearly white grin. Thus, fooling the new kids on the block to think that they can climb over his head. However, the old residents like myself know better. Then, the unfortunate thing happened. An old lady filed a complaint against him as she claimed that he allegedly closed the bus doors on her, landing her in the hospital for orthopedic treatments. All the residents were taken aback by such alarming news. No one expected him to close the doors on a weak and helpless old lady. Tongues wagged. Fran Lee’s renowned reputation was ruined. It was heart wrenching for the residents to see someone whom had been held in such high regard fall into dire states. Fran Lee was terminated from all bus related services with immediate effect.  Then came the new bus driver. Everyone was excited to see who the new driver may be. His name was Mr. Tyron Hong, with the pseudonym, Tyrant Hong. From his name itself, we can already see his popularity in the neighborhood. He was a road hog who tail gates, obstruct other vehicles on the road, and “Hongs”, as his name suggest, as he pleases. Everyone in the neighborhood abhors his driving manners and character. Mr. Hong was a stuck up driver who hated children. He thinks that they are like rattlers, chattering incessantly and unnecessarily. “Hurry up! Move in! Quickly!” bellowed Mr. Hong impatiently. That was he norm of an everyday ride to school. God knows where Mr. Hong is rushing to. There was once, when a primary school student had forgotten to tap his EZ-Link card when he boarded the bus. Instead of reminding the primary school kid, Mr. Hong switched off the engine and sat silently still, eyes crossed beneath his chest, eyes closed. There was dead silence on the bus. No one knew what went wrong. Suddenly, he pushed open the panel obstructing his way, came out from his driver’s seat and walked towards where the boy was sitting and shouted out loudly, pointing his index finger at the boy’s forehead, “Hey boy! If you’ve got no money, don’t take my bus!” Everyone was flabbergasted by the callousness a man can expel onto a boy of such tender age. He immediately apologized, stood up and went to tap his card. Being the person I was, who believed strongly in equality, I stood up and went to Mr. Hong and let out a sudden outburst of anger exclaiming that he should have put it nicely to the boy. I knew I had offended a beastly creature. The next day, when he saw me running after the bus, he quickly asked his passengers to board the bus and closed the doors right in front of my face. He turned to me, gave me a smirk look and mouthed “Bye Be” and drove off. I was fuming, and a storm was brewing within me. The following day, I decided to go earlier than usual so that there’s no way he can drive away without me. Bus 186 came, and I boarded the bus, feeling a spurt of triumph. I tapped my card and shouted a “Yes!” to him. He replied me with a malicious grin and accelerated, leaving me to fight for balance. He knew he had won again. A few weeks later, he was fired as many publics lodged complaints regarding his hot-temperedness and verbal uncouthness. Indeed, the grass is not always greener on the other side.

      I saw a flasher today, and his thang. Apparently, I got a shock, so I asked Liying to look, which prompted Peychee to look. Shavon looked, but failed to see. But this is something worth failing. YUCK.  I can't believe I saw a flasher. It's damn sick, and such indecent exposure should be condemned! This is the first time I saw a penis[and the balls] in my life, after my dinner somemore. I almost puked. It's THAT sick.  Man. And we were discussing why people would actually put that into their mouths, it's outrageously INSANE. it's GROSS. HAHAH! According to Shavon, she says that a penis is a gross thing because it's pertruding out of the body, whereas a cunt ain't that bad. But I guess if I see a woman sitting in front of me, flashing her cunt at me, I'll be shocked as well, and perhaps burst out in a fit of laughter. HAHAHAH! But the dick is one scary thing. I swear I'm not gonna eat Taiwan sausages for a few days. YUCCCCCCCCCCCK.  Back to some cleaner news.  Had speech day today which was fantastic. The seniors did really well and i wanna be just like that. Heh. I wanted to share something but it simply slipped out of my mind. Urgh.  Owell, shopping day tomorrow with my sis, but i've got nothing much in mind. Have not received my report book yet, although I did really badly, so atrocious that I feel like it's so "throw-face" for my parents to see, but i want to get it. Hmm.  OH OH OK I REMEMBER. In Lit today, we watched Pride and Prejudice, it's FANTASTIC. I shall go read the book later. Bought it a year ago but I've not read it yet. Hah. I love Lit these days. I love it when they flash shows for us to watch. =] I love to Kill a Mocking Bird. I love Pride and Prejudice. I love me. =D  Bye bye. Study hard kids!

      I've not been blogging for  days.    &nbsp;  This is good.    &nbsp;  Despite the coloration and all, it's not a factor big enough to draw me back to blogging. Haha!    &nbsp;  Owell, but I'm still coming online everyday! Though I try not to go onto MSN as often, or to appear offline, so that I'll go offline faster as well lah. Hmm.   Today has not been a conducive day. I've got bio prac test tomorrow as well. And, I think my Maths did improve. Heh heh. By leaps and bounds? Not exactly, just a little better. Okay, I shall stop answering my own questions. That's the problem with blogging, no one to answer questions you post but yourself.   SIX MORE WEEKS TO PRELIMS.    &nbsp;  I'm not prepared! And at the rate i'm going, I seriously do not know where I'm heading.  To think I still can watch TV more than an hour per day and to be onine for more than an hour per day.  I'll be getting back my results tomorrow, which also marks the start of my NO TV/NET law EXCEPT on saturday AND on tuesdays to watch Singapore Brainiest. HAHA! So many concessions, but owell, we're humans too anyway.  And yesterday was lousy as well, i slept really early, or rather, fell asleep while attempting to read "To Kill a Mocking Bird".  It is a sin to kill a mocking bird, for a mocking bird does nothing but to sing for you. Oooh, I'm gonna try my best to read, digest, ingest and what-not it. But not egest. Okay lame.  Time is running out when I think about TIME generally. But why don't I think about it when I'm online or watching tv? TMD.  It's getting  HARDER  and  HARDER  to breathe!

       THIS IS GOOD.   I love big fonts anyway. Haha.  I guess my maths is improving, bit by bit.  No wonder some people can be so good in maths. There's no strategy, no better way you can go about doing maths other than  practising and practising and practising.    &nbsp; It's not like English, where you gotta read, enhance your vocab, get your grammar right and all that stuff. I'm starting to like Maths you know. Even though I'm still not up-to-standard for a good grade.. Now all I need is the determination. Hardwork pays. &nbsp;  I love the coloration. Blogger is getting better and better.  &nbsp; I like how the 5 of us are now. Peychee, Liying, Shavon, Veron and I. And I like how we love each other, help each other and care for each other. The magnitude of a true friendship outweighs the test of time and predicaments. &nbsp; Sunshine fill my window, that's what you are.. My  shining star* &nbsp;=]

      I'm feeling really awful coz I guess I might not even be able to get a B3 for my MT. And I kinda dread the idea of retaking it. I may get a B4. I may get a B3. Whatever it is, I WILL not be glad. Just give me an A2 I BEG. I'm feeling terrible after lao shi went through the answers today. I'm still in a state of shock that i got 2/10 for my Li Jie Wen Da.  Damn.  I know complaining won't help, but it has been on my mind 24/7, no matter how I try to forget. It Just Keeps Coming Back. I can't wait for August. I can't wait to get my results back. Even if it's bad news. At least let me SEE it.  Anyway, MYE results have not been satisfying so far. Owell. I've been quite satisfied with school recently. I kinda enjoy it a lot more. Hmm.

      Many Singaporeans are not willing to take the risk of setting up their own businesses, as they are afraid of failures. Setbacks scar the hearts of young and budding entrepreneurs. However, daredevils Jun Jie and Yong Quan were fresh graduates stepping into the competitive world of business, they wanted to have a share of the large pie. They got down to the nitty-gritty of the problem – financial aid, and got a loan from an overseas bank. They started a Trusty Fund where both of them pooled their money together for further investment plans.  Within six months, the business boomed and company revenue increased exponentially. Their careers took off successfully simply because they strived for excellence and were cooperative. In addition, they were also the best of friends. However, everything that goes up got to come down one day.  Yong Quan was a habitual gambler and had lost a hefty sum of money in shares recently. He resorted to embezzling company funds. This resulted in lesser Trusty Fund for further investments and work efficiency dropped drastically.  As for Jun Jie, he was a debonair who was loved by many women. However, of all women, he chose to have an affair with his best friend’s girlfriend, Mei Ling. They betrayed each other’s trust.  For their own selfish gains, they crushed a friendship built ironically, on trust.  Jun Jie kept running away from Yong Quan and vice versa. They were avoiding each other as both best friends were being pricked by their guilty conscience. They did not want to lie to each other, yet inevitably, they felt that they “had” to.  Two months later, their business crumbled. It was like a miscarriage, eight months of nurturing, so close to “birth”, yet they had crushed what they both had built by hand. They had to keep on running. They had to run away from debt collectors, run away from investors and run away from the broken pride of a failed business. They had to run away from the dissing relatives, run away from each other and run away from reality.  Yong Quan had a rocky relationship with Mei Ling and he decided to reconcile with Jun Jie as he felt that friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love. Or is it?  He went over to Jun Jie’s house hoping to become friends again. Yet to his amazement, the girl whom he once dreamed of as his wife was lying in his best friend’s arms. He could not believe the cruelty of such infidelity and betrayal. “Yong Quan! Believe me, He was just helping me to fix the light bulb.” Mei Ling cried out defensively. Yong Quan was flabbergasted. He could not believe the lies sprouting from his lover’s lips he once kissed.  From then on, there was a truce between them. They gave each other the cold shoulder. They did not cry from the cold without, they cried from the cold within.

      And then the line went meekly straight, No more punctuations of peaks and troughs; The final cut between life and death. I blinked past the wetness of white and lights, Some sat down, some slumped against walls, Choking as all spirit fled us, Unable to stand and muster a farewell to This gentle soul into the night. And then the line went meekly straight, I looked upon he who laid ashen, Still as the gripping cold of the room. Behind him the machines wept and breathed, Into veins curdled, Into lungs drowned. The sickle had reaped This gentle soul into the night. And then the line went meekly straight, As it should have some time ago, If not for comrades that have kept the semblance Of a living heart, with tired arms and bent backs. We have seen more deaths than we care to know. But, we men and women, now pained to the pith, Will always remember the passing of This gentle soul into the night.

      MYEs are over [!!] Nothing much to be excited about really. I rather have exams on every other day. Then we'll be able to go home earlier. =]  Contemplating blog closure as usual. I'm leaving broken links everywhere! Hahaha! So bad.

      Tomorrow shall be and will be the last day of my MYEs. Not feeling too much of anything, school hours will resume to long and dreaded hours. Urgh.  This MYEs is taking wayyy tooo long. My study-mood has long been gone! AHHH. Geog/ EM tomorrow. I guess it's probably because the last time I took my MYEs was in 2002?  Anyway, I was late today, which was "odd", considering the fact that I've been going to school on time early for egg-years. WHY? Coz my dad went to Thailand, thus no transport = must take bus. HAHAH! Damn it la.  Agne's coming back on Saturday. And thanks to Agnes, Erin and Merser for being the first few people who wished me a Happy Birthday in advance. It's not in June. It's on the 27th of JULY! HAHAH! Weird.   Fumbling his confidence  And wondering why the world has passed him by  Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments  And failed attempts to fly, fly

      Sometimes, I really wanna start life anew. Be born again, start school, start life, start everything anew, but no. It's impossible. But it won't harm to wish yea? Anyway wishes  never  do come true, that's why there's this thing called - Wishful thinking.  I was "reminiscing" my past mistakes, i'm quite shocked at how blind I was to see that what I did was terribly terrible. I  was  truly blinded by my own fault. Blinkered vision or whatever you say. I used to feel that denying is a good way to forget things you do not want to remember. Man. I cannot be anymore wrong[er] than that. I love Morrie. [nb:  tuesdays with Morrie ] In the book, it was said, "Accept the past as past, without denying it or discarding it." I follow lots of his rules to live ya know? That's why I truly encourage people around me to read it. It's fantabulous. =]  Few of my favorites,  "Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others. Ask for forgiveness from others. Forgiveness can soften the heart, drain the bitterness, and dissolve the guilt."  "Accept your doubts about your ability to achieve any change in your emotional state. But keep trying. You might be surprised."  And.. I'll probably blog more later/ tomorrow.  //anyway, if you noticed, i've just re-formatted my layout. Why? Yes, you've got it. Damn blogger screwed up again. They love cutting away my bottoms. [of the layout] As for the links and such, i'll link them up  again  if Habibi wins the elections. Wait, he's dead isn't he? HAHAHHA. Okay, if Megawati wins the elections.

      Yet again, it was wayyyyy tougher than expected. It makes me seem like i'm underestimating the O Lvls exams. Hell no. It's just wayyyy tougher this year. Sucks.  I did the 2000,2001,2002,2003 practices and I scored 10,10,9,9 respectively. And this year, MY REAL THING? I reckon an 8/10. WTF. This is not good. Everyone's able to let LC pull their grades up, as for me, this is wayyyy below mediocre. It simply SUCKS. But it's done. So why am I even complaining? Ahh.  Complaining about a not well done examination is like complaining about the weather, you can't really do anything about it. Can you?  Anyway, I watched the Czech Rep and Greece match the day before my lit exam, which left me feeling really lethargic the next day. Hahah.. That was the first match I watched for the Euro2004. I supported Czech, and it lost. Urgh. Owell, football/ soccer is a waste of time. A few ants-sized man running around on a mousepad-sized field kicking a termite's head. Fun? You bet [yea literally].

      It's wayyyy tougher than I expected. The passage was a descriptive essay about Holland Village. Descriptives suck. But I managed to read all the words correctly [i hope].  My conversation questions were about drugs and criticism. If only it's about abuse or suicide. Owell. I wasn't prompted any questions for the first conversation [is it good?], and he didn't even allow me to say finish! Lan lan. Hahah. The second took a little longer.. Which is like I still wanna say the first one lor. I haven't even said a single  chen yu  yet! Haha.. In the end, I only used one, which was  guai wai mo jiao  aka beat about the bush.  The two examiners were so damn nice. Really. They are not as bad as I expected. Haha.. Male telling the female examiner, "Wow, what a bright smile!" [wah, hao can lan de xiao rong ah!] Anyway, the male examiner's mandarin was DAMN BLOODY seh! So cool! It sounds like those LC tapes we listened to.  Actually, I wasn't exactly smiling because I was happy or something, but because I was damn nervous la. Haha..  Both examiners were quite old. And lao shi told us that all the examiners that came today are YOUNG FEMALE TEACHERS. Liar! But I prefer male examiners really. They are more lenient to girls don't you think?  When I finished oral-ing [no pun intended], I wanted to JUMP! YES. Literally JUMP and SCREAM. Hahaha! It's this emotion simply inexplicable. Haha! I hope I'll be able to get a distinction man! Or a high merit at least! AHH!!  I'm still damn excited. Hahaha! Lit tomorrow. What a drag.

      “I’m going to make a change,” exclaimed Hui Cheng in affirmation. She had become a drug addict after being brutally struck by the Economic Crisis in 1997, and has yet to pick up the remnants of a failed business venture. Hui Cheng thought that she had fallen into unfathomable abysses of disgrace. She had lost to the fight against adversity.         After being caught in a raid at one of the discotheques in Mohammad Sultan Rd for possessing ketamine, she was juried to stay in The Singapore Drug Rehabilitation Centre for a year.         As a volunteer in the rehabilitation centre, I talked to her and shook her up from befuddlement. She promised to change her ways for the sake of her bedridden stepmother who was at the last phase of her life. Shortly after making such a life changing decision, she was released from the drug rehabilitation centre.         Hui Cheng found a job at a chain coffee shop [Killiney's Kopitiam] that gave former drug addicts a new ray of hope. She was employed at a diminutive pay in comparison to her previous occupation. I could see her unwillingness from the eyes that betrayed her. However, she knew that there was not much of a choice, as it would not be easy finding a job out there as she had a record.         “Good Morning Sir, you exude such radiance that would make the sun jealous! So would you like a cup of coffee with our world-renowned kaya toast?” suggested Hui Cheng in a chirpy voice. At one glance, we could see Hui Cheng’s ability to ingratiate the customers without overdoing it. She was indeed cut out to be a Public Relations Officer.         From the table where I was seated, I could see that Hui Cheng had truly turned over a new leaf. She had triumphed. She had gone through cold turkey and came out a stronger person.         However, two weeks later, the boss started to complain about her restlessness and zombie-like expressions. “She’ll always bring a plastic bag containing god-forbid-us-to-know around! If this continues, I’ll have to sack her,” commented the boss.         “Where’s Hui Cheng?” I asked in great dismay.         “Back alley fagging a cig I suppose,” cried the boss, shaking his receding hairline head.         As I ran towards the back alley, I saw Hui Cheng. Her fingers interlocked, with a plastic bag clasped in the middle, her head bent low as she inhaled a deep, slow breath from the plastic bag. She was squatting down on the floor with puddles of wet mud all over the place. She did not look human to me. It was a degrading sight. It was beast-like. It was obvious that she had never intended to keep her promise. Her turning over a new leaf was simply a façade. A fallacy.        My footsteps felt heavy as I dragged my feet away from such a sight. I could feel the depressing pressure with every step I took. I went back into the coffee shop, sat down and sipped my cup of coffee. As the backflow of tears slid through my throat, I could not taste the coffee but the tears within.

      The first step to turning your life around is getting rid of this negative belief that you can't do anything or that you're helpless. How can you do that? Often the reason that people say they can't do something is that they've tried things in the past that haven't worked. But remember - and I've used this phrase again and again throughout my life.   Your past does not equal your future.     What matters is not yesterday but what you do right now. So many people are trying to drive into the future using a rearview mirror to guide themselves! If you do that, you'll crash. Instead you must focus on what you can do today to make things better.  If you look at any of the most successful people in history, you will find this common thread: They would not be denied. They would not accept no. They would not allow anything to stop them from making their vision, their goal, a reality.   No problem is permanent.   urlLink   No problem affects my entire life.   urlLink   This, too, shall pass if I continue to take massive, positive, constructive action.   My message to you is simple, and in your heart you know it's true: Massive, consistent action with pure persistence and a sense of flexibility in pursuing your goals will ultimately give you what you want, but you must abandon any sense that there is no solution. You must focus immediately on the actions you can take today, even if they are small ones.

      You're going to change the world today. Now, don't try to deny it. And you know, I understand that it can be a little overwhelming, to have the entire world depending on you. But I know that you can do it. Actually, I knew you could do it when I first met you. When I first saw the hunger in your fingertips and the fire in your eyes. When you spoke in just that way, with just those words, in just that rhythm that said, "I'm going to change the world. Gonna make it a little better, a little sweeter, a bit more true." And I remember the way you said that nothing on this or any other planet was going to stop you. Then you turned and walked away, confident and clear. And I remember thinking to myself that you were amazing, that I'd never met anyone quite like you, and I was sure that, if you put your mind and hands to it, there was nothing that could break you. So there you sit, knowing that today's the day. Because I see the way you're shifting nervously in your chair, the way your body crackles and zaps, the way your grin says that you've decided that there is no time like now to move. You're going to change the world today. I'm just glad I was here to see it.
