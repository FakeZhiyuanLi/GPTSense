       okay, well people...hello again...lol after soo long im finally bak from my lovely vacation in NY and Boston. Well first of all i gotta say how much i missed home...damn...especially mai loverboi...damn...i tell u it was like torture...pure torture. I talked to him on the phone yea...but that just wasnt enough, well bum bum, jus gotta let ya know im sooo happy to be bak home and be able to be with u. *muahhhh* And yes u see that sexi guy in the pic below...uh huh....thats mai loverboi...thats right keep that in ur head. Nee way, on with my vacation story, it was fun u can say, but more like a life journey into my family life for me. You see, while i was dur i learned a lot about my family ex. my grandparents, aunt, uncle, etc...things that i had NO CLU about...n believe me...u dun wanna know...im traumatized enough. Well jus take it from me...it was tough. So here goes...      i arrived in NYC on Tues the 20th of July 2004. Mai aunt Fiona came to pik me up along with her husband Dwayne. wen i got dur, it was like 12:30pm dark streets of NY freak me out, and then they decided we need to go have dinner sumwer...*me..freaking out* dun giv me wrong, i was happy to go out with them...but at 12:30pm on the streets of NY..and we would have to walk a bit, this was NOT wat i was xactly wanting to do at that time...a bed sounded good enough to me. But any way...we went to eat, as we parked the van and started to walk to the restaurant, i can feel mai heart racing, i was indeed scared of such an environment. SO we got to the restaurant, i ordered mai food blablabla...ate...blablabla then wen we were goin home...mai uncle decided he had to make a drop off at the Bronx...yes thats right me n mai aunt was goin with him to the bronx...jus for a couple seconds, but still damn...he gets out...couple bags in his hand...me n mai aunt was parked in a prking lot, we're scurd cuz we dunno wen he comin bak, then all of a sudden, i swear i saw sumtin pass by, freaky, but mai uncle came bak, we're driving off, we saw his peeps. It was jus like i imagined...big, muscle dudes, all dressed in BLACK...*wonder wat they were doin* i try not to think about it...well as tormenting as that was, i was able to go to their house n try to sleep.     woke up the next day...bright and early...*yeah right* woken up by the sound of a screaming child and sum1 jumping on me. Who was it? hmm mai little bratty cousin *josh* and believe it, their wasnt one of him...ther were 2 of them, well not xactly the same person, but just as bratty. So after being woken up, i had to go make him a bottle...and ewww poopy...NOT the thing i wished on doing on vacation either...it was like explosive. I swear i almost passed out *air freshner* plz...PLZ...plz... and hurry...the stench of such a thing is high enough to wake the dead. sum1 needs to teach these little brats...damn...so started off my day with the smell of *explosive poopies*kind courtesy of mai cousin josh* so moving on to breafast...there was no way i was gonna make mai 8 yr old cousin, pancakes, eggs, tea, and sausage...yes i like *sausage* lol but NO i wasnt about to make it. so off to Mc Donalds we went...after gettin dur...she wanted pancakes, eggs etc...then after we ordered, she didnt want that anymore...by the time we were done, i had 3 different meals...not for me...but 3 so that she could chose 1. Then came josh...again...poopies...and yes he wanted more milk...* wer was the baby sitter* o right...she took the week off. GREAT...so to make it worse...here comes *shopping* the part that i look forward too, hah...yah right...i think u could guess....yes...the two brats were coming along. How were we getting their? uh huh...BUS...yay...me, a 2yr old...and an 8 yr old on a bus...to make it worse...they kep fighting...and the sun was hot...so im here tryin to shop...and take care of them? right...like that was gonna happen....so bfor i knew it...i was on my way bak home. Furious as can be, but yes i couldnt take another moment of it, home sounded good...lock them in a room to play, fight, kill...sounds good...once josh dun poop again, or they stop yelling...everything should be good right? WRONG...the AC broke down...so the house was hot....wer did this take us? TO the PARK...i think u've seen the huge scar on mai foot...yah...over the branch, n *scrape*yes...that was my leg. day of torture i say. so wat can be worse than this? lets see...    Went out with mai aunt n uncle...they were drunk...i was a place i wasnt suppose to be...dad called uncles cell...,mai uncle was 2 drunk n stupid so he told mai dad wer i was etc, *ouch*bam* within 5 mins i was on mai way home...yes...stuck with mai cousins again...josh woke up around 2am...screaming...his rents not dur...i had to wake up..try to fead him milk..put him bak to sleep...so much for that he was up until 5am...dad called...every1 was mad at every1...hmm within 24 hrs i was on my way to Boston...mayb things will get better.    Took the bus to Boston, to my aunt Debbie...uncle Lincoln, cousins Steffi and Kristin. Hmm so far so good...but wait...i got off the bus...they were no wer in sight, there i was standing by the pay phones waitin on them. Some wierdo perverted man around 40 yrs comes up to me..."hey beautiful...blablabla how old r u...damn...if u werent so young i'd ask for ur #, i seem to be interested in younger gurls" uhhh O...KKKKKK freaky....so after waitin for like 10 minz...i decided to walk around...o yay...i got torured by some old man jus cuz i didnt walk around...mai aunt, being smart was waiting in the parking lot across from the bus stop. so we went home by her...i ate...we talked...watched movies till like 5 in the morning...slept for like 3 hrs...woke up...    Now this was looking like a vacation...shopping at 9am..we were already on the go to the streets. Walked around bought a couple things, went to a restaurant that mai aunt likes...so, me not having an I.D. she decided to order 2 magaritas...hmmm *they'll neva kno* yea right...we got busted...got lectured...mai aunt got mad...wen we were leavin she didnt giv the chik nee tip lol...not 1cent more...lol ahahahah...thats wat she gets for messin with mai aunt and her alchohol...lol went on...we chilled...i mean i had the best time with mai aunt in Boston, and some peeps that i met, Alana, her boyfriend marcus and her brother Chris...yes hmm they were just about the sweetest people...we had some awesome times...     moving on...im getting tired of typing, but the *club* grind-in-dancing-jus chillin, it was great, dinner...movies...stayin up all night...it was great...n yes *BUM BUM IM SORRY ABOUT THE CLUB THING*U KNOW I DIDNT MEAN ANYTHING BY IT* sorry...hope u 4give me...     people...well i jus gotta let u in on some funni shyt that happen...hmm damn people in NY r freaky...why i say so?
