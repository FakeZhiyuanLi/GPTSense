      I sat around today realizing just how boring my life really was, so I decided to start a blog. I hope this works out for me. So yeah, dont get too excited, this is my first post. I am used to only writing in a journal that either only I read or my high school english teacher reads, so this is pretty new to me. I can see that I am gonna need work on this, maybe my next post will be better. Okay, that concludes my writting for today.

       Today I went to work cleaning busses for a buisness called the people mover. My Grandmother is the boss so I had her nagging at me telling me what to do how to do it and all that great stuff. It took three hours to clean one bus because today she had me do industrial cleaning. but in the end she took me out and bought me a big mac meal and brought me home. So now I am sitting at my computer, eating a bigmac and frys, drinking a doctor pepper and feelin' fine! (even if I am sore)

      Have you ever wondered if the internet really is a way for the government to spy on us? I mean, is it really just so that we could find out information? Or is it just so that they can know more about what we like or our interests, or what we do in our spare time? This is just something I have given five minutes of thought on, and I decided to post it to so if I can get any replies on what other people think that are out there in Internet land.. Maybe this is a form of government spying.. hmm, I think I am done now.

       Has anyone ever taken a few days to just lay around and be lazy for a while? I just got done doing that this weekend hence the fact that I didnt post. It was great, sometimes a lazyness treatment is the perfect antidote of stress. Wow, I was just listening to the news and I dont know who it was that was saying Gays and Lesbiens have so many rights, but then it says something like they dont have the right to change marriage or something.. You know, I'm not Gay or a Lesbien, but I still think they should have the right to get married. It's their choice to be who they are, and we as an america should support them. Thats the "American" way, is it not? I dont know, I'm very confused. My state just started allowing Gay marriage. I say right on! What do you think?

        &nbsp; Wow, this Blog thing got a bit updated, either that or I havent noticed this stuff...     &nbsp; &nbsp;    My friend e-mailed me this morning, and she was mad about something her mom did. As I read on I find out that her mom is now making her pay for rent. But she disguises it as having my friend pay her for taking care of her animals. Which would be fine if she would do it. The big thing is that her mother doesnt have a job, and wants every one else to pay her bills. She has never had a job as long as she moved. She has to be at least 50 now, and she still acts like a 2 year old on a regular bassis. My friend wants to move out but all the money she makes she has to give her mom. Is that stupid or not?       &nbsp;   &nbsp;
