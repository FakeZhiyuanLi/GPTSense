      Ever feel like you're in the Truman Show?  I have.  It always amazes me how things appear to you just at the right time, or soon enough after to make a difference.  Last night I was in one of my worst moods in a long time.  I wrote probably the darkest poem I've ever written.  I felt (physically and mentally) like crap.  Then today I pick up my book at lunch... it all changes.  It's a book about sales and it's been used for over 100 years at some of the top schools in the world.  Something every marketing person (and after being 1/2 way through... every person) should read in my opinion.  So anyway, it gives you tips on how to do things and the chapter I'm reading now says SMILE!.  That's it.  That's the tip.  SMILE.    The chapter encompasses all of these stories that exemplify why you should smile and the testimony of those who have tried it... yadda yadda. So during these stories I start thinking (as most intelligent people would) about when I smile, and how it makes people react to me.  Well the dominant scenario that flooded my mind was being in costume.  Whenever I smile during a game it seems to change the whole scope of the game.  Infact, the crowd picks up on all of my moods - but they also control my mood to an extent.  Really all it takes for me is to see one kids face light up as they look at me, or one adult laughing, and I remember what it's all about.  Yes that was very "afterschool special"ish, but I have to say it's true.  Without the crowd, my job would suck.  They make it worth it.... all because they SMILE.    Amazing how it comes back to bite you in the ass huh???  :-)

      At 26... cleaning your room still sucks.  Women marry for money and ego reasons (so they don't become an old maid), and some even marry for love (fancy that idea).  Men marry for (in this order...) love, sex, and so they don't have to clean their rooms anymore.  I hate being single - at least this part of it.

      Ok.. so this is my big kick.  I think I've already told you about the Jaycees event that's coming up.  The mixer and Meet the Candidates where I am aiming to educate at least some of our members on what is going on around them.  So in my efforts to educate myself, I decided to buy the Sunday edition of the Press of Atlantic City.  Seems a logical choice.  Survey the medium that is typically used to inform people who do participate in the democratic process.  WELL... apparently, nobody in Atlantic County needs to learn anything about what's going on because there were NO articles about local politics in this newspaper.  The big story on the front page was about flooding problems in a section of Atlantic City that is not currently, nor has it been recently, flooded. With campaigns on-going, and the national focus on politics, wouldn't it make sense that the news report on something like that.  Sure there was plenty of national coverage available (like Kerry and Bush spending nearly $330 Million by the end of June), but nothing local.  In my best estimation so far, we have 3 positions in county/state government open during this election.  2 of them are freeholders, 1 is a congress seat.  I don't know.. call me crazy.. that may be a little important.  They only actually effect the way we live.  I have to check on the Governor as well... not sure if he's due to get the boot yet.  Let you know soon enough.

      Just something to remember.  Less than 70 years ago today - in other words, during recent history - we (the U.S.) dropped one single bomb on a small island near Japan and literally instantly killed 140,000 people.  That scares me.  For some reason I think there is a lesson here.

      Ok, so the Jaycees (Junior Chamber) are doing a mixer in September with political undertones.  It is my job to start collecting basic information about politics on both the national and local levels in order for our members who know nothing (like me) to be able to decide if they are Dem or Rep.  So far I've come up with the VIP survey that the  urlLink WWE  put out. Don't laugh, it's actually pretty comprehensive and relatively unbiased.  I also have  urlLink JohnKerry.com  and  urlLink GeorgeBush.com .  I found an interesting article this morning as well in the  urlLink New York Times .  It was written by none other than Bruce Springsteen - think that'll get the kids thinking?  But I won't include it in the information pack as it is definetly partisan.  If anyone has any ideas of some other resources, please feel free to help us all learn about the process.

      Here it is... my first ever post to a blog.  Guess it's all down hill from here.  So now the idea is for me to sound off on basically everything, and you all get to read it, and comment on it.  Fun... sounds like ramblings from the edge to me.  Well.. feel free to make all the comments you want.  Talk to you soon.

      Here it is... what you've all been waiting for. A Sports Business blog. This is the place where I will post things I've seen in sports, or issues I'd like to yell about. Please feel free to make this your own little coffee room of ideas to give and take. Also, if you'd like to have anything posted and want to remain anonymous, email me at  urlLink junior9409@yahoo.com  and I'll be happy to post it for you.  And please, the more you share this location, the better it will be for all of us.  Thanks!  The Management (Brian)
