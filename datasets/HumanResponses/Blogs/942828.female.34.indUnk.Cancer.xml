       Tech note, and a thank you  I am very new to blogging, and any tech glitches that show up here are probably due that, or possibly to Blogger's own glitchiness. Please bear with me ! I would like to thank the wonderful Shawn McElhinney at Rerum Novarum. There's a link to his blog on the left. Without his tech expertise, I'd still be floundering about.  Li gala, mellon.   (That's 'many blessings, friend', to those who don't know Elvish...)

       Why Quenta Nârwenion ?     I've been using the name 'Nârwen' on several boards for a while now. It's Sindarin Elvish, meaning ...'rat-maiden.' ( I happen to be fond of domestic rats, though due to circumstances beyond my control, I have none at the moment, alas ! )  I figure that since the  Quenta Silmarillion  is the tale of the  Silmarilli  and things concering them, the 'tale' of 'Nârwen' and things concerning her could be 'Quenta Nârwenion ' . I thought of a few other titles, like  Gaudete Semper  or  Cor ad Cor , but I figured there's enough Catholic blogs with Latin names. Why not something a little different ?

      I, Donna Marie Lewis, with firm faith believe and profess everything that is contained in the symbol of faith: namely,   I believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven: By the power of the Holy Spirit, he was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered, died and was buried. On the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. I believe in the one holy catholic and apostolic church. I acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.  With firm faith I believe as well everything contained in God's word, written or handed down in tradition and proposed by the church--whether in solemn judgment or in the ordinary and universal magisterium--as divinely revealed and called for faith.  I also firmly accept and hold each and every thing that is proposed by that same church definitively with regard to teaching concerning faith or morals.  What is more, I adhere with religious submission of will and intellect to the teachings which either the Roman pontiff or the college of bishops enunciate when they exercise the authentic magisterium even if they proclaim those teachings in an act that is not definitive.

       My 100 things about me- Fifth and Final 20  81. I'm actually working on a Tolkien fanfic... it should be completed soon. 82. It's Elrond-angst.. if anybody has cause to be angsty, he certainly does. 83. IMNSHO, nobody should be permitted to write a Tolkien fanfic who hasn't read "The Lord of the Rings" at least three times and "The Silmarillion" at least once.  84. And, no, seeing the movie 27 times does  not  count... 85. Favorite fanfic author :  urlLink Thundera Tiger .  She has quite an ear for dialogue. 86. Favorite "Lord of the Rings" characters: Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn and Gandalf 87. Favorite "Silmarillion" characters: Finrod Felagund and Fëanor. Although I admit the latter is a trifle scary !  88. I am fond of the writings of C.S. Lewis. However, I prefer his apologetic works and "Till We Have Faces" to the Narnia books. 89. I've tried reading Charles Williams, but found his writing totally bewildering.  90. I've lost count of the number of times I've read "The Everlasting Man" by G.K. Chesterton. 91. Favorite Fr. Brown story: "The Sign of the Broken Sword" 92. I'm very excited that the Oratory here is founding a National Newman Library for study and research on the Venerable. 93. It makes me worried that so few people in the U.S. realize that Christians are being persecuted in many places in the world right now. 94. Another favorite quote: "God wouldn't have given us an intellect, if He didn't want us to think straight." - Msgr. Ronald Knox. 95. I love making the Seven Churches Visit on Holy Thursday night. 96. Favorite Old Testament books : Genesis and Song of Songs 97. Favorite New Testament books: The Gospel of John, Paul's Letter to the Philippians, and the Letter of James. 98. I need to pray before the Blessed Sacrament more often. 99. I need to learn to listen. 100. My favorite passage of Scripture: Philippians 4: 4-9 4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I shall say it again: rejoice!  5 Your kindness should be known to all. The Lord is near.  6 Have no anxiety at all, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God.  7 Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.  8 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.  9 Keep on doing what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me. Then the God of peace will be with you.

       Nihil Obstat noticed me !  Some people might think I'm crazy, but I think this is great. I am very new to this blogging thing. Therefore, I need all the help I can get, even from an  urlLink anonymus proofreader  . I have two return comments. First, I fixed the link, and it should work now. Second, I wouldn't call myself  fluent  in Elvish. Compared with some people, I am very much a beginner.  urlLink Helge Fauskanger , for example.

       Feast Day  Today is the feast of   urlLink The Forty Martyrs of England and Wales  .    "  Salvete, flores martyrum !  " - St. Philip Neri, to the students of the English College in Rome  " Can we religiously suppose that the blood of our martyrs, three centuries ago and since, shall never receive its recompense? Those priests, secular and regular, did they suffer for no end? or rather, for an end which is not yet accomplished? The long imprisonment, the fetid dungeon, the weary suspense, the tyrannous trial, the barbarous sentence, the savage execution, the rack, the gibbet, the knife, the cauldron, the numberless tortures of those holy victims, O my God, are they to have no reward? Are Thy martyrs to cry from under Thine altar for their loving vengeance on this guilty people, and to cry in vain? Shall they lose life, and not gain a better life for the children of those who persecuted them? " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  The Second Spring   UPDATE: I am glad to see that I am not the only one in the Blogosphere to notice this feast day. More information at the blogs of   urlLink Amy Welborn  ,  urlLink Gerard Serafin ,  urlLink Lane Core , and  urlLink Lover of Christian Art  .  Thank you all !

         My 100 things about me- Fourth 20  61. Most of my ancestors came from Ireland and Wales. One great-grandfather came from Italy. 62. I belong to the local St. David's Society, a group for people of Welsh ethnicity. 63. As far as I know, I'm the only Catholic member. 64. My favorite hymns to sing in Welsh:  Cwm Rhondda  and  Calon Lan  65. Every time I attend a  Gymanfa Ganu  (hymn-singing), I enjoy the singing, but then get a bit sad that Welsh Catholics are such a minority, both in Wales and here. 66. I have medals of Our Lady from two shrines: the Rue de Bac and Walsingham. 67. I wish I could visit the Holy Land but I have no money, and no desire to get shot at or blown up. 68. The first factor prevents me from visiting Rome, either. 69. Ditto for England.  70. I agree with Dr. Janet Smith that Pope Paul VI spoke prophetically in  Humanae Vitae  .  71. One of my favorite movie lines, ever..."It's not going to bed with a man that proves that you love him..It's getting up with him in the morning ! " - Henry Fonda, in  Yours, Mine  and Ours  72. I have a weakness for 'nature shows'. 73.  Part of this may be because when the subjects start acting like animals, at least they have the excuse of actually  being   animals. 74. I like Flannery O' Connor's fiction. 75. Favorite short story: "The Lame Shall Enter First" 76. Runners-up: "Revelation" and  "Parker's Back" 77. However, her letters in  The Habit of Being  make me  uneasy at times. 78. I think every artist or writer, but especially Christian ones, should read "Leaf by Niggle" by J.R.R. Tolkien.  79. It's not a bad idea for average Tolkien fans either. 80. I hope that maybe something I write, or do, will help to give someone a glimpse of the Mountains....

       My Favorite Prayer To Be Used Before the Blessed Sacrament   A Short Visit to the Blessed Sacrament before Meditation  In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.  I place myself in the presence of Him, in whose Incarnate Presence I am before I place myself there. I adore Thee, O my Saviour, present here as God and man, in soul and body, in true flesh and blood. I acknowledge and confess that I kneel before that Sacred Humanity, which was conceived in Mary's womb, and lay in Mary's bosom; which grew up to man's estate, and by the Sea of Galilee called the Twelve, wrought miracles, and spoke words of wisdom and peace; which in due season hung on the cross, lay in the tomb, rose from the dead, and now reigns in heaven. I praise, and bless, and give myself wholly to Him, who is the true Bread of my soul, and my everlasting joy.  - From  Meditations and Devotions  by Venerable John Henry Cardinal Newman, C.O.

       My 100 things about me- Third 20  41. I'm wondering when  urlLink Nihil Obstat  is going to find this blog. 42. I also wonder whether or not Nihil Obstat will correct one's Elvish as well as one's English. 43. I'm a bit sad that the Sindarin Dictionary Project's searchable dictionary is down.  44. The notice says it should be up again in September. I just hope they are just running a bit late, and they don't mean September 2003. 45. I know someone who is writing a "Middle-earth cookbook." 46. I like her, but she has some ideas about Tolkien which I think are a trifle odd. 47. On the other hand, her  lembas  is delicious. 48. My own 'cooking skills' are limited to heating up precooked stuff and making toast. 49. I miss the honey barbeque sauce at C.J. Barney's. 50. Favorite hymn: "Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence" 51. I'm also fond of "Firmly I Believe and Truly" and "Praise to the Holiest in the Height", for an obvious reason !  52. I found out that Thomas Carlyle is not to be trusted the hard way. I was assigned to write a paper on Oliver Cromwell in college. I saw Carlyle's biography and thought, "Hey, he's a famous author, right ? I'll read his book, since I have to write this paper anyway." I read it. Fortunately, I also read another biography of Cromwell which lets you in on some stuff Carlyle skips..like the fact that the man ordered massacres of women and children in Ireland, and sundry other unsavory points. From Carlyle's book, you'd think the man was a saint. 53. I believe it was Carlyle who denigrated the Venerable Newman as having the intellect of 'a moderately-sized rabbit.'  When I read that quote, (in a much later college class) I remember thinking, "At least Newman didn't have the gall to do a haigiographical book on Torquemada." 54. Actually, I believe comparing Cromwell to Torquemada is unfair to the latter.  55. I have come to All Saints Day parties as the following:       St. Jeanne D'arc       St. Margaret Clitherow       Blessed Margaret Pole       St. Perpetua       St. Winifred       Blessed Julian of Norwich 56. My friend Kate calls me 'Julian' because I was dressed as Blessed Julian when we met.  57. Favorite magazine :   urlLink First Things  58. I like icons, and even icon-style painting of more modern provenance. 59. One of the reasons is because Eastern-style angels don't look like pretty teenaged girls with wings.  60. I think this is one of the most glorious quotes ever....      "I put before you the one great thing to love on earth:the Blessed Sacrament.... There you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon earth, and more than that: Death, by the divine paradox, that which ends life and demands the surrender of all, and yet, by the taste (or foretaste) of which alone can what you seek in your earthly relationships (love, faithfulness, joy) be maintained, or take on that complexion of reality, of eternal endurance, which every man's heart desires."                  J.R.R. Tolkien, to Michael Tolkien, March 8, 1941,  The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien

       My 100 things about me- Second 20  21. I have an alto voice. 22. I'm in the choir which sings at noon Mass. 23. I think our choir director's taste in music is excellent...lots of Gregorian chant and 16th century polyphony ! 24. I love Sunday Vespers with Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. 25. My confirmation name is Joan, for St. Jeanne D'arc. 26. IMHO, the English and Welsh martyrs are woefully neglected in the United States. ( Ever try to find a St. Edmund Campion prayer card ?) 27. I'm puzzled by the fact that their feast day isn't even given as an  option  in the US Sacramentary.  28.  Only one Contemporary Christian type musician wrote songs that actually impressed me : the late Rich Mullins. 29. I had never met the man, but I cried and prayed for him when I heard of his death.  30. I'm a cradle Catholic, but I have at least three people in my ancestry who became Catholic as adults: one grandfather, one great-grandfather, and one great-great grandfather. 31. I'm addicted to conversion stories. 32. I have a bad habit of checking out books of literary criticism in bookstores. This is bad because the inanities on Tolkien, Chesterton, and even Venerable Newman I sometimes find are a serious temptation to uncharitable thoughts.  33. Even worse, I check out Tolkien fanfiction on the web. A small part of it is very good. A lot of it is utter garbage.  34. For example, why in the name of Eru would anybody take the writings of a devout Catholic and distort the relationships of characters into 'slash', as homosexual relationships in fanfic are called ? I find this incomphrehensible.  35. Controlling my temper is something I really have to work hard at. 36. I sympathized with  urlLink Mr. Bettinelli's blog  here.  37. I'm somewhat heartened by knowing certain saints had trouble with their tempers, too. 38. I love this quote... a friend of Msgr.Knox was told to pull himself together. He replied "I haven't got any together." 39. I have got to read "The Second Spring" again 40. It's not easy to 'gaudete semper'. God give me the grace to try.

       My 100 things about me- First 20   1. I'm 4' 11" tall. 2. Brown hair, brown eyes 3. Pale, but with freckles 4. I have a degree in writing. 5. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a job in which I actually use my degree. 6. I believe everything the Catholic Church teaches, as is stated below. 7. I am a Secular Oratorian. I'll be explaining that later. 8. IMHO, St. Philip Neri is not as well known as he ought to be. 9. And he is somewhat misunderstood by people who only know him superficially. 10. I pray for the canonization of Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., every day. 11. IMHO, his teaching on conscience has been distorted beyond recognition by certain folks.   12. I absolutely, positively WILL NOT vote for anybody who supports the 'right' to dismember babies. 13. I have voted third party in the past when no pro-life candidate was on a major party ticket. 14. I have skipped voting in a particular race when no pro-life candidate was available at all. 15. The best explication of the doctrine of the Trinity I've ever found is in  Theology and Sanity  by F.J. Sheed. 16. I've discovered that domestic rats make wonderful pets, though their lifespan is short enough to cause some heartbreak. 17. I've been a Tolkien fanatic for 20 years. 18. I had some problems with the movie. 19. Nevertheless, I've seen it 19 times... 20. And the next one can't come fast enough !

       The Cause  Those few people who have noticed this blog may also have noticed that I have a link to the Newman Reader on the left. I happen to believe that his cause is important. If anyone would care to pray for his canonization, I would be most grateful. Here is a prayer that one could use:  Eternal Father, You led JOHN HENRY NEWMAN to follow the kindly light of Truth, and he obediently responded to your heavenly calls at any cost. As writer, preacher, counsellor and educator, as pastor, Oratorian, and servant of the poor he laboured to build up Your Kingdom.  Grant that through your Vicar on Earth we may hear the words, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter into the company of the canonized saints."  May You manifest Your servant's power of intercession by even extraordinary answers to the prayers of the faithful throughout the world. We pray particularly for our intentions in his name and in the Name of Jesus Christ Your Son our Lord.  Amen.   Please report any favours received to: The Postulator, The Oratory, Hagley Road, Birmingham B16 8UE, England    Note: This is from a prayer card printed in England. That is why it follows British spelling rules....

       From today's homily  Our deacon Michael was preaching today at the noon Mass. (His ordination to the priesthood is scheduled to be on December 28. I'll probably be blogging about it when it gets a bit closer.) He had a quote from St. Augustine of Hippo which I can't reproduce exactly, but which ran something like this: "As the coin with the image of Caesar was to be rendered to Caesar, we, who are made in the image of God, are to be rendered to God, entirely, in all that we have and all that we are." This is something for me to think about whenever I get too wrapped up in claiming anything  as 'mine'.....

       All Souls  I'm not sure that I will be able to blog tommorow, so I will post for All Souls Day now.   The Golden Prison - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  WEEP not for me, when I am gone,  Nor spend thy faithful breath  In grieving o'er the spot or hour  Of all-enshrouding death;   Nor waste in idle praise thy love  On deeds of head or hand,  Which live within the living Book,  Or else are writ in sand;   But let it be thy best of prayers,  That I may find the grace  To reach the holy house of toll,  The frontier penance-place,   To reach that golden palace bright,  Where souls elect abide,  Waiting their certain call to Heaven,   With Angels at their side;   Where hate, nor pride, nor fear torments  The transitory guest,  But in the willing agony  He plunges, and is blest.   And as the fainting patriarch gain'd  His needful halt mid-way,  And then refresh'd pursued his path,  Where up the mount it lay,   So pray, that, rescued from the storm  Of heaven's eternal ire,  I may lie down, then rise again,  Safe, and yet saved by fire.    urlLink   The Dream of Gerontius  , also by the Venerable, is too long to blog here completely. IMHO, it would make fine reading for All Souls Day.

       St. Philip Post- Part Three  Catacombs of San Sebastiano  It was during this time, with Philip spending his days and nights in service and prayer, that one of the great events of his life occurred. One of his favorite places to pray was the Catacombs of San Sebastiano, where he could withdraw from the busy pace of the city above and also be reminded of the lives of the early Christians. On Pentecost, 1544, while Philip was immersed in prayer in the catacombs, he had a mystical experience in which a ball of fire appeared and went down his throat to his heart. He then felt this fire within him, and his heart seemed to be expanding to hold it. While this was very much an experience of the spirit, it had marked physical aftereffects, including an inner heat which astonished many, and heartbeats which, when Philip was at prayer or otherwise spiritually moved, were audible to bystanders, sometimes to the point of making the room shake.   St. Philip Neri Quotes:     "He who runs away from one cross will meet a bigger one on his road."      "In the matter of purity there is no greater danger than not fearing the danger: when a man does not distrust himself,       and is without fear, it is all over with him."      "Not everything which is better in itself is better for each man in particular."      "Fathers and mothers of families should bring up their children virtuously, looking at them rather as God's children rather than       their own; and to count life, and health, and all they possess, as loans which they hold from God."

       From the homily  Deacon Michael was preaching again today. The part of the homily I found most memorable was when he remarked that in a few minutes, we would be enacting the scene from the first reading: gathering around the Lamb of God in our earthly liturgy as the victorious ones in Heaven do in the Heavenly Liturgy. This is not original, of course, but it is something we need to be reminded of continually. There's a good book on this subject, by  urlLink  Dr. Scott Hahn  .

        Blessed All Saints Day !  All Saints Meditation- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. 1. PLACE yourself in the presence of God, kneeling with hands clasped. 2. Read slowly and devoutly  Apocalypse , chap. vii. verses 9-17. 3. Bring all this before you as in a picture. 4. Then say to Him whatever comes into your mind to say; for instance:  "They are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His Temple." "They shall not hunger nor thirst any more;" "The Lamb shall lead them to the fountains of living waters."  (1) My dear Lord and Saviour, shall I ever see Thee in heaven? This world is very beautiful, very attractive, and there are many things and persons whom I love in it. But Thou art the most beautiful and best of all. Make me acknowledge this with my heart, as well as by faith and in my reason.  (2) My Lord, I know nothing here below lasts; nothing here below satisfies. Pleasures come and go; I quench my thirst and am thirsty again. But the saints in heaven are always gazing on Thee, and drinking in eternal blessedness from Thy dear and gracious and most awful and most glorious countenance.  5. Conclusion.May my lot be with the saints.

       For the Feast...  This is the vigil of the Feast of All Saints.  Relics of Saints - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto Him."    "THE Fathers are in dust, yet live to God:"   So says the Truth; as if the motionless clay   Still held the seeds of life beneath the sod,   Smouldering and struggling till the judgment-day.    And hence we learn with reverence to esteem   Of these frail houses, though the grave confines;   Sophist may urge his cunning tests, and deem   That they are earth;but they are heavenly shrines.

       Meat-and-Potato Catholics  This is from the October 2002 issue of  urlLink First Things .   (The following report is submitted by our ubiquitous correspondent George Weigel.)  Outraged commentary quickly followed Bishop Timothy M. Dolans June 25 remark that his first priority as the tenth Archbishop of Milwaukee would be to talk with those meat-and-potato Catholics who are the strength of any diocese. Bishop Dolan, whose fondness for the table is not entirely disguised by clerical black, made the comment at a press conference introducing him to his new archdiocese, where he was to be installed on August 28.   Meeting in emergency session, the executive committee of the Catholic Theological Society of America adopted a resolution condemning Dolans insensitivity to our animal companions and asserting that vegetarianism was the more excellent way of Christian nutrition. The Society noted that it had banned steaks from its banquet menus for decades, substituting tofu salads as more responsive to the moral demands of sustainable development, a point argued in the Societys study of eco-ethics, People Are the Problem.  In a signed editorial in the liberal Catholic magazine Commonwealth, editor Margaret McGillicuddy Steinflyte claimed that Bishop Dolans statement of priorities was redolent of the boys locker-room ambiance of this pontificate. A preferential option for meat-and-potato Catholics, Ms. Steinflyte claimed, would disenfranchise those hundreds of brie-and-chardonnay, spirit-of-Vatican II Catholics who form the core of her magazines regular readership. In a separate article in the same issue, Commonwealth columnist Paul Bauhaus suggested that the extravagant carnality of Bishop Dolans gustatory imagery and its attempt to sacramentalize a body function, eating was in fact a sly strategy for sneaking John Paul IIs theology of the body into an archdiocese where it was hitherto unknownwhich has certainly been a blessing for Milwaukee.  A close student of the American hierarchy, Father Thomas Reach, S.J., told the Washington Post that, while it was customary for a hefty bishop to follow a lean bishop in Milwaukee, he was concerned that Bishop Dolans reference to meat-and-potato Catholics would reinforce Milwaukees image as a stolid, bowling-alley townan image my colleagues at Marquette, a university in the Jesuit tradition, have worked so hard to erase. Moreover, Fr. Reach noted, to lay such stress on meat and potatoes was pastorally insensitive, given Milwaukees longstanding commitment to frozen custard as the signature local dish. Bishop Dolans claim to be a man of tradition is somewhat questionable, given his failure to even mention frozen custard at his inaugural press conference, said Fr. Reach.  Criticism was also heard from Catholic commentators in the secular press. In a bitter attack on Bishop Dolan, James Careall, the Boston Globe columnist, argued that meat-and-potatoes Catholicism is inherently anti-Semitic, as John Chrysostom made unmistakably clear in his fourth-century sermon on Acts 9:9-16. Veteran Washington Post columnist Mary McGrouchy wrote in a more elegiac mode. With John XXIII and the Kennedy White House, we thought, we prayed, that we had put meat-and-potatoes Catholicism behind us, Ms. McGrouchy reminisced. When will Catholicism in America develop even a surface level of sophistication?  Maureen Dowdy was in a less gentle mood on the New York Times op-ed page. Bishop Dolans adolescent wisecrack is of a piece with President Bushs fondness for cowboy boots. When are these guys going to grow up? Following a pattern established in the first months of 2002 on the Times op-ed page, Bill Killerbee took Ms. Dowdy one better, with a biting critique of Dolans slash-and-burn ecclesiastical style, reminiscent of such scoundrels of Catholic history as Torquemada and Pope John Paul II.  This firestorm of deprecation was challenged by Stanislaw Miesozerny, a cattle and dairy farmer in Dodge County, northwest of Milwaukee. I think what Bishop Dolan said is great, Mr. Miesozerny, a 1962 Marquette University philosophy major, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Everyone who studies the Summa understands that beef cattle achieve the final end of their existence as New York Strips at the Outback. Thats just good Thomism.  Besides, he continued, these vegans want us to abstain from all milk products. And you know what that means for Wisconsin. Im looking forward to Archbishop Dolan endorsing our campaign to change Wisconsins license-plate slogan. Americas Dairyland is a little lame. My meat-and-potatoes Catholic friends think it ought to be Eat Cheese or Die.

       St. Philip Post- Part Two  Beginnings in Rome  After two to three years, Philip told Uncle Romolo that he appreciated his kindness, but he was not cut out to be a businessman. Philip, now about 20, headed for Rome.  He supported himself by tutoring the two sons of an expatriate Florentine customs officer named Gaelotto del Caccia, and attended theology classes at the Roman University. After a time, he ceased attending classes, and devoted the time to intensive prayer and service, most particularly helping the sick in Rome's hospitals and the pilgrims who came to Rome. Philip, with the help of his confessor, Fr. Persanio Rosa, established the Confraternity of the Most Holy Trinity for the Pilgrims in 1548, specifically to look after the weary and often destitute travelers. This proved to be an important task, most particularly in the Holy Year of 1549, when huge numbers of pilgrims flooded the city.   Throughout his life in Rome, Philip, though later known for his affability and sense of humor, lived a life that was abstemious in the extreme. His room was always sparsely furnished, and his food consisted almost entirely of bread, olives and maybe a few other vegetables. He almost never ate meat, until his old age, when his doctor ordered him to do so, and he drank wine which had been watered a great deal, or even plain water- very untypical for a 16th century Italian. His clothes were known for being simple and rather cheap, which was remarkable enough in an age when display in clothes was everywhere, even among clerics, who instead of wearing the prescribed cassocks , tended to compete with laymen in wearing the styles of the day, complete with silk linings and gigantic ruffs. (When the Pope decreed that priests should dress simply, cynics quipped that now clerics would have to leave their velvet boots at the door of St. Peter's.)   St. Philip Neri Quotes:     "Cheerfulness strengthens the heart and makes us persevere in a good life; therefore the servant of God ought always to      be in good spirits."      "A man without prayer is like an animal without the use of reason."      "We must never trust ourselves, for it is the devil's way to get us to feel secure, and then to make us fall."      "To be without pity for other men's falls, is an evident sign that we shall fall ourselves shortly."

       St. Philip Post- Part One  I promised earlier to blog about my being a Secular Oratorian. However, I've been trying to figure out where to begin. After all, most people don't know what an Oratorian proper is, let alone a Secular one. I thought of the article I have written for the Oratory's new website, on our founder, St. Philip Neri. The new site itself is not up yet, but I'm going to blog from the article. There will probably be some changes before it goes on the website, but I'll blog it as is in small parts, along with quotes from St. Philip himself.   Who was St. Philip Neri?  Philip Romolo Neri was born July 21st, 1515, in Florence, in what is now Italy. (Italy did not become a united country until the 19th century.) His parents were Francesco Neri, a notary, and Lucretia da Mosciano. He was the third of five children, but the oldest and youngest children died when they were infants. Philip was taught by the Dominicans of San Marco, a community probably best known for the great artist-friar Blessed Fra Angelico.  Florence had been an independent republic, but in 1532, when Philip was 17, the powerful Medici family conquered the city. Since Francesco Neri had been prominent among those who opposed the Medici regime, he sent his son away, probably hoping that Philip would be able to prosper better in a city where his family's politics were not a liability. Philip went to San Germano, a busy trading city at the foot of Monte Cassino, home of a famous Benedictine abbey. His 'uncle Romolo', (actually, a cousin of his father) was a merchant in San Germano, moderately wealthy and without any children of his own. Philip's father sent Philip there to learn the business. He most likely hoped that Romolo Neri would eventually leave his property to his 'nephew'.  We know little about the time Philip spent in San Germano, but from the few details we have Philip seems to have been far more interested in prayer and his relationship with God than in becoming a wealthy merchant. He spent time in various chapels in the area, and became familiar with the Benedictine community there. It is thought that Philip gained some of his understanding of stability, as well as his love for the Church Fathers, from this contact with the ancient Order of St. Benedict.   St. Philip Neri Quotes:  "Well ! When shall we have a mind to begin to do good?"   "He who wishes to be perfectly obeyed should give few orders."   "To mortify one's passion, no matter how small, is a greater help in the spiritual life than many abstinences and fasts."  Taken from  If God Be With Us: The Maxims of St. Philip Neri , ed. Fr. Frederick Faber, C.O., Gracewing)

       Sorry for the rant  I think I may have been out of line yesterday. After all, all we have is a secular news source, and we all know how reliable they are, don't we ? There is one thing that does tell in favor of this couple: since there are quadruplets, it seems they did not 'selectively reduce the embryos', i.e. kill a couple of the unborn children in order to 'give the others a better chance.'

       Things like this are one of the reasons I'm glad I'm not in charge   urlLink This is repulsive.  My natural inclination would be to deny these children Baptism unless the 'parents' were to give them up for adoption by a married couple. It's terribly unpastoral of me, I know. Then again, I'm not a pastor !   It may seem less than charitable as well. However, it seems that nobody is giving these guys any indication that they are living in sin, causing horrific scandal, and poised to continually give scandal to these children. Also, these poor little ones were 'manufactured'  rather than conceived naturally, which is sinful as well.   However, it isn't up to me. That's probably a very good thing. If it  were  up to me, I'd be tempted to take a lot of smoldering wicks and dunk them in ice water and rip apart a good many bruised reeds. I fear it wouldn't be limited to cases as utterly sick as this one, and I'd end up turning the Church into a sect. See  Enthusiasm  by Msgr. Ronald Knox for what I mean by that.  What I can do is pray: that the eyes of all involved may be opened, that the children may truly be brought up in the Faith (though it seems unlikely it will happen), most of all that the Lord of Mercy might purify my heart, so that I may see with love untainted by anger and revulsion:  Kyrie, eleison!      Christe, eleison!      Kyrie, eleison !

       V.I.P.  or Very Important Passage....  "Conscience has rights because it has duties; but in this age, with a large portion of the public, it is the very right and freedom of conscience to dispense with conscience, to ignore a Lawgiver and Judge, to be independent of unseen obligations. It becomes a licence to take up any or no religion, to take up this or that and let it go again, to go to church, to go to chapel, to boast of being above all religions and to be an impartial critic of each of them. Conscience is a stern monitor, but in this century it has been superseded by a counterfeit, which the eighteen centuries prior to it never heard of, and could not have mistaken for it, if they had. It is the right of self-will. " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., from  A Letter Addressed to the Duke of Norfolk on Occasion of Mr. Gladstone's Recent Expostulation  ....published in 1875 !  IMHO, except for the 'eighteen centuries' part, this could have been written now rather than 127 years ago.

       Added Links   I've added some more links on the right. The one to the Oratory ministry is the only current page. I'm actually helping to create a new one. (No, I haven't suddenly become a tech whiz. I'm writing text for the new site.) The official Confederation of Oratories site is in Italian. I've sent them some requests about getting it translated, but I've had no response as of yet. As for "The Red Songbook of Westmarch"... well, I'm afraid parts of it are a bit crude. However, other parts are  very   funny, so I'm linking to it anyhow. (I can't hear certain songs now without hearing some of these parodies in my mind !)

       Music at noon Mass  Processional Hymn : "Love Divine, All Loves Excelling" Offertory : "O Lord My God, To Thee"- Jacques Arcadelt (1510-1568) Communion : "Panis Angelicus" - Camille Saint-Saëns  (1835-1921) Recessional Hymn: "Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise"   A bit of an explanation is probably in order. While the congregation sings the Processional and Recessional hymns along with the choir, it's up to the choir members to sing the more difficult Offertory and Communion pieces. The congregation also sings, or rather chants, the various "Mass parts": the Kyrie, the Gloria, etc.  This week was a bit unusual in that Camille Saint-Saëns is a much more modern composer than the ones whose works we usually sing. Jacques Arcadelt is a more typical choice.

       Dear, dear...  I'm afraid he just  urlLink doesn't get it . What's really a bit odd about the post is this part:   Frankly, I find it quite egotistical that any person/church/denomination would refuse fellowship to a fellow believer in Christ over a man-made interpretation of what actually transpires during communion. Don't you think if it was that important an issue, the Bible would have something to say about it?   48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died; 50 this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world." 52 The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?" 53 Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever."   Gospel of St. John,  6:48-58    I think that  does  say something about it. One could also argue that having a closed communion is charitable, citing First Corinthians Chapter 11: 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself.    What's really fascinating though is that this blogger is presuming to criticize churches with a closed communion without understanding that for the largest Christian bodies which have closed communion (Catholic and Orthodox),  the teaching on the Real Presence is not considered   a man-made teaching   but  a non-negotiable fact   believed since the time of the Apostles and no more expendable than the teaching on the Resurrection.

       Response to Another Blogger   I was a trifled miffed by   urlLink  this post . While I do eat and have a roof over my head, I've been out of work for quite some time and 'comfortable' I'm not. I don't own a car, or a computer, and I blog from the library.  Nevertheless, the babies come first, always. I would disagree that other issues are 'equally important.' IMHO, as long as legalized slaughter of the innocents is public policy, poverty, horrendous a  problem as it is, must take a back seat. As Flannery O' Connor put it in a title of one of her stories, you can't be any poorer than dead.

       St. Philip Post- Part Nine  Santa Maria in Vallicella  This incident helped Philip see just how vulnerable the ministry of the Oratory was. At San Giovanni, one man had kept the entire ministry from being destroyed, while at San Girolamo they were dependant on the goodwill of the confraternity. Without having a church and a house of their own, the work of the Oratory could be stopped by the whims of outsiders. Also, the numbers of young men who wanted to follow Philip's way of life in community was growing, and it was decided that having a permanent place of their own was a necessity. After the community had looked into several possibilities, the Holy Father suggested that they take over the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella. It was located near the crowded center of Rome, and particularly close to the Papal Court. As many members of the Court, including a great many Cardinals, were now coming to Philip for advice and sometimes for Confession, the Pope believed having Philip in close proximity would be a good thing.  Unfortunately, Santa Maria in Vallicella was a tiny, dilapidated church, and it was decided that it should be torn down and replaced. This was done and construction on the new Santa Maria in Vallicella was begun in1575. While the first Mass was offered in February of 1577, construction on parts of the church continued until after Philip's death. Since it was replacing the former building, it became known as the 'New Church' or 'Chiesa Nuova'. The church is still generally called the  Chiesa Nuova ,even though it is now over 400 years old.  At the same time, the community was canonically recognized. After the Chiesa Nuova was available for Mass, members moved into various houses in the area. The first official assembly of the Congregation of the Oratory took place March 15, 1577, in the church itself. On May 8, 1577, Philip was officially elected "Provost", or superior, of the community. From the beginning, the crucial feature of having all the members vote on important matters was present. There were still problems. The Oratory had some trouble keeping vocations, partly because of a lack of housing. Another problem was that while the rest of the community had settled in around the new church, Philip was reluctant to leave San Girolamo, where he had lived for so long. It took six years and an order from the Holy Father to get Philip to move, and he continued to visit San Girolamo until he died.   St. Philip Neri Quotes: "Let young men be cheerful, and indulge in the recreations proper to their age, provided they keep out of the way of sin." "Nothing is more dangerous for beginners in the spiritual life than to want to play the master, and to guide and convert   others." "There is nothing the devil fears so much, or so much tries to hinder, as prayer." "If God be with us, then there is no one else left to fear."

       St. Philip Post- Part Eight   Some Setbacks to Ministry  Philip endured various types of problems affecting his ministry. Some were relatively minor, such as the two unfriendly sacristans he had to put up with early on, who gave him the worst vestments, hid the tabernacle key from him, and created other petty annoyances. Some were much more serious, as when Cardinal Rosario of the Holy Office temporarily forbade Philip to hear confessions or hold the Visit to the Seven Churches, and accused him of attempting to form a new sect. Through it all, Philip remained patient and obedient, silencing his followers when they criticized those who were against him. Despite the various difficulties, the Oratory continued to take form. One major turning point occurred when Philip was asked to take over the ministry at San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, the church in Rome that was built by, and ministered to, Florentine expatriates. Philip agreed to help, though only because a Florentine delegation visited the Holy Father and requested that he indicate that Philip was to undertake this. Philip acquiesced, but did not leave San Girolamo himself. Instead he sent several of his young followers there, after they had been ordained. This small community lived at San Giovanni for ten years, living lives of prayer and service of many types. However, a member joined the community there who did not live peaceably with the others. After great deliberation, and Philip's own repeated intervention, he was expelled. He then went about spreading lies about the community,and, incredibly, managed to get the trustees of San Giovanni on his side, with the exception of one man. This one loyal trustee was all that kept the Oratorians from being thrown out of San Giovanni.    St. Philip Neri Quotes: "He who wishes to be wise without true Wisdom, or saved without the Savior, is not well, but sick-is not wise, but a fool." "Nothing unites the soul to God more closely, or breeds contempt of the world sooner, than being harassed and                  distressed."  "We ought to pray to God persistently to increase in us every day the light and heat of his goodness." "We ought to remember what Christ said, that not he who begins, but he that perseveres to the end, shall be saved."

       St. Philip Post- Part Seven   Growth of the Oratory  Philip became more and more sought after as a confessor, and the Oratory meetings grew larger and more popular. Yet Philip faced opposition as well, which the jokes and such he was famed for did little to discourage. Some of it was from people who seem to have been less than enthusiastic about living the Gospel, but much of it was from people who thought his methods were too radical and extreme. Philip encouraged Confession and Holy Communion on a much more frequent basis than was then customary. Indeed, many of the early Oratorians went to Philip for confession every day, and to Communion several times a week, in an age when confession andCommunion a few times a year were the norm. Also, there were those, some of them in positions of authority, who thought the huge numbers of people assembling for the pilgrimage to the Seven Churches might be dangerous. Some distorted information seems to have been bandied about as well. Since Philip allowed laymen to give talks at the Oratorian meetings, someone said he was allowing laymen to preach at Mass, which was, of course, not true.   St. Philip Neri Quotes: "A man ought to set about putting his good resolutions into practice, and not change them lightly." "Nothing helps a man more than prayer." "Where there is no great mortification there is no great sanctity." "Even in the midst of the crowd we can be going on to perfection."

       I should have guessed...    urlLink     what foreign language are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      I actually prefer Sindarin, but High Elven is fine, too.... What I don't understand is why the quiz maker chose Haldir to illustrate Quenya when he would have spoken Silvan-accented Sindarin. Surely Elrond or Galadriel would have been a better choice ?

       St. Philip Post- Part Six  St. Philip and Humor  Perhaps what Philip is best known for in many circles is his sense of humor. Yet few people seem to understand the motivations behind many of his eccentricities. These were twofold, yet intertwined. One reason was connected with Philip's intense and profoundly mystical prayer life. This led to him having difficulties in keeping himself from going into an ecstatic state, in which he was unaware of anything around him, whenever he celebrated Mass, read Scripture or the lives of the Saints, or even looked at certain crucifixes or other works of sacred art. Philip found that contact with the mundane, particularly the humorous, could help him 'keep his feet on the ground', so to speak. This led to such things as his reading of a book of funny stories before he began to celebrate Mass, to take the most famous example. Even this measure sometimes failed to keep him from losing touch with his surroundings, and eventually he received permission to celebrate Mass privately, which, some noted, tended to take him hours.  The second, and more important, reason was Philip's fear of pride, either the various forms of secular pride that were rampant in Renaissance Rome or the more insidious spiritual pride which can ruin the life of any Christian. Here, humor was his tool for keeping this deadly poison from infecting his life, and the lives of the many people whose lives he influenced. As his reputation for holiness of life spread, he took pains to make himself, not respected or revered, but a figure of fun, thus discouraging people who wanted to 'canonize' him while he was still alive. How could a priest known for sometimes showing up in church with his cloak inside out, or for occasionally wearing a cushion on his head through the streets, be a saint? Thus, he surrounded the deep mysticism and burning charity within his heart with an exterior which drew the humble, the simple, and those who could laugh at themselves, while tending to repel those who cherished pride in rank, dignity or external 'holiness'.   St. Philip Neri Quotes:  "He who desires ecstasies and visions does not know what he is desiring."   "Let the young man look after the flesh, and the old man after avarice, and we shall all be saints together."   "The fruit we ought to get from prayer is to do what is pleasing to the Lord."  "The true way to advance in holy virtues, is to persevere in a holy cheerfulness."

       On the election  I have mixed feelings about the result. From what I've seen, it seems that a good many pro-life candidates won across the country, which is, of course, wonderful. On the other hand, the voters of my state have given the governorship to a man who once called Kate Michelman  'a saint' . What is really sad is... it wasn't even close. We handed power to a pawn of the baby-butcherers on a silver platter.  God have mercy on the state of Pennsylvania.

         I guess I ought to be used to it by now...  but I'm afraid I'm not.  What is up with the people who try to make Venerable Newman (though they seldom use that title for him) into some sort of icon of theological dissent ?  I'm saying this after reading the November issue of  urlLink First Things . The first part of the section "The Public Square" is entitled "Mr. Wills For the Prosecution". In it, a description is given of the recent book by Mr. Garry Wills entitled  Why I am a Catholic  . The book is apparently supposed to be a response to those who said one of his previous books was not Catholic. Unfortunately, if this review it accurate, he is proving their point in spades.  The basic thrust of the book appears to be that the papacy has been pretty much ruining things since the beginning of the Church. Among various theological and moral bizarreness of the type which is all too familiar (abortion is OK, the Assumption of Our Lady never happened, the Virgin Birth was not a 'biological fact', etc.), Mr. Wills apparently added a new wrinkle which really floored me. He seems to have stated that the Catholic martyrs of England and Wales were really traitors and deserved what they got...beheading, hanging, drawing and quartering, and so forth. Lord, have mercy on this deceived soul. How can somebody calling himself a Catholic dishonor the witness of those who who were murdered for celebrating the Sacraments or for hiding priests from the butchers of Tyburn ?  Mr. Wills has the gall to claim that his heroes are Venerable Newman and, believe it or not, G.K. Chesterton (!). I leave the defense of Chesterton's honor for another day, but here are a few quotes from the Venerable Mr. Wills seems to have missed: "Deeply do I feel, ever will I protest, for I can appeal to the ample testimony of history to bear me out, that, in questions of right and wrong, there is nothing really strong in the whole world, nothing decisive and operative, but the voice of him, to whom have been committed the keys of the kingdom and the oversight of Christ's flock. The voice of Peter is now, as it ever has been, a real authority, infallible when it teaches, prosperous when it commands, ever taking the lead wisely and distinctly in its own province, adding certainty to what is probable, and persuasion to what is certain. Before it speaks, the most saintly may mistake; and after it has spoken, the most gifted must obey." -  Cathedra Sempiterna  , 1852 "Conscience has rights because it has duties; but in this age, with a large portion of the public, it is the very right and freedom of conscience to dispense with conscience, to ignore a Lawgiver and Judge, to be independent of unseen obligations. It becomes a licence to take up any or no religion, to take up this or that and let it go again, to go to church, to go to chapel, to boast of being above all religions and to be an impartial critic of each of them. Conscience is a stern monitor, but in this century it has been superseded by a counterfeit, which the eighteen centuries prior to it never heard of, and could not have mistaken for it, if they had. It is the right of self-will." -  Letter to the Duke of Norfolk  1875 Can we religiously suppose that the blood of our martyrs, three centuries ago and since, shall never receive its recompense? Those priests, secular and regular, did they suffer for no end? or rather, for an end which is not yet accomplished? The long imprisonment, the fetid dungeon, the weary suspense, the tyrannous trial, the barbarous sentence, the savage execution, the rack, the gibbet, the knife, the cauldron, the numberless tortures of those holy victims, O my God, are they to have no reward? Are Thy martyrs to cry from under Thine altar for their loving vengeance on this guilty people, and to cry in vain? Shall they lose life, and not gain a better life for the children of those who persecuted them? Is this Thy way, O my God, righteous and true? Is it according to Thy promise, O King of saints, if I may dare talk to Thee of justice? Did not Thou Thyself pray for Thine enemies upon the cross, and convert them? Did not Thy first Martyr win Thy great Apostle, then a persecutor, by his loving prayer? And in that day of trial and desolation for England, when hearts were pierced through and through with Mary's woe, at the crucifixion of Thy body mystical, was not every tear that flowed, and every drop of blood that was shed, the seeds of a future harvest, when they who sowed in sorrow were to reap in joy? " - "The Second Spring", 1852 " I rejoice to say, to one great mischief I have from the first opposed myself. For thirty, forty, fifty years I have resisted to the best of my powers the spirit of liberalism in religion. Never did Holy Church need champions against it more sorely than now, when, alas! it is an error overspreading, as a snare, the whole earth; and on this great occasion, when it is natural for one who is in my place to look out upon the world, and upon Holy Church as in it, and upon her future, it will not, I hope, be considered out of place, if I renew the protest against it which I have made so often." -  Biglietto Speech , 1879

       From  Meditations and Devotions   I think this is appropriate for a day when the Gospel was about Christ as the Good Shepherd.   Jesus our Guide and Guardian  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  There are men who think that God is so great that He disdains to look down upon us, our doings and our fortunes. But He who did not find it beneath His Majesty to make us, does not think it beneath Him to observe and to visit us. He says Himself in the Gospel: "Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? and not one of them is forgotten before God. Yea, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows." He determined from all eternity that He would create us. He settled our whole fortuneand, if He did not absolutely decree to bring us to heaven, it is because we have free will, and by the very constitution of our nature He has put it in part out of His own power, for we must do our part, if to heaven we attain. But He has done every thing short of this. He died for us all upon the Cross, that, if it were possible to save us, we might be saved. And He calls upon us lovingly, begging us to accept the benefit of His meritorious and most Precious Blood. And those who trust Him He takes under His special protection. He marks out their whole life for them; He appoints all that happens to them; He guides them in such way as to secure their salvation; He gives them just so much of health, of wealth, of friends, as is best for them; He afflicts them only when it is for their good; He is never angry with them. He measures out just that number of years which is good for them; and He appoints the hour of their death in such a way as to secure their perseverance up to it.  Let us pray for ourselves and for all our needs.  O my Lord and Saviour, in Thy arms I am safe; keep me and I have nothing to fear; give me up and I have nothing to hope for. I know not what will come upon me before I die. I know nothing about the future, but I rely upon Thee. I pray Thee to give me what is good for me; I pray Thee to take from me whatever may imperil my salvation; I pray Thee not to make me rich, I pray Thee not to make me very poor; but I leave it all to Thee, because Thou knowest and I do not. If Thou bringest pain or sorrow on me, give me grace to bear it wellkeep me from fretfulness and selfishness. If Thou givest me health and strength and success in this world, keep me ever on my guard lest these great gifts carry me away from Thee. O Thou who didst die on the Cross for me, even for me, sinner as I am, give me to know Thee, to believe on Thee, to love Thee, to serve Thee; ever to aim at setting forth Thy glory; to live to and for Thee; to set a good example to all around me; give me to die just at that time and in that way which is most for Thy glory, and best for my salvation.

       St. Philip Post- Part Five  St. Philip and Followers  Philip and his followers were known for many good works, including continuing to assist pilgrims, and most of all working  in the hospitals. The hospitals of the day were places where those who were ill, but not wealthy enough to be nursed at home, were warehoused, with little in the way of care or nursing given to them. Thus, Philip's followers were providing a much-needed service in giving basic care to those who were ill. One of his penitents, an ex-soldier named  urlLink  Camillus de Lellis , was especially devoted to this work, and eventually founded a community to serve the sick. He was later canonized, and his community, now known formally as the Order of St. Camillus Servants of the Sick, informally as the  urlLink Camillians , continues to minister to the ill all over the world.  Another activity, and perhaps the one which attracted the most attention, was Philip's practice of praying at the seven basilicas of Rome. He began to take his followers on these mini-pilgrimages of prayer, and eventually they grew to huge sizes, with thousands of people. Philip was especially eager to have these excursions available as a prayerful alternative to the  Carnivale  (the customary citywide celebration immediately before Lent, which was rife with various types of immoral behavior).   St. Philip Neri Quotes:   "Men are generally the carpenters of their own crosses."    "Obedience! Humility! Detachment!"    "Let us think of Mary, for she is that unspeakable virgin, that glorious lady, who conceived and brought forth, without detriment      to her virginity, Him whom the width of the heavens cannot contain within itself. "    "To pray well requires the whole man. "

       Feast of St. Charles Borromeo  Today is the feast of  urlLink  St. Charles Borromeo  . Some might think it strange, but this great reformer of the Church, with his reputation for being terribly stern, was a good friend of my own beloved St. Philip Neri, renowned for his gentleness. Their personalities may have contrasted to a certain extent, but each recognized and loved the holiness of Christ shining through in the other.Thus when St. Charles was drawing up his rule for the Oblates of St. Ambrose, it was St. Philip he consulted, and when St. Philip was asked to describe St. Charles. he simply said, "He is radiantly beautiful." For anyone who reads contemporary accounts or looks at  urlLink less   urlLink  idealized  portraits of St. Charles, that comment makes it pretty obvious that St. Philip was seeing his holiness rather than his face.

       A Note on the "From the homily" Posts  I would just like to say that these notes are not often not reflective of all the points, or even the main point, made in any homily on any particular day. They are based on what struck me as memorable from a given homily. Since I don't have a tape recorder with me at Mass, any quotes are as I remember them and may not be completely accurate.  Also, I do ask permission from the priest or deacon before using his homily in a blog. I think it only fair that I should do so.

       A Post That Will Mean Nothing To People Who Aren't Up On The Life of Venerable Newman  While I was volunteering at the front desk of the Oratory yesterday, one of the priests asked me to copy a document. He remarked that "you might want to make a copy for yourself as well." And I certainly did. The document was a copy of the journal Maria (later Sr. Maria Pia) Giberne kept as she traveled to Italy to find witnesses to butress Venerable Newman's case in the Achilli trial. It is not a printed version, but a photocopy of the original, handwritten journal, in Miss Giberne's lovely 19th century script and her sometimes idiosyncratic spelling. (For example, she remarks that one of the witnesses fell and broke her 'ancle'. )   Yes, I know. It's probable most of the few people who read the blog won't have a clue what this is about ("Achilli who ?") , but I still think it's cool, so I'm blogging it anyway.....

       St. Philip Post- Part Four  Answering the Call  Fr. Persanio Rosa, Philip's confessor, was convinced that Philip should become a priest. After much persuasion, Philip finally consented, and he was ordained to the priesthood on May 23, 1551. He was not quite 36 years old, but that was considered a 'very late vocation' by the standards of the time. He lived at San Girolamo as a secular priest, and soon began to attract both many penitents and some followers. There began to be meetings in Philip's room for discussions of the Scriptures and the Lives of the Saints, and also for prayer. Soon the meetings grew too large for the room, and were moved next door. By 1557 a small loft had been built over one of the side aisles of San Girolamo. Philip called the room 'the Oratory', meaning a place of prayer. This could be seen as the beginning of the Congregation of the Oratory, though at the time, and for a long time afterward, Philip had little notion that a community of any kind was being founded at all. Later, he often said that the Blessed Virgin must have founded the Congregation because he did not plan to found anything.   St. Philip Neri Quotes:   "There is nothing more displeasing to God, than our being inflated with self-esteem."    "Let us reflect that the Word left heaven, and stooped to become man for us."    "In the warfare of the flesh, only cowards gain the victory; that is to say, those who run."    "The cheerful are much easier to guide in the spiritual life than the melancholy."

       From the homily  Fr. Drew was preaching today. There were a lot of interesting points in the homily, but the one I remember most was one which concerned the reading from Malachi. He explained that in the verses just preceding the reading, the Lord speaks of the poor, polluted offerings which were being given in sacrifice. "They were giving, not the unblemished lambs and the firstfruits, but the blind sheep, the lame animals, and the leftover grain rotting in their barns. They were giving to God what they would not dare to give an earthly ruler. Yet when we come to worship Him, what are we giving to Him who has given us all ? Too often it's boredom, inattention, and sloth."  Ouch.  Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa  !

       I wondered when this Servant of the White Hand would crawl out of the woodwork...   urlLink  Matthew Fox  is making odd public statements again. Thank God he's no longer doing it as a representative of the Church. The paragraph which really gets me is the last one.   "The bad news is, our institutions are failing us right and left," he concludes. "The good news is: What a moment for creativity. We should let these old institutions die ... and take what's worthwhile and give birth to new institutions that address life with creativity and love."  "Letting the old institutions die"... as if he and his dissenting friends didn't do their very best to poison the Church from within.... The man even dares to use the wonderful words "creativity and love", which properties are the attributes of God, in order to advance his agenda of destruction. "The words of this wizard stand on their heads... In the language of Orthanc help means ruin, and saving means slaying, that is plain. " ("The Voice of Saruman",  The Two Towers , J.R.R. Tolkien)   UPDATE: I should have put in that I found this link courtesy of  urlLink Amy Welborn  . I'm sorry. I was in something of a hurry earlier today.  FURTHER UPDATE: I fixed the link.

        Of the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar        by St. Robert Southwell, S.J. The angels eyes, whom veils cannot deceive, Might best disclose that best they do discern; Men must with sound and silent faith receive More than they can by sense or reason learn; Gods power our proofs, His works our wit exceed, The doers might is reason of His deed.  A body is endued with ghostly rights; And Natures work from Natures law is free; In heavenly sun lie hid eternal lights, Lights clear and near, yet them no eye can see; Dead forms a never-dying life do shroud; A boundless sea lies in a little cloud.  The God of Hosts in slender host doth dwell, Yea, God and man with all to either due, That God that rules the heavens and rifled hell, That man whose death did us to life renew: That God and man that is the angels bliss, In form of bread and wine our nurture is.  Whole may His body be in smallest bread, Whole in the whole, yea whole in every crumb; With which be one or be ten thousand fed, All to each one, to all but one doth come; And though each one as much as all receive, Not one too much, nor all too little have.  One soul in man in all in every part; One face at once in many mirrors shines; One fearful noise doth make a thousand start; One eye at once of countless things defines; If proofs of one in many Nature frame, God may in stranger sort perform the same.  God present is at once in every place, Yet God in every place is ever one; So may there be by gifts of ghostly grace, One man in many rooms, yet filling none; Since angels may effects of bodies shew, God angels gifts on bodies may bestow.

       St. Philip Post- Part Twelve  His Canonization  While the canonization process began incredibly quickly, with the first part starting in August of 1595, the devotion of the people of Rome to "their saint' was not to be held back by the slow movement of an official process. Pictures of "Saint Philip" or "Blessed Philip" were everywhere, and later some said that Philip was canonized 'the old-fashioned way', by popular acclamation rather than by official decree. Nevertheless the official canonization process continued. Hundreds of people came forward to testify about answers to prayer and miracles obtained through Philip's intercession. Finally, on March 12, 1622, Philip Neri, along with Ignatius Loyola, Francis Xavier, Isidore the Farmer, and Teresa of Avila, was declared a saint. The running joke among the folk of Rome was that the Holy Father had canonized "a saint, and four Spaniards." St. Philip Neri was not a man to devise grandiose plans or far reaching schemes for reform. He simply did what he was called to do in the city where God had called him to be. Yet it is arguable that St. Philip, the gentle priest with the kindly words and the sunny sense of humor, was far more successful in reforming Rome than any stern preacher or rigorous legalist could possibly have been. So far reaching was his influence that more than two hundred years after his death, when an Englishman by the name of John Henry Newman, newly come to the Catholic faith and searching for a spiritual home for himself and his followers, asked Pope Pius IX for the name of the holiest priest in Rome, it was St. Philip who came to the Holy Father's mind. St. Philip Neri is known as "the second Apostle of Rome", for as St.Peter (and St. Paul) first established the Faith in that city, St. Philip, through his own great love of God, helped to make the Faith live there again in the hearts of its people. For more information, see the following sources:   St. Philip Neri  - Fr. V.J. Matthews, C.O., TAN Books and Publishers   Apostle of Rome:St. Philip Neri 1515-1595  - Meriol Trevor, Macmillan   Philip Neri: The Fire of Joy  - Fr. Paul Türks, C.O., Alba House   St. Philip Neri Quotes: "The great thing is to become Saints." "What we know of the virtues of the Saints is the least part of them." "Never say, 'What great things the Saints do', but 'What great things God does in His Saints.' " "Paradise, paradise ! "

       Odd little idea....  The amazing  urlLink Mark Shea   began to use the Tolkienean term 'servants of the Lidless Eye" for the Radtrad crowd. Today I was letting my mind wander while I rode the bus, and I began to ponder: what term could we use for the other crowd... the relativist, new morality folks ? Bits from a particular speech jumped into my head: 'The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning... our time is at hand...But we must have power, power to order all things as we will, for that good which only the Wise can see.... We can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring maybe evils done by the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose...There need not be, there would not be, any real change in our designs, only in our means.' ('The Council of Elrond',  The Fellowship of the Ring ) These are the words of the traitorious Wizard, Saruman, saying, in more modern terms, that fighting evil is hopeless and we need to compromise with it, that new times call for a new morality, that maybe evil things will happen but they aren't really evil as long as we finally reach our goal. In other words, what is known now as 'relativism'.  Therefore I am proposing 'the servants of the White Hand' as a Tolkienian descriptive for the Call to Action folks and such. Does that sound too weird ? It makes sense to me, but I haven't got a clue whether anybody else will get it. Ah, well, I'll toss it out here anyhow. What's a blog for if not to throw out odd ideas sometimes ?

       St. Philip Post- Part Eleven  The Last Years  By the time he was an elderly man, Philip's reputation for sanctity had spread far and wide, despite the opposition he had faced at times and his endeavoring to keep his sanctity hidden by his sense of humor. High-ranking officials in the Vatican continued to go to the famous priest for Confession or advice. Attempts were made to give Philip various posts, from important canonries to a cardinal's hat, but he refused all of them. Philip had never had much interest in grand schemes or church politics. For him, day-to-day ministry was what was most important. Even in his last years, when he was often ill, he could still be seen walking the streets of Rome, encouraging people to holiness in their daily lives.   May 25, 1595, the Feast of Corpus Christi, seemed to be a typical day for the now aged priest, filled with many confessions, Mass, and many, many visitors. Several people who visited actually commented on how well Philip looked; yet he made several remarks that indicated that he would die very soon. In the early hours of the morning, May 26, 1595, Philip Neri, who had turned hundreds of people in all walks of life to God, went to his reward, surrounded by the community he loved.   After his death, Philip was laid out in his priestly vestments in the  Chiesa Nuova . The funeral filled the church to overflowing, as a huge crowd, many of them people Philip had helped in various ways, tried to get in. The flowers around the body disappeared as people took them as relics. They were replaced, but soon the replacementswere gone as well. That evening, an autopsy was performed on Philip's body. The doctors found that the ribs over his heart had been bent back, as if they had been broken. This seems to have been fortunate, in that Philip's heart was found to be far larger than the norm, with the arteries from it about twice the normal size. The heart was so large that the doctors determined that if the ribs had been in place, Philip's heart would have been damaged when it beat against them.   The next day, Philip's body once again lay in the  Chiesa Nuova . The church was filled with constant streams of people all day. In the evening, Philip was to have beenburied in a simple wooden coffin in the crypt of the  Chiesa Nuova . However, many people, including several cardinals, objected to this, expecting a quick canonization. The coffin was instead placed over the first arch in the nave of the church. A special chapel was built for it to the left of the high altar, and this is where Philip's body has rested until this day.   St. Philip Neri Quotes: "We must not be behind the time for doing good, for death will not be behind his time." "In visiting the dying, we should not say many words to them, but rather help them by praying for them." "We must die at last." "Human language cannot express the beauty of a soul which dies in a state of grace."

       Feast of St. Martin of Tours  Here is a  urlLink link  to information on him. I am blogging on him not only because he is the patron of the  urlLink parish  where I was baptized and received my First Holy Communion, but also because a particular tale about him is one of my favorite saint stories.  Martin was alone at prayer one day, when suddenly he saw a brilliant light. Standing before him was a young man, shining with what seemed to be the glory of Heaven. The man stated, "Martin, I am Jesus Christ, come back to judge the world, and it has been my good pleasure to appear to you just before I do so." Martin asked. "Sir, may I see your hands and feet ?" The man extended his brilliant hands. Martin, puzzled, asked, "Sir, where are the holes ?"   And the figure disappeared, leaving the room freezing cold and filled with a hideous stench.  ( I believe I first came across this in a book by Fr. George Rutler, but if so, it was years ago, and any inaccuracies are mine.)

       By Venerable John Henry Cardinal Newman, C.O.   Holy Communion 1. My God, who can be inhabited by Thee, except the pure and holy? Sinners may come to Thee, but to whom shouldst Thou come except to the sanctified? My God, I adore Thee as the Holiest; and, when Thou didst come upon earth, Thou didst prepare a holy habitation for Thyself in the most chaste womb of the Blessed Virgin. Thou didst make a dwelling place special for Thyself. She did not receive Thee without first being prepared for Thee; for from the moment that she was at all, she was filled with Thy grace, so that she never knew sin. And so she went on increasing in grace and merit year after year, till the time came, when Thou didst send down the Archangel to signify to her Thy presence within her. So holy must be the dwelling place of the Highest. I adore and glorify Thee, O Lord my God, for Thy great holiness.   2. O my God, holiness becometh Thy House, and yet Thou dost make Thy abode in my breast. My Lord, my Saviour, to me Thou comest, hidden under the semblance of earthly things, yet in that very flesh and blood which Thou didst take from Mary. Thou, who didst first inhabit Mary's breast, dost come to me. My God, Thou seest me; I cannot see myself. Were I ever so good a judge about myself, ever so unbiassed, and with ever so correct a rule of judging, still, from my very nature, I cannot look at myself, and view myself truly and wholly. But Thou, as Thou comest to me, contemplatest me. When I say,  Domine, non sum dignus "Lord, I am not worthy"Thou whom I am addressing, alone understandest in their fulness the words which I use. Thou seest how unworthy so great a sinner is to receive the One Holy God, whom the Seraphim adore with trembling. Thou seest, not only the stains and scars of past sins, but the mutilations, the deep cavities, the chronic disorders which they have left in my soul. Thou seest the innumerable living sins, though they be not mortal, living in their power and presence, their guilt, and their penalties, which clothe me. Thou seest all my bad habits, all my mean principles, all wayward lawless thoughts, my multitude of infirmities and miseries, yet Thou comest. Thou seest most perfectly how little I really feel what I am now saying, yet Thou comest. O my God, left to myself should I not perish under the awful splendour and the consuming fire of Thy Majesty. Enable me to bear Thee, lest I have to say with Peter, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!"   3. My God, enable me to bear Thee, for Thou alone canst. Cleanse my heart and mind from all that is past. Wipe out clean all my recollections of evil. Rid me from all languor, sickliness, irritability, feebleness of soul. Give me a true perception of things unseen, and make me truly, practically, and in the details of life, prefer Thee to anything on earth, and the future world to the present. Give me courage, a true instinct determining between right and wrong, humility in all things, and a tender longing love of Thee.

       On Pro-Life Voting  I'd like to reiterate some things I said in my "One Hundred Things About Me" posts.  "12. I absolutely, positively WILL NOT vote for anybody who supports the 'right' to dismember babies. 13. I have voted third party in the past when no pro-life candidate was on a major party ticket. 14. I have skipped voting in a particular race when no pro-life candidate was available at all." Part of my reasoning is simple. People who support abortion on demand are for legalized slaughter of utterly innocent children. I would no more trust such a person with public office than I would trust a Nazi. Their very position on this issue makes their character, and thus their fitness for public office, so dubious in my eyes that I couldn't possibly make myself vote for them. I'm not claiming that this is the official teaching of the Church, or that people for whom other issues matter more than they do for me are completely off base. It's just that  I  cannot in good conscience vote for someone who favors abortion. I know that makes it easy for me to be accused of being simplistic, one-issue, or what have you, but it's where I draw the line. ( I include support for legalized euthanasia as well as abortion. Again, it's a disqualifying issue for me.)

       St. Philip Post- Part Ten  Expansion to Naples  An important step was taken in 1584. One of the most noted of the Oratorians, Francesco Tarugi, was sent to on a trip to Naples for his health. While he was there, he preached as he had done at the Oratory. This preaching was so successful that various Neapolitans asked that more Oratorians be sent to them and a new Oratorian house founded. While Tarugi and others were enthusiastic, seeing this as a way of spreading the work of the Oratory, and even envisioning many other foundations to follow, Philip was hesitant. The Oratory in Rome itself was still a very young community. Dividing their strength so soon after the original foundation seemed to be risky, and Philip thought it unwise. On the other hand, Philip did not want to stand in the way if God wished a new foundation to be made. The majority was in favor of a new foundation in Naples, so it was established in 1586.  The relationship between the Roman Oratory and the Naples Oratory was to be somewhat stormy. The Naples house began introducing changes in its Rule, which would make the Oratory more like a religious Order than Philip desired, such as an enclosed novitiate and more emphasis on a tightly structured communal life. The change Philip objected to the most was making the members renounce their property and hold all things in common. So strong was his objection that when the Rule was finally codified, it included, at his insistence, a clause absolutely forbidding an Oratory to demand renunciation of property. Both houses weathered the storms, and Naples is now the second oldest Oratorian community in existence.   St. Philip Neri Quotes: "The most beautiful prayer we can make, is to say to God, 'As Thou knowest and willest, O Lord, so do with me.' " "Do not let a day pass without doing some good during it." "We must avoid lies as we would a pestilence." "One of the very best means of obtaining humility, is sincere and frequent confession."

       Tommorow is the Feast of Christ the King   The Kingdom of God- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  1. MY Lord Jesus, how wonderful were those conversations which Thou didst hold from time to time with Thy disciples after Thy resurrection. When Thou wentest with two of them to Emmaus, Thou didst explain all the prophecies which related to Thyself. And Thou didst commit to the Apostles the Sacraments in fulness, and the truths which it was Thy will to reveal, and the principles and maxims by which Thy Church was to be maintained and governed. And thus Thou didst prepare them against the day of Pentecost (as the risen bodies were put into shape for the Spirit in the Prophet's Vision), when life and illumination was to be infused into them. I will think over all Thou didst say to them with a true and simple faith. The "kingdom of God" was Thy sacred subject. Let me never for an instant forget that Thou hast established on earth a kingdom of Thy own, that the Church is Thy work, Thy establishment, Thy instrument; that we are under Thy rule, Thy laws and Thy eyethat when the Church speaks Thou dost speak. Let not familiarity with this wonderful truth lead me to be insensible to itlet not the weakness of Thy human representatives lead me to forget that it is Thou who dost speak and act through them. It was just when Thou wast going away, that then Thou didst leave this kingdom of Thine to take Thy place on to the end of the world, to speak for Thee, as Thy visible form, when Thy Personal Presence, sensible to man, was departing. I will in true loving faith bring Thee before me, teaching all the truths and laws of this kingdom to Thy Apostles, and I will adore Thee, while in my thoughts I gaze upon Thee and listen to Thy words.  2. Come, O my dear Lord, and teach me in like manner. I need it not, and do not ask it, as far as this, that the word of truth which in the beginning was given to the Apostles by Thee, has been handed down from age to age, and has already been taught to me, and Thy Infallible Church is the warrant of it. But I need Thee to teach me day by day, according to each day's opportunities and needs. I need Thee to give me that true Divine instinct about revealed matters that, knowing one part, I may be able to anticipate or to approve of others. I need that understanding of the truths about Thyself which may prepare me for all Thy other truthsor at least may save me from conjecturing wrongly about them or commenting falsely upon them. I need the mind of the Spirit, which is the mind of the holy Fathers, and of the Church by which I may not only say what they say on definite points, but think what they think; in all I need to be saved from an originality of thought, which is not true if it leads away from Thee. Give me the gift of discriminating between true and false in all discourse of mind.  3. And, for that end, give me, O my Lord, that purity of conscience which alone can receive, which alone can improve Thy inspirations. My ears are dull, so that I cannot hear Thy voice. My eyes are dim, so that I cannot see Thy tokens. Thou alone canst quicken my hearing, and purge my sight, and cleanse and renew my heart. Teach me, like Mary, to sit at Thy feet, and to hear Thy word. Give me that true wisdom, which seeks Thy will by prayer and meditation, by direct intercourse with Thee, more than by reading and reasoning. Give me the discernment to know Thy voice from the voice of strangers, and to rest upon it and to seek it in the first place, as something external to myself; and answer me through my own mind, if I worship and rely on Thee as above and beyond it. - From "Meditations on Christian Doctrine",  Meditations and Devotions

       The building where I usually attend Mass  It has its drawbacks, most of them stemming from the fact that it belongs to the University of Pittsburgh and therefore is missing certain features a Catholic church would (or at least should) have: i.e there's no kneelers, which makes it tough on the knees, and the Blessed Sacrament cannot be reserved there. We have to bring in a crucifix and a statue of Our Lady, and the incredible stained glass windows have some folks in them I'd rather not see.  However, I still think it's lovely.  urlLink Heinz Memorial Chapel

       Jeff Miller is cool.  When I posted a link to  urlLink this picture  and asked what could possess someone to build a church which looks like that, he sent me some great comments.  "I think that your word"possessed" is aptly chosen.  It used to be churches made you think of heaven and not hell." "That church is also an example of what happens when a young architect is deprived of Legos."  Mr. Miller has a wonderful blog, which can be found  urlLink here , as well as on a link on the sidebar of this blog.

       From the homily  Fr. David celebrated the noon Mass. His homily was short, since he is a bit ill and his voice isn't up to par. (Prayers would, of course, be appreciated.) The point that stuck me the most was when he said that  we , in our souls and our bodies, are temples of the Lord, through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and most especially when we receive the Lord in the Eucharist. "How often do we profane these temples by putting the things the world values ahead of Christ ?"

       Tommorow's feast  is the Feast of  urlLink  St. Cecilia  . As a choir member, I really should blog on the patroness of musicians, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to blog tommorow.   Here's a poem for the feast. The last part in particular is one of my favorite bits of verse.       A SONG FOR ST. CECILIA'S DAY, 1687         JOHN DRYDEN (1631-1700)     From harmony, from Heav'nly harmony          This universal frame began.        When Nature underneath a heap              Of jarring atoms lay,        And could not heave her head,    The tuneful voice was heard from high,               Arise ye more than dead.     Then cold, and hot, and moist, and dry,         In order to their stations leap,             And music's pow'r obey.      From harmony, from Heav'nly harmony             This universal frame began:             From harmony to harmony     Through all the compass of the notes it ran,         The diapason closing full in man.         What passion cannot music raise and quell!             When Jubal struck the corded shell,         His list'ning brethren stood around          And wond'ring, on their faces fell        To worship that celestial sound:   Less than a god they thought there could not dwell            Within the hollow of that shell         That spoke so sweetly and so well.    What passion cannot music raise and quell!         The trumpet's loud clangor             Excites us to arms         With shrill notes of anger             And mortal alarms.       The double double double beat           Of the thund'ring drum        Cries, hark the foes come;    Charge, charge, 'tis too late to retreat.          The soft complaining flute         In dying notes discovers         The woes of hopeless lovers,     Whose dirge is whisper'd by the warbling lute.          Sharp violins proclaim        Their jealous pangs, and desperation,        Fury, frantic indignation,       Depth of pains and height of passion,       For the fair, disdainful dame.          But oh! what art can teach       What human voice can reach        The sacred organ's praise?        Notes inspiring holy love,       Notes that wing their Heav'nly ways       To mend the choirs above.         Orpheus could lead the savage race;       And trees unrooted left their place;           Sequacious of the lyre:      But bright Cecilia rais'd the wonder high'r;      When to her organ, vocal breath was giv'n,      An angel heard, and straight appear'd          Mistaking earth for Heav'n.         As from the pow'r of sacred lays       The spheres began to move,       And sung the great Creator's praise       To all the bless'd above;      So when the last and dreadful hour        This crumbling pageant shall devour,      The trumpet shall be heard on high,       The dead shall live, the living die,       And music shall untune the sky.

       Feast of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary   "In Jesus Christ is the fulness of the Godhead with all its infinite sanctity. In Mary is reflected the sanctity of Jesus, as by His grace it could be found in a creature. Mary, as the pattern both of maidenhood and maternity, has exalted womans state and nature, and made the Christian virgin and the Christian mother understand the sacredness of their duties in the sight of God. Her very image is as a book in which we may read at a glance the mystery of the Incarnation, and the mercy of the Redemption; and withal her own gracious perfections also, who was made by her Divine Son the very type of humility, gentleness, fortitude, purity, patience, love. What Christian mother can look upon her image and not be moved to pray for gentleness, watchfulness, and obedience like Marys? What Christian maiden can look upon her without praying for the gifts of simplicity, modesty, purity, recollection, gentleness such as hers? Who can repeat her very name without finding in it a music which goes to the heart, and brings before him thoughts of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven above, and fills him with the desire of those graces by which heaven is gained? Hail then, great Mother of God, Queen of Saints, Royal Lady clothed with the sun and crowned with the stars of heaven, whom all generations have called and shall call blessed. We will take our part in praising thee in our own time and place with all the redeemed of our Lord, and will exalt thee in the full assembly of the saints and glorify thee in the Heavenly Jerusalem." - From "A Short Service for Rosary Sunday" by Venerable John Henry Newman C.O.

       From the homily  Fr. Joseph was the celebrant at noon Mass today. He had a lot of interesting points in his homily. One point dealt with one of the ways in which today's Gospel reading from St. Luke differs from the parallel text in St. Matthew which we heard on Sunday. It has a setting the other lacks, in that Our Lord is said to be "going to Jerusalem" as He teaches this particular parable, and St. Luke's account of the first Palm Sunday follows it immediately. Just as the other citizens in the parable protest that they do not want the nobleman to be their King, so the people of Jerusalem, egged on by the chief priests and elders, will turn against the Son of God and reject His Kingship. "They chose Caesar over Christ the King."  How often we are tempted to do this ourselves !

       This brings back memories...  Gregg the Obscure posts about  urlLink  a dog showing up during Mass.  Back when I was in college, the Catholic campus ministry had to celebrate several of the Sunday Masses in an auditorium, since the secular university's chapel was far too small for the number of people who would come on Sunday. Apparently, one of the professors was often in the building on Sundays, because his dog, a huge black Standard Poodle named Balzac, would turn up outside the auditorium door after Mass Sunday after Sunday, trying to cadge doughnuts from people. He was usually thwarted though, since his owner had attached a cardboard sign to his collar which read, "Hi ! My name is Balzac, and I'm a bit silly. Please do not feed me, since I will overeat and then get sick."  Balzac came to Mass occasionally, but unlike the Golden Retriever in this above post, he didn't saunter down the nave, since there was no nave. He either paced back and forth just inside the door or barrelled down the auditorium steps like a curly-haired freight train,either of which was distracting, to say the least. One of the students would have to tug on his collar a bit and get him to go back outside until Mass was over. Fortunately, this did not happen often.  This was over ten years ago, and doubtless Balzac has since gone wherever good, if sometimes goofy, dogs go. I hope his end was kind. He was a sweetheart, if a bit overenthusiastic about food !

       The Pittsburgh Oratory  Well, I blogged on the life of the founder of the Congregation of the Oratory, St. Philip Neri. However, I am a Secular Oratorian at a particular Oratory..the Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Pittsburgh. I'm going to blog on the history of this particular community, by posting an article which, in revised form, may be on the still-being-constructed new Pittsburgh Oratory website. (Don't worry. It's a  lot  shorter than the St. Philip Neri article !)    The Pittsburgh Oratory   While the history of the Congregation of the Oratory goes back more than 400 years, and the history of the Oratory in the English-speaking world began almost 150 years ago, the history of the Congregation of the Oratory in Pittsburgh begins less than 50 years ago. This makes it a young Congregation, but by no means the youngest, as about 20 Oratories have been founded more recently than Pittsburgh, and there are more communities in formation.    The Beginning   It began with John Wright, then the Bishop of Pittsburgh, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. (He later became John Cardinal Wright, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of the Clergy.) He was aware that many Catholic students were attending secular colleges, where their faith was sure to be challenged. The bishop also realized that while there were already Newman Clubs on Pittsburgh campuses, it would be a great help to students to have an actual community of priests, which would minister to the students.   Bishop Wright was familiar with the writings of John Henry Cardinal Newman (now Venerable), who had written so eloquently on education, and thus had been taken as the patron of Catholic campus ministry. Putting together the need for ministry and his knowledge of Newman, he came up with an idea: why not have a Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri, Newmans own community, in Pittsburgh, with its members working as chaplains to the students of secular universities?  This would be especially helpful because Oratorians would stay in one place for life, giving the ministry a measure of stability, which would be particularly needed by college communities, which are transient, by their very nature.  This was not an entirely new idea. Newman himself had, at one point, hoped, and even taken steps to begin an Oratory at Oxford. However, this had not come about, due to opposition to such a measure by various people in the hierarchy. Pittsburgh was not Oxford, but now followers of St. Philip would be serving Catholic students at secular universities, as Newman himself had dreamed so long ago. (Oxford now has an Oratory as well, which was established in 1993.)    Formation   Bishop Wright was a man of great vision; however he knew that having an idea is quite different from implementing an idea. Much labor was needed to make his vision a reality. Bishop Wright contacted the Rock Hill Oratory in South Carolina for help in getting this fledgling community started. He was also in communication with the Birmingham Oratory in England, Newmans own community, and they were also most helpful, sending one of their priests to assist the new foundation for six months.   By 1961, a community was established at 4040 Bigelow Boulevard, in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh, close to three of the secular universities in Pittsburgh: the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Chatham College.  When all of the formation was completed, and the requirements for a fully established Oratory met, the Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Pittsburgh was canonically erected April 15, 1968. In the years to come, the apostolate to students continued to grow and thrive, and as hoped by the founders, the Oratory provided stability and strength to students trying to live their faith in troubled times.   Rednal   During this time, the Oratory acquired a large farmhouse in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, along with about 90 acres of the surrounding countryside, to be a retreat house for the Oratorians and their ministry. This house was named Rednal, after the retreat house of the Birmingham Oratory, as a tribute to the community that had played an important part in the formation of the Pittsburgh Oratory. Through the years, the house has been enlarged and improved a great deal, but its purpose has remained constant: to give those who visit there the ability to build up their faith in a quiet and beautiful setting, in a respite from the hectic life of the urban university campuses.       Building and Growth    In 1994, the Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Pittsburgh moved to its current location, at 4450 Bayard Street. This building, unlike the communitys previous home, had been built specifically for the Oratory and its ministry, with funds raised by the Oratory itself. The new building, which has more spacious facilities for the ministry to students, also includes room for the housing of new members. If it be Gods will, the Congregation of the Oratory in Pittsburgh will continue its ministries, in the spirit of St. Philip, serving and strengthening the life of faith in the university communities in this new millennium.

C.O. - I know, he's not canonized yet. I'm including him anyway.    I could list many, many more saints, but these five are particularly close to my heart. This was made particularly obvious to me when  urlLink an ill-considered attack on Number 4.   was made by a man who claims to be a follower of Number 5.

       A Prayer for the Servants of the White Hand...   Jesus the Author and Finisher of Faith -Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "St. Paul tells us to "look on Jesus, the Author and Finisher of faith." Faith is the first step towards salvation, and without it we have no hope. For St. Paul says, "Without faith it is impossible to please God." It is a divine light; by it we are brought out of darkness into sunshine; by it, instead of groping, we are able to see our way towards heaven. Moreover, it is a great gift, which comes from above, and which we cannot obtain except from Him who is the object of it. He, our Lord Jesus Himself, and He alone, gives us the grace to believe in Him. Hence the Holy Apostle calls Him the author of our faithand He finishes and perfects it alsofrom first to last it is altogether from Him. Therefore it was that our Lord said, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth" (Mark ix. 22-23). And hence the poor man to whom He spoke, who believed indeed already, but still feebly, made answer"crying out with tears, I do believe, Lord; help Thou my unbelief." Hence, too, on another occasion, the Apostles said to our Lord, "Increase our faith" (Luke xvii. 5). And St. Paul draws out fully the whole matter when he reminds his converts, "And you (hath He raised), when you were dead in your offences and sins, wherein in time past you walked, according to the course of this world, ... in {183} which we all conversed in time past, ... and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; but God (who is rich in mercy), for His exceeding charity wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together in Christ ... By grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God" (Ephesians ii. 1-8).   Let us pray for all the scorners, scoffers, and unbelievers, all false teachers and opposers of the truth, who are to be found in this land.   O Lord Jesus Christ, upon the Cross Thou didst say: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." And this surely, O my God, is the condition of vast multitudes among us now; they know not what they might have known, or they have forgotten what once they knew. They deny that there is a God, but they know not what they are doing. They laugh at the joys of heaven and the pains of hell, but they know not what they are doing. They renounce all faith in Thee, the Saviour of man, they despise Thy Word and Sacraments, they revile and slander Thy Holy Church and her Priests, but they know not what they are doing. They mislead the wandering, they frighten the weak, they corrupt the young, but they know not what they do. Others, again, have a wish to be religious, but mistake error for truththey go after fancies of their own, and they seduce others and keep them from Thee. They know not what they are doing, but Thou canst make them know. O Lord, we urge Thee by Thy own dear words, "Lord and Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." Teach them now, open their eyes here, before the future comes; give them faith in what they must see hereafter, if they will not believe in it here. Give them full and saving faith here; destroy their dreadful delusions, and give them to drink of that living water, which whoso hath shall not thirst again."

       Carl Olsen's take on a annoying  Time   article   is  urlLink  great . Of course the modernist types have been doing that to Tolkien since 1954. I take the fact that the movies are getting this type of reaction as a positive sign. It means they may actually be reflecting the book properly !  What's really funny is the typical way the  Time  writer assumes that if one believes in good and evil, one is therefore a simpleton who sees people as immutably good or bad.

       Just because  God's Ways not Our Ways - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Quia hæc locutus sum vobis, tristitia implevit cor vestrum. Sed ego veritatem dico vobis. Expedit vobis.  Because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart. But I tell you the truth: it is expedient for you.  1. O MY Saviour, I adore Thee for Thy infinite wisdom, which sees what we do not see, and orderest all things in its own most perfect way. When Thou didst say to the Apostles that Thou wast going away, they cried out, as if Thou hadst, if it may be so said, broken faith with them. They seemed to say to Thee, "O Jesu, did we not leave all things for Thee? Did we not give up home and family, father and wife, friends and neighbours, our habits, our accustomed way of living, that we might join Thee? Did we not divorce ourselves from the world, or rather die to it, that we might be eternally united and live to Thee? And now Thou sayest that Thou art leaving us. Is this reasonable? is this just? is this faithfulness to Thy promise? Did we bargain for this? O Lord Jesus, we adore Thee, but we are confounded, and we know not what to say!"  2. Yet let God be true, and every man a liar. Let the Divine Word triumph in our minds over every argument and persuasion of sensible appearances. Let faith rule us and not sight. Thou art justified, O Lord, when Thou art arraigned, and dost gain the cause when Thou art judged. For Thou didst know that the true way of possessing Thee was to lose Thee. Thou didst know that what man stands most of all in need of, and in the first place, is not an outward guide, though that he needs too, but an inward, intimate, invisible aid. Thou didst intend to heal him thoroughly, not slightly; not merely to reform the surface, but to remove and destroy the heart and root of all his ills. Thou then didst purpose to visit his soul, and Thou didst depart in body, that Thou mightest come again to him in spirit. Thou didst not stay with Thy Apostles therefore, as in the days of Thy flesh, but Thou didst come to them and abide with them for ever, with a much more immediate and true communion in the power of the Paraclete.  3. O my God, in Thy sight, I confess and bewail my extreme weakness, in distrusting, if not Thee, at least Thy own servants and representatives, when things do not turn out as I would have them, or expected! Thou hast given me St. Philip, that great creation of Thy grace, for my master and patronand I have committed myself to himand he has done very great things for me, and has in many ways fulfilled towards me all that I can fairly reckon he had promised. But, because in some things he has disappointed me, and delayed, I have got impatient; and have served him, though without conscious disloyalty, yet with peevishness and coldness. O my dear Lord, give me a generous faith in Thee and in Thy servants!

       Thanks, Father !   urlLink  Fr. James Tucker  was kind enough to mention, and post a link to, my blog. He mentions the Oratorian aspect of the blog, and the rat aspect. He seems to have missed the Tolkien part, unless he's including that with the Oratorian aspect because of the Professor's Oratorian connections. As for the rat links and such, that's just me. While I am currently  ratless, I have great affection for the little furballs and intend to get more when circumstances allow. Actually, a love of animals is a very Philippian trait.  "He was very tender towards brute animals. Seeing someone put his foot on a lizard, he cried out, "Cruel fellow! what has that poor animal done to you?"  Seeing a butcher wound a dog with one of his knives, he could not contain himself, and had great difficulty in keeping himself cool. He could not bear the slightest cruelty to be shown to brute animals under any pretext whatever. If a bird came into the room, he would have the window opened that it might not be caught."-  Novena of St. Philip - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

       Vespers for Friday  Translated by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  Hominis superne Conditor.               WHOM all obey,  Maker of man! who from Thy height  Badest the dull earth bring to light  All creeping things, and the fierce might             Of beasts of prey;              And the huge make  Of wild or gentler animal,  Springing from nothing at Thy call,  To serve in their due time, and all             For sinners' sake;              Shield us from ill!  Come it by passion's sudden stress,  Lurk in our mind's habitual dress,  Or through our actions seek to press             Upon our will.              Vouchsafe the prize  Of sacred joy's perpetual mood,  And service-seeking gratitude,  And love to quell each strife or feud,             If it arise.              Grant it, O Lord!  To whom, the Father, Only Son,  And Holy Spirit, Three in One,  In heaven and earth all praise be done,             With one accord.

       'Tis the season  for Tolkien articles... at least this year, and next year. This one at  urlLink WSJ.com  isn't bad. However, exactly where does he get the idea of Fr. Morgan as a 'severe priest' ? True, he was rather hard on Tolkien's adolescent romance with Edith, but, considering both the times and the circumstances, this is somewhat understandable. A quote from the website of Fr. Morgan's community gives a more accurate picture of the man the dying Mabel Tolkien chose to be the guardian of her two sons:  " In the Anglo-Spanish/Welsh Francis Morgan, Mabel found a priest with no intellectual finesse but ebullience, pastoral solicitude, and deep generosity."

       St. Nicholas of Myra  It's his feast day, so here's a link to information on   urlLink  the real deal  who has been slowly distorted into Santa Claus. (In the homily today, Fr. Drew noted that it's a bit ironic that, given the current image of Santa with his bag of toys, our Gospel today for the feast of St. Nicholas included the verse, "Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals; and greet no one along the way." )

         Christmas Music  Advent is here, which means our choir is going to start rehearsing Christmas music soon. One of the choir pieces we almost always sing at Christmas, but which nobody with any ear at all could possible tire of, is  O Magnum Mysterium  by Vittoria. There's a link  urlLink  here , as well as the same link on the left under "Sound files".   However, one of my favorites is this hymn,  which for some reason doesn't seem to be as popular in most parishes, but which we sing every year.    Of the Fathers love begotten, ere the worlds began to be, He is Alpha and Omega, He the source, the ending He, Of the things that are, that have been, And that future years shall see, evermore and evermore!  O that birth forever blessèd, when the virgin, full of grace, By the Holy Ghost conceiving, bore the Savior of our race; And the Babe, the worlds Redeemer, First revealed His sacred face, evermore and evermore!  O ye heights of heaven adore Him; angel hosts, His praises sing; Powers, dominions, bow before Him, and extol our God and King! Let no tongue on earth be silent, Every voice in concert ring, evermore and evermore!  Christ, to Thee with God the Father, and, O Holy Ghost, to Thee, Hymn and chant with high thanksgiving, and unwearied praises be: Honor, glory, and dominion, And eternal victory, evermore and evermore!

       Sickening !  I know. Compared with the horrific death toll of unborn children every day,  urlLink  this   is relatively unimportant. But it's still repulsive. Of course, as someone who has owned several rats, who has played with them, cuddled with them, enjoyed their antics, wept over their deaths, and even watched  a litter of them grow up, I can hardly be objective. (I'm sitting here trying to keep myself from crying.) I doubt it's going to get much in the way of publicity, though. (Now if it were, say, puppies, all sorts of folks would be up in arms.)  urlLink Mr. Lams  posted the link.

       Since it's his name day..  I'd like to mention the late Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan  of the  urlLink  Birmingham Oratory  . (There's no direct link, so to find the article on Fr. Morgan and his ward, J.R.R. Tolkien, click on "Community", then on "Deceased Members", and then on Fr. Morgan's name.) I don't entirely agree with the article's points ( e.g "Rivendell=Rednal", IMHO, is a stretch), and I became a Tolkien fan long before I met any Oratorians. However, the connection between the Professor and our community is just too cool not to note.  Here's two quotes from a letter written late in the Professor's life. "And again, I remember after the death of Fr. Francis my 'second father' (at 77, in 1935), saying to C.S. Lewis, ' I feel like a lost survivor in a new alien world after the real world has passed away.' " "In 1904 we (Hilary (ed. Tolkien's brother) & I) had the sudden miraculous experience of Fr. Francis' love and care and humour..."

       St. Francis Xavier, S.J.   It's his feast day today. There's information on him  urlLink  here  .  It's not absolutely verifiable, but he is quite probable that he knew St. Philip Neri. It is certain that St. Philip and  urlLink  St. Ignatius Loyola  were friends. It is also true that all three of them,along with urlLink  St. Teresa of Avila  and  urlLink  St. Isidore the Farmer , were canonized at the same ceremony on March 22, 1622.   Dear Lord, if a tenth of the Catholics in the world could but have the zeal of that magnificent quintet, what could we not accomplish for the love of God and His Kingdom ?

       In which the Venerable explains things a lot better than I do    St. Philip in his School - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  (A Song)   THIS is the Saint of gentleness and kindness,  Cheerful in penance, and in precept winning;  Patiently healing of their pride and blindness,  Souls that are sinning.   This is the Saint, who, when the world allures us,  Cries her false wares, and opes her magic coffers,  Points to a better city, and secures us  With richer offers.   Love is his bond, he knows no other fetter,  Asks not our all, but takes whate'er we spare him,  Willing to draw us on from good to better,  As we can bear him.   When he comes near to teach us and to bless us,  Prayer is so sweet, that hours are but a minute;  Mirth is so pure, though freely it possess us,  Sin is not in it.   Thus he conducts by holy paths and pleasant,  Innocent souls, and sinful souls forgiven,  Towards the bright palace where our God is present,  Throned in high heaven

       Some Oratorian information (with emphasis on official stuff)   In  The Catechism of the Catholic Church , there is a mention of the category of religious community which includes Congregations of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri. 930. "Alongside the different forms of consecrated life are societies of apostolic life whose members without religious vows pursue the particular apostolic purpose of their society, and lead a life as brothers or sisters in common according to a particular manner of life, strive for the perfection of charity through the observance of the constitutions. Among these there are societies in which the members embrace the evangelical counsels' according to their constitutions.[Cf. CIC, can. 731 ## 1 and 2.]" (  Catechism of the Catholic Church  )   The Congregations of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri fit into this category. Each Oratory is a community of priests, and in some cases brothers, who live in community but do not take vows. The ones who are priests make promises of celibacy and obedience as diocesan priests do. However, the obedience is promised not to the local bishop, but to the Oratorian's "ordinary", which is the Provost of the community. ( I know. I've been to several ordinations of Oratorian priests. The Bishop asks "Do you promise respect and obedience to your Ordinary ?" )   There are somewhere between 600 and 700 Oratorians proper in the world, in 75 Congregations present in Europe, Latin America, North America, and Africa. The representation is somewhat lopsided in that 51 of the 75 are in Europe, with 17 of those in Italy. There are currently seven Congregations in the United States. Though there is a Confederation, each Congregation is self-governing under the General Constitutions, and each house tends to develop its own customs to a certain extent.   When a man joins an Oratory, it is, if all goes well, for life. There are usually no transfers between Congregations. One could say that men do not have vocations to belong to "the Oratorians", but that men have vocations to belong to the Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Pittsburgh, or the Congregation in Rome, or Birmingham, England, or Pharr, Texas, or any of the others. (I remember one lady, unfamiliar with the community, asking one of our priests how long he would be assigned here, and she was startled to get the answer "God willing, until I die." )   The Secular Oratorians, of which I am a member, are laity who are, to the best of our abilities, living the charism of the founder outside of the community life of the Oratorians proper. However, like the Oratorians proper, we are also associated with a particular Congregation... the one in Pittsburgh, in my case. One of their priests is our 'Father Prefect' who leads us in prayer at our bi-weekly meetings, and we assist in their apostolates as we can.  We are also known as "the Little Oratory", and this is the name we actually use most ourselves, but I tend to use the term 'Secular Oratory' with those unacquainted with us, since people are often familiar with Secular Franciscans and such, and it's sort of similar. (We're not a 'third order', since Oratorians are not 'order' priests or brothers.)   O.K., that's my blog on the official stuff. I've already blogged on the founder's life and the history of the Pittsburgh Congregation. I'll try to blog more on our spirituality and  apostolate later.

        Hymn for Advent Vespers  Translated by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Creator alme siderum   Creator of the starry pole,  Saviour of all who live,  And light of every faithful soul,  Jesu, these prayers receive.   Who sooner than our foe malign  Should triumph, from above  Didst come, to be the medicine  Of a sick world, in love;   And the deep wounds to cleanse and cure  Of a whole race, didst go,  Pure Victim, from a Virgin pure,  The bitter Cross unto.   Who hast a Name, and hast a Power,  The height and depth to sway,  And Angels bow, and devils cower,  In transport or dismay;   Thou too shalt be our Judge at length;  Lord, in Thy grace bestow  Thy weapons of celestial strength,   And snatch us from the foe.   Honour and glory, power and praise,  To Father, and to Son,  And Holy Ghost, be paid always,  The Eternal Three in One.

       If it weren't the first Sunday of Advent  and if the US calendar observed the feasts of these wonderful martyrs, today would be the feast of  urlLink  St. Edmund Campion  ,  urlLink  St. Alexander Briant  ,   urlLink  St. Nicholas Owen  ,   urlLink  St. Thomas Garnet  ,  urlLink   Blessed John Beche ,    urlLink   Blessed Ralph Ashley ,  and  urlLink   Blessed Richard Langley . All of these have today as their feast, though the canonized ones are included in the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales are honored with that group on October 25.  In honor of this almost-feast day, here is an excerpt from the magnificent biography  Edmund Campion , by Evelyn Waugh. This is the statement of St. Edmund Campion, upon being declared guilty of the 'treason' of being a Catholic priest.   WARNING ! EXPLICIT DESCRIPTION OF MARTYRDOM INCLUDED.    " 'It was not our death that ever we feared. But we knew that we were not lords of our own lives, and therefore for want of answer would not be guilty of our deaths. The only thing that we have now to say is, that if our religion do make us traitors, we are worthy to be condemned; but otherwise we are, and have been, as good subjects as ever the Queen had.  In condemning us you condemn all your own ancestors-all the ancient priests, bishops and kings-all that once was the glory of England, the island of saints and the most devoted child of the See of Peter. For what have we taught, however you may qualify it with the odious name of treason, that they did not uniformly teach ? To be condemned with these lights-not of England only, but of the world-by their degenerate descendants, is both gladness and glory to us.  God lives; posterity will live; their judgement is not so liable to corruption as that of those who are now going to sentence us to death.'  The Lord Chief Justice answered: ' You must go to the place from whence you came, there to remain until ye shall be drawn upon hurdles to the place of execution, and there be hanged and let down alive, and your privy parts cut off, and your entrails taken out and burnt in your sight; then your heads to be cut off and your bodies divided into four parts, to be disposed of at her Majesty's pleasure. And may God have mercy on your souls.'  As the Lord Chief Justice's final commendation sounded, with peculiar irony, throughout Westminster Hall, the condemned men broke into the words of the  Te Deum  , and were led back in triumph to their several prisons."

       From the homily  Fr. Bryan celebrated the noon Mass today. Among the remarks in the homily was this one. "The vestments for Advent are purple. When you go to your home parishes, you may see blue ones. This is not correct. Blue is not a liturgical color. Some liturgists have said that blue should be used 'because Advent, unlike Lent, is not a season of penance.' However, if you read the prayers for Advent properly, they show that it  is  a season of penance, of preparation for the coming of the Lord, both at the end of time and at Christmas. Penance is a part of keeping watch until He comes. "

       Music at noon Mass  Processional Hymn: "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel" Offertory: "Ad Te Levavi"- Josef Rheinberger (1839-1901) Communion: "Alma Redemptoris Mater" - Giovanni Pierlugi da Palestrina (c.1525 - 1594)  Recessional : "Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence"  It is always especially nice when we sing a Palestrina piece. Not only did the man write amazing music, but he was also a friend (and penitent) of St. Philip Neri, and wrote some music especially for the original Oratorians.

       The Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe  is today. There is a link to information on this feast  urlLink here.  While I doubt that Venerable Newman was ever even aware of this particular feast, I think this little meditation fits it well, since in this apparition Our Lady wore a black sash, which in the culture of pre-Columbian Mexico, indicated a woman who was with child. Thus she showed herself to St. Juan Diego as the one who was housing the Incarnate Lord within her body.....  Mary is the "Domus Aurea," the House of Gold by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  Why is she called a House? And why is she called Golden? Gold is the most beautiful, the most valuable, of all metals. Silver, copper, and steel may in their way be made good to the eye, but nothing is so rich, so splendid, as gold. We have few opportunities of seeing it in any quantity; but anyone who has seen a large number of bright gold coins knows how magnificent is the look of gold. Hence it is that in Scripture the Holy City is, by a figure of speech, called Golden. "The City," says St. John, "was pure gold, as it were transparent glass." He means of course to give us a notion of the wondrous beautifulness of heaven, by comparing it with what is the most beautiful of all the substances which we see on earth.  Therefore it is that Mary too is called golden; because her graces, her virtues, her innocence, her purity, are of that transcendent brilliancy and dazzling perfection, so costly, so exquisite, that the angels cannot, so to say, keep their eyes off her any more than we could help gazing upon any great work of gold.  But observe further, she is a golden house, or, I will rather say, a golden palace. Let us imagine we saw a whole palace or large church all made of gold, from the foundations to the roof; such, in regard to the number, the variety, the extent of her spiritual excellences, is Mary.  But why called a house or palace? And whose palace? She is the house and the palace of the Great King, of God Himself. Our Lord, the Co-equal Son of God, once dwelt in her. He was her Guest; nay, more than a guest, for a guest comes into a house as well as leaves it. But our Lord was actually born in this holy house. He took His flesh and His blood from this house, from the flesh, from the veins of Mary. Rightly then was she made to be of pure gold, because she was to give of that gold to form the body of the Son of God. She was golden in her conception, golden in her birth. She went through the fire of her suffering like gold in the furnace, and when she ascended on high, she was, in the words of our hymn,   Above all the Angels in glory untold, Standing next to the King in a vesture of gold.

Since this will be the commemoration of the Professor's  eleventy-first  birthday, various people are planning parties of special magnificence. However, I've taken a slightly different tack. If anybody happens to be in Pittsburgh that day, the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass will be offered for the Professor's soul beginning at 5:15 pm at the Pittsburgh Oratory. if you can't make it, remember to at least give him a moment of prayer.

       Interesting link   urlLink  Mr. Chris Burgwald  has a  urlLink link  to an article on one of the few TV shows I actually watch on a regular basis.  Monk  really is a good show, though certain episodes have been less good than others. ( The one with Mr. Nelson was weak, IMHO, and while "Mr. Monk and the Earthquake" was better, they should have done a bit of research on the diaconate before they made it a plot point.) Monk, while he certainly has, ahem, issues, is, in many ways, more morally sane than the average TV character. He was obviously a loving, faithful husband ( His wife has been dead for four years and he isn't even looking at other women. How often do you see that much loyalty to a spouse on the box ?), and is almost scarily transparent.  (As a side note: in one episode, on a list of the terrible things done by a particularly disgusting murderer, his pressuring his girlfriend to abort their child is mentioned. It is also alluded that she has suffered grief from this, and has named her dead baby 'Rachel'.  Again, something one does not see often.)  Of course, for me it's also something of an identification thing. As someone who has OCD, albeit a much milder case than that depicted, I find my sympathies engaged by Monk's symptoms, particularly when they reflect my own. For example,when Monk counted bricks in a wall while on hold, I got a 'been there, done that' feeling.  Some people might find this odd, though. After all, OCD is often not treated as a Big Serious Problem on the show, but  as something to laugh at. Shouldn't I be all huffy ? ("They're not taking my particular problem with the utmost  gravitas . How dare they?") However, OCD is, in a way, a lack of proportion in certain matters. ( The finest example on the show: Monk fleeing from a car which seems to be trying to run him down... yet going slowly enough to keep touching and counting a series of parking meters.) Since humor and a sense of proportion are closely linked, keeping the latter seems to require the former. Thus one could call it therapeutic for me, to have a bit of fun with my own condition... (Um, one of my other symptoms: overanalyzing....it's just a TV show, after all....)

My fondness is for domestic rats, not the wild ones...very different animals. A common comparison made among rat fanciers is that our rats are to the rats on the streets as dogs are to wolves..the former are wonderful pets, the latter wild animals to be treated with caution.

       The Feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary  is today.  " The child is like the parent. Mary was no mere instrument in God's dispensation; the word of God did not merely come to her and go from her; He did not merely pass through her, as He may pass through us in Holy Communion; it was no heavenly body which the Eternal Son assumed, fashioned by the Angels, and brought down to this lower world: no, He imbibed, He sucked up her blood and her substance into His Divine Person; He became man of her; and received her lineaments and her features, as the appearance and character under which He should manifest Himself to the world. He was known doubtless, by His likeness to her, to be her Son. Thus His Mother is the first of Prophets, for of her came the Word bodily; she is the sole oracle of Truth, for the Way, the Truth, and the Life, vouchsafed to be her Son; she is the one mould of Divine Wisdom, and in that mould it was indelibly cast. Surely then, if "the first fruit be holy, the mass also is holy; and if the root be holy, so are the branches." It was natural, it was fitting, that so it should be; it was congruous that, whatever the Omnipotent could work in the person of the finite, should be wrought in her. I say, if the Prophets must be holy, "to whom the word of God comes," what shall we say of her, who was so specially favoured, that the true and substantial Word, and not His shadow or His voice, was not merely made in her, but born of her? who was not merely the organ of God's message, but the origin of His human existence, the living fountain from which He drew His most precious blood, and the material of His most holy flesh? Was it not fitting, beseemed it not, that the Eternal Father should prepare her for this ministration by some pre-eminent sanctification? Do not earthly parents act thus by their children? do they put them out to strangers? do they commit them to any chance person to suckle them? Shall even careless parents show a certain tenderness and solicitude in this matter, and shall not God himself show it, when He commits His Eternal Word to the custody of man? It was to be expected then that, if the Son was God, the Mother should be as worthy of Him, as creature can be worthy of Creator; that grace should have in her its "perfect work"; that, if she bore the Eternal Wisdom, she should be that created wisdom in whom "is all the grace of the Way and the Truth"; that if she was the Mother of "fair love, and fear, and knowledge, and holy hope," "she should give an odour like cinnamon and balm, and sweetness like to choice myrrh." Can we set bounds to the holiness of her who was the Mother of the Holiest?   Such, then, is the truth ever cherished in the deep heart of the Church, and witnessed by the keen apprehension of her children, that no limits but those proper to a creature can be assigned to the sanctity of Mary. Did Abraham believe that a son should be born to him of his aged wife? then Mary's faith was greater when she accepted Gabriel's message. Did Judith consecrate her widowhood to God to the surprise of her people? much more did Mary, from her first youth, devote her virginity. Did Samuel, when a child, inhabit the Temple, secluded from the world? Mary, too, was by her parents lodged in the same holy precincts, at the age when children begin to choose between good and evil. Was Solomon on his birth called "dear to the Lord"? and shall not the destined Mother of God be dear to Him, from the moment she was born? But further still; St. John Baptist was sanctified by the Spirit before his birth; shall Mary be only equal to him? is it not fitting that her privilege should surpass his? is it wonderful, if grace, which anticipated his birth by three months, should in her case run up to the very first moment of her being, outstrip the imputation of sin, and be beforehand with the usurpation of Satan? Mary must surpass all the Saints; the very fact that certain privileges are known to have been theirs, proves to us at once, from the necessity of the case, that she had the same and higher. Her conception then was immaculate, in order that she might surpass all Saints in the date as well as the fullness of her sanctification.

       On a light note  I found this at  urlLink  First Things  , in the Public Square section of the November 2002 issue.   " I dont know who wrote it. These things come in over the Internet transom, so to speak. But the following science report may possibly be pertinent to matters governmental, educational, corporate, and even ecclesiastical. 'A major research institution has recently announced the discovery of the heaviest element yet known to science, with an atomic mass of 312. This new element has been tentatively named Administratium. Administratium has one neutron, 12 assistant neutrons, 75 deputy neutrons, and 111 assistant deputy neutrons. These particles are held together by a force called morons which is surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons. Since Administratium has no electrons, it is inert. However, it can be detected as it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. A minute amount of Administratium causes one reaction to take over four days to complete when it would normally take only a few minutes. Administratium has a normal half-life of three years; it does not decay but instead undergoes a reorganization, in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and deputy neutrons and assistant deputy neutrons exchange places and additional peons are added. In fact, Administratiums mass will actually increase over time, since each reorganization causes some morons to become neutrons forming isodopes. This characteristic of moron-promotion leads some scientists to speculate that Administratium is formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as Critical Morass. ' "

       Jesus the Eternal King  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Our Lord was called Jesus, when He took flesh of the Blessed Virgin. The Angel Gabriel said to her, "Behold, thou shalt bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call His Name Jesus." But, though He then gained a new name, He had existed from eternity; He never was notHe never had a beginningand His true name, therefore, is the Eternal King. He ever reigned with His Father and the Holy Ghost, three Persons, one God. And hence, shortly before His crucifixion, He said, "Glorify Thou Me, O Father, with Thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with Thee" (John xvii. 5). He Who was the Eternal King in heaven, came to be King, and Lord, and Lawgiver, and Judge upon earth. Hence the prophet Isaias says, foretelling His coming, A child is born to us, and a Son is given to us, and the government is upon His shoulder; and His Name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace" (Isaias ix. 6). And when He left the world, He left His power behind Him, and divided it among His followers. He gave one portion of His power to one, another to another. He gave the fulness of His power to St. Peter, and to his successors, who, in consequence, are His vicars and representativesso that, as the Father sent the Son, so the Son has sent St. Peter. But not only St. Peter and the other Apostles, but all bishops and prelates in Holy Church, all pastors of souls, all Christian kings have power from Him, and stand to us in His place.   Let us pray for our Holy Father the Pope, and all Rulers in the Church.   O Emmanuel, God with us, who art the Light that enlighteneth all men, who from the time when Thou camest upon earth, hast never left it to itself, who, after teaching Thy Apostles, gave them to teach others to succeed them, and didst especially leave St. Peter and his successors, Bishops of Rome, to take Thy place towards us, and to guide and rule us in Thy stead age after age, till the end come; Thou hast sent grievous trials for many years upon the Holy See of Rome. We believe and confess, O Lord, without any hesitation at all, that Thou hast promised a continuous duration to Thy Church while the world lastsand we confess before Thee, that we are in no doubt or trouble whatever, we have not a shadow of misgiving as to the permanence and the spiritual well-being either of Thy Church itself or of its rulers. Nor do we know what is best for Thy Church, and for the interests of the Catholic faith, and for the Pope, or the bishops throughout the world at this time. We leave the event entirely to Thee; we do so without any anxiety, knowing that everything must turn to the prosperity of Thy ransomed possession, even though things may look  threatening for a season. Only we earnestly entreat that Thou wouldest give Thy own servant and representative, the Pope Leo(ed. Leo XIII was Pope when this was written), true wisdom and courage, and fortitude, and the consolations of Thy grace in this life, and a glorious immortal crown in the life to come.

       Fanfic blues (and a few tips)  As I mentioned before, I am writing my first Tolkien fanfic. However, the library lost the disk I kept it on, and I have to reconstruct it from memory. (AAAAUUUGH!) I do read Tolkien fanfic as well, but it has become more difficult to find good work since the first of Mr. Jackson's movies came out. Websites are overloaded with, well, dreck, most of it from folks who seem to think that if they've seen the movie(s) and maybe skimmed LOTR once, they are qualified take these characters which have been loved by millions of readers for almost fifty years and do whatever the heck they want with them. My own biggest fanfic peeves are these: 1. "Slash"- Putting Tolkien's characters into same-sex sexual relationships. This is an obvious example of importing modern 'values' (or rather the lack thereof) where they are not only offensive to my faith and the faith of the author, but completely destructive to the spell of Secondary Reality. 2. Related peeve: making his characters heterosexually unchaste in uncanonical ways.  (Writing about, say, Maeglin's lust for Idril, is another matter entirely.)  3. Modern person 'drops into Middle-earth'. Middle-earth is  not  another planet or dimension. It is ours. The Professor was writing about an imagined period of history, not someplace one could drop into. Time travel would be necessary for that sort of thing.  4. "Movieverse" fic. The book is readily available. Writing "movieverse"stuff is just plain lazy.  5. Not bothering to give original characters fitting names. Giving an Elf a non-Elven name (like Rowan or Star or Joy, etc.)  is simply unacceptable.  6. "Crossovers" and importations of things which do not have a place in the Legendarium. The worst are the folks who import the little fluttering flower-fairies Tolkien detested.   In my searches, I have found some gems in the vast mire.  urlLink Thundera Tiger  - my favorite fanfic author. I'd recommend any of her stories, though I would warn you to pack Kleenex when you read "Beyond This World"...I end up sobbing every time.  A little sample of dialogue.. from "Fear No Darkness", on whether or not Gimli.....snores..... "I will have you know, oh great prince, that I have never snored before in my long life and" Gimli trailed off and looked at Aragorn when the man started to splutter. "Is aught wrong?"  "Gimli, I remember very well a certain night along Anduin in which we were attempting to hide from Orcs and your snores kept rattling the boats," Aragorn said between laughs. "Frodo and Merry were paranoid that you would bring the Enemy down upon us, Boromir suggested drowning you, Sam was ready to beat you over the head with one of his pots, Pippin wondered if shaving off your beard might aid your breathing, and the only reason you met with no misfortune that night was because Legolas would walk over and kick you every time one of us rose to strangle you."  "As I recall, my foot was sore by morning," the prince said with a grimace.  "I should have known that you would side with an elf," Gimli growled. "After all, you married one."  I like some of Dwimordene's fics...  urlLink  Fathers and Sons - Faramir fic, dealing with his life from the age of fifteen up until his meeting with two Halflings...  urlLink Brothers At Heart - Young Estel in Rivendell.   urlLink  A Reason to Celebrate - Before the War of the Ring, Aragorn visits his own folk, the Dúnedain of the North, for a special occassion.... WARNING: THIS ONE IS VIOLENT  urlLink  Roots - As Aragorn delivers Gollum to Mirkwood, he ends up in even more trouble than he bargained for.... Here's a few Silmarillion-based ones....  urlLink Long Night  - The Fall of the Noldor, through Nerdanel's eyes ( I have a weakness for things Fëanorian...) WARNING: DISTURBING SITUATION  urlLink Dark Forge - A look at exactly how Maeglin became a traitor... And just for fun.... WARNING: MILD ADULT HUMOR:  urlLink  If Women Had Ruled Middle-earth  The ending is just too funny !   urlLink  A Letter from the Principal  - Little Fëanor... just imagine trying to be one of his schoolteachers !

       "Well, I'm back".... (TTT Spoilers!)  I went to the midnight showing of "The Two Towers". As I did with "Fellowship", I had some problems. The biggest one was the characterization of Faramir, which seemed to make him "Boromir II'. (I'm hoping the extended edition helps this the way it helped the first with Galadriel. )  Also, while I found the appearance of the Ents perfect, I missed the Huorns at Helm's Deep. Actually, it seemed to me that they had made the Ents more "Huornish" than they are in the book: wilder and more hostile to other peoples.  However, there was a good deal to like here as well. The battle scenes were absolutely amazing. They had the Legolas/Gimli Orc-slaying  competition. ("Nineteen...(whack), twenty...(whack) ...twenty-one....") There was a lot of Sam here, and you could see Frodo being corrupted before your eyes. I was happy that some of the later Sam/Frodo dialogue was from my favorite scene in the book.("Let's hear the one about Frodo and the Ring !" )  However, the best thing, IMHO ? In his own words, "Gollum, Gollum". If Andy Serkis doesn't get an Oscar nomination I will be miffed.   Being in the theater was an adventure in itself. Thanks to a friend of mine, I had a reserved seat, so I could wander about. In the line, which was out the door by 11:10 pm , there were "Elves", a good many "Wraiths", and even a Viggo/Aragorn lookalike, as well as miscellaneous people in cloaks. My actual seat was great, though I was not particularly entranced by the patrons on either side.While we all waited for the start (which was delayed)  on my left there was a group of comic book store employees talking shop, and on my  right a group of  action film/anime folks doing the same, and since I'm into neither, it got a bit tiresome listening to how this or that comic series was going to the dogs and how the subtitling was lousy on films I'd never heard of. So I went back to my tattered copy of "The Silmarillion". Also, I am annoyed that  there are commercials as well as trailers before the start of the feature nowadays.  (Can't we go  anywhere  to escape constant bombardment with Pepsi commercials ?)  The audience reaction surprised me at one point. At the point of the Gollum-talking-to-himself scene, I heard laughter. Now what the heck was  that  about ?  This same sort of laughter happened at the first showing of the first film, when Bilbo seems "Gollumish" in Frodo's eyes at Rivendell. Odd.  Well, I need to see it again, of course, at a reasonable hour. I think it will be about three viewings before my opinion is completely solid.  (BTW, if you don't get the reference in the post title, go read the book again.)

       And in Oratory news....  We are coming up on the two big days, Christmas and the ordination. I stopped by, and Deacon Michael was busy trying to get the programs ready. Everything needs to be pretty much set before he goes on his pre-ordination retreat....  The booklets from  urlLink  the Catholic Truth Society  have arrived. I picked up the ones on St. Philip, Blessed Joseph Vaz, C.O., and Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. I am only halfway through the St. Philip one, but it is quite good. It is organized around Venerable Newman's wonderful  Litany of St. Philip . It takes each of St. Philip's 'titles' in the Litany and uses it to comment on his character and life.    Litany of St. Philip  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Christ, hear us. Christ, graciously hear us. God the Father of heaven, Have mercy on us. God the Son, Redeemer of the world, Have mercy on us. God the Holy Ghost, Have mercy on us. Holy Trinity, one God, Have mercy on us.  Holy Mary,             Pray for us. Holy Mother of God,       " Holy Virgin of Virgins, St. Philip, Vessel of the Holy Ghost, Child of Mary, Apostle of Rome,  Counsellor of Popes, Voice of Prophecy, Man of primitive times, Winning Saint, Hidden hero, Sweetest of Fathers, Flower of purity, Martyr of charity, Heart of fire, Discerner of spirits, Choicest of priests, Mirror of the divine life, Pattern of humility, Example of simplicity, Light of holy joy, Image of childhood, Picture of old age, Director of souls, Gentle guide of youth, Patron of thy own, Who didst observe chastity in thy youth, Who didst seek Rome by divine guidance, Who didst bide so long in the Catacombs, Who didst receive the Holy Ghost into thy heart, Who didst experience such wonderful ecstasies, Who didst so lovingly serve the little ones, Who didst wash the feet of pilgrims, Who didst ardently thirst after martyrdom, Who didst distribute the daily word of God, Who didst turn so many hearts to God, Who didst converse so sweetly with Mary, Who didst raise the dead, Who didst set up thy houses in all lands,  Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, Spare us, O Lord. Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, Graciously hear us, O Lord. Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, Have mercy on us. Christ, hear us. Christ, graciously hear us.  V. Remember thy Congregation. R. Which thou hast possessed from the beginning.  Let us Pray  O God, who hast exalted blessed Philip, Thy Confessor, in the glory of Thy saints, grant that, as we rejoice in his commemoration, so we may profit by the example of his virtues, through Christ our Lord.  If anybody has a question on any of the lines of this litany, please e-mail me, and I will try to answer you.

       Yesterday evening  was the last time the Oratory had Vespers with Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, since the students are now scattering to the four winds for Christmas break. It will begin again on Epiphany. I was glad that the hymns sung were  "Rejoice ! The Lord is King!"  and my absolute favorite hymn of all time....  Let all mortal flesh keep silence, And with fear and trembling stand; Ponder nothing earthly minded, For with blessing in His hand, Christ our God to earth descendeth, Our full homage to demand.  King of kings, yet born of Mary, As of old on earth He stood, Lord of lords, in human vesture, In the Body and the Blood; He will give to all the faithful His own Self for heavenly food.  Rank on rank the host of heaven Spreads its vanguard on the way, As the Light of light descendeth From the realms of endless day, That the powers of hell may vanish As the darkness clears away.  At His feet the six wingèd seraph, Cherubim with sleepless eye, Veil their faces to the presence, As with ceaseless voice they cry: Alleluia, Alleluia Alleluia, Lord Most High!

       Speaking of Tolkien-related misspellings,  I have a sneaking fondness for "The Official Fanfiction University of Middle-earth" by Camilla Sandman. The humor is sometimes (OK, often) crude, the language is unecessarily coarse, and it is most definitely  not  for children, teens, or the easily offended. However, some of it is quite funny, particularly to a person who sometimes slogs through the mire that is Tolkien fanfic on the web in search of its infrequent gems. I'm not linking to it because I try to keep my blog family-friendly, but some parts make me laugh out loud.  What does this have to do with misspellings ? Well, perhaps the most brilliant idea in the fic is the concept of ..the mini-balrog. These critters kept things running at the school, and they simply appear out nowhere whenever somebody misspells a Tolkien-related word in a fanfic or a fanfic comment. The author uses only real misspellings found in posted work.  I can recommend  urlLink Miss Cam's (Ever-Growing) List O'Mini-Balrogs  wholeheartedly. Some of them are, well, amazing. ("Phrodo" ? "Yowyn" ? And best of all..."Treebread" ! )

       Oh, dear....  Tolkien mentions are multiplying in the Blogosphere. For example there's  urlLink  this post  , and  urlLink  this one   which actually links to my blog as well. I should be happy about this, and I am. But there is one thing in these two posts which makes me less than thrilled...messed up Tolkienean spelling.  The first says "For you Tolkien fans, this is like worshiping a Valor instead of Illuvatar who created them! "  The group of beings referred to are, collectively, the  Valar , not the Valor. The singular form is "Vala".  The Elven name for God is Ilúvatar, "All-father".   The second commits the granddaddy of all Tolkienean errors....'Tolkein'. This one was a problem for the Professor himself in his lifetime.   "My name is TOLKIEN ( not -kein ). It is a German name (from Saxony), an anglicization of  Tollkiehn , i.e.  tollkühn . But, except as a guide to spelling, this fact is as fallacious as all facts are in the raw. For I am neither 'foolhardy' (ed. the meaning of  tollkühn ) nor German, whatever some remote ancestors may have been. They migrated to England more than 200 years ago...." - J.R.R. Tolkien to his American publisher, 1955 "My surname is now usually misspelt TOLKEIN in spite of all my efforts to correct this-even by my college-, bank-, and lawyer's clerks !" - J.R.R. Tolkien to Graham Tayar, June 5, 1971 (Both quotes are from  The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien  ed. Humphrey Carpenter.)  I know, I'm turning into the Nihil Obstat of Arda here......

       If it were not Sunday,  today would be the date of commemoration of Blessed Antony Grassi, of the Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Fermo, a  beatus  for whom I have an especial fondness. Unfortunately, I don't see much about him in English on the Internet. So I will post a little on him here.  Antony Grassi lived in Fermo in what is now Italy, in the 17th century. As a young boy, he met Fr. Flaminio Ricci, who had been a disciple of St. Philip himself, and joined the Oratory at Fermo at the age of seventeen. While he suffered from scruples as a seminarian, he overcame this with the help of the Lord and his community. He became known for his amazing serenity, and several people testified that they had never seen him annoyed, let alone angry. (Oh brother, do I need his intercession !)  Perhaps the most remarkable event of his life occurred when he was a young priest of 29. He went to the Holy House at Loreto, and while praying there he was, believe it or not, hit by lightning. When he first regained consciousness he was unable to move or speak, and once he could speak he, understandably, asked for the last sacraments, thinking that he would die soon. However, this did not happen, and after a few days he made a complete recovery. For the rest of his life, Antony constantly gave thanks to God for sparing his life in this spectacular fashion. (He gave some of his scorched clothing to the shrine as an  ex voto , and made a pilgrimage to Loreto every year on the anniversary.)  He spent large amounts of time hearing confessions and visiting the sick and the dying. People with problems flocked to him, and he made time for them. Later, when riots broke out in Fermo over a food shortage, he attemped to mediate between the rioters and the government. Unfortunately, this was not successful, and Antony was nearly shot by someone in the mob of rioters.  In 1635, his community elected him Provost ( superior), and they continued to do so every three years for the rest of his life. He was known for both his insistence on following the Oratorian constitutions closely, and for his gentleness. When he was asked why he was not more severe, he stated that he did not know how, then remarked, "Is this the way ?" and proceeded to assume an air of mock pomposity and arrogance. He, like St. Philip, was less enthusiastic about physical penances than many devout people of his time. He said "Humbling the mind and will is more effective than a hair-shirt. "  In the last few years of his life, he had to stop preaching, as he could not make his listeners understand him. Then he realized that he was going deaf, which made his apostolate in the confessional at first difficult and finally impossible. However, even as an elderly man, he tried to keep and spread the joy of Christ. One of his last recorded acts was his reconciliation of two brothers who had been violently quarreling for years. Antony Grassi went to his reward in 1671. Due to various civil disturbances in Italy, his beatification did not happen until 1900.

       The Third Sunday of Advent... Gaudete Semper !    Today is special to Oratorians, as it is a day in which the Scripture tells us to 'rejoice always'...which St. Philip did so very well and his sons and daughters strive, stumblingly, to do also.  Fr. Joseph was the celebrant. What I remember most about the homily was his statement that true joy comes "not from papering over our sins, but from repenting of them and receiving the joy of the Lord."

We chanted all six verses, with certain variations on them. (The first verse was sung by the men only, the second by all, the third by women only, the fourth by all, the fifth by all, but with the basses and altos dropping down so that we were singing parallel fifths, and the sixth by all. )

       A big thank you  to all the folks who sent repsonses to my plea for technical assistance . I received mail from  urlLink dylan  ,  urlLink Mr. Riddle ,  urlLink  Mr. Miller , and  urlLink  Mr. Esguerra  . Showing me how to put in these characters this is a big help, especially because I like my quotes in Elvish to be accurate, and these characters are necessary for that. For example, my 'online name' is Nârwen, not Narwen. The two have different meanings,"Rat-maiden" and "Fire-maiden" respectively. The blog is  Quenta Nârwenion  , the 'story of the Rat-maiden' as the tale of the Great Jewels, or  silmarilli , is the  Quenta Silmarillion  .

       It was just so beautiful....  I will be blogging on the ordination and Fr. Michael's First Mass later... probably Monday when I will have a bit more computer time available. The little bit of time I have this weekend just can't do it anywhere close to justice.  For now, here's the music list: Processional Hymn: "Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken" Laying On of Hands: "Veni Creator Spiritus"- (of course !) Offertory: "If Ye Love Me" - Thomas Tallis (1508-1585) Communion: "Vox in Rama Audita Est"- Clemens non Papa (1510-1556) -(it is the Feast of the Holy Innocents, after all....)  Recessional Hymn: "Holy God, We Praise Thy Name"

       The Oratory's best "Christmas present"  "arrives" on Saturday, the Feast of the Holy Innocents. I am, of course, talking about the ordination of Deacon Michael Darcy, C.O. to the priesthood. This means that while for other people things are winding down a bit after Christmas Day, my little corner of the world is still at a level of great excitement. This is particularly true for choir members, because we are singing at the ordination and Fr.'s First Mass on Sunday.  Prayers for our soon-to-be-priest would, of course, be appreciated.

       Blessed Christmas to all !  "Let us reflect that the Word left Heaven, and stooped to become man for us." - St. Philip Neri  "His condescension in coming down from heaven, in leaving His Father's glory and taking flesh, is so far beyond power of words or thought, that one might consider at first sight that it mattered little whether He came as a prince or a beggar. And yet after all, it is much more wonderful that He came in low estate, for this reason; because it might have been thought beforehand, that, though He condescended to come on earth, yet He would not submit to be overlooked and despised: now the rich are not despised by the world, and the poor are. If He had come as a great prince or noble, the world without knowing a whit more that He was God, yet would at least have looked up to Him and honoured Him, as being a prince; but when He came in a low estate, He took upon him one additional humiliation, contempt,being contemned, scorned, rudely passed by, roughly profaned by His creatures.  What were the actual circumstances of His coming? His Mother is a poor woman; she comes to Bethlehem to be taxed, travelling, when her choice would have been to remain at home. She finds there is no room in the inn; she is obliged to betake herself to a stable; she brings forth her firstborn Son, and lays Him in a manger. That little babe, so born, so placed, is none other than the Creator of heaven and earth, the Eternal Son of God."- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  " '  Those of the Old Hope ? ' said Finrod. 'Who are they ?'     'A few', she said; 'but their number has grown since we came to this land, and they see that the Nameless can (as they think) be defied. Yet that is no good reason. To defy him does not undo his work of old. And if the valour of the Eldar fails here, then their despair will be deeper. For it was not on the might of Men, or of any of the peoples of Arda, that the old hope was grounded.' 'What then was this hope, if you know ?' Finrod asked. "They say,' answered Andreth: 'They say that the One will Himself enter Arda, and heal Men and all the Marring from the beginning to the end. '  "- J.R.R. Tolkien,  Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth

       The Feast of St. John Cantius  is today. Click  urlLink  here   for information. Monsignor Ronald Knox had a particular fondness for this saint, and mentioned him in several sermons. He was especially fond of one incident in the saint's life. On one of St. John's pilgrimages, he was attacked by brigands. He happily gave them what little money he had, and told the thieves that there was no more. After they had departed, he remembered that, upon the advice of friends, he had sewn some coins into his clothes. He  did  have more money, but he had forgotten ! So he charged after the astonished robbers, yelling, "Wait ! Wait ! I do have more !" The bandits were so embarrassed by his extraordinary generosity that they not only didn't take these coins, they even gave back what they had stolen from him. (The 'coals-of-fire' principle in action !)

       On the folks who try to take Christ out of Christmas  I found  urlLink  this   brilliant piece over at  urlLink  Removing  All Doubt .  This sort of thing is older than many people suppose. I found this bit of verse by the great G.K. Chesterton a while ago. It was his comment on an incident he found in the news of his time....  A CHRISTMAS CAROL by G.K. Chesterton  ( The Chief Constable has issued a statement declaring that carol singing in the streets by children is illegal, and morally and physically injurious. He appeals to the public to discourage the practice.  -Daily Paper )  God rest you merry gentlemen, Let nothing you dismay; The Herald Angels cannot sing, The cops arrest them on the wing, And warn them of the docketing  Of anything they say.  God rest you merry gentlemen, May nothing you dismay: On your reposeful cities lie Deep silence, broken only by The motor-horn's melodious cry, The hooter's happy bray.  So, when the song of children ceased, And Herod was obeyed, In his high hall Corinthian With purple and with peacock fan, Rested that merry gentleman; And nothing him dismayed.

       When Venerable Newman became Catholic...  it was not the custom for Catholic priests to write out their sermons, while Anglican clergy did generally write down what they would preach. Therefore we have fewer sermons from the Venerable's Catholic period than his Anglican one. However, there is a volume of his sermon notes, dating from his Catholic years. While they are not complete, they are interesting nevertheless. Here is the set of notes from one sermon: 1851 The Special Charm of Christmas 1. INTROD.[The] two chief festivals [of the Church are] Easter and Christmas; [of these] Easter [is] the greater.  2. Yet somehow we adorn our churches more brightly and spontaneously, now than then. There is more of heart, apparently, in what we do. And there is an inexpressible charm over all. The midnight Mass, the three Masses. The special representations, whether the Stable or the Infant. [Again, the singing of] carols.  3. Why is this? Christmas is easier to understand to the mass of men; it comes home to them more readily, and imposes an easier duty on our worship.  4. It is the difference between coming and going. The apostles felt that sorrow filled their hearts [at the going of the Lord].  Mane nobiscum Domine.  Easter is the feast of the perfect. If we were perfect, we should rejoice in Easter the more [of the two festivals]. In the one Christ comes to us, in the other we go to Christ.  5. All our human feelings are soothed by Christmas Abraham had to leave his country.We naturally do not like to move. We are allowed to remain at home: Christ comes to us as our guest.  6. And coming, He brightens everything. He does not take away, He adds. He adds grace to Nature. If at any time we might love the world, it is now. If at any time, [it is when He is come to be our Emmanuel].  7. He makes the world our home, for he deigns to be the light of it. He sanctifies families with the image of Mary and Jesus. And where there is no home in a family, then He brings us all together in one family in church. The midnight Mass is our holy celebration [of Christmas], eclipsing the world's merrymaking.  8. And we think of Him who put off all His glory, of which our celebrations are but a type. The priestly vestments a type of His glory, [which He put off in order] to come into this bleak prison and suffer for us.  9. Let us rejoice in  Him.

       Gee...  I post a Tolkien quote on Saturday and it gets quoted on  urlLink  two    urlLink  other   blogs, one of which is in Spanish. The Blogosphere is amazing.  I would recommend  The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien   to anyone, of course. Not only do many have information on the Third Age of Middle-earth which is not contained elsewhere, but they reveal a man who had some interesting things to say about other subjects as well, from language to war to the Faith. To me, perhaps the most moving one is a letter he wrote to his son Christopher after the death of his wife Edith.  "I have at last got busy about Mummy's grave... The inscription I should like is :                                                                        EDITH MARY TOLKIEN                                                                               1889-1971                                                                                 Lúthien  ; brief and jejune, except for  Lúthien  , which says more for me than a multitude of words; for she was (and knew she was) my Lúthien." J.R.R. Tolkien to Christopher Tolkien, July 11, 1972.   It was urlLink  done  , of course. (The emblems are those of Lúthien and Beren, and were placed there for a special occasion.)

       Joyous note....and an odd little grouse..  Tommorow is the day when we, in the US, celebrate  urlLink  the Epiphany of the Lord.  That means that Vespers with Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament starts up again tommorow evening . Yes ! If it were not Sunday, it would be the feast of a saint I'm afraid I have somewhat mixed feelings about:  urlLink  Saint John Nepomucene Neumann  . I don't have a problem with his life or anything, just his name. People  will  mispronounce it, you see. The saint had a German father. Therefore his surname, would, properly, be pronounced "Noy-mann", I believe. However, in our English-speaking sloppiness it is common to anglicize it as "Noo-man".... and herein lies my problem.  I've lost track of the number of times I've had to explain, "no, Venerable Newman is not the saint who lived in Philadelphia...."   Once, I even came across a website on the saints which had information on the two men hopelessly conflated. Arrrgh!

       Today is the Feast of the Most Holy Name of Jesus, and, on an infinitely lesser level, the eleventy-first anniversary of the birth of the Professor...  The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass was duly offered today for "the repose of the soul of John on the one-hundred-and-eleventh anniversary of his birth. " ( I hadn't a clue that somebody in urlLink  Chicago  , of all places,  picked up on this ! ) It is appropriate that  the recently re-established  urlLink Feast of the Most Holy Name of Jesus  is today, since Tolkien spent his life and thought dealing with words and names..... May the name of Jesus Christ be praised now and forever ! Amen ! And rest in the peace and joy of  Eru , Professor,  Essenen Atarwa, ar Yondova, ar Ainasúleva. Amen .

       OK, about the ordination ...  (Note: these are my reflections, and are not being checked over by anybody.Therefore any infelicities of expression are mine and mine only.)  What can I say ? Moving, glorious, amazing. I was, of course, in the Cathedral's choir loft, which meant I didn't exactly have a close-up view... but it was still incredible.  The readings were wonderful. First Reading : Jeremiah 1:4-9 "4 The word of the LORD came to me thus: 5 Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I dedicated you, a prophet to the nations I appointed you. 6 "Ah, Lord GOD!" I said, "I know not how to speak; I am too young." 7 But the LORD answered me, Say not, "I am too young." To whomever I send you, you shall go; whatever I command you, you shall speak. 8 Have no fear before them, because I am with you to deliver you, says the LORD. 9 Then the LORD extended his hand and touched my mouth, saying, See, I place my words in your mouth! "  Second Reading: Acts of the Apostles 20:17-36 "17 From Miletus he had the presbyters of the church at Ephesus summoned. 18 When they came to him, he addressed them, "You know how I lived among you the whole time from the day I first came to the province of Asia. 19 I served the Lord with all humility and with the tears and trials that came to me because of the plots of the Jews, 20 and I did not at all shrink from telling you what was for your benefit, or from teaching you in public or in your homes. 21 I earnestly bore witness for both Jews and Greeks to repentance before God and to faith in our Lord Jesus. 22 But now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem. What will happen to me there I do not know, 23 except that in one city after another the holy Spirit has been warning me that imprisonment and hardships await me. 24 Yet I consider life of no importance to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to bear witness to the gospel of God's grace. 25 "But now I know that none of you to whom I preached the kingdom during my travels will ever see my face again. 26 And so I solemnly declare to you this day that I am not responsible for the blood of any of you, 27 for I did not shrink from proclaiming to you the entire plan of God. 28 Keep watch over yourselves and over the whole flock of which the holy Spirit has appointed you overseers,in which you tend the church of God that he acquired with his own blood. 29 I know that after my departure savage wolves will come among you, and they will not spare the flock. 30 And from your own group, men will come forward perverting the truth to draw the disciples away after them. 31 So be vigilant and remember that for three years, night and day, I unceasingly admonished each of you with tears. 32 And now I commend you to God and to that gracious word of his that can build you up and give you the inheritance among all who are consecrated. 33 I have never wanted anyone's silver or gold or clothing. 34 You know well that these very hands have served my needs and my companions. 35 In every way I have shown you that by hard work of that sort we must help the weak, and keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus who himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'" 36 When he had finished speaking he knelt down and prayed with them all. " Gospel: St. John 17:6, 14-19  " 6 "I revealed Your Name to those whom You gave Me out of the world. They belonged to You, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. 14 I gave them Your word, and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world. 15 I do not ask that You take them out of the world but that You keep them from the evil one. 16 They do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world. 17 Consecrate them in the truth. Your word is truth. 18 As You sent Me into the world, so I sent them into the world. 19 And I consecrate Myself for them, so that they also may be consecrated in truth. "   In the actual Rite of Ordination, the two things which moved me the most came one after the other: first the Litany of the Saints, and then the Laying On of Hands and the Prayer of Consecration. The first is remarkable since, besides Good Friday, it is ( so far as I know) the only time in the Western Church  when someone  is not just kneeling but lying prostrate, i.e. flat on his face, before God.  The candidate lies there while the Litany is chanted and all of us sing the responses, asking the holy ones of God from the past two thousand years to intercede for this man who is about to become 'a priest forever', and then beseeching God to give him His blessing . As the Litany says: " Ut hunc electum benedicere et sanctificare et consecrare digneris/  Te rogamus, audi nos  " ("Bless this chosen man, make him holy, and consecrate him for his sacred duties/ We beseech You, hear us")  This is followed by the Laying On of Hands, and the Prayer of Consecration...the critical moment. When Michael knelt down, he was still a candidate for the priesthood. After the Bishop had put his hands on Michael's head and Prayer of Consecration, he was a priest-still to be vested in stole and chasuble, still to have his hands anointed by the sacred chrism, but a priest. I have been blessed to witness several ordinations, and that moment always sends a quiver of joy through me. It continues. The Lord calls and some still respond, despite all the cultural mess and rampant poor catechesis. Blessed be His Holy Name !  There was a lot more, of course. Listening to  Fr.  Michael as he prayed part of the Eucharistic Prayer for the first time was wonderful. The fact that about fifteen or so priests came to concelebrate on the Saturday after Christmas was a blessing, and they included not only the other Pittsburgh Oratorians and diocesan priests but Fr. Kurt Belsole, O.S.B, Rector of the seminary where Fr. Michael studied , some of Fr. Belsole's fellow Benedictines, and Fr. Daniels, the Provost of the Pharr Oratory, down in southern Texas.  I won't say much about the reception afterwards, since this post is already long, but it was certainly a time to rejoice ! I'll blog on the First Mass another time...

       Just a little reminder...  January 3, 2003, is the day upon which the Professor would have been eleventy-one. As I remarked  urlLink  here  , I have arranged for Mass to be said for the repose of his soul tommorow at 5:15 pm, at the Pittsburgh Oratory. I doubt that people would be able to attend, but perhaps my readers could pray for him.

       For tommorow's feast  Mary is the "Mater Creatoris," the Mother of the Creator- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   This is a title which, of all others, we should have thought it impossible for any creature to possess. At first sight we might be tempted to say that it throws into confusion our primary ideas of the Creator and the creature, the Eternal and the temporal, the Self-subsisting and the dependent; and yet on further consideration we shall see that we cannot refuse the title to Mary without denying the Divine Incarnationthat is, the great and fundamental truth of revelation, that God became man.  And this was seen from the first age of the Church. Christians were accustomed from the first to call the Blessed Virgin "The Mother of God," because they saw that it was impossible to deny her that title without denying St. John's words, "The Word" (that is, God the Son) "was made flesh."  And in no long time it was found necessary to proclaim this truth by the voice of an Ecumenical Council of the Church. For, in consequence of the dislike which men have of a mystery, the error sprang up that our Lord was not really God, but a man, differing from us in this merelythat God dwelt in Him, as God dwells in all good men, only in a higher measure; as the Holy Spirit dwelt in Angels and Prophets, as in a sort of Temple; or again, as our Lord now dwells in the Tabernacle in church. And then the bishops and faithful people found there was no other way of hindering this false, bad view being taught but by declaring distinctly, and making it a point of faith, that Mary was the Mother, not of man only, but of God. And since that time the title of Mary, as Mother of God, has become what is called a dogma, or article of faith, in the Church.  But this leads us to a larger view of the subject. Is this title as given to Mary more wonderful than the doctrine that God, without ceasing to be God, should become man? Is it more mysterious that Mary should be Mother of God, than that God should be man? Yet the latter, as I have said, is the elementary truth of revelation, witnessed by Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles all through Scripture. And what can be more consoling and joyful than the wonderful promises which follow from this truth, that Mary is the Mother of God?the great wonder, namely, that we become the brethren of our God; that, if we live well, and die in the grace of God, we shall all of us hereafter be taken up by our Incarnate God to that place where angels dwell; that our bodies shall be raised from the dust, and be taken to Heaven; that we shall be really united to God; that we shall be partakers of the Divine nature; that each of us, soul and body, shall be plunged into the abyss of glory which surrounds the Almighty; that we shall see Him, and share His blessedness, according to the text, "Whosoever shall do the will of My Father that is in Heaven, the same is My brother, and sister, and mother."

       Exciting news   urlLink  This  ought to be good. However, Elvish, in its two primary forms, is  not  primarily based on early English. Quenya was influenced by Finnish and Sindarin by Welsh. The Professor did use Old English to a certain extent in  The Lord of the Rings , but he used it to represent the language of the Rohirrim.

       I've added two links on the left.  One, under "Tolkien Links" is to the  urlLink  Encylopedia of Arda  , one of the better reference sites I've come across. The other, listed under "Oratorian links" is to the official site of  urlLink  Heinz Chapel . Heinz Chapel actually belongs to the University of Pittsburgh, but I have the site listed since the Fathers celebrate Mass there every Sunday, and every weekday during the school year. It's not a Catholic church,  the Eucharist cannot be reserved there, and some of the people in the windows are not ones I would have wanted commemorated, but such is life. It's more inspiring,architecturally,  than some of the buildings that actually are Catholic churches, alas !

       I'm a bit worried  The piece on Aragorn I linked to is getting clobbered in the comments box in the  urlLink  place   where I found it. I may have blogged too quickly on the thing. If anybody puts up something defending Aragorn/Strider/Elessar Telcontar/all the rest of the names he acquired in his life, I'm liable to like it, even if the writing isn't up to par.

       A problem with G.K. Chesterton  Things he uses as examples of   reductio ad absurdum  are now being outdone by reality. Take this passage from "The Everlasting Man", where G.K.C. discusses the horror of the Carthginian Empire: "These highly civilised people really met together to invoke the blessing of heaven on their empire by throwing hundreds of their infants into a large furnace. We can only realise the combination by imagining a number of Manchester merchants with chimney-pot hats and mutton-chop whiskers, going to church every Sunday at eleven o'clock to see a baby roasted alive. "  Compare it with  urlLink  this  monstrosity apparently being shown in Chesterton's own country now.

JOHN, HENRY AUSTIN MILLS, HENRY BITTLESTON, EDWARD CASWALL, WILLIAM PAINE NEVILLE, and HENRY IGNATIUS DUDLEY RYDER? who have been so faithful to me; who have been so sensitive of my needs; who have been so indulgent to my failings; who have carried me through so many trials; who have grudged no sacrifice, if I asked for it; who have been so cheerful under discouragements of my causing; who have done so many good works, and let me have the credit of them;with whom I have lived so long, with whom I hope to die.  And to you especially, dear AMBROSE ST. JOHN; whom God gave me, when He took every one else away; who are the link between my old life and my new; who have now for twenty-one years been so devoted to me, so patient, so zealous, so tender; who have let me lean so hard upon you; who have watched me so narrowly; who have never thought of yourself, if I was in question.  And in you I gather up and bear in memory those familiar affectionate companions and counsellors, who in Oxford were given to me, one after another, to be my daily solace and relief; and all those others, of great name and high example, who were my thorough friends, and showed me true attachment in times long past; and also those many younger men, whether I knew them or not, who have never been disloyal to me by word or deed; and of all these, thus various in their relations to me, those more especially who have since joined the Catholic Church.  And I earnestly pray for this whole company, with a hope against hope, that all of us, who once were so united, and so happy in our union, may even now be brought at length, by the Power of the Divine Will, into One Fold and under One Shepherd.  May 26, 1864. In Festo Corp. Christ. "

       Jesus, Son of Mary  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  When our Lord came upon earth, He might have created a fresh body for Himself out of nothingor He might have formed a body for Himself out of the earth, as He formed Adam. But He preferred to be born, as other men are born, of a human mother. Why did He do so? He did so to put honour on all those earthly relations and connections which are ours by nature; and to teach us that, though He has begun a new creation, He does not wish us to cast off the old creation, as far as it is not sinful. Hence it is our duty to love and honour our parents, to be affectionate to our brothers, sisters, friends, husbands, wives, not only not less, but even more, than it was man's duty before our Lord came on earth. As we become better Christians, more consistent and zealous servants of Jesus, we shall become only more and more anxious for the good of all around usour kindred, our friends, our acquaintances, our neighbours, our superiors, our inferiors, our masters, our employers. And this we shall do from the recollection how our Lord loved His Mother. He loves her still in heaven with a special love. He refuses her nothing. We then on earth must feel a tender solicitude for all our relations, all our friends, all whom we know or have dealings with. And moreover, we must love not only those who love us, but those who hate us or injure us, that we may imitate Him, who not only was loving to His Mother, but even suffered Judas, the traitor, to kiss Him, and prayed for His murderers on the cross.   Let us pray God for our relations, friends, well wishers, and enemies, living and dead.   O Jesus, son of Mary, whom Mary followed to the Cross when Thy disciples fled, and who didst bear her tenderly in mind in the midst of Thy sufferings, even in Thy last words, who didst commit her to Thy best beloved disciple, saying to her, "Woman, behold thy son," and to him, "Behold thy Mother," we, after Thy pattern, would pray for all who are near and dear to us, and we beg Thy grace to do so continually. We beg Thee to bring them all into the light of Thy truth, or to keep them in Thy truth if they already know it, and to keep them in a state of grace, and to give them the gift of perseverance. We thus pray for our parents, for our fathers and our mothers, for our children, for every one of them, for our brothers and sisters, for every one of our brothers, for every one of our sisters, for our cousins and all our kindred, for our friends, and our father's friends, for all our old friends, for our dear and intimate friends, for our teachers, for our pupils, for our masters and employers, for our servants or subordinates, for our associates and work-fellows, for our neighbours, for our superiors and rulers; for those who wish us well, for those who wish us ill; for our enemies; for our rivals; for our injurers and for our slanderers. And not only for the living, but for the dead, who have died in the grace of God, that He may shorten their time of expiation, and admit them into His presence above.

       Two surprises today...  The big one... I mentioned the Pittsburgh Oratory elections were going to be held yesterday. Well, the Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Pittsburgh has a new Provost ! The exclamation point is because this is definitely a surprise, as the previous Provost had served for many years. Please pray for Fr. David Abernethy, C.O., as he sets about the task God and his brothers in St. Philip have set for him.   The other surprise happened while I was helping put away the altar linens and such after Mass. There was a priest visiting Pittsburgh from West Virginia, and he was speaking with Fr. Michael and Fr. Joseph at the door of the ambulatory. (Heinz Chapel is non-denominational and, while the Oratory celebrates daily Mass there, it is missing certain features a Catholic church would have. Thus there is no sacristy and the things needed for Mass must be kept in a cupboard in the ambulatory.) I had just closed the cupboard door when I heard the visiting priest say "Actually, I've found that some lady involved with the Oratory here has a blog..."

       Feast of St. Raymond of Peñafort... and a "From the homily"   There's information on the saint urlLink  here . Fr. Michael was the main celebrant, with Fr. Joseph concelebrating. The homily focused on the first reading, particularly the verse "In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as expiation for our sins." One of the points was that, while many people scoff at theology as 'hairsplitting',  without a proper theological understanding of who Christ is, the true meaning of love as sacrificial is lessened. For example, denying Christ's full divinity, as certain early heresies and many modern 'Christians' do, implies that God has not completely given Himself  in the Crucifixion. If even God has not given Himself, then how could we, in our weakness and sinfulness, give of ourselves in the way God desires ? Only through, and in imitation of, His ultimate act of love can we follow Him, as the saints throughout the ages have, and thus by the power of His grace gain the salvation He won for us.

       Lots of things connected with this date....  Besides being the traditional (and international) date for Epiphany, today is also feast of  urlLink  Blessed Andre Bessette.    Also, on this date, in 1982, Fr. William Clancy, C.O., Provost of the Pittsburgh Oratory, went to his reward. Prayers for the repose of his soul would, of course, be appreciated. I never knew him personally, since I did not encounter the Oratory until a good many years after his death, but the affection and respect with which he is remembered by the priests here who did know him speaks a great deal.  One of these priests gave me permission to recount this little anecdote. When he was a novice, (and still an undergraduate in college, I believe)  he went to see a movie... The Exorcist . He was deeply disturbed by the film, and Fr. Clancy noticed that something was troubling him. After he admitted that he had found the depiction of demons terrifying, to the point where he was having a bit of difficulty sleeping, Fr. Clancy gave him some advice, which included this little quote.  "Demons climbing up the side of the Oratory to come get you aren't the problem. If they did come like that, what would happen ? You'd pray- and why on earth would they want to make you do  that  ? The problem is demons climbing up the side of your  heart , tempting to pettiness, jealousy, lack of charity, and so on... That's the everyday Enemy."  Finally, this is also the date of the triennial Election of the Provost and Deputies for the Pittsburgh Oratory. It seems it has been held on this date since Fr. Clancy went to his reward, since the community needed to elect a new Provost upon his death  . Please pray that the Fathers may be guided by the Holy Spirit in this matter.

       While we celebrate Epiphany today in the US...  Elsewhere it is the vigil, or Epiphany Eve. It was also the date Mary Newman, the Venerable's youngest sister, and the one closest to him, died suddenly at the age of nineteen. This was a terrible blow to him, and it, along with an illness of his own and  other factors, helped keep him from sympathy with the 'liberalizing' tendencies common among many of the Fellows of Oriel College. As he states in the  Apologia Pro Vita Sua  : " The truth is, I was beginning to prefer intellectual excellence to moral: I was drifting in the direction of liberalism. I was rudely awakened from my dream at the end of 1827 by two great blowsillness and bereavement." He wrote a verse on the subject a few years later:  Epiphany-Eve  A Birthday Offering    Birthday gifts, with the early year,  Lo! we bring thee, Mary dear!  Prayer and praise upon thy death  Twined together in a wreath,  Grief and gladness, such as may  Suit a solemn holiday.  Christmas snow, for maiden's bloom  Blanched in winter's sudden tomb;  Christmas berries, His red token  Who that grave's stern seal hath broken;  These for thee the faithful heart,  Due mementos, sets apart.   'Twas a fast, that Eve of sorrow,  Herald veil'd of glorious morrow.  Speechless we sat; and watch'd, to know How it would be; but time moved slow,  Along that day of sacred woe.  Then came the Feast, and we were told  Bravely of our best to bring,  Myrrh, and frankincense, and gold,  As our tribute to our King.   Dearest, gentlest, purest, best!  Deep is thy mysterious rest,  Now the solemn hours are over  And the Angels round thee hover,  With the fanning of their wings  Keeping time to one who sings  Of high themes consolatory,  Of the All-loving and His glory,  Of the age that has no ending,  Of the day of thy ascending  From those shades of paradise  To the bright supernal skies.   Thinkest of us, dearest, ever?  Ah! so be it nought can sever  Spirit and life, the past and present,  Still we yield thee musings pleasant.  God above, and we below;  So thought ranges, to and fro.  He, in sooth, by tutorings mild,  From the rude clay shaped His child,  Fiery trial, anguish chill,  Served not here His secret will;  But His voice was low and tender,  And so true was thy surrender,  That the work in haste was done,  Grace and nature blent in one.  Harmless thus, and not unmeet,  To kiss the dear prints of thy feet,  Tracing thus the narrow road  All must tread, and Christ has trod.   Loveliest, meekest, blithest, kindest!  Lead! we seek the home thou findest!  Though thy name to us most dear,  Go! we would not have thee here.  Lead, a guiding beacon bright  To travellers on the Eve of Light.  Welcome aye thy Star before us,  Bring it grief or gladness o'er us;  Keen regret and tearful yearning, Whiles unfelt, and whiles returning;  Or more gracious thoughts abiding,  Fever-quelling, sorrow-chiding;  Or, when day-light blessings fail,  Transport fresh as spice-fraught gale,  Sparks from thee, which oft have lighted  Weary heart and hope benighted.   I this monument would raise,  Distant from the public gaze.  Few will see it;few e'er knew thee;  But their beating hearts pursue thee,  And their eyes fond thoughts betoken,  Though thy name be seldom spoken.  Pass on, stranger, and despise it!  These will read, and these will prize it.    Oxford. January 5, 1830.

       Lane Core  reminds everyone that  urlLink the Octave of Prayer for Christian Unity  begins tommorow. In addition to the resources at the link,  I offer the following prayer composed by the Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Jesus the Only Begotten Son  Jesus is the only Son of the only Fatheras it is said in the Creed, "I believe in one God, the Father Almighty," and then "and in Jesus Christ, His only Son our Lord." And so He Himself says in the Gospel, "As the Father hath life in Himself, so He hath given to the Son also to have life in Himself" (John v. 26). And He said to the man whom He cured of blindness, "Dost thou believe in the Son of God? It is He that talketh with thee" (John ix. 35-37). And St. John the Evangelist says, "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father" (John i. 14). And St. John Baptist says, "The Father loveth the Son and He hath given all things into His hand. He that believeth in the Son, hath life everlasting" (John iii. 35, 36). And St. Paul says, "There is one body and one Spiritas ye are called in one hope of your calling. One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all" (Eph. iv. 4-6).  Thus Almighty God has set up all things in unityand therefore His Holy Church in a special way, as the Creed again says, "One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church." It is His wise and gracious will that His followers should not follow their own way, and form many bodies, but one. This was the meaning of the mystery of His garment at the time of His crucifixion, which "was without seam, woven from the top throughout" (John xix. 23). And therefore was it that the soldiers were not allowed to break His sacred limbs, for like the Jewish Easter Lamb not a bone of Him was to be broken.   Let us pray for the unity of the Church and the reconciliation and peace of all Christians.   O Lord Jesus Christ, who, when Thou wast about to suffer, didst pray for Thy disciples to the end of time that they might all be one, as Thou art in the Father, and the Father in Thee, look down in pity on the manifold divisions among those who profess Thy faith, and heal the many wounds which the pride of man and the craft of Satan have inflicted upon Thy people. Break down the walls of separation which divide one party and denomination of Christians from another. Look with compassion on the souls who have been born in one or other of these various communions which not Thou, but man hath made. Set free the prisoners from these unauthorised forms of worship, and bring them all into that one communion which thou didst set up in the beginning, the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. Teach all men that the see of St. Peter, the Holy Church of Rome, is the foundation, centre, and instrument of unity. Open their hearts to the long-forgotten truth that our Holy Father, the Pope, is thy Vicar and Representative; and that in obeying Him in matters of religion, they are obeying Thee, so that as there is but one holy company in heaven above, so likewise there may be but one communion, confessing and glorifying Thy holy Name here below.

       Hmmmm....  I'm not quite sure what to do with  urlLink  this article  by  urlLink  Mr. Cork.   This paragraph in particular threw me for a bit of a loop. "Campus ministry is ministry to a unique and distinct culture. It is ministry to a culture that above all prizes the quest for truth, goodness and beauty; a culture that transmits the wisdom from the past, but is never satisfied with it; a culture that draws strength from and which feeds all disciplines, all ethnic groups, all nations, all creeds. It is a culture that seeks to form the entire person, so that that person can be an agent of change in a rapidly changing global society. " I'm afraid I'm a lot less sanguine about the university community. A lot of the folks who are in charge at the modern secular university would deny that truth, goodness and beauty exist as objective facts, let alone that they prize them. And drawing strength from all creeds ? Try to draw on the moral teachings of traditional Judaism and Christianity on the sanctity of unborn human life and see how far you get.  On the other hand there are some excellent insights as well, my favorite being his comment that campus ministry demands "a great ability to balance, infinite patience, and a sense of humor. " Also, the accompanying picture of the Venerable biases me in its favor, as it illustrates something I am hoping for and  urlLink  pray for every day .  (See Item 10.)   So I'm both appreciative and a bit perturbed by the piece.  And why,  why  does it have to refer to the late Fr. de Chardin ?

       From  Loss and Gain , by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  In which Willis, recently received into the Church, comments upon the Mass.... "To me nothing is so consoling, so piercing, so thrilling, so overcoming, as the Mass, said as it is among us. I could attend Masses for ever and not be tired. It is not a mere form of words,  it is a great action, the greatest action that can be on earth. It is, not the invocation merely, but, if I dare use the word, the evocation of the Eternal. He becomes present on the altar in flesh and blood, before whom angels bow and devils tremble. This is that awful event which is the scope, and is the interpretation, of every part of the solemnity. Words are necessary, but as means, not as ends; they are not mere addresses to the throne of grace, they are instruments of what is far higher, of consecration, of sacrifice."

       Hymn for Vespers- Wednesday   Translated by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Cli Deus sanctissime .   O LORD, who, thron'd in the holy height,      Through plains of ether didst diffuse          The dazzling beams of light,              In soft transparent hues;   Who didst, on the fourth day, in heaven      Light the fierce cresset of the sun,          And the meek moon at even,              And stars that wildly run;   That they might mark and arbitrate      'Twixt alternating night and day,          And tend the train sedate              Of months upon their way;   Clear, Lord, the brooding night within,      And clean these hearts for Thy abode,          Unlock the spell of sin,              Crumble its giant load.   Grant it, O Father, Only Son,      And Holy Spirit, God of grace,          To whom all praise be done              In every time and place.

       I was going through my files...  my actual, 'hard copy' files of old newspaper articles, and came across this interesting piece by Fr. Mark Gruber, O.S.B., whom I have met and have heard lecture. It was published in  Our Sunday Visitor  August 11, 1996. After several searches, I did not find it anywhere online, so I am posting it here.   Facing up to a schism  If any serious watchers of Catholicism doubt that the Church is profoundly fragmented and morally obliged to provide canonical recognition of the fact, they are either ostrich-like and cannot bear the pain of acknowledgement, or they have an agenda to obscure the breach so that they can better conduct their divisive behavior, or they hope that the surpression of institutional awareness and response will permit time to bury the problem. But the time has come to canonically face the moral fact of schism. To those who feel that it is just too painful to acknowledge the matter, let them be reminded that preferring ignorance to sober truth is the saddest human condition of all. To those who prefer denial in order to make further inroads into the faithful, let them be reminded that the moral high ground goes to the side that sacrifices strategy for integrity. To those who wish to indefinitely postpone the split in order to give dissidents time to retire or reconcile, let them be reminded that this tactic has reached the point of diminishing returns. The hesitation to name the schism has only served to leave the majority of the faithful flock vunerable to canonically clothed wolves. Strip the predators of their juridical link to the Church, which they have already spiritually repudiated, and the faithful can better discern the mind of Christ. In fact, a strategic reason exists to act expeditiously to make explicit the Church's true condition. The generation still endures that remember the beauty of a Catholicism that was Roman. So long as that generation holds the balance of ecclesiastical influence, any fundamental division of the Church will create a domino effect, whereby undecided speculators, hesitant dissidents, moderate critics and vast portions of the as-of-yet unpolarized lay people will ultimately find their way home to Rome. The ordinary gravity of inter-generational dialogue will pull the next generation (who otherwise has no great homing instinct for orthodoxy) into the clarity of spiritual decision. And the work of the Holy Spirit succeeds best in such moments of conscientious choice. The great majority of the faithful, while confused and often misled, is still on the fence of discerning their conviction of Church. By acting now to declare the reality of separation, most of them will still jump off the fence in the direction of the ancient faith.  If the Church fails to make manifest the reality of schism now,it will still occur-as well it must, given the profound nature of the divisive attitudes, beliefs and actions in institutionally entrenched groups. But when it does occur, the generation that can best orient the faithful will be diminished sufficently to leave the majority of the would-be faithful adrift. Instead of a schism in which the Church recovers her direction and moves ahead with renewed vigor, with most of her institutions intact and primed for new growth, she will be incomparably smaller, much the size and cast of a biblical remnant.  Those who depart the ranks of the Church in either case have an even more bleak prognosis. Essentially being indistinguishable from liberal moribund Protestantism on issues ranging from biblical authority, sexuality, the sanctity of life and even the nature of God Himself, they will have no reason for an independent ecclesiastical existence. Most will be absorbed into some Anglican amalgam, and the few who attempt to hold out as a sect will discover that they have such a habit of rebellion to authority that their 'new church' will simply splinter into oblivion.  No wonder they prefer to linger in the present moment of ecclesiastical denial. So long as they stay within the canonical boundaries of the institution, they're somebodies. They matter. But once they are recognized as no longer being among us, they will be out in the dust of Gnosticism and a hundred other old fossils of Church history. A telling lesson of history was the salvaging of the U.S. banks after the onset of the Great Depression. After so many banks defaulted, people began to withdraw their savings in fear of total collapse. Acting wisely, the president established a commission to investigate the practices and policies of all banks, accrediting the great majority of them, and backing them with government guarantees. On a ccount of the few that were not accredited, confidence-and cash-flowed back to the many that were. The parallels to the Church are obvious: the confidence of the majority is shaken, and their moral investment in the Church is diminishing. Greater clarity about the worst abuses, and separating them from the Church's ordinary life, will restore confidence and trust. Can we afford not to be so decisive in this crucial hour ?

        I've never been much of a fan of Mark Twain....  and  urlLink  this  doesn't help. Politics aside, (I'm rather ambivalent on the Iraq situation) the man has a singularly inapt quote. As the invocation, he has: "God the all-terrible!  Thou who ordainest!  Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword! " I happen to be familiar with those lines. They are a slight misquote of the beginning of a hymn which we sing here on a regular basis: "God the Omnipotent ! King Who ordainest/  Thunder Thy clarion, the lightning Thy sword/  Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest/   Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.   "  Hardly lines from a sabre-rattler, don't you think ?

       Today, January 15th...  is the feast of  urlLink  St. Macarius of Egypt.   Also, on this date back in 1994, Fr. David Abernethy of the Pittsburgh Oratory was ordained to the priesthood.  Ad multos annos , Fr. David !  Fr. David's ordination day was especially memorable because it was probably the coldest day I've ever experienced in my life. The Cathedral's heating isn't great at the best of times, and when it's 14 below zero outside (real temperature, not 'wind chill' )... well, let's just say that everybody who could kept on their coats and their boots !  And that marble floor must have been freezing.....  Prayers for Fr. David would be appreciated, and also prayers for Fr. Bryan, whose father is in the hospital with a serious illness.

       The Venerable Newman, on St. Philip and Purity  Philip's Purity Philip, well knowing the pleasure which God takes in cleanness of heart, had no sooner come to years of discretion, and to the power of distinguishing between good and evil, than he set himself to wage war against the evils and suggestions of his enemy, and never rested till he had gained the victory. Thus, notwithstanding he lived in the world when young, and met with all kinds of persons, he preserved his virginity spotless in those dangerous years of his life.  No word was ever heard from his lips which would offend the most severe modesty, and in his dress, his carriage, and countenance, he manifested the same beautiful virtue.  One day, while he was yet a layman, some profligate persons impudently tempted him to commit sin. When he saw that flight was impossible, he began to speak to them of the hideousness of sin and the awful presence of God. This he did with such manifest distress, such earnestness, and such fervour, that his words pierced their abandoned hearts as a sword, and not only persuaded them to give up their horrible thought, but even reclaimed them from their evil ways.  At another time some bad men, who are accustomed to think no one better than themselves, invited him on some pretext into their house, under the belief that he was not what the world took him to be; and then, having got possession of him, thrust him into a great temptation. Philip, in this strait, finding the doors locked, knelt down and began to pray to God with such astonishing fervour and heartfelt heavenly eloquence, that the two poor wretches who were in the room did not dare to speak to him, and at last themselves left him and gave him a way to escape.  His virginal purity shone out of his countenance. His eyes were so clear and bright, even to the last years of his life, that no painter ever succeeded in giving the expression of them, and it was not easy for anyone to keep looking on him for any length of time, for he dazzled them like an Angel of Paradise.  Moreover, his body, even in his old age, emitted a fragrance which, even in his decrepit old age, refreshed those who came near him; and many said that they felt devotion infused into them by the mere smell of his hands.  As to the opposite vice. The ill odour of it was not to the Saint a mere figure of speech, but a reality, so that he could detect those whose souls were blackened by it; and he used to say that it was so horrible that nothing in the world could equal it, nothing, in short, but the Evil Spirit himself. Before his penitents began their confession he sometimes said, "O my son, I know your sins already."  Many confessed that they were at once delivered from temptations by his merely laying his hands on their heads. The very mention of his name had a power of shielding from Satan those who were assailed by his fiery darts.  He exhorted men never to trust themselves, whatever experience they might have of themselves, or however long their habits of virtue.  He used to say that humility was the true guard of chastity; and that not to have pity for another in such cases was a forerunner of a speedy fall in ourselves; and that when he found a man censorious, and secure of himself, and without fear, he gave him up for lost.  Prayer Philip, my glorious Patron, who didst ever keep unsullied the white lily of thy purity, with such jealous care that the majesty of this fair virtue beamed from thine eyes, shone in thy hands, and was fragrant in thy breath, obtain for me that gift from the Holy Ghost, that neither the words nor the example of sinners may ever make any impression on my soul. And, since it is by avoiding occasions of sin, by prayer, by keeping myself employed, and by the frequent use of the Sacraments that my dread enemy must be subdued, gain for me the grace to persevere in these necessary observances. - From "Novena of St. Philip", in    Meditations and Devotions

       Oh, no, here we go again....  The promoters of sexual perversion are  urlLink  trying to co-opt Tolkien .  urlLink  Mr. Shea   and  urlLink  Mr. Lams   have good comments to make on this. I was disappointed, but not surprised, that the actors 'played along'. Par for the course in today's Hollywood. It's from a secular perspective, but the classic article on the topic is  urlLink  And in the Closet Bind Them  by Quickbeam over at  urlLink TheOneRing.Net .  Sad though it is that people have this bizarre need to give fictional characters sexual twistedness, it's only to be expected. After all, the same types do this with historical people who are safely dead and unable to defend themselves. ( I once thumbed though a library book in which the clueless author speculated that  St. Philip Neri  was 'gay'. After all, he had a lot of young, male followers. They couldn't really have been drawn to his holiness- it must have been a secret homosexual clique.I've never defaced a library book, but in this case I was severely tempted ! )  I do have great respect for those who deal with having those particular temptations and overcome them by the grace of God. It must be a terrible cross to bear, particularly in this insane society, and particularly now that there are even those who claim to represent the Church who urge those so tempted to give in. But I'm afraid it's difficult to have much respect for those who drag reputations into the mud without a shred of solid evidence.

         The Feast of St. Hilary of Poitiers  known as "the Athanasius of the West" is today. Information on him can be found  urlLink  here .  "Catholic theologians met this difficulty, both before and after the Nicene Council, by insisting on the unity of origin, which they taught as existing in the Divine Triad, the Son and Spirit having a communicated divinity from the Father, and a personal unity with Him; the Three Persons being internal to the Divine Essence, unlike the polytheism of the Greeks and Romans, the tritheism of Marcion and the Manichees, and the Archical Hypostases of Plotinus. Thus Hippolytus says: "I say, 'Another,' not two Gods, but as light from light, as water from a spring, or a ray from the sun." And Hilary, in the fourth century, confirms him, saying, "The Father does not lose His attribute of being the One God, because the Son also is God, for the Son is God from God, One from One, therefore One God, because God from Himself."  De Trin. iv. 15.   "- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Tracts Theological and Ecclesiastical

       Finally getting around to this...  A few words on the Ordination reception and Fr. Michael's First Mass... The reception was great, except for the fact that Fr. Drew was feeling poorly and while he was at the ordination itself, he wasn't up to attending the reception. There were lots of interesting people there, including some I hadn't seen in several years, and some I had never met before. I spoke with Fr. Daniels, the Provost of the Pharr Oratory down in Texas, and I mentioned a comment made by the brilliant Msgr. Ronald Knox, that though he had met many Oratorians in his life, he couldn't name any one as being 'typical'.  "Of course." Fr. Daniels replied with a laugh."That's because we're all a little crazy !"  Well, who am  I  to argue with  a Provost ?  The First Mass was very moving. It was the Feast of the Holy Family, and the point I remember best from the homily was that while God blessed family life with fruitfulness from the very beginning, in the Holy Family it is seen that now virginity and chastity are fruitful as well. "In Our Lady's complete surrender of herself to God, she became the mother of Christ, and, though Him, the mother of the Church, and of all Christians. "  My friend Angela, who couldn't come to the ordination, did make it to the First Mass. I hadn't seen much of her lately, as she is a postulant  urlLink  here . She is scheduled to be clothed as a novice this month. Prayers would be appreciated, of course.

       Amy Welborn nails it  with  urlLink  her post   on the way pro-life folks are expected to behave, as opposed to abortion supporters. (Direct link not working correctly, so some scrolling may be necessary) Here's the beginning.   Over the past week, weve been advised time and time again that both sides need to approach the issue of abortion with reason, calm and as little emotion as possible. Translation: Pro-lifers, shut up.   For you see, its okay for pro-choice advocates (See? I can do it? Only once, though, I think) to throw around selective statistics, present false accounts of history and mischaracterize and stereotype their opponents, but let a prolifer say the words baby or kill and let the clucking begin.......

       Day of Mourning  Thirty years ago, on this date, the members of the Supreme Court of the United States (with several honorable exceptions) legalized the slaughter of children in the womb from conception to birth. (Actually, this license stretches slightly beyond the beginning of separation from the mother. A child may be taken from the womb feet first, with the head remaining inside the mother, his/her skull may be punctured with surgical scissors, and his/her brain may be sucked out, without the law saying anything about such an utter monstrosity.)   urlLink This   urlLink  anniversary   urlLink of    urlLink horror   urlLink  is    urlLink  being    urlLink  remembered   urlLink  with    urlLink  sorrow    urlLink  all   urlLink  over    urlLink  the    urlLink  Catholic    urlLink Blogosphere  ,  urlLink  and    urlLink  it   urlLink  certainly    urlLink  should   urlLink  be  .  urlLink  Our    urlLink nation   urlLink  is    urlLink  stained    urlLink  with   urlLink  innocent   urlLink  blood .  urlLink   Kyrie  ,  urlLink  eleison  .

At the Pittsburgh Oratory, besides mourning the loss of the butchered children, we are also mourning with one of our own in his personal loss. Fr. Bryan's father passed away early this morning. Prayers for the repose of his soul and the comfort of his family in their loss would be a great help.

       The Feast of St. Agnes, Virgin and Martyr  is today. One can find information on her  urlLink  here . There are also posts on her at  urlLink  A Catholic Point of View ,  urlLink  Dappled Things  ,  urlLink  Catholic Light ,  and  urlLink  The New Gasparian .   "Take that holy child, the blessed St. Agnes, who, at the age of thirteen, resolved to die rather than deny the faith, and stood enveloped in an atmosphere of purity, and diffused around her a heavenly influence, in the very home of evil spirits into which the heathen brought her; or consider the angelical Aloysius, of whom it hardly is left upon record that he committed even a venial sin; or St. Agatha, St. Juliana, St. Rose, St. Casimir, or St. Stanislas, to whom the very notion of any unbecoming imagination had been as death; well, there is not one of these seraphic souls but might have been a degraded, loathsome leper, except for God's grace, an outcast from his kind; not one but might, or rather would, have lived the life of a brute creature, and died the death of a reprobate, and lain down in hell eternally in the devil's arms, had not God put a new heart and a new spirit within him, and made him what he could not make himself." - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

        You've heard of Judge Learned Hand ? Well, meet Judge White Hand...   urlLink  Unbelievable .  Perhaps it was a case of mistaken identity, but the priest was acting in an attempt to defend the Eucharist from desecration. That deserves applause, not condemnation. And what planet is this judge from, anyway, that she thinks she has the right to say who receives the Eucharist ?  Also, I wonder if the media would cover someone being refused Communion because he or she insisted on kneeling in order to receive ?    What's saddest of all.... a  bishop  siding with these people. Yes, I have learned to expect the worst from Bishop Gumbleton, but still....

       The Feast of St. John Bosco  is today.There is information on him  urlLink  here . I'm rather fond of him, as he reminds me of my own patron and founder St. Philip Neri. This quote in particular is very Philippian :    Enjoy yourself as much as you like -- if only you keep from sin.  Saint John Bosco    This reminds me of St. Philip's famous rejoinder to one of his older followers ( I believe it was Venerable Caesar Baronius), when the latter complained that the teenagers who hung around the Oratory were too noisy and boisterous. "As long as they keep away from sin, I wouldn't mind if they chopped wood on my back !"

       Catholic nerdiness, redux  A few more examples.... When a friend comes back from a trip to Europe, the first thing you ask is what shrines he visited. You tend to think of cities in Europe in terms of saints and places associated with them, not regular tourist attractions. ("To heck with Buckingham Palace ! I want to see Tyburn !" )  I'm not sure if this one belongs more under "Catholic Nerd" or "Tolkien Geek"... You occasionally pray the Sign of the Cross in High Elven.

       'Christian Bookstores'   urlLink  Mrs. Kropp  comments on why 'Christian' bookstores don't carry Catholic materials.   . How come "Christian" stores don't include Catholic materials? Because they aren't "Christian" stores, they're Protestant.    That's mostly true, I'd say, except that the 'Christian' bookstores around here do sometimes carry a tiny smattering of Catholic materials. We're just too numerous to be ignored, I guess.  What really floored me once was when I walked into a 'Christian' bookstore to kill some time while waiting for a movie to start. I found no Catholic books at all- but I found a whole shelf of  Orthodox  materials. It included books defending icons, books arguing for the necessity of Sacred Tradition, and hefty tomes of the Fathers on "the Holy  Theotokos " . Hmm. I guess they figured as long as it isn't  Catholic  , it must be acceptable. (BTW, I did not inform the owners about just what they were carrying on their shelves !)

       The Sign of the Cross  Fine post over at  urlLink  Ad Orientem , on the Sign of the Cross. Here's a verse by the Venerable Newman on the topic.  The Sign of the Cross   Whene'er across this sinful flesh of mine  I draw the Holy Sign,  All good thoughts stir within me, and renew  Their slumbering strength divine;  Till there springs up a courage high and true  To suffer and to do.   And who shall say, but hateful spirits around,  For their brief hour unbound,  Shudder to see, and wail their overthrow?  While on far heathen ground  Some lonely Saint hails the fresh odour, though  Its source he cannot know.    Oxford. November 25, 1832.

       Saddened, confused, and troubled....  by this article :  urlLink  Tolkien son's child abuse shame   . I had heard about a while ago, but this article has far more disturbing details than anything I had seen before, making it seem somewhat more credible than the tiny, two-paragraph reports I have seen previously. Two things puzzle me though. First off, the newspaper claims that the reason it didn't publish about the story before was because they were threatened with a lawsuit. However, now that Fr. Tolkien is dead, the 'truth can be told'. Excuse me ? Does the fact of someone being dead mean that they are less protected by libel laws than the living ? Is this some peculiarity in the British legal system I haven't heard of ?  Secondly, I was also a bit put aback by the claim that while there was enough evidence to go to court, the matter was not pursued because Fr. Tolkien was too ill. Being sick means you won't get charged with child abuse ? The whole thing just doesn't jibe.  Of course, I know I'm not exactly impartial. This isn't the sort of thing one  wants  to believe about any priest, let alone one who also happened to be the eldest son of one's favorite author. And if it is true, the victims deserve as much sympathy as all abused innocents do. But something about it just doesn't completely convince me as yet.

       Yet more on Fr. White..oops, I mean Fr. Quinlan...  Good Lord, but does  urlLink  this priest  need prayer. And counsel. And a dressing-down by his bishop, though I've been told that's unlikely to happen.  I am annoyed by the headline of the  Virginian Pilot  article. "Fool for Christ" is a title used of St. Francis of Assisi and my own patron St. Philip Neri. Applying it to this disturbed soul cheapens it radically.

       Digging through the paper archives again   I found a handout sheet from a retreat  I went on years ago . I don't know who wrote it-the priest who led the retreat or someone else whose writing he found, but I think it's interesting. I'll be blogging a paragraph each time I have a computer available.  "One traditional model for the life of grace is that of the avoidance of the seven deadly cardinal or deadly sins and the pursuit of the seven cardinal virtues. Thus the fount of all sin, the sin of Adam and Eve, pride, is attacked with the recognition that we are not divine, but depend on God for all graces, even life itself. Therefore we need Him, and we need others. Vanity, arrogance, superiority, claiming to be indispensible, are all rejected in favor of humility, shown in being honest and realistic about ourselves- that we may be acceptable to God, but we are not yet as He wants us to be. Humility as the opposite of pride requires that our self-esteem does not blind us to our own faults or to the virtues of others. "

I agree that he should be the patron, though I disagree on some of her other points, and I'm not sure some of the facts are straight.

       For Friday   "6. A hand was lifted up against the Face of Christ. Whose hand was that? My conscience tells me: "thou art the man." I trust it is not so with me now. But, O my soul, contemplate the awful fact.  Fancy  Christ before thee, and  fancy   thyself lifting up thy hand and striking Him! Thou wilt say, "It is impossible: I could not do so." Yes, thou hast done so. When thou didst sin wilfully, then thou hast done so. He is beyond pain now: still thou hast struck Him, and had it been in the days of His flesh, He would have felt pain. Turn back in memory, and recollect the time, the day, the hour, when by wilful mortal sin, by scoffing at sacred things, or by profaneness, or by dark hatred of this thy Brother, or by acts of impurity, or by deliberate rejection of God's voice, or in any other devilish way known to thee, thou hast struck The All-holy One.  O injured Lord, what can I say? I am very guilty concerning Thee, my Brother; and I shall sink in sullen despair if Thou dost not raise me. I cannot look on Thee; I shrink from Thee; I throw my arms round my face; I crouch to the earth. Satan will pull me down if Thou take not pity. It is terrible to turn to Thee; but oh turn Thou me, and so shall  I be turned. It is a purgatory to endure the sight of Thee, the sight of myselfI most vile, Thou most holy. Yet make me look once more on Thee whom I have so incomprehensibly affronted, for Thy countenance is my only life, my only hope and health lies in looking on Thee whom I have pierced. So I put myself before Thee; I look on Thee again; I endure the pain in order to the purification.  O my God, how can I look Thee in the face when I think of my ingratitude, so deeply seated, so habitual, so immovableor rather so awfully increasing! Thou loadest me day by day with Thy favours, and feedest me with Thyself, as Thou didst Judas, yet I not only do not profit thereby, but I do not even make any acknowledgment at the time. Lord, how long? when shall I be free from this real, this fatal captivity? He who made Judas his prey, has got foothold of me in my old age, and I cannot get loose. It is the same day after day. When wilt Thou give me a still greater grace than Thou hast given, the grace to profit by the graces which Thou givest? When wilt Thou give me Thy effectual grace which alone can give life and vigour to this effete, miserable, dying soul of mine? My God, I know not in what sense I can pain Thee in Thy glorified state; but I know that every fresh sin, every fresh ingratitude I now commit, was among the blows and stripes which once fell on Thee in Thy passion. O let me have as little share in those Thy past sufferings as possible. Day by day goes, and I find I have been more and more, by the new sins of each day, the cause of them. I know that at best I have a real share  in solido  of them all, but still it is shocking to find myself having a greater and greater share. Let others wound Theelet not me. Let not me have to think that Thou wouldest have had this or that pang of soul or body the less, except for me. O my God, I am so fast in prison that I cannot get out. O Mary, pray for me. O Philip, pray for me, though I do not deserve pity. "  from   Meditations and Devotions , by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

       I missed an interesting anniversary  back on January 23. It was the anniversary of the day back in 1875 when a certain Anglican clergyman went to his reward. No, not a former Anglican clergyman-this one went to his grave as a member of the Church of England. While he claimed that, at one point, he had flirted a bit with High Church ideas, he later repudiated them violently. He was known for writing both essays and novels in which hearty Englishmen or Germans, whether pagan or Protestant, are depicted as the models of true virtue, while Latins, including some of the early Church Fathers, are shown as decadent and corrupt.  Now why would such a person interest me ? Because his name was Charles Kingsley, and in 1864 he wrote these words in an anonymus article in  Macmillan's Magazine .    "Truth, for its own sake, had never been a virtue with the Roman clergy. Father Newman informs us that it need not, and on the whole ought not to be; that cunning is the weapon which Heaven has given to the saints wherewith to withstand the brute male force of the wicked world which marries and is given in marriage. Whether his notion be doctrinally correct or not, it is at least historically so."   When the Venerable's attention was brought to this passage, he wrote to the magazine in question, stating that they surely would wish to correct so egregious a libel. Instead an  urlLink exchange of letters   ensued, culminating in Mr. Kingsley publishing a  urlLink  pamphlet  in which he not only refused to apologize, but increased his offensiveness ten times over.  Venerable Newman's response was, of course, the  urlLink   Apologia Pro Vita Sua  , his masterpiece, with which his reputation in England, and later his reputation in Rome, began to revive.  The Venerable's own comment upon Mr. Kingsley's death follows: 'As to Mr. Kingsley, much less could I feel any resentment against him when he was accidentally the instrument, in the good Providence of God, by whom I had an opportunity given me, which otherwise I should not have had, of vindicating my character and conduct in my "Apologia." I heard, too, a few years back from a friend that she chanced to go into Chester Cathedral and found Mr. K. preaching about me, kindly though, of course, with criticisms on me. And it has rejoiced me to observe lately that he was defending the Athanasian Creed, and, as it seemed to me, in his views generally nearing the Catholic view of things. I have always hoped that by good luck I might meet him, feeling sure that there would be no embarrassment on my part, and I said Mass for his soul as soon as I heard of his death. 'Most truly yours, JOHN H. NEWMAN.'

       Reason to rejoice   The choir is rehearsing again tonight and singing again on Sunday, after a hiatus of two weeks. We were off while the University in its wisdom decided to replace the cork under the flooring in Heinz Chapel. (Why couldn't they have done this in the  summer , when the number of people attending our Sunday Mass at noon is considerably smaller ? ) The noon Mass was celebrated in an auditorium (provided by same University) across the street for the past two Sundays. The acoustics in the place were so dismal our choir director decided to let us have a short break until the Chapel was available again.

Yes,   The Silmarillion  gives you a  lot  more insight into the Elven character than you get in  The Lord of the Rings . Tolkien's Elves are beautiful, and have amazing abilities, but they are  not  all sweetness and light !  Of course, as someone who has a bit of a Fëanor fixation, I'm more aware of this than most....

       Even trolls can have a point  No,  I'm not talking Tolkienian trolls, but the Internet-type. There's a certain one who has apparently taken to haunting comment boxes on certain blogs. He seems to be a evangelistic atheist person, with a particular axe to grind against those teachings on sexual morality which are out of step with current culture. Most of the opinions he expresses are, to put it bluntly, drivel. However, this one post made me seriously uncomfortable.     Orthodox Catholics are a small minority of American Catholics. Most American Catholics dissent from Church teaching in all sorts of ways--on contraception, on divorce, on abortion, on the ordination of women, on the celibacy requirement for priests, and so on. The more orthodox the Catholic Church becomes in America, the more it will drive these rank-and-file Catholics out of the Church. I get the impression that that's what many of you orthodox types want, anyway.   I think he's generalizing a bit, and also mixing together issues of varying degrees of importance. (While I don't think the celibacy requirement for priests in the Latin Rite should be altered, it's not in the same category as the impossibilities of the Church ordaining women or allowing for the killing of unborn children.) However, part of me resonates with what he's saying. Lots of  times I hear or read of people calling themselves Catholic publicly dissenting, and I end up seething and wishing somebody would just kick them out for crying out loud !  Then I realize I'm not being charitable, I don't know what their formation was like, I'm letting my temper get the best of me, etc. This is particularly stinging for me to realize since my patron St. Philip was known for dealing kindly with everyone.  However, another part of me wonders if the Church might be better off smaller, stricter, but more faithful. We started out with the folks in the Upper Room, after all. Then again, I wonder if I'm indulging in sectarianism when I say that. (See the brilliant book  Enthusiasm  by Msgr. Ronald Knox.)  Yep, I'm confused. Need more prayer and counsel to sort this one out.

       Another reason not to like Mark Twain  I entered the first line of Phyllis McGinley's verse on St. Philip into the Google search engine, to see if it is online anywhere. ("When Phlip Neri walked abroad/Beside the Tiber, praising God...") It seems that that verse is not online, since the first result was a quote from Mr. Twain's  Innocents Abroad  , in which Mr. Twain mocked  urlLink  St. Philip's Pentecost experience , saying that he wondered what Philip had had for dinner.  Apparently the smug materialists around nowadays are nothing new...

       Flags at half-mast all over today  The Oratory's flags (American and Papal)  included.....    For the Dead  (A Hymn.)    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  Help, Lord, the souls which Thou hast made,  The souls to Thee so dear,  In prison for the debt unpaid  Of sins committed here.   Those holy souls, they suffer on,   Resign'd in heart and will,  Until Thy high behest is done,  And justice has its fill.  For daily falls, for pardon'd crime,  They joy to undergo  The shadow of Thy cross sublime,  The remnant of Thy woe.   Help, Lord, the souls which Thou hast made,  The souls to Thee so dear,  In prison for the debt unpaid Of sins committed here.    Oh, by their patience of delay,  Their hope amid their pain,  Their sacred zeal to burn away  Disfigurement and stain;  Oh, by their fire of love, not less  In keenness than the flame,  Oh, by their very helplessness,  Oh, by Thy own great Name,   Good Jesu, help! sweet Jesu, aid  The souls to Thee most dear,  In prison for the debt unpaid  Of sins committed here.

       Cool idea, not happy about the implementation..  The controversial Jesuit-focused blogger  urlLink  Not For Sheep  has posted a  urlLink  Litany of Jesuit Saints  on her blog. Another Jesuit-focused blogger,  urlLink  Disordered Affections , has a  urlLink  post    complaining about the same. While I rather like the idea of a litany of saints from a particular community, this one indulges in random 'canonization' of people whose causes have never even been introduced, and several names included are, IMHO, scandalous. It's bad enough we're often 'canonizing' people at their funeral Masses without this sort of thing.  That said, I'm thinking of writing a Litany of Oratorian Saints, but with only those who have been declared Saint, Blessed, or Venerable in my list. Unfortunately, finding material in English on the Oratorian Beati and Venerabili can be like pulling teeth...sigh...  Since I'm only including those I know something about, this means it will be a short litany !

       Two days late, but at least I'm not two dollars short..  My answers to the Friday Five... 1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?    I don't remember properly. I think it might have been Spiderman, because he seems to have been more angst-ridden than some of the others. None of the female superheroine impressed me much. And of course, I read  The Lord of the Rings  for the first time when I was 10, and  The Silmarillion  when I was 12. Who needs Wonder Woman when you've got Éowyn and Lúthien ?   2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?     I wanted to not be pestered by the other kids. Never happened until my freshman year of college.  3. What's the furthest from home you've been?     Macon, Georgia. For a wedding.   4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?     It hasn't been always, but I have wanted to learn Cymraeg (Welsh) for a while. Haven't gotten to it.   5. What are your plans for the weekend?      10 am Mass Saturday, watching the desk at the Oratory Saturday afternoon, noon Mass Sunday, Vespers and Benediction Sunday evening.

       The Feast of the Presentation of the Lord in the Temple  is today. This is also known as Candlemas. I believe that in the old calendar Lent was preceded by several other penitential weeks, so that in most years, Candlemas was followed by the beginning of preparation for Lent.   Candlemas by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    (A Song.)   THE Angel-lights of Christmas morn,  Which shot across the sky,  Away they pass at Candlemas,  They sparkle and they die.   Comfort of earth is brief at best,  Although it be divine;  Like funeral lights for Christmas gone,  Old Simeon's tapers shine.   And then for eight long weeks and more,  We wait in twilight grey,  Till the high candle sheds a beam  On Holy Saturday.   We wait along the penance-tide  Of solemn fast and prayer;  While song is hush'd, and lights grow dim  In the sin-laden air.   And while the sword in Mary's soul  Is driven home, we hide  In our own hearts, and count the wounds  Of passion and of pride.   And still, though Candlemas be spent  And Alleluias o'er,  Mary is music in our need,  And Jesus light in store.    The Oratory. 1849.

       Seventh (and last) paragraph  from the handout. "Lastly, the sin of lust is, like gluttony, the result of a disorderly animal appetite, through which the person becomes over-concerned with sexual saitsfaction, so that his sexual desire demands a higher place in his life than his desire for God. As such, it is a form of selfishness which operates on the level of physical gratification to the detriment of all else, including the feelings and needs of others. The opposite virtue is chastity, that practical expression of the holiness of our bodies by the right use of our sexual desires, kept within the ordering of our vocations, be it to marriage or to the single state. This virtue is to be sought as the means of bringing into its proper place in God's scheme of things this particular aspect of our humanity so that it contributes constructively to the whole reordering of our lives around the service of God and neighbor.

       Sixth paragraph  from the handout. "Gluttony is the sin that flows from a disorderly animal appetite, the obsession with food and drink to the pont of living to eat, rather than eating to live. This failure in proportion is countered by temperance, a sensible and unexciting virtue which is essential to a balanced and worthwhile life because it frees us from excess in order to give us room to work energetically for God.

       A set of Saints who deserve better commemoration than the hedonism with which our culture soils their day...  Information on the Sts. Valentine can be found  urlLink  here   ,  urlLink  here  , and  urlLink  here  .  Here's a bit of verse, written by the Venerable Newman, apparently for the small daughter of a friend.   Valentine to a Little Girl     Little maiden, dost thou pine  For a faithful Valentine?  Art thou scanning timidly  Every face that meets thine eye?  Art thou fancying there may be  Fairer face than thou dost see?  Little maiden, scholar mine,  Wouldst thou have a Valentine?   Go and ask, my little child,  Ask the Mother undefiled:  Ask, for she will draw thee near,  And will whisper in thine ear:  "Valentine! the name is good;   For it comes of lineage high,  And a famous family:  And it tells of gentle blood,  Noble blood,and nobler still,  For its owner freely pour'd  Every drop there was to spill  In the quarrel of his Lord.  Valentine! I know the name,  Many martyrs bear the same;  And they stand in glittering ring  Round their warrior God and King,   Who before and for them bled,  With their robes of ruby red,  And their swords of cherub flame."   Yes! there is a plenty there,  Knights without reproach or fear,  Such St. Denys, such St. George,  Martin, Maurice, Theodore,  And a hundred thousand more;  Guerdon gain'd and warfare o'er,  By that sea without a surge,  And beneath the eternal sky,  And the beatific Sun,  In Jerusalem above,  Valentine is every one;  Choose from out that company  Whom to serve, and whom to love.

       Fifth paragraph  from the handout "Sloth, the bosom companion of covetousness, is seen as the failure of the will to work purposefully and constructively for God.  It is a mean sin which could not care less about others when there is no obvious and immediate personal gratification. The only antidote is perserverance, the willingness and effort to remain aware of others and open-hearted towards them, even and especially when there is nothing to be gained for the self. Perseverance is the way the selfish laziness of the will is overcome throught persistent acts of charity towards others and acts of devotion towards God. "

       St. Philip story...just because  St. Philip Neri was less than enthusiastic about physical mortifications. While he did incorporate them in his life to a certain extent, he saw mortification of the will as being both more important and less spiritually dangerous.  A follower of the saint, ( I believe his name was Bartolomeo) kept pestering Philip to permit him to wear a hairshirt. (Somehow I doubt that this is a problem for many superiors nowadays !) Philip kept saying no, until one day, in a moment of either exasperation or inspiration, he replied, yes, you can wear the hairshirt. In fact, I am requiring you to wear the hairshirt- on  top  of your other clothes !  Let's just say Bartolomeo ended up with more mortification than he planned on !

       Fourth paragraph  from the handout. "Covetousness, commonly called idolatry by St. Paul, is also to be rejected. It is a debased desire for things as the source of happiness. This consuming vice is the misuse of God's good creation to provide us with material possessions to support our self-esteem and to provoke our neighbors to envy. It soon burns up our love for God and turns it into a love for things, thus making an idol out of what God has given us of His creation. The cure for covetousness is generosity, to 'give and not to count the cost.' Love of neighbor as well as love of God should show itself in the stewardship of our resources, turning our material benefits into a means of blessing for others and an expression of our dedication to God."

       For the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes   Mary is the "Virgo Purissima," the Most Pure Virgin  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   By the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin is meant the great revealed truth that she was conceived in the womb of her mother, St. Anne, without original sin.  Since the fall of Adam all mankind, his descendants, are conceived and born in sin. "Behold," says the inspired writer in the Psalm Miserere"Behold, I was conceived in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me". That sin which belongs to every one of us, and is ours from the first moment of our existence, is the sin of unbelief and disobedience, by which Adam lost Paradise. We, as the children of Adam, are heirs to the consequences of his sin, and have forfeited in him that spiritual robe of grace and holiness which he had given him by his Creator at the time that he was made. In this state of forfeiture and disinheritance we are all of us conceived and born; and the ordinary way by which we are taken out of it is the Sacrament of Baptism.  But Mary never was in this state; she was by the eternal decree of God exempted from it. From eternity, God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, decreed to create the race of man, and, foreseeing the fall of Adam, decreed to redeem the whole race by the Son's taking flesh and suffering on the Cross. In that same incomprehensible, eternal instant, in which the Son of God was born of the Father, was also the decree passed of man's redemption through Him. He who was born from Eternity was born by an eternal decree to save us in Time, and to redeem the whole race; and Mary's redemption was determined in that special manner which we call the Immaculate Conception. It was decreed, not that she should be cleansed from sin, but that she should, from the first moment of her being, be preserved from sin; so that the Evil One never had any part in her. Therefore she was a child of Adam and Eve as if they had never fallen; she did not share with them their sin; she inherited the gifts and graces (and more than those) which Adam and Eve possessed in Paradise. This is her prerogative, and the foundation of all those salutary truths which are revealed to us concerning her. Let us say then with all holy souls,  Virgin most pure, conceived without original sin, Mary, pray for us.

       Third paragraph  from the handout... "Anger, the sister of envy, is to be resisted as an unworthy adjunct of pride, feeding as it does on the resentment of envy until the violence inherent in envy breaks out in physical and emotional cruelty, psychological pain, rage, assaults and even murder, the viciousness of the tongue, insulting, abusing, cursing and swearing to inflict damage, and many other terrible combinations of hatred, including hatred at a social level producing war, civil strife, and dissention. Such anger should be rejected in favor of meekness, that gentlest of virtues, which does not mean being a milk-sop, but being obedient to the will of God for peace. Meekness requires the courage to promote harmony out of strife, reconciliation out of emnity, communion out of dissention, agreement out of conflict. It means standing firm for God, for peace, and as such not return blow for blow."

'Peterborough', usually fairly reasonable, did him the doubtful honour of a peculiarly misrepresentative and asinine paragraph in the Daily Telegraph of Tuesday last. It began 'Asetic Mr. Lewis' - !!  I ask you !  He put away three pints in a very short session we had this morning, and said he was 'going short for Lent.'  "

"Envy, the product of insecurity brought on by pride, is to be rejected because it bears grudges against others, produces intolerance, bigotry, prejudice, using the lie and the smear to destroy the good work and the good name of others, creating jealousy with its demands for rights, advantages, status. In contrast, love is inculcated in the soul as the means of reducing envy and of growing in self-sacrifice, self-giving dedication to the good, the benefit, the welfare of others.

       Yes, another quiz is making the rounds..  Here's my result.         I am  heroic couplets ; most precise And fond of order. Planned and structured. Nice. I know, of course, just what I want; I know, As well, what I will do to make it so. This doesn't mean that I attempt to shun Excitement, entertainment, pleasure, fun; But they must keep their place, like all the rest; They might be good, but ordered life is best.     What Poetry Form Are You?        It also said that if I weren't heroic couplets, I'd be blank verse.    If I remember correctly, heroic couplets was the verse form the Professor used in his unfinished "The Lay of Leithian" and "The Lay of Leithian, Recommenced", in which he told the tale of Beren and Lúthien, the part of the  Silmarillion  which quite probably was the closest to his heart.

       The Feast of the Chair of St. Peter   is today. There is information on the feast  urlLink  here  .  The homily today was, of course, on the See of Peter as God-given source of unity. Among other points in his homily, Fr. Bryan mentioned that this  was important in his own conversion to Catholicism.   "So it is; the course of ages has fulfilled the prophecy and promise, 'Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.' That which in substance was possessed by the Nicene Hierarchy, that the Pope claims now. I do not wish to put difficulties in my way: but I cannot conceal or smooth over what I believe to be a simple truth, though the avowal of it will be very unwelcome to Protestants, and, as I fear, to some Catholics.

       From the growing Things are Getting Even Worse Across the Pond department  Mr. Shea and various others have posted  urlLink  this link  . Apparently, the British Government is taking the Clintonian position: this sort of thing isn't  really  sex. Therefore, they un-reason, why shouldn't the kids have all the fun they want ? I was reminded of something the inimitable Fr. Neuhaus wrote in   urlLink  First Things   , all the way back in 1998.   Britains New Labor government has a few tried and failed ideas of its own. Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Seminary in Louisville, brings to my attention that Her Majestys Government promoted a first-ever Sexual Awareness Week. An official explained, "Young people are less likely to have early sex if there is good communication about the subject at home. We are emphasizing that sex is fun and talking is the key to a healthy sex life." Right. "Its really fun, kids, so dont do it." I cant help thinking that its a sad commentary on the younger generation when they have to be instructed to take an interest in sex. Whats really interesting, however, is the assertion that talking is the key to the thing. "Brits do it verbally." Its downright kinky.

       From the homily  Fr. David celebated the noon Mass today. What struck me most in the homily was his remark that, like many of the people in the readings from Genesis this past week, we let ourselves be caught up in illusions fostered by the sin of pride. We each try to make our own little universe centered around our own desires. Christ, on the other hand, is Reality. Through His teaching, but even more through the Cross, and most of all, through Him coming to us, Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity, we are given the grace and strength to dismiss these illusions and live for Him.

        Happy Birthday, Venerable !  "John Henry Newman was born in Old Broad Street in the City of London on February 21, 1801, and was baptized in the church of St. Benet Fink on April 9 of the same year. His Father was a London banker, whose family came from Cambridgeshire. His Mother was of a French Protestant family, who left France for this country on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He was the eldest of six children, three boys and three girls. "  Autobiographical Memoir, Chapter One      urlLink  Lane Core  has a great set of links to commemorate the day.   As a birthday gift, I would request that, if they wish, readers would pray for his canonization. The following would work nicely.   Eternal Father, You led JOHN HENRY NEWMAN to follow the kindly light of Truth, and he obediently responded to your heavenly calls at any cost. As writer, preacher, counsellor and educator, as pastor, Oratorian, and servant of the poor he laboured to build up Your Kingdom.    Grant that through your Vicar on Earth we may hear the words, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter into the company of the canonized saints."    May You manifest Your servant's power of intercession by even extraordinary answers to the prayers of the faithful throughout the world. We pray particularly for our intentions in his name and in the Name of Jesus Christ Your Son our Lord.    Amen.    Please report any favours received to: The Postulator, The Oratory, Hagley Road, Birmingham B16 8UE, England

       For Thursday   Holy Communion by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    1. My God, who can be inhabited by Thee, except the pure and holy? Sinners may come to Thee, but to whom shouldst Thou come except to the sanctified? My God, I adore Thee as the Holiest; and, when Thou didst come upon earth, Thou didst prepare a holy habitation for Thyself in the most chaste womb of the Blessed Virgin. Thou didst make a dwelling place special for Thyself. She did not receive Thee without first being prepared for Thee; for from the moment that she was at all, she was filled with Thy grace, so that she never knew sin. And so she went on increasing in grace and merit year after year, till the time came, when Thou didst send down the Archangel to signify to her Thy presence within her. So holy must be the dwelling place of the Highest. I adore and glorify Thee, O Lord my God, for Thy great holiness.  2. O my God, holiness becometh Thy House, and yet Thou dost make Thy abode in my breast. My Lord, my Saviour, to me Thou comest, hidden under the semblance of earthly things, yet in that very flesh and blood which Thou didst take from Mary. Thou, who didst first inhabit Mary's breast, dost come to me. My God, Thou seest me; I cannot see myself. Were I ever so good a judge about myself, ever so unbiassed, and with ever so correct a rule of judging, still, from my very nature, I cannot look at myself, and view myself truly and wholly. But Thou, as Thou comest to me, contemplatest me. When I say,  Domine, non sum dignus "Lord, I am not worthy"Thou whom I am addressing, alone understandest in their fulness the words which I use. Thou seest how unworthy so great a sinner is to receive the One Holy God, whom the Seraphim adore with trembling. Thou seest, not only the stains and scars of past sins, but the mutilations, the deep cavities, the chronic disorders which they have left in my soul. Thou seest the innumerable living sins, though they be not mortal, living in their power and presence, their guilt, and their penalties, which clothe me. Thou seest all my bad habits, all my mean principles, all wayward lawless thoughts, my multitude of infirmities and miseries, yet Thou comest. Thou seest most perfectly how little I really feel what I am now saying, yet Thou comest. O my God, left to myself should I not perish under the awful splendour and the consuming fire of Thy Majesty. Enable me to bear Thee, lest I have to say with Peter, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!"   3. My God, enable me to bear Thee, for Thou alone canst. Cleanse my heart and mind from all that is past. Wipe out clean all my recollections of evil. Rid me from all languor, sickliness, irritability, feebleness of soul. Give me a true perception of things unseen, and make me truly, practically, and in the details of life, prefer Thee to anything on earth, and the future world to the present. Give me courage, a true instinct determining between right and wrong, humility in all things, and a tender longing love of Thee.

       Jeff Miller  has an  urlLink  interesting post  in which he comments on a  urlLink  certain professor  who is trying to press 'children's stories', in which he apparently includes  The Lord of the Rings . I'm less of a hawk than many at St. Blog's, but making arguments from a misreading of the Professor annoys me. Mr. Miller's comments are on the money. Appeasement is not really in the vocabulary in  The Lord of the Rings  . One of my favorite passages occurs when King Théoden of Rohan confronts Saruman after the battle of Helm's Deep.  (WARNING: A BIT OF A SPOILER !)      Saruman has been trying to get the King to come over to his side.  " 'But my lord of Rohan, am I to be called a murderer, because valiant man have fallen in battle ? If you go to war, needlessly, for I did not desire it, then men will be slain. But if I am a murderer on that account, then all the house of Eorl is stained with murder; for they have fought many wars, and have assailed many who defied them. Yet with some they have afterwards made peace, none the worse for being politic. I say, Théoden King : shall we have peace and friendship, you and I ? It is ours to command.'  ' We will have peace, ' said Théoden thickly and with an effort. Several of the Riders cried out gladly. Théoden held up his hand. 'Yes, we will have peace,' he said in a clear voice, 'we will have peace, when you and all your works have perished-and the works of your dark master to whom you would deliver us. You are a liar, Saruman, and a corrupter of men's hearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I perceive only a finger of the claw of Mordor. Cruel and cold ! Even if your war on me was just-as it was not, for were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and mine for your own profit as you desired-even so, what will you say of your torches in Westfold and the children that lie dead there ? And they hewed Háma's body before the gates of the Hornburg after he was dead. When you hang at a gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows, I will have peace with you and Orthanc.  So much for the House of Eorl. A lesser son of great sires am I, but I have no need to lick your fingers. Turn elsewhither. But I fear your voice has lost its charm.' " ("The Voice of Saruman",  The Two Towers   by J.R.R. Tolkien)  This is not to say that the Professor was unaware that war, even if it issues in victory, leaves wounds that are often unable to be healed. (He was, after all,  a veteran of WWI who lost some of his closest friends at the front.) Much of the end of  The Lord of the Rings  shows this. However, he was also aware that in certain situations, peace is simply not an option. The problem is deciding when that type of situation exists.

       Yet more bewilderment as I am overwhelmed with choices  Now people are posting  urlLink  favorite    urlLink  future     urlLink saints  . (Note: Direct link is not working on the last one-some scrolling may be required)   Well, my top spot is glaringly obvious... 1. Venerable John Henry Cardinal Newman, Founder of the Birmingham and London Congregations of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri  I pray for his canonization every day, attend a weekly Mass for that intention, and happily blog from his writings over and over. And I've met the postulator, the Very Reverend Paul Chavasse, C.O., currently Provost of the Birmingham Oratory and thus the Venerable's successor.    After that, things get a bit more tricky.   I could simply list the  urlLink  four    urlLink  current    urlLink  Oratorian   urlLink   beati   and leave it at that. But then there's all those wonderful Blessed and Venerable Martyrs of England and Wales. And the Blessed of the day, Fra Angelico. And Mother  Teresa. And Eve Lavalliere.  And Demetrius Gallitzin. And someone who will never be canonized because he wrote anonymusly, the author of  The Cloud of Unknowing ...

I mention him not only because I think his paintings some of the most lovely things this side of Heaven, but because some of his best work was done for the Dominicans of San Marco in Florence. Those particular friars were the ones who educated a young Florentine boy by the name of Filippo Neri....

       Guilty pleasures  A few of mine... Those cheeseburger links they sell at Sunoco stations "The Official Fanfiction University of Middle-earth" by Camilla Sandman Certain 80's music  and I even have a link to a guilty pleasure on the left:  urlLink  The Red Songbook of Westmarch  . A sample from that last.....  SAURON to the tune of GASTON from the Disney animated feature BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (as sung by the Witch-King of Angmar)  Sunday, November 28, 1999 by William H. Hsu  "I have still this to say... you do not know your peril!" 				- The Two Towers, Ch. 7 (Helm's Deep)  SCENE: The Barad-Dur, some years after the Quest of Erebor.  SAURON and    the WITCH-KING OF ANGMAR are taking afternoon tea on a platform near    the pinnacle.  "SAURON: Who do they think they are?!  The White Council has tangled    with the wrong Maia!  No one dares to assail Sauron! WITCH-KING: Heh, darn right! SAURON: Assaulted!  Thwarted!  Driven out of Dol Guldur!  Why, it's    more than I can bear! WITCH-KING: Er, more blood? SAURON: What for?  Nothing helps!  Without my Precious, I'm a Shadow    of my former self! WITCH-KING: Who, YOU?  Never!  Sauron, you've got to pull yourself    together...  WITCH-KING:    Gosh, it disturbs me to face you, Sauron    Though I'm the great Morgul-King    Every bad guy'd love to be you, Sauron    Even without the One Ring!    Where has the twinkle gone, oh my liege,    From your terrible Lidless Eye?    Everyone still fears and dreads it, Sauron    Not just Nine Mortal Men doomed to die!     No one's strong like Sauron    Sings fell songs like Sauron    And in snow-flinging no one's arm's long as Sauron's!    For there's no Lord of Darkness so evil    Twisted, abhorred, cruel, and foul    He makes those puny Balrogs look feeble    And he teaches these lost souls in Mordor to howl!  NAZGUL CHORUS:    No one prods like Sauron!    Plays "dark god" like Sauron! WITCH-KING:    No one stands up like a lightning rod like Sauron!  SAURON:    Numenor really fell for my machinations!  TROLLS:    My, what a guy, that Sauron!    Give five hurrahs, give twelve hip-hips! WITCH-KING:    Sauron makes the Elves flee Middle-earth in ships!  NAZGUL CHORUS:    No one's breath's like Sauron's    Preys on death like Sauron SHADE OF AR-PHARAZON:    No one brings on the Akallabeth like Sauron! ....... "

       I hold no brief for PETA  but it is discouraging that a network is trying to boost its ratings by  urlLink  subjecting animals to unnecessary degradation  .  At least when people degrade themselves on television, it's usually with their own consent.  I also resent the fact that  Fear Factor  made picking up domestic rats a test of courage, as if they were some type of dangerous wild beast. Even worse, apparently a lot of these ill-informed contestants picked up the baby rats by the tip of the tail. This is painful, and can lead to 'skinning' , in which the skin rips off of the tail, leaving it a bloody mess which has to be amputated to prevent infection.  One of my rats accidentally injured her tail, and about half of it had to be amputated. It was traumatic for both of us, and ever since then hearing about people who pick up rats by the tail makes me angry. Now if we were talking, say, puppies or kittens, it never would have happened....

       Went to a talk last night after Vespers...  given by Fr. Mark Gruber, O.S.B. I've mentioned him before, and  urlLink  blogged   a column he wrote some years back. Fr. Gruber is, obviously, a Benedictine monk and priest. He is also an anthropologist. Yes, I know that sounds like an odd combination, but it works very well. The topic was "The Role of Complementary Sexuality in the Revelation of Christian Faith."  I can't give a proper summary here, but I must say, if anybody has a chance to hear this priest speak, do. Here's a few highlights from Fr.'s talk. These are, of course, subject to my less-than-perfect memory, and any screw-ups are most probably mine. "Since God has become man, one could look at anthropology as a branch of divine science." "The secular West treats sexuality as something trival and incidental, and thus has no qualms about trying to flatten out the differences. Thus we give males Ritalin at a certain age, to get rid of masculine rambunctiousness, and females contraceptives at a certain age, to get rid of feminine fertility." " The biblical account does not say He made them rational and intelligent. It does not say He made them free and spontaneous, or emotional and expressive. All of those things are important, but they are not stressed in that first account of Creation. What the biblical account does say is that He made them, male and female.

        Against Thee only have I Sinned  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "1 . My God, I dare not offend any earthly superior; I am afraidfor I know I shall get into troubleyet I dare offend Thee. I know, O Lord, that, according to the greatness of the person offended against, the greater is the offence. Yet I do not fear to offend Thee, whom to offend is to offend the infinite God. O my dear Lord, how should I myself feel, what should I say of myself, if I were to strike some revered superior on earth? if I were violently to deal a blow upon some one as revered as a father, or a priest; if I were to strike them on the face? I cannot bear even to think of such a thingyet what is this compared with lifting up my hand against Thee? and what is sin but this? To sin is to insult Thee in the grossest of all conceivable ways. This then, O my soul! is what the sinfulness of sin consists in. It is lifting up my hand against my Infinite Benefactor, against my Almighty Creator, Preserver and Judgeagainst Him in whom all majesty and glory and beauty and reverence and sanctity centre; against the one only God.   2. O my God, I am utterly confounded to think of the state in which I lie! What will become of me if Thou art severe? What is my life, O my dear and merciful Lord, but a series of offences, little or great, against Thee! O what great sins I have committed against Thee before nowand how continually in lesser matters I am sinning! My God, what will become of me? What will be my position hereafter if I am left to myself! What can I do but come humbly to Him whom I have so heavily affronted and insulted, and beg Him to forgive the debt which lies against me? O my Lord Jesus, whose love for me has been so great as to bring Thee down from heaven to save me, teach me, dear Lord, my sinteach me its heinousnessteach me truly to repent of itand pardon it in Thy great mercy!  3. I beg Thee, O my dear Saviour, to recover me! Thy grace alone can do it. I cannot save myself. I cannot recover my lost ground. I cannot turn to Thee, I cannot please Thee, or save my soul without Thee. I shall go from bad to worse, I shall fall from Thee entirely, I shall quite harden myself against my neglect of duty, if I rely on my own strength. I shall make myself my centre instead of making Thee. I shall worship some idol of my own framing instead of Thee, the only true God and my Maker, unless Thou hinder it by Thy grace. O my dear Lord, hear me! I have lived long enough in this undecided, wavering, unsatisfactory state. I wish to be Thy good servant. I wish to sin no more. Be gracious to me, and enable me to be what I know I ought to be. "   Meditations and Devotions

       A bit of Oratory news, and a relic story   I mentioned that the Secular Oratory was getting a new member last night. Actually, there were two. (Where  was  my head yesterday ? ) So prayers for Pat as well as for Adam would be welcome.  Also, Fr. Wilfred Tighe recently went to his reward after 45 years as a member of the London Oratory. Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord....  As part of the ceremony last night, we were blessed with one of the Pittsburgh Oratory's three first-class relics of St. Philip Neri. This one is particularly interesting. Its reliquary is a small bronze bust of the saint. This relic once belonged to  urlLink  Pope St. Pius X  . He gave it to his friend,  urlLink  Rafael Cardinal Merry de Val  . Cardinal Merry de Val then passed it on to Fr. Charles Stephen Dessain, priest of the Birmingham Oratory and Newman scholar. Fr. Dessain then gave it to William Clancy, one of the founding members (and later a Provost) of the Pittsburgh Oratory, whose novitiate was made at the Birmingham Oratory. When he went to his reward, Fr. Clancy left the relic to Fr. Bryan, who happens to be the Father Prefect (i.e. the 'chaplain')  of the Secular Oratory here.  In a way, it's simultaneously a first-class relic (of St. Philip)  and    a second-class relic (of Pope St. Pius X)....

       Bill White  posted  urlLink  this very funny passage  from  urlLink   Loss and Gain   , one of the two novels by the Venerable.  This novel has an interesting story behind it. In 1847, Newman was sent a copy of a novel criticizing those members of the Oxford Movement who had been received into the Catholic Church . He had thought about writing something in response, but he was rather busy with establishing the Birmingham and London Oratories. However, he then heard of a married former Anglican clergyman named Burns who had been received into the Church. Burns was attempting to support himself by starting a Catholic publishing house. As a kindness to the struggling new publisher,  Newman, as a "name author", took time from his packed schedule to write  Loss and Gain , which he then offered to Burns to help launch his venture. ( I don't know if this Burns was the Burns of the famous Burns and Oates publishing house, but it would be likely, wouldn't it ? )  Anyway, it's an interesting read, moving in places, and, IMHO, quite funny in certain spots.  urlLink  This  chapter makes me smile every time I read it.

       St. Philip Neri quotes for Lent  " To mortify one's passion, no matter how small, is a greater help in the spiritual life than many abstinences and fasts." (Especially interesting coming from a man who, from the age of nineteen or so, ate no meat except when commanded to by his doctor, and who basically survived on one meal a day, consisting of a roll, a few vegetables, and water ...) "He who wishes to give himself up to prayer without mortification, is is like a bird wishing to fly before it is fledged." "To be without pity for other men's falls, is an evident sign that we shall fall ourselves shortly." "One of the very best means of obtaining humility, is sincere and frequent Confession. " "He who conceals a grave sin in Confession, is completely in the devil's hands. " "A man ought to mortify his understanding in little things, if he wishes easily to mortify it in great ones, and to advance in the way of virtue. "

       The Old Oligarch  has a link to an important article  urlLink  here  .  Taking this seriously would deprive a lot of folks of the satisfaction they get disguising their lack of generosity as concern for the world. (Yes, I know, not  all   couples with few children or none are lacking in generosity. I'm talking about the type who go up to mothers-of-many in supermarkets and make stupid remarks. "You're so selfish!" "Don't you care about the environment ?", etc. This has happened to friends of mine. )

       Eru help us all...   I've been checking out the mini-balrogs on  urlLink  Miss Cam's classic list  .  There are now twenty-seven Saruman-derived ones. Even minor characters are generating the critters. ("Alrohir"? "Ellandan" ? "Halabard"? ) More frightening still, there are ones derived from  Silmarillion  -related people and things. ("Thoronder " ? "Telpirion" ? "Maegin " ?  Worst of all, "Iluuvatar"- if you are going to use the Elvish name for God Almighty Himself, you could at least spell it correctly !)  "Treebread" is still the funniest, though....

       Cool !  According to the  urlLink  official website  ,  a new Congregation of the Oratory will be added to the Confederation on March 25. This one is in Prato, Italy, and will bring the number of Congregations in Italy to 19, and the number worldwide to 76.  They also have a little list of the other recently founded Congregations. Since the site is in Italian, I'll post the list here, in English: Nancy, France - (1995) Mexico City, Mexico- Our Lady of Peace - (1995) - (Mexico City is unusual in that it has 3 Congregations. Usually it's one to a city or town. ) São Paulo, Brazil - (1996) Ilsede, Germany - (1997) Maastricht, Holland - (1997) Oudtshoorn, South Africa - (1997) Metuchen, New Jersey, USA - (1998)  Poznan, Poland - (1999) Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA - (2000) Acicatena, Italy - (2002)   Pittsburgh's foundation date ? 1968. Young, but not  that  young.

       Got my first look at the future National Newman Library yesterday...  Wow.  It's only up to 3,000-something books as of yet, but I think it's off to a great start. Besides books directly by and about the Venerable, there are books on topics related to his life, such as the Oxford Movement, Patristics, Oratorianism, and such.   I, along with a bunch of other folks, was helping to do some cataloguing  of the current collection. The section I worked on was labeled "Catholicism in England-Recusancy and Restoration".  One of the books was called "The Catholic Families", and it was about the aristocratic recusant families which held onto the Faith through the centuries of persecution. I mention it because I spotted a chapter title which made me smile... "Red Hats and Coronets" !

        Venerable Newman on the Saints  Note particularly his comments on St. Philip Neri.....  "It is indeed most true that the holier a man is, and the higher in the kingdom of heaven, so much the greater need has he to look carefully to his footing, lest he stumble and be lost; and a deep conviction of this necessity has been the sole preservation of the Saints. Had they not feared, they never would have persevered. Hence, like St. Paul, they are always full of their sin and their peril. You would think them the most polluted of sinners, and the most unstable of penitents. Such was the blessed Martyr Ignatius, who, when on his way to his death, said, 'Now I begin to be Christ's disciple'. Such was the great Basil, who was ever ascribing the calamities of the Church and of his country to the wrath of Heaven upon his own sins. Such was St. Gregory, who submitted to his elevation to the Popedom, as if it were his spiritual death. Such too was my own dear Father St. Philip, who was ever showing, in the midst of the gifts he received from God, the anxiety and jealousy with which he regarded himself and his prospects. ' Every day,' says his biographer, 'he used to make a protest to God with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands, saying, "Lord, beware of me today, lest I should betray Thee, and do Thee all the mischief in the world" '. At other times he would say, 'The wound in Christ's side is large, but, if God did not guard me, I should make it larger'. In his last illness, 'Lord, if I recover, so far as I am concerned, I shall do more evil than ever, because I have promised so many times before to change my life, and have not kept my word, so that I despair of myself'. He would shed abundance of tears and say, 'I have never done one good action'. When he saw young persons, he began considering how much time they had before them to do good in, and said, 'O, happy you! O, happy you!' He often said, 'I am past hope,' and, when urged, he added, 'but I trust in God'. When a penitent of his called him a Saint, he turned to her with a face full of anger, and said, 'Begone with you, I am a devil, not a Saint'. When another said to him, "Father, a temptation has come to me to think you are not what the world takes you for," he answered, 'Be sure of this, that I am a man like my neighbours, and nothing more'.  What a reflection on ordinary Christians is the language of Saints about themselves!"   Discourses to Mixed Congregations

       For Saturday    Mary is the "Regina Martyrum," the Queen of Martyrs"   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    " Why is she so called?she who never had any blow, or wound, or other injury to her consecrated person. How can she be exalted over those whose bodies suffered the most ruthless violences and the keenest torments for our Lord's sake? She is, indeed, Queen of all Saints, of those who ' walk with Christ in white, for they are worthy; ' but how of those 'who were slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held? '  To answer this question, it must be recollected that the pains of the soul may be as fierce as those of the body. Bad men who are now in hell, and the elect of God who are in purgatory, are suffering only in their souls, for their bodies are still in the dust; yet how severe is that suffering! And perhaps most people who have lived long can bear witness in their own persons to a sharpness of distress which was like a sword cutting them, to a weight and force of sorrow which seemed to throw them down, though bodily pain there was none.  What an overwhelming horror it must have been for the Blessed Mary to witness the Passion and the Crucifixion of her Son! Her anguish was, as Holy Simeon had announced to her, at the time of that Son's Presentation in the Temple, a sword piercing her soul. If our Lord Himself could not bear the prospect of what was before Him, and was covered in the thought of it with a bloody sweat, His soul thus acting upon His body, does not this show how great mental pain can be? and would it have been wonderful though Mary's head and heart had given way as she stood under His Cross?  Thus is she most truly the Queen of  Martyrs . "   Meditations and Devotions

       The Effects of Sin  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "1. My Lord, Thou art the infinitely merciful God. Thou lovest all things that Thou hast created. Thou art the lover of souls. How then is it, O Lord, that I am in a world so miserable as this is? Can this be the world which Thou hast created, so full of pain and suffering? Who among the sons of Adam lives without suffering from his birth to his death? How many bad sicknesses and diseases are there! how many frightful accidents! how many great anxieties! how are men brought down and broken by grief, distress, the tumult of passions, and continual fear! What dreadful plagues are there ever on the earth: war, famine, and pestilence! Why is this, O my God? Why is this, O my soul? Dwell upon it, and ask thyself, Why is this? Has God changed His nature? yet how evil has the earth become!  2. O my God, I know full well why all these evils are. Thou hast not changed Thy nature, but man has ruined his own. We have sinned, O Lord, and therefore is this change. All these evils which I see and in which I partake are the fruit of sin. They would not have been, had we not sinned. They are but the first instalment of the punishment of sin. They are an imperfect and dim image of what sin is. Sin is infinitely worse than famine, than war, than pestilence. Take the most hideous of diseases, under which the body wastes away and corrupts, the blood is infected; the head, the heart, the lungs, every organ disordered, the nerves unstrung and shattered; pain in every limb, thirst, restlessness, deliriumall is nothing compared with that dreadful sickness of the soul which we call sin. They all are the effects of it, they all are shadows of it, but nothing more. That cause itself is something different in kind, is of a malignity far other and greater than all these things. O my God, teach me this! Give me to understand the enormity of that evil under which I labour and know it not. Teach me what sin is.  3. All these dreadful pains of body and soul are the fruits of sin, but they are nothing to its punishment in the world to come. The keenest and fiercest of bodily pains is nothing to the fire of hell; the most dire horror or anxiety is nothing to the never-dying worm of conscience; the greatest bereavement, loss of substance, desertion of friends, and forlorn desolation is nothing compared to the loss of God's countenance. Eternal punishment is the only true measure of the guilt of sin. My God, teach me this. Open my eyes and heart, I earnestly pray Thee, and make me understand how awful a body of death I bear about me. And, not only teach me about it, but in Thy mercy and by Thy grace remove it.

       Probably my favorite Lenten hymn...  We sang it at Vespers Sunday evening...  " The glory of these forty days We celebrate with songs of praise; For Christ, by Whom all things were made, Himself has fasted and has prayed.  Alone and fasting Moses saw The loving God Who gave the law; And to Elijah, fasting, came The steeds and chariots of flame.  So Daniel trained his mystic sight, Delivered from the lions might; And John, the Bridegrooms friend, became The herald of Messiahs Name.  Then grant us, Lord, like them to be Full oft in fast and prayer with Thee; Our spirits strengthen with Thy grace, And give us joy to see Thy face.  O Father, Son, and Spirit blest, To Thee be every prayer addressed, Who art in threefold Name adored, From age to age, the only Lord. "

       Part of a letter  written by Venerable John Henry Newman, in February of 1846, a few months after his reception into the Catholic Church... " Catholicism is a deep matteryou cannot take it up in a teacup.  Any dogmatic or sententious proposition would too surely be misunderstood. If I said, for instance, 'I have become a Catholic, because I must be either a Catholic or an infidel,' men would cry out 'So he has flung himself into the Catholic Church to escape infidelity,' whereas I should only mean that Catholicism and Christianity had in my mind become identical, so that to give up the one was to give up the other.  I do not know how to do justice to my reasons for becoming a Catholic in ever so many wordsbut if I attempted to do so in few, and that in print, I should wantonly expose myself and my cause to the hasty and prejudiced criticisms of opponents. This I will not do. People shall not say 'We have now got his reasons, and know their worth.' No, you have not got them, you cannot get them, except at the cost of some portion of the trouble I have been at myself. You cannot buy them for a crown pieceyou cannot take them in your hand at your will, and toss them about. You must consent to  think and you must exercise such resignation to the Divine Hand which leads you, as to follow it any whither. I am not assuming that my reasons are sufficient or unanswerable, when I say thisbut describing the way in which alone our intellect can be successfully exercised on the great subject in question, if the intellect is to be the instrument of conversion. Moral proofs are grown into, not learnt by heart. "

       From the homily  Fr. Joseph was the celebrant at noon Mass today. The point I remember best from the homily is that, as the prophet Isaiah says,  the Word of God does not return void. This is even more true for us as Catholic Christians. Not only do we hear the Word in the Scriptures, but we receive the Word Incarnate, Jesus Christ Himself, really present in the Holy Eucharist.

       From the homily  Fr. Drew was the celebrant at noon Mass today. The point I remember best in the homily was that there are two kinds of forgetting and two kinds of remembering. Forgetting ourselves and remembering God and others , like the 'sheep' in the Gospel, leads to eternal life. Forgetting God and others, and remembering ourselves, like the 'goats' in the Gospel, leads to the eternal death of Hell.

       Remember that litany I said I would work on ?  Last month, I  urlLink  posted  about a Jesuit-focused blogger and a Jesuit-focused litany she blogged. I mentioned that I was thinking of writing an Oratorian Litany. Well, I did it. This is, of course,  not  for public use, and I have not run it past anybody. I included only my two favorites from the Oratorian  venerabili  , since finding information on the others in English is tough. I used the magnificent  urlLink  Litany of St. Philip Neri  by the Venerable John Henry Newman as a template and swiped some of his titles for the founder.

       It's a day late...  but the Professor wrote this in a letter to his son, Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien, on March 8, 1941.  "I put before you the one great thing to love on earth:the Blessed Sacrament.... There you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon earth, and more than that: Death, by the divine paradox, that which ends life and demands the surrender of all, and yet, by the taste (or foretaste) of which alone can what you seek in your earthly relationships (love, faithfulness, joy) be maintained, or take on that complexion of reality, of eternal endurance, which every man's heart desires."

       From the homily  Fr. David celebrated noon Mass today. The point in the homily I remember best is that Our Lord, who in the passage immediately preceding today's Gospel, was called 'beloved Son' by the Father, proceeds, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, to go into the desolate wilderness and face the Enemy. This is because He is the beloved Son, and love and obedience are inimately connected.

       St. Philip in himself    (A Song.)   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   The holy Monks, conceal'd from men,  In midnight choir, or studious cell,  In sultry field, or wintry glen,  The holy Monks, I love them well.   The Friars too, the zealous band   By Dominic or Francis led,  They gather, and they take their stand   Where foes are fierce, or friends have fled.   And then the unwearied Company,  Which bears the Name of Sacred might,  The Knights of Jesus, they defy  The fiend,full eager for the fight.   Yet there is one I more affect  Than Jesuit, Hermit, Monk, or Friar,  'Tis an old man of sweet aspèct,   I love him more, I more admire.   I know him by his head of snow,  His ready smile, his keen full eye,  His words which kindle as they flow,  Save he be rapt in ecstasy.   He lifts his hands, there issues forth   A fragrance virginal and rare,  And now he ventures to our North,  Where hearts are frozen as the air.   He comes, by grace of his address,  By the sweet music of his face,  And his low tones of tenderness,  To melt a noble, stubborn race.   O sainted Philip, Father dear,  Look on thy little ones, that we  Thy loveliness may copy here,  And in the eternal Kingdom see.    The Oratory. 1850.

       The Evil of Sin  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  " 1. My God, I know that Thou didst create the whole universe very good; and if this was true of the material world which we see, much more true is it of the world of rational beings. The innumerable stars which fill the firmament, and the very elements out of which the earth is made, all are carried through their courses and their operations in perfect concord; but much higher was the concord which reigned in heaven when the Angels were first created. At that first moment of their existence the main orders of the Angels were in the most excellent harmony, and beautiful to contemplate; and the creation of man was expected next, to continue that harmony in the instance of a different kind of being. Then it was that suddenly was discovered a flaw or a rent in one point of this most delicate and exquisite weband it extended and unravelled the web, till a third part of it was spoilt; and then again a similar flaw was found in human kind, and it extended over the whole race. This dreadful evil, destroying so large a portion of all God's works, is sin.  2. My God, such is sin in Thy judgment; what is it in the judgment of the world? A very small evil or none at all. In the judgment of the Creator it is that which has marred His spiritual work; it is a greater evil than though the stars got loose, and ran wild in heaven, and chaos came again. But man, who is the guilty one, calls it by soft names. He explains it away. The world laughs at it, and is indulgent to it; and, as to its deserving eternal punishment, it rises up indignant at the idea, and rather than admit it, would deny the God who has said it does. The world thinks sin the same sort of imperfection as an impropriety, or want of taste or infirmity. O my soul, consider carefully the great difference between the views of sin taken by Almighty God and the world! Which of the two views do you mean to believe?  3. O my soul, which of the two wilt thou believethe word of God or the word of man? Is God right or is the creature right? Is sin the greatest of all possible evils or the least? My Lord and Saviour, I have no hesitation which to believe. Thou art true, and every man a liar. I will believe Thee, above the whole world. My God, imprint on my heart the infamous deformity of sin. Teach me to abhor it as a pestilenceas a fierce flame destroying on every side; as my death. Let me take up arms against it, and devote myself to fight under Thy banner in overcoming it.

        Well,  I  think it's funny...  Back in March of 1956, the Professor got a letter ...from a gentleman whose name was... Sam Gamgee !  It seems Mr. Gamgee had heard that his name was, ahem, mentioned in  The Lord of the Rings , though he had not read the book.  On March 18th, the Professor replied with a letter which ran, in part : "Dear Mr. Gamgee,  It was very kind of you to write. You can imagine my astonishment when I saw your signature ! I can only say, for your comfort, I hope, that the 'Sam Gamgee' of my story is a most heroic character, now widely beloved by many readers, even though his origins are rustic. So that perhaps you will not be displeased at the coincidence of the name of this imaginary character of supposedly many centuries ago being the same as yours."   The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien , ed. Humphrey Carpenter  He proceeded to send Mr. Gamgee signed copies of all three volumes of the book. However, this entire incident did start a bit of a worry, as recorded in his biography. "For some time I lived in fear of receiving a letter signed 'S. Gollum'. That would have been more difficult to deal with. "   Tolkien: A Biography  by Humphrey Carpenter

       The  Ancient Irish and the Ancient English  From  urlLink  The Rise and Progress of Universities   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "The seventh and eighth centuries are the glory of the Anglo-Saxon Church, as are the sixth and seventh of the Irish. As the Irish missionaries travelled down through England, France, and Switzerland, to lower Italy, and attempted Germany at the peril of their lives, converting the barbarian, restoring the lapsed, encouraging the desolate, collecting the scattered, and founding churches, schools, and monasteries, as they went along; so, amid the deep pagan woods of Germany and round about, the English Benedictine plied his axe and drove his plough, planted his rude dwelling and raised his rustic altar upon the ruins of idolatry, and then settling down as a colonist upon the soil, began to sing his chants and to copy his old volumes, and thus to lay the slow but sure foundations of the new civilization. Distinct, nay antagonistic, in character and talent, the one nation and the other, Irish and English, the one more resembling the Greek, the other the Roman, open from the first perhaps to jealousies as well as rivalries, they consecrated their respective gifts to the Almighty Giver, and, labouring together for the same great end, they obliterated whatever there was of human infirmity in their mutual intercourse by the merit of their common achievements. Each by turn could claim pre-eminence in the contest of sanctity and of learning. In the schools of science England has no name to rival Erigena in originality, or St. Virgil in freedom of thought; nor among its canonized women any saintly virgin to compare with St. Bridget; nor, although it has 150 saints in its calendar, can it pretend to equal that Irish multitude which the Book of Life alone is large enough to contain. Nor can Ireland, on the other hand, boast of a doctor such as St. Bede, or of an Apostle equal to St. Boniface, or of a Martyr like St. Thomas,or of so long a catalogue of royal devotees as that of the thirty male or female Saxons who in the course of two centuries resigned their crowns, or as the roll of twenty-three kings, and sixty queens and princes, who, between the seventh and the eleventh centuries, gained a place among the saints. Yet, after all, the Irish, whose brilliancy of genius has sometimes been considered, like the Greek, to augur fickleness and change, have managed to persevere to this day in the science of the saints, long after their ancient rivals have lost the gift of faith.

       Short Meditations on the Stations of the Cross- Part One   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Begin with an Act of Contrition  First Station Jesus condemned to Death  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   The Holy, Just, and True was judged by sinners, and put to death. Yet, while they judged, they were compelled to acquit Him. Judas, who betrayed Him, said, "I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood." Pilate, who sentenced Him, said, "I am innocent of the blood of this just person," and threw the guilt upon the Jews. The Centurion who saw Him crucified said, "Indeed this was a just man." Thus ever, O Lord, Thou art justified in Thy words, and dost overcome when Thou art judged. And so, much more, at the last day "They shall look on Him whom they pierced"; and He who was condemned in weakness shall judge the world in power, and even those who are condemned will confess their judgment is just.   Pater, Ave, &c.  V. Miserere nostri, Domine. R. Miserere nostri. Fidelium animæ, &c.    The Second Station Jesus receives His Cross  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   Jesus supports the whole world by His divine power, for He is God; but the weight was less heavy than was the Cross which our sins hewed out for Him. Our sins cost Him this humiliation. He had to take on Him our nature, and to appear among us as a man, and to offer up for us a great sacrifice. He had to pass a life in penance, and to endure His passion and death at the end of it. O Lord God Almighty, who dost bear the weight of the whole world without weariness, who bore the weight of all our sins, though they wearied Thee, as Thou art the Preserver of our bodies by Thy Providence, so be Thou the Saviour of our souls by Thy precious blood.   Pater, Ave, &c.   The Third Station Jesus falls under the weight of the Cross the first time  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   Satan fell from heaven in the beginning; by the just sentence of his Creator he fell, against whom he had rebelled. And when he had succeeded in gaining man to join him in his rebellion, and his Maker came to save him, then his brief hour of triumph came, and he made the most of it. When the Holiest had taken flesh, and was in his power, then in his revenge and malice he determined, as he himself had been struck down by the Almighty arm, to strike in turn a heavy blow at Him who struck him. Therefore it was that Jesus fell down so suddenly. O dear Lord, by this Thy first fall raise us all out of sin, who have so miserably fallen under its power.   Pater, Ave, &c.   The Fourth Station Jesus meets His Mother  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   There is no part of the history of Jesus but Mary has her part in it. There are those who profess to be His servants, who think that her work was ended when she bore Him, and after that she had nothing to do but disappear and be forgotten. But we, O Lord, Thy children of the Catholic Church, do not so think of Thy Mother. She brought the tender infant into the Temple, she lifted Him up in her arms when the wise men came to adore Him. She fled with Him to Egypt, she took Him up to Jerusalem when He was twelve years old. He lived with her at Nazareth for thirty years. She was with Him at the marriage-feast. Even when He had left her to preach, she hovered about Him. And now she shows herself as He toils along the Sacred Way with His cross on His shoulders. Sweet Mother, let us ever think of thee when we think of Jesus, and when we pray to Him, ever aid us by thy powerful intercession.   Pater, Ave, &c.   The Fifth Station Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus to carry the Cross  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   Jesus could bear His Cross alone, did He so will; but He permits Simon to help Him, in order to remind us that we must take part in His sufferings, and have a fellowship in His work. His merit is infinite, yet He condescends to let His people add their merit to it. The sanctity of the Blessed Virgin, the blood of the Martyrs, the prayers and penances of the Saints, the good deeds of all the faithful, take part in that work which, nevertheless, is perfect without them. He saves us by His blood, but it is through and with ourselves that He saves us. Dear Lord, teach us to suffer with Thee, make it pleasant to us to suffer for Thy sake, and sanctify all our sufferings by the merits of Thy own.   Pater, Ave, &c.   The Sixth Station The Face of Jesus is wiped by Veronica  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   Jesus let the pious woman carry off an impression of His Sacred Countenance, which was to last to future ages. He did this to remind us all, that His image must ever be impressed on all our hearts. Whoever we are, in whatever part of the earth, in whatever age of the world, Jesus must live in our hearts. We may differ from each other in many things, but in this we must all agree, if we are His true children. We must bear about with us the napkin of St. Veronica; we must ever meditate upon His death and resurrection, we must ever imitate His divine excellence, according to our measure. Lord, let our countenances be ever pleasing in Thy sight, not defiled with sin, but bathed and washed white in Thy precious blood.   Pater, Ave, &c.   The Seventh Station Jesus falls a second time  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   Satan had a second fall, when our Lord came upon earth. By that time he had usurped the dominion of the whole worldand he called himself its king. And he dared to take up the Holy Saviour in his arms, and show Him all kingdoms, and blasphemously promise to give them to Him, His Maker, if He would adore him. Jesus answered, "Begone, Satan!"and Satan fell down from the high mountain. And Jesus bare witness to it when He said, "I saw Satan, as lightning, falling from heaven." The Evil One remembered this second defeat, and so now he smote down the Innocent Lord a second time, now that he had Him in his power. O dear Lord, teach us to suffer with Thee, and not be afraid of Satan's buffetings, when they come on us from resisting him.   Pater, Ave, &c.      Meditations and Devotions

       For Thursday   "The world cannot believe that Catholics really hold what they profess to hold; and supposes that, if they are educated men, they are kept up to their profession by external influence, by superstitious fear, by pride, by interest, or other bad or unworthy motive. Men of the world have never believed in their whole life, never have had simple faith in things unseen, never have had more than an opinion about them, that they might be true and might be false, but probably were true, or doubtless were true; and in consequence they think an absolute, unhesitating faith in anything unseen to be simply an extravagance, and especially when it is exercised on objects which they do not believe themselves, or even reject with scorn or abhorrence. And hence they prophesy that the Catholic Church must lose, in proportion as men are directed to the sober examination of their own thoughts and feelings, and to the separation of what is real and true from what is a matter of words and pretence. They cannot understand how our faith in the Blessed Sacrament is a genuine, living portion of our minds; they think it a mere profession which we embrace with no inward assent, but only because we are told that we should be lost unless we profess it; or because, the Catholic Church having in dark ages committed herself to it, we cannot help ourselves, though we would if we could, and therefore receive it by constraint, from a sense of duty towards our cause, or in a spirit of party. They will not believe that we would not gladly get rid of the doctrine of transubstantiation, as a heavy stone about our necks, if we could. What shocking words to use! It would be wrong to use them, were they not necessary to make you understand, my brethren, the privilege which you have, and the world has not. Shocking indeed and most profane! a relief to rid ourselves of the doctrine that Jesus is on our Altars! as well say a relief to rid ourselves of the belief that Jesus is God, to rid ourselves of the belief that there is a God."

       From the homily  Fr. Michael was celebrating noon Mass today. What I remember best from the homily is the idea that sometimes we try to 'cast out Satan with Satan.' We give in to certain sins to avoid others. Perhaps this is most obvious in the realm of sexual temptation. For example, a married man is tempted to infidelity, so instead he checks out pornographic websites, or a college student is tempted to fornication, but instead commits solitary acts of impurity. In avoiding the greater sin, we let ourselves indulge in the lesser. However, this binds us to the Enemy, and divides the 'kingdom' of our soul. And a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.

       The Solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord  is today. There is information on it  urlLink  here.  Others have blogged on it, including  urlLink  Gerard  ,  urlLink  Domenico Bettinelli  , and   urlLink  Lover of Christian Art  .   "Our sweet Christ, the Word Incarnate, has given Himself to us for every thing that was necessary for us, even to the hard and ignominious death upon the Cross. " - St. Philip Neri  " Mary is the  Janua Cli , the Gate of Heaven    Mary  is called the Gate of Heaven, because it was through her that our Lord passed from heaven to earth. The Prophet Ezechiel, prophesying of Mary, says, 'the gate shall be closed, it shall not be opened, and no man shall pass through it, since the Lord God of Israel has entered through itand it shall be closed for the Prince, the Prince Himself shall sit in it.'  Now this is fulfilled, not only in our Lord having taken flesh from her, and being her Son, but, moreover, in that she had a place in the economy of Redemption; it is fulfilled in her spirit and will, as well as in her body. Eve had a part in the fall of man, though it was Adam who was our representative, and whose sin made us sinners. It was Eve who began, and who tempted Adam. Scripture says: 'The woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold; and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband, and he did eat.' It was fitting then in God's mercy that, as the woman began the  destruction  of the world, so woman should also begin its  recovery , and that, as Eve opened the way for the fatal deed of the first Adam, so Mary should open the way for the great achievement of the second Adam, even our Lord Jesus Christ, who came to save the world by dying on the cross for it. Hence Mary is called by the holy Fathers a second and a better Eve, as having taken that first step in the salvation of mankind which Eve took in its ruin.  How, and when, did Mary take part, and the initial part, in the world's restoration? It was when the Angel Gabriel came to her to announce to her the great dignity which was to be her portion. St. Paul bids us 'present our bodies to God as a reasonable service.' We must not only pray with our lips, and fast, and do outward penance, and be chaste in our bodies; but we must be obedient, and pure in our minds. And so, as regards the Blessed Virgin, it was God's will that she should undertake  willingly  and with  full   understanding  to be the Mother of our Lord, and not to be a mere passive instrument whose maternity would have no merit and no reward. The higher our gifts, the heavier our duties. It was no light lot to be so intimately near to the Redeemer of men, as she experienced afterwards when she suffered with him. Therefore, weighing well the Angel's words before giving her answer to themfirst she asked whether so great an office would be a forfeiture of that Virginity which she had vowed. When the Angel told her no, then, with the full consent of a full heart, full of God's love to her and her own lowliness, she said, 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done unto me according to thy word.' It was by this consent that she became the  Gate of Heaven.  "  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Meditations and Devotions    Tolkien Note (WARNING: SPOILER !)    As Mr. Shea noted  urlLink  here  , it is also, in the Tolkien-verse, the day the One Ring was destroyed.   "In Gondor the New Year will always now begin upon the twenty-fifth of March when Sauron fell, and when you were brought out of the fire to the King." Gandalf to Samwise Gamgee, "The Field of Cormallen",  The Lord of the Rings   (Side note to anybody as Tolkien-geeky as me or more: Yes, I know about the difference between Shire Reckoning and the Gregorian calendar and that the real date would be sometime in April. I'm merely choosing to ignore it.)

        Prayer request for a  friend...  I'm wondering if there are a lot of guys out there with his problem. Steve, after a lot of prayer and counsel, has discerned that God is calling him to the priesthood. Problem is, his parents are not practicing Catholics. His mother sometimes shows up at Mass on Sunday, but not on a regular basis. His father, on the other hand, is a very bitter fallen-away Catholic who reacts to the Church's teachings with venom.  So besides trying to discern whether he should be a diocesan priest, a religious, or maybe even an Oratorian, he's got to deal with this family issue. Please pray that when he does tell them, they may be more supportive than he fears. If they are not, and his fears are realized, pray that he may deal well with whatever they throw at him.   St. Monica is the patroness for parents with children who have left the Faith. Is there a patron for children whose parents have left the Faith ?

(This is their first baby, and they seem to be utterly besotted. Alan admitted that he's up to over 3,000 pictures ! ) Then there were Jerry and Miranda, and their first little one, Finnian, who is eleven days old.  Young Catholic families.

       Today's first reading  is just too good not to blog. "The wicked said among themselves, thinking not aright: 'Let us beset the just one, because he is obnoxious to us; he sets himself against our doings, reproaches us for transgressions of the law and charges us with violations of our training. He professes to have knowledge of God and styles himself a child of the Lord. To us he is the censure of our thoughts;  merely to see him is a hardship for us, Because his life is not like that of others, and different are his ways. He judges us debased; he holds aloof from our paths as from things impure. He calls blest the destiny of the just and boasts that God is his Father. Let us see whether his words be true; let us find out what will happen to him. For if the just one be the son of God, he will defend him and deliver him from the hand of his foes. With revilement and torture let us put him to the test that we may have proof of his gentleness and try his patience. Let us condemn him to a shameful death; for according to his own words, God will take care of him.' These were their thoughts, but they erred; for their wickedness blinded them, and they knew not the hidden counsels of God; neither did they count on a recompense of holiness nor discern the innocent souls' reward. "   Wisdom 2:1a, 12-22

        Short Meditations on the Stations of the Cross- Part Two  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    The Eighth Station The Women of Jerusalem mourn for Our Lord  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   Ever since the prophecy of old time, that the Saviour of man was to be born of a woman of the stock of Abraham, the Jewish women had desired to bear Him. Yet, now that He was really come, how different, as the Gospel tells us, was the event from what they had expected. He said to them "that the days were coming when they should say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the breasts which have not given suck." Ah, Lord, we know not what is good for us, and what is bad. We cannot foretell the future, nor do we know, when Thou comest to visit us, in what form Thou wilt come. And therefore we leave it all to Thee. Do Thou Thy good pleasure to us and in us. Let us ever look at Thee, and do Thou look upon us, and give us the grace of Thy bitter Cross and Passion, and console us in Thy own way and at Thy own time.   Pater, Ave, &c.    The Ninth Station Jesus falls the third time  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   Satan will have a third and final fall at the end of the world, when he will be shut up for good in the everlasting fiery prison. He knew this was to be his endhe has no hope, but despair only. He knew that no suffering which he could at that moment inflict upon the Saviour of men would avail to rescue himself from that inevitable doom. But, in horrible rage and hatred, he determined to insult and torture while he could the great King whose throne is everlasting. Therefore a third time he smote Him down fiercely to the earth. O Jesus, Only-begotten Son of God, the Word Incarnate, we adore with fear and trembling and deep thankfulness Thy awful humiliation, that Thou who art the Highest, should have permitted Thyself, even for one hour, to be the sport and prey of the Evil One.   Pater, Ave, &c.    The Tenth Station Jesus is stripped of His Garments  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   Jesus would give up everything of this world, before He left it. He exercised the most perfect poverty. When He left the Holy House of Nazareth, and went out to preach, He had not where to lay His head. He lived on the poorest food, and on what was given to Him by those who loved and served Him. And therefore He chose a death in which not even His clothes were left to Him. He parted with what seemed most necessary, and even a part of Him, by the law of human nature since the fall. Grant us in like manner, O dear Lord, to care nothing for anything on earth, and to bear the loss of all things, and to endure even shame, reproach, contempt, and mockery, rather than that Thou shalt be ashamed of us at the last day.   Pater, Ave, &c.   The Eleventh Station Jesus is nailed to the Cross  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   Jesus is pierced through each hand and each foot with a sharp nail. His eyes are dimmed with blood, and are closed by the swollen lids and livid brows which the blows of His executioners have caused. His mouth is filled with vinegar and gall. His head is encircled by the sharp thorns. His heart is pierced with the spear. Thus, all His senses are mortified and crucified, that He may make atonement for every kind of human sin. O Jesus, mortify and crucify us with Thee. Let us never sin by hand or foot, by eyes or mouth, or by head or heart. Let all our senses be a sacrifice to Thee; let every member sing Thy praise. Let the sacred blood which flowed from Thy five wounds anoint us with such sanctifying grace that we may die to the world, and live only to Thee.   Pater, Ave, &c.    The Twelfth Station Jesus dies upon the Cross  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   "Consummatum est." It is completedit has come to a full end. The mystery of God's love towards us is accomplished. The price is paid, and we are redeemed. The Eternal Father determined not to pardon us without a price, in order to show us especial favour. He condescended to make us valuable to Him. What we buy we put a value on. He might have saved us without a priceby the mere fiat of His will. But to show His love for us He took a price, which, if there was to be a price set upon us at all, if there was any ransom at all to be taken for the guilt of our sins, could be nothing short of the death of His Son in our nature. O my God and Father, Thou hast valued us so much as to pay the highest of all possible prices for our sinful soulsand shall we not love and choose Thee above all things as the one necessary and one only good?   Pater, Ave, &c.      The Thirteenth Station Jesus is laid in the arms of His Blessed Mother  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   He is thy property now, O Virgin Mother, once again, for He and the world have met and parted. He went out from Thee to do His Father's workand He has done and suffered it. Satan and bad men have now no longer any claim upon Himtoo long has He been in their arms. Satan took Him up aloft to the high mountain; evil men lifted Him up upon the Cross. He has not been in Thy arms, O Mother of God, since He was a childbut now thou hast a claim upon Him, when the world has done its worst. For thou art the all-favoured, all-blessed, all-gracious Mother of the Highest. We rejoice in this great mystery. He has been hidden in thy womb, He has lain in thy bosom, He has been suckled at thy breasts, He has been carried in thy armsand now that He is dead, He is placed upon thy lap. Virgin Mother of God, pray for us.   Pater, Ave, &c.   The Fourteenth Station Jesus is laid in the Sepulchre  V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.   Jesus, when He was nearest to His everlasting triumph, seemed to be farthest from triumphing. When He was nearest upon entering upon His kingdom, and exercising all power in heaven and earth, He was lying dead in a cave of the rock. He was wrapped round in burying-clothes, and confined within a sepulchre of stone, where He was soon to have a glorified spiritual body, which could penetrate all substances, go to and fro quicker than thought, and was about to ascend on high. Make us to trust in thee, O Jesus, that Thou wilt display in us a similar providence. Make us sure, O Lord, that the greater is our distress, the nearer we are to Thee. The more men scorn us, the more Thou dost honour us. The more men insult over us, the higher Thou wilt exalt us. The more they forget us, the more Thou dost keep us in mind. The more they abandon us, the closer Thou wilt bring us to Thyself.   Pater, Ave, &c.    LET US PRAY  God, who by the Precious Blood of Thy only-begotten Son didst sanctify the standard of the Cross, grant, we beseech Thee, that we who rejoice in the glory of the same Holy Cross may at all times and places rejoice in Thy protection, through the same Christ, our Lord.   End with one Pater, Ave, and Gloria, for the intention of the Sovereign Pontiff.     Meditations and Devotions

       I will not blow my stack..I will not blow my stack....I will not blow my stack...  In my just mentioned Google search, I came across an egregious idiot listing my beloved Venerable Newman on a list of 'gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered saints'.  ( To be fair, he did state that the Venerable 'almost certainly abstained from expressing his sexuality genitally.'  )  His evidence for this ? That Venerable Newman wept bitterly over the death of his closest friend Fr. Ambrose St. John and requested that after his own death, he would be buried in the same grave .  Apparently, this man has no understanding of a. spiritual friendship b. pre-Victorian and Victorian-era sentimentality ......   At least the Venerable was in good company... in my quick glance I saw St. Paul and St. Jeanne Darc tarred with the same brush, and on evidence as slender-to-nonexistent.....

       For Tuesday  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. .....  1. Place yourself in the presence of God, kneeling with your hands clasped.  2. Read slowly and devoutly   Psalm xc. (as it is found in Compline)   3. Bring all you have read before you, as if you saw the Angels protecting you, especially your Guardian Angel.  4. Then say to God whatever is suggested to you; for instance:  "He hath given His Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. In their hands they shall bear thee up, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone."  (1) O my God, I will go forward in Thy way, for my Guardian goes with me. I am very blind; I know not what is before me. I know not what will happen to me in life. I do not know whether I shall live long, or die young. But this I know, that in health and sickness, in joy and sorrow, in youth and age, Thou wilt be with me.  (2) O my sweet Guardian, how beautiful thou art. I wish I could see thee. And thou art as pure and holy as thou art beautiful, and thy breath inspires chaste thoughts. And as gentle and kind as thou art pure.  5. Conclusion.God of Angels, have mercy on me. Queen of Angels, pray for me.    Meditations and Devotions

       For Saturday   Mary is the "Turris Eburnea," the Ivory Tower  by Venerable John Henry Newman   "A tower is a fabric which rises higher and more conspicuous than other objects in its neighbourhood. Thus, when we say a man "towers" over his fellows, we mean to signify that they look small in comparison of him.  This quality of greatness is instanced in the Blessed Virgin. Though she suffered more keen and intimate anguish at our Lord's Passion and Crucifixion than any of the Apostles by reason of her being His Mother, yet consider how much more noble she was amid her deep distress than they were. When our Lord underwent His agony, they slept for sorrow. They could not wrestle with their deep disappointment and despondency; they could not master it; it confused, numbed, and overcame their senses. And soon after, when St. Peter was asked by bystanders whether he was not one of our Lord's disciples, he denied it.  Nor was he alone in this cowardice. The Apostles, one and all, forsook our Lord and fled, though St. John returned. Nay, still further, they even lost faith in Him, and thought all the great expectations which He had raised in them had ended in a failure. How different this even from the brave conduct of St. Mary Magdalen! and still more from that of the Virgin Mother! It is expressly noted of her that she  stood  by the Cross. She did not grovel in the dust, but  stood upright   to receive the blows, the stabs, which the long Passion of her Son inflicted upon her every moment.  In this magnanimity and generosity in suffering she is, as compared with the Apostles, fitly imaged as a  Tower . But towers, it may be said, are huge, rough, heavy, obtrusive, graceless structures, for the purposes of war, not of peace; with nothing of the beautifulness, refinement, and finish which are conspicuous in Mary. It is true: therefore she is called the Tower of  Ivory , to suggest to us, by the brightness, purity, and exquisiteness of that material, how transcendent is the loveliness and the gentleness of the Mother of God."

       April 12, 1822   was an important day in the life of the Venerable.   " 'I have this morning been elected Fellow of Oriel.' "  "Mr. Newman used also to relate the mode in which the announcement of his success was made to him. The Provost's butlerto whom it fell by usage to take the news to the fortunate candidatemade his way to Mr. Newman's lodgings in Broad Street, and found him playing the violin. This in itself disconcerted the messenger, who did not associate such an accomplishment with a candidateship for the Oriel Common-Room; but his perplexity was increased when, on his delivering what may be supposed to have been his usual form of speech on such occasions, that 'he had, he feared, disagreeable news to announce, viz. that Mr. Newman was elected Fellow of Oriel, and that his immediate presence was required there,' the person addressed, thinking that such language savoured of impertinent familiarity, merely answered, 'Very well,' and went on fiddling. This led the man to ask whether, perhaps, he had not mistaken the rooms and gone to the wrong person, to which Mr. Newman replied that it was all right. But, as may be imagined, no sooner had the man left, than he flung down his instrument, and dashed down stairs with all speed to Oriel College. And he recollected, after fifty years, the eloquent faces and eager bows of the tradesmen and others whom he met on his way, who had heard the news, and well understood why he was crossing from St. Mary's to the lane opposite at so extraordinary a pace."  " There remains a letter, from a school-fellow and University friend, which shows the popular estimate of an Oriel fellowship as well as the writer's sense of his friend's power:  F. R. THRESHER TO JOHN HENRY NEWMAN   April 12, 1822. Behold you now a Fellow of Oriel, the great object of the ambition of half the Bachelors of Oxford. Behold you (to take a peep into futurity) in Holy Orders, taking pupils in college, and having a curacy within a short distance; then Public Tutor, Vicar of , Provost, Regius Professor of Divinity, Bishop of , Archbishop of Canterbury; or shall we say thusStudent-at-law, Barrister, Lord Chancellor, or at least Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench? Which of these ladders is it your intention to climb? You now have it in your power to decide."  "As to Mr. Newman, he ever felt this twelfth of April, 1822, to be the turning-point of his life, and of all days most memorable. It raised him from obscurity and need, to competency and reputation."    Autobiographical Memoir   This was especially remarkable in that, brilliant as the Venerable was, he was very much an underdog candidate, in that he was barely twenty-one and had been an undergraduate at Trinity College, which, at that time, had a rather poor academic reputation. In addition, he had not distinguished himself in his final examinations, earning, not the double First he had hoped for, but a Second and what would now be called a Third, but was then simply referred to as being 'under the line.' (The reason Newman had done so poorly was because before his finals, he completely swamped himself with work, studying nine to 16 hours a day. When the examination actually came, he was so exhausted he pretty much collapsed.)   His 'ladder' was, of course, to be neither one of the ones his friend Thresher mapped out...

       From "The Infinitude of the Divine Attributes"  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "  Semetipsum exinanivit , 'He made Himself void or empty,' as the earth had been 'void and empty' at the beginning; He seemed to be unbinding and letting loose the assemblage of attributes which made Him God, and to be destroying the idea which He Himself had implanted in our minds. The God of miracles did the most awful of signs and wonders, by revoking and contradicting, as it were, all His perfections, though He remained the while one and the same. Omnipotence became an abject; the Life became a leper; the first and only Fair came down to us with an 'inglorious visage,' and an 'unsightly form,' bleeding and (I may say) ghastly, lifted up in nakedness and stretched out in dislocation before the eyes of sinners. Not content with this, He perpetuates the history of His humiliation; men of this world, when they fall into trouble, and then recover themselves, hide the memorials of it. They conceal their misfortunes in prospect, as long as they can; bear them perforce, when they fall into them; and, when they have overcome them, affect to make light of them. Kings of the earth, when they have rid themselves of their temporary conquerors, and are reinstated on their thrones, put all things back into their former state, and remove from their palaces, council-rooms, and cities, whether statue or picture or inscription or edict, all of which bear witness to the suspension of their power. Soldiers indeed boast of their scars, but it is because their foes were well-matched with them, and their conflicts were necessary, and the marks of what they have suffered is a proof of what they have done; but He, who  oblatus est, quia voluit , who "was offered, for He willed it," who exposed Himself to the powers of evil, yet could have saved us without that exposure, who was neither weak in that He was overcome, nor strong in that He overcame, proclaims to the whole world what He has gone through, without the tyrant's shame, without the soldier's prideHe (wonderful it is) has raised up on high, He has planted over the earth, the memorial, that that Evil One whom He cast out of heaven in the beginning, has in the hour of darkness inflicted agony upon Him. For in truth, by consequence of the infinitude of His glory, He is more beautiful in His weakness than in His strength; His wounds shine like stars of light; His very Cross becomes an object of worship; the instruments of His passion, the nails and the thorny crown, are replete with miraculous power. And so He bids the commemoration of His Bloody Sacrifice to be made day by day all over the earth, and He Himself is there in Person to quicken and sanctify it; He rears His bitter but saving Cross in every Church and over every Altar; He shows Himself torn and bleeding upon the wood at the corners of each street and in every village market-place; He makes it the symbol of His religion; He seals our foreheads, our lips, and our breast with this triumphant sign; with it He begins and ends our days, and with it He consigns us to the tomb. And when He comes again, that Sign of the Son of Man will be seen in heaven; and when He takes His seat in judgment, the same glorious marks will be seen by all the world in His Hands, Feet, and Side, which were dug into them at the season of His degradation. Thus 'hath King Solomon made himself a litter of the wood of Libanus. The pillars thereof he made of silver, the seat of gold, the going up of purple; the midst he covered with charity for the daughters of Jerusalem. Go forth, ye daughters of Sion; and see King Solomon in the diadem, wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of his heart's joy.' "   Discourses to Mixed Congregations , 1849

I found this posted on HMS Blog by Mr. Gotcher.    urlLink  A nice witness to  the grace of God    This is great for somebody like me, a  cradle Catholic with an addiction to conversion stories. I'll be asking Venerable Newman for his intercession for this man, since the Venerable certainly knew what having family members who are very unsympathetic to one's reception into the Church was like.

       The Feast of St. Stanislaus of Cracow, Bishop and Martyr  is today. There is information on him  urlLink  here  .   The way I figure it, the intercession of a bishop with backbone is  precisely  what is needed these days.   It is also the Feast of St. Gemma Galgani. There is information on her  urlLink  here  . I knew a girl once who looked a  lot  like St. Gemma. She came as St. Gemma to an All Saints Day party, and everybody would look at the picture of the saint she had brought, look at her, and do a 'double take ' ! The resemblance was that remarkable.

       VespersMonday     Immense cli conditor.    Translated by John Henry Newman, C.O.    Lord of unbounded space,   Who, lest the sky and main   Should mix, and heaven should lose its place,   Didst the rude waters chain;    Parting the moist and rare,   That rills on earth might flow   To soothe the angry flame, whene'er    It ravens from below;     Pour on us of Thy grace    The everlasting spring;     Lest our frail steps renew the trace     Of the ancient wandering.       May faith in lustre grow,      And rear her star in heaven,      Paling all sparks of earth below,      Unquench'd by damps of even.       Grant it, O Father, Son,      And Holy Spirit of grace,       To whom be glory, Three in One,          In every time and place.

       Personal anniversary...  On April 6th, 1999, I was admitted as a member of the Secular Oratory. In honor of the anniversary of my entrance in the Family of St. Philip, I post the following verse by one of the greatest of his sons.    St. Philip Neri in his Mission    (A song.)  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   In the far North our lot is cast,   Where faithful hearts are few;  Still are we Philip's children dear,   And Peter's soldiers true.   Founder and Sire! to mighty Rome,   Beneath St. Peter's shade,  Early thy vow of loyal love   And ministry was paid.   The solemn porch, and portal high,   Of Peter was thy home;  The world's Apostle he, and thou   Apostle of his Rome.   And first in the old catacombs,  In galleries long and deep,  Where martyr Popes had ruled the flock,  And slept their glorious sleep,   There didst thou pass the nights in prayer,   Until at length there came,  Down on thy breast, new lit for thee,   The Pentecostal flame;   Then, in that heart-consuming love,   Didst walk the city wide,  And lure the noble and the young  From Babel's pomp and pride;   And, gathering them within thy cell,  Unveil the lustre bright,  And beauty of thy inner soul,   And gain them by the sight.   And thus to Rome, for Peter's faith  Far known, thou didst impart  Thy lessons of the hidden life,   And discipline of heart.   And as the Apostle, on the hill  Facing the Imperial Town,  First gazed upon his fair domain,  Then on the cross lay down,   So thou, from out the streets of Rome  Didst turn thy failing eye  Unto that mount of martyrdom, Take leave of it, and die.   [Note]  On the day of his death, Philip, "at the beginning of his Mass, remained for some time looking fixedly at the hill of St. Onofrio, which was visible from the chapel, just as if he saw some great vision. On coming to the  Gloria in Excelsis , he began to sing, which was a very unusual thing for him, and he sang the whole of it with the greatest joy and devotion," &c.Bacci's  Life of St. Philip  Neri      The Oratory. 1850.

       From the homily  Fr. Drew celebrated the noon Mass at Heinz Chapel today. His homily included one of my favorite St. Philip stories, which I duly record here.  One of St. Philip's followers, Agostino Manni, had recently been ordained to the priesthood. Early in his ministry, he was preparing a sermon. Actually, he didn't just prepare it. He polished that sermon until it glistened, and when he preached it, his listeners were spellbound. Afterwards, various people came up and congratulated him on preaching so well. Fr. Manni, listening to all this praise, began to feel, well, pleased with himself.  Philip had been listening as well, and Fr. Manni asked him what he had thought.  Fr. Philip said he thought it was brilliant. In fact, he said people ought to hear it again, and promptly ordered  he should preach the same sermon again. Word for word. For the  next six times  he preached ! By the time that was over, Fr. Agostino's temptation to vainglory was dead and buried, mostly from hearing people say as he came in, "Oh, no ! Not that poor priest who only has one sermon again !   "

        The Infinitude of the Divine Attributes     by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "We all know well, and firmly hold, that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the Cross in satisfaction for our sins. This truth is the great foundation of all our hopes, and the object of our most earnest faith and most loving worship. And yet, however well we know it, it is a subject which admits of drawing out, and insisting on in detail, in a way which most persons will feel profitable to themselves. I shall now attempt to do this in some measure, and to follow the reflections to which it leads; though at this season many words would be out of place.  Christ died for our sins, for the sins of the whole world; but He need not have died, for the Almighty God might have saved us all, might have saved the whole world, without His dying. He might have pardoned and brought to heaven every individual child of Adam without the incarnation and death of His Son. He might have saved us without any ransom and without any delay. He might have abolished original sin, and restored Adam at once. His word had been enough; with Him to say is to do. 'All things are possible to Thee,'was the very reason our Lord gave in His agony for asking that the chalice might pass from Him. As in the beginning He said, 'Let light be, and light was'; so might He have spoken again, and sin would have vanished from the soul, and guilt with it. Or He might have employed a mediator less powerful than His own Son; He might have accepted the imperfect satisfaction of some mere man. He wants not for resources; but He willed otherwise. He who ever does the best, saw in His infinite wisdom that it was expedient and fitting to take a ransom. As He has not hindered the reprobate from resisting His grace and rejecting redemption, so He has not pardoned any who are to enter His eternal kingdom, without a true and sufficient satisfaction for their sin. Both in the one case and the other, He has done, not what was possible merely, but what was best. And this is why the coming of the Word was necessary; for if a true satisfaction was to be made, then nothing could accomplish this, short of the incarnation of the All-holy.  You see, then, my brethren, how voluntary was the mission and death of our Lord; if an instance can be imagined of voluntary suffering, it is this. He came to die when He need not have died; He died to satisfy for what might have been pardoned without satisfaction; He paid a price which need not have been asked, nay, which needed to be accepted when paid. It may be said with truth, that, rigorously speaking, one being can never, by his own suffering, simply discharge the debt of another's sin . Accordingly, He died, not in order to exert a peremptory claim on the Divine justice, if I may so speak,as if He were bargaining in the market-place, or pursuing a plea in a court of law,but in a more loving, generous, munificent way, did He shed that blood, which was worth ten thousand lives of men, worth more than the blood of all the sons of Adam poured out together, in accordance with His Father's will, who, for wise reasons unrevealed, exacted it as the condition of their pardon.

       From the novel,  Loss and Gain    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " A priest, or at least an assistant, had mounted for a moment above the altar, and removed a chalice or vessel which stood there; he could not see distinctly. A cloud of incense was rising on high; the people suddenly all bowed low; what could it mean? the truth flashed on him, fearfully yet sweetly; it was the Blessed Sacramentit was the Lord Incarnate who was on the altar, who had come to visit and to bless His people. It was the Great Presence, which makes a Catholic Church different from every other place in the world; which makes it, as no other place can be, holy. The Breviary offices were by this time not unknown to Reding; and as he threw himself on the pavement, in sudden self-abasement and joy, some words of those great Antiphons came into his mouth, from which Willis had formerly quoted: ' O Adonai, et Dux domûs Israel, qui Moysi in rubo apparuisti; O Emmanuel, Exspectatio Gentium et Salvator earum, veni ad salvandum nos, Domine Deus noster '.

       St. Philip and the Blessed Sacrament   (from  Philip Neri: The Fire of Joy  by Paul Türks, C.O. )   "When Philip became a priest, the Council of Trent had been meeting for six years. One of its chief and necessary tasks was the reform of the clergy. Jesuits had returned from missionary journeys in Italy with shocking reports. There were priests who had purchased their offices with a gift to the bishop, and who then mumbled an unintelligible gibberish at the altar instead of Latin. The morals of Roman priests were the subject of jokes all over Europe. In Rome itself priests rarely wore priestly attire, competing instead with the most elegant laity in wearing the latest and showiest fashions.   The Council required all candidates for the priesthood in Rome to take an examination. This posed no difficulty for Philip. Persiano Rosa had overseen his preparation. Now in San Girolamo he had free room and board, with no salary to be sure, but plenty of freedom just what he needed. Now he celebrated holy Mass daily, and this daily celebration was itself something unusual, even at San Girolamo. It should be said that it was precisely the possibility of celebrating the sacrifice of the Mass and this privilege alone that had drawn Philip to the priesthood - and yet had terrified him.   In San Girolamo Philip asked to celebrate the last Mass of the day, which was near noontime. The reason for this was more than his desire to leave the morning free for hearing the many confessions which soon became his major apostolate. The real reason was his desire to celebrate Mass with as few people present as possible - ideally alone. At that late hour he could celebrate at the high altar, where no one would be able to see his face. This unusual practice of Philips pointed to a characteristic that was very deep in Philip and that he always wished to keep hidden, but which shone forth in his whole life: his deep devotion to the Eucharist, his love for the Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. This love was already apparent in his prayer before the Lord in the monstrance at the Forty Hours Devotion. It showed itself also in the spread of the practice of frequent, even daily Communion, which Cacciaguerra and Philip encouraged. How much the Eucharist meant to him is indicated by the number of witnesses in the Process of Canonization who remarked upon it.   No one who had attended a Mass celebrated by him could forget the experience. His closest friends saw it as an act of providence that the last day of his life was the feast of Corpus Christi. "  " Ecco il mio amore ! Ecco il mio amore ! "  - (Here is my Love ! Here is my Love !) - St. Philip Neri, upon receiving Our Lord as Viaticum

       It's Holy Thursday...  which means a group from the Oratory (students and others, led by Frs. Joseph and Michael) will be making the Seven Churches Visit . This beautiful and widespread Catholic custom is one of my favorite parts of Holy Week. For anyone not familiar with it, it consists a group of people traveling to seven different Catholic churches after the Mass on Holy Thursday evening to visit Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament at each one. If done properly, the whole thing should be finished by midnight. The Fathers try to choose different beautiful, historic, or interesting churches to visit each time. Many churches in this area do this Holy Thursday night.  (Note: this custom is only feasible in areas where Catholics are relatively thick on the ground !)    Interestingly enough, it appears to be an adaptation of the Seven Churches pilgrimage St. Philip instituted and popularized in the Rome of his day, so it is very appropriate for Oratorians to lead it !

       Msgr. Ronald Knox, on Pontius Pilate   from  The Creed in Slow Motion  .   "There are only two human beings-merely human beings--who are referred to by name, whether in the Apostles' Creed or in the Nicene Creed which is said at Mass. One is our Blessed Lady, and that is natural enough. She is the touch-stone of Christian truth. I bet you don't know what a touch-stone is, though it's a word you are always coming across in books; I didn't myself till I looked it up just now in the dictionary. If you want to test the amount of gold or silver there is in something made of alloyed metal, a wristwatch it may be, or a half-crown, you get hold of a particular kind of stone, which is dark black, and you scratch your piece of metal along it-probably it makes a very unpleasant squeak, but that can't be helped-and you can tell by the colour of the scratch it makes whether your piece of metal was pure gold, pure silver, or how much it was alloyed with other metals. And when I call our Lady the touch-stone of Christian truth, I mean this-that if you remember to call our Blessed Lady the Mother of God, you won't be likely to fall into any error about the doctrine of the Incarnation. And if you meet somebody whom you suspect of holding queer views about the Incarnation, the best thing is to say, 'Of course, you do admit that the Blessed Virgin Mary was the Mother of God, don't you?' And if they hum and haw about it, you know that their ideas of the Incarnation are not good, hundred percent Catholic doctrine; your touch-stone has found them out.  But when it comes to Pontius Pilate, poor Pilate wasn't the touch-stone of anything; certainly not of truth-he didn't even believe in truth. I call him poor Pilate, because that is the way he always strikes me in the Gospel story. I know you see pictures of him, in the Stations of the Cross, for example, which seem to represent him as a very wicked man; but I can never think of him except as a hopelessly weak man, a fuffler and a shuffler who never ought to have got his job as procurator at all. The trouble about him, I suppose, was that he was so anxious to please everybody. He wanted to please Caiphas, he wanted to please the Jewish mob, he wanted to please his wife, he wanted to please Herod, he wanted to please our Lord, he wanted to please St. Joseph of Arimathea; and, like most people who want to please everybody, he pleased nobody....."

And it has been  urlLink reported  that while the Extended Edition of "The Fellowship of the Ring" film had 32 minutes of additonal footage, the Extended Edition of "The Two Towers" film will have  43 minutes  of extra footage.

       Interesting post  over at  urlLink the Contrarian . (Direct link is not working: See "The Honorable Pedigree of  Leftist English Catholics" ) I haven't read the book, but I think Mr. Wilson is underestimating the amount of time Venerable Newman spent in ministry to the poor. Here is a quote from Bishop Ullathorne of Birmingham's letter to the Venerable, upon the publication of  Apologia pro Vita Sua .  "The original plan of an oratory did not contemplate any parochial work, but you could not contemplate so many souls in want of pastors without being prompt and ready at the beck of authority to strain all your efforts in coming to their help. And this brings me to the third and the most continuous of those labours to which I have alluded. The mission in Alcester Street, its church and schools, were the first work of the Birmingham Oratory. After several years of close and hard work, and a considerable call upon the private resources of the Fathers who had established this congregation, it was delivered over to other hands, and the Fathers removed to the district of Edgbaston, where up to that time nothing Catholic had appeared. Then arose under your direction the large convent of the Oratory, the church expanded by degrees into its present capaciousness, a numerous congregation has gathered and grown in it; poor schools and other pious institutions have grown up in connexion with it, and, moreover, equally at your expense and that of your brethren, and, as I have reason to know, at much inconvenience, the Oratory has relieved the other clergy of Birmingham all this while by constantly doing the duty in the poor-house and gaol of Birmingham.  More recently still, the mission and the poor school at Smethwick owe their existence to the Oratory. And all this while the founder and father of these religious works has added to his other solicitudes the toil of frequent preaching, of attendance in the confessional, and other parochial duties. "   The same man who wrote magnificent prose and defended the Faith with such passion also spent a lot of his time doing pastoral work among desperately poor Irish immigrants.

       From the sermon notes  of the Venerable...  April 5 (Palm Sunday),1857   Falling Away 1. INTROD.Too awful a subject commonly, as leading [men] to despond; yet useful sometimes, and natural at this season.  2. Now first let us lay down about nature and grace[that] nature can do many things, but cannot bring to heaven. Grace is like a new nature, and joins us to the heavenly family; and they are saved who die with this grace; those lost who are without it.  3. This answers the question: Will good departed from avail? As some Protestants say, 'Look how a man lives, not how he dies'(explain).  4. Proof, Ezech. xviii. [24]. And rightly, for the sovereign Lord of heaven can prescribe His terms.  5. Now this chapter leads to a further thought, viz. that much as is said to encourage repentance, as much perhaps is said to warn against falling, as if the prospect, or chance, or issue on the whole were equal.  6. E.g. our Lord, 'I came not to call.' But on the other hand, recollect the number of passages such as 'Two shall be in the field'; 'Ten virgins'; 'He that persevereth,' etc.; 'Many that are first,' etc.  7. So St. Paul, preacher of repentance: but Heb. vi. [4-6] .  8. So holy Simeon, 'This child [for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel,' Luke ii. 34].  9. This text of holy Simeon especially fulfilled at Passion, when two special examples.  10. Multitude on Palm Sunday, vide their being in grace [implied] in the prayers [second and last] in the Blessing of Palms. Cp. our Lord's weepingdisappointment of the foolish virgins.  11. Judas. Our Lord chose him when he was in gracetrace about him'the ten indignant,' Mark x. 32, etc.   12. Some fall away at one age, some at another. Go through this.  13. On natural habits produced by supernatural acts deceiving the old.  14. Our Lady. Prayerpray lest we fall, if we fall, and for others.

        The Kingdom of God   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " 1. My Lord Jesus, how wonderful were those conversations which Thou didst hold from time to time with Thy disciples after Thy resurrection. When Thou wentest with two of them to Emmaus, Thou didst explain all the prophecies which related to Thyself. And Thou didst commit to the Apostles the Sacraments in fulness, and the truths which it was Thy will to reveal, and the principles and maxims by which Thy Church was to be maintained and governed. And thus Thou didst prepare them against the day of Pentecost (as the risen bodies were put into shape for the Spirit in the Prophet's Vision), when life and illumination was to be infused into them. I will think over all Thou didst say to them with a true and simple faith. The "kingdom of God" was Thy sacred subject. Let me never for an instant forget that Thou hast established on earth a kingdom of Thy own, that the Church is Thy work, Thy establishment, Thy instrument; that we are under Thy rule, Thy laws and Thy eyethat when the Church speaks Thou dost speak. Let not familiarity with this wonderful truth lead me to be insensible to itlet not the weakness of Thy human representatives lead me to forget that it is Thou who dost speak and act through them. It was just when Thou wast going away, that then Thou didst leave this kingdom of Thine to take Thy place on to the end of the world, to speak for Thee, as Thy visible form, when Thy Personal Presence, sensible to man, was departing. I will in true loving faith bring Thee before me, teaching all the truths and laws of this kingdom to Thy Apostles, and I will adore Thee, while in my thoughts I gaze upon Thee and listen to Thy words.  2. Come, O my dear Lord, and teach me in like manner. I need it not, and do not ask it, as far as this, that the word of truth which in the beginning was given to the Apostles by Thee, has been handed down from age to age, and has already been taught to me, and Thy Infallible Church is the warrant of it. But I need Thee to teach me day by day, according to each day's opportunities and needs. I need Thee to give me that true Divine instinct about revealed matters that, knowing one part, I may be able to anticipate or to approve of others. I need that understanding of the truths about Thyself which may prepare me for all Thy other truthsor at least may save me from conjecturing wrongly about them or commenting falsely upon them. I need the mind of the Spirit, which is the mind of the holy Fathers, and of the Church by which I may not only say what they say on definite points, but think what they think; in all I need to be saved from an originality of thought, which is not true if it leads away from Thee. Give me the gift of discriminating between true and false in all discourse of mind.  3. And, for that end, give me, O my Lord, that purity of conscience which alone can receive, which alone can improve Thy inspirations. My ears are dull, so that I cannot hear Thy voice. My eyes are dim, so that I cannot see Thy tokens. Thou alone canst quicken my hearing, and purge my sight, and cleanse and renew my heart. Teach me, like Mary, to sit at Thy feet, and to hear Thy word. Give me that true wisdom, which seeks Thy will by prayer and meditation, by direct intercourse with Thee, more than by reading and reasoning. Give me the discernment to know Thy voice from the voice of strangers, and to rest upon it and to seek it in the first place, as something external to myself; and answer me through my own mind, if I worship and rely on Thee as above and beyond it. "    Meditations and Devotions

       I'm afflicted with "middle-brow PBS Anglophilia"   and happy to be so. As matter of fact, I seldom quote from the particular authors cited by  urlLink  Relapsed Catholic   in her proposed moratorium, but continually quote from other authors of that mileu which she does not mention, such as Tolkien, Knox, and, somewhat further back in time, the Venerable.( Actually, quoting from the Venerable is one of the main ulterior motives of the blog.. if more people read him, more people may be motivated to find out more about him, and more people will pray for his canonization. How long, O Lord ? )  So, you can forget about any moratorium on quotes from English  Catholics in this corner.....

       Excerpt by the Professor for Easter..  From his essay,  "On Fairy-stories".... "It is not difficult to imagine the peculiar excitement and joy that one would feel, if any specially beautiful fairy-story were found to be 'primarily' ture, its narrative to be history, without necessarily losing the mythical or allegorical significance that it had possessed. It is not difficult, for one is not called upon to try and conceive anything of a quality unknown. The joy would have exactly the same quality, if not the same degree, as the joy which the 'turn' in a fairy-story gives: such joy has the very taste of primary truth. (Otherwise its name would not be joy.) It looks forward (or backward: the direction in this regard is unimportant) to the Great Eucatastrophe. The Christian joy, the  Gloria  , is of the same kind; but it is preeminently (infinitely, if our capacity were not finite) high and joyous. But this story is supreme; and it is true. Art has been verified. God is the Lord, of angels, and of men-and of elves. Legend and History have met and fused.   But in God's kingdom the presence of the greatest does not depress the small. Redeemed Man is still man. Story, fantasy, still go on, and should go on. The Evangelium has not abrogated legends; it has hallowed them, especially the 'happy ending'. The Christian has still to work, with mind as well as body, to suffer, hope and die; but he may now perceive that all his bents and faculties have a purpose, which can be redeemed. So great is the bounty with which he has been treated that he may now, perhaps, fairly dare to guess that in Fantasy he may actually assist in the effoliation and multiple enrichment of creation. All tales may come true; and yet, at the last, redeemed, they may be as like and unlike the forms that we give them as Man, finally redeemed, will be like and unlike the fallen that we know.

        For Saturday...    Prayer for  the Intercession of Our Lady of the Oratory, the Madonna of Vallicella    Mary, Mother of Jesus and our Mother, who does protect your faithful in difficult times and who showed yourself to be Mother of St. Philip Neri and his disciples, we who are gathered around your miraculous image ask you humbly to obtain for us from your Son the Spirit of Life;  let us pass unharmed in the presence of the ancient tempter; protect us from material and spiritual evils; let us journey toward our heavely home with burning hearts, and following our father, Philip, may we always conserve within us a love for the Eucharist and filial trust in you.  We most especially entrust to you the Church in Rome, in order that is may be respendent with the light of the Risen Christ; protect the Pope, the bishops, the priests, religious men and women and all the holy people of God, and help us so that, following your example, we may respond swiftly and generously to the word of the Lord.  Amen.     If you are wondering what the 'image' mentioned in the prayer is, click  urlLink  here.

       The Feast of St. Athanasius, Bishop and Doctor of the Church  is today. There is information on him  urlLink  here.   "And royal-hearted Athanase,  With Paul's own mantle blest."      - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. ,  The Greek Fathers   The Venerable had a great devotion to all the Fathers, but it seems that St. Athanasius was his favorite. He  urlLink  translated   urlLink  treatises  by the saint, and also referred to him in other works. When one of the Venerable's nephews was born on a May 2nd, he was thrilled, and begged his sister and her husband to name the baby Athanasius.  They named him Herbert. At least Athanasius would have been interesting....  ( Note: This was before the Venerable became Catholic-his sisters stopped speaking to him after his reception into the Church. One never reconciled with him, the other came around about twenty years later.)

       The Queen of Seasons     (A Song for an inclement May.)   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   All is divine which the Highest has made, Through the days that He wrought, till the day when He stay'd; Above and below, within and around, From the centre of space, to its uttermost bound.    In beauty surpassing the Universe smiled, On the morn of its birth, like an innocent child,  Or like the rich bloom  of some delicate flower;  And the Father rejoiced  in the work of His power.   Yet worlds brighter still,  and a brighter than those,  And a brighter again,  He had made, had He chose;  And you never could name  that conceivable best,  To exhaust the resources  the Maker possess'd.   But I know of one work  of His Infinite Hand,  Which special and singular  ever must stand;  So perfect, so pure,  and of gifts such a store,  That even Omnipotence  ne'er shall do more.   The freshness of May,  and the sweetness of June,  And the fire of July  in its passionate noon,  Munificent August,  September serene,  Are together no match  for my glorious Queen.   O Mary, all months  and all days are thine own,  In thee lasts their joyousness,  when they are gone;  And we give to thee May,  not because it is best,  But because it comes first,  and is pledge of the rest.    The Oratory. 1850.

        Now this is just getting completely out of hand...  The  urlLink  mini-balrogs  are multiplying. These are misspellings of Tolkienean words, found in fanfiction or other  Tolkien-related articles posted on the web. The enterprising lady known as "Camilla Sandman" has taken to collecting these, and the list  that I linked to above is hers.   Some are understandable as being simple typos. ("Esel", "Thédred", "Denthor"). However, I look at many of them, and simply shake my head. "Kazadoom" ? "Theodorin" ?  "Periguin" ? "Marroiodiac" ? What are these people   thinking  ?   I do admit, one new one did crack me up- a possible home for all mini-balrogs- "Muddle-urth" !

(No direct link available- See post for April 28, entitled " The relationship between the Resurrection and the Eucharist, as described by Cardinal Newman")  Now if this keeps spreading, maybe a critical mass of Venerable Newman awareness will be reached soon. Then millions of prayers for his canonization will soar heavenward, miracle reports will flood in, several will be confirmed, and he will be proclaimed a saint forthwith.  Just let me keep dreaming... sigh....

        On relics and relic distribution  Over at Amy Welborn's blog, there a  urlLink  post  about a disgrunltled ex-employee of an oncologist who alleges that her employer distributed slides with samples of the late Cardinal Cooke's blood to devotees of Cooke's  canonization cause. ( No direct link available. Please check under "Thursday, April 24" . )   Does anyone know what happened in the case ? Does the American legal system have a position on the ancient Catholic practice of venerating relics ?  I believe that giving out relics, third-class ones particularly,  is often a part of a canonization cause. ( I once found a card with a third-class relic of "Blessed Martin de Porres" tucked into a volume I had purchased at a Catholic used-book store. )  Do any of the Catholic lawyers out there have the answers ?  Of course, living in Pittsburgh, home of  urlLink  St. Anthony's Chapel  , I have a certain fondness for this practice many find so "P.O.D.", as  urlLink  Fr. Sibley  would put it. The Pittsburgh Oratory has three first-class relics of St. Philip Neri, including one which is  urlLink  simultaneously a second-class relic of Pope St. Pius X  . They also have a first-class relic of Venerable Newman (hair), and three second-class relics of him (two letters and one of his cassocks).   As for what the Venerable himself thought of relics, click  urlLink  here  , and  urlLink  here  .  .

       Mr. Shea  has a great article over at Catholic Exchange:   urlLink  Measuring Doctrine By Poetry   .   Venerable John Henry Newman wrote on a similar topic....   " Of all passions love is the most unmanageable; nay more, I would not give much for that love which is never extravagant, which always observes the proprieties, and can move about in perfect good taste, under all emergencies. What mother, what husband or wife, what youth or maiden in love, but says a thousand foolish things, in the way of endearment, which the speaker would be sorry for strangers to hear; yet they are not on that account unwelcome to the parties to whom they are addressed. Sometimes by bad luck they are written down, sometimes they get into the newspapers; and what might be even graceful, when it was fresh from the heart, and interpreted by the voice and the countenance, presents but a melancholy exhibition when served up cold for the public eye. So it is with devotional feelings. Burning thoughts and words are as open to criticism as they are beyond it. What is abstractedly extravagant, may in particular persons be becoming and beautiful, and only fall under blame when it is found in others who imitate them. When it is formalized into meditations or exercises, it is as repulsive as love-letters in a police report. Moreover, even holy minds readily adopt and become familiar with language which they would never have originated themselves, when it proceeds from a writer who has the same objects of devotion as they have; and, if they find a stranger ridicule or reprobate supplication or praise which has come to them so recommended, they feel it as keenly as if a direct insult were offered to those to whom that homage is addressed.

       Newman and Music  by Mr Philip Crossley  I found this on the website of  urlLink  The Birmingham Oratory  . I could not get a direct link to the article, so it is copied here instead.   "Newmans love of music is not in doubt: it was encouraged and fostered in his family circle; he took up the violin at the age of ten. His two brothers, Frank and Charles, used to accompany him in trios. At Ealing School he composed plays and then music for them. In 1815 he wrote a burlesque opera, composing tunes for the songs and in 1821 wrote to his mother: 'I am glad to be able to inform you that Signor Giovanni Enrico Neandrini has finished his first composition. The melody is light and airy and is well supported by the harmony'.      On going to Oxford he kept up his music and was a playing member of the music club at S. Johns which enjoyed weekly private concerts in the music room. Newman said in 1820: 'I was asked by a man yesterday to go to his rooms for a little music at seven oclock. I went. An old Don  played bass and through his enthusiasm I was kept playing quartets on a heavy tenor from seven to twelve. Oh my poor eyes and head and back'.      Newman composed instrumental trios at Littlemore, which he played together with John Walker and Mr Bowles.      Beethoven was his favourite composer and his preferences were for Handel, Romberg, Haydn, Mozart and Corelli; Palestrina, Animuccia and Cherubini he held in high regard. Gregorian chant he loved in the Mass but he wrote: 'the only fault will be that it admits no change, but is the same through the fifty-two Sundays of the year'. He was not attracted to Wagner, Brahms, Schubert or Schumann, having grown up with the music of the great 18th century composers. The Cardinal was fond of operatic music, but heard little of it, and when he had to make a choice as to what performances he would attend at the 1879 Festival, said: 'I shall go once and I choose 'Mose in Egitto'.      Those who read the late Mr Frank Haywards research into the Cardinals hymnology in this magazine in 1998/9 will be aware that of the seventeen hymns listed, six of the settings were Newmans own compositions and five were adaptations he made from other composers.      In 1877 at the opening of the new organ he preached a beautiful discourse upon the event of the day, and on music, first as a great natural gift and then as an instrument in the hands of the Church. After a performance in the church of Cherubinis First Requiem in C Minor in 1886, he said: 'It is magnificent musicbut when you get as old as I am, it comes rather too close to home'.

       If it were not Sunday   today would be the feast of St. John Houghton, who died on this day with the other martyrs of the London Charterhouse in 1535. There is information on him  urlLink  here.   While I love all of the English and Welsh martyrs, (and wish that the feast of the Forty Martyrs was at least given as an  option  on the US calendar), the fact that these Carthusians were the first ones to suffer, even before the magnificent St. John Fisher and the beloved St. Thomas More (who watched them being dragged to execution from his own cell),  makes them special in my eyes. The later martyrs, the wonderful Jesuits and seminary priests, went into enemy territory to fight the good fight knowing what they were up against. The Carthusians were living in a country that had been Catholic for a thousand years, quietly pursuing sanctity in prayer and solitude- and suddenly they were dragged into a politicized religious maelstrom, facing not just any death, but the sickening torture of hanging, drawing and quartering. (It must have been an incredible shock to those witnessing it as well..... imagine the inhabitants of a Catholic country seeing monks, still clad in their habits, being dragged, stripped, half-hanged, and dismembered...)  And St. John Houghton's last words, spoken while he was still conscious even though the butchers were ripping his body apart and tearing his heart from his chest, always make me cry... "And what wilt Thou do with my heart, O Christ?" ......

        Eight days to go..  Until St. Philip's Day.... I will post a prayer for his intercession written by Venerable Newman each day until the day itself.... "  May 17 Philip's Humility   If  Philip heard of anyone having committed a crime, he would say, 'Thank God that I have not done worse.'  At confession he would shed abundance of tears, and say, 'I have never done a good action.'  When a penitent showed that she could not bear the rudeness shown towards him by certain persons who were under great obligations to him, he answered her, 'If I were humble, God would not send this to me.'  When one of his spiritual children said to him, 'Father, I wish to have something of yours for devotion, for I know you are a Saint,' he turned to her with a face full of anger, and broke out into these words: 'Begone with you! I am a devil, and not a saint.'  To another who said to him, 'Father, a temptation has come to me to think that you are not what the world takes you for,' he made answer: "Be sure of this, that I am a man like my neighbours, and nothing more.'  If he heard of any who had a good opinion of him, he used to say, 'O poor me! how many poor girls will be greater in Paradise than I shall be!'  He avoided all marks of honour. He could not bear to receive any signs of respect. When people wished to touch his clothes, and knelt as he passed by, he used to say, 'Get up! get out of my way!' He did not like people to kiss his hand; though he sometimes let them do so, lest he should hurt their feelings.  He was an enemy to all rivalry and contention. He always took in good part everything that was said to him. He had a particular dislike of affectation, whether in speaking, or in dressing, or in anything else.  He could not bear two-faced persons; as for liars, he could not endure them, and was continually reminding his spiritual children to avoid them as they would a pestilence.  He always asked advice, even on affairs of minor importance. His constant counsel to his penitents was, that they should not trust in themselves, but always take the advice of others, and get as many prayers as they could.  He took great pleasure in being lightly esteemed, nay, even despised.  He had a most pleasant manner of transacting business with others, great sweetness in conversation, and was full of compassion and consideration.   He had always a dislike to speak of himself. The phrases " I said ," " I did ," were rarely in his mouth. He exhorted others never to make a display of themselves, especially in those things which tended to their credit, whether in earnest or in joke.  As St. John the Evangelist, when old, was continually saying, 'Little children, love one another,' so Philip was ever repeating his favourite lesson, "Be humble; think little of yourselves."  He said that if we did a good work, and another took the credit of it to himself, we ought to rejoice and thank God.  He said no one ought to say, 'Oh! I shall not fall, I shall not commit sin,' for it was a clear sign that he would fall. He was greatly displeased with those who made excuses for themselves, and called such persons 'My Lady Eve,' because Eve defended herself instead of being humble.  Prayer  Philip, my glorious patron, who didst count as dross the praise, and even the good esteem of men, obtain for me also, from my Lord and Saviour, this fair virtue by thy prayers. How haughty are my thoughts, how contemptuous are my words, how ambitious are my works. Gain for me that low esteem of self with which thou wast gifted; obtain for me a knowledge of my own nothingness, that I may rejoice when I am despised, and ever seek to be great only in the eyes of my God and Judge.

       Nine days before St. Philip's Day  Here's a lengthy quote from Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., on his (and my) founder....  " He lived in an age as traitorous to the interests of Catholicism as any that preceded it, or can follow it. He lived at a time when pride mounted high, and the senses held rule; a time when kings and nobles never had more of state and homage, and never less of personal responsibility and peril; when medieval winter was receding, and the summer sun of civilization was bringing into leaf and flower a thousand forms of luxurious enjoyment; when a new world of thought and beauty had opened upon the human mind, in the discovery of the treasures of classic literature and art. He saw the great and the gifted, dazzled by the Enchantress, and drinking in the magic of her song; he saw the high and the wise, the student and the artist, painting, and poetry, and sculpture, and music, and architecture, drawn within her range, and circling round the abyss: he saw heathen forms mounting thence, and forming in the thick air:all this he saw, and he perceived that the mischief was to be met, not with argument, not with science, not with protests and warnings, not by the recluse or the preacher, but by means of the great counter-fascination of purity and truth. He was raised up to do a work almost peculiar in the Church,not to be a Jerome Savonarola, though Philip had a true devotion towards him and a tender memory of his Florentine house; not to be a St. Charles (ed. Borromeo) , though in his beaming countenance Philip had recognized the aureole of a saint; not to be a St. Ignatius, wrestling with the foe, though Philip was termed the Society's bell of call, so many subjects did he send to it; not to be a St. Francis Xavier, though Philip had longed to shed his blood for Christ in India with him; not to be a St. Cajetan, or hunter, of souls, for Philip preferred, as he expressed it, tranquilly to cast in his net to gain them; he preferred to yield to the stream, and direct the current, which he could not stop, of science, literature, art, and fashion, and to sweeten and to sanctify what God had made very good and man had spoilt.  And so he contemplated as the idea of his mission, not the propagation of the faith, nor the exposition of doctrine, nor the catechetical schools; whatever was exact and systematic pleased him not; he put from him monastic rule and authoritative speech, as David refused the armour of his king. No; he would be but an ordinary individual priest as others: and his weapons should be but unaffected humility and unpretending love. All He did was to be done by the light, and fervour, and convincing eloquence of his personal character and his easy conversation. He came to the Eternal City and he sat himself down there, and his home and his family gradually grew up around him, by the spontaneous accession of materials from without. He did not so much seek his own as draw them to him. He sat in his small room, and they in their gay worldly dresses, the rich and the wellborn, as well as the simple and the illiterate, crowded into it. In the mid-heats of summer, in the frosts of winter, still was he in that low and narrow cell at San Girolamo, reading the hearts of those who came to him, and curing their souls' maladies by the very touch of his hand. It was a vision of the Magi worshipping the infant Saviour, so pure and innocent, so sweet and beautiful was he; and so loyal and so dear to the gracious Virgin Mother. And they who came remained gazing and listening, till at length, first one and then another threw off their bravery, and took his poor cassock and girdle instead: or, if they kept it, it was to put haircloth under it, or to take on them a rule of life, while to the world they looked as before.  In the words of his biographer, 'he was all things to all men. He suited himself to noble and ignoble, young and old, subjects and prelates, learned and ignorant; and received those who were strangers to him with singular benignity, and embraced them with as much love and charity as if he had been a long while expecting them. When he was called upon to be merry he was so; if there was a demand upon his sympathy he was equally ready. He gave the same welcome to all: caressing the poor equally with the rich, and wearying himself to assist all to the utmost limits of his power. In consequence of his being so accessible and willing to receive all comers, many went to him every day, and some continued for the space of thirty, nay forty years, to visit him very often both morning and evening, so that his room went by the agreeable nickname of the Home of Christian mirth. Nay, people came to him, not only from all parts of Italy, but from France, Spain, Germany, and all Christendom; and even the infidels and Jews, who had ever any communication with him, revered him as a holy man.' The first families of Rome, the Massimi, the Aldobrandini, the Colonnas, the Altieri, the Vitelleschi, were his friends and his penitents. Nobles of Poland, Grandees of Spain, Knights of Malta, could not leave Rome without coming to him. Cardinals, Archbishops, and Bishops were his intimates; Federigo Borromeo haunted his room and got the name of 'Father Philip's soul.' The Cardinal-Archbishops of Verona and Bologna wrote books in his honour. Pope Pius the Fourth died in his arms. Lawyers, painters, musicians, physicians, it was the same too with them. Baronius, Zazzara, and Ricci, left the law at his bidding, and joined his congregation, to do its work, to write the annals of the Church, and to die in the odour of sanctity. Palestrina had Father Philip's ministrations in his last moments. Animuccia hung about him during life, sent him a message after death, and was conducted by him through Purgatory to Heaven. And who was he, I say, all the while, but an humble priest, a stranger in Rome, with no distinction of family or letters, no claim of station or of office, great simply in the attraction with which a Divine Power had gifted him? and yet thus humble, thus unennobled, thus empty-handed, he has achieved the glorious title of Apostle of Rome.   Well were it for his clients and children, Gentlemen, it they could promise themselves the very shadow of his special power, or could hope to do a miserable fraction of the sort of work in which he was pre-eminently skilled. But so far at least they may attempt,to take his position, and to use his method, and to cultivate the arts of which he was so bright a pattern.

        The Feast of St. Brendan the Navigator  is today. There is information about him  urlLink  here.     Part of why I mention him here is because when I was young, I was fascinated by the writings of a gentleman named  urlLink  Tim Severin . After hearing the conventional wisdom that it was impossible for 6th century Irish monks to have reached the Americas, he built himself a  curragh  ( the type of leather boat St. Brendan would most probably have used), and proceeded to  urlLink  do it himself.    The other part is that the Professor was not only familiar with the St. Brendan story, but found it interesting enough to write a poem based upon it. I have not been able to find it in print, but from the descriptions I have read, it has St. Brendan visiting various islands, including one which bears some resemblance to Tol Eressëa.....

        Ten days  before St. Philip's Day... Since it is getting very close, I'll post a prayer written by Venerable Newman for his intercession:  "O my dear and holy Patron, Philip, I put myself into thy hands, and for the love of Jesus, for that loves sake which chose thee and made thee a saint, I implore thee to pray for me, that, as He has brought thee to heaven, so in due time He may take me to heaven too.  Thou hast had experience of the trials and troubles of this life; thou knowest well what it is to bear the assaults of the devil, the mockery of the world, and the temptations of flesh and blood. Thou knowest how weak is human nature, and how treacherous the human heart, and thou art so full of sympathy and compassion, that, amidst all thy present ineffable glory and blessedness, thou canst, I know, give a thought to me.  Think of me then, my dear St. Philip, be sure to think of me, even though I am at times so unmindful of thee. Gain for me all things necessary for my perseverance in the grace of God, and my eternal salvation. Gain for me, by thy powerful intercession,  the strength to fight a good fight, to witness boldly for God and religion in the midst of sinners, to be brave when Satan would frighten or force me to what is wrong, to overcome myself, to do my whole duty, and thus to be acquitted in the judgment.  Vessel of the Holy Ghost, Apostle of Rome, Saint of primitive times, pray for me. "

        The Venerable, on the aims of the world, and of the Church    " The world is content with setting right the surface of things; the Church aims at regenerating the very depths of the heart. She ever begins with the beginning; and, as regards the multitude of her children, is never able to get beyond the beginning, but is continually employed in laying the foundation. She is engaged with what is essential, as previous and as introductory to the ornamental and the attractive. She is curing men and keeping them clear of mortal sin; she is 'treating of justice and chastity, and the judgment to come:' she is insisting on faith and hope, and devotion, and honesty, and the elements of charity; and has so much to do with precept, that she almost leaves it to inspirations from Heaven to suggest what is of counsel and perfection. She aims at what is necessary rather than at what is desirable. She is for the many as well as for the few. She is putting souls in the way of salvation, that they may then be in a condition, if they shall be called upon, to aspire to the heroic, and to attain the full proportions, as well as the rudiments, of the beautiful.

       Just because  This was written by the Professor, in answer to something said by his friend C.S. Lewis, then an atheist.....    Mythopoeia    To one who said that myths were lies and therefore worthless, even though 'breathed through silver.'   Philomythus to Misomythus J.R.R.T. for C.S.L.   " You look at trees and label them just so, (for trees are 'trees,' and growing is 'to grow'); you walk the earth and tread with solemn pace one of the many minor globes of Space: a star's a star, some matter in a ball compelled to courses mathematical amid the regimented, cold, Inane, where destined atoms are each moment slain.   At bidding of a Will, to which we bend (and must), but only dimly apprehend, great processes march on, as Time unrolls from dark beginnings to uncertain goals; and as on page o'erwritten without clue, with script and limning packed of various hue, an endless multitude of forms appear, some grim, some frail, some beautiful, some queer, each alien, except as kin from one remote Origo, gnat, man, stone, and sun. God made the petrous rocks, the arboreal trees, tellurian earth, and stellar stars, and these homuncular men, who walk upon the ground with nerves that tingle touched by light and sound. The movements of the sea, the wind in boughs, green grass, the large slow oddity of cows, thunder and lightning, birds that wheel and cry, slime crawling up from mud to live and die, these each are duly registered and print the brain's contortions with a separate dint.   Yet trees are not 'trees,' until so named and seen -- and never were so named, till those had been who speech's involuted breath unfurled, faint echo and dim picture of the world, but neither record nor a photograph, being divination, judgement, and a laugh, response of those that felt astir within by deep monition movements that were kin to life and death of trees, of beasts, of stars: free captives undermining shadowy bars, digging the foreknown from experience and panning the vein of spirit out of sense. Great powers they slowly brought out of themselves, and looking backward they beheld the elves that wrought on cunning forges in the mind, and light and dark on secret looms entwined.   He sees no stars who does not see them first of living silver made that sudden burst to flame like flowers beneath an ancient song, whose very echo after music long has since pursued. There is no firmament, only a void, unless a jewelled tent myth-woven and elf-patterned; and no earth, unless the mother's womb whence all have birth.   The heart of man is not compound of lies, but draws some wisdom from the only Wise, and still recalls him. Though now long estranged, man is not wholly lost nor wholly changed. Dis-graced he may be, yet is not dethroned, and keeps the rags of lordship once he owned, his world-dominion by creative act: not his to worship the great Artefact, man, sub-creator, the refracted light through whom is splintered from a single White to many hues, and endlessly combined in living shapes that move from mind to mind. Though all the crannies of the world we filled with elves and goblins, though we dared to build gods and their houses out of dark and light, and sow the seeds of dragons, 'twas our right (used or misused). The right has not decayed. We make still by the law in which we're made.   Yes! 'wish-fulfilment dreams' we spin to cheat our timid hearts and ugly Fact defeat! Whence came the wish, and whence the power to dream, or some things fair and others ugly deem? All wishes are not idle, nor in vain fulfilment we devise -- for pain is pain not for itself to be desired, but ill; or else to strive or to subdue the will alike were graceless; and of Evil this alone is dreadly certain: Evil is.   Blessed are the timid hearts that evil hate, that quail in its shadow, and yet shut the gate; that seek no parley, and in guarded room, though small and bare, upon a clumsy loom weave tissues gilded by the far-off day hoped and believed in under Shadow's sway.   Blessed are the men of Noah's race that build their little arks, though frail and poorly filled, and steer through winds contrary towards a wraith, a rumour of a harbour guessed by faith.   Blessed are the legend-makers with their rhyme of things not found within recorded time. It is not they that have forgot the Night, or bid us flee to organized delight, in lotus-isles of economic bliss forswearing souls to gain a Circe-kiss (and counterfeit at that, machine-produced, bogus seduction of the twice seduced). Such isles they saw afar, and ones more fair, and those that hear them yet may yet beware. They have seen Death and ultimate defeat, and yet they would not in despair retreat, but oft to victory have turned the lyre and kindled hearts with legendary fire, illuminating Now and dark Hath-been with light of suns as yet by no man seen.   I would that I might with the minstrels sing and stir the unseen with a throbbing string. I would be with the mariners of the deep that cut their slender planks on mountains steep and voyage upon a vague and wandering quest, for some have passed beyond the fabled West. I would with the beleaguered fools be told, that keep an inner fastness where their gold, impure and scanty, yet they loyally bring to mint in image blurred of distant king, or in fantastic banners weave the sheen heraldic emblems of a lord unseen.   I will not walk with your progressive apes, erect and sapient. Before them gapes the dark abyss to which their progress tends -- if by God's mercy progress ever ends, and does not ceaselessly revolve the same unfruitful course with changing of a name. I will not treat your dusty path and flat, denoting this and that by this and that, your world immutable wherein o part the little maker has with maker's art. I bow not yet before the Iron Crown, nor cast my own small golden scepter down.   *   In Paradise perchance the eye may stray from gazing upon everlasting Day to see the day-illumined, and renew from mirrored truth the likeness of the True. Then looking on the Blessed Land 'twill see that all is as it is, and yet made free: Salvation changes not, nor yet destroys, garden nor gardener, children nor their toys. Evil will not see, for evil lies not in God's picture but in crooked eyes, not in the source but in malicious choice, and not in sound but in the tuneless voice. In Paradise they no more look awry; and though they make anew, they make no lie. Be sure they still will make, not being dead, and poets shall have flames upon their head, and harps whereon their faultless fingers fall: there each shall choose for ever from the All."   Thanks to  urlLink  Gazing Upon Everlasting Day  for this.

       Over at  Pro Deo et Patria     urlLink  Mr. William Cork  posted a link to  urlLink  prayers for priests and for priestly vocations.  I'm reposting the link, not only because these are intentions which need much prayer, but also because of the lovely icon-type illustration. When I saw that, in black-and-white, in the  Adoremus Bulletin , I thought ' gee, that might make a great ordination present ! '  Well, I ordered it, had it mounted, and gave it to Fr. Michael, along with a copy of  The Pastoral and Occasional Sermons of Ronald Knox  . ( He's an Oratorian- he already had  the Venerable's sermons. ) It is much more impressive in a larger size !

        May 12, 1879  was the day John Henry Newman was elevated to the Cardinalate. His  Biglietto Speech   may be found  urlLink  here  . His titular church was San Giorgio in Velabro, which I blogged about  urlLink  here.    The Venerable wrote about his reason for accepting the honor in a letter to his friend Dean Church earlier in the year...  "  Haec mutatio dexterae Excelsi !   all the stories which have gone about of my being a half Catholic, a Liberal Catholic, under a cloud, not to be trusted, are now at an end ... It was on this account that I dared not refuse the offer. A good Providence gave me an opportunity of clearing myself of former calumnies in my 'Apologia'and I dared not refuse it. And now He gave me a means, without any labour of mine, to set myself right as regards other calumnies which were directed against mehow could I neglect so great a loving kindness?  I have ever tried to leave my cause in the Hands of God and to be patientand He has not forgotten me. "

        For Mother's Day...  A meditation on the mother of all Christians by the Venerable...   Mary is the "Mater Christi," the Mother of Christ   "Each of the titles of Mary has its own special meaning and drift, and may be made the subject of a distinct meditation. She is invoked by us as the  Mother of Christ . What is the force of thus addressing her? It is to bring before us that she it is whom from the first was prophesied of, and associated with the hopes and prayers of all holy men, of all true worshippers of God, of all who 'looked for the redemption of Israel' in every age before that redemption came.  Our Lord was called the Christ, or the Messias, by the Jewish prophets and the Jewish people. The two words Christ and Messias mean the same. They mean in English the 'Anointed.'In the old time there were three great ministries or offices by means of which God spoke to His chosen people, the Israelites, or, as they were afterward called, the Jews, viz., that of Priest, that of King, and that of Prophet. Those who were chosen by God for one or other of these offices were solemnly anointed with oiloil signifying the grace of God, which was given to them for the due performance of their high duties. But our Lord was all three, a Priest, a Prophet, and a Kinga Priest, because He offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins; a Prophet, because He revealed to us the Holy Law of God; and a King, because He rules over us. Thus He is the one true Christ.  It was in expectation of this great Messias that the chosen people, the Jews, or Israelites, or Hebrews (for these are different names for the same people), looked out from age to age. He was to come to set all things right. And next to this great question which occupied their minds, namely,  When  was He to come, was the question,  Who  was to be His Mother? It had been told them from the first, not that He should come from heaven, but that He should be born of a Woman. At the time of the fall of Adam, God had said that the  seed  of the  Woman  should bruise the Serpent's head. Who, then, was to be that Woman thus significantly pointed out to the fallen race of Adam? At the end of many centuries, it was further revealed to the Jews that the great Messias, or Christ, the seed of the Woman, should be born of their race, and of one particular tribe of the twelve tribes into which that race was divided. From that time every woman of that tribe hoped to have the great privilege of herself being the Mother of the Messias, or Christ; for it stood to reason, since He was so great, the Mother must be great, and good, and blessed too. Hence it was, among other reasons, that they thought so highly of the marriage state, because, not knowing the mystery of the miraculous conception of the Christ when He was actually to come, they thought that the marriage rite was the ordinance necessary for His coming.  Hence it was, if Mary had been as other women, she would have longed for marriage, as opening on her the prospect of bearing the great King. But she was too humble and too pure for such thoughts. She had been inspired to choose that better way of serving God which had not been made known to the Jewsthe state of Virginity. She preferred to be His Spouse to being His Mother. Accordingly, when the Angel Gabriel announced to her her high destiny, she shrank from it till she was assured that it would not oblige her to revoke her purpose of a virgin life devoted to her God.  Thus was it that she became the Mother of the Christ, not in that way which pious women for so many ages had expected Him, but, declining the grace of such maternity, she gained it by means of a higher grace. And this is the full meaning of St. Elizabeth's words, when the Blessed Virgin came to visit her, which we use in the Hail Mary: 'Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.' And therefore it is that in the Devotion called the  'Crown of Twelve Stars'   we give praise to God the Holy Ghost, through whom she was  both  Virgin  and  Mother.

She apparently had recommended that he get an unlisted phone number.... "Thank you very much for your suggestion about my telephone number, which I will consider. Removing the number from the directory seems better than the method adopted by Major W.H.

        Almost...  One more day before St. Philip's Day.... Here's the meditation and prayer by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. ..... " May 24 Philip's Care for the Salvation of Souls   When he was a young priest, and had gathered about him a number of spiritual persons, his first wish was to go with them all to preach the gospel to the heathen of India, where St. Francis Xavier was engaged in his wonderful careerand he only gave up the idea in obedience to the holy men whom he consulted.  As to bad Christians at home, such extreme desire had he for their conversion, that even when he was old he took severe disciplines in their behalf, and wept for their sins as if they had been his own.  While a layman, he converted by one sermon thirty dissolute youths.  He was successful, under the grace of God, in bringing back almost an infinite number of sinners to the paths of holiness. Many at the hour of death cried out, 'Blessed be the day when first I came to know Father Philip!' Others, 'Father Philip draws souls to him as the magnet draws iron.'   With a view to the fulfilment of what he considered his special mission, he gave himself up entirely to hearing confessions, exclusive of every other employment. Before sunrise he had generally confessed a good number of penitents in his own room. He went down into the church at daybreak, and never left it till noon, except to say Mass. If no penitents came, he remained near his confessional, reading, saying office, or telling his beads. If he was at prayer, if at his meals, he at once broke off when his penitents came.  He never intermitted his hearing of confessions for any illness, unless the physician forbade it.  For the same reason he kept his room-door open, so that he was exposed to the view of everyone who passed it.  He had a particular anxiety about boys and young men. He was most anxious to have them always occupied, for he knew that idleness was the parent of every evil. Sometimes he made work for them, when he could not find any.  He let them make what noise they pleased about him, if in so doing he was keeping them from temptation. When a friend remonstrated with him for letting them so interfere with him, he made answer: 'So long as they do not sin, they may chop wood upon my back.'  He was allowed by the Dominican Fathers to take out their novices for recreation. He used to delight to see them at their holiday meal. He used to say, 'Eat, my sons, and do not scruple about it, for it makes me fat to watch you;' and then, when dinner was over, he made them sit in a ring around him, and told them the secrets of their hearts, and gave them good advice, and exhorted them to virtue.  He had a remarkable power of consoling the sick, and of delivering them from the temptations with which the devil assails them.  To his zeal for the conversion of souls, Philip always joined the exercise of corporal acts of mercy. He visited the sick in the hospitals, served them in all their necessities, made their beds, swept the floor round them, and gave them their meals.  Prayer  Philip, my holy Patron, who wast so careful for the souls of thy brethren, and especially of thy own people, when on earth, slack not thy care of them now, when thou art in heaven. Be with us, who are thy children and thy clients; and, with thy greater power with God, and with thy more intimate insight into our needs and our dangers, guide us along the path which leads to God and to thee. Be to us a good father; make our priests blameless and beyond reproach or scandal; make our children obedient, our youth prudent and chaste, our heads of families wise and gentle, our old people cheerful and fervent, and build us up, by thy powerful intercessions, in faith, hope, charity, and all virtues."    Meditations and Devotions

       The May   First Things   is now  urlLink  online  . I found the article by Avery Cardinal Dulles  urlLink  most interesting.   And this quote from The Public Square is to be cherished... " This is unusual television fare. Promoting an upcoming segment on  Dateline , Jane Pauley said, 'Still ahead, the latest round of bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics.' At last they are going to show what really happens at abortuaries: cutting bodies of babies in pieces, plucking out the bloody limbs one by one, puncturing the heads of infants and sucking out the brains. At last, one thought, at least one network has the nerve to tell the truth about abortion. Then Ms. Pauley completed her message: 'The anti-abortion movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a decade.' "

        Oh,   please !     urlLink  Lane Core  gives a  urlLink  link  to a book review. The review seems fair enough, but the book sounds exasperating, at least in part. That "rich, majestic and holy kingdom" was engaged in, among other things,  urlLink  putting Catholic priests to slow and excruciating deaths.     A quote from Msgr. Ronald Knox seems apt....( He was commenting on his own country-England- but it's close enough...)  "The losing side is wrong, because it lost; William of Normandy was a patriot, Philip of Spain a tyrant. The Reformation may be cherished by its devotees because the fires of Smithfield failed; it is recommended to the hearts of Englishmen because the hangings at Tyburn suceeded. For, as a race, we pay homage to the  fait acompli  . "

        Nearly there..   Two days to go until St. Philip's Day...the meditation and prayer from the Venerable, as usual, follow... (BTW, Venerable Newman had a   lot  of opportunites to imitate his patron in practicing this particular virtue !)    " May 23 Philip's Patience   Philip was for years and years the butt and laughing-stock of all the hangers-on of the great palaces of the nobility at Rome, who said all the bad of him that came into their heads, because they did not like to see a virtuous and conscientious man.  This sarcastic talk against him lasted for years and years; so that Rome was full of it, and through all the shops and counting-houses the idlers and evil livers did nothing but ridicule Philip.  When they fixed some calumny upon him, he did not take it in the least amiss, but with the greatest calmness contented himself with a simple smile.  Once a gentleman's servant began to abuse him so insolently that a person of consideration, who witnessed the insult, was about to lay hands on him; but, when he saw with what gentleness and cheerfulness Philip took it, he restrained himself, and ever after counted Philip as a saint.  Sometimes his own spiritual children, and even those who lay under the greatest obligations to him, treated him as if he were a rude and foolish person; but he did not show any resentment.  Once, when he was Superior of the Congregation, one of his subjects snatched a letter out of his hand; but the saint took the affront with incomparable meekness, and neither in look, nor word, nor in gesture betrayed the slightest emotion.  Patience had so completely become a habit with him, that he was never seen in a passion. He checked the first movement of resentful feeling; his countenance calmed instantly, and he reassumed his usual modest smile.  Prayer  Philip, my holy Advocate, who didst bear persecution and calumny, pain and sickness, with so admirable a patience, gain for me the grace of true fortitude under all the trials of this life. Alas! how do I need patience! I shrink from every small inconvenience; I sicken under every light affliction; I fire up at every trifling contradiction; I fret and am cross at every little suffering of body. Gain for me the grace to enter with hearty good-will into all such crosses as I may receive day by day from my Heavenly Father. Let me imitate thee, as thou didst imitate my Lord and Saviour, that so, as thou hast attained heaven by thy calm endurance of bodily and mental pain, I too may attain the merit of patience, and the reward of life everlasting.

       Three more days  before St. Philip's Day.... and here's the meditation and prayer by Venerable Newman...  May 22 Philip's Cheerfulness   Philip welcomed those who consulted him with singular benignity, and received them, though strangers, with as much affection as if he had been a long time expecting them. When he was called upon to be merry, he was merry; when he was called upon to feel sympathy with the distressed, he was equally ready.  Sometimes he left his prayers and went down to sport and banter with young men, and by this sweetness and condescension and playful conversation gained their souls.  He could not bear anyone to be downcast or pensive, because spirituality is always injured by it; but when he saw anyone grave and gloomy, he used to say, 'Be merry.' He had a particular and marked leaning to cheerful persons.  At the same time he was a great enemy to anything like rudeness or foolery; for a buffooning spirit not only does not advance in religion, but roots out even what is already there.   One day he restored cheerfulness to Father Francesco Bernardi, of the Congregation, by simply asking him to run with him, saying, 'Come now, let us have a run together.'  His penitents felt that joy at being in his room that they used to say, Philip's room is not a room, but an earthly Paradise.  To others, to merely stand at the door of his room, without going in, was a release from all their troubles. Others recovered their lost peace of mind by simply looking Philip in the face. To dream of him was enough to comfort many. In a word, Philip was a perpetual refreshment to all those who were in perplexity and sadness.  No one ever saw Philip melancholy; those who went to him always found him with a cheerful and smiling countenance, yet mixed with gravity.  When he was ill he did not so much receive as impart consolation. He was never heard to change his voice, as invalids generally do, but spoke in the same sonorous tone as when he was well. Once, when the physicians had given him over, he said, with the Psalmist, ' Paratus sum et non sum turbatus ' ('I am ready, and am not troubled'). He received Extreme Unction four times, but with the same calm and joyous countenance.  Prayer  Philip, my glorious Advocate, who didst ever follow the precepts and example of the Apostle St. Paul in rejoicing always in all things, gain for me the grace of perfect resignation to God's will, of indifference to matters of this world, and a constant sight of Heaven; so that I may never be disappointed at the Divine providences, never desponding, never sad, never fretful; that my countenance may always be open and cheerful, and my words kind and pleasant, as becomes those who, in whatever state of life they are, have the greatest of all goods, the favour of God and the prospect of eternal bliss.

        Since we are rehearsing the music for St. Philip's Day tonight..  I thought I'd post this....(It's from the site of the  urlLink  Birmingham Oratory , but a direct link does not work, so I am posting it here...)    Saint Philip and Music  by Father Guy Nicholls, C.O.    Those who come regularly to the Birmingham Oratory know what store the Catholic church sets by music and art. The sixteenth century provided the very best of both. Yet it is important to recall that the sixteenth century began in turmoil in western Christendom. The reformation period was one of crisis for the Catholic church, and art, music and architecture all suffered as a result. Yet by the end of that century the church had regained her confidence, and we can all marvel at the wonderful achievements of the Baroque which was the outward expression of this new era of growth and confidence.      Undoubtedly one of the key figures in bringing about this change was Saint Philip. Although he was not himself a practitioner of the arts, excepting his poetical skills, of which, alas, little remains because he caused most of his sonnets to be destroyed, Philip was nonetheless an enthusiast for the arts. He encouraged many artists and musicians in their work. But there can be no doubt that he held music in especially high esteem. As one Oratorian biographer writes:      Our saint was profoundly convinced that there is in music and in song a mysterious and a mighty power to sir the heart with high and noble emotions, and an especial fitness to raise it above to the love of heavenly things.       Saint Philip attracted a fellowship of young men around himself each day to pray. The pattern of this prayer was largely informal and devotional. From the very beginning musicians were among their number, and Philip never lost an opportunity to employ their talents in order to give spiritual refreshment to the meetings. In the early days of the Oratory, soon after Philips priestly ordination in 1551, the music was usually in vernacular Italian, suiting the informal nature of the gatherings. These were simple pieces known as  laudi spirituali   or spiritual praises, familiar from his Florentine youth, though new to Rome.      Sometimes, especially on Sundays and feast-days, Philip would take his band of followers out on walks, often to some of the churches in the nearby countryside close to his beloved catacombs. They would sing  laudi   and litanies on the way, and stop to play games and have a picnic liberally spiced with prayer and music. The musicians, who often came from the Papal choirs, would sing some of their motets for the group. First among these was Giovanni Animuccia, who like Philip was a Florentine by birth, and had come to Rome to seek his fortune with the Papal Court. In this he was successful, since in 1555 he succeeded the great Palestrina as master of the  Capella Giulia  , the choir which sang daily for the services in S. Peters. Animuccia remained Philips closest musician friend until his untimely death in 1571, and Philip was able to tell his sorrowing widow that he had seen Animuccias soul leave purgatory for the joys of heaven.      As the Oratory became more famous, the music became more elaborate. Instrumentalists added splendour to the meetings. Sometimes Palestrina himself came to direct the choir, and it is believed that Philip was present with him when he died in 1594, the year before Philips own death. Some of Palestrinas own music seems to have been inspired by Philip; for instance, his  madrigali spirituali   and the wonderful settings of texts from the  Song of Songs ,  a book which Philip especially loved to expound in the Oratory.      Some of his musical followers became priests. The Spaniard Soto de Langa, who was renowned for his beautiful voice and writing  laudi , joined Philip in his priestly community. Another Spaniard living in Rome at this time was the great Tomas Luis de Victoria. Although he was never formally attached to S. Philips community, he lived with S. Philip at San Girolamo for several years after his ordination in 1575, and it is more than likely that he took part in the musical activities of the Oratory held in the very house where he lived until his return to Spain in 1587.      Saint Philips friendship with these giants of Church music reminds us once more that he played a significant if hidden rôle in the Catholic revival. Philip lived in Rome throughout the period of the Council of Trent, which was to reinvigorate Catholic life. This renewal of Catholicism owed much to S. Philips untiring apostolate among both the laity and clergy. Many of the great churchmen of the day became his close friends and admirers. They modelled their own lives as pastors on his. But there is no doubt that it was his spiritual appreciation of the power of music that helped to bring about the great flowering of liturgical and devotional music that has never been surpassed.      It is well known that the Fathers of the Council of Trent considered a drastic reform of church music in the light of some of its more elaborate and unspiritual manifestations. There is a familiar, though apocryphal story that Palestrina composed the great  Missa Papæ Marcelli   in order to show that church music could be both magnificent and spiritually profound. As Italians say:  se non e vero, e ben trovato ,  which can be roughly rendered: if its not true, it ought to be. It certainly is the case that composers under Philips spell were able to produce music in no way inferior to any that had yet been composed for the worship of God, which could be a wonderful vehicle for prayer and praise, and for the consolation and needs of many.      The musical  oratorio , which was to become the vehicle for some of the most profound spiritual expressions of his own and later ages, although not exclusively conceived of in Saint Philips Oratory, was nevertheless a happy invention of the Rome he helped to reform.      Finally, however, we cannot forget that a new generation of composers was to arise to build on the magnificent foundations of Palestrina, Victoria, and the undeservedly neglected Animuccia. Also disciples of S. Philip were Giovanni Francesco Anerio and his brother Felice, who both were to become Papal choirmasters, and they were sons of Mautizio Anerio, who was one of Philips earliest followers in the Oratory. Their mother, Fulginia even did Philips laundry all her life. When Giovanni Francesco published his collection of spiritual madrigals in 1619, he wrote an introduction which contains a clear indication of their origin in the Oratory services and beautifully sums up S. Philips own philosophy of music. Having praised Philip for,  drawing souls to the perfect love and fear of God, . . making known to them the ugliness of sin, . . the beauty of the blessed souls, and the reward of eternal glory,  he is then moved to address his dear patron in person:      And to attain the desired aim so much more easily, and to draw, with a sweet deception, the sinners to the holy exercises of the Oratory, you introduced music there, seeing to it that the vernacular and devotional things were sung, so that people, being allured by song and tender words, would be all the more disposed to spiritual profit; nor was it your idea in vain, since some, coming at times to the Oratory only to hear the music, and then remaining, moved and captivated by the sermons and the other holy exercises that were done there, have become servants of God.

        Prayer request  Prayers for Fr. Bryan would be welcome. He was invited down to southern Texas by the Fathers of the Pharr Oratory, to give the commencement speech at the high school run by the Fathers there. Unfortunately, he is recovering from a bout of laryngitis, and his voice is still somewhat weak. The graduation is tommorow. ( He will, of course, be coming back soon afterwards, so as to be home for St. Philip's Day...)

        The Feast of St. Rita of Cascia  is today. There is information on her  urlLink  here.   I actually have a St. Rita story- years ago, my mother was driving around in a mall parking lot on the day after Thanksgiving. (Don't ask.) I was in the passenger seat,  getting more and more frustrated as time went on. After about half an hour of driving up and down completely filled rows, I thought of St. Rita's patronage of those with impossible causes, and cried out, 'St. Rita of Cascia, intercede for us !'   The   second   after the words had left my lips, someone pulled out of his parking space- immediately in front of us, so that we could pull in very easily.  I know, it's not exactly a big deal, but it impressed me at the time....

        Four days to go...  until St. Philip's Day... and the meditations and prayers by Venerable Newman continue below...   " May 21 Philip's Tenderness of Heart   Philip could not endure the very sight of suffering; and though he abhorred riches, he always wished to have money to give in alms.  He could not bear to see children scantily clothed, and did all he could to get new clothes for them.  Oppressed and suffering innocence troubled him especially; when a Roman gentleman was falsely accused of having been the death of a man, and was imprisoned, he went so far as to put his cause before the Pope, and obtained his liberation.  A priest was accused by some powerful persons, and was likely to suffer in consequence. Philip took up his cause with such warmth that he established his innocence before the public.  Another time, hearing of some gipsies who had been unjustly condemned to hard labour, he went to the Pope, and procured their freedom. His love of justice was as great as his tenderness and compassion.  Soon after he became a Priest there was a severe famine in Rome, and six loaves were sent to him as a present. Knowing that there was in the same house a poor foreigner suffering from want of food, he gave them all to him, and had for the first day nothing but olives to eat.  Philip had a special tenderness towards artisans, and those who had a difficulty of selling their goods. There were two watchmakers, skilful artists, but old and burdened with large families. He gave them a large order for watches, and contrived to sell them among his friends.  His zeal and liberality specially shone forth towards poor girls. He provided for them when they had no other means of provision. He found marriage dowries for some of them; to others he gave what was sufficient to gain their admittance into convents.  He was particularly good to prisoners, to whom he sent money several times in the week.  He set no limits to his affection for the shrinking and bashful poor, and was more liberal in his alms towards them.  Poor students were another object of his special compassion; he provided them not only with food and clothing, but also with books for their studies. To aid one of them he sold all his own books.  He felt most keenly any kindness done to him, so that one of his friends said: 'You could not make Philip a present without receiving another from him of double value.'  He was very tender towards brute animals. Seeing someone put his foot on a lizard, he cried out, 'Cruel fellow! what has that poor animal done to you?'   Seeing a butcher wound a dog with one of his knives, he could not contain himself, and had great difficulty in keeping himself cool.  He could not bear the slightest cruelty to be shown to brute animals under any pretext whatever. If a bird came into the room, he would have the window opened that it might not be caught.  Prayer  Philip, my glorious Advocate, teach me to look at all I see around me after thy pattern as the creatures of God. Let me never forget that the same God who made me made the whole world, and all men and all animals that are in it. Gain me the grace to love all God's works for God's sake, and all men for the sake of my Lord and Saviour who has redeemed them by the Cross. And especially let me be tender and compassionate and loving towards all Christians, as my brethren in grace. And do thou, who on earth was so tender to all, be especially tender to us, and feel for us, bear with us in all our troubles, and gain for us from God, with whom thou dwellest in beatific light, all the aids necessary for bringing us safely to Him and to thee.

        Five days left  before St. Philip's Day...  The meditation and prayer by Venerable Newman follow...  "   May 20 Philip's Purity   Philip, well knowing the pleasure which God takes in cleanness of heart, had no sooner come to years of discretion, and to the power of distinguishing between good and evil, than he set himself to wage war against the evils and suggestions of his enemy, and never rested till he had gained the victory. Thus, notwithstanding he lived in the world when young, and met with all kinds of persons, he preserved his virginity spotless in those dangerous years of his life.  No word was ever heard from his lips which would offend the most severe modesty, and in his dress, his carriage, and countenance, he manifested the same beautiful virtue.  One day, while he was yet a layman, some profligate persons impudently tempted him to commit sin. When he saw that flight was impossible, he began to speak to them of the hideousness of sin and the awful presence of God. This he did with such manifest distress, such earnestness, and such fervour, that his words pierced their abandoned hearts as a sword, and not only persuaded them to give up their horrible thought, but even reclaimed them from their evil ways.  At another time some bad men, who are accustomed to think no one better than themselves, invited him on some pretext into their house, under the belief that he was not what the world took him to be; and then, having got possession of him, thrust him into a great temptation. Philip, in this strait, finding the doors locked, knelt down and began to pray to God with such astonishing fervour and heartfelt heavenly eloquence, that the two poor wretches who were in the room did not dare to speak to him, and at last themselves left him and gave him a way to escape.  His virginal purity shone out of his countenance. His eyes were so clear and bright, even to the last years of his life, that no painter ever succeeded in giving the expression of them, and it was not easy for anyone to keep looking on him for any length of time, for he dazzled them like an Angel of Paradise.  Moreover, his body, even in his old age, emitted a fragrance which, even in his decrepit old age, refreshed those who came near him; and many said that they felt devotion infused into them by the mere smell of his hands.  As to the opposite vice, the ill odour of it was not to the Saint a mere figure of speech, but a reality, so that he could detect those whose souls were blackened by it; and he used to say that it was so horrible that nothing in the world could equal it, nothing, in short, but the Evil Spirit himself. Before his penitents began their confession he sometimes said, 'O my son, I know your sins already.'  Many confessed that they were at once delivered from temptations by his merely laying his hands on their heads. The very mention of his name had a power of shielding from Satan those who were assailed by his fiery darts.  He exhorted men never to trust themselves, whatever experience they might have of themselves, or however long their habits of virtue.  He used to say that humility was the true guard of chastity; and that not to have pity for another in such cases was a forerunner of a speedy fall in ourselves; and that when he found a man censorious, and secure of himself, and without fear, he gave him up for lost.  Prayer  Philip, my glorious Patron, who didst ever keep unsullied the white lily of thy purity, with such jealous care that the majesty of this fair virtue beamed from thine eyes, shone in thy hands, and was fragrant in thy breath, obtain for me that gift from the Holy Ghost, that neither the words nor the example of sinners may ever make any impression on my soul. And, since it is by avoiding occasions of sin, by prayer, by keeping myself employed, and by the frequent use of the Sacraments that my dread enemy must be subdued, gain for me the grace to persevere in these necessary observances."

        Down to six days  before St. Philip's Day... and here is the meditation and prayer by the Venerable...   " May 19 Philip's Exercise of Prayer   From very boyhood the servant of God gave himself up to prayer, until he acquired such a habit of it, that, wherever he was, his mind was always lifted up to heavenly things.  Sometimes he forgot to eat; sometimes, when he was dressing, he left off, being carried away in his thought to heaven, with his eyes open, yet abstracted from all things around him.  It was easier for Philip to think upon God, than for men of the world to think of the world.  If anyone entered his room suddenly, he would most probably find him so rapt in prayer, that, when spoken to, he did not give the right answer, and had to take a turn or two up and down the room before he fully came to himself.  If he gave way to his habit of prayer in the most trifling degree, he immediately became lost in contemplation.  It was necessary to distract him lest this continual stretch of mind should be prejudicial to his health.  Before transacting business, however trivial, he always prayed; when asked a question, he never answered till he had recollected himself.  He began praying when he went to bed, and as soon as he awoke, and he did not usually sleep more than four, or at the most five hours.  Sometimes, if anyone showed that he had observed that Philip went to bed late or rose early in order to pray, he would answer, 'Paradise is not made for sluggards.'  He was more than ordinarily intent on prayer at the more solemn feasts, or at a time of urgent spiritual necessities; above all, in Holy Week.  Those who could not make long meditations he advised to lift up their minds repeatedly to God in ejaculatory prayers, as 'Jesus, increase my faith,' 'Jesus, grant that I may never offend Thee.'  Philip introduced family prayer into many of the principal houses of Rome.  When one of his penitents asked him to teach him how to pray, he answered, 'Be humble and obedient, and the Holy Ghost will teach you.'  He had a special devotion for the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity, and daily poured out before Him most fervent prayers for gifts and graces.  Once, when he was passing the night in prayer in the Catacombs, that great miracle took place of the Divine presence of the Holy Ghost descending upon him under the appearance of a ball of fire, entering into his mouth and lodging in his breast, from which time he had a supernatural palpitation of the heart.  He used to say that when our prayers are in the way of being granted, we must not leave off, but pray as fervently as before.   He especially recommended beginners to meditate on the four last things, and used to say that he who does not in his thoughts and fears go down to hell in his lifetime, runs a great risk of going there when he dies.  When he wished to show the necessity of prayer, he said that a man without prayer was an animal without reason.  Many of his disciples improved greatly in this exercisenot religious only, but secular persons, artisans, merchants, physicians, lawyers, and courtiersand became such men of prayer as to receive extraordinary favours from God.  Prayer  Philip, my holy Patron, teach me by thy example, and gain for me by thy intercessions, to seek my Lord and God at all times and in all places, and to live in His presence and in sacred intercourse with Him. As the children of this world look up to rich men or men in station for the favour which they desire, so may I ever lift up my eyes and hands and heart towards heaven, and betake myself to the Source of all good for those goods which I need. As the children of this world converse with their friends and find their pleasure in them, so may I ever hold communion with Saints and Angels, and with the Blessed Virgin, the Mother of my Lord. Pray with me, O Philip, as thou didst pray with thy penitents here below, and then prayer will become sweet to me, as it did to them. "     Meditations and Devotions

       Interesting article  in  urlLink  The  Times (of London) Online    .  I am not a Tridentine Rite partisan, as I have never been to such a Mass, but I find the dismissive attitude of the one priest puzzling. If the interest in this type of liturgy is so very low- 5%, 1%- why not let it be more widely available ? Surely something with such little support will wither away on its own ?  The "young fogeys" statement sounds, IMHO, like the remark of someone who is afraid of competition.....  Of course, if the current English liturgy had better translations, and if certain men celebrating it were less inclined to make it "relaxed, contemporary, a bit jazzy..", competing with the Tridentine folks would be much less of a problem...

        Seven days now....  until St. Philip's Day... Here is  today's meditation and prayer by Venerable Newman... "  May 18 Philip's Devotion    The inward flame of devotion in Philip was so intense that he sometimes fainted in consequence of it, or was forced to throw himself upon his bed, under the sickness of divine love.  When he was young he sometimes felt this divine fervour so vehemently as to be unable to contain himself, throwing himself as if in agony on the ground and crying out, 'No more, Lord, no more.'  What St. Paul says of himself seemed to be fulfilled in Philip: 'I am filled with consolationI over-abound with joy.'  Yet, though he enjoyed sweetnesses, he used to say that he wished to serve God, not out of interestthat is, because there was pleasure in itbut out of pure love, even though he felt no gratification in loving Him.  When he was a layman, he communicated every morning. When he was old, he had frequent ecstacies during his Mass.  Hence it is customary in pictures of Philip to paint him in red vestments, to record his ardent desire to shed his blood for the love of Christ.  He was so devoted to his Lord and Saviour that he was always pronouncing the name of Jesus with unspeakable sweetness. He had also an extraordinary pleasure in saying the Creed, and he was so fond of the 'Our Father' that he lingered on each petition in such a way that it seemed as if he never would get through them.  He had such a devotion to the Blessed Sacrament that, when he was ill, he could not sleep till he had communicated.  When he was reading or meditating on the Passion he was seen to turn as pale as ashes, and his eyes filled with tears.  Once when he was ill, they brought him something to drink. He took the glass in his hand, and when he was putting it to his mouth stopped, and began to weep most bitterly. He cried out, 'Thou, my Christ, Thou upon the Cross wast thirsty, and they gave Thee nothing but gall and vinegar to drink; and I am in bed, with so many comforts around me, and so many persons to attend to me.'  Yet Philip did not make much account of this warmth and acuteness of feeling; for he said that Emotion was not Devotion, that tears were no sign that a man was in the grace of God, neither must we suppose a man holy merely because he weeps when he speaks of religion.  Philip was so devoted to the Blessed Virgin that he had her name continually in his mouth. He had two ejaculations in her honour. One, 'Virgin Mary, Mother of God, pray to Jesus for me.' The other, simply 'Virgin Mother,' for he said that in those two words all possible praises of Mary are contained.  He had also a singular devotion to St. Mary Magdalen, on whose vigil he was born, and for the Apostles St. James and St. Philip; also for St. Paul the Apostle, and for St. Thomas of Aquinum, Doctor of the Church.  Prayer  Philip, my glorious Patron, gain for me a portion of that gift which thou hadst so abundantly. Alas! thy heart was burning with love; mine is all frozen towards God, and alive only for creatures. I love the world, which can never make me happy; my highest desire is to be well off here below. O my God, when shall I learn to love nothing else but Thee? Gain for me, O Philip, a pure love, a strong love, and an efficacious love, that, loving God here upon earth, I may enjoy the sight of Him, together with thee and all saints, hereafter in heaven.

        Interesting paragraph...  from "A Popular History of the Catholic Church" by Philip Hughes ( 1947)  " A more hidden force than this militant company (ed. the Jesuits), and one just as vital to the ultimate success of Trent and all that Trent stood for, was the influence of the Florentine priest St. Philip Neri (1515-1595), who for forty years, from his obscure room in Rome, directed the salvation of the great world of the Curia. To his work, the personal direction of innumerable souls, as much as to the violence of Paul IV, is due the final banishment of sinful life from those high places. The terrible pope cast out devils, and in the clearance St. Philip Neri worked, simply, unostentatiously, jestingly almost, building a new type of spiritually minded clerical official, a new race, whence were to come nuncios, cardinals, legates and popes. In the work of the Roman Oratory, which St. Philip founded, the best of the old humanist tradition was preserved, and a refuge provided for such religious spirits as the forbidding Theatines failed to attract, or the barrack square efficiency of the great Spanish company.

"My God, I adore Thee, as the Third Person of the Ever-Blessed Trinity, under the name and designation of Love. Thou art that Living Love, wherewith the Father and the Son love each other. And Thou art the Author of supernatural love in our hearts'Fons vivus, ignis, charitas.'  As a fire Thou didst come down from heaven on the day of Pentecost; and as a fire Thou burnest away the dross of sin and vanity in the heart and dost light up the pure flame of devotion and affection. It is Thou who unitest heaven and earth by showing to us the glory and beauty of the Divine Nature, and making us love what is in Itself so winning and transporting. I adore Thee, O uncreate and everlasting Fire, by which our souls live, by which alone they are made fit for heaven. " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Meditations and Devotions

        The Feast of St. Jeanne Darc  is today. There is information on her  urlLink  here.  I would also recommend checking out the  urlLink  St. Joan of Arc Center.   One of the best books on her I've come across is  urlLink  Joan of Arc: Her Story   . I am rather fond of  urlLink  this picture of St. Jeanne  .    St. Jeanne is my confirmation name patroness. I came as her to my very first All Saints Day Party, and I still have my "sword of St. Catherine" in the closet. ( I bought a plastic sword, and scratched five crosses into the blade.)   A few quotes, courtesy of the St. Joan of Arc Center.... Asked by the priests at Poitiers, who questioned her before she was permitted to set out, why God needed soldiers: "In the name of God! The soldiers will fight and God will give the victory!"   "In the name of God! I have not come to Poitiers to give signs but take me to Orleans and I shall show you signs for which I have been sent!"   Asked what language her Voices spoke: "They speak better French than you!" (This one has always made me chuckle, as I picture the look on the priest's face ! )   Joan's refusal to use a charm to heal her wound: "No friend, I cannot. I would rather die than do a thing which I know to be a sin."   Joan's request for surrender to the English commander Glasdale: "Classidas! Classidas! Yield, yield to the King of Heaven! You called me harlot, but I have great pity on your soul and for the souls of your men."   Asked at her trial if she was in God's grace: "If I am not, may God put me there, and if I am, may God so keep me! I should be the saddest creature in the world if I knew I was not in His grace."   And her final words... "My Voices did come from God and everything that I have done was by God's order."   "Hold the crucifix up before my eyes so I may see it until I die."   "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!"

        Thank you, Mr. Serafin..  for reminding us that it's  urlLink  Gilbert Keith Chesterton's birthday.    Great set of G.K.C. links  urlLink  here   A few quotes....  " If a man cannot make a fool of himself, we may be quite certain that the effort would be superfluous. " "Right is right, even if nobody does it. Wrong is wrong, even if everybody is wrong about it. " "Books without morality in them are books that send one to sleep standing up. " "The object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid." "You cannot make a success of anything, even loving, without thinking. " "Art, like morality, consists of drawing the line somewhere. " "Man is an exception, whatever else he is. If he is not the image of God, then he is a disease of the dust. If it is not true that a divine being fell, then we can only say that one of the animals went entirely off its head. " "A new philosophy generally means in practice the praise of some old vice." "We are fighting about God: there can be nothing so important as that. "  and, just for my own satisfaction, this quote... "The Oxford Movement: a bow that broke when it had let loose the flashing arrow that was Newman..."

       The Feast of the Ascension of the Lord   is today. ( I am happy to say that my diocese is one which continues to observe it on the proper day.) There is information on it  urlLink  here .   "  He Ascended  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  1. My Lord, I follow Thee up to heaven; as Thou goest up, my heart and mind go with Thee. Never was triumph like this. Thou didst appear a babe in human flesh at Bethlehem. That flesh, taken from the Blessed Virgin, was not before Thou didst form it into a body; it was a new work of Thy hands. And Thy soul was new altogether, created by Thy Omnipotence, at the moment when Thou didst enter into her sacred breast. That pure soul and body, taken as a garment for Thyself, began on earth, and never had been elsewhere. This is the triumph. Earth rises to heaven. I see Thee going up. I see that Form which hung upon the Cross, those scarred hands and feet, that pierced side; they are mounting up to heaven. And the Angels are full of jubilee; the myriads of blessed spirits, which people the glorious expanse, part like the waters to let Thee pass. And the living pavement of God's palaces is cleft in twain, and the Cherubim with flaming swords, who form the rampart of heaven against fallen man, give way and open out, that Thou mayest enter, and Thy saints after Thee. O memorable day!  2. O memorable day! The Apostles feel it to be so, now that it is come, though they felt so differently before it came. When it was coming they dreaded it. They could not think but it would be a great bereavement; but now, as we read, they returned to Jerusalem  ' with great joy.' O what a time of triumph! They understood it now. They understood how weak it had been in them to grudge their Lord and Master, the glorious Captain of their salvation, the Champion and First fruits of the human family, this crown of His great work. It was the triumph of redeemed man. It is the completion of his redemption. It was the last act, making the whole sure, for now man is actually in heaven. He has entered into possession of his inheritance. The sinful race has now one of its own children there, its own flesh and blood, in the person of the Eternal Son. O what a wonderful marriage between heaven and earth! It began in sorrow; but now the long travail of that mysterious wedding day is over; the marriage feast is begun; marriage and birth have gone together; man is new born when Emmanuel enters heaven.  3. O Emmanuel, O God in our flesh! we too hope, by Thy grace, to follow Thee. We will cling to the skirts of Thy garments, as Thou goest up; for without Thee we cannot ascend. O Emmanuel, what a day of joy when we shall enter heaven! O inexpressible ecstasy, after all trouble! There is none strong but Thou.  Tenuisti manum dexteram meam: et in voluntate tua deduxisti me, et cum gloria suscepisti me. Quid enim mihi est in clo, et a Te quid volui super terram? Defecit caro mea et cor meum; Deus cordis mei, et pars mea Deus in æternum.  'Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by Thy will Thou hast conducted me, and with Thy glory Thou hast received me. For what have I in heaven? And besides Thee what do I desire upon earth? For Thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: Thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.

        From the novel,   Callista- A Tale of the Third Century    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " 'There is but one Lover of souls,' cried Cæcilius, 'and He loves each one of us, as though there were no one else to love. He died for each one of us, as if there were no one else to die for. He died on the shameful cross.   Amor meus crucifixus est  . The love which He inspires lasts, for it is the love of the Unchangeable. It satisfies, for He is inexhaustible. The nearer we draw to Him, the more triumphantly does He enter into us; the longer He dwells in us, the more intimately have we possession of Him. It is an espousal for eternity. This is why it is so easy for us to die for our faith, at which the world marvels.' "

        It was a lovely feast day...  Here's the music list: Processional Hymn: "O God Beyond All Praising" Offertory: "Firmly I Believe and Truly" Communion: "Iste Confessor" - (Sung by a small choir, including yours truly...) Recessional Hymn: "Rejoice, the Lord is King "   The Mass was celebrated at 10 am,  in the Oratory's own chapel...the Fathers thought there would be a smaller congregation this year, since many people are out of town for Memorial Day. It turned out that there were so many people that the Oratory's small chapel was absolutely packed. There were six priests, the Oratorians, plus their friend Fr. Maurer from the Cathedral. Fr. David was the main celebrant, as was only appropriate, since he is the current Provost. However, it was Fr. Joseph who preached- a fine homily on St. Philip as 'man of primitive times'- how our saint lived the life of the Gospels, like the early Christians, in a complex and difficult era, and did it with the spirit of joy so recommended by St. Paul in Philippians 4....  Afterwards, there was a brunch upstairs. Good food, good conversation... and a lot of laughter !  In the early evening, I headed over to a cookout at the house of some friends. Many of the same people who had been at the Oratory in the morning were there. The partying continued up until about 9 pm... it would have gone on longer, but people had to get some sleep before they went back to work today.  All in all, a great day !

       IT"S TOMMOROW !  St. Philip's Day, that is....   Here are the final prayer and meditation by Venerable John Henry Cardinal Newman, C.O. .....  "  May 25 Philip's Miraculous Gifts   Philip's great and solid virtues were crowned and adorned by the divine Majesty with various and extraordinary favours, which he in vain used every artifice, if possible, to hide.  It was the good-pleasure of God to enable him to penetrate His ineffable mysteries and to know His marvellous providences by means of ecstasies, raptures, and visions, which were of frequent occurrence during the whole of his life.  A friend going one morning to confession to him, on opening the door of his room softly, saw the Saint in the act of prayer, raised upon his feet, his eyes looking to heaven, his hands extended. He stood for a while watching him, and then going close to him spoke to himbut the saint did not perceive him at all. This state of abstraction continued about eight minutes longer; then he came to himself.  He had the consolation of seeing in vision the souls of many, especially of his friends and penitents, go to heaven. Indeed, those who were intimate with him held it for certain, that none of his spiritual children died without his being certified of the state of their souls.  Philip, both by his sanctity and experience, was able to discriminate between true and false visions. He was earnest in warning men against being deluded, which is very easy and probable.  Philip was especially eminent, even among saints, for his gifts of foretelling the future and reading the heart. The examples of these gifts which might be produced would fill volumes. He foretold the deaths of some; he foretold the recovery of others; he foretold the future course of others; he foretold the births of children to those who were childless; he foretold who would be the Popes before their election; he had the gift of seeing things at a distance; and he knew what was going on in the minds of his penitents and others around him.  He knew whether his penitents had said their prayers, and for how long they were praying. Many of them when talking together, if led into any conversation which was dangerous or wrong, would say: 'We must stop, for St. Philip will find it out.'  Once a woman came to him to confession, when in reality she wished to get an alms. He said to her: 'In God's name, good woman, go away; there is no bread for you'and nothing could induce him to hear her confession.  A man who went to confess to him did not speak, but began to tremble, and when asked, said, 'I am ashamed,'for he had committed a most grievous sin. Philip said gently: 'Do not be afraid; I will tell you what it was'and, to the penitent's great astonishment, he told him.   Such instances are innumerable. There was not one person intimate with Philip who did not affirm that he knew the secrets of the heart most marvellously.  He was almost equally marvellous in his power of healing and restoring to health. He relieved pain by the touch of his hand and the sign of the Cross. And in the same way he cured diseases instantaneouslyat other times by his prayersat other times he commanded the diseases to depart.  This gift was so well known that sick persons got possession of his clothes, his shoes, the cuttings of his hair, and God wrought cures by means of them.  Prayer  Philip , my holy Patron, the wounds and diseases of my soul are greater than bodily ones, and are beyond thy curing, even with thy supernatural power. I know that my Almighty Lord reserves in His own hands the recovery of the soul from death, and the healing of all its maladies. But thou canst do more for our souls by thy prayers now, my dear Saint, than thou didst for the bodies of those who applied to thee when thou wast upon earth. Pray for me, that the Divine Physician of the soul, Who alone reads my heart thoroughly, may cleanse it thoroughly, and that I and all who are dear to me may be cleansed from all our sins; and, since we must die, one and all, that we may die, as thou didst, in the grace and love of God, and with the assurance, like thee, of eternal life.

When I was young, Thou didst put into my heart a special devotion to Thee. Thou hast taken me up in my youth, and in my age Thou wilt not forsake me. Not for my merit, but from Thy free and bountiful love Thou didst put good resolutions into me when I was young, and didst turn me to Thee. Thou wilt never forsake me. I do earnestly trust sonever certainly without fearful provocation on my part. Yet I trust and pray, that Thou wilt keep me from that provocation. O keep me from the provocation of lukewarmness and sloth. O my dear Lord, lead me forward from strength to strength, gently, sweetly, tenderly, lovingly, powerfully, effectually, remembering my fretfulness and feebleness, till Thou bringest me into Thy heaven."- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

        Eighth Day  of the Novena to the Holy Spirit. The link to the prayers posted by Gerard Serafin is  urlLink  here.    " I adore Thee, O dread Lord, for what Thou hast done for my soul. I acknowledge and feel, not only as a matter of faith but of experience, that I cannot have one good thought or do one good act without Thee. I know, that if I attempt anything good in my own strength, I shall to a certainty fail. I have bitter experience of this. My God, I am only safe when Thou dost breathe upon me. If Thou withdraw Thy breath, forthwith my three mortal enemies rush on me and overcome me. I am as weak as water, I am utterly impotent without Thee. The minute Thou dost cease to act in me, I begin to languish, to gasp, and to faint away. Of my good desires, whatever they may be, of my good aims, aspirations, attempts, successes, habits, practices, Thou art the sole cause and present continual source. I have nothing but what I have received, and I protest now in Thy presence, O Sovereign Paraclete, that I have nothing to glory in, and everything to be humbled at." - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

        For Thursday  "In Thee, O Lord, all things live, and Thou dost give them their food.  Oculi omnium in Te sperant "the eyes of all hope in Thee." To the beasts of the field Thou givest meat and drink. They live on day by day, because Thou dost give them day by day to live. And, if Thou givest not, they feel their misery at once. Nature witnesses to this great truth, for they are visited at once with great agony, and they cry out and wildly wander about, seeking what they need. But, as to us Thy children, Thou feedest us with another food. Thou knowest, O my God, who madest us, that nothing can satisfy us but Thyself, and therefore Thou hast caused Thy own self to be meat and drink to us. O most adorable mystery! O most stupendous of mercies! Thou most Glorious, and Beautiful, and Strong, and Sweet, Thou didst know well that nothing else would support our immortal natures, our frail hearts, but Thyself; and so Thou didst take a human flesh and blood, that they, as being the flesh and blood of God, might be our life.

        Seventh Day  of the Novena to the Holy Spirit. Link to prayers on Mr. Serafin's site  urlLink  here.    " I adore Thee, O Almighty Lord, the Paraclete, because Thou in Thy infinite compassion hast brought me into this Church, the work of Thy supernatural power. I had no claim on Thee for so wonderful a favour over anyone else in the whole world. There were many men far better than I by nature, gifted with more pleasing natural gifts, and less stained with sin. Yet Thou, in Thy inscrutable love for me, hast chosen me and brought me into Thy fold. Thou hast a reason for everything Thou dost. I know there must have been an all-wise reason, as we speak in human language, for Thy choosing me and not anotherbut I know that that reason was something external to myself. I did nothing towards itI did everything against it. I did everything to thwart Thy purpose. And thus I owe all to Thy grace. I should have lived and died in darkness and sin; I should have become worse and worse the longer I lived; I should have got more to hate and abjure Thee, O Source of my bliss; I should have got yearly more fit for hell, and at length I should have gone there, but for Thy incomprehensible love to me. O my God, that overpowering love took me captive. Was any boyhood so impious as some years of mine! Did I not in fact dare Thee to do Thy worst? Ah, how I struggled to get free from Thee; but Thou art stronger than I and hast prevailed. I have not a word to say, but to bow down in awe before the depths of Thy love. And then, in course of time, slowly but infallibly did Thy grace bring me on into Thy Church. Now then give me this further grace, Lord, to use all this grace well, and to turn it to my salvation. Teach me, make me, to come to the fountains of mercy continually with an awakened, eager mind, and with lively devotion. Give me a love of Thy Sacraments and Ordinances. Teach me to value as I ought, to prize as the inestimable pearl, that pardon which again and again Thou givest me, and the great and heavenly gift of the Presence of Him whose Spirit Thou art, upon the Altar. Without Thee I can do nothing, and Thou art there where Thy Church is and Thy Sacraments. Give me grace to rest in them for ever, till they are lost in the glory of Thy manifestation in the world to come. " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.     Meditations and Devotions

       Cool news !  I was just checking out the TV schedule over at EWTN, and it turns out that on August 13th, the Very Reverend Paul Chavasse, C.O. , current Provost of the Birmingham Oratory and Postulator General of Oratorian Causes, will be on EWTN Live !  He will be speaking about Venerable John Henry Newman's life, his works, and the current status of his cause. I have heard Fr. Chavasse speak- he is quite good. Of course, this will be excellent publicity, which will, I hope, translate into more prayers for the Venerable's canonization.  (Yes,  I  am   marking my calendar....)

       Sixth Day  of the Novena to the Holy Spirit. The prayers provided by Mr Serafin are  urlLink  here.   "I adore Thee, O my Lord, the Third Person of the All-Blessed Trinity, that Thou hast set up in this world of sin a great light upon a hill. Thou hast founded the Church, Thou hast established and maintained it. Thou fillest it continually with Thy gifts, that men may see, and draw near, and take, and live. Thou hast in this way brought down heaven upon earth. For Thou hast set up a great company which Angels visit by that ladder which the Patriarch saw in vision. Thou hast by Thy Presence restored the communion between God above and man below. Thou hast given him that light of grace which is one with and the commencement of the light of glory. I adore and praise Thee for Thy infinite mercy towards us, O my Lord and God." - Venerable John  Henry Newman, C.O.     Meditations and Devotions

" My God, I adore Thee, O Eternal Paraclete, the light and the life of my soul. Thou mightest have been content with merely giving me good suggestions, inspiring grace and helping from without. Thou mightest thus have led me on, cleansing me with Thy inward virtue, when I changed my state from this world to the next. But in Thine infinite compassion Thou hast from the first entered into my soul, and taken possession of it. Thou hast made it Thy Temple. Thou dwellest in me by Thy grace in an ineffable way, uniting me to Thyself and the whole company of angels and saints. Nay, as some have held, Thou art present in me, not only by Thy grace, but by Thy eternal substance, as if, though I did not lose my own individuality, yet in some sense I was even here absorbed in God. Nayas though Thou hadst taken possession of my very, body, this earthly, fleshly, wretched tabernacleeven my body is Thy Temple. O astonishing, awful truth! I believe it, I know it, O my God!

       Two important things  happened in the Professor's life in the month of June.  First off, in June, 1900, he, along with his mother and his younger brother Hilary, was received into the Catholic Church. He was eight years old.  Second, in June, 1915, he took First Class Honours in Language and Literature at Oxford. This meant the opportunity to have an academic career  was pretty much assured for young Mr. Tolkien- provided, of course, that he survived the First World War....

" My most Holy Lord and Sanctifier, whatever there is of good in me is Thine. Without Thee, I should but get worse and worse as years went on, and should tend to be a devil. If I differ at all from the world, it is because Thou hast chosen me out of the world, and hast lit up the love of God in my heart. If I differ from Thy Saints, it is because I do not ask earnestly enough for Thy grace, and for enough of it, and because I do not diligently improve what Thou hast given me. Increase in me this grace of love, in spite of all my unworthiness. It is more precious than anything else in the world. I accept it in place of all the world can give me. O give it to me! It is my life. " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    Meditations and Devotions

        Third Day  of the Novena to the Holy Spirit. The link to the prayers Mr. Serafin posted is  urlLink  here.   " My God, the Paraclete, I acknowledge Thee as the Giver of that great gift, by which alone we are saved, supernatural love. Man is by nature blind and hardhearted in all spiritual matters; how is he to reach heaven? It is by the flame of Thy grace, which consumes him in order to new-make him, and so to fit him to enjoy what without Thee he would have no taste for. It is Thou, O Almighty Paraclete, who hast been and art the strength, the vigour and endurance, of the martyr in the midst of his torments. Thou art the stay of the confessor in his long, tedious, and humiliating toils. Thou art the fire, by which the preacher wins souls, without thought of himself, in his missionary labours. By Thee we wake up from the death of sin, to exchange the idolatry of the creature for the pure love of the Creator. By Thee we make acts of faith, hope, charity, and contrition. By Thee we live in the atmosphere of earth, proof against its infection. By Thee we are able to consecrate ourselves to the sacred ministry, and fulfil our awful engagements to it. By the fire which Thou didst kindle within us, we pray, and meditate, and do penance. As well could our bodies live, if the sun were extinguished, as our souls, if Thou art away.

       From "The Glories of Mary For the Sake of Her Son",   Discourses to Mixed Congregations   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Now, if you would witness against these unchristian opinions, if you would bring out distinctly and beyond mistake and evasion, the simple idea of the Catholic Church that God is man, could you do it better than by laying down in St. John's words that 'God  became   man'? and again could you express this more emphatically and unequivocally than by declaring that He was  born   a man, or that He had a  Mother ? The world allows that God is man; the admission costs it little, for God is everywhere, and (as it may say) is everything; but it shrinks from confessing that God is the Son of Mary. It shrinks, for it is at once confronted with a severe fact, which violates and shatters its own unbelieving view of things; the revealed doctrine forthwith takes its true shape, and receives an historical reality; and the Almighty is introduced into His own world at a certain time and in a definite way. Dreams are broken and shadows depart; the Divine truth is no longer a poetical expression, or a devotional exaggeration, or a mystical economy, or a mythical representation. 'Sacrifice and offering,' the shadows of the Law, 'Thou wouldest not, but a body hast Thou fitted to me.' 'That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have diligently looked upon, and our hands have handled,' 'That which we have seen and have heard, declare we unto you';such is the record of the Apostle, in opposition to those 'spirits' which denied that 'Jesus Christ had appeared in the flesh,' and which 'dissolved' Him by denying either His human nature or His divine. And the confession that Mary is  Deipara , or the Mother of God, is that safeguard wherewith we seal up and secure the doctrine of the Apostle from all evasion, and that test whereby we detect all the pretences of those bad spirits of 'Antichrist which have gone out into the world'. It declares that He is God; it implies that He is man; it suggests to us that He is God still, though He has become man, and that He is true man though He is God. By witnessing to the  process  of the union, it secures the reality of the two  subjects  of the union, of the divinity and of the manhood. If Mary is the Mother of God, Christ must be literally Emmanuel, God with us. And hence it was, that, when time went on, and the bad spirits and false prophets grew stronger and bolder, and found a way into the Catholic body itself, then the Church, guided by God, could find no more effectual and sure way of expelling them than that of using this word  Deipara  against them; and, on the other hand, when they came up again from the realms of darkness, and plotted the utter overthrow of Christian faith in the sixteenth century, then they could find no more certain expedient for their hateful purpose than that of reviling and blaspheming the prerogatives of Mary, for they knew full well that, if they could once get the world to dishonour the Mother, the dishonour of the Son would follow close. The Church and Satan agreed together in this, that Son and Mother went together...."

        A judicial nominee  who apparently  urlLink  tells it like it is.    My favorite part of the article is this.... "Pryor has said some very blunt things in the past. For example, he's a vigorous opponent of abortion and has called the Roe v. Wade decision 'the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.'   The quote appears in every anti-Pryor tract produced by the liberal interest groups that oppose his nomination. Before the hearing, Pryor no doubt knew that more than one senator would read his words to him and ask for an explanation. And indeed, right off the bat, New York Democrat Charles Schumer recited the 'abomination' line and asked, 'Do you believe that now?'  It was the perfect moment for Pryor to begin a backpedaling, thank-you-for-your-question-and-please-confirm-me explanation. Instead, Pryor said, simply, 'I do.' Schumer looked slightly amazed. 'I appreciate your candor,' he said. 'I really do.' Later, Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter went over the same ground. Did Pryor really say such a thing? Specter asked. Was the quote accurate? Yes, Pryor said, the quote was accurate. Did Pryor stand by his words?  'I stand by that comment,' Pryor said. 'I believe that not only is [Roe] unsupported by the text and structure of the Constitution, but it has led to a morally wrong result. It has led to the slaughter of millions of innocent unborn children.' Specter seemed more than a little chagrined. 'Well,' he said, pausing for a moment and looking down, 'let's move on.' "   I think prayers for this gentleman would be in order- we need him on the bench ASAP !

        From "Waiting for Christ",   Sermons Preached On Various Occasions   by Venerable John Henry Newman. C.O.   " This energetic, direct apprehension of an unseen Lord and Saviour has not been peculiar to Prophets and Apostles; it has been the habit of His Holy Church, and of her children, down to this day. Age passes after age, and she varies her discipline, and she adds to her devotions, and all with the one purpose of fixing her own and their gaze more fully upon the person of her unseen Lord. She has adoringly surveyed Him, feature by feature, and has paid a separate homage to Him in every one. She has made us honour His Five Wounds, His Precious Blood, and His Sacred Heart. She has bid us meditate on His infancy, and the Acts of His ministry; His agony, His scourging, and His crucifixion. She has sent us on pilgrimage to His birthplace and His sepulchre, and the mount of His ascension. She has sought out, and placed before us, the memorials of His life and death; His crib and holy house, His holy tunic, the handkerchief of St. Veronica, the cross and its nails, His winding sheet, and the napkin for His head.  And so, again, if the Church has exalted Mary or Joseph, it has been with a view to the glory of His sacred humanity. If Mary is proclaimed as immaculate, it illustrates the doctrine of her Maternity. If she is called the Mother of God, it is to remind us that, though He is out of sight, He, nevertheless, is our possession, for He is of the race of man. If she is painted with Him in her arms, it is because we will not suffer the Object of our love to cease to be human, because He is also divine. If she is the Mater Dolorosa, it is because she stands by His cross. If she is Maria Desolata, it is because His dead body is on her lap. If, again, she is the Coronata, the crown is set upon her head by His dear hand. And, in like manner, if we are devout to Joseph, it is as to His foster-father; and if he is the saint of happy death, it is because he dies in the hands of Jesus and Mary. "

        Found a wonderful article   over at  urlLink  Christendom Awake  on a topic I  urlLink  blogged about earlier.     urlLink  Created in Whose Image? Menstrual Suppression as a Dualistic Approach to the Female Body-Person   by Katherine H. Bergman.  Here's  a quote...    A reflection on the marketing techniques for menstrual management discussed above is apropos at this point.  The benefits proposed for the suppression of menstruation included 'no cramping, no tampons, no bloating, no backaches,' not to mention that the elimination of that added nuisance for employers  absenteeism and decreased  on-the-job productivity.  Womans body, as given, is problematic.  Menstruation is a hindrance that prevents woman from functioning without interruption in her productivity.  In order to 'fully participate' in what has become normative for post-industrialized culture, she must make her body like a mans.  The natural rhythms of her body are considered an inconvenience and an obstruction to her full participation in a career, or in any of her other societal roles.  When the practically sterile, menstrually suppressed woman becomes normative, it can no longer be denied that society refuses to accept woman precisely as woman.  It will only accept her insofar as she is willing to modify her person (including her body) to fit with societal expectations.

        From "Discourses to Mixed Congregations"  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "The truth is, that the world, knowing nothing of the blessings of the Catholic faith, and prophesying nothing but ill concerning it, fancies that a convert, after the first fervour is over, feels nothing but disappointment, weariness, and offence in his new religion, and is secretly desirous of retracing his steps. This is at the root of the alarm and irritation which it manifests at hearing that doubts are incompatible with a Catholic's profession, because it is sure that doubts will come upon him, and then how pitiable will be his state! That there can be peace, and joy, and knowledge, and freedom, and spiritual strength in the Church, is a thought far beyond the world's imagination; for it regards her simply as a frightful conspiracy against the happiness of man, seducing her victims by specious professions, and, when they are once hers, caring nothing for the misery which breaks upon them, so that by any means she may detain them in bondage. Accordingly, it conceives we are in perpetual warfare with our own reason, fierce objections ever rising within us, and we forcibly repressing them. It believes that, after the likeness of a vessel which has met with some accident at sea, we are ever baling out the water which rushes in upon us, and have hard work to keep afloat; we just manage to linger on, either by an unnatural strain on our minds, or by turning them away from the subject of religion. The world disbelieves our doctrines itself, and cannot understand our own believing them. It considers them so strange, that it is quite sure, though we will not confess it, that we are haunted day and night with doubts, and tormented with the apprehension of yielding to them. I really do think it is the world's judgment, that one principal part of a confessor's work is the putting down such misgivings in his penitents. It fancies that the reason is ever rebelling, like the flesh; that doubt, like concupiscence, is elicited by every sight and sound, and that temptation insinuates itself in every page of letter-press, and through the very voice of a Protestant polemic. When it sees a Catholic Priest, it looks hard at him, to make out how much there is of folly in his composition, and how much of hypocrisy. "

        I really should mention ...  the group blog entitled  urlLink  The Thinklings  . While it seems that the blog contributors are Protestant Christians of  "Evangelical"-type, they have been quite kind to me, posting  three quotes I sent to them, and linking to this blog. The quotes were from the Professor, the Venerable, and Msgr. Ronald Knox. While I obviously disagree with their theologies, the blog is interesting.

While I am not much of an architecture buff, I mention him because we share something else : he was a member of the Secular Oratory in Barcelona- a fact which, for some reason, is not mentioned in the English-language articles on his cause which I have come across.

        The Feast of Pentecost   is today. There is information on it  urlLink  here.   (Note: This article was written in the early 20th century and some of it may be dated. )   "And that noiseless, unostentatious conquest of the earth, made by the Holy Apostles of Christ, became, as regards the Jews, still more secret, from the circumstance that they believed it would be with outward show, though He assured them of the contrary. The Pharisees looked out for some sign from heaven. They would not believe that His kingdom could come, unless they saw it come; they looked out for a prince with troops in battle array; and since He came with twelve poor men and no visible pomp, He was to them as a 'thief in the night,' because of their incredulity, and He was come and in possession before they would allow that He was coming.  But the coming of His kingdom would anyhow have been secret, even though they had not been resolved that it should not be so. And He tells us in the text the reason why. 'Neither shall they say, Behold here, or behold there. For lo, the kingdom of God is within you.' You see, He tells us why He came so covertly. It could not be otherwise, because it was a conquest, not of the body, but of the heart. It was not an assault from without, but it was an inward influence not subduing the outward man through the senses, but, in the words of the Apostle, 'bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ.' Kingdoms of this world spread in space and time; they begin from a point, and they travel onwards, and range round. Their course may be traced: first they secure this territory, then they compass that. They make their ground good, as they go, and consolidate their power. Of course, the kingdom of Christ also, as being in this world, has an outward shape, and fortunes, and a history, like institutions of this world, though it be not of this world. It began from Jerusalem, and went forward to Scythia and to Africa, to India and to Britain; and it has ranks and officers and laws; it observes a strict discipline, and exacts an implicit obedience: but still this is not the full account, or the true process, of its rise and establishment. 'The weapons of its warfare were not carnal;' it came by an inward and intimate visitation; by outward instruments, indeed, but with effects far higher than those instruments; with preaching and argument and discussion, but really by God's own agency. He who is Omnipotent and Omniscient, touched many hearts at once and in many places. They forthwith, one and all, spoke one language, not learning it one from the other so much as taught by Himself the canticle of the Lamb: or, if by men's teaching too, yet catching and mastering it spontaneously, almost before the words were spoken. For time and space, cause and effect, are the servants of His will.  And so, voices broke out all at once into His praise, in the East and in the West, in the North and in the South: and the perplexed world searched about in vain, whence came that concord of sweet and holy sounds. Upon the first word of the preacher, upon a hint, upon a mere whisper in the air, a deep response came from many lips,a deep, full, and ready harmony of many voices one and all proclaiming the Saviour of men. For the Spirit of the Lord had descended and filled the earth; and there were thrilling hearts, and tremulous pulses, and eager eyes, in every place. It was a time of visitation when the weak were to become strong, and the last become first. It was the triumph of faith, which delays not, but accepts generously and promptly,according to the Scripture, 'The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart; this is the word of faith which we preach.' And thus, as Nineveh and Babylon were surprised of old by the army of the enemy, so was the world thus surprised by Him, who, in prophetic language, rode upon a white horse and was called 'Faithful and True'; and, as it befell Egypt at the first Pasch, that there was not a house where there lay not one dead, so now, on this more gracious Passage there was not a house where there was not one alive. For the Highest had come down among them, and was everywhere; the Lord of Angels was walking the earth; He was scattering His gifts freely, and multiplying His Image: and, in this sense, as well as in that in which He spoke the words, 'a man's enemies were they of his own household.' The despised, the hated influence insinuated itself everywhere; the leaven spread, and none could stay it; and in the most unlikely places, in the family of the haughty and fierce soldier, amid the superstitions of idolatry and the degradations of slavery, the noblest, and the ablest, and the fairest, as well as the brutish and the ignorant, one and all, by a secret power, became the prey of the Church and the bondsmen of Christ. And thus a great and wide-spreading kingdom flushed into existence all at once, like spring after winter, from within.

       From  The Present Position of Catholics in England   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "All the world knows that Catholics hold that the Apostles made over the Divine Revelation to the generation after them, not only in writing, but by word of mouth, and in the ritual of the Church. We consider that the New Testament is not the whole of what they left us; that they left us a number of doctrines, not in writing at all, but living in the minds and mouths of the faithful; Protestants deny this. They have a right to deny it; but they have no right to assume their denial to be true without proof, and to use it as self-evident, and to triumph over us as beaten, merely because we will not admit it. Yet this they actually do; can anything be more preposterous? however, they do this as innocently and naturally as if it were the most logical of processes, and the fairest and most unexceptionable of proceedings. For instance there was a country gentleman in this neighbourhood in the course of last year, who, having made some essays in theology among his tenantry in his walks over his estate, challenged me to prove some point, I am not clear what, but I think it was the infallibility of the Holy See, or of the Church. Were my time my own, I should never shrink from any controversy, having the experience of twenty years, that the more Catholicism and its doctrines are sifted, the more distinct and luminous will its truth ever come out into view; and in the instance in question I did not decline the invitation. However, it soon turned out that it was a new idea to the gentleman in question, that I was not bound to prove the point in debate simply by Scripture; he considered that Scripture was to be the sole basis of the discussion. This was quite another thing. For myself, I firmly believe that in Scripture the Catholic doctrine on the subject is contained; but had I accepted this gratuitous and officious proposition, you see I should have been simply recognising a Protestant principle, which I disown. He would not controvert with me at all, unless I subscribed to a doctrine which I believe to be, not only a dangerous, but an absurd error; and, because I would not allow him to assume what it was his business to prove, before he brought it forward, and because I challenged him to prove that Scripture was, as he assumed, the Rule of Faith, he turned away as happy and self-satisfied as if he had gained a victory. That all truth is contained in Scripture was his first principle; he thought none but an idiot could doubt it; none but a Jesuit could deny it; he thought it axiomatic; he thought that to offer proof was even a profanation of so self-evident a point, and that to demand it was a  reductio ad absurdum   of the person demanding;but this, I repeat, was no extraordinary instance of Protestant argumentation; it occurs every other day."

        From "Neglect of Divine Calls and Warnings",  Discourses to Mixed Congregations   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "No one sins without making some excuse to himself for sinning. He is obliged to do so: man is not like the brute beasts; he has a divine gift within him which we call reason, and which constrains him to account before its judgment-seat for what he does. He cannot act at random; however he acts, he must act by some kind of rule, on some sort of principle; else he is vexed and dissatisfied with himself. Not that he is very particular whether he finds a good reason or a bad, when he is very much straitened for a reason; but a reason of some sort he must have. Hence you sometimes find those who give up religious duty altogether, attacking the conduct of religious men, whether their acquaintance, or the ministers or professors of religion, as a sort of excusea very bad onefor their neglect. Others will make the excuse that they are so far from church, or so closely occupied at home, whether they will or not, that they cannot serve God as they ought. Others say that it is no use trying to do so, that they have again and again gone to confession and tried to keep out of mortal sin, and cannot; and so they give up the attempt as hopeless. Others, when they fall into sin, excuse themselves on the plea that they are but following nature; that the impulses of nature are so very strong, and that it cannot be wrong to follow that nature which God has given us. Others are bolder still, and they cast off religion altogether: they deny its truth; they deny Church, Gospel, and Bible; they go so far perhaps as even to deny God's governance of His creatures. They boldly deny that there is any life after death: and, this being the case, of course they would be fools indeed not to take their pleasure here, and to make as much of this poor life as they can."  BTW, this passage was written in  1849   !

        For Thursday..  My favorite Eucharistic hymn..(actually, my favorite hymn, period...)   Let all mortal flesh keep silence, And with fear and trembling stand; Ponder nothing earthly minded, For with blessing in His hand, Christ our God to earth descendeth, Our full homage to demand.  King of kings, yet born of Mary, As of old on earth He stood, Lord of lords, in human vesture, In the Body and the Blood; He will give to all the faithful His own Self for heavenly food.  Rank on rank the host of heaven Spreads its vanguard on the way, As the Light of light descendeth From the realms of endless day, That the powers of hell may vanish As the darkness clears away.  At His feet the six wingèd seraph, Cherubim with sleepless eye, Veil their faces to the Presence, As with ceaseless voice they cry: Alleluia, Alleluia Alleluia, Lord Most High!

        A warning note....  from   The Idea of a University  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " Truth has two attributesbeauty and power; and while Useful Knowledge is the possession of truth as powerful, Liberal Knowledge is the apprehension of it as beautiful. Pursue it, either as beauty or as power, to its furthest extent and its true limit, and you are led by either road to the Eternal and Infinite, to the intimations of conscience and the announcements of the Church. Satisfy yourself with what is only visibly or intelligibly excellent, as you are likely to do, and you will make present utility and natural beauty the practical test of truth, and the sufficient object of the intellect. It is not that you will at once reject Catholicism, but you will measure and proportion it by an earthly standard. You will throw its highest and most momentous disclosures into the background, you will deny its principles, explain away its doctrines, re-arrange its precepts, and make light of its practices, even while you profess it. Knowledge, viewed as Knowledge, exerts a subtle influence in throwing us back on ourselves, and making us our own centre, and our minds the measure of all things. "

        From the homily  Fr. Michael was the celebrant. In his homily on he brought up a classic quote dating from the 1600's- the comment of a representative of the Holy See who was sent to Port Royal, France,  to try to deal with the community of nuns there, which had become a hotbed of the heresy of Jansenism. The mission did not go well, and the prelate was left to comment on these nuns, "They are as pure as angels- and as proud as demons !"

       On this date, 170 years ago....  Venerable John Henry Newman wrote what is probably the most famous of his verses, while on a boat returning to England...   The Pillar of the Cloud    Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom            Lead Thou me on!  The night is dark, and I am far from home            Lead Thou me on!  Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see  The distant sceneone step enough for me.    I was not ever thus, nor pray'd that Thou            Shouldst lead me on.  I loved to choose and see my path, but now            Lead Thou me on!  I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,  Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.    So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still            Will lead me on,  O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till            The night is gone;  And with the morn those angel faces smile  Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.     At Sea. June 16, 1833.

        Today is Trinity Sunday    Essenen Atarwa, ar Yondova, ar Ainasúleva. Amen.   - The Sign of the Cross... in Quenya....( I sometimes pray it that way, privately- it helps me keep from merely rattling it off and makes me  think   about the words....)   "The Trinity is our Maker. The Trinity is our Keeper. The Trinity is our Everlasting Lover. The Trinity is our Endless Joy." - Blessed Julian of Norwich   "What mind of man can imagine the love which the Eternal Father bears towards the Only Begotten Son? It has been from everlasting,and it is infinite; so great is it that divines call the Holy Ghost by the name of that love, as if to express its infinitude and perfection. Yet reflect, O my soul, and bow down before the awful mystery, that, as the Father loves the Son, so doth the Son love thee, if thou art one of His elect; for He says expressly, 'As the Father hath loved Me, I also have loved you. Abide in My love.' What mystery in the whole circle of revealed truths is greater than this?  The love which the Son bears to thee, a creature, is like that which the Father bears to the uncreated Son. O wonderful mystery!  This , then, is the history of what else is so strange: that He should have taken my flesh and died for me. The former mystery anticipates the latter; that latter does but fulfil the former. Did He not love me so inexpressibly, He would not have suffered for me. I understand now why He died for me, because He loved me as a father loves his sonnot as a human father merely, but as the Eternal Father the Eternal Son. I see now the meaning of that else inexplicable humiliation: He preferred to regain me rather than to create new worlds.  How constant is He in His affection! He has loved us from the time of Adam. He has said from the beginning, 'I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.' He did not forsake us in our sin. He did not forsake me. He found me out and regained me. He made a point of itHe resolved to restore me, in spite of myself, to that blessedness which I was so obstinately set against. And now what does He ask of me, but that, as He has loved me with an everlasting love, so I should love Him in such poor measures as I can show.  O mystery of mysteries, that the ineffable love of Father to Son should be the love of the Son to us! Why was it, O Lord? What good thing didst Thou see in me a sinner? Why wast Thou set on me? 'What is man, that Thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that Thou visitest him?' This poor flesh of mine, this weak sinful soul, which has no life except in Thy grace, Thou didst set Thy love upon it. Complete Thy work, O Lord, and as Thou hast loved me from the beginning, so make me to love Thee unto the end. " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. , "Hope in God-Creator",  Meditations and Devotions   "If there is one question which the enlightened and liberal have the habit of deriding and holding up as a dreadful example of barren dogma and senseless sectarian strife, it is this Athanasian question of the Co-Eternity of the Divine Son. On the other hand, if there is one thing that the same liberals always offer us as a piece of pure and simple Christianity, untroubled by doctrinal disputes, it is the single sentence, 'God is Love.' Yet the two statements are almost identical; at least one is very nearly nonsense without the other. The barren dogma is only the logical way of stating the beautiful sentiment. For if there be a being without beginning, existing before all things, was He loving when there was nothing to be loved? If through that unthinkable eternity He is lonely, what is the meaning of saying He is love? The only justification of such a mystery is the mystical conception that in His own nature there was something analogous to self-expression; something of what begets and beholds what it has begotten. Without some such idea, it is really illogical to complicate the ultimate essence of deity with an idea like love. If the moderns really want a simple religion of love, they must look for it in the Athanasian Creed. The truth is that the trumpet of true Christianity, the challenge of the charities and simplicities of Bethlehem or Christmas Day never rang out more arrestingly and unmistakably than in the defiance of Athanasius to the cold compromise of the Arians. It was emphatically he who really was fighting for a God of Love against a God of colourless and remote cosmic control; the God of the stoics and the agnostics. It was emphatically he who was fighting for the Holy Child against the grey deity of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. He was fighting for that very balance of beautiful interdependence and intimacy, in the very Trinity of the Divine Nature, that draws our hearts to the Trinity of the Holy Family. His dogma, if the phrase be not misunderstood, turns even God into a Holy Family. " - G.K. Chesterton,  The Everlasting Man

        Interesting...  I found a  urlLink  blogger  who liked some of my favorite books as a child- "The Girl with the Silver Eyes", "A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver" , books by E.L. Konigsburg and Edward Eager,and  Joan Aiken's Arabel and Mortimer tales. (I also liked some of Aiken's other work, particularly the short story "Smoke from Cromwell's Time" and the Armitage family stories- how can a kid not love a family which handles raising a baby gryphon so very matter of factly ?) I shared her fondness for the Bagthorpe clan as well- I've sometimes wished for Grandfather Bagthorpe's ability to be 'selecitively deaf' !  Then I came across a little blog  urlLink review   of one of the odder books I've read recently- "The Eyre Affair".  Some of the language in the novel is needlessly coarse, but it is certainly a very fun read. ( Personal favorite scenes- the production of "Richard III", the kids trading Henry Fielding character cards, and the scene in which the heroine repairs a hole in the spacetime continuum- with a basketball . Really !  )   I think I'll have to keep a closer eye on these  urlLink two   urlLink  bloggers.

        The Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus   is today. There are interesting posts about this feast  urlLink here ,  urlLink  here ,  urlLink here,    urlLink  here , and  urlLink here.  (Sorry about any I have missed..)   The Sacred Heart by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " 1. O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I adore Thee in the oneness of the Personality of the Second Person of the Holy Trinity. Whatever belongs to the Person of Jesus, belongs therefore to God, and is to be worshipped with that one and the same worship which we pay to Jesus. He did not take on Him His human nature, as something distinct and separate from Himself, but as simply, absolutely, eternally His, so as to be included by us in the very thought of Him. I worship Thee, O Heart of Jesus, as being Jesus Himself, as being that Eternal Word in human nature which He took wholly and lives in wholly, and therefore in Thee. Thou art the Heart of the Most High made man. In worshipping Thee, I worship my Incarnate God, Emmanuel. I worship Thee, as bearing a part in that Passion which is my life, for Thou didst burst and break, through agony, in the garden of Gethsemani, and Thy precious contents trickled out, through the veins and pores of the skin, upon the earth. And again, Thou hadst been drained all but dry upon the Cross; and then, after death, Thou wast pierced by the lance, and gavest out the small remains of that inestimable treasure, which is our redemption.  2. My God, my Saviour, I adore Thy Sacred Heart, for that heart is the seat and source of all Thy tenderest human affections for us sinners. It is the instrument and organ of Thy love. It did beat for us. It yearned over us. It ached for us, and for our salvation. It was on fire through zeal, that the glory of God might be manifested in and by us. It is the channel through which has come to us all Thy overflowing human affection, all Thy Divine Charity towards us. All Thy incomprehensible compassion for us, as God and Man, as our Creator and our Redeemer and Judge, has come to us, and comes, in one inseparably mingled stream, through that Sacred Heart. O most Sacred symbol and Sacrament of Love, divine and human, in its fulness, Thou didst save me by Thy divine strength, and Thy human affection, and then at length by that wonder-working blood, wherewith Thou didst overflow.  3. O most Sacred, most loving Heart of Jesus, Thou art concealed in the Holy Eucharist, and Thou beatest for us still. Now as then Thou savest,  Desiderio desideravi 'With desire I have desired.' I worship Thee then with all my best love and awe, with my fervent affection, with my most subdued, most resolved will. O my God, when Thou dost condescend to suffer me to receive Thee, to eat and drink Thee, and Thou for a while takest up Thy abode within me, O make my heart beat with Thy Heart. Purify it of all that is earthly, all that is proud and sensual, all that is hard and cruel, of all perversity, of all disorder, of all deadness. So fill it with Thee, that neither the events of the day nor the circumstances of the time may have power to ruffle it, but that in Thy love and Thy fear it may have peace.

        Series of good posts   urlLink by   urlLink Chris   urlLink Burgwald   urlLink on    urlLink anti-Catholicism.   The one thing that really leaves me scratching my head: the title of Mr. Swift's blog..."Vessel of Honour " ! Doesn't he realize that title simply reeks of  urlLink "Mariolatry"   ?  I'll be praying the true "Vessel of Honour" brings him to conversion- or at least a bit of sanity- through her powerful intercession.   BTW, my beloved Venerable wrote a classic on the subject of anti-Catholicism-  urlLink  Lectures on the Present Position of Catholics in England  . It is a trifle dated in its examples, but is intensely wise in its principles- as well as being hilariously funny in parts. ( If you read no other section, at least check out this  urlLink  parody  of  the anti-Catholic rallies common in the England of Venerable Newman's day.)

        "The Laughter of the Saints"  by F. Drouet, C.M. can be found  urlLink  here.   It has, of course, several mentions of St. Philip, including this one:  "In this gallery of cheerful Saints, a particularly honorable mention is due to St. Philip Neri, whom Goethe justly calls the 'humoristic Saint.'  He was fond of playing...tricks on his novices, and if he saw one of them a bit proud of his new habit, he would send him out on some errand, with a ridiculous appendage, like, for instance, a fox tail, hanging over his back.  The following anecdote, the authenticity of which is guaranteed by the best authorities, will suffice to illustrate this amusing feature of his character.  One day he was sent by the Pope himself to some neighboring convent to inquire into the life of a nun who had the reputation of a Saint.  The weather was horrible, and when Philip dismounted he was bespattered with mud from head to foot.  The good Sister was brought before him, and judging at a glance that her air of compunction was rather overdone, Philip said abruptly while stretching out his leg:  'Pull off my boots, won't you?'  The would&#8209;be Saint assumed at once an air of offended dignity, and without any further inquiry the Pope's envoy put on his hat, went straight to his master, and told him that a religious so devoid of humility had no claim whatever to the saints' aureole.

       From the sermon "Omnipotence in Bonds"  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " My Brethren, it is plain that, when we confess God as Omnipotent only, we have gained but a half-knowledge of Him: His is an Omnipotence which can at the same time swathe Itself in infirmity and can become the captive of Its own creatures. He has, if I may so speak, the incomprehensible power of even making Himself weak. We must know Him by His names, Emmanuel and Jesus, to know Him perfectly."

       From  Difficulties of Anglicans   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " Such being the extreme difference between the Church and the world, both as to the measure and the scale of moral good and evil, we may be prepared for those vast differences in matters of detail, which I hardly like to mention, lest they should be out of keeping with the gravity of the subject, as contemplated in its broad principle. For instance, the Church pronounces the momentary wish, if conscious and deliberate, that another should be struck down dead, or suffer any other grievous misfortune, as a blacker sin than a passionate, unpremeditated attempt on the life of the Sovereign. She considers direct unequivocal consent, though as quick as thought, to a single unchaste desire as indefinitely more heinous than any lie which can possibly be fancied, that is, when that lie is viewed, of course, in itself, and apart from its causes, motives, and consequences. Take a mere beggar-woman, lazy, ragged, and filthy, and not over-scrupulous of truth(I do not say she had arrived at perfection)but if she is chaste, and sober, and cheerful, and goes to her religious duties (and I am supposing not at all an impossible case), she will, in the eyes of the Church, have a prospect of  heaven, which is quite closed and refused to the State's pattern-man, the just, the upright, the generous, the honourable, the conscientious, if he be all this, not from a supernatural power(I do not determine whether this is likely to be the fact, but I am contrasting views and principles)not from a supernatural power, but from mere natural virtue. Polished, delicate-minded ladies, with little of temptation around them, and no self-denial to practise, in spite of their refinement and taste, if they be nothing more, are objects of less interest to her, than many a poor outcast who sins, repents, and is with difficulty kept just within the territory of grace.

       If it were not Sunday..  today would be the feast of Sts. John Fisher, Bishop, Cardinal, and Martyr, and St. Thomas More, Martyr. There is information on  urlLink  them    urlLink  here.    "Did You find many stones, that is to say, many constant people when You began to build Your Church ? Were not those You set in the foundation soft and unstable earth ? Yes, truly, until the time You made them hard as stones by the virtue and strength of Your burning charity. Did not Peter, the head of all the others, out of fear of one handmaid or woman servant, give place and deny Your Son Jesus Christ his Master ? Was there not also contention and debate among others of the apostles which of them should be chief and have the sovereignty among them ? Furthermore, they all fled for fear when their Master Christ was taken and brought to judgement. See what great pusillanimity, cowardice, and unsteadfastness was in them. But as soon as the heat of Your charity descended on them in the similitude of fire, they were then made so constant and sure in their minds that from that time forward no dread, threatening, or persecution could make them afraid to declare You message and commandment. They pronounced and expressed Your Gospel to kings, princes, and other wise men of this world, overcoming them by the virtue of Your word, and turned innumerable to the Faith and to the acknowledgement of Your Holy Name.  So, good Lord, do now in like manner again with Your Church Militant. Change and make the soft and unstable earth into hard stones. Set in Your Church mighty pillars that can suffer and endure great labours, watching, poverty, thirst, hunger, cold, and heat, and who will not fear the rebukes of princes, persecution, or death but always persuade themselves and think with a good will to suffer slanders, shame, and all kinds of torments for the glory and praise of Your Holy Name. In this manner, Good Lord, the truth of Your Gospel will be preached throughout all the world:  et timebunt gentes nomen tuum, Domine, et omnes reges terre gloriam tuam , by this not not will the ordinary common people fear Your Name but also the kings and princes of this word dread Your magnificence and glory. " - From  Exposition of the Seven Pentitential Psalms , by St. John Fisher (The language has been somewhat updated from that of the original edition published in 1508, for the sake of readability.)

       The Solemnity of the Body and Blood of the Lord, also known as  Corpus Christi   is today- in the United States.   " 1406. Jesus said: 'I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; . . . he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and . . . abides in me, and I in him' (Jn 6:51, 54, 56).   1407. The Eucharist is the heart and the summit of the Church's life, for in it Christ associates his Church and all her members with his sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving offered once for all on the cross to his Father; by this sacrifice he pours out the graces of salvation on his Body which is the Church.   1408. The Eucharistic celebration always includes: the proclamation of the Word of God; thanksgiving to God the Father for all his benefits, above all the gift of his Son; the consecration of bread and wine; and participation in the liturgical banquet by receiving the Lord's Body and Blood. These elements constitute one single act of worship.   1409. The Eucharist is the memorial of Christ's Passover, that is, of the work of salvation accomplished by the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, a work made present by the liturgical action.   1410. It is Christ himself, the eternal high priest of the New Covenant who, acting through the ministry of the priests, offers the Eucharistic sacrifice. And it is the same Christ, really present under the species of bread and wine, who is the offering of the Eucharistic sacrifice.   1411. Only validly ordained priests can preside at the Eucharist and consecrate the bread and the wine so that they become the Body and Blood of the Lord.   1412. The essential signs of the Eucharistic sacrament are wheat bread and grape wine, on which the blessing of the Holy Spirit is invoked and the priest pronounces the words of consecration spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper: ' This is My Body which will be given up for you. . . . This is the cup of My Blood. . . .'   1413. By the consecration the transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ is brought about. Under the consecrated species of bread and wine Christ Himself, living and glorious, is present in a true, real, and substantial manner: His Body and His Blood, with His Soul and His Divinity (cf. Council of Trent: DS 1640; 1651).   1414. As sacrifice, the Eucharist is also offered in reparation for the sins of the living and the dead and to obtain spiritual or temporal benefits from God.   1415. Anyone who desires to receive Christ in Eucharistic communion must be in the state of grace. Anyone aware of having sinned mortally must not receive communion without having received absolution in the sacrament of penance.   1416. Communion with the Body and Blood of Christ increases the communicant's union with the Lord, forgives his venial sins, and preserves him from grave sins. Since receiving this sacrament strengthens the bonds of charity between the communicant and Christ, it also reinforces the unity of the Church as the Mystical Body of Christ.   1417. The Church warmly recommends that the faithful receive Holy Communion when they participate in the celebration of the Eucharist; she obliges them to do so at least once a year.   1418. Because Christ Himself is present in the sacrament of the altar, He is to be honored with the worship of adoration. 'To visit the Blessed Sacrament is . . . a proof of gratitude, an expression of love, and a duty of adoration toward Christ our Lord' (Paul VI, MF 66).   1419. Having passed from this world to the Father, Christ gives us in the Eucharist the pledge of glory with Him. Participation in the Holy Sacrifice identifies us with His Heart, sustains our strength along the pilgrimage of this life, makes us long for eternal life, and unites us even now to the Church in heaven, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the saints. " -  Catechism of the Catholic Church   Here is a  urlLink  link   to an earlier post on St. Philip Neri and the Blessed Sacrament.    Anima Christi  (Translated by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.)   "Soul of Christ, be my sanctification; Body of Christ, be my salvation; Blood of Christ, fill all my veins; Water of Christs side, wash out my stains; Passion of Christ, my comfort be; O good Jesu, listen to me; In thy wounds I fain would hide, Neer to be parted from Thy side; Guard me, should the foe assail me; Call me when my life shall fail me; Bid me come to Thee above, With Thy saints to sing Thy love, World without end.  Amen."   A Short Visit to the Blessed Sacrament before Meditation  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.  I place myself in the presence of Him, in whose Incarnate Presence I am before I place myself there.  I adore Thee, O my Saviour, present here as God and man, in soul and body, in true flesh and blood.  I acknowledge and confess that I kneel before that Sacred Humanity, which was conceived in Mary's womb, and lay in Mary's bosom; which grew up to man's estate, and by the Sea of Galilee called the Twelve, wrought miracles, and spoke words of wisdom and peace; which in due season hung on the cross, lay in the tomb, rose from the dead, and now reigns in heaven.  I praise, and bless, and give myself wholly to Him, who is the true Bread of my soul, and my everlasting joy."    Holy Communion  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "1. My God, who can be inhabited by Thee, except the pure and holy? Sinners may come to Thee, but to whom shouldst Thou come except to the sanctified? My God, I adore Thee as the Holiest; and, when Thou didst come upon earth, Thou didst prepare a holy habitation for Thyself in the most chaste womb of the Blessed Virgin. Thou didst make a dwelling place special for Thyself. She did not receive Thee without first being prepared for Thee; for from the moment that she was at all, she was filled with Thy grace, so that she never knew sin. And so she went on increasing in grace and merit year after year, till the time came, when Thou didst send down the Archangel to signify to her Thy presence within her. So holy must be the dwelling place of the Highest. I adore and glorify Thee, O Lord my God, for Thy great holiness.  2. O my God, holiness becometh Thy House, and yet Thou dost make Thy abode in my breast. My Lord, my Saviour, to me Thou comest, hidden under the semblance of earthly things, yet in that very flesh and blood which Thou didst take from Mary. Thou, who didst first inhabit Mary's breast, dost come to me. My God, Thou seest me; I cannot see myself. Were I ever so good a judge about myself, ever so unbiassed, and with ever so correct a rule of judging, still, from my very nature, I cannot look at myself, and view myself truly and wholly. But Thou, as Thou comest to me, contemplatest me. When I say,  Domine, non sum dignus 'Lord, I am not worthy'Thou whom I am addressing, alone understandest in their fulness the words which I use. Thou seest how unworthy so great a sinner is to receive the One Holy God, whom the Seraphim adore with trembling. Thou seest, not only the stains and scars of past sins, but the mutilations, the deep cavities, the chronic disorders which they have left in my soul. Thou seest the innumerable living sins, though they be not mortal, living in their power and presence, their guilt, and their penalties, which clothe me. Thou seest all my bad habits, all my mean principles, all wayward lawless thoughts, my multitude of infirmities and miseries, yet Thou comest. Thou seest most perfectly how little I really feel what I am now saying, yet Thou comest. O my God, left to myself should I not perish under the awful splendour and the consuming fire of Thy Majesty. Enable me to bear Thee, lest I have to say with Peter, 'Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!'   3. My God, enable me to bear Thee, for Thou alone canst. Cleanse my heart and mind from all that is past. Wipe out clean all my recollections of evil. Rid me from all languor, sickliness, irritability, feebleness of soul. Give me a true perception of things unseen, and make me truly, practically, and in the details of life, prefer Thee to anything on earth, and the future world to the present. Give me courage, a true instinct determining between right and wrong, humility in all things, and a tender longing love of Thee. "   Meditations and Devotions

       For Saturday     Mary is the "Speculum Justitiae," the Mirror of Justice  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Here first we must consider what is meant by  justice , for the word as used by the Church has not that sense which it bears in ordinary English. By 'justice' is not meant the virtue of fairness, equity, uprightness in our dealings; but it is a word denoting all virtues at once, a perfect, virtuous state of soulrighteousness, or moral perfection; so that it answers very nearly to what is meant by  sanctity . Therefore when our Lady is called the 'Mirror of Justice,' it is meant to say that she is the Mirror of sanctity, holiness, supernatural goodness.  Next, what is meant by calling her a  mirror ? A mirror is a surface which reflects, as still water, polished steel, or a looking-glass. What did Mary reflect? She reflected our Lordbut  He  is infinite  Sanctity . She then, as far as a creature could, reflected His Divine sanctity, and therefore she is the  Mirror  of Sanctity, or, as the Litany says, of  Justice .  Do we ask how she came to reflect His Sanctity? it was by living with Him. We see every day how like people get to each other who live with those they love. When they live with those whom they don't love, as, for instance, the members of a family who quarrel with each other, then the longer they live together the more unlike each other they become; but when they love each other, as husband and wife, parents and children, brothers with brothers or sisters, friends with friends, then in course of time they get surprisingly like each other. All of us perceive this; we are witnesses to it with our own eyes and earsin the expression of their features, in their voice, in their walk, in their language, even in their handwriting, they become like each other; and so with regard to their minds, as in their opinions, their tastes, their pursuits. And again doubtless in the state of their souls, which we do not see, whether for good or for bad.  Now, consider that Mary loved her Divine Son with an unutterable love; and consider too she had Him all to herself for thirty years. Do we not see that, as she was full of grace  before  she conceived Him in her womb, she must have had a vast incomprehensible sanctity when she had lived close to God for thirty years?a sanctity of an angelical order, reflecting back the attributes of God with a fulness and exactness of which no saint upon earth, or hermit, or holy virgin, can even remind us. Truly then she is the  Speculum Justitiae , the  Mirror  of Divine  Perfection . "    Meditations and Devotions

It was interesting, but I had a bit of a beef with her Tolkien criticism... and sent the e-mail which I am posting below (with her kind permission...) (WARNING: LORD OF THE RINGS SPOILERS !)    Subject: In defense of Aragorn and LOTR...  Date: Wed, 2 Jul 2003 16:45:17 -0400   " King Elessar Telcontar did not rest on his laurels. He not only rebuilt Minas Tirith, he led the way in the resettlement of the entire North Kingdom (Arnor), established good relations with various formerly hostile neighbors like Harad, and fended off other hostile neighbors when necessary. No, he didn't defeat all evil, but neither can we.... Tolkien was a Catholic- he knew the true defeat of Evil in Middle-earth didn't happen until Calvary....   Besides, the true hero of the book, IMHO, is Samwise Gamgee- who spent his later years making the Shire a better place to live and raising 13 children !  He didn't 'sail off into the sunset' until after the death of his wife.... "

        The Feast of St. Thomas, Apostle  is today. There is information on him  urlLink  here.     " God Alone   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    Thomas says to Him, 'My Lord and my God.'   1. I adore Thee, O my God, with Thomas; and if I have, like him, sinned through unbelief, I adore Thee the more. I adore Thee as the One Adorable, I adore Thee as more glorious in Thy humiliation, when men despised Thee, than when Angels worshipped Thee.  Deus meus et omnia 'My God and my all.' To have Thee is to have everything I can have. O my Eternal Father, give me Thyself. I dared not have made so bold a request, it would have been presumption, unless Thou hadst encouraged me. Thou hast put it into my mouth, Thou hast clothed Thyself in my nature, Thou hast become my Brother, Thou hast died as other men die, only in far greater bitterness, that, instead of my eyeing Thee fearfully from afar, I might confidently draw near to Thee. Thou dost speak to me as Thou didst speak to Thomas, and dost beckon me to take hold of Thee. My God and my all, what could I say more than this, if I spoke to all eternity! I am full and abound and overflow, when I have Thee; but without Thee I am nothingI wither away, I dissolve and perish. My Lord and my God, my God and my all, give me Thyself and nothing else.   2. Thomas came and touched Thy sacred wounds. O will the day ever come when I shall be allowed actually and visibly to kiss them? What a day will that be when I am thoroughly cleansed from all impurity and sin, and am fit to draw near to my Incarnate God in His palace of light above! what a morning, when having done with all penal suffering, I see Thee for the first time with these very eyes of mine, I see Thy countenance, gaze upon Thy eyes and gracious lips without quailing, and then kneel down with joy to kiss Thy feet, and am welcomed into Thy arms. O my only true Lover, the only Lover of my soul, Thee will I love now, that I may love Thee then. What a day, a long day without ending, the day of eternity, when I shall be so unlike what I am now, when I feel in myself a body of death, and am perplexed and distracted with ten thousand thoughts, any one of which would keep me from heaven. O my Lord, what a day when I shall have done once for all with all sins, venial as well as mortal, and shall stand perfect and acceptable in Thy sight, able to bear Thy presence, nothing shrinking from Thy eye, not shrinking from the pure scrutiny of Angels and Archangels, when I stand in the midst and they around me!  3. O my God, though I am not fit to see or touch Thee yet, still I will ever come within Thy reach, and desire that which is not yet given me in its fulness. O my Saviour, Thou shalt be my sole God!I will have no Lord but Thee. I will break to pieces all idols in my heart which rival Thee. I will have nothing but Jesus and Him crucified. It shall be my life to pray to Thee, to offer myself to Thee, to keep Thee before me, to worship Thee in Thy holy Sacrifice, and to surrender myself to Thee in Holy Communion.

       Jesus the Lord of Armies  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Among the visions which the beloved disciple St. John was given to see, and which he has recorded in his Apocalypse, one was that of our Lord as the commander and leader of the hosts of the Saints in their warfare with the world. 'I saw,' he says, 'and behold a white horse, and He that sat on him had a bow, and there was a crown given Him; and He went forth conquering that He might conquer' (Apoc. vi. 2). And again, 'I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and with justice doth He judge and fight' (Apoc. xix. 11)  'And he was clothed with a garment, sprinkled with blood, and His Name is called,  The Word of God . And the armies that are in heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean'(verse 13). Such is the Captain of the Lord's Host, and such are His soldiers. He and they ride on white horses, which means, that their cause is innocent, and upright and pure. Warriors of this world wage unjust wars, but our Almighty Leader fights for a heavenly cause and with heavenly weaponsand in like manner His soldiers fight the good fight of faith; they fight against their and their Master's three great enemies, the World, the Flesh, and the Devil. He is covered with blood, but it is His own blood, which He shed for our redemption. And His followers are red with blood, but still again it is His blood, for it is written 'they have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb' (Apoc. vii. 14). And again He and they are certain of victory because it is said 'He went forth conquering that He might conquer' (Apoc. vi. 2). So let us say with the Psalmist 'Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O Thou most mighty  Because of truth and meekness and justice Thy right hand shall conduct Thee wonderfully' (Psalm xliv. 4-5).   Let us pray for the whole Church Militant here upon earth.   O Lion of the Tribe of Judah, the root of David, who fightest the good fight, and hast called on all men to join Thee, give Thy courage and strength to all Thy soldiers over the whole earth, who are fighting under the standard of Thy Cross. Give grace to every one in his own place to fight Thy battle well. Be with Thy missionaries in pagan lands, put right words into their mouths, prosper their labours, and sustain them under their sufferings with Thy consolations, and carry them on, even through torment and blood (if it be necessary), to their reward in heaven. Give the grace of wisdom to those in high station, that they may neither yield to fear, nor be seduced by flattery. Make them prudent as serpents, and simple as doves. Give Thy blessing to all preachers and teachers, that they may speak Thy words and persuade their hearers to love Thee. Be with all faithful servants of Thine, whether in low station or in high, who mix in the world; instruct them how to speak and how to act every hour of the day, so as to preserve their own souls from evil and to do good to their companions and associates. Teach us, one and all, to live in thy presence and to see Thee, our Great Leader, and Thy Crossand thus to fight valiantly and to overcome, that at the last we may sit down with Thee in Thy Throne, as Thou also hast overcome and art set down with Thy Father in His Throne.

        The summer of 1839  was a turning point for the Anglican clergyman and Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford,  John Henry Newman. He had been energetically leading the charge to restore the Church of England to what he believed to be her rightful heritage of "Catholicity", inherited from the undivided Church represented by the Church Fathers, yet free from what he would have ( and did) refer to as the corruptions of "Romanism".  Now that the students to whom he had been preaching at St. Mary's Church had gone home , he had time to do what he had done for many summer vacations: read the Fathers of the Church. However, this time his reading was to turn him in a new direction- unexpected, unwelcome and frightening....  "The Long Vacation of 1839 began early. There had been a great many visitors to Oxford from Easter to Commemoration; and Dr. Pusey and myself  had attracted attention, more, I think, than in any former year. I had put away from me the controversy with Rome for more than two years. In my Parochial Sermons the subject had never  been introduced: there had been nothing for two years, either in my Tracts or in the British Critic, of a polemical character. I was returning, for the Vacation, to the course of reading which I had many years before chosen as especially my own. I have no reason to suppose that the thoughts of Rome came across my mind at all. About the middle of June I began to study and master the history of the Monophysites. I was absorbed in the doctrinal question. This was from about June 13th to August 30th. It was during this course of reading that for the first time a doubt came upon me of the tenableness of Anglicanism. I recollect on the 30th of July mentioning to a friend, whom I had accidentally met, how remarkable the history was; but by the end of August I was seriously alarmed.  I have described in a former work, how the history affected me. My stronghold was Antiquity; now here, in the middle of the fifth century, I found, as it seemed to me, Christendom of the sixteenth and the nineteenth centuries reflected. I saw my face in that mirror, and I was a Monophysite. The Church of the  Via Media  was in the position of the Oriental communion, Rome was, where she now is; and the Protestants were the Eutychians. Of all passages of history, since history has been, who would have thought of going to the sayings and doings of old Eutyches, that  delirus senex , as (I think) Petavius calls him, and to the enormities of the unprincipled Dioscorus, in order to be converted to Rome!  Now let it be simply understood that I am not writing controversially, but with the one object of relating things as they happened to me in the course of my conversion. With this view I will quote a passage from the account, which I gave in 1850, of my reasonings and feelings in 1839:  'It was difficult to make out how the Eutychians or Monophysites were heretics, unless Protestants and Anglicans were heretics also; difficult to find arguments against the Tridentine Fathers, which did not tell against the Fathers of Chalcedon; difficult to condemn the Popes of the sixteenth century, without condemning the Popes of the fifth. The drama of religion, and the combat of truth and error, were ever one and the same. The principles and proceedings of the Church now, were those of the Church then; the principles and proceedings of heretics then, were those of Protestants now. I found it so,almost fearfully; there was an awful similitude, more awful, because so silent and unimpassioned, between the dead records of the past and the feverish chronicle of the present. The shadow of the fifth century was on the sixteenth. It was like a spirit rising from the troubled waters of the old world, with the shape and lineaments of the new. The Church then, as now, might be called peremptory and stern, resolute, overbearing, and relentless; and heretics were shifting, changeable, reserved, and deceitful, ever courting civil power, and never agreeing together, except by its aid; and the civil power was ever aiming at comprehensions, trying to put the invisible out of view, and substituting expediency for faith. What was the use of continuing the controversy, or defending my position, if, after all, I was forging arguments for Arius or Eutyches, and turning devil's advocate against the much-enduring Athanasius and the majestic Leo? Be my soul with the Saints! and shall I lift up my hand against them? Sooner may my right hand forget her cunning, and wither outright, as his who once stretched it out against a prophet of God! ' " -   Apologia Pro Vita Sua   This was the beginning- his journey on the 'road to Rome' would last six difficult and painful years.

       From "Christ Upon the Waters",   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " If Satan can so well avail himself even of the gifts and glories of the Church, it is not wonderful that he can be skilful also in his exhibition and use of those offences and scandals which are his own work in her now or in former times. My Brethren, she has scandals, she has a reproach, she has a shame: no Catholic will deny it. She has ever had the reproach and shame of being the mother of children unworthy of her. She has good children;she has many more bad. Such is the will of God, as declared from the beginning. He might have formed a pure Church; but He has expressly predicted that the cockle, sown by the enemy, shall remain with the wheat, even to the harvest at the end of the world. He pronounced that His Church should be like a fisher's net, gathering of every kind, and not examined till the evening. Nay, more than this, He declared that the bad and imperfect should far surpass the good. 'Many are called,' He said, 'but few are chosen'; and His Apostle speaks of 'a remnant saved according to the election of grace.' There is ever, then, an abundance of materials in the lives and the histories of Catholics; ready to the use of those opponents who, starting with the notion that the Holy Church is the work of the devil, wish to have some corroboration of their leading idea. Her very prerogative gives special opportunity for it; I mean, that she is the Church of all lands and of all times. If there was a Judas among the Apostles, and a Nicholas among the deacons, why should we be surprised that in the course of eighteen hundred years, there should be flagrant instances of cruelty, of unfaithfulness, of hypocrisy, or of profligacy, and that not only in the Catholic people, but in high places, in royal palaces, in bishops' households, nay, in the seat of St. Peter itself? Why need it surprise, if in barbarous ages, or in ages of luxury, there have been bishops, or abbots, or priests who have forgotten themselves and their God, and served the world or the flesh, and have perished in that evil service? What triumph is it, though in a long line of between two and three hundred popes, amid martyrs, confessors, doctors, sage rulers, and loving fathers of their people, one, or two, or three are found who fulfil the Lord's description of the wicked servant, who began 'to strike the manservants and maidservants, and to eat and drink and be drunk'? What will come of it, though we grant that at this time or that, here or there, mistakes in policy, or ill-advised measures, or timidity, or vacillation in action, or secular maxims, or inhumanity, or narrowness of mind have seemed to influence the Church's action, or her bearing towards her children? I can only say that, taking man as he is, it would be a miracle were such offences altogether absent from her history. Consider what it is to be left to oneself and one's conscience, without others'  judgment on what we do, which at times is the case with all men; consider what it is to have easy opportunities of sinning; and then cast the first stone at churchmen who have abused their freedom from control, or independence of criticism. My Brethren, with such considerations before me, I do not wonder that these scandals take place; which, of course, are the greater in proportion as the field on which they are found is larger and wider, and the more shocking in proportion as the profession of sanctity, under which they exhibit themselves, is more prominent. What religious body can compare with us in duration or in extent? There are crimes enough to be found in the members of all denominations: if there are passages in our history, the like of which do not occur in the annals of Wesleyanism or of Independency, or the other religions of the day, recollect there have been no Anabaptist pontiffs, no Methodist kings, no Congregational monasteries, no Quaker populations. Let the tenets of Irving or Swedenborg spread, as they never can, through the world, and we should see if, amid the wealth, and power, and station which would accrue to their holders, they would bear their faculties more meekly than Catholics have done.

       The Antipodean  reveals that his atttitude on Protestantism is  urlLink  pretty similar to mine.    I'd add a quote from Msgr. Ronald Knox's  The Belief of Catholics  .  "For three centuries the true issue between the two parties was obscured, owing to the preposterous action of the Protestants in admiring Biblical inspiration. The Bible, it appeared, was common ground between the combatants, the Bible, therefore, was the arena of the struggle; from it the controversialist, like David at the brook, must pick up texts to sling at hus adversary. In fact, of course, the Protestant had no conceivable right to base any arguments on the inspiration of the Bible, for the inspiration of the Bible was a doctrine which had been believed, before the Reformation, on the mere authority of the Church; it rested on exactly the same basis as the doctrine of Transubstantiation. Protestantism repudiated Transubstantiation, and in doing so repudiated the authority of the Church; and then, without a shred of logic, calmly went on believing in the inspiration of the Bible, as if nothing had happenedl Did they suppose that Biblical inspiration was a self-evident fact, like the axioms of Euclid ? Or did they derive it from some words of our Lord? If so, what words? What authority have we, apart from that of the Church, to say that the Epistles of Paul are inspired, and the Epistle of Barnabas is not? It is, perhaps, the most amazing and the most tragic spectacle in the history of thought, the picture of blood flowing, fires blazing, and kingdoms changing hands for a century and a half, all in defence of a vicious circle.

        As the Processional Hymn at Mass today...  we sang one of my favorites, "Faith of Our Fathers". Besides the fact that it's simply a great hymn, I have two ulterior motives in liking it: 1. The "fathers chained in prisons dark" is a reference to my much-loved  urlLink martyrs of England and Wales.   (The reference is, of course, suitable for other martyrs as well- hence the use of this hymn for today's Solemnity.)  2. The author of the words was an Oratorian:  urlLink  Fr. Frederick Faber, C.O.   (Although, alas ! Fr. Faber and Venerable Newman had some serious disagreements- but that is a long and complicated story !) The original words to the hymn tend to be modified when sung in this country. There is a specific reference to Faber's homeland, England, in the lyrics, and I have no problem with a slight change to make it suitable for use in the US. However, other modifications are sometimes made, weakening the specifically Catholic doctrines implied in the words, eliminating the references to Our Lady's intercession or to martyrdom.  Here are the lyrics, as printed by Fr. Faber in his book , "Hymns".   Faith of Our Fathers   "Faith of our Fathers!  living still  In spite of dungeon, fire and sword:  O how our hearts beat high with joy  Whene'er we hear that glorious word:  Faith of our Fathers! Holy Faith!  We will be true to Thee till death.  Our Fathers, chained in prisons dark,  Were still in heart and conscience free: How sweet would be their children's fate,  If they, like them could die for thee!  Faith of our Fathers! Holy Faith!  We will be true to thee till death!   Faith of our Fathers! Mary's prayers Shall win our country back to thee;  And through the truth that comes from God  England shall then indeed be free.  Faith of our Fathers! Holy Faith!  We will be true to thee till death!   Faith of our Fathers ! we will love  Both friend and foe in all our strife;  And preach thee, too, as love knows how,  By kindly words and virtuous life.  Faith of our Fathers! Holy Faith!  We will be true to Thee till death! "

       The Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul, Apostles  is today. There is information on them  urlLink  here   and   urlLink  here.    "We ought to desire to do great things for the service of God, and not content ourselves with a moderate goodness, but wish, if it were possible, to surpass in sanctity and love even St. Peter and St. Paul. " - St. Philip Neri   "In such a time as this did the prince of the Apostles, the first Pope, advance towards the heathen city, where, under a Divine guidance, he was to fix his seat. He toiled along the stately road which led him straight onwards to the capital of the world. He met throngs of the idle and the busy, of strangers and natives, who peopled the interminable suburb. He passed under the high gate, and wandered on amid marble palaces and columned temples; he met processions of heathen priests and ministers in honour of their idols; he met the wealthy lady, borne on her litter by her slaves; he met the stern legionaries who had been the 'massive iron hammers' of the whole earth; he met the anxious politician with his ready man of business at his side to prompt him on his canvass for popularity; he met the orator returning home from a successful pleading, with his young admirers and his grateful and hopeful clients. He saw about him nothing but tokens of a vigorous power, grown up into a definite establishment, formed and matured in its religion, its laws, its civil traditions, its imperial extension, through the history of many centuries; and what was he but a poor, feeble, aged stranger, in nothing different from the multitude of menan Egyptian or a Chaldean, or perhaps a Jew, some Eastern or otheras passers-by would guess according to their knowledge of human kind, carelessly looking at him (as we might turn our eyes upon Hindoo or gipsy, as they met us), without the shadow of a thought that such a one was destined then to commence an age of religious sovereignty, in which they might spend their own heathen times twice over, and not see its end! "-  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  "Prospects of the Catholic Missioner",   Discourses to Mixed Congregations     Various blogs have posts on the feast, including  urlLink  A Catholic Blog for Lovers ,  urlLink  Dappled Things ,  urlLink The Blog from the Core , and  urlLink  A Catholic Point of View  .

       Jesus the Light of the Soul  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    Mane nobiscum, Domine, quoniam advesperascit. Stay with us, because it is towards evening.   1. I adore Thee, O my God, as the true and only Light! From Eternity to Eternity, before any creature was, when Thou wast alone, alone but not solitary, for Thou hast ever been Three in One, Thou wast the Infinite Light. There was none to see Thee but Thyself. The Father saw that Light in the Son, and the Son in the Father. Such as Thou wast in the beginning, such Thou art now. Most separate from all creatures in this Thy uncreated Brightness. Most glorious, most beautiful. Thy attributes are so many separate and resplendent colours, each as perfect in its own purity and grace as if it were the sole and highest perfection. Nothing created is more than the very shadow of Thee. Bright as are the Angels, they are poor and most unworthy shadows of Thee. They pale and look dim and gather blackness before Thee. They are so feeble beside Thee, that they are unable to gaze upon Thee. The highest Seraphim veil their eyes, by deed as well as by word proclaiming Thy unutterable glory. For me, I cannot even look upon the sun, and what is this but a base material emblem of Thee? How should I endure to look even on an Angel? and how could I look upon Thee and live? If I were placed in the illumination of Thy countenance, I should shrink up like the grass. O most gracious God, who shall approach Thee, being so glorious, yet how can I keep from Thee?  2. How can I keep from Thee? For Thou, who art the Light of Angels, art the only Light of my soul. Thou enlightenest every man that cometh into this world. I am utterly dark, as dark as hell, without Thee. I droop and shrink when Thou art away. I revive only in proportion as Thou dawnest upon me. Thou comest and goest at Thy will. O my God, I cannot keep Thee! I can only beg of Thee to stay. ' Mane nobiscum, Domine, quoniam advesperascit .' Remain till morning, and then go not without giving me a blessing. Remain with me till death in this dark valley, when the darkness will end. Remain, O Light of my soul,  jam advesperascit ! The gloom, which is not Thine, falls over me. I am nothing. I have little command of myself. I cannot do what I would. I am disconsolate and sad. I want something, I know not what. It is Thou that I want, though I so little understand this. I say it and take it on faith; I partially understand it, but very poorly. Shine on me,  O Ignis semper ardens et nunquam deficiens !'O fire ever burning and never failing'and I shall begin, through and in Thy Light, to see Light, and to recognise Thee truly, as the Source of Light.  Mane nobiscum ; stay, sweet Jesus, stay for ever. In this decay of nature, give more grace.  3. Stay with me, and then I shall begin to shine as Thou shinest: so to shine as to be a light to others. The light, O Jesus, will be all from Thee. None of it will be mine. No merit to me. It will be Thou who shinest through me upon others. O let me thus praise Thee, in the way which Thou dost love best, by shining on all those around me. Give light to them as well as to me; light them with me, through me. Teach me to show forth Thy praise, Thy truth, Thy will. Make me preach Thee without preachingnot by words, but by my example and by the catching force, the sympathetic influence, of what I doby my visible resemblance to Thy saints, and the evident fulness of the love which my heart bears to Thee.

        For Saturday   "We have all of us this instinct about our Blessed Lady, that she is not merely the Mother of all our fallen race, but the Mother of each of us individually; not our Mother, but my Mother. Protestants sometimes laugh at us because we address ourselves now to our Lady of Perpetual Succour, now to our Lady of Good Counsel, now to our Lady of Lourdes, and so on, as if they were so many different people. But the case is far worse than that, if they only knew; every individual Catholic has a separate 'our Lady' to pray to, his Mother, the one who seems to care for him individually, has won him so many favours, has stood by him in so many difficulties, as if she had no other thought or business in heaven but to watch over him.

       For Friday  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "1. Place yourself in the presence of God, kneeling with hands clasped.  2. Read slowly and devoutly  St. Luke xxii. verses 40 to 46 (as it occurs in the Passion on Holy Wednesday).  3. Bring what you have read before you, as a picture.  4. Then say to Him whatever comes into your mind to say; for instance:  (1) What is it that bows down the Almighty Son of God? What is it that so terrifies and overwhelms my dear Saviour? What is it that thus convulses Him from head to foot? See how He trembles! He falls on his knees as under a tremendous load! His flesh quivers, and at length out of its pores comes a dew. It is red, and it trickles down Him, and falls heavily on the ground. It is His precious blood, and this is His agony.  (2) Alas! I know well enough what was the cause of it. He came on earth to undergo it, and to destroy it by undergoing it. It is the weight of sin. The sins of every child of Adam, of the whole race, were all then heaped into one mass, higher than the mountains, and placed upon His head. The burden would have crushed anyone else, even the highest Archangel, even the Blessed Mother of God. One human heart alone could undergo it, the heart of the Divine Son; yet see how His soul and body agonised with it, though it was the soul and body of God Incarnate.  (3) My most dear Saviour, give me some little tenderness to grieve for Thee suffering for me.  5. Conclusion.My dear Mother Mary, thou wert sinless, teach me to grieve with Thee.

       The Kingdom of God  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "1. My Lord Jesus, how wonderful were those conversations which Thou didst hold from time to time with Thy disciples after Thy resurrection. When Thou wentest with two of them to Emmaus, Thou didst explain all the prophecies which related to Thyself. And Thou didst commit to the Apostles the Sacraments in fulness, and the truths which it was Thy will to reveal, and the principles and maxims by which Thy Church was to be maintained and governed. And thus Thou didst prepare them against the day of Pentecost (as the risen bodies were put into shape for the Spirit in the Prophet's Vision), when life and illumination was to be infused into them. I will think over all Thou didst say to them with a true and simple faith. The "kingdom of God" was Thy sacred subject. Let me never for an instant forget that Thou hast established on earth a kingdom of Thy own, that the Church is Thy work, Thy establishment, Thy instrument; that we are under Thy rule, Thy laws and Thy eyethat when the Church speaks Thou dost speak. Let not familiarity with this wonderful truth lead me to be insensible to itlet not the weakness of Thy human representatives lead me to forget that it is Thou who dost speak and act through them. It was just when Thou wast going away, that then Thou didst leave this kingdom of Thine to take Thy place on to the end of the world, to speak for Thee, as Thy visible form, when Thy Personal Presence, sensible to man, was departing. I will in true loving faith bring Thee before me, teaching all the truths and laws of this kingdom to Thy Apostles, and I will adore Thee, while in my thoughts I gaze upon Thee and listen to Thy words.  2. Come, O my dear Lord, and teach me in like manner. I need it not, and do not ask it, as far as this, that the word of truth which in the beginning was given to the Apostles by Thee, has been handed down from age to age, and has already been taught to me, and Thy Infallible Church is the warrant of it. But I need Thee to teach me day by day, according to each day's opportunities and needs. I need Thee to give me that true Divine instinct about revealed matters that, knowing one part, I may be able to anticipate or to approve of others. I need that understanding of the truths about Thyself which may prepare me for all Thy other truthsor at least may save me from conjecturing wrongly about them or commenting falsely upon them. I need the mind of the Spirit, which is the mind of the holy Fathers, and of the Church by which I may not only say what they say on definite points, but think what they think; in all I need to be saved from an originality of thought, which is not true if it leads away from Thee. Give me the gift of discriminating between true and false in all discourse of mind.  3. And, for that end, give me, O my Lord, that purity of conscience which alone can receive, which alone can improve Thy inspirations. My ears are dull, so that I cannot hear Thy voice. My eyes are dim, so that I cannot see Thy tokens. Thou alone canst quicken my hearing, and purge my sight, and cleanse and renew my heart. Teach me, like Mary, to sit at Thy feet, and to hear Thy word. Give me that true wisdom, which seeks Thy will by prayer and meditation, by direct intercourse with Thee, more than by reading and reasoning. Give me the discernment to know Thy voice from the voice of strangers, and to rest upon it and to seek it in the first place, as something external to myself; and answer me through my own mind, if I worship and rely on Thee as above and beyond it.

        The Wall Street Journal   has a piece on  urlLink  efforts to limit or eliminate eulogies.   I seriously dislike eulogies at Catholic funerals- the point is to pray for the deceased's soul, not to give him the 'instant canonization' all too commonly present in eulogies. However, I'll admit it- I would really like to have been there when the one guy in the pews stood up and 'ruined' a set of eulogies by publicly stating that the deceased was 'a no-good S.O.B. '  !

        From "Neglect of Divine Calls and Warnings",    Discourses to Mixed Congregations    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Thousands are dying daily; they are waking up into God's everlasting wrath; they look back on the days of the flesh, and call them few and evil; they despise and scorn the very reasonings which then they trusted, and which have been disproved by the event; they curse the recklessness which made them put off repentance; they have fallen under His justice, whose mercy they presumed upon;and their companions and friends are going on as they did, and are soon to join them. As the last generation presumed, so does the present. The father would not believe that God could punish, and now the son will not believe; the father was indignant when eternal pain was spoken of, and the son gnashes his teeth and smiles contemptuously. The world spoke well of itself thirty years ago, and so will it thirty years to come. And thus it is that this vast flood of life is carried on from age to age; myriads trifling with God's love, tempting His justice, and like the herd of swine, falling headlong down the steep! O mighty God! O God of love! it is too much! it broke the heart of Thy sweet Son Jesus to see the misery of man spread out before His eyes. He died by it as well as for it. And we, too, in our measure, our eyes ache, and our hearts sicken, and our heads reel, when we but feebly contemplate it. O most tender heart of Jesus, why wilt Thou not end, when wilt Thou end, this ever-growing load of sin and woe? When wilt Thou chase away the devil into his own hell, and close the pit's mouth, that Thy chosen may rejoice in Thee, quitting the thought of those who perish in their wilfulness? But, oh! by those five dear Wounds in Hands, and Feet, and Sideperpetual founts of mercy, from which the fulness of the Eternal Trinity flows ever fresh, ever powerful, ever bountiful to all who seek Theeif the world must still endure, at least gather Thou a larger and a larger harvest, an ampler proportion of souls out of it into Thy garner, that these latter times may, in sanctity, and glory, and the triumphs of Thy grace, exceed the former.   'Deus misereatur nostri, et benedicat nobis ;' 'God, have mercy on us, and bless us; and cause His face to shine upon us, and have mercy on us; that we may know Thy way upon earth, Thy salvation among all the nations. Let the people praise Thee, O God; let all the people praise Thee. Let the nations be glad, and leap for joy; because Thou dost judge the people in equity, and dost direct the nations on the earth. God, even our God, bless us, may God bless us; and may all the ends of the earth fear Him.' "

        From  An Essay in aid of a Grammar of Assent    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " I can understand the  rabbia  of a native of Southern Europe, if I am of a passionate temper myself; and the taste for speculation or betting found in great traders or on the turf, if I am fond of enterprise or games of chance; but on the other hand, not all the possible descriptions of headlong love will make me comprehend the  delirium , if I never have had a fit of it; nor will ever so many sermons about the inward satisfaction of strict conscientiousness create in my mind the image of a virtuous action and its attendant sentiments, if I have been brought up to lie, thieve and indulge my appetites. Thus we meet with men of the world who cannot enter into the very idea of devotion, and think, for instance, that, from the nature of the case, a life of religious seclusion must be either one of unutterable dreariness or abandoned sensuality, because they know of no exercise of the affections but what is merely human; and with others again, who, living in the home of their own selfishness, ridicule as something fanatical and pitiable the self-sacrifices of generous high-mindedness and chivalrous honour. They cannot create images of these things, any more than children on the contrary can of vice, when they ask whereabouts and who the bad men are; for they have no personal memories, and have to content themselves with notions drawn from books or from what others tell them."

       Jesus our Guide and Guardian  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " There  are men who think that God is so great that He disdains to look down upon  us , our doings and our fortunes. But He who did not find it beneath His Majesty to make us, does not think it beneath Him to observe and to visit us. He says Himself in the Gospel: 'Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? and not one of them is forgotten before God. Yea, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows.' He determined from all eternity that He would create us. He settled our whole fortuneand, if He did not absolutely decree to bring us to heaven, it is because we have free will, and by the very constitution of our nature He has put it in part out of His own power, for we must do  our   part, if to heaven we attain. But He has done every thing short of this. He died for us all upon the Cross, that, if it were possible to save us, we might be saved. And He calls upon us lovingly, begging us to accept the benefit of His meritorious and most Precious Blood. And those who trust Him He takes under His special protection. He marks out their whole life for them; He appoints all that happens to them; He guides them in such way as to secure their salvation; He gives them just so much of health, of wealth, of friends, as is best for them; He afflicts them only when it is for their good; He is never angry with them. He measures out just that number of years which is good for them; and He appoints the hour of their death in such a way as to secure their perseverance up to it.   Let us pray for ourselves and for all our needs.   O my Lord and Saviour, in Thy arms I am safe; keep me and I have nothing to fear; give me up and I have nothing to hope for. I know not what will come upon me before I die. I know nothing about the future, but I rely upon Thee. I pray Thee to give me what is good for me; I pray Thee to take from me whatever may imperil my salvation; I pray Thee not to make me rich, I pray Thee not to make me very poor; but I leave it all to Thee, because Thou knowest and I do not. If Thou bringest pain or sorrow on me, give me grace to bear it wellkeep me from fretfulness and selfishness. If Thou givest me health and strength and success in this world, keep me ever on my guard lest these great gifts carry me away from Thee. O Thou who didst die on the Cross for me, even for me, sinner as I am, give me to know Thee, to believe on Thee, to love Thee, to serve Thee; ever to aim at setting forth Thy glory; to live to and for Thee; to set a good example to all around me; give me to die just at that time and in that way which is most for Thy glory, and best for my salvation.

        For Saturday   Mary is the "Sedes Sapientiae," the Seat of Wisdom  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Mary has this title in her Litany, because the Son of God, who is also called in Scripture the Word and Wisdom of God, once dwelt in her, and then, after His birth of her, was carried in her arms and seated in her lap in His first years. Thus, being, as it were, the human throne of Him who reigns in heaven, she is called the  Seat of Wisdom . In the poet's words:  His throne, thy bosom blest, O Mother undefiled, That Throne, if aught beneath the skies, Beseems the sinless Child.  But the possession of her Son lasted beyond His infancyHe was under her rule, as St. Luke tells us, and lived with her in her house, till He went forth to preachthat is, for at least a whole thirty years. And this brings us to a reflection about her, cognate to that which was suggested to us yesterday  by the title of 'Mirror of Justice.' For if such close and continued intimacy with her Son created in her a sanctity inconceivably great, must not also the knowledge which she gained during those many years from His conversation of present, past, and future, have been so large, and so profound, and so diversified, and so thorough, that, though she was a poor woman without human advantages, she must in her knowledge of creation, of the universe, and of history, have excelled the greatest of philosophers, and in her theological knowledge the greatest of theologians, and in her prophetic discernment the most favoured of prophets?  What was the grand theme of conversation between her and her Son but the nature, the attributes, the providence, and the works of Almighty God? Would not our Lord be ever glorifying the Father who sent Him? Would He not unfold to her the solemn eternal decrees, and the purposes and will of God? Would He not from time to time enlighten her in all those points of doctrine which have been first discussed and then settled in the Church from the time of the Apostles till now, and all that shall be till the end,nay, these, and far more than these? All that is obscure, all that is fragmentary in revelation, would, so far as the knowledge is possible to man, be brought out to her in clearness and simplicity by Him who is the Light of the World.  And so of the events which are to come. God spoke to the Prophets: we have His communications to them in Scripture. But He spoke to them in figure and parable. There was one, viz., Moses, to whom He vouchsafed to speak face to face. 'If there be among you a prophet of the Lord,' God says, 'I will appear to him in a vision, and I will speak to him in a dream. But it is not so with my servant Moses ... For I will speak to him mouth to mouth, and plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord.' This was the great privilege of the inspired Lawgiver of the Jews; but how much was it below that of Mary! Moses had the privilege only now and then, from time to time; but Mary for thirty continuous years saw and heard Him, being all through that time face to face with Him, and being able to ask Him any question which she wished explained, and knowing that the answers she received were from the Eternal God, who neither deceives nor can be deceived.

        This sort of thing is inevitable...  once you start seeing children not as blessings from God, but as either designer accessories or accidents...  urlLink Doctor must pay to raise boy   The contraceptive culture continues its sinking spiral into nihilistic insanity.... though I must say  that the dissenting opinion quoted is a bright light in the darkness of this ruling.    In a strong dissenting judgement, Justice Dyson Heydon said: "A child is not an object for the gratification of its parents, like a pet or an antique car or a new dress . . . the child has a 'value' which must be fostered whether it pleases its parents or repels them. "   "It is contrary to human dignity to reduce the existence of a particular human being to the status of an animal or an inanimate chattel . . . It is wrong to attempt to place a value on human life or a value on the expense of human life because human life is invaluable - incapable of effective or useful valuation."

        Oh, please... not again !    I believe  urlLink Mr. Sullivan  and  urlLink Mr. Shea  are going down a bit of a blind alley here, as Mr. Halsall is   urlLink  a questionable source at best.  , as a  urlLink  perceptive commenter   urlLink  noted.    (As to the question of SSA and ordination now- I have no doubt such ordinations would be valid. Whether they would be prudent in a society as massively oversexualized as ours is another matter. )   Did the Venerable struggle with this type of temptation ? God only knows, as even the people who claim he did admit that if so, he did not give in to the temptation. However, using him to further the agenda of sexual perversion (as Mr. Halsall has done) is simply stupid.   " The graces of the Spirit cannot be separated from each other; one implies the rest; what is love but a delight in God, a devotion to Him, a surrender of the whole self to Him? what is impurity, on the other hand, but the turning to something of this world, something sinful, as the object of our affections instead of God? What is it but a deliberate abandonment of the Creator for the creature, and seeking pleasure in the shadow of death, not in the all-blissful Presence of light and holiness? The impure then cannot love God; and those who are without love of God cannot really be pure. Purity prepares the soul for love, and love confirms the soul in purity. The flame of love will not be bright unless the substance which feeds it be pure and unadulterate; and the most dazzling purity is but as iciness and desolation unless it draws its life from fervent love.

        Lovely little bit of inspiration  courtesy of  urlLink  Zenit.      Quadriplegic Priest Carves Out an Apostolate on Internet   Father Luis de Moya a Point of Reference on Euthanasia  PAMPLONA, Spain, JULY 15, 2003 (Zenit.org).- A Spanish Web page that opposes euthanasia is manned by someone who, according to the promoters of a "gentle death," should have died years ago.   Father Luis de Moya lost the use of his limbs in an accident more than a decade ago, but he manages to run the Web site through technology that allows him to dictate to a computer.   He began to study medicine in Madrid in 1971. The following year, he applied for admission to the Opus Dei. After his studies, he went to Rome to study theology and then returned to Spain for his priestly ordination.   In addition to being a physician, Father de Moya has a doctorate in canon law. He has been in charge of several chaplaincies at the University of Navarre. He still keep at this work today, combining it with his Web pages dedicated to the struggle for life and the dignity of the person.   "I had a traffic accident in April 1991 and, as a consequence, remained quadriplegic," he explains in the book "Along the Way." The book is published in Spanish, French, Portuguese and Italian.   The Internet phenomenon was a discovery. "I soon realized that the concept 'border' hardly exists on the network," he told ZENIT. "I thought it would be terrible, therefore, if I did not reach as many computers as possible with the best content I could contribute."   Father de Moya's battle in defense of life is now spreading throughout Europe. He is currently engaged in a lengthy debate, after posting on his Web page a letter from the mother of Carolina Bustos Flores.   Bustos, who lives in Rotterdam, is accusing the doctors of the Dutch Dijkzigt Ziekenhuis Hospital of letting her 25-year-old daughter die. The letter is entitled "Chronicle of a Forced Euthanasia."   Father de Moya also has, in Spanish, a Web page on spirituality, philosophy and theology (www.fluvium.org) and a personal page (www.luisdemoya.org).

         From  Certain Difficulties Felt by Anglicans in Catholic Teaching, Volume 1    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " We may entertain most reasonable hopes that vast multitudes are in a state of invincible ignorance; so that those among them who are living a life really religious and conscientious, may be looked upon with interest and even pleasure, though a mournful pleasure, in the midst of the pain which a Catholic feels at their ignorant prejudices against what he knows to be true. Amongst the most bitter railers against the Church in this country, may be found those who are influenced by divine grace, and are at present travelling towards heaven, whatever be their ultimate destiny. Among the most irritable disputants against the Sacrifice of the Mass or Transubstantiation, or the most impatient listeners to the glories of Mary, there may be those for whom she is saying to her Son, what He said on the cross to His Father, 'Forgive them, for they know not what they do.' Nay, while such persons think as at present, they are bound to act accordingly, and only so far to connect themselves with us as their conscience allows. 'When persons who have been brought up in heresy,' says a Catholic theologian, 'are persuaded from their childhood that we are the enemies of God's word, are idolaters, pestilent deceivers, and therefore, as pests, to be avoided, they cannot, while this persuasion lasts, hear us with a safe conscience, and they labour under invincible ignorance, inasmuch as they doubt not that they are in a good way?'

        Just because   " Thus in after days, what by the voyages of ships, what by lore and star-craft, the kings of Men knew that the world was indeed made round, and yet the Eldar were permitted still to depart and to come to the Ancient West and to Avall&oacute;n&euml; , if they would. Therefore the loremasters of Men said that a Straight Road must still be, for those that were permitted to find it. And they taught that, while the new world fell away, the old road and the path of the memory of the West still went on, as it were a mighty bridge invisible that passed through the air of breath and flight        (which now were bent as the world was bent) and traversed Ilmen which flesh unaided cannot endure, until it came to Tol Eress&euml;a, the Lonely Isle, and maybe even beyond, to Valinor, where the Valar still dwell and watch the unfolding of the story of the world. And tales and rumours arose along the shores of the sea concerning mariners and men forlorn upon the water who, by some fate or grace or favour of the Valar, had entered in upon the Striaght Way and saw the face of the world sink beneath them, and so had come to the lamplit quays of Avall&oacute;n&euml; , or verily to the last beaches on the margins of Aman, and there had looked upon the White Mountain, dreadful and beautiful, before they died.

       Since I can no longer blog on Sundays....  I'm a day late with this: On July 13, 1852, at the first Provincial Synod of Westminster, Venerable John Henry Newman preached what is considered by many to be his finest sermon,  urlLink  The Second Spring.    The part about it being an uncertain, English spring is especially poignant when one remembers that when he was preaching this, Fr. Newman had just been through the harrowing ordeal of  urlLink  the Achilli Trial , a classic miscarriage of justice in which the word of one man prevailed over massive amounts of testimony, simply because he was perceived as being a victim of a "Romanist plot". (Even the  Times  of London, no friend of Catholicism, said that the proceedings were " indecorous in their nature, unsatisfactory in their result, and little calculated to increase the respect of the people for the administration of justice or the estimation by foreign nations of the English name and character. We consider that a great blow has been given to the administration of justice in this country, and that Roman Catholics will henceforth have only too good reason for asserting that there is no justice for them in cases tending to arouse the Protestant feelings of judges and juries." ) The Venerable had been enduring the storm, and it was not yet over- he had to wait months for sentencing, wondering whether or not he was going to end up in jail. (He made arrangements to celebrate Mass there, just in case, but as things turned out, he was not sent to prison- merely fined.)

        For Saturday  "I say then, when once we have mastered the idea, that Mary bore, suckled, and handled the Eternal in the form of a child, what limit is conceivable to the rush and flood of thoughts which such a doctrine involves? What awe and surprise must attend upon the knowledge, that a creature has been brought so close to the Divine Essence? It was the creation of a new idea and of a new sympathy, of a new faith and worship, when the holy Apostles announced that God had become incarnate; then a supreme love and devotion to Him became possible, which seemed hopeless before that revelation. This was the first consequence of their preaching. But, besides this, a second range of thoughts was opened on mankind, unknown before, and unlike any other, as soon as it was understood that that Incarnate God had a mother. The second idea is perfectly distinct from the former, and does not interfere with it. He is God made low, she is a woman made high. I scarcely like to use a familiar illustration on the subject of the Blessed Virgin's dignity among created beings, but it will serve to explain what I mean, when I ask you to consider the difference of feeling, with which we read the respective histories of Maria Theresa and the Maid of Orleans; or with which the middle and lower classes of a nation regard a first minister of the day who has come of an aristocratic house, and one who has risen from the ranks. May God's mercy keep me from the shadow of a thought, dimming the purity or blunting the keenness of that love of Him, which is our sole happiness and our sole salvation! But surely when He became man, He brought home to us His incommunicable attributes with a distinctiveness, which precludes the possibility of our lowering Him merely by our exalting a creature. He alone has an entrance into our soul, reads our secret thoughts, speaks to our heart, applies to us spiritual pardon and strength. On Him we solely depend. He alone is our inward life; He not only regenerates us, but (to use the words appropriated to a higher mystery)  semper gignit ; He is ever renewing our new birth and our heavenly sonship. In this sense He may be called, as in nature, so in grace, our real Father. Mary is only our mother by divine appointment, given us from the Cross; her presence is above, not on earth; her office is external, not within us. Her name is not heard in the administration of the Sacraments. Her work is not one of ministration towards us; her power is indirect. It is her prayers that avail, and her prayers are effectual by the  fiat  of Him who is our all in all. Nor need she hear us by any innate power, or any personal gift; but by His manifestation to her of the prayers which we make to her. When Moses was on the Mount, the Almighty told him of the idolatry of his people at the foot of it, in order that he might intercede for them; and thus it is the Divine Presence which is the intermediating Power by which we reach her and she reaches us. " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   A Letter Addressed to the Rev. E. B. Pusey, D.D.,on Occasion of His Eirenicon

        The June/July edition of   First Things    is  urlLink online .  urlLink  This article  by Mary Ann Glendon is worth a look. There are also interesting ones by Fr. Richard John Neuhaus on  urlLink  Christian unity  and  urlLink  sacred architecture , plus one on a blogger whose appeal puzzles me,  urlLink  Andrew Sullivan.  The  urlLink  While We're At It  section also contains some gems, such as this one:  Men are from Mars, women from Venus. I expect there is a strong measure of truth in that. At least men think they should act as though they are from Mars, which means, among other things, as though they are in control. I have written elsewhere that, as a general rule, women are much better around the sick and debilitated than men, not least because they have usually gone through the ordeal of bearing children. They are more at home with the messiness of life. Admittedly, these are generalizations, but they are brought to mind by a report on physician-assisted suicide in Oregon, the only state in which mercy killing is legal. According to American Medical News, the dominant (84 percent) reason for choosing death is the fear of losing autonomy and the ability to do the things one wants to do. A doctor with a suicide advocacy group says, The No. 1 reason given to me is: I dont want to have anyone wipe my rear end. That is the most humiliating aspect of terminal illness. Despite there being many more aged and debilitated women, 71 percent of those choosing suicide in Oregon are men.    There is also a link to one  urlLink  article   in the August/September edition, by Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J.

       For Thursday...   The Mass  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  1. I adore Thee, O my Lord God, with the most profound awe for thy passion and crucifixion, in sacrifice for our sins. Thou didst suffer incommunicable sufferings in Thy sinless soul. Thou wast exposed in Thy innocent body to ignominious torments, to mingled pain and shame. Thou wast stripped and fiercely scourged, Thy sacred body vibrating under the heavy flail as trees under the blast. Thou wast, when thus mangled, hung up upon the Cross, naked, a spectacle for all to see Thee quivering and dying. What does all this imply, O Mighty God! What a depth is here which we cannot fathom! My God, I know well, Thou couldst have saved us at Thy word, without Thyself suffering; but Thou didst choose to purchase us at the price of Thy Blood. I look on Thee, the Victim lifted up on Calvary, and I know and protest that that death of Thine was an expiation for the sins of the whole world. I believe and know, that Thou alone couldst have offered a meritorious atonement; for it was Thy Divine Nature which gave Thy sufferings worth.  Rather then than I should perish according to my deserts, Thou wast nailed to the Tree and didst die.  2. Such a sacrifice was not to be forgotten. It was not to beit could not bea mere event in the world's history, which was to be done and over, and was to pass away except in its obscure, unrecognised effects. If that great deed was what we believe it to be, what we know it is, it must remain present, though past; it must be a standing fact for all times. Our own careful reflection upon it tells us this; and therefore, when we are told that Thou, O Lord, though Thou hast ascended to glory, hast renewed and perpetuated Thy sacrifice to the end of all things, not only is the news most touching and joyful, as testifying to so tender a Lord and Saviour, but it carries with it the full assent and sympathy of our reason. Though we neither could, nor would have dared, anticipate so wonderful a doctrine, yet we adore its very suitableness to Thy perfections, as well as its infinite compassionateness for us, now that we are told of it. Yes, my Lord, though Thou hast left the world, Thou art daily offered up in the Mass; and, though Thou canst not suffer pain and death, Thou dost still subject Thyself to indignity and restraint to carry out to the full Thy mercies towards us. Thou dost humble Thyself daily; for, being infinite, Thou couldst not end Thy humiliation while they existed for whom Thou didst submit to it. So Thou remainest a Priest for ever.  3. My Lord, I offer Thee myself in turn as a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Thou hast died for me, and I  in turn make myself over to Thee. I am not my own. Thou hast bought me; I will by my own act and deed complete the purchase. My wish is to be separated from everything of this world; to cleanse myself simply from sin; to put away from me even what is innocent, if used for its own sake, and not for Thine. I put away reputation and honour, and influence, and power, for my praise and strength shall be in Thee. Enable me to carry out what I profess.    Meditations and Devotions

       I won't be able to blog tommorow..  due to Real Life, so I am posting two of my favorite selections from  The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien , both dated July 25, 1938, today. The Professor received a letter from a German publisher which wished to publish a translation of  The Hobbit  . However, they inquired whether or not he was of  arisch  (Aryan) extraction. The Professor promptly fired off two letters. The first was to his publisher, Stanley Unwin of Allen & Unwin. "I must say the enclosed letter from R&uuml;tten and Loening is a bit stiff. Do I suffer this impertinence because of the possession of a German name, or do their lunatic laws require a certificate of  arisch  origin from all persons of all countries ? Personally, I should be inclined to refuse to give any  Best&auml;tigung  (although it happens that I can) and let a German translation go hang. In any case I should object very strongly to any such declaration appearing in print. I do not regard the (probable) absence of any Jewish blood to be necessarily honourable; and I have many Jewish friends, and should regret giving any colour to the notion that I subscribed to the wholly pernicious and unscientific race-doctrine. " The second was to the German publisher. "Dear Sirs:   Thank you for your letter.... I regret that I am not clear as to what you intend by  arisch  . I am not of 'Aryan' extraction: that is Indo-Iranian: as far as I am aware none of my ancestors spoke Hindustanti, Persian, Gypsy, or related dialects. But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of   Jewish  origin, I can only reply that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject- which should be sufficent. I have been accustomed, none the less, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forebear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride. Your enquiry is doubtless made in order to comply with the laws of your own country, but that this should be held to apply to the subjects of another state would be improper, even if it had (as it has not) any bearing whatsoever on the merits of my work or its suitability for publication of which you appear to have satisfied yourselves without references to my   Abstammung . I trust you will find this reply satisfactory, and remain yours faithfully, J.R.R. Tolkien "   The German translation did 'go hang', until after WWII.

        From  The Idea of a University     by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Another reason of a kindred nature is to be found in the difference of method by which truths are gained in theology and in physical science. Induction is the instrument of Physics, and deduction only is the instrument of Theology. There the simple question is, What is revealed? all doctrinal knowledge flows from one fountain head. If we are able to enlarge our view and multiply our propositions, it must be merely by the comparison and adjustment of the original truths; if we would solve new questions, it must be by consulting old answers. The notion of doctrinal knowledge absolutely novel, and of simple addition from without, is intolerable to Catholic ears, and never was entertained by any one who was even approaching to an understanding of our creed. Revelation is all in all in doctrine; the Apostles its sole depository, the inferential method its sole instrument, and ecclesiastical authority its sole sanction. The Divine Voice has spoken once for all, and the only question is about its meaning. Now this process, as far as it was reasoning, was the very mode of reasoning which, as regards physical knowledge, the school of Bacon has superseded by the inductive method:no wonder, then, that that school should be irritated and indignant to find that a subject-matter remains still, in which their favourite instrument has no office; no wonder that they rise up against this memorial of an antiquated system, as an eyesore and an insult; and no wonder that the very force and dazzling success of their own method in its own departments should sway or bias unduly the religious sentiments of any persons who come under its influence. They assert that no new truth can be gained by deduction; Catholics assent, but add that, as regards religious truth, they have not to seek at all, for they have it already. Christian Truth is purely of revelation; that revelation we can but explain, we cannot increase, except relatively to our own apprehensions; without it we should have known nothing of its contents, with it we know just as much as its contents, and nothing more. And, as it was given by a divine act independent of man, so will it remain in spite of man. Niebuhr may revolutionize history, Lavoisier chemistry, Newton astronomy; but God Himself is the author as well as the subject of theology. When Truth can change, its Revelation can change; when human reason can outreason the Omniscient, then may it supersede His work.   Avowals such as these fall strange upon the ear of men whose first principle is the search after truth, and whose starting-points of search are things material and sensible. They scorn any process of inquiry not founded on experiment; the Mathematics indeed they endure, because that science deals with ideas, not with facts, and leads to conclusions hypothetical rather than real; 'Metaphysics' they even use as a by-word of reproach; and Ethics they admit only on condition that it gives up conscience as its scientific ground, and bases itself on tangible utility: but as to Theology, they cannot deal with it, they cannot master it, and so they simply outlaw it and ignore it. Catholicism, forsooth, 'confines the intellect,' because it holds that God's intellect is greater than theirs, and that what He has done, man cannot improve. "

        Got an invitation today...  from my friend Clare, asking me to come to the Mass where she will, God willing, become a Benedictine novice.  That will be on August 10th, at 10:30 am. Prayers for her and her community are,  of course, very welcome.

       The Evil of Sin   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "1. My God, I know that Thou didst create the whole universe very good; and if this was true of the material world which we see, much more true is it of the world of rational beings. The innumerable stars which fill the firmament, and the very elements out of which the earth is made, all are carried through their courses and their operations in perfect concord; but much higher was the concord which reigned in heaven when the Angels were first created. At that first moment of their existence the main orders of the Angels were in the most excellent harmony, and beautiful to contemplate; and the creation of man was expected next, to continue that harmony in the instance of a different kind of being. Then it was that suddenly was discovered a flaw or a rent in one point of this most delicate and exquisite weband it extended and unravelled the web, till a third part of it was spoilt; and then again a similar flaw was found in human kind, and it extended over the whole race. This dreadful evil, destroying so large a portion of all God's works, is sin.  2. My God, such is sin in Thy judgment; what is it in the judgment of the world? A very small evil or none at all. In the judgment of the Creator it is that which has marred His spiritual work; it is a greater evil than though the stars got loose, and ran wild in heaven, and chaos came again. But man, who is the guilty one, calls it by soft names. He explains it away. The world laughs at it, and is indulgent to it; and, as to its deserving eternal punishment, it rises up indignant at the idea, and rather than admit it, would deny the God who has said it does. The world thinks sin the same sort of imperfection as an impropriety, or want of taste or infirmity. O my soul, consider carefully the great difference between the views of sin taken by Almighty God and the world! Which of the two views do you mean to believe?  3. O my soul, which of the two wilt thou believethe word of God or the word of man? Is God right or is the creature right? Is sin the greatest of all possible evils or the least? My Lord and Saviour, I have no hesitation which to believe. Thou art true, and every man a liar. I will believe Thee, above the whole world. My God, imprint on my heart the infamous deformity of sin. Teach me to abhor it as a pestilenceas a fierce flame destroying on every side; as my death. Let me take up arms against it, and devote myself to fight under Thy banner in overcoming it. "      Meditations and Devotions

        I think I may have jumped the gun....  Some of my sources say that St. Philip was born on July 21st, but some say July 22nd.  Given his strong devotion to St. Mary Magdalene, the second date is looking more likely. Sorry for the error.

I mention him not only because he is one of my beloved  urlLink  Forty Martyrs of England and Wales , but because his name happens to be the same as that of one of my music teachers back in high school- now retired.

        From   Discourses to Mixed Congregations   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " The world then witnesses against you by being good friends with you; you could not have got on with the world so well, without surrendering something which was precious and sacred. The world likes you, all but your professed creed; distinguishes you from your creed in its judgment of you, and would fain separate you from it in fact. Men say, 'These persons are better than their Church; we have not a word to say for their Church; but Catholics are not what they were, they are very much like other men now. Their Creed certainly is bigoted and cruel, but what would you have of them? You cannot expect them to confess this; let them change quietly, no one changes in public,be satisfied that they are changed. They are as fond of the world as we are; they take up political objects as warmly; they like their own way just as well; they do not like strictness a whit better; they hate spiritual thraldom, and they are half ashamed of the Pope and his Councils. They hardly believe any miracles now, and are annoyed when their own brethren confess that there are such; they never speak of purgatory; they are sore about images; they avoid the subject of Indulgences; and they will not commit themselves to the doctrine of exclusive salvation. The Catholic doctrines are now mere badges of party. Catholics think for themselves and judge for themselves, just as we do; they are kept in their Church by a point of honour, and a reluctance at seeming to abandon a fallen cause.'  Such is the judgment of the world, and you, my brethren, are shocked to hear it;but may it not be, that the world knows more about you than you know about yourselves? 'If ye had been of the world,' says Christ, 'the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.' So speaks Christ of His Apostles. How run His words when applied to you? 'If ye be of the world, the world will love its own; therefore ye are of the world, and I have not chosen you out of the world, because the world doth love you.' Do not complain of the world's imputing to you more than is true; those who live as the world lives give countenance to those who think them of the world, and seem to form but one party with them. In proportion as you put off the yoke  of Christ, so does the world by a sort of instinct recognise you, and think well of you accordingly. Its highest compliment is to tell you that you disbelieve. O my brethren, there is an eternal enmity between the world and the Church. The Church declares by the mouth of an Apostle, 'Whoso will be a friend of the world, becomes an enemy of God;' and the world retorts, and calls the Church apostate, sorceress, Beelzebub, and Antichrist. She is the image and the mother of the predestinate, and, if you would be found among her children when you die, you must have part in her reproach while you live. Does not the world scoff at all that is glorious, all that is majestic, in our holy religion? Does it not speak against the special creations of God's grace? Does it not disbelieve the possibility of purity and chastity? Does it not slander the profession of celibacy? Does it not deny the virginity of Mary? Does it not cast out her very name as evil? Does it not scorn her as 'a dead woman,' whom you know to be the Mother of all the living, and the great Intercessor of the faithful? Does it not ridicule the Saints? Does it not make light of their relics? Does it not despise the Sacraments? Does it not blaspheme the awful Presence which dwells upon our altars, and mock bitterly and fiercely at our believing that what it calls bread and wine is that very same Body and Blood of the Lamb, which lay in Mary's womb and hung on the Cross? What are we, that we should be better treated than our Lord, and His Mother, and His servants, and His works? Nay, what are we, if we be better treated, but friends of those who thus treat us well, and who ill-treat Him? "

        For Saturday  "And above them(ed. the saints) all--for who would concede that place of honour more anxiously than themselves?--stands the Virgin Mother of Christ, the sorrowful Mother of us all. Not less intimate because so high above us, not loved less personally because her munificence is so wide, she permeates the thought, the art, the poetry, the lives of Catholics with radiance as of a spring day, or of good news heard suddenly. Protestants have said that we deify her; that is not because we exaggerate the eminence of God's mother, but because they belittle the eminence of God. A creature miraculously preserved from sin by the indwelling power of the Holy Ghost--that is to them a Divine title, because that is all the claim their grudging theologies will concede, often enough, to our Lord himself. They refuse honour to the God-bearing Woman because their Christ is only a God-bearing Man. We, who know that God could (if He would) annihilate every existing creature without abating anything of His Blessedness or His Glory, are not afraid less the honour done to His creature of perfect Womanhood should prejudice the honour due to Him. Touchstone of Truth in the ages of controversy, Romance of the medieval world, she has not lost, with the rise of new devotions, any fragment of her ancient glory. Other lights may glow and dim as the centuries pass, she cannot suffer change; and when a Catholic ceases to honour her, he ceases to be a Catholic. "- Msgr. Ronald Knox,   The Belief of Catholics

        Over at Catholic and Enjoying It    urlLink  Mark Shea  has a link to a Phyllis McGinley poem. This gives me the perfect opportunity to post another poem by Phyllis McGinley....  "When Philip Neri walked abroad   Beside the Tiber, praising God   They say he was attended home   By half the younger set of Rome.    Knight, novice, scholar, boisterous boy,   They followed after him with joy,   To nurse his poor and break his bread,   And hear the funny things he said.    For Philip Neri (by his birth   A Florentine) believed in mirth,   And held that virtue took no harm    That went with laughter arm-in-arm.     Two books he read with most affection-   The Gospels and a joke collection;   And sang hosannas set to fiddles,   And fed the sick on soup and riddles.    So when the grave rebuke the merry,   Let them remember Philip Neri   (Fifteen-fifteen to ninety-five),   Who was the merriest man alive,    Then dying at eighty or a bit   Became a Saint by holy wit.

        I agree ...  with  urlLink  Mark Shea ....  urlLink  This is evil.  Splitting up or uprooting families who haven't done anything wrong because one of them belongs to the wrong racial group is disgusting, and, IMHO, plays into the hands of anti-Israeli propagandists.  What really gets me is the quote near the end ... "Ezra turned aside charges that the law was racist, saying ``I agree that anyone who kills Jews just because they are Jewish is a racist. ' ''  Yes, Mr. Ezra. And anyone who rips apart or displaces a family just because one of them is an Arab is racist, too.

        For Thursday  "He tore open the solid rock; He rose from the tomb; He ascended on high; He is far off from the earth; He is safe from profanation; and the soul and body, which He assumed, partake of course, as far as created nature allows, of the Sovereign Freedom and the Independence of Omnipotence. It is not so: He is indeed beyond the reach of suffering; but you anticipate, my Brethren, what I have yet to say. Is He then so enamoured of the prison, that He should purpose to revisit earth again, in order that, as far as possible, He may undergo it still? Does He set such a value on subjection to His creatures, that, before He goes away, on the very eve of His betrayal, He must actually make provision, after death, for perpetuating His captivity to the end of the world? My Brethren, the great truth is daily before our eyes: He has ordained the standing miracle of His Body and Blood under visible symbols, that He may secure thereby the standing mystery of Omnipotence in bonds.  He took bread, and blessed, and made it His Body; He took wine, and gave thanks, and made it His Blood; and He gave His priests the power to do what He had done. Henceforth, He is in the hands of sinners once more. Frail, ignorant, sinful man, by the sacerdotal power given to him, compels the presence of the Highest; he lays Him up in a small tabernacle; he dispenses Him to a sinful people. Those who are only just now cleansed from mortal sin, open their lips for Him; those who are soon to return to mortal sin, receive Him into their breasts; those who are polluted with vanity and selfishness and ambition and pride, presume to make Him their guest; the frivolous, the tepid, the worldly-minded, fear not to welcome Him. Alas! alas! even those who wish to be more in earnest, entertain Him with cold and wandering thoughts, and quench that Love which would inflame them with Its own fire, did they but open to It. Such are the best of us; and then for the worst? O my Brethren, what shall we say of sacrilege? of His reception into hearts polluted with mortal, unforsaken sin? of those further nameless profanations, which from time to time occur, when unbelief dares to present itself at the Holy Altar, and blasphemously gains possession of Him?  My Brethren, it is plain that, when we confess God as Omnipotent only, we have gained but a half-knowledge of Him: His is an Omnipotence which can at the same time swathe Itself in infirmity and can become the captive of Its own creatures. He has, if I may so speak, the incomprehensible power of even making Himself weak. " - From "Omnipotence in Bonds", by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

        The Feast of St. Ignatius Loyola, Priest and Founder  is today. There is information on him  urlLink  here.  Prayers for the Society of Jesus, that they may truly follow the example of their founder and their multiplicity of magnificent saints, would be most welcome. ( I am, alas, that it seems that in too many cases they are going in the wrong direction- but prayer is powerful ! )   St. Ignatius, was a friend of St. Philip Neri. St. Philip and his followers eagerly listened to the reports coming back from the early missionaries in India, and at one point thought he might be called to go to the East himself. However, he consulted a wise contemplative monk he knew, who advised  "Rome is your India."  St. Philip did send various young men to St. Ignatius to try their vocations in the new order. St. Ignatius wryly remarked. " For the Society, Philip is like the church bell: he calls everyone else in, and stays outside himself ! " They were canonized at the same ceremony in 1622, along with St. Francis Xavier, St. Teresa of Avila, and St. Isidore the Farmer.   " Anima Christi, sanctifica me. Corpus Christi, salve me. Sanguis Christi, inebria me. Aqua lateris Christi, lava me. Passio Christi, conforta me. O bone Iesu, exaudi me. Intra tua vulnera absconde me. Ne permittas me separari a te. Ab hoste maligno defende me. In hora mortis meae voca me. Et iube me venire ad te, ut cum Sanctis tuis laudem te in saecula saeculorum. Amen ." - Attributed to St. Ignatius Loyola  Here is a somewhat free translation ... "Soul  of Christ, be my sanctification; Body of Christ, be my salvation; Blood of Christ, fill all my veins; Water of Christs side, wash out my stains; Passion of Christ, my comfort be; O good Jesu, listen to me; In thy wounds I fain would hide, Neer to be parted from Thy side; Guard me, should the foe assail me; Call me when my life shall fail me; Bid me come to Thee above, With Thy saints to sing Thy love, World without end. Amen."-  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    It is also the feast of  urlLink Blessed John Colombini  . The life of Blessed Colombini deeply moved St. Philip and was favorite reading for the first generation of Oratorians.

        From  The Idea of a University     by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  " Right Reason, that is, Reason rightly exercised, leads the mind to the Catholic Faith, and plants it there, and teaches it in all its religious speculations to act under its guidance. But Reason, considered as a real agent in the world, and as an operative principle in man's nature, with an historical course and with definite results, is far from taking so straight and satisfactory a direction. It considers itself from first to last independent and supreme; it requires no external authority; it makes a religion for itself. Even though it accepts Catholicism, it does not go to sleep; it has an action and development of its own, as the passions have, or the moral sentiments, or the principle of self-interest. Divine grace, to use the language of Theology, does not by its presence supersede nature; nor is nature at once brought into simple concurrence and coalition with grace. Nature pursues its course, now coincident with that of grace, now parallel to it, now across, now divergent, now counter, in proportion to its own imperfection and to the attraction and influence which grace exerts over it.

On Saturday I will be going on a Day of Recollection for Secular Oratorians out at  urlLink Rednal ,  urlLink the Pittsburgh Oratory's retreat house.   (Yes, it is named in honor of the Rednal which is the retreat house of the Birmingham Oratory.) On Sunday I will be heading to St. Mary's, Pennsylvania to watch my friend Clare become a Benedictine novice. Prayers for both trips, and for my friend, would be most welcome.   A quote, just because.    "The Incarnation is the most stupendous event which ever can take place on earth; and after it, and henceforth, I do not see how we can scruple at any miracle on the mere ground of its being unlikely to happen. No miracle can be so great as that which took place in the Holy House at Nazareth; it is indefinitely more difficult to believe than all the miracles of the Breviary, of the Martyrology, of Saints' lives, of legends, of local traditions, put together; and there is the grossest inconsistency, on the very face of the matter, for any one so to strain out the gnat, and to swallow the camel, as to profess what is inconceivable, yet to protest against what is surely within the limits of intelligible hypothesis. If, through divine grace, we once are able to accept the solemn truth that the Supreme Being was born of a mortal woman, what is there to be imagined which can offend us on the ground of its marvellousness? Thus, you see, it happens that, though First Principles are commonly assumed, not proved, ours in this case admits, if not of proof, yet of recommendation, by means of that fundamental truth which Protestants profess as well as we. When we start with assuming that miracles are not unlikely, we are putting forth a position which lies imbedded,  as it were, and involved in the great revealed fact of the Incarnation. "- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Lectures on the Present Position of Catholics in England   It is Day Five of the  urlLink  Novena for the Canonization of Venerable Newman.

        Perhaps it was inevitable...  but it is still terribly sad.   urlLink Gay Bishop Wins in Episcopal Vote, Threatening Split   .   I was slightly heartened to see that the local Episcopalian bishop had this to say : "This body willfully confirming the election of a person sexually active outside of holy matrimony has departed from the historic faith and order of the Church of Jesus Christ."- Robert Duncan, Episcopal Bishop of Pittsburgh.  There is commentary all over the Blogosphere, but I especially appreciate a post by the redoubtable Lane Core:  urlLink Suggested Reading for Episcopalians Troubled in Conscience    Mr. White posted some  urlLink  prayers for the intercession of Our Lady of Walsingham.    If any of my readers are in the situation referred to above, the following prayer may help:   Prayer for the Light of Truth   by Venerable John Henry Cardinal Newman, C.O.    I should like an enquirer to say continually:   O my God, I confess that  Thou canst  enlighten my darkness. I confess that Thou  alone  canst. I  wish  my darkness to be enlightened. I do not know whether Thou wilt: but that Thou canst and that I wish, are sufficient reasons for me to  ask , what Thou at least hast not forbidden my asking. I hereby promise that by Thy grace which I am asking, I will embrace whatever I at length feel certain is the truth, if ever I come to be certain. And by Thy grace I will guard against all self-deceit which may lead me to take what nature would have, rather than what reason approves. Amen.     The Venerable sadly predicted in 1864  that the Anglican Church, tied as it is to the nation, would eventually  urlLink  sink to the nation's level.    Here, the Episcopalians are not established, so instead they import American-style voting into doctrinal and moral issues- a procedure which seems to destroy respect for Scripture, Tradition, and morality even more quickly.

       Mr. White  has an interesting post, and  urlLink  an excellent suggestion.  Today is Day Four of the  urlLink  Venerable Newman Canonization Novena .  Also, if you can, tune in to EWTN Live ! on August 13th. The guest will be Fr. Paul Chavasse, C.O. Provost of the Birmingham Oratory and postulator of Oratorian Causes, speaking on the Venerable's life, his works, and the progress of his Cause for Beatification. ( I will be at a Secular Oratory meeting that evening, but   will  be taping the program.) I have met Fr. Chavasse and heard him speak- it ought to be good !

        From "Christ Upon the Waters", in    Sermons Preached on Various Occasions    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "He came to His disciples in the passage I have read to you, walking upon the sea,the emblem or hieroglyphic among the ancients of the impossible; to show them that what is impossible with man, is possible with God. He who could walk the waters, could also ride triumphantly upon what is still more fickle, unstable, tumultuous, treacherousthe billows of human wills, human purposes, human hearts. The bark of Peter was struggling with the waves, and made no progress; Christ came to him walking upon them; He entered the boat, and by entering it He sustained it. He did not abandon Himself to it, but He brought it near to Himself; He did not merely take refuge in it, but He made Himself the strength of it, and the pledge and cause of a successful passage. 'Presently,'another gospel says, 'the ship was at the land, whither they were going.'  Such was the power of the Son of God, the Saviour of man, manifested by visible tokens in the material world, when He came upon earth; and such, too, it has ever since signally shown itself to be, in the history of  that mystical ark which He then formed to float upon the ocean of human opinion. He told His chosen servants to form an ark for the salvation of souls: He gave them directions how to construct it,the length, breadth, and height, its cabins and its windows; and the world, as it gazed upon it, forthwith began to criticize. It pronounced it framed quite contrary to the scientific rules of shipbuilding; it prophesied, as it still prophesies, that such a craft was not sea-worthy; that it was not water-tight; that it would not float; that it would go to pieces and founder. And why it does not, who can say, except that the Lord is in it? Who can say why so old a framework, put together eighteen hundred years ago, should have lasted, against all human calculation, even to this day; always going, and never gone; ever failing, yet ever managing to explore new seas and foreign coastsexcept that He, who once said to the rowers, "It is I, be not afraid," and to the waters, 'Peace,' is still in His own ark which He has made, to direct and to prosper her course? "  If anyone is interested in joining in the Novena for the canonization of Venerable Newman, it is  urlLink  here.  Today is Day Three.

        From the homily   Actually, these quotes are from yesterday's homily. Fr. Bryan was the celebrant at noon Mass yesterday, and it was excellent. A few quotes.... (these are not exact, as I did not have a tape recorder at Mass.) " We might be astonished at the Israelites grumbling. After all, they had just been led out of slavery in Egypt, with God manifesting Himself in many miracles. However, we do the same thing.... Jesus suffered and died for us, and  He gave us the Eucharist, His Own Self in His Body and Blood, and we spend our time grumbling..." "Many people complain that the Church does not fit in with the current century, especially in her moral teachings. However, the current culture is on the road to Hell. I know I don't want to go there, and you probably don't either. " "The pollsters say that 50% of Catholics do not believe that Jesus is truly present in the Blessed Sacrament. Well, He is. It is not a mere sign or symbol; He is there. He said so. "

       No blogging until Monday  since I will be out of town for a wedding until then. Since I will not be able to blog tommorow, here is a little quote for the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.    Mary is the "Stella Matutina," the Morning Starafter the Dark Night, but always Heralding the Sun  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "What  is the nearest approach in the way of symbols, in this world of sight and sense, to represent to us the glories of that higher world which is beyond our bodily perceptions? What are the truest tokens and promises here, poor though they may be, of what one day we hope to see hereafter, as being beautiful and rare? Whatever they may be, surely the Blessed Mother of God may claim them as her own. And so it is; two of them are ascribed to her as her titles, in her Litanythe stars above, and flowers below. She is at once the  Rosa Mystica   and the  Stella Matutina .  And of these two, both of them well suited to her, the Morning Star becomes her best, and that for three reasons.  First, the rose belongs to this earth, but the star is placed in high heaven. Mary now has no part in this nether world. No change, no violence from fire, water, earth, or air, affects the stars above; and they show themselves, ever bright and marvellous, in all regions of this globe, and to all the tribes of men.  And next, the rose has but a short life; its decay is as sure as it was graceful and fragrant in its noon. But Mary, like the stars, abides for ever, as lustrous now as she was on the day of her Assumption; as pure and perfect, when her Son comes to judgment, as she is now.  Lastly, it is Mary's prerogative to be the  Morning  Star, which heralds in the sun. She does not shine for herself, or from herself, but she is the reflection of her and our Redeemer, and she glorifies Him. When she appears in the darkness, we know that He is close at hand. He is Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. Behold He comes quickly, and His reward is with Him, to render to everyone according to his works. 'Surely I come quickly. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.' " -   Meditations and Devotions

        From   The Idea of a University    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Right Reason, that is, Reason rightly exercised, leads the mind to the Catholic Faith, and plants it there, and teaches it in all its religious speculations to act under its guidance. But Reason, considered as a real agent in the world, and as an operative principle in man's nature, with an historical course and with definite results, is far from taking so straight and satisfactory a direction. It considers itself from first to last independent and supreme; it requires no external authority; it makes a religion for itself. Even though it accepts Catholicism, it does not go to sleep; it has an action and development of its own, as the passions have, or the moral sentiments, or the principle of self-interest. Divine grace, to use the language of Theology, does not by its presence supersede nature; nor is nature at once brought into simple concurrence and coalition with grace. Nature pursues its course, now coincident with that of grace, now parallel to it, now across, now divergent, now counter, in proportion to its own imperfection and to the attraction and influence which grace exerts over it. And what takes place as regards other principles of our nature and their developments is found also as regards the Reason. "

        Either somebody is getting Primary and Secondary Realities confused...  or else their spelling is really screwy. I noticed a new entry over at the infamous  urlLink  List o' Mini-Balrogs - apparently some poor soul out there is referring to a certain Elven lady as "Gabriel". Now I like elves a great deal, but angels they aren't, as anybody who has read  The Silmarillion  will tell you. it's probably just a bizarre typo, but still... weird....  And the misspellings of the Tolkienian names for the Deity continue to multiply:  Iluuvatar, Iluvitar, Iluvetar, Lluvatar, Illuvator, and Aru. If you are going to use the Eldarin names for God Almighty Himself- spell them correctly, please !

       Gerard Serafin  posted a  urlLink quote  yesterday from Venerable John Henry Newman's last sermon as an Anglican,  urlLink  The Parting of Friends  . While the paragraphs quoted are both beautiful and sad , I always found the final paragraph the most moving.  "And, O my brethren, O kind and affectionate hearts, O loving friends, should you know any one whose lot it has been, by writing or by word of mouth, in some degree to help you thus to act; if he has ever told you what you knew about yourselves, or what you did not know; has read to you your wants or feelings, and comforted you by the very reading; has made you feel that there was a higher life than this daily one, and a brighter world than that you see; or encouraged you, or sobered you, or opened a way to the inquiring, or soothed the perplexed; if what he has said or done has ever made you take interest in him, and feel well inclined towards him; remember such a one in time to come, though you hear him not, and pray for him, that in all things he may know God's will,  and at all times he may be ready to fulfil it."  It took the speaker two more years of anguish, during which he prayed, fasted, and eventually wrote himself out of his theological difficulties in  urlLink  An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine , before he found spiritual peace in the Catholic Church. And his life as a Catholic, while utterly satisfying from a spiritual perspective, was to be filled with difficulties and frustrations, many of them caused not by those outside the Catholic Church, but, alas, some within her fold-including some whom he himself had helped to lead home.

        On this date in 1890...  Venerable John Henry Cardinal Newman, C.O.,  went to his reward. He was eighty-nine years old, having been an Anglican for the first 44 years of his life and a Catholic for the other 45. Here is a description of his last few days: " In the summer of 1890 it was clear that the end was not far distant. Father Neville( ed. the Oratorian Father who assisted the Venerable in his declining years) records that the Cardinal was displeased with the doctors for speaking as though he might yet live a year or two when they must know that it was a matter of months or even weeks. Death did come almost suddenly. But it was immediately preceded by a somewhat remarkable momentary rally on the evening of August 9, which Father Neville thus records:  'The Cardinal entered his room ... his footstep was slow yet firm and elastic; indeed, it was not recognized as his, his attendant was surprised that it was he; soon, when seen, his bearing was in keeping with his step;unbent, erect to the full height of his best days in the 'fifties; he was without support of any kind. His whole carriage was, it may be said, soldier-like, and so dignified; and his countenance was most attractive to look at; even great age seemed to have gone from his face, and with it all careworn signs; his very look conveyed the cheerfulness and gratitude of his mind, and what he said was so kind; his voice was quite fresh and strong, his whole appearance was that of power, combined with complete calm.'   That night he was taken ill of congestion of the lungs. He rose next morning, but had to go to bed again. Then happened a little incident which brings before us vividly his clinging and grateful memory of those who had ministered by their kindness to his suffering temperament in days of trial. I relate it in Father Neville's own words:  'A poor, an indigent person, a stranger to him, had once left for him at the house door a silk handkerchief with a message of respect. This was very many years before he was Cardinal, and when he seemed, so to speak, much set aside; at a time, too, when he was himself very poor. Both present and message were received by him as they were meant, and with a solemn gravity which checked even a smile. He kept the handkerchief as something he prized. When he went to bed expecting to die, he had it brought to him, and put it on, and, though the doctors said he might as well be without it, he died with it on. He had kept it quite thirty years, even more.'  The Cardinal received the last Sacraments on August 10, and passed away at a quarter to nine in the evening of August 11, having been unconscious for most of the day. The funeral was at Rednal (ed. the Birmingham Oratory's retreat house) on the 19th. He was buried in accordance with the instructions he had left, in the grave of his beloved friend Ambrose St. John, and on the pall was his chosen motto 'Cor ad cor loquitur.' On the memorial slab at his own desire were engraved the words 'Ex umbris et imaginibus in veritatem.' "- Wilfred Ward,  Life of Cardinal Newman    As Msgr. Ronald Knox once noted, the words on that memorial slab, which Knox translates "Out of the shadows and images into truth", could be the epitaph for every Catholic.   Here is a link to  urlLink   his obituary in the  Times of London    , and one  to  urlLink  a collection of close to 200 obituaries published at the time of his death  . (What really amazed me was the existence of obituaries in   Rod and Gun  and   Horse and Hound  . I'm trying to picture   Field and Stream   doing an obit of an ecclesiastic.....)    Important as this day is, I must admit that I am hoping that when he is canonized another day is chosen as his feast. This is because, as I noted below, today is the feast of St. Clare of Assisi, and to put it bluntly, competing with the Franciscans is a terrible idea.     Here is the prayer for his canonization:   Eternal Father, You led JOHN HENRY NEWMAN to follow the kindly light of Truth, and he obediently responded to your heavenly calls at any cost. As writer, preacher, counsellor and educator, as pastor, Oratorian, and servant of the poor he laboured to build up Your Kingdom.  Grant that through your Vicar on Earth we may hear the words, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter into the company of the canonized saints."  May You manifest Your servant's power of intercession by even extraordinary answers to the prayers of the faithful throughout the world. We pray particularly for our intentions in his name and in the Name of Jesus Christ Your Son our Lord.  Amen.   Please report any favours received to: The Postulator, The Oratory, Hagley Road, Birmingham B16 8UE, England   Thanks to  urlLink  Lane Core  ,  urlLink Karen Marie Knapp , and anyone else who has mentioned this anniversary.   Finally, from the Venerable's own pen:   Prayer for a Happy Death  Oh, my Lord and Saviour, support me in that hour in the strong arms of Thy Sacraments, and by the fresh fragrance of Thy consolations. Let the absolving words be said over me, and the holy oil sign and seal me, and Thy own Body be my food, and Thy Blood my sprinkling; and let my sweet Mother, Mary, breathe on me, and my Angel whisper peace to me, and my glorious Saints ... smile upon me; that in them all, and through them all, I may receive the gift of perseverance, and die, as I desire to live, in Thy faith, in Thy Church, in Thy service, and in Thy love. Amen.

       For Saturday   Going After the Lost Sheep    by G.K. Chesterton     Our Lady went into a strange country,  Our Lady, for she was ours,  And had run on the little hills behind the houses  And pulled small flowers;  But she rose up and went into a strange country  With strange thrones and powers.    And there were giants in the land she walked in,   Tall as their toppling towns,  With heads so high in heaven, the constellations  Served them for crowns;  And their feet might have forded like a brook the abysses  Where Babel drowns.    They were girt about with the wings of morning and evening,   Furled and unfurled,  Round the speckled sky where our small spinning planet   Like a top is twirled;  And the swords they waived were the unending comets  That shall end the world.    And moving in innocence and in accident,   She turned the face  That none has ever looked on without loving    On the Lords of Space;  And one hailed her with her name in our country   That is full of grace.    Our Lady went into a strange country    And they crowned her queen,  For she needed never to be stayed or questioned   But only seen;  And they were broken down under unbearable beauty    As we have been.    But ever she walked till away in the last high places,       One great light shone  From the pillored throne of the King of all the country       Who sat thereon;  And she cried aloud as she cried under the gibbet       For she saw her Son.    Our Lady wears a crown in a strange country,       The crown He gave,  But she has not forgotten to call to her old companions       To call and to crave;  And to hear her calling a man might arise and thunder       On the doors of the grave.

        The Feast of St. Rose of Lima, Virgin  is today. There is information on her  urlLink  here.  .  "Even the most favoured of that glorious company, whom He has washed clean in His Blood; they never forget what they were by birth; they confess, one and all, that they are children of Adam, and of the same nature as their brethren, and compassed with infirmities while in the flesh, whatever may be the grace given them and their own improvement of it. Others may look up to them, but they ever look up to God; others may speak of their merits, but they only speak of their defects. The young and unspotted, the aged and most mature, he who has sinned least, he who has repented most, the fresh innocent brow, and the hoary head, they unite in this one litany, 'O God, be merciful to me, a sinner.' So it was with St. Aloysius; so, on the other hand, was it with St. Ignatius; so was it with St. Rose, the youngest of the saints, who, as a child, submitted her tender frame to the most amazing penances; so was it with St. Philip Neri, one of the most aged, who, when some one praised him, cried out, 'Begone! I am a devil, and not a saint;' and when going to communicate, would protest before his Lord, that he 'was good for nothing, but to do evil.' Such utter self-prostration, I say, is the very badge and token of the servant of Christ;and this indeed is conveyed in His own words, when He says, 'I am not come to call the just, but sinners;'and it is solemnly recognized and inculcated by Him, in the words which follow the text, 'Every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.'

        Blogging may be sporadic...  over the next few weeks, due to some developments in Real Life.  In case I don't get to blog for a bit, I leave a quote from the Venerable.... "If, then, a person asks how he is to know whether he is dreaming on in the world's slumber, or is really awake and alive unto God, let him first fix his mind upon some one or other of his besetting infirmities. Every one who is at all in the habit of examining himself, must be conscious of such within him. Many men have more than one, all of us have some one or other; and in resisting and overcoming such, self-denial has its first employment. One man is indolent and fond of amusement, another man is passionate or ill-tempered, another is vain, another has little control over his tongue; others are weak, and cannot resist the ridicule of thoughtless companions; others are tormented with bad passions, of which they are ashamed, yet are overcome. Now let every one consider what his weak point is; in that is his trial. His trial is not in those things which are easy to him, but in that one thing, in those several things, whatever they are, in which to do his duty is against his nature. Never think yourself safe because you do your duty in ninety-nine points; it is the hundredth which is to be the ground of your self-denial, which must evidence, or rather instance and realize your faith. It is in reference to this you must watch and pray; pray continually for God's grace to help you, and watch with fear and trembling lest you fall. "-  Parochial and Plain Sermons, Volume One  - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

       Written on August 18, 1855    The Mental Sufferings of Our Lord  by Venerable John Henry Newman. C.O.   1. After all His discourses were consummated (Matt. xxvi. 1), fully finished and brought to an end, then He said, The Son of man will be betrayed to crucifixion. As an army puts itself in battle array, as sailors, before an action, clear the decks, as dying men make their will and then turn to God, so though our Lord could never cease to speak good words, did He sum up and complete His teaching, and then commence His passion. Then He removed by His own act the prohibition which kept Satan from Him, and opened the door to the agitations of His human heart, as a soldier, who is to suffer death, may drop his handkerchief himself. At once Satan came on and seized upon his brief hour.  2. An evil temper of murmuring and criticism is spread among the disciples. One was the source of it, but it seems to have been spread. The thought of His death was before Him, and He was thinking of it and His burial after it. A woman came and anointed His sacred head. The action spread a soothing tender feeling over His pure soul. It was a mute token of sympathy, and the whole house was filled with it. It was rudely broken by the harsh voice of the traitor now for the first time giving utterance to his secret heartlessness and malice.  Ut quid perditio haec?  'To what purpose is this waste?'the unjust steward with his impious economy making up for his own private thefts by grudging honour to his Master. Thus in the midst of the sweet calm harmony of that feast at Bethany, there comes a jar and discord; all is wrong: sour discontent and distrust are spreading, for the devil is abroad.  3. Judas, having once shown what he was, lost no time in carrying out his malice. He went to the Chief Priests, and bargained with them to betray his Lord for a price. Our Lord saw all that took place within him; He saw Satan knocking at his heart, and admitted there and made an honoured and beloved guest and an intimate. He saw him go to the Priests and heard the conversation between them. He had seen it by His foreknowledge all the time he had been about Him, and when He chose him. What we know feebly as to be, affects us far more vividly and very differently when it actually takes place. Our Lord had at length felt, and suffered Himself to feel, the cruelty of the ingratitude of which He was the sport and victim. He had treated Judas as one of His most familiar friends. He had shown marks of the closest intimacy; He had made him the purse-keeper of Himself and His followers. He had given him the power of working miracles. He had admitted him to a knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. He had sent him out to preach and made him one of His own special representatives, so that the Master was judged of by the conduct of His servant. A heathen, when smitten by a friend, said, "Et tu Brutë!" What desolation is in the sense of ingratitude! God who is met with ingratitude daily cannot from His Nature feel it. He took a human heart, that He might feel it in its fulness. And now, O my God, though in heaven, dost Thou not feel my ingratitude towards Thee? "

        The wedding was beautiful...  but we kept getting lost down in the Baltimore area.  It seems as if everything in the section we were in (near Columbia) was hidden by trees, including signs for shopping centers and restaurants.   On the plus side, during our search for the church, we came across evidence that at least one Tolkien fan had been involved in planning the area. Somebody had named a subdivision "Hobbits Glen".  However, I did not spot any round doors, or even round windows.....   At the reception, each place at the table had a little package of sugared almonds, and a small scroll, which read:  " 'Charity of its nature opens out into a service that is universal; it inspires in us a commitment to practical and concrete love for every human being.'- Pope John Paul II  To Our Family and Friends  We have made a donation in your honor to Peter's Pence, the Holy Father's charitable fund.  This fund helps those around the world suffering as a result of war, oppression, or natural disasters.  We thank you for sharing with us the joy of our wedding day.

        For Saturday  "Now, as you know, it has been held from the first, and defined from an early age, that Mary is the Mother of God. She is not merely the Mother of our Lord's manhood, or of our Lord's body, but she is to be considered the Mother of the Word Himself, the Word incarnate. God, in the person of the Word, the Second Person of the All-glorious Trinity, humbled Himself to become her Son.  Non horruisti Virginis uterum , as the Church sings, 'Thou didst not disdain the Virgin's womb'. He took the substance of His human flesh from her, and clothed in it He lay within her; and He bore it about with Him after birth, as a sort of badge and witness that He, though God, was hers. He was nursed and tended by her; He was suckled by her; He lay in her arms. As time went on, He ministered to her, and obeyed her. He lived with her for thirty years, in one house, with an uninterrupted intercourse, and with only the saintly Joseph to share it with Him. She was the witness of His growth, of His joys, of His sorrows, of His prayers; she was blest with His smile, with the touch of His hand, with the whisper of His affection, with the expression of His thoughts and His feelings, for that length of time. Now, my brethren, what ought she to be, what is it becoming that she should be, who was so favoured? "- Venerable John Henry Newman. C.O.   Discourses to Mixed Congregations

       The Feast of Blessed Dominic Barberi, C.P., Priest  is also today. There is information on him  urlLink  here.  While he accomplished much in his mission to England, what he is best known for to many, and what especially endears him to me, is what happened on October 8, 1845. Fr. Dominic, en route to Belgium, had decided to call on John  Dalgairns, whom he had recently received into the Church. When Dalgairns met him, he informed the priest that he knew of someone else who wished to be received into the Church, out at Littlemore, a village near Oxford... someone for whom this step had been a long time in coming, but who was now, finally, sure....  The coach was late, and it was close to midnight when Fr. Dominic arrived at Littlemore, drenched from riding on top of the coach in the pouring rain. (It was cheaper than riding inside.) He stationed himself by the fire, and he himself recorded what happened next in a letter to his superiors: "The door opened- and what a spectacle it was for me to see at my feet John Henry Newman begging me to hear his confession and admit him to the bosom of the Catholic Church ! And there by the fire he began his general confession with extraordinary humility and devotion. "   It was so very late that Newman's general confession was partly heard that night, and partly the next day. He was reconciled with the Catholic Church, at Fr. Dominic's hands, the next day, October 9. 1845.

       The Power of the Cross  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "1. My God, who could have imagined, by any light of nature, that it was one of Thy attributes to lower Thyself, and to work out Thy purposes by Thy own humiliation and suffering? Thou hadst lived from eternity in ineffable blessedness. My God, I might have understood as much as this, viz. that, when Thou didst begin to create and surround Thyself with a world of creatures, that these attributes would show themselves in Thee which before had no exercise. Thou couldest not show Thy power when there was nothing whatever to exercise it. Then too, Thou didst begin to show thy wonderful and tender providence, Thy faithfulness, Thy solicitous care for those whom Thou hadst created. But who could have fancied that Thy creation of the universe implied and involved in it Thy humiliation? O my great God, Thou hast humbled Thyself, Thou hast stooped to take our flesh and blood, and hast been lifted up upon the tree! I praise and glorify Thee tenfold the more, because Thou hast shown Thy power by means of Thy suffering, than hadst Thou carried on Thy work without it. It is worthy of Thy infinitude thus to surpass and transcend all our thoughts.   2. O my Lord Jesu, I believe, and by Thy grace will ever believe and hold, and I know that it is true, and will be true to the end of the world, that nothing great is done without suffering, without humiliation, and that all things are possible by means of it. I believe, O my God, that poverty is better than riches, pain better than pleasure, obscurity and contempt than name, and ignominy and reproach than honour. My Lord, I do not ask Thee to bring these trials on me, for I know not if I could face them; but at least, O Lord, whether I be in prosperity or adversity, I will believe that it is as I have said. I will never have faith in riches, rank, power, or reputation. I will never set my heart on worldly success or on worldly advantages. I will never wish for what men call the prizes of life. I will ever, with Thy grace, make much of those who are despised or neglected, honour the poor, revere the suffering, and admire and venerate Thy saints and confessors, and take my part with them in spite of the world.  3. And lastly, O my dear Lord, though I am so very weak that I am not fit to ask Thee for suffering as a gift, and have not strength to do so, at least I will beg of Thee grace to meet suffering well, when Thou in Thy love and wisdom dost bring it upon me. Let me bear pain, reproach, disappointment, slander, anxiety, suspense, as Thou wouldest have me, O my Jesu, and as Thou by Thy own suffering hast taught me, when it comes. And I promise too, with Thy grace, that I will never set myself up, never seek pre-eminence, never court any great thing of the world, never prefer myself to others. I wish to bear insult meekly, and to return good for evil. I wish to humble myself in all things, and to be silent when I am ill-used, and to be patient when sorrow or pain is prolonged, and all for the love of Thee, and Thy Cross, knowing that in this way I shall gain the promise both of this life and of the next.

        For Saturday   Ave Maris Stella  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  " Hail, Star of the Sea  Truly art thou a star, O Mary! Our Lord indeed Himself, Jesus Christ, He is the truest and chiefest Star, the bright and morning Star, as St. John calls Him; that Star which was foretold from the beginning as destined to rise out of Israel, and which was displayed in figure by the star which appeared to the wise men in the East. But if the wise and learned and they who teach men in justice shall shine as stars for ever and ever; if the angels of the Churches are called stars in the Hand of Christ; if He honoured the apostles even in the days of their flesh by a title, calling them lights of the world; if even those angels who fell from heaven are called by the beloved disciple stars; if lastly all the saints in bliss are called stars, in that they are like stars differing from stars in glory; therefore most assuredly, without any derogation from the honour of our Lord, is Mary His mother called the Star of the Sea, and the more so because even on her head she wears a crown of twelve stars. Jesus is the Light of the world, illuminating every man who cometh into it, opening our eyes with the gift of faith, making souls luminous by His Almighty grace; and Mary is the Star, shining with the light of Jesus, fair as the moon, and special as the sun, the star of the heavens, which it is good to look upon, the star of the sea, which is welcome to the tempest-tossed, at whose smile the evil spirit flies, the passions are hushed, and peace is poured upon the soul.  Hail then, Star of the Sea, we joy in the recollection of thee. Pray for us ever at the throne of Grace; plead our cause, pray with us, present our prayers to thy Son and Lordnow and in the hour of death, Mary be thou our help. "

        For Friday  " Well, my brethren, your God has taken on Him your nature, and now prepare yourself to see in human flesh that glory and that beauty on which the Angels gaze. Since you are to see Emmanuel, since 'the brilliancy of the Eternal Light and the unspotted mirror of God's majesty, and the Image of His goodness,' is to walk the earth, since the Son of the Highest is to be born of woman, since the manifold attributes of the Infinite are to be poured out before your eyes through material channels and the operations of a human soul, since He, whose contemplation did but trouble you in Nature, is coming to take you captive by a manifestation, which is both intelligible to you and a pledge that He loves you one by one, raise high your expectations, for surely they cannot suffer disappointment. Doubtless, you will say, He will take a form such as 'eye hath not seen, nor ear heard of ' before. It will be a body framed in the heavens, and only committed to the custody of Mary; a form of light and glory, worthy of Him, who is "blessed for evermore," and comes to bless us with His presence. Pomp and pride of men He may indeed despise; we do not look for Him in kings' courts, or in the array of war, or in the philosophic school; but doubtless He will choose some calm and holy spot, and men will go out thither and find their Incarnate God. He will be tenant of some paradise, like Adam or Elias, or He will dwell in the mystic garden of the Canticles, where nature ministers its best and purest to its Creator. 'The fig-tree will put forth her green figs, the vines in flower yield their sweet smell;' 'spikenard and saffron'will be there; 'the sweet cane and cinnamon, myrrh and aloes, with all the chief perfumes;' 'the glory of Libanus, the beauty of Carmel,' before 'the glory of the Lord and the beauty of our God'. There will He show Himself at stated times, with Angels for His choristers and saints for His doorkeepers, to the poor and needy, to the humble and devout, to those who have kept their innocence undefiled, or have purged their sins away by long penance and masterful contrition.  Such would be the conjecture of man, at fault when he speculated on the height of God, and now again at fault when he tries to sound the depth. He thinks that a royal glory is the note of His presence upon earth; lift up your eyes, my brethren, and answer whether he has guessed aright. Oh, incomprehensible in eternity and in time! solitary in heaven, and solitary upon earth! 'Who is this, that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozra? Why is Thy apparel red, and Thy garments like theirs that tread in the wine press?' It is because the Maker of man, the Wisdom of God, has come, not in strength, but in weakness. He has come, not to assert a claim, but to pay a debt. Instead of wealth, He has come poor; instead of honour, He has come in ignominy; instead of blessedness, He has come to suffer. He has been delivered over from His birth to pain and contempt; His delicate frame is worn down by cold and heat, by hunger and sleeplessness; His hands are rough and bruised with a mechanic's toil; His eyes are dimmed with weeping; His Name is cast out as evil. He is flung amid the throng of men; He wanders from place to place; He is the companion of sinners. He is followed by a mixed multitude, who care more for meat and drink than for His teaching, or by a city's populace which deserts Him in the day of trial. And at length 'the Brightness of God's Glory and the Image of His Substance' is fettered, haled to and fro, buffeted, spit upon, mocked, cursed, scourged, and tortured. 'He hath no beauty nor comeliness; He is despised and the most abject of men, a Man of sorrows and acquainted with infirmity;' nay, He is a 'leper, and smitten of God, and afflicted'. And so His clothes are torn off, and He is lifted up upon the bitter Cross, and there He hangs, a spectacle for profane, impure, and savage eyes, and a mockery for the evil spirit whom He had cast down into hell.  Oh, wayward man! discontented first that thy God is far from thee, discontented again when He has drawn near,complaining first that He is high, complaining next that He is low!unhumbled being, when wilt thou cease to make thyself thine own centre, and learn that God is infinite in all He does, infinite when He reigns in heaven, infinite when He serves on earth, exacting our homage in the midst of His Angels, and winning homage from us in the midst of sinners? Adorable He is in His eternal rest, adorable in the glory of His court, adorable in the beauty of His works, most adorable of all, most royal, most persuasive in His deformity. Think you not, my brethren, that to Mary, when she held Him in her maternal arms, when she gazed on the pale countenance and the dislocated limbs of her God, when she traced the wandering lines of blood, when she counted the weals, the bruises, and the wounds, which dishonoured that virginal flesh, think you not that to her eyes it was more beautiful than when she first worshipped it, pure, radiant, and fragrant, on the night of His nativity?

       I've felt for a long time  that a certain 'singer' is being influenced by the Enemy to sully the Catholic Faith, particularly things connected with Our Lady whom he hates so deeply since she was God's means of coming to us and saving us. The fact that this 'musician' is now not only indulging in pseudo-lesbianism on stage but  urlLink is using her innocent daughter to further mock Catholicism  is further evidence to feed my suspicions. When the words "Madonna" and "Lourdes" call to mind not our loving Mother who gave birth to the Savior, but a mother who exploits her own child for shock value, it's a sign of how depraved we've become. May the true Madonna, Our Lady of Lourdes, intercede for this woman and her children.   Link courtesy of  urlLink  Mark Shea.

       Intercession of the Saints   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "While Moses on the Mountain lay,  Night after night, and day by day,  Till forty suns were gone,  Unconscious, in the Presence bright,  Of lustrous day and starry night,  As though his soul had flitted quite  From earth, and Eden won;   The pageant of a kingdom vast,  And things unutterable, pass'd  Before the Prophet's eye;  Dread shadows of th' Eternal Throne,  The fount of Life, and Altar-stone,  Pavement, and them that tread thereon,  And those who worship nigh.    But lest he should his own forget,  Who in the vale were struggling yet,   A sadder vision came,  Announcing all that guilty deed  Of idol rite, that in their need  He for his flock might intercede,  And stay Heaven's rising flame.

        From    The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien    An excerpt from a letter , dated September, 1995, in reply to a reader who took exception to the archaism of some of the language in   The Two Towers ....  "Take an example from the chapter that you specially singled out (and called terrible) : Book iii, 'The King of the Golden Hall'.  ' "Nay, Gandalf !" said the King. "You do not know your own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front of the battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better. " '  That is a fair sample- moderated or watered archaism. Using only words that are still used or known to the educated, the King would really have said: ' Nay, thou (n)wost not thine own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall...' etc. I know well enough what a modern would say. ' Not at all, my dear G. You don't know your own skill as a doctor. Things aren't going to be like that. I shall go to the war, in person, even if I have to be one of the first casualities. ' and then what ? Th&eacute;oden would certainly think, and probably say, 'thus shall I sleep better !' But people who think like that just do not talk a modern idiom. You can have 'I shall lie easier in my grave' or 'I should sleep sounder in my grave like that rather than if I stayed at home' - if you like. But there would be an insincerity of thought, a disunion of word and meaning. For a King who spoke a modern idiom would not really think in such terms at all, and any reference to sleeping quietly in the grave would be a deliberate archaism on his part (however worded) far more bogus than the actual 'archaic' English that I have used. "  And from the same letter.... "I am sorry to find  you  affected by the extraordinary 20th C. delusion its usages  per se  and simply as 'contemporary'- irrespective of whether they are terser, more vivid ( or even nobler !)- have some peculiar validity above those of all other times, so that not to use them (even when quite unsuitable in tone) is a solecism, a gaffe, a thing at which one's friends shudder or feel hot in the collar. Shake yourself out of this parochialism of time ! Also (not to be too donnish about it) learn to distinguish between the bogus and the genuine antique- as you would if you hoped not to be cheated by a dealer ! "

        The Feast of Pope St. Gregory the Great, Doctor of the Church  is today. There is information on him  urlLink  here . Prayers for the Holy Father and all those who have St. Gregory as a special patron would be appropriate, as well as prayers for the more widespread use of Gregorian chant in the liturgy.    "One would have thought that in the age of St. Gregory, a Pope had enough to do in living on from day to day, without troubling himself about the future; that, with the Lombard at his doors, he would not have had spirit to set about converting the English; and that, if he was anxious about the preservation of learning, he would have looked elsewhere than to the Isles of the North, for its refuge in the evil day. Why, I repeat, was it not easier, safer, and more feasible for him to have made much of the prosperous, secure, and long established schools of Alexandria, when the enemy went about him plundering and burning? He was not indeed on the best terms with Constantinople; Antioch was exposed to other enemies, and had suffered from them already; but Alexandria was not only learned and protected, but was a special ally of the Holy See; yet Alexandria was put aside for England and Ireland.  With what pertinacity of zeal does Gregory send his missionaries to England! with what an appetite he waits for the tidings of their progress! with what a relish he dwells over the good news, when they are able to send it! He wrote back to Augustine in words of triumph:' "Gloria in excelsis Deo," 'he says, ' "et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis!' for the Grain of corn died and was buried in the earth, that It might reign with a great company in Heaven,by whose death we live, by whose weakness we are strengthened, by whose sufferings we escape suffering, by whose love we are seeking in Britain brothers whom we know not of, by whose gift we find those whom, not knowing, we were seeking. Who can describe the joy, which was caused in the hearts of all the faithful here, on the news that the English nation, by the operation of the grace of the Omnipotent God, and by your labours, my brother, had been rescued from the shades of error and overspread with the light of holy faith! If on one penitent there is great joy in heaven, what, think we, does it become, when a whole people has turned from its error, and has betaken itself to faith, and condemned the evil it has done by repenting of the doing! Wherefore in this joy of Heaven and Angels, let me say once more the very Angels' words, "Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis." '  What were these outer barbarians to Gregory? how could they relieve him or profit him? What compensation could they make for what the Church was then losing, or might lose in future? Yet he corresponds with their king and queen, urges them to complete what they had so happily begun, reminds Bertha of St. Helena, and what St. Helena did for the Romans, and Ethelbert, of the great Constantine; informs them of the satisfaction which their conversion had given to the Imperial Court at Constantinople, and sends them sacred presents from the Apostle Peter. Nay he cannot keep from talking of these savages, apropos of anything whatever, for they have been running in his head from the day he first saw them in the slave market; and he makes the learned Church of Alexandria the special partner of his joy upon this contemptible victory. The Patriarch Eulogius had been telling him of his own success in reclaiming the heretics of Alexandria, and he sends him a piece of good news in return:'As I am well aware," he says, "that in the midst of your own good deeds, you rejoice in those of others, I will repay you for the kindness of your tidings by telling you something of the same sort.' And then he goes on to speak of the conversion of the English, 'who are situated in a corner of the world,' as if their gain was comparable to that of the educated and wealthy persons whom Eulogius had been reconciling to the Church. Nay, lest he should take too much credit for his own success, and grow vain upon it, he attributes it to the prayers of the Alexandrians, or at least of their Bishop, all that way off, as if the Angles and Jutes were anything at all to the city of the Ptolemies! 'On Christmas Day,' he says, 'more than 10,000 of them were baptized. I tell you of it, that you may know, that, while your words avail for your own people, your prayers avail for the ends of the earth. For you are by prayer where you are not, while you manifest yourself by holy labours where you are.'" -  The Rise and Progress of Universities - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

        From the Sermon "Preparation for the Judgement"  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "That indeed will be emphatically our evening, when the long day of life is over and eternity is at hand. Man goeth forth to his work and to his labour until the evening, and then the night cometh when no man can work. There is something inexpressibly solemn and subduing in that time, when work is done and judgement is coming. O my brethren, we must each of us in his turn, sooner or later, arrive at that hour. Each of us must come to the evening of life. Each of us must enter on eternity. Each of us must come to that quiet, awful time, when we appear before the Lord of the Vineyard, and answer for the deeds done in the body, whether they be good or bad. That, my dear brethren, you will have to undergo. Every one of you must undergo the particular judgement, and it will be the stillest, awfullest time which you ever can experience. It will be the dread moment of expectation, when your fate for eternity is in the balance, and when you are about to be sent forth the companion of saints or devils without possibility of change. There can be no change, there can be no reversal. As that judgement decides it, so it will be for ever and ever. Such is the particular judgement. The general judgement at the end of the world will be a time of dreadful publicity, and will be full of the terrible brightness of the Judge. The trump of the Archangel will sound, and the Lord will descend from heaven in lightning. The graves will open. The sun and the moon will be darkened and this earth will pass away. This is not the time of evening, but rather it will be a tempest in the midst of the night. But the parable in the Gospel speaks of the time of evening, and by the evening is meant, not the end of the world, but the time of death. And really perhaps it will be as awful, though very different, that solitary judgement, when the soul stands before its Maker, to answer for itself. O who can tell which judgement is the more terrible, the silent secret judgement, or the open glorious coming of the Judge. It will be most terrible certainly, and it comes first, to find ourselves by ourselves, one by one, in His presence, and to have brought before us most vividly all the thoughts, words and deeds of this past life. Who will be able to bear the sight of himself? And yet we shall be obliged steadily to confront ourselves and to see ourselves. In this life we shrink from knowing our real selves. We do not like to know how sinful we are. We love those who prophesy smooth things to us, and we are angry with those who tell us of our faults. But then, not one fault only, but all the secret, as well as evident, defects of our character will be clearly brought out. We shall see what we feared to see here, and much more. And then, when the full sight of ourselves comes to us, who will not wish that he had known more of himself here, rather than leaving it for the inevitable day to reveal it all to him!"

       On August 31, 1843....  Venerable Newman wrote this letter to his sister, after she had written to him, protesting his decision to leave his position as a Anglican clergyman.   "I am sorry to put you to such pain. Your letter and 's to you, would have brought me to many tears unless I had so hard a heart. You must take what I do in faith at least; if not, I fear I cannot find a better way of consoling you.  I wonder my late letters have not prepared you for this. Have you realised that three years since I wished to do it; and that I have said so in print, and that then only a friend prevented me?  It has been determined on since Lent. All through Lent I and another kept it in mind; and then, for safety, I said I would not act till October, though we both came to one view. October is coming! (ed. He had resolved that his final days as Vicar of St. Mary's would be in October.)    No  time is ' the ' time. You may have thought as you read, 'three years ago it would not have mattered.' Will three years hence be easier? The question is,  Ought  it to be done?  I mention a great secret, because I do not wish others to share in the responsibility; but I will say this, that I have always said, 'I cannot go wrong when A [Keble] and B [Rogers] agree that I should do a thing.' These two men agree in  this . I have not persuaded them.  I wrote to one of them the other day, whether I should assign some reasons. He answered to this effect: 'No one who knows the history of No. 90 can be surprised at it. Anyone but you would have taken the step before.'  My dearest Jemima, my circumstances are not of my making. One's duty is to act  under  circumstances. Is it a light thing to give up Littlemore? Am I not providing dreariness for myself? If others, whom I am pierced to think about, because I cannot help them, suffer, shall not I suffer in my own way?  Everything that one does honestly, sincerely, with prayer, with advice, must turn to good. In what am I not likely to be as good a judge as another? In the consequences? True, but is not this what I have been ever protesting against? the going by expedience, not by principle? My sweetest Jemima, of whom I am quite unworthy, rather pray that I may be directed aright, rather pray that something may occur to hinder me if I am wrong, than take the matter into your own hands.

        I'm always happy to find someone..  who appreciates  urlLink   The Silmarillion    Here's my favorite   Silmarillion   quote: " Thus in after days, what by the voyages of ships, what by lore and star-craft, the kings of Men knew that the world was indeed made round, and yet the Eldar were permitted still to depart and to come to the Ancient West and to Avall&oacute;në , if they would. Therefore the loremasters of Men said that a Straight Road must still be, for those that were permitted to find it. And they taught that, while the new world fell away, the old road and the path of the memory of the West still went on, as it were a mighty bridge invisible that passed through the air of breath and flight (which now were bent as the world was bent) and traversed Ilmen which flesh unaided cannot endure, until it came to Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle, and maybe even beyond, to Valinor, where the Valar still dwell and watch the unfolding of the story of the world. And tales and rumours arose along the shores of the sea concerning mariners and men forlorn upon the water who, by some fate or grace or favour of the Valar, had entered in upon the Straight Way and saw the face of the world sink beneath them, and so had come to the lamplit quays of Avall&oacute;në , or verily to the last beaches on the margins of Aman, and there had looked upon the White Mountain, dreadful and beautiful, before they died.

        From the homily  Fr. David was the celebrant at the 10 am mass today. The part of the homily I remember best was the point that while Our Lord in the Gospel had to stress that one cannot be defiled by what goes into our bodies, but what comes out of our hearts, today many of us are under the even worse ( I believe he used the word 'diabolical' ) delusion that   nothing  defiles us. He then proceeded to go through the list given in the Gospel, and our current sugarcoatings for them. "Unchastity is a 'lifestyle'. Greed is ' planning for retirement'. Murder is 'reproductive freedom' and 'compassion for the terminally ill.' The most deadly sins of all, pride and arrogance, hide under the label 'self-esteem'. "

        For Saturday    Our Lord and Our Lady   by Hilaire Belloc  "They warned Our Lady for the Child  That was Our Blessed Lord,  And she took Him into the desert wild,  Over the camel's ford.   And a long song she sang to Him  And a short story told:  And she wrapped Him in a woollen cloak  To keep Him from the cold.   But when Our Lord was grown a man  The Rich they dragged Him down,  And they crucified Him in Golgotha,  Out and beyond the Town.   They crucified Him on Calvary,  Upon an April day;  And because He had been her little Son  She followed Him all the way.   Our Lady stood beside the Cross,  A little space apart,  And when she heard Our Lord cry out  A sword went through her heart.   They laid Our Lord in a marble tomb,  Dead, in a winding sheet.  But Our Lady stands above the world  With the white Moon at her feet. "

        Apparently I jumped the gun a bit...  It seems the new Congregation of the Oratory in Seville-Blanco Paloma, Spain, is being officially established today. I thought it had happened a while ago. That's one of the troubles with the official Confederation website only being available in Italian- it leads to confusion for those whose Italian is weak-to-nonexistent, like me... sigh... Well, anyway,  congratuations to the Fathers and Brothers of the new Congregation. Prayers for them, and for vocations to all Congregations of the Oratory, would be most welcome.

I find his story particularly moving in that it recapitulated that of Our Lord so closely- the fact that he was betrayed by a man he had been teaching for thirty  tael  ( silver pieces) is perhaps the parallel that struck me most forcibly.

        From  Sermons Preached on Various Occasions   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Now in order to show what this good will, or good disposition is, and how it bears upon faith, I observe as follows: What is the main guide of the soul, given to the whole race of Adam, outside the true fold of Christ as well as within it, given from the first dawn of reason, given to it in spite of that grievous penalty of ignorance, which is one of the chief miseries of our fallen state? It is the light of conscience, 'the true Light,' as the same Evangelist says, in the same passage, 'which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world.' Whether a man be born in pagan darkness, or in some corruption of revealed religion,whether he has heard the name of the Saviour of the world or not, whether he be the slave of some superstition, or is in possession of some portions of Scripture, and treats the inspired word as a sort of philosophical book, which he interprets for himself, and comes to certain conclusions about its teaching,in any case, he has within his breast a certain commanding dictate, not a mere sentiment, not a mere opinion, or impression, or view of things, but a law, an authoritative voice, bidding him do certain things and avoid others. I do not say that its particular injunctions are always clear, or that they are always consistent with each other; but what I am insisting on here is this, that it  commands ,that it praises, it blames, it promises, it threatens, it implies a future, and it witnesses the unseen. It is more than a man's own self. The man himself has not power over it, or only with extreme difficulty; he did not make it, he cannot destroy it. He may silence it in particular cases or directions, he may distort its enunciations, but he cannot, or it is quite the exception if he can, he cannot emancipate himself from it. He can disobey it, he may refuse to use it; but it remains.  This is Conscience; and, from the nature of the case, its very existence carries on our minds to a Being exterior to ourselves; for else whence did it come? and to a Being superior to ourselves; else whence its strange, troublesome peremptoriness? I say, without going on to the question   what   it says, and whether its particular dictates are always as clear and consistent as they might be, its very existence throws us out of ourselves, and beyond ourselves, to go and seek for Him in the height and depth, whose Voice it is. As the sunshine implies that the sun is in the heavens, though we may see it not, as a knocking at our doors at night implies the presence of one outside in the dark who asks for admittance, so this Word within us, not only instructs us up to a certain point, but necessarily raises our minds to the idea of a Teacher, an unseen Teacher: and in proportion as we listen to that Word, and use it, not only do we learn more from it, not only do its dictates become clearer, and at its lessons broader, and its principles more consistent, but its very tone is louder and more authoritative and constraining. And thus it is, that to those who use what they have, more is given; for, beginning with obedience, they go on to the intimate perception and belief of one God. His voice within them witnesses to Him, and they believe His own witness about Himself. They believe in His existence, not because others say it, not in the word of man merely, but with a personal apprehension of its truth. This, then, is the first step in those good dispositions which lead to faith in the Gospel. "

        From  The Idea of a University    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Another reason of a kindred nature is to be found in the difference of method by which truths are gained  in theology and in physical science. Induction is the instrument of Physics, and deduction only is the instrument of Theology. There the simple question is, What is revealed? all doctrinal knowledge flows from one fountain head. If we are able to enlarge our view and multiply our propositions, it must be merely by the comparison and adjustment of the original truths; if we would solve new questions, it must be by consulting old answers. The notion of doctrinal knowledge absolutely novel, and of simple addition from without, is intolerable to Catholic ears, and never was entertained by any one who was even approaching to an understanding of our creed. Revelation is all in all in doctrine; the Apostles its sole depository, the inferential method its sole instrument, and ecclesiastical authority its sole sanction. The Divine Voice has spoken once for all, and the only question is about its meaning. Now this process, as far as it was reasoning, was the very mode of reasoning which, as regards physical knowledge, the school of Bacon has superseded by the inductive method:no wonder, then, that that school should be irritated and indignant to find that a subject-matter remains still, in which their favourite instrument has no office; no wonder that they rise up against this memorial of an antiquated system, as an eyesore and an insult; and no wonder that the very force and dazzling success of their own method in its own departments should sway or bias unduly the religious sentiments of any persons who come under its influence. They assert that no new truth can be gained by deduction; Catholics assent, but add that, as regards religious truth, they have not to seek at all, for they have it already. Christian Truth is purely of revelation; that revelation we can but explain, we cannot increase, except relatively to our own apprehensions; without it we should have known nothing of its contents, with it we know just as much as its contents, and nothing more. And, as it was given by a divine act independent of man, so will it remain in spite of man. Niebuhr may revolutionize history, Lavoisier chemistry, Newton astronomy; but God Himself is the author as well as the subject of theology. When Truth can change, its Revelation can change; when human reason can outreason the Omniscient, then may it supersede His work.  Avowals such as these fall strange upon the ear of men whose first principle is the search after truth, and whose starting-points of search are things material and sensible. They scorn any process of inquiry not founded on experiment; the Mathematics indeed they endure, because that science deals with ideas, not with facts, and leads to conclusions hypothetical rather than real; 'Metaphysics' they even use as a by-word of reproach; and Ethics they admit only on condition that it gives up conscience as its scientific ground, and bases itself on tangible utility: but as to Theology, they cannot deal with it, they cannot master it, and so they simply outlaw it and ignore it. Catholicism, forsooth, 'confines the intellect,' because it holds that God's intellect is greater than theirs, and that what He has done, man cannot improve. And what in some sort justifies them to themselves in this extravagance is the circumstance that there is a religion close at their doors which, discarding so severe a tone, has actually adopted their own principle of inquiry. Protestantism treats Scripture just as they deal with Nature; it takes the sacred text as a large collection of phenomena, from which, by an inductive process, each individual Christian may arrive at just those religious conclusions which approve themselves to his own judgment. It considers faith a mere modification of reason, as being an acquiescence in certain probable conclusions till better are found. Sympathy, then, if no other reason, throws experimental philosophers into alliance with the enemies of Catholicism. "

        Gerard Serafin   urlLink  reminds   us that it is the anniversary of a difficult day in the life of the Venerable- September 8, 1843, the day he officially tendered his resignation from ministry in the Church of England. ( He continued to function as an Anglican clergyman for a short while afterward, preaching his last sermon in late September and conducting his last service in early October.)    He wrote this letter to his sister Harriett soon afterwards, to attempt to deal with her distress over his resignation.    REV. J. H. NEWMAN TO MRS. THOMAS MOZLEY   September 29, 1843. " I do so despair of the Church of England, and am so evidently cast off by her, and, on the other hand, I am so drawn to the Church of Rome, that I think it  safer , as a matter of honesty,  not  to keep my living.   This is a very different thing from having any  intention  of joining the Church of Rome. However, to avow generally as much as I have said would be wrong for ten thousand reasons. People cannot understand a man being in a state of  doubt , of  misgiving , of being unequal to  responsibilities , &c.; but they will conclude that he has clear views either one way or the other. All I know is, that I could not without hypocrisy profess myself any longer a  teacher  and a  champion  for our Church.  Very few persons know this - hardly one person, only one (I think) in Oxford, viz. James Mozley. I think it would be most cruel, most unkind, most unsettling to tell them.  My dear Harriett, you must learn patience, so must we all, and resignation to the will of God. "  It was another two full years before he came into the Catholic Church, and when that finally happened, it exacerbated his difficulties with his family rather than making things easier. While his relationships with his brothers had been strained for quite a while and his entering the Catholic Church did not affect them much, his sisters were deeply troubled. Harriett never spoke to him again. Jemima continued to write sporadically, and visited the Oratory a few times, but her husband, who had been a good friend of Newman's, refused to come, and they both would not let him have any contact whatsoever with their children. After the success of the   Apologia Pro Vita Sua , Jemima's sons, now adults, turned up at the Birmingham Oratory to visit their famous uncle, whom they had not known at all as boys. On the day before the Venerable's death in 1890, Harriett's daughter visited him. The ancient Cardinal recalled that the last time he had seen her, she had been three years old. She was fifty.

        The Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary  is today. There is information on it  urlLink  here.   Mary is the "Rosa Mystica," the Mystical Rose  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    "How did Mary become the  Rosa Mystica , the choice, delicate, perfect flower of God's spiritual creation? It was by being born, nurtured and sheltered in the mystical garden or Paradise of God. Scripture makes use of the figure of a garden, when it would speak of heaven and its blessed inhabitants. A garden is a spot of ground set apart for trees and plants, all good, all various, for things that are sweet to the taste or fragrant in scent, or beautiful to look upon, or useful for nourishment; and accordingly in its spiritual sense it means the home of blessed spirits and holy souls dwelling there together, souls with both the flowers and the fruits upon them, which by the careful husbandry of God they have come to bear, flowers and fruits of grace, flowers more beautiful and more fragrant than those of any garden, fruits more delicious and exquisite than can be matured by earthly husbandman.  All that God has made speaks of its Maker; the mountains speak of His eternity; the sun of His immensity, and the winds of His Almightiness. In like manner flowers and fruits speak of His sanctity, His love, and His providence; and such as are flowers and fruits, such must be the place where they are found. That is to say, since they are found in a garden, therefore a garden has also excellences which speak of God, because it is their home. For instance, it would be out of place if we found beautiful flowers on the mountain-crag, or rich fruit in the sandy desert. As then by flowers and fruits are meant, in a mystical sense, the gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, so by a garden is meant mystically a place of spiritual repose, stillness, peace, refreshment, and delight.  Thus our first parents were placed in 'a garden of pleasure' shaded by trees, 'fair to behold and pleasant to eat of,' with the Tree of Life in the midst, and a river to water the ground. Thus our Lord, speaking from the cross to the penitent robber, calls the blessed place, the heaven to which He was taking him, "paradise," or a garden of pleasure. Therefore St. John, in the Apocalypse, speaks of heaven, the palace of God, as a garden or paradise, in which was the Tree of Life giving forth its fruits every month.  Such was the garden in which the Mystical Rose, the Immaculate Mary, was sheltered and nursed to be the Mother of the All Holy God, from her birth to her espousals to St. Joseph, a term of thirteen years. For three years of it she was in the arms of her holy mother, St. Anne, and then for ten years she lived in the temple of God. In those blessed gardens, as they may be called, she lived by herself, continually visited by the dew of God's grace, and growing up a more and more heavenly flower, till at the end of that period she was meet for the inhabitation in her of the Most Holy. This was the outcome of the Immaculate Conception. Excepting her, the fairest rose in the paradise of God has had upon it blight, and has had the risk of canker-worm and locust. All but Mary; she from the first was perfect in her sweetness and her beautifulness, and at length when the angel Gabriel had to come to her, he found her 'full of grace,' which had, from her good use of it, accumulated in her from the first moment of her being." -  Meditations and Devotions

        From   Discourses to Mixed Congregations    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "The truth is, that the world, knowing nothing of the blessings of the Catholic faith, and prophesying nothing but ill concerning it, fancies that a convert, after the first fervour is over, feels nothing but disappointment, weariness, and offence in his new religion, and is secretly desirous of retracing his steps. This is at the root of the alarm and irritation which it manifests at hearing that doubts are incompatible with a Catholic's profession, because it is sure that doubts will come upon him, and then how pitiable will be his state! That there can be peace, and joy, and knowledge, and freedom, and spiritual strength in the Church, is a thought far beyond the world's imagination; for it regards her simply as a frightful conspiracy against the happiness of man, seducing her victims by specious professions, and, when they are once hers, caring nothing for the misery which breaks upon them, so that by any means she may detain them in bondage. Accordingly, it conceives we are in perpetual warfare with our own reason, fierce objections ever rising within us, and we forcibly repressing them. It believes that, after the likeness of a vessel which has met with some accident at sea, we are ever baling out the water which rushes in upon us, and have hard work to keep afloat; we just manage to linger on, either by an unnatural strain on our minds, or by turning them away from the subject of religion. The world disbelieves our doctrines itself, and cannot understand our own believing them. It considers them so strange, that it is quite sure, though we will not confess it, that we are haunted day and night with doubts, and tormented with the apprehension of yielding to them. I really do think it is the world's judgment, that one principal part of a confessor's work is the putting down such misgivings in his penitents. It fancies that the reason is ever rebelling, like the flesh; that doubt, like concupiscence, is elicited by every sight and sound, and that temptation insinuates itself in every page of letter-press, and through the very voice of a Protestant polemic. When it sees a Catholic Priest, it looks hard at him, to make out how much there is of folly in his composition, and how much of hypocrisy. "

         Thank you  to the two people who sent translations in response to my plea yesterday for a translation for the following quote:   " O Sancti Montis Cassinensis, unde Anglia nostra olim saluberrimos Cathohicae doctrinae rivos hausit, orate pro nobis jam ex haeresi in pristinum vigorem expergiscentibus "  From Father Philip Bochanski:   "O Saints of Monte Cassino, whence our England once drew the saving streams of Catholic doctrine, pray for us, that we may soon wake up from heresy [and return] to [our] former vigor."  And from Henry Dieterich:  "O saints of Monte Cassino, whence the most salvific streams of Catholic doctrine for our England once arose, pray for us that we may now awaken from heresy in our original strength"  Mr. Dieterich adds: "Any translation is an approximation, but this cannot be exactly literal because the original uses grammatical constructions that have no parallel in English."  He also gave me links to his  urlLink webpage  and his   urlLink  blog  .

        From "On the Fitness of the Glories of Mary"   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  " If the Mother of Emmanuel ought to be the first of creatures in sanctity and in beet us imitate her purity, who, rather than relinquish her virginity, was willing to lose Him for a Son. O my dear children, young men and young women, what need have you of the intercession of the Virgin-mother, of her help, of her pattern, in this respect! What shall bring you forward in the narrow way, if you live in the world, but the thought and patronage of Mary? What shall seal your senses, what shall tranquillise your heart, when sights and sounds of danger are around you, but Mary? What shall give you patience and endurance, when you are wearied out with the length of the conflict with evil, with the unceasing necessity of precautions, with the irksomeness of observing them, with the tediousness of their repetition, with the strain upon your mind, with your forlorn and cheerless condition, but a loving communion with her! She will comfort you in your discouragements, solace you in your fatigues, raise you after your falls, reward you for your successes. She will show you her Son, your God and your all. When your spirit within you is excited, or relaxed, or depressed, when it loses its balance, when it is restless and wayward, when it is sick of what it has, and hankers after what it has not, when your eye is solicited with evil and your mortal frame trembles under the shadow of the tempter, what will bring you to yourselves, to peace and to health, but the cool breath of the Immaculate and the fragrance of the Rose of Sharon? It is the boast of the Catholic Religion, that it has the gift of making the young heart chaste; and why is this, but that it gives us Jesus Christ for our food, and Mary for our nursing Mother? Fulfil this boast in yourselves; prove to the world that you are following no false teaching, vindicate the glory of your Mother Mary, whom the world blasphemes, in the very face of the world, by the simplicity of your own deportment, and the sanctity of your words and deeds. Go to her for the royal heart of innocence. She is the beautiful gift of God, which outshines the fascinations of a bad world, and which no one ever sought in sincerity and was disappointed. She is the personal type and representative image of that spiritual life and renovation in grace, 'without which no one shall see God'. 'Her spirit is sweeter than honey, and her heritage than the honeycomb. They that eat her shall yet be hungry, and they that drink her shall still thirst. Whoso hearkeneth to her shall not be confounded, and they that work by her shall not sin.' "      Discourses to Mixed Congregations

        Umm... you know the guilty pleasure I'm linked to...  namely  urlLink  The Red Songbook of Westmarch  ?  Well, Eru help me, I've sent them in a contribution, and I'm posting it here.   (WARNING:SONG PARODY AHEAD ! SPOILERS, PLUS AN INABILITY TO DISASSOCIATE THE TALE OF THE FALL OF GONDOLIN WITH A PIECE OF 80'S MUSIC, MAY ENSUE .... )         With apologies to the Professor and to Mr. Springfield    Tuors Girl   (Sung by Maeglin, in a truly black mood )   Tuors never been a friend.  As if Id let a mortal be a friend of mine! But now I hate him more- its not hard to say why. He has dared to wed with Idril, for whose love Id gladly die.  And shes watching him with those eyes And shes loving him with that body-  ai, mel Eru !   And hes holding her in his arms late, late at night..  You know I wish that I had Tuors girl. I wish that I had Tuors girl. Why cant I find a maiden like that?   The King approves of him and her- Which proves that even the mightiest can err- And I must hide my anger as best as I can  When I see my Elven princess with that lowly mortal Man.   Cause shes watching him with those eyes And shes loving him with that body-  ai, mel Eru!   And hes holding her in his arms late, late at night.  You know I wish that I had Tuors girl. I wish that I had Tuors girl. Why cant I find a maiden? Why cant I find a maiden like that?   And Im looking in the mirror all the time Wondering what darkness she sees in me. So Im her cousin - why isnt that fine? Why does she want something I cant be?  Tell me, why cant I find a maiden like that?  You know I wish that I had Tuors girl. I wish that I had Tuors girl. Why cant I find a maiden like that? Like Tuors girl. I want Tuors girl. (The anger in his eyes is growing even darker)  Ill  have   Tuors girl..

       Interesting posts ...  over at   urlLink  Summa Contra   urlLink Mundum . They remind me of something I read about C.S. Lewis. It seems someone (a student, probably), told him the old joke about the atheist's tombstone- "All dressed up and no place to go." Whereupon Lewis remarked, "I'll bet  he   wishes that were true now. "  One of the most absurd, chilling, and insulting things I have ever read was a statement I ran across in a book I was thumbing through at a bookstore. The author (who happened to be female) stated that while for some women an unborn child is a baby they cherish, for others 'it' is merely the uncomfortable symptoms of pregnancy and the worries of a 'possible child', and therefore they have the right to get rid of 'it.' She had the further nerve to state that seeing the unborn as, objectively, either human or not, was the sort of 'male thinking' that women have had the sense to transcend, as if abandoning logic was some sort of female badge of honor. What really got to me was the fact that various statements on the cover called the book 'feminist.' Isn't saying that women are more illogical than men the sort of thing only 'sexist Neanderthals' engage in ?  Apparently I'm still enslaved by 'male thinking', inasmuch as I believe that 2+2=4 and that the law of noncontradiction has not been repealed. (End of rant. )

        The Feast of St. Januarius, Bishop and Martyr  is today. There is information on him  urlLink  here.  According to this  urlLink  link  courteously provided by  urlLink Fr. Sibley , the miracle had taken place yet again.   "As regards the miracles of the Catholic Church; if, indeed, miracles never can occur, then, indeed, impute the narratives to fraud; but till you prove they are not likely, we shall consider the histories which have come down to us true on the whole, though in particular cases they may be exaggerated or unfounded. Where, indeed, they can certainly be proved to be false, there we shall be bound to do our best to get rid of them; but till that is clear, we shall be liberal enough to allow others to use their private judgment in their favour, as we use ours in their disparagement. For myself, lest I appear in any way to be shrinking from a determinate judgment on the claims of some of those miracles and relics, which Protestants are so startled at, and to be hiding particular questions in what is vague and general, I will avow distinctly, that, putting out of the question the hypothesis of unknown laws of nature (that is, of the professed miracle being not miraculous), I think it impossible to withstand the evidence which is brought for the liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius at Naples, and for the motion of the eyes of the pictures of the Madonna in the Roman States. I see no reason to doubt the material of the Lombard crown at Monza; and I do not see why the Holy Coat at Trèves may not have been what it professes to be. I firmly believe that portions of the True Cross are at Rome and elsewhere, that the Crib of Bethlehem is at Rome, and the bodies of St. Peter and St. Paul also. I believe that at Rome too lies St. Stephen, that St. Matthew lies at Salerno, and St. Andrew at Amalfi. I firmly believe that the relics of the saints are doing innumerable miracles and graces daily, and that it needs only for a Catholic to show devotion to any saint in order to receive special benefits from his intercession. I firmly believe that saints in their life-time have before now raised the dead to life, crossed the sea without vessels, multiplied grain and bread, cured incurable diseases, and superseded the operation of the laws of the universe in a multitude of ways. Many men, when they hear an educated man so speak, will at once impute the avowal to insanity, or to an idiosyncrasy, or to imbecility of mind, or to decrepitude of powers, or to fanaticism, or to hypocrisy. They have a right to say so, if they will; and we have a right to ask them why they do not say it of those who bow down before the Mystery of mysteries, the Divine Incarnation. If they do not believe this, they are not yet Protestants; if they do, let them grant that He who has done the greater may do the less.

       On September 18, 1864....  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. preached a sermon on the Mass. As is true of most of his Catholic sermons, we do not have the complete text, as it was not the Catholic custom in England at the time to write out a complete sermon. However we do have his sermon notes, which are below.     "The Mass is to be viewed in two aspects(1) as it regards our Lord; (2) as it regards us. As it regards Him, it is the great act of sacrificial atonement. As regards us, the great act of intercession. Texts, {193} Rom. viii. 32 ; Heb. vii. 22-25 , ix. 15 and passim; 1 Tim. ii. 5-6 .  1. He is the great High Priest who is ever offering up His meritorious sacrifice, and the Mass is but the earthly presence of it.  2. While He offers it above, the whole Church intercedes. (1) Mary on high, and the saints with her. Thus a heavenly Mass is now going on above. (2) Belownot a light benefit that we may intercede.  We have indeed a hope within us that God will hear us for ourselves, but will He hear us for others? It is only through His wonderful meritorious sacrifice that we have this power, and therefore fitly in the Mass is the intercessory gift exercised. Therefore the very privilege of Catholics above others is intercessory prayer; it is the imputation and the imparting to their prayers the merit of the sacrifice. Therefore St. Paul says, 'Pray without ceasing.' St. James, etc. All intercessory prayer all over the whole world, e.g. litanies, the priest's office, the  breviary, is as it were in presence of the Mass. It is the great act of communion, etc. "

        From  The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien    (WARNING: SPOILERISH !)    A quote from a letter to Hugh Brogan, dated September 18, 1954: "Frodo is not intended to be another Bilbo. Though his opening style is not wholly unlike. But he is rather a study of a hobbit broken by a burden of fear and horror- broken down, and in the end made into something quite different. None of the hobbits come out of it in pure Shire-fashion. They wouldn't. "

       The Familiarity of Jesus  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " 1. The Holy Baptist was separated from the world. He was a Nazarite. He went out from the world, and placed himself over against it, and spoke to it from his vantage ground, and called it to repentance. Then went out all Jerusalem to him into the desert, and he confronted it face to face. But in his teaching he spoke of One who should come to them and speak to them in a far different way. He should not separate Himself from them, He should not display Himself as some higher being, but as their brother, as of their flesh and of their bones, as one among many brethren, as one of the multitude and amidst them; nay, He was among them already. ' Medius vestrum stetit, quem vos nescitis ''there hath stood in the midst of you, whom you know not.' That greater one called Himself the Son of manHe was content to be taken as ordinary in all respects, though He was the Highest. St. John and the other Evangelists, though so different in the character of their accounts of Him, agree most strikingly here. The Baptist says, 'There is in the midst of you One whom you know not.' Next we read of his pointing Jesus out privately, not to crowds, but to one or two of his awn religious followers; then of their seeking Jesus and being allowed to follow Him home. At length Jesus begins to disclose Himself and to manifest His glory in miracles; but where? At a marriage feast, where there was often excess, as the architriclinus implies. And how? in adding to the wine, the instrument of such excess, when it occurred. He was at that marriage feast not as a teacher, but as a guest, and (so to speak) in a social way, for He was with His Mother. Now compare this with what He says in St. Matthew's Gospel of Himself: 'John came neither eating nor drinkingThe Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say: Behold a man that is a glutton and wine-drinker.' John might be hated, but he was respected; Jesus was despised. See also Mark i. 22, 27, 37, iii. 21, for the astonishment and rudeness of all about Him. The objection occurs  at once , ii. 16. What a marked feature it must have been of our Lord's character and mission, since two Evangelists, so independent in their narrations, record it! The prophet had said the same (Isai. liii. 'He shall,' &c.).  2. This was, O dear Lord, because Thou so lovest this human nature which Thou hast created. Thou didst not love us merely as Thy creatures, the work of Thy hands, but as men. Thou lovest all, for Thou hast created all; but Thou lovest man more than all. How is it, Lord, that this should be? What is there in man, above others?  Quid est homo, quod memor es ejus? yet, nusquam Angelos apprehendit  'What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?'  'nowhere doth he take hold of the angels.' Who can sound the depth of Thy counsels and decrees? Thou hast loved man more than Thou hast loved the Angels: and therefore, as Thou didst not take on Thee an angelic nature when Thou didst manifest Thyself for our salvation, so too Thou wouldest not come in any shape or capacity or office which was above the course of ordinary human lifenot as a Nazarite, not as a Levitical priest, not as a monk, not as a hermit, but in the fulness and exactness of that human nature which so much Thou lovest. Thou camest not only a perfect man, but as proper man; not formed anew out of earth, not with the spiritual body which Thou now hast, but in that very flesh which had fallen in Adam, and with all our infirmities, all our feelings and sympathies, sin excepted.  3. O Jesu, it became Thee, the great God, thus abundantly and largely to do Thy work, for which the Father sent Thee. Thou didst not do it by halvesand, while that magnificence of Sacrifice is Thy glory as God, it is our consolation and aid as sinners. O dearest Lord, Thou art more fully man than the holy Baptist, than St. John, Apostle and Evangelist, than Thy own sweet Mother. As in Divine knowledge of me Thou art beyond them all, so also in experience and personal knowledge of my nature. Thou art my elder brother. How can I fear, how should I not repose my whole heart on one so gentle, so tender, so familiar, so unpretending, so modest, so natural, so humble? Thou art now, though in heaven, just the same as Thou wast on earth: the mighty God, yet the little childthe all-holy, yet the all-sensitive, all-human.

        I was disappointed...  in the episode of "Historic Catholic Converts" on EWTN last night. It was on Venerable John Henry Newman, but the chronology of his leaving the Anglican ministry and his progress towards Catholicism was somewhat muddled in its dates. Worse, it referred to priests of the Congregation of the Oratory as "diocesan priests who live in community." No, they are  secular  priests who live in community. Each Congregation of the Oratory is a house of Pontifical Right, and the local bishop cannot interfere with the internal workings of the House. (He has oversight of the outside ministries, of course, but that is another matter. ) Finally, the program failed to mention that Newman is now a Venerable, or to request prayers for his canonization. Now, would it have taken that long to give his cause a bit of a boost ? .... sigh.....

        The Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows  is today. There is information on it  urlLink  here.   Mary is the "Regina Martyrum," the Queen of Martyrs  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    "Why is she so called?she who never had any blow, or wound, or other injury to her consecrated person. How can she be exalted over those whose bodies suffered the most ruthless violences and the keenest torments for our Lord's sake? She is, indeed, Queen of all Saints, of those who 'walk with Christ in white, for they are worthy;' but how of those 'who were slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held?'  To answer this question, it must be recollected that the pains of the soul may be as fierce as those of the body. Bad men who are now in hell, and the elect of God who are in purgatory, are suffering only in their souls, for their bodies are still in the dust;yet how severe is that suffering! And perhaps most people who have lived long can bear witness in their own persons to a sharpness of distress which was like a sword cutting them, to a weight and force of sorrow which seemed to throw them down, though bodily pain there was none.  What an overwhelming horror it must have been for the Blessed Mary to witness the Passion and the Crucifixion of her Son! Her anguish was, as Holy Simeon had announced to her, at the time of that Son's Presentation in the Temple, a sword piercing her soul. If our Lord Himself could not bear the prospect of what was before Him, and was covered in the thought of it with a bloody sweat, His soul thus acting upon His body, does not this show how great mental pain can be? and would it have been wonderful though Mary's head and heart had given way as she stood under His Cross?  Thus is she most truly the Queen of  Martyrs ."     Meditations and Devotions

        Well, the Mass with the Bishop went well...  as did the blessing of the National Newman Library afterwards. Here is the music from the Mass (a Mass of the Holy Spirit for the Opening of the School Year) : Processional: "Come Holy Ghost" Offertory: "O God Beyond All Praising" - Gustav Holst ( 1874- 1934) Communion: "Ave Verum" - Edward Elgar (1857-1934)  Recessional: "Lift High the Cross"   One of the local newspapers did a short piece in the Sunday edition on the blessing. It should be taken with a bit of salt as the writer seems to buy into the "Newman-as-liberal-icon" thing , as well as committing some errors of fact, errors of emphasis, and infelicitous expressions. (For example, the Venerable's journey into the Church took six years, not two. St. Thomas Aquinas is hardly a representative of the 'early church'-  and St. Thomas's influence on the Venerable was not all that strong. "Eastern Orthodox mystics' seems to be the writer's confused term for the Greek Fathers of the Church. ...and so on. ) Also, for some reason the word "Oratory" is not capitalized as it should be, which is puzzling. I am, however, glad that they mentioned the attempt that will be made to digitize the originals of Venerable Newman's writings and put them on the Internet. (Now does that sound cool or what ? !!!)    Bearing all this in mind,  urlLink  here it is.  For anyone in the Pittsburgh area, the print version has two photographs with it, one of which is of Fr. Drew Morgan, C.O., of the Pittsburgh Oratory.

        The Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross  is today. There is information on it  urlLink  here.   "It is the death of the Eternal Word of God made flesh, which is our great lesson how to think and how to speak of this world. His Cross has put its due value upon every thing which we see, upon all fortunes, all advantages, all ranks, all dignities, all pleasures; upon the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. It has set a price upon the excitements, the rivalries, the hopes, the fears, the desires, the efforts, the triumphs of mortal man. It has given a meaning to the various, shifting course, the trials, the temptations, the sufferings, of his earthly state. It has brought together and made consistent all that seemed discordant and aimless. It has taught us how to live, how to use this world, what to expect, what to desire, what to hope. It is the tone into which all the strains of this world's music are ultimately to be resolved.  Look around, and see what the world presents of high and low. Go to the court of princes. See the treasure and skill of all nations brought together to honour a child of man. Observe the prostration of the many before the few. Consider the form and ceremonial, the pomp, the state, the circumstance; and the vainglory. Do you wish to know the worth of it all? Look at the Cross of Christ.  Go to the political world: see nation jealous of nation, trade rivalling trade, armies and fleets matched against each other. Survey the various ranks of the community, its parties and their contests, the strivings of the ambitious, the intrigues of the crafty. What is the end of all this turmoil? The grave. What is the measure? The Cross.  Go, again, to the world of intellect and science: consider the wonderful discoveries which the human mind is making, the variety of arts to which its discoveries give rise, the all but miracles by which it shows its power; and next, the pride and confidence of reason, and the absorbing devotion of thought to transitory objects, which is the consequence. Would you form a right judgment of all this? Look at the Cross.   Again: look at misery, look at poverty and destitution, look at oppression and captivity; go where food is scanty, and lodging unhealthy. Consider pain and suffering, diseases long or violent, all that is frightful and revolting. Would you know how to rate all these? Gaze upon the Cross.  Thus in the Cross, and Him who hung upon it, all things meet; all things subserve it, all things need it. It is their centre and their interpretation. For He was lifted up upon it, that He might draw all men and all things unto Him. "  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Parochial and Plain Sermons

       For Saturday    Mary is the "Mater Admirabilis," the Wonderful Mother  by Venerable John Henry Newman. C.O.   "When Mary, the  Virgo Praedicanda , the Virgin who is to be proclaimed aloud, is called by the title of  Admirabilis , it is thereby suggested to us what the  effect  is of the preaching of her as Immaculate in her Conception. The Holy Church proclaims, preaches her, as conceived without original sin; and those who hear, the children of Holy Church, wonder, marvel, are astonished and overcome by the preaching. It is so great a prerogative.  Even created excellence is fearful to think of when it is so high as Mary's. As to the great  Creator , when Moses desired to see His glory, He Himself says about Himself, 'Thou canst not see My face, for man shall not see Me and live;' and St. Paul says, 'Our God is a consuming fire.' And when St. John, holy as he was, saw only the  Human Nature  of our Lord, as He is in Heaven, 'he fell at His feet as dead.' And so as regards the appearance of angels. The holy Daniel, when St. Gabriel appeared to him, 'fainted away, and lay in a consternation, with his face close to the ground.' When this great archangel came to Zacharias, the father of St. John the Baptist, he too 'was troubled, and fear fell upon him.'  But it was otherwise with Mary when the same St. Gabriel came to her. She was overcome indeed, and troubled at his  words , because, humble as she was in her own opinion of herself, he addressed her as 'Full of grace,' and 'Blessed among women;'but she was able to bear the sight of him.  Hence we learn two things: first, how great a holiness was Mary's, seeing she could endure the presence of an angel, whose brightness smote the holy prophet Daniel even to fainting and almost to death; and secondly, since she is so much holier than that angel, and we so much less holy than Daniel, what great reason we have to call her the  Virgo Admirabilis , the Wonderful, the Awful Virgin, when we think of her ineffable purity!  There are those who are so thoughtless, so blind, so grovelling as to think that Mary is not as much shocked at wilful sin as her Divine Son is, and that we can make her our friend and advocate, though we go to her without contrition at heart, without even the wish for true repentance and resolution to amend. As if Mary could hate sin less, and love sinners more, than our Lord does! No: she feels a sympathy for those only who wish to  leave  their sins; else, how should she be without sin herself? No: if even to the best of us she is, in the words of Scripture, 'fair as the moon, bright as the sun, and  terrible as an army set in array , what is she to the impenitent sinner? "   Meditations and Devotions

        Childhood literary memories...  Over at  urlLink  HMS Blog , there is a series of posts on books which were favorites of the posters as children. I remember that when I was eight my two favorite books were, believe it or not, the book of Genesis (which I read from my grandmother's beat-up Douay-Rheims Bible), and  Mythology   by Edith Hamilton. ( Yes, I  was   a weird kid. ) In Genesis, I was fascinated by the 'baby competition' between between Leah and Rachel. I think it was because I'm an only child, and I found the idea of a family with that many siblings amazing. In the Hamilton book, I was very fond of the line drawings, particularly one of Glaucus and Scylla in which poor, lovesick Glaucus has dragged himself, mermans scaly tail and all, up to the rock where the then-pretty Scylla looks down upon him with disdain.    When I got to college, I took a class called "Biblical and Mythological Backgrounds to Literature". When I got the list of required books,  I spotted  Mythology  on it, and nearly burst out laughing, wondering if there was anybody who had taken that course for whom that book would be a nostalgia kick.

        For Friday   The Power of the Cross  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "1. My God, who could have imagined, by any light of nature, that it was one of Thy attributes to lower Thyself, and to work out Thy purposes by Thy own humiliation and suffering? Thou hadst lived from eternity in ineffable blessedness. My God, I might have understood as much as this, viz. that, when Thou didst begin to create and surround Thyself with a world of creatures, that these attributes would show themselves in Thee which before had no exercise. Thou couldest not show Thy power when there was nothing whatever to exercise it. Then too, Thou didst begin to show thy wonderful and tender providence, Thy faithfulness, Thy solicitous care for those whom Thou hadst created. But who could have fancied that Thy creation of the universe implied and involved in it Thy humiliation? O my great God, Thou hast humbled Thyself, Thou hast stooped to take our flesh and blood, and hast been lifted up upon the tree! I praise and glorify Thee tenfold the more, because Thou hast shown Thy power by means of Thy suffering, than hadst Thou carried on Thy work without it. It is worthy of Thy infinitude thus to surpass and transcend all our thoughts.   2. O my Lord Jesu, I believe, and by Thy grace will ever believe and hold, and I know that it is true, and will be true to the end of the world, that nothing great is done without suffering, without humiliation, and that all things are possible by means of it. I believe, O my God, that poverty is better than riches, pain better than pleasure, obscurity and contempt than name, and ignominy and reproach than honour. My Lord, I do not ask Thee to bring these trials on me, for I know not if I could face them; but at least, O Lord, whether I be in prosperity or adversity, I will believe that it is as I have said. I will never have faith in riches, rank, power, or reputation. I will never set my heart on worldly success or on worldly advantages. I will never wish for what men call the prizes of life. I will ever, with Thy grace, make much of those who are despised or neglected, honour the poor, revere the suffering, and admire and venerate Thy saints and confessors, and take my part with them in spite of the world.  3. And lastly, O my dear Lord, though I am so very weak that I am not fit to ask Thee for suffering as a gift, and have not strength to do so, at least I will beg of Thee grace to meet suffering well, when Thou in Thy love and wisdom dost bring it upon me. Let me bear pain, reproach, disappointment, slander, anxiety, suspense, as Thou wouldest have me, O my Jesu, and as Thou by Thy own suffering hast taught me, when it comes. And I promise too, with Thy grace, that I will never set myself up, never seek pre-eminence, never court any great thing of the world,  never prefer myself to others. I wish to bear insult meekly, and to return good for evil. I wish to humble myself in all things, and to be silent when I am ill-used, and to be patient when sorrow or pain is prolonged, and all for the love of Thee, and Thy Cross, knowing that in this way I shall gain the promise both of this life and of the next.

       Close encounters  of the  urlLink P.O.D.  kind....  Last night was the bi-weekly meeting of the Secular Oratory in Pittsburgh. After the prayers and talks were over, but before recreation, Fr. Bryan, who is the Father Prefect, showed us one of the more precious things in the Pittsburgh Oratory-  a first-class relic of the Venerable !   Now to most people, perhaps even many Catholics nowadays, it wouldn't be much- a small clump of white hair. But to actually see- and touch- hair from that wise and holy head... wow.   Then today, out of the blue, I was given a rosary bracelet that had been blessed by the Holy Father, by a priest who is studying in Rome and is heading back there next week. (Prayers for his safe travel would be most welcome.)   I just hope this doesn't mean that I'm going to be hit with a lot of temptations and difficulties and I'm being strengthened ahead of time!

        September 25, 1843  was not an easy day in the life of Venerable John Henry Newman. It was the anniversary of the dedication of the Anglican church building in the village of Littlemore- a church which he had raised the money to build. His beloved, now  deceased, mother had laid the cornerstone, and there was a memorial plaque reading "Sacred to the memory of Jemima Newman" featured prominently on one wall. He himself noted the day down: " September 25.Littlemore commemoration; Pusey administered sacrament;   H. W. came; I preached No. 604, my last sermon....."  And as a biographer later put it: "On September 25 he preached at Littlemore his sermon on the Parting of Friends....He told in that sermon, clearly for those who understood, how he himself had found the Church of his birth and of his early affections wanting; how he was torn asunder between the claims of those he must leave behind him and those who would follow him; that he could speak to his friends no more from that pulpit, but could only commit them to God and bid them strive to do His will. His voice broke (so the tradition runs) and his words were interrupted by the sobs of his hearers as he said his last words of farewell." - Wilfrid Ward,  Life of Cardinal Newman, Volumes 1 and 2   The sermon is here :   urlLink  "The Parting of Friends"  The final paragraph always moves me the most...  "And, O my brethren, O kind and affectionate hearts, O loving friends, should you know any one whose lot it has been, by writing or by word of mouth, in some degree to help you thus to act; if he has ever told you what you knew about yourselves, or what you did not know; has read to you your wants or feelings, and comforted you by the very reading; has made you feel that there was a higher life than this daily one, and a brighter world than that you see; or encouraged you, or sobered you, or opened a way to the inquiring, or soothed the perplexed; if what he has said or done has ever made you take interest in him, and feel well inclined towards him; remember such a one in time to come, though you hear him not, and pray for him, that in all things he may know God's will, and at all times he may be ready to fulfil it. "  It was an end- and it would be two more years before he would come to a new beginning. Yet that beginning would come.

        The Feast of Blessed Herman Contractus  is today. There is information on him  urlLink  here.   Here is his most famous composition:   Salve Regina, Mater misericordiae, Vita dulcedo et spes nostra salve. Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevae. Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes, in hac lacrimarum valle. Eja ergo advocata nostra, illos tuos misericordes oculos ad nos converte. Et Jesum benedictum fructum ventris tui nobis post hoc exsilium ostende. O clemens, o pia, o dulcis Virgo Maria.    A note: the next time you pray this, either in the original Latin or in English ("Hail, Holy Queen...), remember that if the author were conceived today,  urlLink it's probable his parents would be pressured to kill him before his birth.

       In honor of today's Feast...  a bit of verse....  The Pilgrim Queen    (A Song.)   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " There sat a Lady                all on the ground,  Rays of the morning                circled her round,  Save thee, and hail to thee,                Gracious and Fair,  In the chill twilight                what wouldst thou there?   'Here I sit desolate,'                sweetly said she,  'Though I'm a queen,                and my name is Marie:  Robbers have rifled                my garden and store,  Foes they have stolen                my Heir from my bower.'  'They said they could keep Him                far better than I,  In a palace all His,                planted deep and raised high.  'Twas a palace of ice,                hard and cold as were they,  And when summer came,                it all melted away.'   'Next would they barter Him,                Him the Supreme,  For the spice of the desert,                and gold of the stream;  And me they bid wander                in weeds and alone,  In this green merry land                which once was my own.'   I look'd on that Lady,                and out from her eyes  Came the deep glowing blue                of Italy's skies;  And she raised up her head                and she smiled, as a Queen  On the day of her crowning,                so bland and serene.   'A moment,' she said,                'and the dead shall revive;  The giants are failing,                the Saints are alive;  I am coming to rescue                my home and my reign,  And Peter and Philip                are close in my train.' "   The Oratory. 1849.

        The Feast of Our Lady of Walsingham   is today. There is information on it urlLink  here.   Prayers for the return of Mary's Dowry, England, to the Faith would be especially appropriate. There is a link to the shrine website urlLink  here.   The original shrine was, of course, destroyed by Henry VIII's henchmen. The following Elizabethan-era  ballad was written to mourn the loss of this great place of pilgrimage. Tradtionally, it was ascribed to  urlLink  St. Philip Howard , but the authorship is not certain.     A Lament for Our Lady's Shrine at Walsingham    "In the wrackes of Walsingam  Whom should I chuse  But the Queene of Walsingam  To be guide to my muse?  Then thou Prince of Walsingam  Grant me to frame  Bitter plaintes to rewe thy wronge  Bitter wo for thy name.  Bitter was it oh to see  The seely sheepe  Murdered by the raveninge wolves  While the sheephards did sleep.  Bitter was it oh to vewe  The sacred vyne  While the gardiners plaied all close  Rooted up by the swine.  Bitter, bitter oh to behould  The grasse to growe  Where the walls of Walsingam  So stately did shewe.  Such were the works of Walsingam  While shee did stand  Such are the wrackes as now do shewe  Of that so holy land.  Levell levell with the ground  The towres doe lye  Which with their golden, glitteringe tops  Pearsed once to the skye.  Where weare gates no gates are nowe,  The waies unknowen,  Where the press of peares did passe  While her fame far was blowen.  Oules do scrike where the sweetest himnes  Lately weer songe,  Toades and serpents hold their dennes  Wher the palmers did thronge.  Weepe, weepe O Walsingam,  Whose dayes are nightes,  Blessings turned to blasphemies,  Holy deeds to dispites.  Sinne is wher our Ladie sate,  Heaven turned is to hell,  Satham sittes wher our Lord did swaye,  Walsingam, oh farewell ! "

        From  An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  " Let them (ed. critics of Catholicism) consider, that if they can criticize history, the facts of history certainly can retort upon them. It might, I grant, be clearer on this great subject than it is. This is no great concession. History is not a creed or a catechism, it gives lessons rather than rules; still no one can mistake its general teaching in this matter, whether he accept it or stumble at it. Bold outlines and broad masses of colour rise out of the records of the past. They may be dim, they may be incomplete; but they are definite. And this one thing at least is certain; whatever history teaches, whatever it omits, whatever it exaggerates or extenuates, whatever it says and unsays, at least the Christianity of history is not Protestantism. If ever there were a safe truth, it is this.  And Protestantism has ever felt it so. I do not mean that every writer on the Protestant side has felt it; for it was the fashion at first, at least as a rhetorical argument against Rome, to appeal to past ages, or to some of them; but Protestantism, as a whole, feels it, and has felt it. This is shown in the determination already referred to of dispensing with historical Christianity altogether, and of forming a Christianity from the Bible alone: men never would have put it aside, unless they had despaired of it. It is shown by the long neglect of ecclesiastical history in England, which prevails even in the English Church. Our popular religion scarcely recognizes the fact of the twelve long ages which lie between the Councils of Nicaea and Trent, except as affording one or two passages to illustrate its wild interpretations of certain prophesies of St. Paul and St. John. It is melancholy to say it, but the chief, perhaps the only English writer who has any claim to be considered an ecclesiastical historian, is the unbeliever Gibbon. To be deep in history is to cease to be a Protestant. "

" The suggestion has been made that people who say, "Love the sinner but hate the sin," are generally hypocrites who don't, in fact, love the sinner.That may well be true. Loving the saint is hard enough -- at least if the saint is still alive, and especially if he lives with you -- "

        The Feast of St. Pio of Pietrelcina  is today. There is information on him  urlLink  here.   While he is undoubtedly an important saint, I'm afraid his canonization process gave me bouts of cause envy.Thinking "Now why aren't there Venerable Newman holy cards in every pamphlet rack and devotional pictures of him in every Catholic bookstore?" -that kind of thing. Plus I've occasionally had to correct folks who complimented me on "that great Padre Pio medal" when what I wear is, of course, a medal of  urlLink  St. Philip Neri  .

        On this day, 164 years ago...  Venerable John Henry Newman wrote a letter to a friend, in which he admitted that a blow had been given to his Anglican foundations....  REV. J. H. NEWMAN TO F. ROGERS, ESQ.   Oriel College: September 22, 1839.   "Since I wrote to you, I have had the first real hit from Romanism which has happened to me. R. W., who has been passing through, directed my attention to Dr. Wiseman's article in the new 'Dublin.' (ed. This was an article on the Donatist schism, in which Wiseman quoted St. Augustine of Hippo's famous line  Securus judicat orbis terrarum , which roughly translates to 'in the secure judgement of the whole world')  I must confess it has given me a stomach-ache. You see the whole history of the Monophysites has been a sort of alterative. And now comes this dose at the end of it. It does certainly come upon one that we are not at the bottom of things. At this moment we have sprung a leak; and the worst of it is that those sharp fellows, Ward, Stanley, and Co., will not let one go to sleep upon it.  Curavimus Babylonem et non est curata  was an awkward omen. I have not said so much to anyone.  I seriously think this a most uncomfortable article on every account, though of course it is  ex parte  ... I think I shall get Keble to answer it. As to Pusey, I am curious to see how it works with him.  And now,  carissime , good-bye. It is no laughing matter. I will not blink the question, so be it; but you don't suppose I am a madcap to take up notions suddenlyonly there is an uncomfortable vista opened which was closed before. I am writing upon my first feelings. "   That "uncomfortable vista" was to open out even more for him, and Keble and Pusey were not able to give him the answers he needed .....

       Now what is   this  about ?    urlLink Officials Say Cloistered Nuns Are Security Risks :Immigration Service Says Sisters Don't Qualify For Visas   The sentence that stuck out to me ?  "Both Korean sisters may be deported because the U.S. Immigration Service said they don't qualify for religious worker visas. "   Why don't they qualify ? Is it because the visas are for religious  workers  and the work of cloistered contemplatives, prayer,  isn't considered 'real work' ? I've noticed an animus against contemplatives even among certain Catholics ("Why aren't they out  doing   something ?") and I have a sneaking suspicion that this bias might be a factor. I pray that I am wrong.   Link courtesy of  urlLink  Annunciations

        From "The Religion of the Pharisee, The Religion of Mankind"   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Now this age is as removed in distance, as in character, from that of the Greek philosopher; yet who will say that the religion which it acts upon is very different from the religion of the heathen? Of course I understand well, that it might know, and that it will say, a great many things foreign and contrary to heathenism. I am well aware that the theology of this age is very different from what it was two thousand years ago. I know men profess a great deal, and boast that they are Christians, and speak of Christianity as being a religion of the heart; but, when we put aside words and professions, and try to discover what their religion is, we shall find, I fear, that the great mass of men in fact get rid of all religion that is inward; that they lay no stress on acts of faith, hope, and charity, on simplicity of intention, purity of motive, or mortification of the thoughts; that they confine themselves to two or three virtues, superficially practised; that they know not the words contrition, penance, and pardon; and that they think and argue that, after all, if a man does his duty in the world, according to his vocation, he cannot fail to go to heaven, however little he may do besides, nay, however much, in other matters, he may do that is undeniably unlawful. Thus a soldier's duty is loyalty, obedience, and valour, and he may let other matters take their chance; a trader's duty is honesty; an artisan's duty is industry and contentment; of a gentleman are required veracity, courteousness, and self-respect; of a public man, high-principled ambition; of a woman, the domestic virtues; of a minister of religion, decorum, benevolence, and some activity. Now, all these are instances of mere Pharisaical excellence; because there is no apprehension of Almighty God, no insight into His claims on us, no sense of the creature's shortcomings, no self-condemnation, confession, and deprecation, nothing of those deep and sacred feelings which ever characterize the religion of a Christian, and more and more, not less and less, as he mounts up from mere ordinary obedience to the perfection of a saint.  And such, I say, is the religion of the natural man in every age and place;often very beautiful on the surface, but worthless in God's sight; good, as far as it goes, but worthless and hopeless, because it does not go further, because it is based on self-sufficiency, and results in self-satisfaction. I grant, it may be beautiful to look at, as in the instance of the young ruler whom our Lord looked at and loved, yet sent away sad; it may have all the delicacy, the amiableness, the tenderness, the religious sentiment, the kindness, which is actually seen in many a father of a family, many a mother, many a daughter, in the length and breadth of these kingdoms, in a refined and polished age like this; but still it is rejected by the heart-searching God, because all such persons walk by their own light, not by the True Light of men, because self is their supreme teacher, and because they pace round and round in the small circle of their own thoughts and of their own judgments, careless to know what God says to them, and fearless of being condemned by Him, if only they stand approved in their own sight. And thus they incur the force of those terrible words, spoken not to a Jewish Ruler, nor to a heathen philosopher, but to a fallen Christian community, to the Christian Pharisees of Laodicea,'Because thou sayest I am rich, and made wealthy, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked; I counsel thee to buy of Me gold fire-tried, that thou mayest be made rich, and be clothed in white garments, that thy shame may not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see. Such as I love, I rebuke and chastise; be zealous, therefore, and do penance.' "    Sermons Preached on Various Occasions

        Just because ....  I'm posting a link from the great   urlLink Biblical Evidence for Catholicism   website: Mr. Armstrong's fine page of   urlLink John Henry Cardinal Newman: Photograph and Portrait Page   I, like Fr. Ker, am fond of the sketch by Lady Coleridge- I find the eyes particularly haunting.  I also find one of the quotes very revealing, not so much about the Venerable himself as about the kind of prejudice he and other Catholics in the England of his time had to put up with.   " A man who visited Newman in 1875 describes him:   '. . . very kindly, with a sort of grave sweet simplicity which coming from so old a man, has in it something inexpressibly touching . . . He looks very aged, hair more white than silvery, body stooped, a very large and prominent nose and large chin, brow which seems good, though one can't see it for the tangled hair falling over it; an air of melancholy, as of one who has passed through terrible struggles, yet of serenity, as of one who had found peace. Not a priest in his manner -  still an Englishman more than a Roman Catholic.   ' (ed. my emphasis)  "  "Still an Englishman more than a Roman Catholic"...as if one couldn't be both. As if the Venerable  wasn't  both. And this was from a  friendly  source.

       For Friday     "O God, be merciful to me, a sinner." Luke xviii. 13.    "These words set before us what may be called the characteristic mark of the Christian Religion, as contrasted with the various forms of worship and schools of belief, which in early or in later times have spread over the earth. They are a confession of sin and a prayer for mercy. Not indeed that the notion of transgression and of forgiveness was introduced by Christianity, and is unknown beyond its pale; on the contrary, most observable it is, the symbols of guilt and pollution, and rites of deprecation and expiation, are more or less common to them all; but what is peculiar to our divine faith, as to Judaism before it, is this, that confession of sin enters into the idea of its highest saintliness, and that its pattern worshippers and the very heroes of its history are only, and can only be, and cherish in their hearts the everlasting memory that they are, and carry with them into heaven the rapturous avowal of their being, redeemed, restored transgressors. Such an avowal is not simply wrung from the lips of the neophyte, or of the lapsed; it is not the cry of the common run of men alone, who are buffeting with the surge of temptation in the wide world; it is the hymn of saints, it is the triumphant ode sounding from the heavenly harps of the Blessed before the Throne, who sing to their Divine Redeemer, 'Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God in Thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation.'  And what is to the Saints above a theme of never-ending thankfulness, is, while they are yet on earth, the matter of their perpetual humiliation. Whatever be their advance in the spiritual life, they never rise from their knees, they never cease to beat their breasts, as if sin could possibly be strange to them while they were in the flesh. Even our Lord Himself, the very Son of God in human nature, and infinitely separate from sin,even His Immaculate Mother, encompassed by His grace from the first beginnings of her existence, and without any part of the original stain,even they, as descended from Adam, were subjected at least to death, the direct, emphatic punishment of sin. And much more, even the most favoured of that glorious company, whom He has washed clean in His Blood; they never forget what they were by birth; they confess, one and all, that they are children of Adam, and of the same nature as their brethren, and compassed with infirmities while in the flesh, whatever may be the grace given them and their own improvement of it. Others may look up to them, but they ever look up to God; others may speak of their merits, but they only speak of their defects. The young and unspotted, the aged and most mature, he who has sinned least, he who has repented most, the fresh innocent brow, and the hoary head, they unite in this one litany, 'O God, be merciful to me, a sinner.' So it was with St. Aloysius; so, on the other hand, was it with St. Ignatius; so was it with St. Rose, the youngest of the saints, who, as a child, submitted her tender frame to the most amazing penances; so was it with St. Philip Neri, one of the most aged, who, when some one praised him, cried out, 'Begone! I am a devil, and not a saint;' and when going to communicate, would protest before his Lord, that he 'was good for nothing, but to do evil.' Such utter self-prostration, I say, is the very badge and token of the servant of Christ;and this indeed is conveyed in His own words, when He says, 'I am not come to call the just, but sinners;' and it is solemnly recognized and inculcated by Him, in the words which follow the text, 'Every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.'

       For Thursday   "We believe that our Lord's human Body and Blood are actually present in the Host and in the Chalice. The explicitness of His own words has forbidden Catholics, in every age, to regard that Presence as conditioned in any way by the faith of the communicant or the worshipper. To say, or to imply, that the change effected by the words of consecration is only a change of significance is to rob our Lord's own words of their plain force. Yet it is a matter of experience that no change perceptible to the senses, whether of size, shape, colour, or texture is observable in the Sacred Elements. Are we to suppose, then, that our senses here delude us? We cannot willingly associate such deception with any work of God. It follows, then, that the accidents (the philosophical description of all that falls within the province of our senses) really remain unchanged. And from that it follows that the substance in which those accidents inhere must have been the thing changed; this is the last stronghold of reality. Transubstantiation is the only doctrine which will secure fidelity to tradition on one side, and the evidence of our senses on the other. The Mass, in which this momentous change is effected, is held by Catholics to be a true Sacrifice--the renewal of that Sacrifice made once for all on Calvary. "- Msgr. Ronald Knox,   The Belief of Catholics

       The Feast of the Guardian Angels  is today. There is information on them  urlLink  here.    Guardian Angel   by Venerable John Henry Newman. C.O.   "My oldest friend, mine from the hour      When first I drew my breath;  My faithful friend, that shall be mine,      Unfailing, till my death;   Thou hast been ever at my side;      My Maker to thy trust  Consign'd my soul, what time He framed      The infant child of dust.   No beating heart in holy prayer,      No faith, inform'd aright,  Gave me to Joseph's tutelage,      Or Michael's conquering might.   Nor patron Saint, nor Mary's love,      The dearest and the best,  Has known my being, as thou hast known,      And blest, as thou hast blest.   Thou wast my sponsor at the font;      And thou, each budding year,  Didst whisper elements of truth      Into my childish ear.   And when, ere boyhood yet was gone,      My rebel spirit fell,  Ah! thou didst see, and shudder too,      Yet bear each deed of Hell.   And then in turn, when judgments came,      And scared me back again,  Thy quick soft breath was near to soothe      And hallow every pain.   Oh! who of all thy toils and cares      Can tell the tale complete,  To place me under Mary's smile,      And Peter's royal feet!   And thou wilt hang about my bed,      When life is ebbing low;  Of doubt, impatience, and of gloom,      The jealous sleepless foe.   Mine, when I stand before the Judge;      And mine, if spared to stay  Within the golden furnace, till      My sin is burn'd away.   And mine, O Brother of my soul,      When my release shall come;  Thy gentle arms shall lift me then,      Thy wings shall waft me home. "   The Oratory. 1853.

       From "Mysteries of Nature and Grace"  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "If the Almighty had no beginning He must have lived a whole eternity by Himself. What an awful thought! for us, our happiness lies in looking up to some object, or pursuing some end; we, poor mortal men, cannot understand a prolonged rest, except as a sort of sloth and self-forgetfulness; we are wearied if we meditate for one short hour; what then is meant when it is said, that He, the Great God, passed infinite ages by Himself? What was the end of His being? He was His own end; how incomprehensible! And since He lived a whole eternity by Himself, He might, had He so willed, never have created anything; and then from eternity to eternity there would have been none but He, none to witness Him, none to contemplate Him, none to adore and praise Him. How oppressive to think of! that there should have been no space, no time, no succession, no variation, no progression, no scope, no termination. One Infinite Being from first to last, and nothing else! And why He? Which is the less painful to our imagination, the idea of only one Being in existence, or of nothing at all? O my brethren, here is mystery without mitigation, without relief! how severe and frightful! The mysteries of Revelation, the Catholic dogmas, inconceivable as they are, are most gracious, most loving, laden with mercy and consolation to us, not only sublime, but touching and winning;such is the doctrine that God became man. Incomprehensible it is, and we can but adore, when we hear that the Almighty Being, of whom I have been speaking, 'who inhabiteth eternity,' has taken flesh and blood of a Virgin's veins, lain in a Virgin's womb, been suckled at a Virgin's breast, been obedient to human parents,worked at a humble trade, been despised by His own, been buffeted and scourged by His creatures, been nailed hand and foot to a Cross, and has died a malefactor's death; and that now, under the form of Bread, He should lie upon our Altars, and suffer Himself to be hidden in a small tabernacle!  Most incomprehensible, but still, while the thought overwhelms our imagination, it also overpowers our heart; it is the most subduing, affecting, piercing thought which can be pictured to us. It thrills through us, and draws our tears, and abases us, and melts us into love and affection, when we dwell upon it. O most tender and compassionate Lord! You see, He puts out of our sight that mysteriousness of His, which is only awful and terrible; He insists not on His past eternity; He would not scare and trouble His poor children, when at length He speaks to them; no, He does but surround Himself with His own infinite bountifulness and compassion; He bids His Church tell us only of His mysterious condescension. Still our reason, prying, curious reason, searches out for us those prior and more austere mysteries, which are attached to His Being, and He suffers us to find them out. He suffers us, for He knows that that same reason, though it recoils from them, must put up with them; He knows that they will be felt by it to be clear, inevitable truths, appalling as they are. He suffers it to discover them, in order that, both by the parallel and by the contrast between what reason infers and what the Church reveals, we may be drawn on from the awful discoveries of the one to the gracious announcements of the other; and in order, too, that the rejection of Revelation may be its own punishment, and that they who stumble at the Catholic mysteries may be dashed back upon the adamantine rocks which base the throne of the Everlasting, and may wrestle with the stern conclusions of reason, since they refuse the bright consolations of faith."

       The Feast of St. Therese of Lisieux, Virgin and Doctor of the Church  is today. There is information on her  urlLink  here.  Prayers for all the Carmelites out there would be great, and prayers for my friend Sr. Claire Benedicta of the Cross, O.C.D., would be especially welcome. Happy feast day to  urlLink  Flos Carmeli ,   urlLink Kathy the Carmelite , and any other Carmelite bloggers I may have missed !  If any readers are in the Pittsburgh area, the local Latin Mass Community over at St. Boniface is having a Triduum of Solemn High Masses in honor of St. Therese, whose feast is October 3 on the Tridentine calendar. I mention it because the Oratory's organist/choir director is in charge of the music, and my choir will be singing at the Mass on Friday evening at 7 pm.  A quote for the feast: "Once when shown a photograph of herself Teresa had said with a smile, 'Yes, that's the envelope. When will anyone see the letter inside? I should like to see that letter.'   Now at last she knew. That letter, inspired, worked over, and finished off by her Lord, was before Almighty God, and it seems that it was his will that its message should be at once spread throughout the face of the earth; the young warrior, victor over herself, was given the whole world in which to enlarge her conquests. From her brown scapular as from an apron she scattered roses like rain-not roses of paper or plaster or china or marble, but living ones, white or blood-red, roses of suffering and sacrifice and innocence (any self-respecting artist would hesitate at representing them); and in her hand she bore a banner with two devices, the smiling face of the Child and the agonized face of the Crucified. She did not call for a mawkish veneration, she did not put forward a soft and feeble example: everything was strong; she was of the stock of Catherine of Siena and Joan of Arc, and her 'little way' was an heroic way-nothing less than plenary love of God and total surrender to him down to the least thoughts and actions; to become as a little child is to put oneself through the mill.   Imitation flowers and sham simplicity, products of an emotionalism that becomes sheer sentimentality, ought to be stripped from the devotion accorded to one from whom God withheld sensible consolation for almost the whole of her life. The figure of the 'shower of roses' has served its turn, and served it well in winning over the many who have a taste for the romantical and pretty. But these 'roses' are in fact graces, and grace is not carried easily: for complete fruition it requires a martyrdom of the soul. "-  From  The Secret of the Little Flower  by Henri Ghéon

       Prayers are needed  for the  urlLink  health of the Holy Father.   "It is with these thoughts then, my Brethren, with these feelings of solemn expectation, of joyful confidence, that we now come before our God, and pray Him to have mercy on His chosen Servant, His own Vicar, in this hour of trial. We come to Him, like the prophet Daniel, in humiliation for our own sins and the sins of our kings, our princes, our fathers, and our people, in all parts of the Church; and therefore we say the  Miserere  and the Litany of the Saints as in a time of fast. And we come before Him in the bright and glad spirit of soldiers who know they are under the leading of an Invincible King, and wait with beating hearts to see what He is about to do; and therefore it is that we adorn our sanctuary, bringing out our hangings and multiplying our lights, as on a day of festival. We know well we are on the winning side, and that the prayers of the poor, the weak, and the despised, can do more, when offered in a true spirit, than all the wisdom and all the resources of the world.

        The Feast of St.Jerome, Priest and Doctor of the Church  is today. There is information on him  urlLink  here.  I admit, I've always liked St, Jerome- the fact that a man of his natural cantankerousness could become a saint means there's hope for me yet ! Here's a verse, courtesy of   urlLink Mark Shea , on the saint of the day....   THE THUNDERER    by Phyllis McGinley  "Gods angry man, His crotchety scholar Was Saint Jerome, The great name-caller Who cared not a dime For the laws of Libel And in his spare time Translated the Bible. Quick to disparage All joys but learning Jerome thought marriage Better than burning; But didnt like womans Painted cheeks; Didnt like Romans, Didnt like Greeks, Hated Pagans For their Pagan ways, Yet doted on Cicero all of his days. A born reformer, cross and gifted, He scolded mankind Sterner than Swift did; Worked to save The world from the heathen; Fled to a cave For peace to breathe in, Promptly wherewith For miles around He filled the air with Fury and sound. In a mighty prose For Almighty ends, He thrust at his foes, Quarreled with his friends, And served his Master, Though with complaint. He wasnt a plaster sort of a saint. But he swelled mens minds With a Christian leaven. It takes all kinds to make a heaven. "

       The good people over at DeoOmnisGloria.com   have seen fit to ask me  urlLink  a few questions.     Quenta Narwen Questions  Umm.. sorry to be picky, but the name of the blog is  Quenta N&acirc;rwenion  , as a parallel to the  Quenta Silmarillion . I understand that the circumflex might be a problem, but including the "ion" shouldn't be.    1) Personally, Im a huge fan of Tolkien (as are several other contributors to this blog), so naturally my first question comes from this position. When did you first read a Tolkien book, or basically, how were you introduced to Tolkien? As a side note, this post, Everything I need to know I learned from Tolkien, is great!  Side note on your side note: Thanks !  I first read  The Hobbit   at the age of eight. I believe my interest was piqued by that dreadful Rankin-Bass monstrosity of an 'adaptation', which had been broadcast on TV. (I was eight. I didn't have the kind of aesthetic equipment needed to be properly discriminating.)  I read   The Lord of the Rings  for the first time at the age of ten, and  The Silmarillion  at twelve. ( I think that timeframe may be why I have a bizarre tendency to associate  Silmarillion  stories with  urlLink 80's    urlLink music . Ah, well.... )  I read  The Lord of the Rings  and  The Silmarillion   at least once a year, and have frequently read  The Tolkien Reader ,  "Smith of Wooton Major", and  The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien . I have read, but do not yet own, the  History of Middle-earth  series.    2) I had to ask this question: Your blog classifies you as a Rat Fan. Can you explain?  Simple. I am a fan of rats- the domesticated pet ones, that is. While currently ratless due to financial issues, I am very fond of the little furballs and plan to get more when the job search is over. I am also an actual member of  urlLink The Rat Fan Club , founded by the  urlLink  Ratlady  herself, Debbie Ducommun.  Actually, my online name,  N&acirc;rwen, is Sindarin Elvish for "rat-maiden" !     3) I read your post 100 things about me and enjoyed it. But it didnt discuss what motivates an introvert to blog (besides a writing background). Would you like to let us in on how blogging fits into your view of life?  Well, blogging lets me share a lot of the great things I've come across with other people. It gives me a forum in which to request prayers as well. Perhaps the biggest ulterior motive is that it allows me to attempt to acquaint people with the Oratorian charism, our  urlLink  founder  and my favorite  urlLink  Cause.      4) Can you explain what a Secular Oratorian is? I couldnt find it in your blog (FYI- MovableType features a Search function).  Secular Oratorians are members of the laity who are trying to live the charism of the Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri . We are assisted in this, and in turn try to assist, the Fathers and Brothers of the said Congregation of the Oratory. To understand the Oratorian charism, (to a certain, limited extent, of course ! ) I would recommend checking out these posts on my sidebar: "St. Philip Neri: Parts One through Twelve", "The Pittsburgh Oratory", "Some Oratorian information (with emphasis on the official stuff) " , "And in Oratory News (includes the Litany of St. Philip Neri) " and "IT'S TOMMOROW (St. Philip Neri links)"  BTW, the Professor himself had an Oratorian connection. After his widowed mother had converted to Catholicism and brought her sons into the Church, she got to know Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan, C.O., of the Birmingham Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri. When she was diagnosed with diabetes (not a treatable condition at the turn of the 20th century) she made Fr. Morgan the guardian of her sons, since she could not trust her relatives, many of whom were hostile to the Faith, to raise her boys as Catholics. She died, after a lapse into a coma, when Tolkien was twelve. Fr. Morgan then took responsibility for her sons, and did his best to raise them- not an easy task for anybody, certainly not easy for a parish priest with many other duties, though he did have his community to support him. How well Fr. Morgan did may be judged by these two quotes written by the Professor late in his own life.  "And again, I remember after the death of Fr. Francis my 'second father' (at 77, in 1935), saying to C.S. Lewis, ' I feel like a lost survivor in a new alien world after the real world has passed away.' " "In 1904 we (Hilary (ed. Tolkien's brother) & I) had the sudden miraculous experience of Fr. Francis' love and care and humour..."     5) Who would you like to see as the next Pope (what were you expecting)?  Well, he was only just made a Cardinal, but I like what I've read and heard about George Pell...    I love the intermixing with Tolkien and Middle Earth, by the way and I've also added Quenta Narwen to our links list.    Thank you. But it's Middle-earth, not Middle Earth.

        The Feast of Sts. Michael, Gabriel and Raphael, Archangels  is today. There is information on them  urlLink  here  ,  urlLink here  , and  urlLink  here . Prayers for all those who have these mighty beings as patrons would be most appropriate. A blessed feast day to Fr. Michael of the Pittsburgh Oratory and to Michael of the Pittsburgh Secular Oratory !    St. Michael   (A Hymn.)  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.                   Thou champion high              Of Heaven's imperial Bride,          For ever waiting on her eye,      Before her onward path, and at her side,  In war her guard secure, by night her ready guide!                   To thee was given,              When those false angels rose          Against the Majesty of Heaven,      To hurl them down the steep, and on them close  The prison where they roam in hopeless unrepose.                   Thee, Michael, thee,              When sight and breathing fail,          The disembodied soul shall see;      The pardon'd soul with solemn joy shall hail,  When holiest rites are spent, and tears no more avail.                   And thou, at last,              When Time itself must die,          Shalt sound that dread and piercing blast,      To wake the dead, and rend the vaulted sky,  And summon all to meet the Omniscient Judge on high.    The Oratory. 1862.

        From "Preface to the Third Edition of  Lectures on the Prophetical Office of the Church- The Via Media"     by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   (ed. This preface is particularly interesting inasmuch as it shows the Venerable, as a Catholic, giving a critique of his own earlier work as an Anglican. )   "When our Lord went up on high, He left His representative behind Him. This was Holy Church, His mystical Body and Bride, a Divine Institution, and the shrine and organ of the Paraclete, who speaks through her till the end comes. She, to use an Anglican poet's words, is 'His very self below,' as far as men on earth are equal to the discharge and fulfilment of high offices, which primarily and supremely are His.   These offices, which specially belong to Him as Mediator, are commonly considered to be three; He is Prophet, Priest, and King; and after His pattern, and in human measure, Holy Church has a triple office too; not the Prophetical alone and in isolation, as these Lectures virtually teach, but three offices, which are indivisible, though diverse, viz. teaching, rule, and sacred ministry. This then is the point on which I shall now insist, the very title of the Lectures I am to criticize suggesting to me how best to criticize them.  I will but say in passing, that I must not in this argument be supposed to forget that the Pope, as the Vicar of Christ, inherits these offices and acts for the Church in them. This is another matter; I am speaking here of the Body of Christ, and the sovereign Pontiff would not be the visible head of that Body, did he not first belong to it. He is not himself the Body of Christ, but the chief part of the Body; I shall have quite opportunities enough in what is to come to show that I duly bear him in mind.  Christianity, then, is at once a philosophy, a political power, and a religious rite: as a religion, it is Holy; as a philosophy, it is Apostolic; as a political power, it is imperial, that is, One and Catholic. As a religion, its special centre of action is pastor and flock; as a philosophy, the Schools; as a rule, the Papacy and its Curia. "

        From the homily   Fr. Michael was the celebrant at the 10 am Mass. I was particularly intrigued by the fact that he was made a reference in his homily to...   The Lord of the Rings . After a note that the Professor was a devout Catholic and a mention of his Oratorian connections, he made the observation than, unlike many of the great quests of literature, in  The Lord of the Rings   the goal is not gain, but the casting out of evil. Similarly, as Our Lord states so forcefully in today's Gospel, anything which leads us into sin must be cast out of our lives,  now .

        For Saturday    " I consider it impossible then, for those who believe the Church to be one vast body in heaven and on earth, in which every holy creature of God has his place, and of which prayer is the life, when once they recognize the sanctity and dignity of the Blessed Virgin, not to perceive immediately, that her office above is one of perpetual intercession for the faithful militant, and that our very relation to her must be that of clients to a patron, and that, in the eternal enmity which exists between the woman and the serpent, while the serpent's strength lies in being the Tempter, the weapon of the Second Eve and Mother of God is prayer.  As then these ideas of her sanctity and dignity gradually penetrated the mind of Christendom, so did that of her intercessory power follow close upon them and with them. From the earliest times that mediation is symbolized in those representations of her with up-lifted hands, which, whether in plaster or in glass, are still extant in Rome,that Church, as St. Iren?us says, with which 'every Church, that is, the faithful from every side, must agree, because of its more powerful principality;' 'into which,' as Tertullian adds, 'the Apostles poured out, together with their blood, their whole doctrine.' As far indeed as existing documents are concerned, I know of no instance to my purpose earlier than A.D. 234, but it is a very remarkable one; and, though it has been often quoted in the controversy, an argument is not weaker for frequent use.  'St. Gregory Nyssen , then, a native of Cappadocia in the fourth century, relates that his namesake, Bishop of Neo-Caesarea in Pontus, surnamed Thaumaturgus, in the century preceding, shortly before he was called to the priesthood, received in a vision a Creed, which is still extant, from the Blessed Mary at the hands of St. John. The account runs thus:He was deeply pondering theological doctrine, which the heretics of the day depraved. 'In such thoughts,' says his namesake of Nyssa, 'he was passing the night, when one appeared, as if in human form, aged in appearance, saintly in the fashion of his garments, and very venerable both in grace of countenance and general mien. Amazed at the sight, he started from his bed, and asked who it was, and why he came; but, on the other calming the perturbation of his mind with his gentle voice, and saying he had appeared to him by divine command on account of his doubts, in order that the truth of the orthodox faith might be revealed to him, he took courage at the word, and regarded him with a mixture of joy and fright. Then, on his stretching his hand straight forward and pointing with his fingers at something on one side, he followed with his eyes the extended hand, and saw another appearance opposite to the former, in shape of a woman, but more than human ... When his eyes could not bear the apparition, he heard them conversing together on the subject of his doubts; and thereby not only gained a true knowledge of the faith, but learned their names, as they addressed each other by their respective appellations. And thus he is said to have heard the person in woman's shape bid "John the Evangelist" disclose to the young man the mystery of godliness; and he answered that he was ready to comply in this matter with the wish of "the Mother of the Lord," and enunciated a formulary, well-turned and complete, and so vanished. He, on the other hand, immediately committed to writing that divine teaching of his mystagogue, and henceforth preached in the Church according to that form, and bequeathed to posterity, as an inheritance, that heavenly teaching, by means of which his people are instructed down to this day, being preserved from all heretical evil." He proceeds to rehearse the Creed thus given, 'There is One God, Father of a Living Word,' &c. Bull (ed. an Anglican authority), after quoting it in his work on the Nicene Faith, alludes to this history of its origin, and adds, 'No one should think it incredible that such a providence should befall a man whose whole life was conspicuous for revelations and miracles, as all ecclesiastical writers who have mentioned him (and who has not?) witness with one voice.'   Here our Lady is represented as rescuing a holy soul from intellectual error. This leads me to a further reflection. You seem, in one place of your Volume, to object to the Antiphon, in which it is said of her, 'All heresies thou hast destroyed alone.' Surely the truth of it is verified in this age, as in former times, and especially by the doctrine concerning her, on which I have been dwelling. She is the great exemplar of prayer in a generation, which emphatically denies the power of prayer  in toto , which determines that fatal laws govern the universe, that there cannot be any direct communication between earth and heaven, that God cannot visit His own earth, and that man cannot influence His providence."- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   A Letter Addressed to the Rev. E. B. Pusey, D.D., on Occasion of His Eirenicon

       From  Discourses to Mixed Congregations   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. " Be convinced in your reason that the Catholic Church is a teacher sent to you from God, and it is enough. I do not wish you to join her, till you are. If you are half convinced, pray for a full conviction, and wait till you have it. It is better indeed to come quickly, but better slowly than carelessly; and sometimes, as the proverb goes, the more haste, the worse speed. Only make yourselves sure that the delay is not from any fault of yours, which you can remedy. God deals with us very differently; conviction comes slowly to some men, quickly to others; in some it is the result of much thought and many reasonings, in others of a sudden illumination. One man is convinced at once, as in the instance described by St. Paul: 'If all prophesy,' he says, speaking of exposition of doctrine, 'and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all. The secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God, and say that God is among you of a truth.' The case is the same now; some men are converted merely by entering a Catholic Church; others are converted by reading one book; others by one doctrine. They feel the weight of their sins, and they see that that religion must come from God which alone has the means of forgiving them. Or they are touched and overcome by the evident sanctity, beauty, and (as I may say) fragrance of the Catholic Religion.Or they long for a guide amid the strife of tongues; and the very doctrine of the Church about faith, which is so hard to many, is conviction to them. Others, again, hear many objections to the Church, and follow out the whole subject far and wide; conviction can scarcely come to them except as at the end of a long inquiry. As in a court of justice, one man's innocence may be proved at once, another's is the result of a careful investigation; one has nothing in his conduct or character to explain, against another there are many unfavourable presumptions at first sight; so Holy Church presents herself very differently to different minds who are contemplating her from without. God deals with them differently; but, if they are faithful to their light, at last, in their own time, though it may be a different time to each, He brings them to that one and the same state of mind, very definite and not to be mistaken, which we call  conviction . They will have no doubt, whatever difficulties may still attach to the subject, that the Church is from God; they may not be able to answer this objection or that, but they will be certain in spite of it.

       On this date, 158 years ago...  Venerable John Henry Newman was received into the Catholic Church, at the hands of  urlLink Blessed Dominic Barberi, C.P. . Thanks to  urlLink  Gerard Serafin ,   urlLink  Lane Core , and to any other bloggers who have noted this anniversary. ( Congratulations to Lane Core on it being his own anniversary of reception into the Church as well.)  Here is the conclusion  of   An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine , the book in which the Venerable cleared up his own difficulties with the Catholic Faith.    "Such were the thoughts concerning the 'Blessed Vision of Peace,' of one whose long-continued petition had been that the Most Merciful would not despise the work of His own Hands, nor leave him to himself;while yet his eyes were dim, and his breast laden, and he could but employ Reason in the things of Faith. And now, dear Reader, time is short, eternity is long. Put not from you what you have here found; regard it not as mere matter of present controversy; set not out resolved to refute it, and looking about for the best way of doing so; seduce not yourself with the imagination that it comes of disappointment, or disgust, or restlessness, or wounded feeling, or undue sensibility, or other weakness. Wrap not yourself round in the associations of years past, nor determine that to be truth which you wish to be so, nor make an idol of cherished anticipations. Time is short, eternity is long.     Nunc dimittis servum tuum Domine,  Secundum verbum tuum in pace  Quia viderunt oculi mei salutare tuum.  "

       On October 8, 1845...   Venerable John Henry Newman spent much of the day writing letters which ran like this: "Littlemore, October 8th, 1845. I am this night expecting Father Dominic, the Passionist, who, from his youth, has been led to have distinct and direct thoughts, first of the countries of the North, then of England. After thirty years' (almost) waiting, he was without his own act sent here. But he has had little to do with conversions. I saw him here for a few minutes on St. John Baptist's day last year. He is a simple, holy man; and withal gifted with remarkable powers. He does not know of my intention; but I mean to ask of him admission into the one  Fold of Christ I have so many letters to write, that this must do for all who choose to ask about me. With my best love to dear Charles Marriott, who is over your head, &c., &c.  P.S. This will not go till all is over. Of course it requires no answer."

       The Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary  is today. In honor of this, here is a  urlLink  link  to information on the Rosary at the website of the Holy See.   "You know that today we keep the Feast of the Holy Rosary, and I propose to say to you what occurs to me on this great subject. You know how that devotion came about; how, at a time when heresy was very widespread, and had called in the aid of sophistry, that can so powerfully aid infidelity against religion, God inspired St. Dominic to institute and spread this devotion. It seems so simple and easy, but you know God chooses the small things of the world to humble the great. Of course it was first of all for the poor and simple, but not for them only, for everyone who has practised the devotion knows that there is in it a soothing sweetness that there is in nothing else. It is difficult to know God by our own power, because He is incomprehensible. He is invisible to begin with, and therefore incomprehensible. We can in some way know him, for even among the heathens there were some who had learned many truths about Him; but even they found it hard to conform their lives to their knowledge of Him. And so in His mercy He has given us a revelation of Himself by coming amongst us, to be one of ourselves, with all the relations and qualities of humanity, to gain us over. He came down from Heaven and dwelt amongst us, and died for us. All these things are in the Creed, which contains the chief things that He has revealed to us about Himself. Now the great power of the Rosary lies in this, that it makes the Creed into a prayer; of course, the Creed is in some sense a prayer and a great act of homage to God; but the Rosary gives us the great truths of His life and death to meditate upon, and brings them nearer to our hearts. And so we contemplate all the great mysteries of His life and His birth in the manger; and so too the mysteries of His suffering and His glorified life. But even Christians, with all their knowledge of God, have usually more awe than love of Him, and the special virtue of the Rosary lies in the special way in which it looks at these mysteries; for with all our thoughts of Him are mingled thoughts of His Mother, and in the relations between Mother and Son we have set before us the Holy Family, the home in which God lived. Now the family is, even humanly considered, a sacred thing; how much more the family bound together by supernatural ties, and, above all, that in which God dwelt with His Blessed Mother." - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

       From  Essays Critical and Historical    "A convert is undeniably in favour with no party; he is looked at with distrust, contempt, and aversion by all. His former friends think him a good riddance, and his new friends are cold and strange; and as to the impartial public, their very first impulse is to impute the change to some eccentricity of character, or fickleness of mind, or tender attachment, or private interest. Their utmost praise is the reluctant confession that 'doubtless he is very sincere.' " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

        For Saturday  From "On the Fitness of the Glories of Mary" in   Discourses to Mixed Congregations  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Such, then, is the truth ever cherished in the deep heart of the Church, and witnessed by the keen apprehension of her children, that no limits but those proper to a creature can be assigned to the sanctity of Mary. Therefore, did Abraham believe that a son should be born to him of his aged wife? then Mary's faith must be held as greater when she accepted Gabriel's message. Did Judith consecrate her widowhood to God to the surprise of her people? much more did Mary, from her first youth, devote her virginity. Did Samuel, when a child, inhabit the Temple, secluded from the world? Mary too was by her parents lodged in the same holy precincts, even at the age when children first can choose between good and evil. Was Solomon on his birth called 'dear to the Lord'? and shall not the destined Mother of God be dear to Him from the moment she was born? But further still; St. John Baptist was sanctified by the Spirit before his birth; shall Mary be only equal to him? is it not fitting that her privilege should surpass his? is it wonderful, if grace, which anticipated his birth by three months, should in her case run up to the very first moment of her being, outstrip the imputation of sin, and be beforehand with the usurpation of Satan? Mary must surpass all the saints; the very fact that certain privileges are known to have been theirs persuades us, almost from the necessity of the case, that she had the same and higher. Her conception was immaculate, in order that she might surpass all saints in the date as well as the fulness of her sanctification. "

       Happy Blogoversary   to me !   Here's a copy of my first post, made a year ago today:   I, Donna Marie Lewis, with firm faith believe and profess everything that is contained in the symbol of faith: namely,   I believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation He came down from heaven: By the power of the Holy Spirit, He was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died and was buried. On the third day He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and His kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son He is worshipped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. I believe in the one, holy, Catholic and apostolic church. I acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.  With firm faith I believe as well everything contained in God's word, written or handed down in tradition and proposed by the church--whether in solemn judgment or in the ordinary and universal magisterium--as divinely revealed and called for faith.  I also firmly accept and hold each and every thing that is proposed by that same church definitively with regard to teaching concerning faith or morals.  What is more, I adhere with religious submission of will and intellect to the teachings which either the Roman pontiff or the college of bishops enunciate when they exercise the authentic magisterium even if they proclaim those teachings in an act that is not definitive.  :: Nârwen 5:53 PM [+] ::

        Blessed Anniversary, Holy Father !   "O Emmanuel, God with us, who art the Light that enlighteneth all men, who from the time when Thou camest upon earth, hast never left it to itself, who, after teaching Thy Apostles, gave them to teach others to succeed them, and didst especially leave St. Peter and his successors, Bishops of Rome, to take Thy place towards us, and to guide and rule us in Thy stead age after age, till the end come; Thou hast sent grievous trials for many years upon the Holy See of Rome. We believe and confess, O Lord, without any hesitation at all, that Thou hast promised a continuous duration to Thy Church while the world lastsand we confess before Thee, that we are in no doubt or trouble whatever, we have not a shadow of misgiving as to the permanence and the spiritual well-being either of Thy Church itself or of its rulers. Nor do we know what is best for Thy Church, and for the interests of the Catholic faith, and for the Pope, or the bishops throughout the world at this time. We leave the event entirely to Thee; we do so without any anxiety, knowing that everything must turn to the prosperity of Thy ransomed possession, even though things may look threatening for a season. Only we earnestly entreat that Thou wouldest give Thy own servant and representative, the Pope, true wisdom and courage, and fortitude, and the consolations of Thy grace in this life, and a glorious immortal crown in the life to come.

       Notes from a sermon preached on October 13, 1872..   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Forgiveness of Injuries 1. INTROD.Today's gospel [the king taking an account of his servants].  2. Parallel passages;  Luke xvii. 3-4  .  3. So far easy, for it is scarcely supposable that one should have so little generosity as to refuse forgiveness to one who confessed himself wrong and asked to be forgiven.  4. But when he does not ask to be forgiven; if he persists in opposition and injury, and goes on doing harm, and takes a wrong course. Yet this commanded too. The Lord's Prayer Matt. vi. 14-15  ,  Mark xi. 25-26  [,  Rom. xii. [18-20]  .  5. Or again, supposing he does not do so, asks to make it up, still there may be, you may say, such difficulties as these: I may wish to keep at a distance, for:  6. (1) E.g. I cannot trust him; he is a dangerous man.  7. (2) He is likely to do me spiritual harm.  8. (3) The sight of him is a temptation, an irritation to me; we shall be best friends at a distance.  9. (4) I shall be a hypocrite if I make it up, for I don't like his doings.  10. (5) I ought to protest against him.  11. ANSWER. 'If you in your hearts forgive not  every one his brother'  [ Matt. xviii. 35 ]. You must love him.  Col. iii. 12-13  ;  Matt. v. 44-47 .   12. OBJECTION.'But I do not like him.' How can I love him?  This  is a fundamental difficulty.  13. ANSWER.Can you pray that you may meet him and love him in heaven? You and he are both far from what you should be; and each has to  change . Look on the  best  part of his characterlearn sympathy with him. Think how he suffers. Purgatory useful for thisto bring you and him nearer to each other. "

       The Bondage of Sin  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   1. Thou, O my Lord and God, Thou alone art strong, Thou alone holy! Thou art the  Sanctus Deus, Sanctus fortis "Holy God, holy and strong!" Thou art the sanctity and the strength of all things. No created nature has any stay or subsistence in itself, but crumbles and melts away, if Thou art not with it, to sustain it. My God, Thou art the strength of the Angels, of the Saints in gloryof holy men on earth. No being has any sanctity or any strength apart from Thee. My God, I wish to adore Thee as such. I wish with all my heart to understand and to confess this great truth, that not only Thou art Almighty, but that there is no might at all, or power, or strength, anywhere but in Thee.  2. My God, if Thou art the strength of all spirits, O how pre-eminently art Thou my strength! O how true it is, so that nothing is more so, that I have no strength but in Thee! I feel intimately, O my God, that, whenever I am left to myself, I go wrong. As sure as a stone falls down to the earth if it be let go, so surely my heart and spirit fall down hopelessly if they are let go by Thee. Thou must uphold me by Thy right hand, or I cannot stand. How strange it is, but how true, that all my natural tendencies are towards sloth, towards excess, towards neglect of religion, towards neglect of prayer, towards love of the world, not towards love of Thee, or love of sanctity, or love of self-governance. I approve and praise what I do not do. My heart runs after vanities, and I tend to death, I tend to corruption and dissolution, apart from Thee,  Deus immortalis .  3. My God, I have had experience enough what a dreadful bondage sin is. If Thou art away, I find I cannot keep myself, however I wish itand am in the hands of my own self-will, pride, sensuality, and selfishness. And they prevail with me more and more every day, till they are irresistible. In time the old Adam within me gets so strong, that I become a mere slave. I confess things to be wrong which nevertheless I do. I bitterly lament over my bondage, but I cannot undo it. O what a tyranny is sin! It is a heavy weight which cripples meand what will be the end of it? By Thy all-precious merits, by Thy Almighty power, I intreat Thee, O my Lord, to give me life and sanctity and strength!  Deus sanctus , give me holiness;  Deus fortis , give me strength;  Deus immortalis , give me perseverance.  Sanctus Deus, Sanctus fortis, Sanctus immortalis, miserere nobis .

       For Saturday   "In Jesus Christ is the fulness of the Godhead with all its infinite sanctity. In Mary is reflected the sanctity of Jesus, as by His grace it could be found in a creature.  Mary, as the pattern both of maidenhood and maternity, has exalted womans state and nature, and made the Christian virgin and the Christian mother understand the sacredness of their duties in the sight of God.  Her very image is as a book in which we may read at a glance the mystery of the Incarnation, and the mercy of the Redemption; and withal her own gracious perfections also, who was made by her Divine Son the very type of humility, gentleness, fortitude, purity, patience, love.  What Christian mother can look upon her image and not be moved to pray for gentleness, watchfulness, and obedience like Marys? What Christian maiden can look upon her without praying for the gifts of simplicity, modesty, purity, recollection, gentleness such as hers?  Who can repeat her very name without finding in it a music which goes to the heart, and brings before him thoughts of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven above, and fills him with the desire of those graces by which heaven is gained?  Hail then, great Mother of God, Queen of Saints, Royal Lady clothed with the sun and crowned with the stars of heaven, whom all generations have called and shall call blessed. We will take our part in praising thee in our own time and place with all the redeemed of our Lord, and will exalt thee in the full assembly of the saints and glorify thee in the Heavenly Jerusalem.

        Today I spotted something while I was driving by a local Catholic parish   There was a display on its lawn of many, many white crosses to commemerate the babies who are legally killed in the womb in this country. However, I could not read on the accompanying sign the details of how many crosses there were, or how many lives lost each represented, for someone had defaced the words with spray paint. However, the words were not simply blacked out, nor covered with obscene replacements (as I have seen happen before). Over the entire sign, there were three huge circles, each with the slanting 'eliminate' line inside. It was somehow appropriate. After all, the babies are eliminated- why should we not expect attempts to tell the truth about our society's murderousness to be eliminated too ?

        From "Jeremiah, a Lesson for the Disappointed"  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "If we would gain true bliss, we must cease to seek it as an end; we must postpone the prospect of enjoying it. For we are by nature in an unnatural state; we must be changed from what we are when born, before we can receive our greatest good. And as in sickness sharp remedies are often used, or irksome treatment, so it is with our souls; we must go through pain, we must practise self-denial, we must curb our wills, and purify our hearts, before we are capable of any lasting solid peace. To attempt to gain happiness, except in this apparently tedious and circuitous way, is a labour lost; it is building on the sand; the foundation will soon give way, though the house looks fair for a time.

        Notes from a sermon preached October 20th, 1872  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "[Final Perseverance] 1. INTROD.Epistle for the day, perseverance in grace.  2. Two things plain: (1) perseverance necessary,  Matt. xxiv. 13, Ezech. xxxiii. 18  .  3. (2) Not in our power, but a special gift of God. We cannot merit it.  4. Now what is merit? (Explain.) By ourselves not only not perseverance, but nothing can we merit.  5. Because (1) by ourselves we can do nothing pleasing to God, because of our sinfulness; and (2) because how can anything we do be worthy of heaven? what proportion?  Luke xvii. 7-10  .  6. (1) Therefore the grace of God, and (2) His promise; thus we can be said, first, to please God, and secondly, to merit.  7. And these two by the merits of our Lord and Saviour.  8. But there are two things we cannot meritthe first grace and the last.  9. As to the first grace, it is plainly God's free bounty which has made us Christians.  10. As to the last, it is God's free bounty, in spite of the accumulation of merits. No extent of merit is sufficient to gain perseverancethe just may fall, however holy, etc. Think of Solomon; think of Judas. It is a special gift to die in grace.  11. Two conclusions. First let us continually pray that God would give us this special gift of dying in grace.  12. This may comfort us when we lose our friends, that God may in His mercy have taken them then, when they were in grace. "

       Hear all ye peoples of Arda !  On this date, in the year 1955, the final volume of  The Lord of the Rings ,  The Return of the King , was published, to the general rejoicing of all those who had been traumatized by the cruel cliffhanger at the end of  The Two Towers .  Truly an anniversary to remember !

        I believe I read somewhere....  that Blessed Teresa of Calcutta was very fond of the following prayer:  "Dear Jesus, help me to spread Thy fragrance everywhere I go. Flood my soul with Thy Spirit and Life. Penetrate and possess my whole being so utterly that my life may be only a radiance of Thine. Shine through me and be so in me that every soul I come in contact with may feel Thy presence in my soul. Let them look up, and see no longer me, but only Jesus! Stay with me, and then I shall begin to shine as Thou shinest: so to shine as to be a light to others. The light, O Jesus, will be all from Thee. None of it will be mine. No merit to me. It will be Thou who shinest through me upon others. O let me thus praise Thee, in the way which Thou dost love best, by shining on all those around me. Give light to them as well as to me; light them with me, through me. Teach me to show forth Thy praise, Thy truth, Thy will. Make me preach Thee without preachingnot by words, but by my example and by the catching force, the sympathetic influence, of what I doby my visible resemblance to Thy saints, and the evident fulness of the love which my heart bears to Thee. " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

        If it were not Sunday....  today would be the feast of several interesting saints. First off,  urlLink the North American Martyrs , men of incredible courage and faith. Also  urlLink  St. Philip Howard , one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. BTW, while some maintain that he died of natural causes, as stated in the biography linked, others maintain that he was poisoned to death. Finally, there is  urlLink  St. Paul of the Cross, C.P.,  Priest and Founder  . A blessed feast day to any Passionists out there ! Oratorians, particularly those in the English-speaking countries, owe a debt to the Passionists, as it was  urlLink one of their number  who brought our own Venerable Newman into the Church.

        From "Intellect, the Instrument of Religious Training  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " Here, then, I conceive, is the object of the Holy See and the Catholic Church in setting up Universities; it is to reunite things which were in the beginning joined together by God, and have been put asunder by man. Some persons will say that I am thinking of confining, distorting, and stunting the growth of the intellect by ecclesiastical supervision. I have no such thought. Nor have I any thought of a compromise, as if religion must give up something, and science something. I wish the intellect to range with the utmost freedom, and religion to enjoy an equal freedom; but what I am stipulating for is, that they should be found in one and the same place, and exemplified in the same persons. I want to destroy that diversity of centres, which puts everything into confusion by creating a contrariety of influences. I wish the same spots and the same individuals to be at once oracles of philosophy and shrines of devotion. It will not satisfy me, what satisfies so many, to have two independent systems, intellectual and religious, going at once side by side, by a sort of division of labour, and only accidentally brought together. It will not satisfy me, if religion is here, and science there, and young men converse with science all day, and lodge with religion in the evening. It is not touching the evil, to which these remarks have been directed, if young men eat and drink and sleep in one place, and think in another: I want the same roof to contain both the intellectual and moral discipline. Devotion is not a sort of finish given to the sciences; nor is science a sort of feather in the cap, if I may so express myself, an ornament and set-off to devotion. I want the intellectual layman to be religious, and the devout ecclesiastic to be intellectual. "    Sermons Preached on Various Occasions

       VespersMonday   Translated by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.     Immense cli conditor.        "Lord of unbounded space,          Who, lest the sky and main  Should mix, and heaven should lose its place,          Didst the rude waters chain;       Parting the moist and rare,          That rills on earth might flow  To soothe the angry flame, whene'er          It ravens from below;       Pour on us of Thy grace          The everlasting spring;  Lest our frail steps renew the trace          Of the ancient wandering.       May faith in lustre grow,          And rear her star in heaven,  Paling all sparks of earth below,          Unquench'd by damps of even.       Grant it, O Father, Son,          And Holy Spirit of grace,  To whom be glory, Three in One,          In every time and place. "

       A prophetic passage  from   Discourses to Mixed Congregations , by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "Wealth is one idol of the day, and notoriety is a second. I am not speaking, I repeat, of what men actually pursue, but of what they look up to, what they revere. Men may not have the opportunity of pursuing what they admire still. Never could notoriety exist as it does now, in any former age of the world; now that the news of the hour from all parts of the world, private news as well as public, is brought day by day to every individual, as I may say, of the community, to the poorest artisan and the most secluded peasant, by processes so uniform, so unvarying, so spontaneous, that they almost bear the semblance of a natural law. And hence notoriety, or the making a noise in the world, has come to be considered a great good in itself, and a ground of veneration. Time was when men could only make a display by means of expenditure; and the world used to gaze with wonder on those who had large establishments, many servants, many horses, richly-furnished houses, gardens, and parks: it does so still, that is, when it has the opportunity of doing so: for such magnificence is the fortune of the few, and comparatively few are its witnesses. Notoriety, or, as it may be called, newspaper fame, is to the many what style and fashion, to use the language of the world, are to those who are within or belong to the higher circles; it becomes to them a sort of idol, worshipped for its own sake, and without any reference to the shape in which it comes before them. It may be an evil fame or a good fame; it may be the notoriety of a great statesman, or of a great preacher, or of a great speculator, or of a great experimentalist, or of a great criminal; of one who has laboured in the improvement of our schools, or hospitals, or prisons, or workhouses, or of one who has robbed his neighbour of his wife. It matters not; so that a man is talked much of, and read much of, he is thought much of; nay, let him even have died justly under the hands of the law, still he will be made a sort of martyr of. His clothes, his handwriting, the circumstances of his guilt, the instruments of his deed of blood, will be shown about, gazed on, treasured up as so many relics; for the question with men is, not whether he is great, or good, or wise, or holy; not whether he is base, and vile, and odious, but whether he is in the mouths of men, whether he has centred on himself the attention of many, whether he has done something out of the way, whether he has been (as it were) canonised in the publications of the hour. All men cannot be notorious: the multitudes who thus honour notoriety, do not seek it themselves; nor am I speaking of what men do, but how they judge; yet instances do occur from time to time of wretched men, so smitten with passion for notoriety, as even to dare in fact some detestable and wanton act, not from love of it, not from liking or dislike of the person against whom it is directed, but simply in order thereby to gratify this impure desire of being talked about, and gazed upon. 'These are thy gods, O Israel!' Alas! Alas! this great and noble people, born to aspire, born for reverence, behold them walking to and fro by the torchlight of the cavern, or pursuing the wildfires of the marsh, not understanding themselves, their destinies, their defilements, their needs, because they have not the glorious luminaries of heaven to see, to consult, and to admire!

        A special "From the homily"   This is not from today's homily. I am, with Fr. Bryan's kind permission, blogging a pro-life story which I have heard him speak of in several homilies and talks over the years.   The story begins in Canada, over sixty years ago, with a young married couple there. Both of them were devout Presbyterians.  They had two children, the elder a boy, the younger a girl. However, the girl's birth had been extremely difficult for her mother, due to a severe case of toxemia.  It was so severe that the mother almost died. The mother's family also had a history of early deaths due to heart problems. Given this medical background, the mother's physician warned her that having any more children would put her in great danger, and quite probably kill her.   Nevertheless, three years later, she found herself to be pregnant again. The doctor immediately recommended that she abort the child, and offered to make whatever arrangements, legal or illegal, would be necessary. She refused, insisting that she knew that she, and her baby, would both survive. Her husband, though worried, supported her in her decision.  She turned out to be absolutely right. Not only did mother and child both live, but the delivery was far easier than the births of either her first or second baby. This time, she gave birth to a little boy. This boy then grew up, and and, as an adult, became Catholic (rather to his family's distress).   "And that" said Fr. Bryan," is why you are getting to hear this story- because that baby was me. "    This bit of personal history from a priest for whom I have great respect and affection is, for me, chilling. That Fr. Bryan, who celebrated his 31st anniversary in the priesthood last June, would, if his mother and father had not had the courage to ignore 'expert opinion', have been ripped apart before he got a chance to take his first breath, makes me wince. Now, babies, babies as living and as human as Fr. Bryan and as you and me, are being slaughtered, not because the mother's life is as risk, but because she just doesn't want a child, or her boyfriend is pressuring her, or she has been lied to by some 'counselor' who assures her that it is simple and painless and it will just make the whole problem go away. The quiet deaths go on, thousands of times a day, all over the world.

       This Sunday has been designated 'Priesthood Sunday'  Unfortunately, I am unable to link to the website listed in my diocesan paper, since it seems to contain some,  ahem , questionable material, and even more questionable links. ( No site that links to something called "FutureChurch" is getting a plug from me, thank you.) However, prayer for, and giving thanks for, all the faithful priests out there is always a good thing, no matter what day it is. In my case, I am blessed that there are five wonderful priests here at the Pittsburgh Oratory. Fr. David, Fr. Bryan, Fr. Drew, Fr. Joseph, Fr. Michael- you are always in my prayers and I thank God for you every day.

       For Saturday  From "Our Lady in the Gospel" by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " The Holy Fathers have ever gathered the exact obedience and the sinlessness of the Blessed Virgin from the very narrative of the Annunciation, when she became the Mother of God. For when the Angel appeared to her and declared to her the will of God, they say that she displayed especially four graces, humility, faith, obedience and purity. Nay, these graces were as it were, preparatory conditions to her being made the minister of so high a dispensation. So that if she had not had faith, and humility, and purity, and obedience, she would not have merited to be God's Mother. Thus it is common to say that she conceived Christ in mind before she conceived Him in body, meaning that the blessedness of faith and obedience preceded the blessedness of being a Virgin Mother. Nay, they even say that God waited for her consent before He came into her and took flesh of her. Just as He did no mighty works in one place because they had not faith, so this great miracle, by which He became the Son of a creature, was suspended till she was tried and found meet for ittill she obeyed.

As I have mentioned  urlLink  before , St. Charles and my own patron St. Philip Neri were friends. The biography  Philip Neri: The Fire of Joy , by the late Fr. Paul T&uuml;rks, C.O., actually has a chapter called "Charles Borromeo and the Oratory". Though they were good friends and each had a great regard for the other's holiness, they had some sharp disagreements- mostly because St. Charles, like any good bishop, tried to get some of the best priests and young men considering the priesthood to come to his Archdiocese of Milan. The conflict came because some of these men he was attempting to recruit were already part of the nascent Congregation of the Oratory.   In an surviving, unsent draft of a letter, St. Philip somewhat jokingly called St. Charles  ma ladra - a thief !

       From "The Dream of Gerontius"  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  " ANGEL.    Now let the golden prison ope its gates,  Making sweet music, as each fold revolves  Upon its ready hinge. And ye, great powers,  Angels of Purgatory, receive from me  My charge, a precious soul, until the day,  When, from all bond and forfeiture released,  I shall reclaim it for the courts of light.   SOULS IN PURGATORY.    1. Lord, Thou hast been our refuge: in every         generation;   2. Before the hills were born, and the world was:         from age to age Thou art God.   3. Bring us not, Lord, very low: for Thou hast said,         Come back again, ye sons of Adam.   4. A thousand years before Thine eyes are but as         yesterday: and as a watch of the night which         is come and gone.   5. The grass springs up in the morning: at evening         tide it shrivels up and dies.   6. So we fail in Thine anger: and in Thy wrath are         we troubled.   7. Thou hast set our sins in Thy sight: and our         round of days in the light of Thy countenance.   8. Come back, O Lord! how long: and be entreated         for Thy servants.   9. In Thy morning we shall be filled with Thy         mercy: we shall rejoice and be in pleasure all         our days.   10. We shall be glad according to the days of our         humiliation: and the years in which we have         seen evil.   11. Look, O Lord, Upon Thy servants and on Thy         work: and direct their children.   12. And let the beauty of the Lord our God be         upon us: and the work of our hands, establish         Thou it.   Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost.  As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:  world without end. Amen.    ANGEL.    Softly and gently, dearly-ransom'd soul,         In my most loving arms I now enfold thee,  And, o'er the penal waters, as they roll,         I poise thee, and I lower thee, and hold thee.   And carefully I dip thee in the lake,         And thou, without a sob or a resistance,  Dost through the flood thy rapid passage take,         Sinking deep, deeper, into the dim distance.   Angels, to whom the willing task is given,         Shall tend, and nurse, and lull thee, as thou liest;  And Masses on the earth, and prayers in heaven,   Shall aid thee at the Throne of the Most Highest.   Farewell, but not for ever! brother dear,         Be brave and patient on thy bed of sorrow;  Swiftly shall pass thy night of trial here,         And I will come and wake thee on the morrow. "   The Oratory. January, 1865.

       In case anyone is wondering..  the wedding yesterday was lovely. What I remember from the homily was Fr. Joseph stressing that matrimony, just like the other sacraments, is meant to bring those who participate in it to holiness, to make them saints.  The reception was a lot of fun, both for what it omitted and what it included. It omitted the always embarassing throwings of the bouquet and the garter ( a definite plus ! ) It included an open microphone during the luncheon, at which people could tell various stories about the new couple- and the ones we heard were both touching and funny. ( In lieu of a story, I sang "Ubi Caritas" for them- which, as it turns out, happens to be a favorite of the bride !) Instead of the usual DJ, friends of the couple provided the music. Here is the list:  Piano : Mr Richard Greco Accordions: Mrs. Anne Principe and Mr. Randal Koslosky Irish Bodhr&aacute;n: Mr. William Schneiderman Irish Fiddle: Mr. Peter Schovlin, Sr. Bagpipes: Br. Gregory Montagna, O.S.B.   Something tells me that not many wedding receptions have Latin chant and a Benedictine with bagpipes.... Anyhow, the happy couple attended the 11:30 am Mass today, and then left for the airport. They are honeymooning in Rome- complete with attendance at the periodic newlyweds audience with the Holy Father. Prayers for Brenda and Rob, both for their safe travel and for their marriage, would be most welcome.  After the reception, my friend Patty and I met up with our friends Godfrey and Alison, who had come to town from Baltimore for the wedding. They were married themselves in August, but they just got back from their own honeymoon- they had delayed their trip to Rome so that it would coincide with the beatification of Mother Teresa. (Godfrey's aunt is a Missionary of Charity, so they managed to get some excellent seats.) Godfrey showed Alison some of the local sights,such as the spectacular view of the city from Mt. Washington, and we all enjoyed both a good dinner and good conversation. All in all, an exciting, busy (and tiring)  day....

        At Mass today...  I liked the fact that in the petitions that we not only prayed for the poor souls , but also thanked God for His great mercy as shown forth in Purgatory.   Here's a quote from Msgr. Ronald Knox. He is talking about the descent of Christ to the dead.   "And with His coming a new hope came to the souls in Purgatory and has remained there ever since. They were souls bound for heaven. What light, what rest was given to them when our Lord came and told them that! If you and I go to Purgatory, we may have much to suffer there, but it will not be a place of despair or of doubt. We shall be able to say,  Descendit ad inferos ; Jesus Christ has been here, and he has made a door in this prison house through which, not now but later on, I shall follow Him to heaven. "  And from  The Catechism of the Catholic Church :  958  Communion with the dead.  "In full consciousness of this communion of the whole Mystical Body of Jesus Christ, the Church in its pilgrim members, from the very earliest days of the Christian religion, has honored with great respect the memory of the dead; and 'because it is a holy and a wholesome thought to pray for the dead that they may be loosed from their sins' she offers her suffrages for them. Our prayer for them is capable not only of helping them, but also of making their intercession for us effective.   959  In the one family of God.  For if we continue to love one another and to join in praising the Most Holy Trinity - all of us who are sons of God and form one family in Christ - we will be faithful to the deepest vocation of the Church."

        For Saturday  "If one drop of corruption makes the purest water worthless, as the slightest savour of bitterness spoils the most delicate viands, how can it be that the word of truth and holiness can proceed profitably from impure lips and an earthly heart? No; as is the tree, so is the fruit; 'beware of false prophets,' says our Lord; and then He adds, 'from their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?' Is it not so, my brethren? which of you would go to ask counsel of another, however learned, however gifted, however aged, if you thought him unholy? nay, though you feel and are sure, as far as absolution goes, that a bad priest could give it as really as a holy priest, yet for advice, for comfort, for instruction, you would not go to one whom you did not respect. 'Out of the abundance of the heart, mouth speaketh;' 'a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil'.  So then is it in the case of the soul; but, as regards the Blessed Mary, a further thought suggests itself. She has no chance place in the Divine Dispensation; the Word of God did not merely come to her and go from her; He did not pass through her, as He visits us in Holy Communion. It was no heavenly body which the Eternal Son assumed, fashioned by the angels, and brought down to this lower world: no; He imbibed, He absorbed into His Divine Person, her blood and the substance of her flesh; by becoming man of her, He received her lineaments and features, as the appropriate character in which He was to manifest Himself to mankind. The child is like the parent, and we may well suppose that by His likeness to her was manifested her relationship to Him. Her sanctity comes, not only of her being His mother, but also of His being her son. 'If the first fruit be holy,' says St. Paul, 'the mass also is holy; if the mass be holy, so are the branches.' And hence the titles which we are accustomed to give her. He is the Wisdom of God, she therefore is the Seat of Wisdom; His Presence is Heaven, she therefore is the Gate of Heaven; He is infinite Mercy, she then is the Mother of Mercy. She is the Mother of 'fair love and fear, and knowledge and holy hope'; is it wonderful then that she has left behind her in the Church below 'an odour like cinnamon and balm, and sweetness like to choice myrrh'?" - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. , "On the Fitness of the Glories of Mary",  Discourses to Mixed Congregations

       For Friday  " 1. His bodily pains were greater than those of any martyr, because He willed them to be greater. All pain of body depends, as to be felt at all, so to be felt in this or that degree, on the nature of the living mind which dwells in that body. Vegetables have no feeling because they have no living mind or spirit within them. Brute animals feel more or less according to the intelligence within them. Man feels more than any brute, because he has a soul; Christ's soul felt more than that of any other man, because His soul was exalted by personal union with the Word of God. Christ felt bodily pain more keenly than any other man, as much as man feels pain more keenly than any other animal.  2. It is a relief to pain to have the thoughts drawn another way. Thus, soldiers in battle often do not know when they are wounded. Again, persons in raging fevers seem to suffer a great deal; then afterwards they can but recollect general discomfort and restlessness. And so excitement and enthusiasm are great alleviations of bodily pain; thus savages die at the stake amid torments singing songs; it is a sort of mental drunkenness. And so again, an instantaneous pain is comparatively bearable; it is the continuance of pain which is so heavy, and if we had no memory of the pain we suffered last minute, and also suffer in the present, we should find pain easy to bear; but what makes the second pang grievous is because there has been a first pang; and what makes the third more grievous is that there has been a first and second; the pain seems to grow because it is prolonged. Now Christ suffered, not as in a delirium or in excitement, or in inadvertency, but He looked pain in the face! He offered His whole mind to it, and received it, as it were, directly into His bosom, and suffered all He suffered with a full consciousness of suffering.  3. Christ would not drink the drugged cup which was offered to Him to cloud His mind. He willed to have the full sense of pain. His soul was so intently fixed on His suffering as not to be distracted from it; and it was so active, and recollected the past and anticipated the future, and the whole passion was, as it were, concentrated on each moment of it, and all that He had suffered and all that He was to suffer lent its aid to increase what He was suffering. Yet withal His soul was so calm and sober and unexcited as to be passive, and thus to receive the full burden of the pain on it, without the power of throwing it off Him. Moreover, the sense of conscious innocence, and the knowledge that His sufferings would come to an end, might have supported Him; but He repressed the comfort and turned away His thoughts from these alleviations that He might suffer absolutely and perfectly.  O my God and Saviour, who went through such sufferings for me with such lively consciousness, such precision, such recollection, and such fortitude, enable me, by Thy help, if I am brought into the power of this terrible trial, bodily pain, enable me to bear it with some portion of Thy calmness. Obtain for me this grace, O Virgin Mother, who didst see thy Son suffer and didst suffer with Him; that I, when I suffer, may associate my sufferings with His and with thine, and that through His passion, and thy merits and those of all Saints, they may be a satisfaction for my sins and procure for me eternal life."- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Meditations and Devotions

       On November 13, 1841  Venerable John Henry Newman, already shaken in his Anglicanism, wrote the following letter to his bishop to protest an early attempt at false ecumenism, in which various Christians in Jerusalem were to be 'united' under the Anglican bishop there- without any attempt to have them have the same theology.   " REV. J. H. NEWMAN TO THE BISHOP OF OXFORD  It seems as if I were never to write to your Lordship without giving you pain, and I know that my present subject does not especially concern your Lordship; yet, after a great deal of anxious thought, I lay before you the enclosed Protest.  Your Lordship will observe that I am not asking for any notice of it, unless you think that I ought to receive one. I do this very serious act in obedience to my sense of duty.  If the English Church is to enter on a new course, and assume a new aspect, it will be more pleasant to me hereafter to think that I did not suffer so grievous an event to happen without bearing witness against it.  May I be allowed to say that I augur nothing but evil if we in any respect prejudice our title to be a branch of the Apostolic Church? That article of the Creed, I need hardly observe to your Lordship is of such constraining power, that if we will not claim it and use it for ourselves, others will use it in their own behalf against us. Men who learn, whether by means of documents or measures, whether from the statements or the acts of persons in authority, that our communion is not a branch of the One Church, I foresee with much grief, will be tempted to look out for that Church elsewhere.  It is to me a subject of great dismay that, as far as the Church has lately spoken out, on the subject of the opinions which I and others hold, those opinions are, not merely not sanctioned (for that I do not ask), but not even suffered.  I earnestly hope that your Lordship will excuse my freedom in thus speaking to you of some members of your Most Rev. and Right Rev. body. With every feeling of reverent attachment to your Lordship, I am, &c.   PROTEST  WHEREAS the Church of England has a claim on the allegiance of Catholic believers only on the ground of her own claim to be considered a branch of the Catholic Church:  And, whereas the recognition of heresy, indirect as well as direct, goes far to destroy such claim in the case of any religious body:  And, whereas to admit maintainers of heresy to communion without formal renunciation of their errors, goes far towards recognising the same:  And, whereas Lutheranism and Calvinism are heresies, repugnant to Scripture, springing up three centuries since, and anathematised by East as well as West:  And, whereas it is reported that the Most Rev. Primate and other Right Rev. Rulers of our Church have consecrated a Bishop, with a view to exercising spiritual jurisdiction over Protestant, that is, Lutheran and Calvinistic congregations in the East (under the provisions of an Act made in the last session of Parliament to amend an Act made in the twenty-sixth year of the reign of His Majesty King George III., intituled, 'an Act to empower the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Archbishop of York for the time being, to consecrate to the office of a Bishop persons being subjects or citizens of countries out of His Majesty's dominions'), dispensing at the same time, not in particular cases and accidentally, but as if on principle and universally, with any abjuration of errors on the part of such congregations, and with any reconciliation to the Church on the part of the presiding Bishop; thereby giving in some sort a formal recognition to the doctrines which such congregations maintain:  And, whereas the dioceses in England are connected together by so close an intercommunion, that what is done by authority in one immediately affects the rest:  On these grounds, I, in my place, being a Priest of the English Church, and Vicar of St. Mary's, Oxford, by way of relieving my conscience, do hereby solemnly protest against the measure aforesaid, and disown it, as removing our Church from her present ground, and tending to her disorganisation. JOHN HENRY NEWMAN."

This unseen, secret, mysterious, spiritual Temple exists every where, throughout the kingdom of Christ, in all places, as perfect in one place as if it were not in another. Wherever there is faith and love, this Temple is. " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "The Visible Temple",   Parochial and Plain Sermons

       The Feast of St. Cecilia, Virgin and Martyr  is today. There is information on her  urlLink here. . I blogged a poem on her  urlLink last year . Prayers for all musicians, particularly those who use their gifts to assist at the Sacred Liturgy, would be most welcome. (That would include prayers for your humble webscribe and the choir to which she belongs.) For others who have her as a special patron, especially  urlLink these wonderful Religious , happy feast day !    "Who has not heard of the abundant favours gained by the intercession of the Blessed Virgin, and of the marvellous consequences which have attended the invocation of St. Antony of Padua? These phenomena are sometimes reported of Saints in their lifetime, as well as after their death, especially if they were evangelists or martyrs. The wild beasts crouched before their victims in the Roman amphitheatre; the axe-man was unable to sever St. Cecilia's head from her body, and St. Peter elicited a spring of water for his jailor's baptism in the Mamertine. St. Francis Xavier turned salt water into fresh for five hundred travellers; St. Raymond was transported over the sea on his cloak; St. Andrew shone brightly in the dark; St. Scholastica gained by her prayers a pouring rain; St. Paul was fed by ravens; and St. Frances saw her guardian Angel. I need not continue the catalogue; here what one party urges, the other admits; they join issue over a fact; that fact is the claim of miracles on the part of the Catholic Church; it is the Protestants' charge, and it is our glory." - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Lectures on the Present Position of Catholics in England   Today is also the feast of a set of fairly recently beatified  urlLink Martyrs of England, Scotland, and Wales . The anniversary of  the death of  urlLink C.S. Lewis  is today as well, and in honor of those martyrs who died for Christ's Church and the memory of a great Christian who, alas, did not (despite the hopes of the Professor) find his way into the Catholic Church during in his lifetime, I would suggest that prayers for Christian unity would be appropriate.

       The Feast of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary   is today.  "Such, then, is the truth ever cherished in the deep heart of the Church, and witnessed by the keen apprehension of her children, that no limits but those proper to a creature can be assigned to the sanctity of Mary. Therefore, did Abraham believe that a son should be born to him of his aged wife? then Mary's faith must be held as greater when she accepted Gabriel's message. Did Judith consecrate her widowhood to God to the surprise of her people? much more did Mary, from her first youth, devote her virginity. Did Samuel, when a child, inhabit the Temple, secluded from the world? Mary too was by her parents lodged in the same holy precincts, even at the age when children first can choose between good and evil.  " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

       On November 19, 1876  Venerable John Henry Newman preached a sermon on the First and Second Advents, of which we have the following notes:  " [The First and Second Advents] 1. The mustard seed.  2. The Church between the two comings of Christ.  3. Those comings both awful, Mal. iii, and Mal. xxiv. 29, etc.  4. [But] this differencethe first expected; the latter suddenMark xiii.the ten virgins.  5. The firstJacob's prophecy [the time fixed, i.e.  when  the sceptre shall have departed from Judah]Daniel's 70 weeks=490 years.  6. The second [sudden] like the Flood and [the destruction of] SodomLuke xvii. 26-30.  7. Hence 'watch and pray,' Mark xiii.  8. And so St. Paula first duty to wait, 1 Thess. i. 10 ['to wait for his son from heaven'], Rom. xii., and Heb. x.  9. But it may be said, What difference between this and waiting for the death of each?   10. Against building and plantingprogress.  11. Making this structure and polity of visible society a god to be worshipped, though the individual dies.  12. No, all we see will come to nought, however great and beautiful, Isa. ii.  finis.

The course of passion, and the fret     Of godless hope and fear,  Toil, care, and guilt,their hues have set,     And fix'd their sternness there.   Saviour! wash out the imprinted shame;     That I no more may pine,  Sin's martyr, though not meet to claim     Thy cross, a saint of Thine.    Oxford. November 18, 1832.

       For those wondering about Fr. Michael and his attempt at acting as a Subdeacon for that Tridentine Rite Nuptial Mass...   things went well, but not exactly as planned. The one who was supposed to be acting as deacon did not show up, and Fr. Michael had to fill in for him. I will get more details later.  Also, it seems that Fr. Michael ran into a parishoner of St. Blog's while he was in DC - the  urlLink Man with Black Hat . I'll get more details on that as well.....

       On November 16th, 1844  Venerable John Henry Newman, who had resigned from the Anglican ministry the previous year but was still struggling with whether he should join the Catholic Church or not, wrote the following in a letter to a friend:   "I am going through what must be gone through; and my trust only is that every day of pain is so much taken from the necessary draught which must be exhausted. There is no fear (humanly speaking) of my moving for a long time yet. This has got out without my intending it; but it is all well. As far as I know myself, my one great distress is the perplexity, unsettlement, alarm, scepticism, which I am causing to so many; and the loss of kind feeling and good opinion on the part of so many, known and unknown, who have wished well to me. And of these two sources of pain it is the former that is the constant, urgent, unmitigated one. I had for days a literal ache all about my heart; and from time to time all the complaints of the Psalmist seemed to belong to me.  And as far as I know myself, my one paramount reason for contemplating a change is my deep, unvarying conviction that our Church is in schism, and that my salvation depends on my joining the Church of Rome. I may use  argumenta ad hominem  to this person or that; but I am not conscious of resentment, or disgust, at any thing that has happened to me. I have no visions whatever of hope, no schemes of action, in any other sphere more suited to me. I have no existing sympathies with Roman Catholics; I hardly ever, even abroad, was at one of their services; I know none of them, I do not like what I hear of them.  And then, how much I am giving up in so many ways! and to me sacrifices irreparable, not only from my age, when people hate changing, but from my especial love of old associations and the pleasures of memory. Nor am I conscious of any feeling, enthusiastic or heroic, of pleasure in the sacrifice; I have nothing to support me here.  What keeps me yet is what has kept me long; a fear that I am under a delusion; but the conviction remains firm under all circumstances, in all frames of mind. And this most serious feeling is growing on me; viz. that the reasons for which I believe as much as our system teaches, must lead me to believe more, and that not to believe more is to fall back into scepticism.  A thousand thanks for your most kind and consoling letter; though I have not yet spoken of it, it was a great gift."

       The Solemnity of Christ the King  is today.  "Why did Christ show Himself to so few witnesses after He rose from the dead? Because He was  a King , a King exalted upon God's 'Holy hill of Zion;' as the Psalm says which contains the text. Kings do not court the multitude, or show themselves as a spectacle at the will of others. They are the rulers of their people, and have their state as such, and are reverently waited on by their great men: and when they show themselves, they do so out of their condescension. They act by means of their servants, and must be  sought  by those who would gain favours from them.  Christ, in like manner, when exalted as the Only-begotten Son of God, did not mix with the Jewish people, as in the days of His humiliation. He rose from the grave in secret, and taught in secret for forty days, because 'the government was upon His shoulder.' He was no longer a servant washing His disciples' feet, and dependent on the wayward will of the multitude. He was the acknowledged Heir of all things. His throne was established by a Divine decree; and those who desired His salvation, were bound to  seek  His face. Yet not even by those who sought was He at once found. He did not permit the world to approach Him rashly, or curiously to gaze on Him. Those only did He call beside Him who had been His friends, who loved Him. Those only He bade 'ascend the hill of the Lord,' who had 'clean hands and a pure heart, who had not worshipped vanity nor sworn deceitfully.'These drew near, and "saw the Lord God of Israel," and so were fitted to bear the news of Him to the people at large.  He  remained "in His holy temple;"  they  from Him proclaimed the tidings of His resurrection, and of His mercy, His free pardon offered to all men, and the promises of grace and glory which His death had procured for all who believe.  Thus are we taught to serve our risen Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Let us pursue the subject thus opened upon us.Christ's second sojourn on earth (after His resurrection) was  in secret . The time had been when He 'preached openly in the synagogues,' and in the public ways; and openly wrought miracles such as man never did. Was there to be no end of His labours in our behalf? His  death  'finished' them; afterwards He taught His  followers  only. Who shall complain of His withdrawing Himself at last from the world, when it was of His own spontaneous loving-kindness that He ever showed Himself at all?  Yet it must be borne in mind, that even before He entered into His glory, Christ spoke and acted as a King. It must not be supposed that, even in the days of His flesh, He could forget who He was, or 'behave Himself unseemly' by any weak submission to the will of the Jewish people. Even in the lowest acts of His self-abasement, still He showed His greatness. Consider His conduct when He washed St. Peter's feet, and see if it were not calculated (assuredly it was) to humble, to awe, and subdue the very person to whom He ministered. When He taught, warned, pitied, prayed for, His ignorant hearers, He never allowed them to relax their reverence or to overlook His condescension. Nay, He did not allow them to praise Him aloud, and publish His acts of grace; as if what is called popularity would be a dishonour to His holy name, and the applause of men would imply their right to censure. The world's praise is akin to contempt. Our Lord delights in the tribute of the secret heart. "- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Parochial and Plain Sermons

       For Saturday  and the upcoming feast.....  " Let me take the doctrine which Protestants consider our greatest difficulty, that of the Immaculate Conception. Here I entreat the reader to recollect my main drift, which is this. I have no difficulty in receiving it :and that, because it so intimately harmonizes with that circle of recognized dogmatic truths, into which it has been recently received;but if  I  have no difficulty, why may not another have no difficulty also? why may not a hundred? a thousand? Now I am sure that Catholics in general have not any intellectual difficulty at all on the subject of the Immaculate Conception; and that there is no reason why they should. Priests have no difficulty. You tell me that they  ought  to have a difficulty;but they have not. Be large-minded enough to believe, that men may reason and feel very differently from yourselves; how is it that men fall, when left to themselves, into such various forms of religion, except that there are various types of mind among them, very distinct from each other? From my testimony then about myself, if you believe it, judge of others also who are Catholics: we do not find the difficulties which you do in the doctrines which we hold; we have no intellectual difficulty in that doctrine in particular, which you call a novelty of this day. We priests need not be hypocrites, though we be called upon to believe in the Immaculate Conception. To that large class of minds, who believe in Christianity, after our manner,in the particular temper, spirit, and light, (whatever word is used,) in which Catholics believe it,there is no burden at all in holding that the Blessed Virgin was conceived without original sin; indeed, it is a simple fact to say, that Catholics have not come to believe it because it is defined, but that it was defined because they believed it.  So far from the definition in 1854 being a tyrannical infliction on the Catholic world, it was received every where on its promulgation with the greatest enthusiasm. It was in consequence of the unanimous petition, presented from all parts of the Church to the Holy See, in behalf of a  ex cathedrâ  declaration that the doctrine was Apostolic, that it was declared so to be. I never heard of one Catholic having difficulties in receiving it , whose faith on other grounds was not already suspicious. Of course there were grave and good men, who were made anxious by the doubt whether it could be formallyproved to be Apostolical either by Scripture or tradition, and who accordingly, though believing it themselves, did  not see how it could be defined by authority and imposed upon all Catholics as a matter of faith; but this is another matter. The point in question is, whether the doctrine is a burden. I believe it to be none. So far from it being so, I sincerely think that St. Bernard and St. Thomas, who scrupled at it in their day, had they lived into this, would have rejoiced to accept it for its own sake. Their difficulty, as I view it, consisted in matters of words, ideas, and arguments. They thought the doctrine inconsistent with other doctrines; and those who defended it in that age had not that precision in their view of it, which has been given to it [Note 46] by means of the long controversy of the centuries which followed. And hence the difference of opinion, and the controversy. " -Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Apologia Pro Vita Sua

        A bit of spine in a bishop   is truly a  urlLink fine    urlLink thing .  The articles are filled with infuriating quotes, but the one that really got me: Patrick Flaherty of Milwaukee LGBT ....  "We think keeping young gay people HIV-free is a laudable goal," he said. "It's unfortunate that the bishop does not feel the same."   Au contraire , Mr Flaherty. It's the Bishop who truly wants to keep "young gay people" HIV-free- by persuading them that acts of sexual perversion are immoral and thus keeping them from engaging in such acts. You, on the other hand, would not dissuade them from such acts, and thus, since no other 'preventative' measures are foolproof, are letting such conflicted people flirt with death, spiritual as well as physical.    And then there is  the breath-taking false naivete of Fr. Michael Hammer....  "I don't understand why homosexuality is an issue in relation to the AIDS Walk...."  Has this man been living in a cave for the past 20 years ? True, not all of those infected engaged in perverted acts, and things are somewhat different in other countries, but in the United States the correspondence between the two is marked enough that not seeing why it is an issue is making oneself deliberately blind- which seems to be something at which certain people excel.

       On December 3, 1876   Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive. " December 3 (First Advent) [The Second Advent] 1. The gospel this day a portion of our Lord's prophecy [of the destruction of Jerusalem and the second coming], rising out of the apostle's admiration of the beauty of the Temple.  2. It seemed to them too beautiful to be destroyed.  3. This is the way with men; they wonder at their own great works; they look up to the great works of their fellows; and when they are able to trace out the beauty of God's creation, that too they make an idol, and bow down before their own work, loving the map [which they have made] of it, and say they have discovered it to be too beautiful to be broken.  4. It is well for man, an  homuncio , thus to think, for he can do a great thing but once; but God destroys His own works, however beautiful, because He could from His infinite resources create many worlds each more beautiful [than] those that were before it.  5. And His own works He regards not, if they have not that note of  sanctity  which He breathed on them in the beginning.   6. Therefore when the Jews, His own people, came to nought, if He did not spare the work of His own hands, much less [was He likely to spare] Herod's work.  7. Babylon and Nabuchodonosor.  8. Now in this [the present] state of society it is pride, not open sensuality [which is conspicuous]; i.e. think of the greatness of an army, of a popular assembly, of some queen's ball. But whenever the world looks imposing and likely to last, that is the most likely time that it will be brought to an end, or at least [is the likely time] of some great judgment.

       The Solemn Profession  was beautiful. I don't think I've ever seen anyone look more radiant and joyful than Sr. Claire Benedicta did on Saturday.  The tiny chapel of her Carmel was overflowing with people, despite the fact that we had the first snowfall of the season and it's probable that some folks could'nt make it for that reason.  Before the Mass began, I did hear one thing which amused me a little. A gentleman in the pew behind me said to the lady next to him,  sotto voce . "This feels sort of like a wedding.", whereupon she whispered back to him, "That's because it is ! "

He saw of old, and met your need,  Granting you prophets of His creed,       The throes of fear to swage;  They fenced the rich bequest He made,  And sacred hands have safe convey'd       Their charge from age to age.    Wand'rers! come home! obey the call!  A Mother pleads, who ne'er let fall       One grain of Holy Truth;  Warn you and win she shall and must,  For now she lifts her from the dust,       To reign as in her youth. "      Off Cape Ortegal.

       The Feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary   is today.  "As to primitive notion about our Blessed Lady, really, the frequent contrast of Mary with Eve seems very strong indeed. It is found in St. Justin, St. Iren?us, and Tertullian, three of the earliest Fathers, and in three distinct continentsGaul, Africa, and Syria. For instance, 'the knot formed by Eve's disobedience was untied by the obedience of Mary; that what the Virgin Eve tied through unbelief that the Virgin Mary unties through faith.'Again, 'The Virgin Mary becomes the Advocate (Paraclete) of the Virgin Eve, that  as  mankind has been bound to death  through  a Virgin,  through  a Virgin it may be saved, the balance being preserved, a Virgin's disobedience by a Virgin's obedience' (St. Irenaeus,  Haer . v. 19). Again, 'As Eve, becoming disobedient, became  the cause  of death to herself and to  all mankind , so Mary, too, bearing the predestined Man, and yet a Virgin, being obedient, became the CAUSE OF SALVATION both to herself and to all mankind.' Again, 'Eve being a Virgin, and incorrupt, bore disobedience and death, but Mary the Virgin, receiving faith and joy, when Gabriel the Angel evangelised her, answered, 'Be it unto me,'" &c. Again, "What Eve failed in believing, Mary by believing  hath  blotted out.' "- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. , "Memorandum on the Immaculate Conception"

Son of immortal seed, high-destined Man!  Know thy dread gift,a creature, yet a cause:  Each mind is its own centre, and it draws  Home to itself, and moulds in its thought's span  All outward things, the vassals of its will,  Aided by Heaven, by earth unthwarted still.

       Haven't done a quiz in a while...  and this one actually pegs  me nicely...    You are 'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing'.  You take Christmas very seriously.  For you, it is a religious festival, celebrating the birth of the Saviour, and its current secularisation really irritates you.  You enjoy the period of Advent leading up to Christmas, and attend any local carol services you can find, as well as the more contemplative Advent church services each Sunday.  You may be involved in Christmas food collections or similar charity work.  The midnight service at your church, with candles and carols, is one you look forward to all year, and you also look forward to the family get together on Christmas Day.    urlLink   What Christmas Carol are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Link courtesy of  urlLink Michelle .

       December 14, 1816  was an important day in the life of Venerable Newman. As he himself later wrote: "From school he went straight to Oxford, being entered at Trinity College on December 14, 1816, when he was as yet two months short of sixteen. "  He would live in Oxford or its immediate vicinity for the next 29 years- and then be away from Oxford for 33 years.

       If it were not Sunday...  today would be the feast of  urlLink St. John of the Cross, O.C.D, Priest and Doctor of the Church . It would also be the feast of  urlLink St. Venantius Fortunatus, Bishop . I hereby post a hymn by the latter.  " Vexilla regis prodeunt Fulget crucis mysterium Quo carne carnis conditor Suspensus est patibulo.   Quo vulneratus insuper Mucrone diro lanceae Ut nos lavaret crimine Manavit unda et sanguine.   Impleta sunt quae concinit David fideli carmine Dicens In nationibus Regnavit a ligno Deus.   Arbor decora et fulgida Ornata Regis purpura Electa digno stipite Tam sancta membra tangere.   Beata, cujus brachiis Saecli pependit pretium Statera facta corporis Praedamque tulit tartari.   O Crux ave, spes unica In hac triumphi gloria Auge piis justitiam Reisque dona veniam.   Te summa Deus Trinitas Collaudet omnis spiritus: Quos per crucis mysterium Salvas, rege per saecula. Amen. "  and a translated version.....  "The royal banners forward go, The cross shines forth in mystic glow; Where He in flesh, our flesh Who made, Our sentence bore, our ransom paid.  Where deep for us the spear was dyed, Lifes torrent rushing from His side, To wash us in that precious flood, Where mingled water flowed, and blood.  Fulfilled is all that David told In true prophetic song of old, Amidst the nations, God, saith he, Hath reigned and triumphed from the tree.  O tree of beauty, tree of light! O tree with royal purple dight! Elect on whose triumphal breast Those holy limbs should find their rest.  Blest tree, whose chosen branches bore The wealth that did the world restore, The price of humankind to pay, And spoil the spoiler of his prey.  Upon its arms, like balance true, He weighed the price for sinners due, The price which none but He could pay, And spoiled the spoiler of his prey.  O cross, our one reliance, hail! Still may thy power with us avail To give new virtue to the saint, And pardon to the penitent.  To Thee, eternal Three in One, Let homage meet by all be done: As by the cross Thou dost restore, So rule and guide us evermore. "

       The Feast of St. Stephen, Deacon and Martyr  is today. There is information on him  urlLink here . To all who have him as a special patron, especially any deacons out there, happy feast day !  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon on December 26th, 1875, on which the following notes survive:  "  December 26 (St. Stephen) [The Martyrs]   1. INTROD.The first martyrwhat meant by a martyrwitness for the truth. Christ the first martyr, but He  more  than a martyr.  2. There is one God, but He was forgotten by all the earth (except the Jews).   3. If one God, only one religion. But every nation had its own god or gods, and they never thought of interfering with each other.  4. God suffered this for a long while (Acts xiv. 16), but at length, etc.  5. Hence preachers and evangelists, apostlesbut men did not like to be interfered with. It was a new thing; hence persecutions, and the preachers became martyrs.  6. In Jerusalem they first suffered, because they came in collision with the prejudices of the Jewssuch St. Stephenthen a wider rangethe apostles all martyrs.  7. The  Te Deum   calls them an army(enlarge upon this). Contrast to Mahometansnay, to Protestantism, which spreads, not indeed by persecution, but by the patronage, etc., of the State. What can be more wonderful than an army conquering by being beaten?  8. The most horrible deaths; stoning is bad enough, but it [was] only one waySt. Andrew, St. Bartholomew, St. Peter, St. James, St. Paul, St. John (oil)the young, the old, the weak, the strong, men and women.  9. FIRST REFLECTION. Thus  are  we  Christians. What, under God, do we not owe to them?  10. SECOND REFLECTION.How  comfortable  our lives are! The thought of the martyrs should support those too who are in pain, etc., and those who see their friends in pain.  11. All this should humble us. "

       To everyone....  A blessed Christmas to all! I send special greetings to  urlLink William Luse , who e-mailed me the compliments of the season. (Bill, I tried to e-mail back twice, but the messages both failed ! Sorry !)   " 'The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;' this is the glorious, unsearchable, incomprehensible Truth, on which all our hopes for the future depend, and which we have now been commemorating. It is the wonderful Economy of Redemption, by which God became man, the Highest became the lowest, the Creator took His place among His own creatures, Power became weakness, and Wisdom looked to men like folly. He that was rich was made poor; the Lord of all was rejected: 'He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.' This, I say, is the grand mystery of the season..." - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

       Yes, I saw the movie yesterday....(SPOILERS!)  I could nitpick until the cows come home, and I didn't care for the depiction of Denethor or the Frodo/Sam 'rift', short-lived though it was... but I was on the edge of my seat for most of it and was in tears during the Grey Havens scene. Not perfect by a long shot, but I think it's an impressive effort and am looking forward to the extended edition.   Actually, I may be a bit easier on the films than some, simply because I have seen them interest a lot of people in the book. Anything that gets more people to read the Professor tends to win my approval by that very fact. (For example, before the movies,  you did  not  see copies of the three volumes on grocery store bookracks. Now they are everywhere. )

        The Feast of the Most Holy Name of Jesus  is today.  "The martyrs, the confessors of the Church, bishops, evangelists, doctors, preachers, monks, hermits, ascetical teachers,have they not, one and all, as their histories show, lived on the very name of Jesus, as food, as medicine, as fragrance, as light, as life from the dead?" - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  My online source says that his feast was on Thursday, but I have a print source which says that the feast of  urlLink St. Joseph Mary Tomasi  is actually today.  I am particularly interested in him because he was a brilliant scholar and cardinal who was also known for his holiness of life. Sound familiar ?

St. Gregory Nazianzen   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  "Peace-loving  man, of humble heart and true                 What dost thou here?  Fierce is the city's crowd; the lordly few                 Are dull of ear!  Sore pain it was to thee,till thou didst quit  Thy patriarch-throne at length, as though for        power unfit.   So works the All-wise! our services dividing                 Not as we ask:  For the world's profit, by our gifts deciding                 Our duty-task.  See in king's courts loth Jeremias plead;  And slow-tongued Moses rule by eloquence of        deed!   Yes! thou, bright Angel of the East! didst rear                 The Cross divine,  Borne high upon thy liquid accents, where                 Men mock'd the Sign;  Till that cold city heard thy battle-cry,  And hearts were stirr'd, and deem'd a Pentecost         was nigh.   Thou couldst a people raise, but couldst not         rule:                 So, gentle one,  Heaven set thee free,for, ere thy years were full,                 Thy work was done;  According thee the lot thou lovedst best,  To muse upon the past,to serve, yet be at rest.

       The Feast of the Holy Family  is today.   "When, for our sakes, the Son came on earth and took our flesh, yet He would not live without the sympathy of others. For thirty years He lived with Mary and Joseph and thus formed a shadow of the Heavenly Trinity on earth. O the perfection of  that sympathy which existed between the three! Not a look of one, but the other two understood, as expressed, better than if expressed in a thousand wordsnay more than understood, accepted, echoed, corroborated. It was like three instruments absolutely in tune which all vibrate when one vibrates, and vibrate either one and the same note, or in perfect harmony. " -Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

       For Thursday  "And if you are conscious that your hearts are hard, and are desirous that they should be softened, do not despair. All things are possible to you, through God's grace. Come to Him for the will and the power to do that to which He calls you. He never forsakes anyone who calls upon Him. He never puts any trial on a man but He gives him grace to overcome it. Do not despair then; nay do not despond, even though you do come to Him, yet are not at once exalted to overcome yourselves. He gives grace by little and little. It is by coming daily into His presence, that by degrees we find ourselves awed by that presence and able to believe and obey Him. Therefore if any one desires illumination to know God's will as well as strength to do it, let him come to Mass daily, if he possibly can. At least let him present himself daily before the Blessed Sacrament, and, as it were, offer his heart to His Incarnate Saviour, presenting it as a reasonable offering to be influenced, changed and sanctified under the eye and by the grace of the Eternal Son.

        On January 7th, 1864  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. wrote a reply in his escalating epistolary battle with the Reverend Charles Kingsley.   "The Oratory, Birmingham, January 7, 1864. REVEREND SIR, I have to acknowledge your letter of the 6th, informing me that you are the writer of an article in Macmillan's Magazine, in which I am mentioned, and referring generally to a Protestant sermon of mine of seventeen pages, published by me, as Vicar of St. Mary's, in 1844, and treating of the bearing of the Christian towards the world, and of the character of the reaction of that bearing upon him; and also, referring to my works  passim ; in justification of your statement, categorical and definite, that 'Father Newman informs us that truth for its own sake need not, and on the whole ought not to be, a virtue with the Roman clergy.'  I have only to remark, in addition to what I have already said with great sincerity to Messrs. Macmillan and Co., in the letter of which you speak, and to which I refer you, that, when I wrote to them, no person whatever, whom I had ever seen or heard of, had occurred to me as the author of the statement in question. When I received your letter, taking upon yourself the authorship, I was amazed. I am, Reverend Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) JOHN H. NEWMAN. "  The next day, he wrote a letter to the publisher involved, who had attempted to 'calm the waters' a bit with a letter of his own.   " The Oratory, January 8, 1864. DEAR SIR, I thank you for the friendly tone of your letter of the 5th just received, and I wish to reply to it with the frankness which it invites. I have heard from Mr. Kingsley, avowing himself, to my extreme astonishment, the author of the passage about which I wrote to Messrs. Macmillan. No one, whose name I had ever heard, crossed my mind as the writer in their Magazine: and, had any one said that it was Mr. Kingsley, I should have laughed in his face. Certainly, I saw the initials at the end; but, you must recollect, I live out of the world; and, I must own, if Messrs. Macmillan will not think the confession rude, that, as far as I remember, I never before saw even the outside of their Magazine. And so of the Editor: when I saw his name on the cover, it conveyed to me absolutely no idea whatever. I am not defending myself, but merely stating what was the fact; and as to the article, I said to myself, 'Here is a young scribe, who is making himself a cheap reputation by smart hits at safe objects.'  All this will make you see, not only how I live out of the world, but also how wanton I feel it to have been in the parties concerned thus to let fly at me. Were I in active controversy with the Anglican body, or any portion of it, as I have been before now, I should consider untrue assertions about me to be in a certain sense a rule of the game, as times go, though God forbid that I should indulge in them myself in the case of another. I have never been very sensitive of such attacks; rarely taken notice of them. Now, when I have long ceased from controversy, they continue: they have lasted incessantly from the year 1833 to this day. They do not ordinarily come in my way: when they do, I let them pass through indolence. Sometimes friends send me specimens of them; and sometimes they are such as I am bound to answer, if I would not compromise interests which are dearer to me than life. The January number of the Magazine was sent to me, I know not by whom, friend or foe, with the passage to which I have animadverted, emphatically, not to say indignantly, scored against. Nor can there be a better proof that there was a call upon me to notice it, than the astounding fact that you can so calmly (excuse me) 'confess plainly' of yourself, as you do, 'that you had read the passage, and did not even think that I or any of my communion would think it unjust.'  Most wonderful phenomenon! An educated man, breathing English air, and walking in the light of the nineteenth century, thinks that neither I nor any members of my communion feel any difficulty in allowing that 'Truth for its own sake need not, and on the whole ought not to be, a virtue with the Roman clergy;' nay, that they are not at all surprised to be told that 'Father Newman had informed' the world, that such is the standard of morality acknowledged, acquiesced in, by his co-religionists! But, I suppose, in truth, there is nothing at all, however base, up to the high mark of Titus Oates, which a Catholic may not expect to be believed of him by Protestants, however honourable and hard-headed. However, dismissing this natural train of thought, I observe on your avowal as follows; and I think what I shall say will commend itself to your judgment as soon as I say it.  I think you will allow then, that there is a broad difference between a virtue, considered in itself as a principle or rule, and the application or limits of it in human conduct. Catholics and Protestants, in their view of the substance of the moral virtues, agree, but they carry them out variously in detail; and in particular instances, and in the case of particular actors or writers, with but indifferent success. Truth is the same in itself and in substance to Catholic and Protestant; so is purity: both virtues are to be referred to that moral sense which is the natural possession of us all. But when we come to the question in detail, whether this or that act in particular is conformable to the rule of truth, or again to the rule of purity; then sometimes there is a difference of opinion between individuals, sometimes between schools, and sometimes between religious communions. I, on my side, have long thought, even before I was a Catholic, that the Protestant system, as such, leads to a lax observance of the rule of purity; Protestants think that the Catholic system, as such, leads to a lax observance of the rule of truth. I am very sorry that they should think so, but I cannot help it; I lament their mistake, but I bear it as I may. If Mr. Kingsley had said no more than this, I should not have felt it necessary to criticize such an ordinary remark. But, as I should be committing a crime, heaping dirt upon my soul, and storing up for myself remorse and confusion of face at a future day, if I applied my abstract belief of the latent sensuality of Protestantism, on  à priori   reasoning, to individuals, to living persons, to authors and men of name, and said (not to make disrespectful allusion to the living) that Bishop Van Mildert, or the Rev. Dr. Spry, or Dean Milner, or the Rev. Charles Simeon 'informs us that chastity for its own sake need not be, and on the whole ought not to be, a virtue with the Anglican clergy,' and then, when challenged for the proof, said, " Vide  Van Mildert's Bampton Lectures and Simeon's Skeleton Sermons  passim ;' and, as I should only make the matter still worse, if I pointed to flagrant instances of paradoxical divines or of bad clergymen among Protestants, as, for instance, to that popular London preacher at the end of last century who advocated polygamy in print; so, in like manner, for a writer, when he is criticizing definite historical facts of the sixteenth century, which stand or fall on their own merits, to go out of his way to have a fling at an unpopular name, living but 'down,' and boldly to say to those who know no better, who know nothing but what he tells them, who take their tradition of historical facts from him, who do not know me,to say of me, 'Father Newman informs us that Truth for its own sake need not be, and on the whole ought not to be, a virtue with the Roman clergy,' and to be thus brilliant and antithetical (save the mark!) in the very cause of Truth, is a proceeding of so special a character as to lead me to exclaim, after the pattern of the celebrated saying, 'O Truth, how many lies are told in thy name!' ..."  The controversy continued in these  urlLink letters , and led to a  urlLink pamphlet   by the Reverend Kingsley in whch he made his original accusation seem downright tame by the heap of insulting verbiage he poured out on Newman and the Catholic Church. However, it was this which led to the writing of Venerable Newman's masterpiece,  urlLink  Apologia Pro Vita Sua  .

       Over at Mere Comments   there is currently a plethora of links to good articles, but there was one in particular which I found profoundly disturbing:   urlLink  Dead Kids on the Block  The article deals with the pain-filled lives and early deaths of women who sell their bodies- usually for money to feed their drug addictions- and is, obviously, not meant for children-though most of the subjects of the piece are so young they are almost children themselves. The part I found most appalling was this:  "I remember a few years back listening to a talk radio program. A jolly lady, in her own words a 'senior citizen,'was speaking with chuckles about the time she gave her husband a special birthday present. She took him to the Block and paid for him to cut off a young womans clothes with scissors.The host, whom I know to be a very intelligent and principled conservative, said, 'And I bet everybody had a good time.' 'Oh yes,' chuckled the elderly woman. Hey, a bit of fun. It is one of those things that makes Balmer (ed. Baltimore)  a grand ole place."  How could a woman possibly have so little self-respect that she would pay,   pay , for her own husband to drool over one of these pathetic kids ?

       I looked at an old post...  and discovered that Blogger had messed up the special characters in it-and that just won't do. So here, once again, thanks to Helge Fauskanger at  urlLink Ardalambion  and the Professor, is Genesis 1 in Quenya.    1. I yessessë Eru ontanë Menel ar Cemen. 2 Cemen né cumna ar lusta, ar engë mornië or i undumë, nan Eruo Súlë willë or i neni.   3 Ar equë Eru: "Eä cálë!"

When I was on Ardalambion, I discovered that Mr. Fauskanger has also done a bit of the New Testament as well....   18 I colië Yésus Hristova martanë sië: Írë amillerya María né nauta vestien Yósef, nes hírina lapsarwa i Airefëanen, epë nentë ertainë. 19 Mal Yósef vennorya, i né faila ar úmë merë naitya se, mernë lerya se nuldavë. 20 Mal apa sannes sin, en! i Heruo vala tullë senna oloressë, quétala: "Yósef Lavirion, áva rucë mapiello María vesselya marenna, an ya ná nostaina sessë i Airefëanen ná. 21 Coluvas yondo, ar estuvalyes Yésus, an etelehtuvas lierya úcarintallon." 22 Ilqua sina martanë quantien ya i Heru quentë tercánoryanen, quétala: " En !  i vendë nauva lapsarwa ar coluva yondo, ar antuvantë sen i essë Immanuel" - ya tëa "Aselvë Eru". 24 San Yósef, apa cuivierya fúmeryallo, carnë ve i Heruo vala cannë sen, ar mampes vesserya marenna. 25 Mal úmes ista se epë colles yondo, ar ánes sen i essë Yésus.

       Just because   "The Church, though she embraces all conceivable virtues in her teaching, and every kind of good, temporal as well as spiritual, in her exertions, does not survey them from the same point of view, or classify them in the same order as the world. She makes secondary what the world considers indispensable; she places first what the world does not even recognise, or undervalues, or dislikes, or thinks impossible; and not being able, taking mankind as it is found, to do everything, she is often obliged to give up altogether what she thinks of great indeed, but of only secondary moment, in a particular age or a particular country, instead of effecting at all risks that extirpation of social evils, which, in the world's eyes, is so necessary, that it thinks nothing really is done till it is secured. Her base of operations, from the difficulties of the season or the period, is sometimes not broad enough to enable her to advance against crime as well as against sin, and to destroy barbarism as well as irreligion. The world, in consequence, thinks, that because she has not done the world's work, she has not fulfilled her Master's purpose; and imputes to her the enormity of having put eternity before time.  And next, let it be observed that she has undertaken the more difficult work; it is difficult, certainly, to enlighten the savage, to make him peaceable, orderly, and self-denying; to persuade him to dress like a European, to make him prefer a feather-bed to the heather or the cave, and to appreciate the comforts of the fireside and the tea-table: but it is indefinitely more difficult, even with the supernatural powers given to the Church, to make the most refined, accomplished, amiable of men, chaste or humble; to bring, not only his outward actions, but his thoughts, imaginations, and aims, into conformity to a law which is naturally distasteful to him. It is not wonderful, then, if the Church does not do so much in the Church's way, as the world does in the world's way. The world has nature as an ally, and the Church, on the whole, and as things are, has nature as an enemy.  And lastly, as I have implied, her best fruit is necessarily secret: she fights with the heart of man; her perpetual conflict is against the pride, the impurity, the covetousness, the envy, the cruelty, which never gets so far as to come to light; which she succeeds in strangling in its birth. From the nature of the case, she ever will do more in repressing evil than in creating good; moreover, virtue and sanctity, even when realised, are also in great measure secret gifts, known only to God and good Angels; for these, then, and other reasons, the powers and the triumphs of the Church must be hid from the world, unless the doors of the Confessional could be flung open, and its whispers carried abroad on the voices of the winds. Nor indeed would even such disclosures suffice for the due comparison of the Church with religions which aim at no personal self-government, and disown on principle examination of conscience and confession of sin; but in order to our being able to do justice to that comparison, we must wait for the Day when the books shall be opened and the secrets of hearts shall be disclosed. For all these reasons, then, from the peculiarity, and the arduousness, and the secrecy of the mission entrusted to the Church, it comes to pass that the world is led, at particular periods, to think very slightly of the Church's influence on society, and vastly to prefer its own methods and its own achievements.

       From the homily  Fr. Joseph was the celebrant at noon Mass today. The point I remember best is that  in today's Gospel Our Lord first teaches the people who have come to Him, and then miraculously feeds them. This is a parallel to what He still does for us in the Mass- He teaches us through the Liturgy of the Word, then miraculously feeds us with His own Body and Blood.

       I found two short articles in the magazine  Sacred Archtecture   that sum up a lot of what is wrong with the attitudes of many people  towards the worship of the Almighty.   Elaborate sound and video systems are rapidly becoming the worship enhancer of choice  " 'Worship is a form of entertainment' said Al Perry, technical adviser for media ministry at Fort Foote Baptist Church in Fort Washington, Md. 'If people are not entertained, they don't feel like they're participating.' Megachurches are most likely to spend megabucks for audio-visual equipment- the 3,000-seal Evangel Temple in Upper Marlboro, Md, and the 1-500-seat McLean, Va., Bible Church each spent about $800,000,said George Sauer of DMX Music in Rockville, MD"   ;Who wants to sit in church if you're uncomfortable?'    "said  Laurie Werfel of Perrysburg, Ohio, as she sat  in the burgundy theater-style seats at Cedar Creek Church in suburban Toledo. ' I grew up in a Catholic church, and I hated sitting in those benches.' Some denominations are beginning to move away from pews. Chairs with cupholders, plenty of space, and padding are finding their way into churches where clergy say the seat can be as important as the message. The current trend of theater-style seating is a throwback to a movement in the mid-19th century, when Protestant churches in America modeled their buildings after theaters with sloping floors and individual seats. Irwin Seating, one of the world's biggest seat makers, jumped into church seating in the past year, after installing seats in places such as Carnegie Hall and the Atlanta Motor Speedway. The company is hoping to expand its reach into denominations such as the Roman Catholic Church. 'We're never going to sell there until we develop a kneeler option' a representative said. 'What you fight is really tradition.' "    Sure, we're following a Crucified Savior- but you just can't ask us to sit on seats with no padding, for crying out loud ! And you certainly can't expect us to spend our time at something that isn't  fun .   The final sentence of the second article is probably the most striking of all. "What you fight is really tradition". I'll say.

       January 5, 1828  was a terrible day in the life of Venerable John Henry Newman. His beloved youngest sister, Mary, who had suddenly become ill the previous evening, died. She was nineteen years old. As I have  urlLink previously written , the Venerable attributed this grief, along with an illness of his own slightly earlier, with shaking him out of the tendency to drift in the direction of the liberalism that was becoming common among the Fellows of Oriel College. An old family friend, Maria Giberne, who became Catholic somewhat later than the Venerable, wrote a letter to him about fifty years later, in which she recalled this event.    " M. R. G. TO H. E. CARDINAL NEWMAN   But I do not want to talk of myself. I want to tell you of my entire sympathy with you in what you say and feel about the anniversary of our dear Mary's death. This season never comes round without my repassing in my heart of hearts all the circumstances of those few daysmy first visit to your dear family. Who could ever behold that dear sweet face for any length of time and forget it again? And again, who could ever have been acquainted with the soul and heart that lent their expression to that face and not love her?  My sister Fanny and I arrived at your house on the 3rd [of January], and sweet Mary, who had drawn figures under my advice when she was staying with us at Wanstead, leant over me at a table in the drawing-room, and in that sweet voice said, 'I am so glad you are come; I hope you will help me in my drawing.' I forget about the dinner and evening on that day, for I was doubtless under considerable awe of you in those first days; but the next day Mr. Woodgate and Mr. Williams dined there, and dear Mary sat next you, and I was on the other side; and while eating a bit of turkey she turned her face towards me, her hand on her heart, so pale, and a dark ring round her eyes, and she said she felt ill, and should she go away? I asked you, and she went: I longed to accompany her, but dared not for fear of making a stir. It was the last time I saw her alive. Soon after Jemima (ed. one of Newman's other sisters)  went after her; and then your Mother, looking so distressed; and she said, 'John, I never saw Mary so ill before; I think we must send for a doctor.' You answered as if to cheer her, 'Ah, yes, Mother, and don't forget the fee.' How little I thought what the end would be! Next morning Harriett (ed. the eldest Newman sister) came to walk with us about one o'clockafter the doctor had been, I thinkbut though she said Mary had had a very bad night, she did not seem to apprehend danger. We went to dine with a friend, and only returned to your house about nine. I felt a shock in entering the house, seeing no one but youso pale and so calm, and yet so inwardly moved; and how, when I asked you to pray with us for her, you made a great effort to quiet your voice, sitting against the table, your eyes on the fire, and you answered, 'I must tell you the truth: she is dead already.' Then you went to fetch vinegar, which I did not need, for I felt turned to stone. Fanny criedI envied her her tears.  "  Venerable Newman wrote several verses dealing with this painful blow. Here is one of them:   Consolations in Bereavement    "Death was full urgent with thee, Sister dear,           And startling in his speed;  Brief pain, then languor till thy end came near           Such was the path decreed,                      The hurried road  To lead thy soul from earth to thine own God's      abode.   Death wrought with thee, sweet maid, impatiently:           Yet merciful the haste  That baffles sickness;dearest, thou didst die,           Thou wast not made to taste                      Death's bitterness,  Decline's slow-wasting charm, or fever's fierce      distress.   Death came unheralded:but it was well;           For so thy Saviour bore  Kind witness, thou wast meet at once to dwell           On His eternal shore;                      All warning spared,  For none He gives where hearts are for prompt change      prepared.   Death wrought in mystery; both complaint and cure           To human skill unknown:  God put aside all means, to make us sure           It was His deed alone;                      Lest we should lay  Reproach on our poor selves, that thou wast caught      away.   Death urged as scant of time:lest, Sister dear,           We many a lingering day  Had sicken'd with alternate hope and fear,           The ague of delay;                      Watching each spark  Of promise quench'd in turn, till all our sky was      dark.   Death came and went:that so thy image might           Our yearning hearts possess,  Associate with all pleasant thoughts and bright,           With youth and loveliness;                      Sorrow can claim,  Mary, nor lot nor part in thy soft soothing name.   Joy of sad hearts, and light of downcast eyes!           Dearest thou art enshrined  In all thy fragrance in our memories;           For we must ever find                      Bare thought of thee  Freshen this weary life, while weary life shall be. "    Oxford.  April, 1828.

       The Feast of St. John Nepomucene Neumann, C.S.S.R., Bishop   is today. There is information on him  urlLink here. . As I have mentioned  urlLink before , while he is a wonderful saint, and actually lived in my hometown of Pittsburgh for a while, the fact that people mispronounce his name and then mix him up with  urlLink someone else   drives me up the wall. It is also the feast of  urlLink St. Simeon Stylites , who seems to have invented a unique way of getting away from it all in order to pray. Apparently it worked, since he was subsequently copied by others....

       The Feast of the Epiphany of the Lord  is celebrated today in the United States. " The Epiphany is a season especially set apart for adoring the glory of Christ. The word may be taken to mean the manifestation of His glory, and leads us to the contemplation of Him as a King upon His throne in the midst of His court, with His servants around Him, and His guards in attendance. At Christmas we commemorate His grace; and in Lent His temptation; and on Good Friday His sufferings and death; and on Easter Day His victory; and on Holy Thursday His return to the Father; and in Advent we anticipate His second coming. And in all of these seasons He does something, or suffers something: but in the Epiphany and the weeks after it, we celebrate Him, not as on His field of battle, or in His solitary retreat, but as an august and glorious King; we view Him as the Object of our worship. Then only, during His whole earthly history, did He fulfil the type of Solomon, and held (as I may say) a court, and received the homage of His subjects; viz. when He was an infant. His throne was His undefiled Mother's arms; His chamber of state was a cottage or a cave; the worshippers were the wise men of the East, and they brought presents, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. All around and about Him seemed of earth, except to the eye of faith; one note alone had He of Divinity. As great men of this world are often plainly dressed, and look like other men, all but as having some one costly ornament on their breast or on their brow; so the Son of Mary in His lowly dwelling, and in an infant's form, was declared to be the Son of God Most High, the Father of Ages, and the Prince of Peace, by His star; a wonderful appearance which had guided the wise men all the way from the East, even unto Bethlehem." - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. ,  Parochial and Plain Sermons

       The Feast of St. Anthony the Abbot  is today. There is information on him  urlLink here.  "His doctrine surely was pure and unimpeachable; and his temper is high and heavenly,without cowardice, without gloom, without formality, and without self-complacency. Superstition is abject and crouching, it is full of thoughts of guilt; it distrusts God, and dreads the powers of evil. Antony at least has nothing of this, being full of holy confidence, divine peace, cheerfulness, and valorousness, be he (as some men may judge) ever so much an enthusiast.

       Humiliation   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "I have been honour'd and obey'd,       I have met scorn and slight;  And my heart loves earth's sober shade,       More than her laughing light.   For what is rule but a sad weight       Of duty and a snare?  What meanness, but with happier fate       The Saviour's Cross to share?   This my hid choice, if not from heaven,       Moves on the heavenward line;  Cleanse it, good Lord, from earthly leaven,       And make it simply Thine. "    Lazaret, Malta. January 16, 1833.

       From "Prospects of the Catholic Missioner"  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "We act according to our name; Catholics are at home in every time and place, in every state of society, in every class of the community, in every stage of cultivation. No state of things comes amiss to a Catholic priest; he has always a work to do, and a harvest to reap.  Were it otherwise, had he not confidence in the darkest day, and the most hostile district, he would be relinquishing a principal note, as it is called, of the Church. She is Catholic, because she brings a universal remedy for a universal disease. The disease is sin; all men have sinned; all men need a recovery in Christ; to all must that recovery be preached and dispensed. If then there be a preacher and dispenser of recovery, sent from God, that messenger must speak, not to one, but to all; he must be suited to all, he must have a mission to the whole race of Adam, and be cognisable by every individual of it. I do not mean that he must persuade all, and prevail with allfor that depends upon the will of each; but he must show his capabilities for converting all by actually converting some of every time, and every place, and every rank, and every age of life, and every character of mind. If sin is a partial evil, let its remedy be partial; but, if it be not local, not occasional, but universal, such must be the remedy. A local religion is not from God. The true religion must indeed begin, and may linger, in one place; nay, for centuries remain there, provided it is expanding and maturing in its internal character, and professes the while that it is not yet perfect. There may be deep reasons in God's counsels, why the proper revelation of His will to man should have been slowly elaborated and gradually completed in the elementary form of Judaism; but that Revelation was ever in progress in the Jewish period, and pointed by its prophets to a day when it should be spread over the whole earth. Judaism then was local because it was imperfect; when it reached perfection within, it became universal without, and took the name of Catholic."    Discourses to Mixed Congregations

       From   The Idea of a University     by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Knowledge is one thing, virtue is another; good sense is not conscience, refinement is not humility, nor is largeness and justness of view faith. Philosophy, however enlightened, however profound, gives no command over the passions, no influential motives, no vivifying principles. Liberal Education makes not the Christian, not the Catholic, but the gentleman. It is well to be a gentleman, it is well to have a cultivated intellect, a delicate taste, a candid, equitable, dispassionate mind, a noble and courteous bearing in the conduct of life;-these are the connatural qualities of a large knowledge; they are the objects of a University; I am advocating, I shall illustrate and insist upon them; but still, I repeat, they are no guarantee for sanctity or even for conscientiousness, they may attach to the man of the world, to the profligate, to the heartless,-pleasant, alas, and attractive as he shows when decked out in them. Taken by themselves, they do but seem to be what they are not; they look like virtue at a distance, but they are detected by close observers, and on the long run; and hence it is that they are popularly accused of pretence and hypocrisy, not, I repeat, from their own fault, but because their professors and their admirers persist in taking them for what they are not, and are officious in arrogating for them a praise to which they have no claim. Quarry the granite rock with razors, or moor the vessel with a thread of silk; then may you hope with such keen and delicate instruments as human knowledge and human reason to contend against those giants, the passion and the pride of man.

        From   The Present Position of Catholics in England   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "I allow there are true charges which can be brought against us; certainly, not only do I not deny it, but I hardly could deny it without heresy. I say distinctly, did I take upon me to deny everything which could be said against us, I should be proving too much, I should startle the Catholic theologian as well as Protestants; for what would it be but implying that the Church contains none within her pale but the just and holy? This was the heresy of the Novatians and Donatists of old time; it was the heresy of our Lollards, and others, such as Luther, who maintained that bad men are not members of the Church, that none but the predestinate are her members. But this no Catholic asserts, every Catholic denies. Every Catholic has ever denied it, back to the very time of the Apostles and their Divine Master; and He and they deny it. Christ denies it, St. Paul denies it, the Catholic Church denies it; our Lord expressly said that the Church was to be like a net, which gathered of every kind, not only of the good, but of the bad too. Such was His Church; it does not prove then that we are not His Church, because we are like His Church; rather our being like the Primitive Christian body, is a reason for concluding that we are one with it. We cannot make His Church better than He made her; we must be content with her as He made her, or not pretend to follow Him. He said, 'Many are called, few are chosen;' men come into the Church, and then they fall. They are not indeed sinning at the very time when they are brought into His family, at the time they are new born; but as children grow up, and converts live on, the time too frequently comes, when they fall under the power of one kind of temptation or other, and fall from grace, either for a while or for good. Thus, not indeed by the divine wish and intention, but by the divine permission, and man's perverseness, there is a vast load of moral evil existing in the Church; an enemy has sown weeds there, and those weeds remain among the wheat till the harvest. And this evil in the Church is not found only in the laity, but among the clergy too; there have been bad priests, bad bishops, bad monks, bad nuns, and bad Popes. If this, then, is the charge made against us, that we do not all live up to our calling, but that there are Catholics, lay and clerical, who may be proved to be worldly, revengeful, licentious, slothful, cruel, nay, may be unbelievers, we grant it at once. We not only grant it but we zealously maintain it. 'In a great house,' says St. Paul, there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.' There are, alas, plenty of children of the Church, who by their bad lives insult and disgrace their Mother.  The Church, it is true, has been promised many great things, but she has not been promised the souls of all her children. She is promised truth in religious teaching; she is promised duration to the end of the world; she is made the means of grace; she is unchangeable in Creed and in constitution; she will ever cover the earth; but her children are not infallible separately, any more than they are immortal; not indefectible, any more than they are ubiquitous. Therefore, if Protestants wish to form arguments which really would tell against us, they must show, not that individuals are immoral or profane, but that the Church teaches, or enjoins, or recommends, what is immoral or profane; rewards, encourages, or at least does not warn and discountenance, the sinner; or promulgates rules, and enforces practices, which directly lead to sin;and this indeed they try to do, but they find the task not near so pleasant as the short and easy method of adopting strong, round, thorough-going statements, which are not true.

       On January 11, 1850....  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. gave a catechetical instruction, of which the following notes survive.    Vitam Eternam- XIX  " 1. INTROD.-The Creed begins with God, it ends with ourselves; the last articles have reference to us.  2. Eternal life. Life means more than existence, for the lost live.  3. It means blessedness or beatitude; and this is called life, because there is no word which can fitly describe it; so we must use such words as occur.   4. By blessedness is meant our greatest good, and this from the nature of man can be nothing temporal, but must be something eternal. If a man thought his happiness to end, or were not sure, he would not be happy.  5. It consists in seeing God; not only seeing His glory, or a likeness of Him, but Himself. Since it is His nature or essence which will be seen, no likeness will do, for no likeness is there of His essence.  6. It is seen by means of the  lumen gloriae , which raises the soul above itself-'In Thy light shall we see light.' It is by an immediate union to God, and our intellect is raised above itself in order to it.  7. This light of glory raises the soul above itself. It [the soul] is what it is, but it is bathed and flooded with a heavenly light; it puts on a divine form, so that men are called gods. A red-hot iron, etc.  8. Such is essential blessedness-consisting in the possession of God. The soul ever sees God present, wherever it is-the rapturous nature of this privilege. We (most men) know so little of intellectual joys here, that few illustrations can be given. Most intense, yet continuous. (Happiness in itself-happiness of convalescence-happiness of tears; soothing, etc.-happiness of coming before the Blessed Sacrament-not happiness merely of success, etc., as on earth, i.e. of having gained, at possessing-saints' raptures.)  9. So much so that the soul could dispense with everything else-the blessed would not want friends from the earth. Each could well bear to lose the memory of everything else for God.  10. But God has added these additions: all the blessed will see each other, and rejoice in each other's glory,  11. And the honour of each other.  12. The glories of the heavenly palace.  13. Let this thought comfort us in the troubles of this life, and the prospect of purgatory. "

       The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord  is today.  "You know that God had appointed John, the son of Zachary and Elizabeth, as the Forerunner charged to announce to the Jews the coming of the Incarnate Word.   After a life given up to austerity and when in about his thirtieth year, John, urged by divine inspiration, had begun his teaching upon the banks of the Jordan. All his teaching was summed up in these words: 'Do penance; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand' (Matth. III, 2). To these urgent exhortations he joined baptism in the river, thereby to show his hearers the necessity of purifying their souls in order to render them less unworthy of the Saviours coming. This baptism was only conferred on those who acknowledged themselves to be sinners and confessed their faults.   Now, one day when the Precursor administered 'baptism for the remission of sins' (Marc. I, 4; Luc. III, 2), Christ Jesus, Whose hour had come to leave the obscurity of the Hidden Life and manifest the Divine secrets to the world, mingled with the multitude of sinners and came with them to receive from John the purifying ablution.   When we ponder on this thought that He Who thus proclaims Himself a sinner and voluntarily presents Himself to receive the baptism of penance, is the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, before Whom the Angels veil their faces, singing, Holy, holy, holy" (Isa. VI, 3), we are confounded at such a prodigious abasement.   The Apostle tells us that Christ is holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners (Hebr. VII, 26), and here Jesus Himself comes asking baptism for the remission of sins! What is this mystery?   It is that in all His states, the Word Incarnate fills a double office: that of the Son of God, in virtue of His Eternal generation, and that of the head of a fallen race whose nature He has taken, and this race He has come to redeem.   As Son of God, He can claim to sit on the right hand of His Father and enjoy the glory and splendour of heaven.   But as Head of fallen humanity, having taken flesh, guilty in the rest of the human race, although wholly pure in Him, In similitudinem carnis peccati (Rom. VIII, 3), He can enter Heaven at the head of this mystical body only after having passed through the humiliations of His life and the sufferings of His Passion:  Nonne haec oportuit pati Christum, et ita intrare in gloriam suam  (Luc. XXIV, 26)?   Possessing the Divine nature, says St. Paul, Christ thought it not robbery to declare Himself equal to God in perfection (Cf. Philipp. II, 6.); but for us, for our salvation, He descended into the depths of humiliation; and, on this account, the Father exalted Him, giving Him the name of Jesus which signifies our redemption; in exalting His Son, the Father has raised us up together with Him to the heights of heaven:  Consedere fecit [nos] in caelestibus  (Ephes. II, 6). It is truly to prepare the way before us that Christ enters into heaven:  Ubi praecursor pro nobis introivit Jesus  (Hebr. VI, 20).   However He will enter there only after having, by His Blood, paid off all our debt to Divine Justice:  Per proprium sanguinem introivit... in sancta, aeterna redemptione inventa  (Ibid. IX, 12).

       On January 23, 1875...  the Reverend Charles Kingsley went to his reward. While a noted novelist and essayist in his time, what fame he has now mostly rests on some incredibly insulting words he flung out in an anonymus article....   "Truth, for its own sake, had never been a virtue with the Roman clergy. Father Newman informs us that it need not, and on the whole ought not to be; that cunning is the weapon which Heaven has given to the saints wherewith to withstand the brute male force of the wicked world which marries and is given in marriage. Whether his notion be doctrinally correct or not, it is at least historically so."   Rev. Kingsley's refusal to properly retract this outrageous statement led to the writing and publication of   urlLink Apologia Pro Vita Sua , the book considered by most to be  the  masterpiece in the many volumes written by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   The Venerable himself wrote a comment on Kingsley' death, in a letter to a friend.  'As to Mr. Kingsley, much less could I feel any resentment against him when he was accidentally the instrument, in the good Providence of God, by whom I had an opportunity given me, which otherwise I should not have had, of vindicating my character and conduct in my "Apologia." I heard, too, a few years back from a friend that she chanced to go into Chester Cathedral and found Mr. K. preaching about me, kindly though, of course, with criticisms on me. And it has rejoiced me to observe lately that he was defending the Athanasian Creed, and, as it seemed to me, in his views generally nearing the Catholic view of things. I have always hoped that by good luck I might meet him, feeling sure that there would be no embarrassment on my part, and I said Mass for his soul as soon as I heard of his death. 'Most truly yours, JOHN H. NEWMAN.'

       Quiz time...     You belong to the kindred of the Noldor.  Their tale is one of great tragedy and heavy burdens. Great craftsmen possessing vast knowledge, it was Feanor, son of the High King Finwe,  who forged the Silmarils.  After they were stolen by Morgoth, and Finwe slain, Feanor and his sons pledged a terrible oath to reclaim the Silmarils from whosoever possesed them at any cost.  The Noldor then left Aman and returned to Middle Earth, slaying their own kin in the process.  They were doomed to fight a futile war against Morgoth's armies and a great majority of them were slain.    urlLink   Which Race of Elves from The Silmarillion are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    My full 'online name' is actually  N&acirc;rwen o herth o F&euml;anor - N&acirc;rwen of the House of F&euml;anor-which would make me not only Noldo, but of the most 'difficult' of the Noldor's three branches.

It would seem that Balrogs do have wings. The Professor states 'the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings' and 'its wings were spread from wall to wall'  ii Further, a Balrog is, like a Dragon, an evil creature associated with the element of fire, and it is clear to everyone that Dragons do have wings.  I assert that Balrogs do not have wings. For, it is a natural impulse to act to preserve one's life, and in doing so, to make full use of one's capabilities. If the Balrog did have wings, it would not allow itself to fall to its death in the mines of Moria, but save itself by the use of its wings  Reply to Objection i. It is clear from usage that the Professor was using a metaphor here, and not being literally descriptive  Reply to Objection ii. Dragons and Balrogs are alike in that they are both servants of evil and of flame, but they differ in their accidential traits. Because two things are alike in one way, it is not proper to argue they are alike in other ways.

       The Feast of St. Vincent of Saragossa, Deacon and Martyr  is today. There is information on him  urlLink here.   It is also the feast of his bishop,  urlLink  St. Valerius of Saragossa . In addition, this day is also the feast of  urlLink three   urlLink other    urlLink saints  named Vincent. (To any Pallottines out there, happy feast day !) There are also three  beati  commemorated this day-  urlLink Blessed William Joseph Chaminade ,  urlLink Blessed William Patenson  and  urlLink Blessed Laura Vicuna . The last is particularly interesting as she was a young girl who was a victim of her mother's sinful lifestyle- appropriate on this day when we in the United States must mourn slaughtered innocents.

       Arrgh!   The  urlLink Confederation website  adds  urlLink a series of letters by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., on the Oratorian vocation - but it only posts them in  Italian  ! Wouldn't it make sense to post them in the language they were  written  in, as well as in translation ? Oh, well, it gives me an excuse to send the folks at the Confederation yet another "why can't you make the site available in other languages ?  " e-mail...

       The January 2004  First Things    is now  urlLink online.  I was particularly struck by this short article by Fr. Neuhaus.   A  New York Times  story refers to the war in Sudan as a 'pet cause of many American religious conservatives.'Imagine, writes Allen Hertzke, political scientist at the University of Oklahoma, the Times describing the plight of Soviet Jewry as a 'pet cause' of American Jews or apartheid in South Africa as a 'pet cause' of African Americans. For twenty years, the civil war in Sudan has killed two million people, displaced five million, and revived the slave trade. The war is between the Islamic regime in Khartoum and the mainly Christian south of Sudan. Under intense pressure from Christian human rights groups in this country, a pact has recently been signed that may end the war. One might think that would be headline news, but it is buried in the back pages, if it is reported at all. After all, it is only a pet cause of religious conservatives.

       On January 19, 1851  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive.  " On the Name of Jesus 1. It has been from the beginning the order of Providencenay, even  verbum not to create without giving a name. As grace is necessary to keep things together lest they dissipate, so a name is, as it were, the crown of the work, as giving it a meaning and description, and, as it were, registering it before Him. Henceforth it lives in His sight, as being in His  catalogue .  2. Thus 'day' and 'night,' 'earth' and 'seas.' Hence Adam named his wife and the beasts, etc. Hence Abraham's name changed; Jacob's, Sarah's, Isaac's; Isaac's given, Jacob's changed; St. John Baptist; St. Peter and St. Paul. These names are descriptive.  3. Hence anxiety of men to know God's name. They are born in ignorance. They have a sense there is a God, but what is He? The heavens and earth do not condense and concentrate His manifold attributes, etc. They give hints, glimpses, snatches, but what is He? Hence He is the unknown God, and men are but 'feeling after Him' by what they see. They are in God; He surrounds them, but they want to gaze on Him objectively.   4. Thus Jacob about the angel, 'What is thy name?' And to Manue, 'Why askest thou my name, which is  mirabile ?' Judg. xiii. 18. Moses bolder. God had been called 'God of Abraham,' etc.  Adonai .  5. Hence you see a meaning why the Eternal Son would reveal this, that the Name of that Son was of consequence; it was a manifestation of the nature and attributes of GodAdmirabilis, Isa. ix. 6 ; Emmanuel, Isa. vii. 14. Still, however, the name was not told. At length Gabriel said it, Luke i. 31; circumcision, Luke ii. 21; angel to Joseph, Matt. i. 21, His name was called Jesus. And hence the devils: 'Jesus the Son of God'; 'I know thee who thou art.' On the cross. The first miracle of St. Peter and St. John, Acts iii.'in the name,' 'this name,' 'no other name'and St. Paul in Phil. ii. 8-11 . The two great apostles, the angels from Gabriel, devils from the possessed, and men from the circumcision.  6. For in this the whole history of salvation, the whole creedhow God would save men, how He loved them, etc., recounting the Christian doctrine . Thus when we would know who God is, we answer, Jesus. We see God in the clouds, in the mountains, etc., and who is He? Jesus. Who then rules? Who is looking, the ruler of bad men? Who is looking, the guardian of the virtuous? Who, etc.? and we answer, Jesus. He is the one word containing in itself all power, etc., because in it we thereby have in our minds the full description of Almighty God.  7. And in it an answer to all objections and difficulties. It surpasses all (this is the point of the sermon): whatever difficulties, whatever mysteries in religion, this comprehends and protects them. What is more wonderful than that God should become man. Real Presence, power of Mary, purgatory, eternal punishment, intercession of saints, election, original sin. The whole Catholic system bound up in it.  8. Hence, and since Protestants have the name of Jesus on their lips, it is the test whether or not they understand it, i.e. their taking Catholic doctrine or not. If they don't, if they stumble at it, they don't understand Jesus. On invincible ignorance, as alone hindering Catholicism.  9. Let us then rejoice in the fulness of this Name. Let us use it as the Name of virtue against devils, bad thoughts, evil men, the world, dangers and frights. It is our banner. "

       From  Sermons on Subjects of the Day    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " Nay, may we not say that our Lord Himself had commenced His ministry, that is, bade farewell to His earthly home, at a feast? for it was at the marriage entertainment at Cana of Galilee that He did His first miracle, and manifested forth His glory. He was in the house of friends, He was surrounded by intimates and followers, and He took a familiar interest in the exigencies of the feast. He supplied a principal want which was interfering with their festivity. It was His contribution to it. By supplying it miraculously He showed that He was beginning a new life, the life of a Messenger from God, and that that feast was the last scene of the old life. And, moreover, He made use of one remarkable expression, which seems to imply that this change of condition really was in His thoughts, if we may dare so to speak of them, or at all to interpret them. For when His Mother said unto Him, 'They have no wine,' He answered, 'What have I to do with thee?' [ John ii. 3, 4.]  He had had to do with her for thirty years. She had borne Him, she had nursed Him, she had taught Him. And when He had reached twelve years old, at the age when the young may expect to be separated from their parents, He had only become more intimately one with them, for we are told that 'He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them.'  [Luke ii. 51.]  Eighteen years had passed away since this occurred. St. Joseph (as it seems) had been taken to his rest. Mary remained; but from Mary, His Mother, He must now part, for the three years of His ministry. He had gently intimated this to her at the very time of His becoming subject to her, intimated that His heavenly Father's work was a higher call than any earthly duty. 'Wist ye not,' He said, when found in the Temple, 'that I must be about My Father's business?'  [Luke ii. 49.]  The time was now come when this was to be fulfilled, and, therefore, when His Mother addressed Him at the marriage feast, He answered, 'What have I to do with thee?' What is between Me and thee, My Mother, any longer? 'The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand.' [Mark i. 15.]  "

       On January 29, 1868  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. wrote the following. It was (relatively) soon after the  Apologia Pro Vita Sua  had restored much of his reputation and influence- though not with everyone, as the letter itself shows.    "Our Lord has said: " Vae cum benedixerint vobis homines " (Luc. vi. 26), [ alos humas eiposi ], and I seem to be in this danger as regards the Protestant world. A reaction has set in, nor does one know what will be its limits. Just now, my Verses, which I have collected and published, have both stimulated and manifested it. I feel as if a Nemesis would come, if I am not careful and am reminded of the ring of Polycrates. Friends and well-wishers out of kindness are writing favourable reviews of my small book, and I am obliged to read out of gratitude what they say of me so generously. I have said: 'the Protestant world'but it extends to the great mass of (English speaking) Catholics also; till the 'Apologia' I was thought 'passé'and forgotten. The controversy which occasioned it, and then the Oxford matter and the 'Dream of Gerontius' have brought me out, and now I should be hard indeed to please, and very ungrateful to them, and to God, if I did not duly appreciate this thought of me.  Then comes the question: what use can I make of these fresh mercies? Not from any supernatural principle, but from mere natural temper, I keep saying, what is the good of all this? what comes of it? 'Vanitas Vanitatum,' if it is but empty praise. What use can I make of it? for what is it given me? And then, too, on the other hand, when I am well thought of, and the world is in good humour with me, I am led to say to myself: "Let well alone; do not hazard by any fresh act the loss of that, which you have been so long without, and found such difficulty in getting. Enjoy the 'otium cum dignitate.'  'Otium cum dignitate' reminds me of 'Otium cum indignitate'; yes, as far as Propaganda goes, and that English party of which Archbishop Manning and Ward are the support, I have been dismissed not simply as 'inglorious,' but to 'dishonoured ease.' And this would certainly serve as the ring of Polycrates, did I feel itbut I don't feel it. And, as I had said on some former page, I should be so out of my element if I were without that cold shade on the side of ecclesiastical authority, in which I have dwelt nearly all my life, my eyes would be so dazed, and my limbs so relaxed, were I brought out to bask in the full sun of ecclesiastical favour, that I should not know how to act and should make a fool of myself.  As my Lord had some purpose in letting me be so long forgotten and calumniated, as He has had some purpose in leaving me, as regards ecclesiastical authorities, under that cloud which He has lately removed from me as regards Catholics and Protestants generally, so now He has some purpose in that late removalif I could know what it is...."

       Just because ...  In 1850, a certain lady who corresponded with Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  wrote to him that a friend of hers considered him to be a saint. His reply was, IMHO, priceless.   "You must undeceive Miss A. B. about me, though I suppose she uses words in a general sense. I have nothing of a saint about me as every one knows, and it is a severe (and salutary) mortification to be thought next door to one. I may have a high view of many things, but it is the consequence of education and a peculiar cast of intellect-but this is very different from  being  what I admire. I have no tendency to be a saint-it is a sad thing to say so. Saints are not literary men, they do not love the classics, they do not write Tales. I may be well enough in my way, but it is not the 'high line.' People ought to feel this, most people do. But those who are at a distance have exalted notions about one. It is enough for me to black the saints' shoes-if St. Philip uses blacking in heaven. "

       On January 27, 1850  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  preached a sermon, of which the following notes  survive:   On Labour and Rest   "1. INTROD.-On Septuagesima, beginning a time of penance and penitential work. No more Alleluias. The colour purple.  2. Labour is the lot, the punishment of man. Bad and good labour, nay, evil labours and virtue labours.  3. It is otherwise as God made things. There is motion and activity in Nature, but it is  without effort ; all creation is as it were hung upon wheels, and moves noiselessly and gracefully?the sun, the stream, the breeze, life.  4. And so in paradise. Adam's tending the flowers was but a specimen of divine labour without effort; such, too, was his service of God; such the angels' service-without effort.  5. But sin has made things otherwise. Henceforth labour changes its character. It is no longer Eden, but that vineyard into which the labourers were sent in today's gospel-to pull out stones, to destroy the weeds, worms, blights'-and a wall round it?for there is a warfare. Labour is a war and aims at conquest.  6. Take bodily labour, labour of the field-preparing the earth, felling trees, making roads, canals-then building houses; it is all penitential, all the punishment of sin-the mind does not come in, but a weariness.  7. And much more with  intellectual   labour and the labour of the mind-the mere wear and tear of  business; the necessity of providing for a family; anxiety, suspense, fear, failure, dreariness and hopelessness. But even when successful, one enterprise leads to another, till the mind is overburdened and overwrought, and is sucked into a vortex. Most engrossing; no time for the thought of religion; religion must take its chance, and that they feel.  8. Much more sin; the bondage and service of the devil most wearisome-the drunkard, the sensualist. (I knew one who was tempted to fatalism.) Wearing, restless feeling, even when they call themselves happy.  9. Nay, virtue here is too a toil, because there is war between good and evil. Read the saints' lives. Such is labour, and it wearies soul and body. The body shows it. whether it is manual, mental, or intellectual.  10. Oh! if we must labour, let us labour in the service of the Great Master of the Vineyard-that only pays, that only has hire. Then we shall labour that we may rest, then only. Sin never rests; there is no rest in hell. This is that penny which they one and all received, because nothing better or higher.  11. When the evening of life comes, then shall we know most fully the meaning of labour by being freed from it.  12. The blessedness of rest, of freedom from sin and toil, even though in purgatory. Purgatory is rest compared with this life.  13. And much more in heaven, where we see the face of God. "

       For Friday  " Let us suppose that some aged and venerable person whom we have known as long as we could recollect any thing, and loved and reverenced, suppose such a one, who had often done us kindnesses, who had taught us, who had given us good advice, who had encouraged us, smiled on us, comforted us in trouble, whom we knew to be very good and religious, very holy, full of wisdom, full of heaven, with grey hairs and awful countenance, waiting for Almighty God's summons to leave this world for a better place; suppose, I say, such a one whom we have ourselves known, and whose memory is dear to us, rudely seized by fierce men, stripped naked in public, insulted, driven about here and there, made a laughing-stock, struck, spit on, dressed up in other clothes in ridicule, then severely scourged on the back, then laden with some heavy load till he could carry it no longer, pulled and dragged about, and at last exposed with all his wounds to the gaze of a rude multitude who came and jeered him, what would be our feelings? Let us in our mind think of this person or that, and consider how we should be overwhelmed and pierced through and through by such a hideous occurrence.  But what is all this to the suffering of the holy Jesus, which we bear to read of as a matter of course! Only think of Him, when in His wounded state, and without garment on, He had to creep up the ladder, as He could, which led Him up the cross high enough for His murderers to nail Him to it; and consider  Who  it was that was in that misery. Or again, view Him dying, hour after hour bleeding to death; and how? in peace? no; with His arms stretched out, and His face exposed to view, and any one who pleased coming and staring at Him, mocking Him, and watching the gradual ebbing of His strength, and the approach of death. These are some of the appalling details which the Gospels contain, and surely they were not recorded for nothing; but that we might dwell on them.

       Carl Olson  writes good articles. Here are two of them.  One is on the  urlLink inseparability of Our Lord from His Church  and the other is on  urlLink the phenomenon of 'un-church'   .  A comment on the second article: the suggestion that a prospective convert make up his own 'church' rather than swim the Tiber is not quite as avant-garde as it may sound. In Venerable John Henry Newman's  last, difficult stages of his journey into the Church, his  younger brother Francis opined in a letter that joining a body as weak and despised as the Roman Catholic Church in England would be pointless and that his brother would be much better off making up a 'church' himself. The Venerable kept the letter, and wrote upon it the rather exasperated marginal comment, "That I could be contemplating questions of Truth & Falsehood never entered his imagination!" .

       For Thursday  I think I've quoted this before, but it certainly bears repeating... "The world cannot believe that Catholics really hold what they profess to hold; and supposes that, if they are educated men, they are kept up to their profession by external influence, by superstitious fear, by pride, by interest, or other bad or unworthy motive. Men of the world have never believed in their whole life, never have had simple faith in things unseen, never have had more than an opinion about them, that they might be true and might be false, but probably were true, or doubtless were true; and in consequence they think an absolute, unhesitating faith in anything unseen to be simply an extravagance, and especially when it is exercised on objects which they do not believe themselves, or even reject with scorn or abhorrence. And hence they prophesy that the Catholic Church must lose, in proportion as men are directed to the sober examination of their own thoughts and feelings, and to the separation of what is real and true from what is a matter of words and pretence. They cannot understand how our faith in the Blessed Sacrament is a genuine, living portion of our minds; they think it a mere profession which we embrace with no inward assent, but only because we are told that we should be lost unless we profess it; or because, the Catholic Church having in dark ages committed herself to it, we cannot help ourselves, though we would if we could, and therefore receive it by constraint, from a sense of duty towards our cause, or in a spirit of party. They will not believe that we would not gladly get rid of the doctrine of transubstantiation, as a heavy stone about our necks, if we could. What shocking words to use! It would be wrong to use them, were they not necessary to make you understand, my brethren, the privilege which you have, and the world has not. Shocking indeed and most profane! a relief to rid ourselves of the doctrine that Jesus is on our Altars! as well say a relief to rid ourselves of the belief that Jesus is God, to rid ourselves of the belief that there is a God. Yes, that I suppose is the true relief, to believe nothing at all, or, at least, not to be bound to believe anything; to believe first one thing, then another; to believe what we please for as long as we please; that is, not really to believe, but to have an opinion about everything, and let nothing sit close upon us, to commit ourselves to nothing, to keep the unseen world altogether at a distance. But if we are to believe anything at all, if we are to make any one heavenly doctrine our own, if we are to take some dogmas as true, why, in that case, it should be a burden to believe what is so gracious and what so concerns us, rather than what is less intimate and less winning,-why we must not believe that God is among us, if God there is, why we may not believe that God dwells on our Altars as well as that He dwells in the sky, certainly is not so self-evident, but that we have a claim to ask the reasons for it of those, who profess to be so rational and so natural in their determinations. O my brethren, how narrow-minded is this world at bottom after all, in spite of its pretences and in spite of appearances! Here you see, it cannot by a stretch of imagination conceive that anything exists, of which it has not cognisance in its own heart; it will not admit into its imagination the mere idea that we have faith, because it does not know what faith is from experience, and it will not admit that there is anything in the mind of man which it does not experience itself, for that would be all one with admitting after all that there is such a thing as a mystery. It must know, it must be the measure of all things; and so in self-defence it considers us hypocritical, as professing what we cannot believe, lest it should be forced to confess itself blind. 'Behold what manner of love the Father had bestowed on us, that we should be named, and should be, the sons of God; therefore the world knoweth not us, because it knoweth not Him!' "- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  Discourses to Mixed Congregations

       From  A Letter Addressed to the Duke of Norfolk on Occasion of Mr. Gladstone's Recent Expostulation    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Our Divine Master might have communicated to us heavenly truths without telling us that they came from Him, as it is commonly thought He has done in the case of heathen nations; but He willed the Gospel to be a revelation acknowledged and authenticated, to be public, fixed, and permanent; and accordingly, as Catholics hold, He framed a Society of men to be its home, its instrument, and its guarantee. The rulers of that Association are the legal trustees, so to say, of the sacred truths which He spoke to the Apostles by word of mouth. As He was leaving them, He gave them their great commission, and bade them 'teach' their converts all over the earth, 'to observe all things whatever He had commanded them;' and then He added, 'Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.'  Here, first, He told them to 'teach' His revealed Truth; next, 'to the consummation of all things;' thirdly, for their encouragement, He said that He would be with them 'all days,' all along, on every emergency or occasion, until that consummation. They had a duty put upon them of teaching their Master's words, a duty which they could not fulfil in the perfection which fidelity required, without His help; therefore came His promise to be with them in their performance of it. Nor did that promise of supernatural help end with the Apostles personally, for He adds, 'to the consummation of the world,' implying that the Apostles would have successors, and engaging that He would be with those successors as He had been with them.  The same safeguard of the Revelation?viz. an authoritative, permanent tradition of teaching, is insisted on by an informant of equal authority with St. Matthew, but altogether independent of him, I mean St. Paul. He calls the Church 'the pillar and ground of the Truth;' and he bids his convert Timothy, when he had become a ruler in that Church, to 'take heed unto his doctrine,' to 'keep the deposit' of the faith, and to 'commit' the things which he had heard from himself 'to faithful men who should be fit to teach others.'  This is how Catholics understand the Scripture record, nor does it appear how it can otherwise be understood; but, when we have got as far as this, and look back, we find that we have by implication made profession of a further doctrine. For, if the Church, initiated in the Apostles and continued in their successors, has been set up for the direct object of protecting, preserving, and declaring the Revelation, and that, by means of the Guardianship and Providence of its Divine Author, we are led on to perceive that, in asserting this, we are in other words asserting, that, so far as the message entrusted to it is concerned, the Church is infallible; for what is meant by infallibility in teaching but that the teacher in his teaching is secured from error? and how can fallible man be thus secured except by a supernatural infallible guidance? And what can have been the object of the words, 'I am with you all along to the end,' but to give thereby an answer by anticipation to the spontaneous, silent alarm of the feeble company of fishermen and labourers, to whom they were addressed, on their finding themselves laden with superhuman duties and responsibilities?

       Three important things happened on this date..  Important to me, anyway.  On February 2, 1848, the  urlLink Birmingham Oratory  was officially founded. Prayers for vocations to that particular House, and for the canonization of  urlLink their founder and first Provost  would be most welcome.  On February 2, 1979, a young man by the name of Drew Morgan moved into the Pittsburgh Oratory. Happy anniversary, Fr. Drew ! I pray that your next 25 years at the Oratory are even more blessed than the first 25 ! Finally,  urlLink Gerard Serafin  reminds us that on February 2, 1594, the great musician Giovanni Pierlugi da Palestrina went to his reward. Besides being, IMHO, one of the finest composers ever, he was very much a friend to the early Oratorians and often wrote music for the Oratory's gatherings. Our founder,  urlLink St. Philip Neri  , though elderly and ailing himself, rushed to Palestrina's bedside to give him the Last Sacraments.

       Again, just because  " This is the love which you, my brethren, must have in your measure, if you would have a good hope of salvation. For you were once sinners; either by open and avowed contempt of religion, or by secret transgression, or by carelessness and coldness, or by some indulged bad habit, or by setting your heart on some object of this world, and doing your own will instead of God's, I think I may say you have needed, or now need, a reconciliation to Him. You have needed, or you need, to be brought near to Him, and to have your sins washed away in His blood, and your pardon recorded in Heaven. And what will do this for you, but contrition? and what is contrition without love? I do not say that you must have the love which Saints have, in order to your forgiveness, the love of St. Peter or of St. Mary Magdalen; but still without your portion of that same heavenly grace, how can you be forgiven at all? If you would do works meet for penance, they must proceed from a living flame of charity. If you would secure perseverance to the end, you must gain it by continual loving prayer to the Author and Finisher of faith and obedience. If you would have a good prospect of His acceptance of you in your last moments, still it is love alone which secures His love, and blots out sin. My brethren, at that awful hour you may be unable to obtain the last Sacraments; death may come on you suddenly, or you may be at a distance from a Priest. You may be thrown on yourselves, simply on your own compunction of heart, your own repentance, your own resolutions of amendment. You may have been weeks and weeks at a distance from spiritual aid; you may have to meet your God without the safeguard, the compensation, the mediation of any holy rite; and oh! what will save you at such disadvantage, but the exercise of divine love 'poured over your hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to you' ? At that hour nothing but a firm habit of charity, which has kept you from mortal sins, or a powerful act of charity which blots them out, will be of any avail to you. Nothing but charity can enable you to live well or to die well. How can you bear to lie down at night, how can you bear to go a journey, how can you bear the presence of pestilence, or the attack of ever so slight an indisposition, if you are ill provided in yourselves with divine love against that change, which will come on you some day, yet when and how you know not? Alas! how will you present yourselves before the judgment-seat of Christ, with the imperfect mixed feelings which now satisfy you, with a certain amount of faith, and trust, and fear of God's judgments, but with nothing of that real delight in Him, in His attributes, in His will, in His commandments, in His service, which Saints possess in such fulness, and which alone can give the soul a comfortable title to the merits of His death and passion?  How different is the feeling with which the loving soul, on its separation from the body, approaches the judgment-seat of its Redeemer! It knows how great a debt of punishment remains upon it, though it has for many years been reconciled to Him; it knows that purgatory lies before it, and that the best it can reasonably hope for is to be sent there. But to see His face, though for a moment! to hear His voice, to hear Him speak, though it be to punish! O Saviour of men, it says, I come to Thee, though it be in order to be at once remanded from Thee; I come to Thee who art my Life and my All; I come to Thee on the thought of whom I have lived all my life long. To Thee I gave myself when first I had to take a part in the world; I sought Thee for my chief good early, for early didst Thou teach me, that good elsewhere there was none. Whom have I in heaven but Thee? whom have I desired on earth, whom have I had on earth, but Thee? whom shall I have amid the sharp flame but Thee? Yea, though I be now descending thither, into 'a land desert, pathless and without water,' I will fear no ill, for Thou art with me. I have seen Thee this day face to face, and it sufficeth; I have seen Thee, and that glance of Thine is sufficient for a century of sorrow, in the nether prison. I will live on that look of Thine, though I see Thee not, till I see Thee again, never to part from Thee. That eye of Thine shall be sunshine and comfort to my weary, longing soul; that voice of Thine shall be everlasting music in my ears. Nothing can harm me, nothing shall discompose me: I will bear the appointed years, till the end comes, bravely and sweetly. I will raise my voice, and chant a perpetual Confiteor to Thee and to Thy Saints in that dreary valley;'to God Omnipotent, and to the Blessed Mary Ever-Virgin,' (Thy Mother and mine, immaculate in her conception), 'and to blessed Michael Archangel,' (created in his purity by the very hand of God), and 'to Blessed John Baptist,' (sanctified even in his mother's womb); and after these three, 'to the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul,' (penitents, who compassionate the sinner from their experience of sin); 'to all Saints,' (whether they have lived in contemplation or in toil, during the days of their pilgrimage), to all Saints will I address my supplication, that they may 'remember me, since it is well with them, and do mercy by me, and make mention of me unto the King that He bring me out of prison'. And then at length 'God shall wipe away every tear from my eyes, and death shall be no longer, nor mourning, nor crying, nor pain any more, for the former things are passed away' " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. ,   Discourses to Mixed Congregations

       Since the Readings at daily Mass    have been about King Solomon recently, I think the following may be helpful: "Who was so variously gifted, so inwardly endowed, so laden with external blessings, as Solomon? on whom are lavished, as on him, the titles and the glories of the Eternal Son, God and man? The only aspect of Christ's adorable Person, which his history does not represent, does but bring out to us the peculiarity of his privileges. He does not symbolise Christ's sufferings; he was neither a priest, nor, like David his father, had he been a man of strife and toil and blood. Everything which betokens mortality, everything which savours of the fall, is excluded from our idea of Solomon. He is as if an ideal of perfection; the king of peace, the builder of the temple, the father of a happy people, the heir of an empire, the wonder of all nations; a prince, yet a sage; palace-bred, yet taught in the schools; a student, yet a man of the world; deeply read in human nature, yet learned too in animals and plants. He has the crown without the cross, peace without war, experience without suffering; and all this is not in the mere way of men, or from the general providence of God, but vouchsafed to him from the very hands of his Creator, by a particular designation, and as the result of inspiration. He obtained it when young; and where shall we find anything so touching in the whole of Scripture as the circumstances of his obtaining? who shall accuse him of want of religious fear and true love, whose dawning is so beautiful? When the Almighty appeared to him in a dream on his coming to the throne and said, 'Ask what I shall give thee;' 'O Lord God,' he made answer, 'Thou hast made Thy servant king instead of David my father; and I am but a child, and know not how to go out and come in. And Thy servant is in the midst of the people which Thou hast chosen, an immense people, which cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.' Accordingly, he asked for nothing else but the gift of wisdom to enable him to govern his people well; and as his reward for so excellent a petition, he received, not only the wisdom for which he had asked, but those other gifts for which he had not asked: 'And the Lord said unto Solomon, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, nor riches, nor the lives of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself wisdom to discern judgment, behold I have done to thee according to thy words, and I have given to thee a wise and understanding heart, so that none has been like thee before thee, nor shall rise after thee. Yea, and the things also, which thou didst not ask, I have given to thee, to wit, riches and glory, so that none has been like to thee among the kings in all days heretofore.'  Rare inauguration to his greatness! the most splendid of monarchs owes nothing to injustice, or to cruelty, or to violence, or to treachery, nothing to human art or to human arm, that he is so powerful, so famous, and so wise; it is a divine gift which endued him within, which clothed him without. What was wanting to his blessedness? seeking God in his youth, growing up year after year in sanctity, fortifying his faith by wisdom, and his obedience by experience, and his aspirations by habit, what shall he not be in the next world, who is so glorious in this? He is a Saint ready made; he is in his youth what others are in their age; he is fit for heaven ere others begin the way heavenward: why should he delay? what lacks he yet? why tarry the wheels of his chariot? why does he remain longer on earth, when he has already won his crown, and may be carried away in a happy youth, and be securely taken into God's keeping, not with the common throng of holy souls, but, like Enoch and Elias, passing his long mysterious ages up on high, in some fit secret paradise till the day of redemption? Alas! he remains on earth to show us that there might be one thing lacking amidst that multitude of graces; to show that though there be in a man all faith, all hope, all love, all wisdom, though there be an exuberance of merits, it is all but a vanity, it is only a woe in the event, if one gift be wanting,the gift of perseverance! He was in his youth, what others hardly are in age; well were it, had he been in his end, what the feeblest of God's servants is in his beginning!  His great father, whose sanctity had been wrought into him by many a fight with Satan, and who knew how difficult it was to persevere, when his death drew near, as if in prophecy rather than in prayer, had spoken thus of and to his son and his people: 'God said to me, Thou shalt not build a house to My name, because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood; Solomon, thy son, shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to Me for a son, and I will be to him a father; and I will establish his kingdom even for ever, if he shall persevere to do My precepts and judgments, as at this day. And thou, Solomon, my son, know the God of thy father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and a willing mind, for if thou shalt forsake Him, He will cast thee off for ever.' And then, when he had collected together the precious materials for that house which he himself was not to build, and was resigning the kingdom to his son, 'I know,' he said, 'O my God, that Thou provest hearts, and lovest simplicity, wherefore, have I in the simplicity of my heart and with joy offered to Thee all these things; and Thy people too, which are present here, have I seen with great joy to offer to Thee their gifts. O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep for ever this will of our hearts, and let this mind remain always for the worship of Thee. And to Solomon also, my son, give a perfect heart, that he may keep Thy commandments, and Thy testimonies, and Thy ceremonies, and do all things, and build the building for the which I have provided the charges.'  Such had been the dim foreboding of the father, fearing perhaps for his son from the very abundance of that son's prosperity. And in truth, it is not good for a man to live in so cloudless a splendour, and under so unchequered a heaven. There is a moral in the history, that he who prefigured the coming Saviour in all His offices but that of suffering, should fall; that the King and the Prophet, who was neither Priest nor Warrior, should come short;-thereby to show that penance is the only sure mother of love. 'They who sow in tears shall reap in exultation;' but Solomon, like the flowers of the field which are so beautiful, yet are cast into the oven, so he too, with all his glory, retained not his comeliness, but withered in his place. He who was wisest became as the most brutish; he who was the most devout was lifted up and fell; he who wrote the Song of Songs became the slave and the prey of vile affections. 'King Solomon loved many strange women, unto them he clave with the most burning love. And when he was now old, his heart was depraved by women, to follow other gods, Astarte, goddess of the Sidonians, and Moloch the idol of the Ammonites; and so did he for all his strange wives, who did burn incense and sacrifice unto their gods.' O, what a contrast between that grey-headed apostate, laden with years and with sins, bowing down to women and to idols, and the bright and youthful form standing, on the day of Dedication, in the Temple he had built, as a mediator between God and his people, when he acknowledged so simply, so fervently, God's mercies and God's faithfulness, and prayed that He would 'incline their hearts unto Himself, that they might walk in all His ways, and keep His commandments, and His ceremonies, and His judgments, whatever He had commanded to their fathers!'  Well were it for us, my dear brethren, were it only kings and prophets and sages, and other rare creations of God's grace, to whom this warning applied; but it applies to all of us. It is indeed most true that the holier a man is, and the higher in the kingdom of heaven, so much the greater need has he to look carefully to his footing, lest he stumble and be lost; and a deep conviction of this necessity has been the sole preservation of the Saints." - Venerable John Henry Newman,C.O., "Perserverance in Grace",  Discourses to Mixed Congregations

Second, a friend has asked for prayers for a woman he knows. She asked him what he thought about abortion, and after he had told her that it is a horror that kills babies and leaves women devastated, she revealed that she is pregnant and considering having an abortion herself. Prayers for this troubled mother and for the safety of her unborn child are urgently needed.

        On February 9, 1851   Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:   On the Descent into Egypt  "1. INTROD.There is one subject not much thought of, the descent into Egypt, though belonging to this season, and it may be accounted one of  the Epiphanies of Christ. (1) Magi; (2) purification; (3) idol-breaking in Egypt, for as the Ark levelling the walls of Jericho, and [overthrowing] Dagon, so much more Christ.  2. Circumstances. How one journey to Bethlehemthen they got home to Nazarethnot enough, must set out again. It is remarkable that these first years were spent in a heathen country. There till seven years old.  3. Now why? I will give you a reason. He would undergo every suffering; He would be in a heathen country to share the trials of His apostles and missioners. In Jerusalem was the Temple of God, in the Holy Land His religion; but even there He chose not the Temple, but Nazarethand the first years of His life Heliopolis, in heathen Egypt.  4. Now it must not be supposed that our Lord was too young to have a trial. (Explain.) Ignorance came from the fall. He was as sensitive [in childhood] as [we] when we are grown. Thus He saw all the evil of the place; and as His body made Him feel in the crucifixion, so His soul was exposed to moral sufferings from the first.  5. And the suffering was greater than we conceive. To live among heathens is a misery, the greater, the purer the mindLot in Sodom, St. Paul at Athensthe world is everywhere, and we can understand from a country which is not heathen, such as this, how evil it is, though it would be a great deal worse [among heathens].  6. Even in this country, I say, which is not heathen, the misery of being in the world is great to any holy mind. Take  e.g.   a city like this, and fancy the thoughts of an apostle in it. Could he go about it freely? A continual service of the devil here. How? By sins of the tongue; not like the seven Catholic Hours coming at intervals, but incessantly; a continual light talk in a thousand places, from morning to night, with scarce breaks. Who is honoured like the devil? Blasphemy and immodesty, so that most men's mouths and all men's ears are polluted from year to year's end. And are not their hearts too? Then imagination. Alas!  this  is why the devil loves the bad talk; it is the  pabulum , the  silva  of corruption; it sets the heart on fire, as shavings round the wood and coal for a fire. I don't know anything more awful. Other sins men commit from time to time, but this one now. The evil concupiscence boils over and burns without exhaustion, and involves every one, so that religious people are like the Three Children [in the fiery furnace].and how many, many fall!  7. Well this, bad as it is, is not so bad as Egypt, as heathen Heliopolis, for this country has been Catholicremains of good, which have soaked in. Grant that a modern city is a furnace of sinyet it [sin] was deified in Egypt. Vices canonised in animalsheathen idolatryall vices made godsthe world lieth in wickedness, etc. the god of this world, etc. .the prince of the power of this air, of the spirit that now worketh on the children of unbelief . O misery of the infant Jesus walking in the streets! St. Aloysius fainting at the mention of a mortal sinsmellsaints detecting mortal sin [by its smell]. As sick men cannot bear strong scent or sound, so purity here. What a living martyrdom, etc.  8. I have said He did this for our sakes, to taste every trial, to sanctify every state, to sanctify the state of those who live in the world.  9. You who live in the world, resist evil. On confraternitiesthird order of St. Francis, and so allude to the Oratorium Parvum. Your confessors may, or may not, from not liking to put burdens on you, speak of these. "  BTW, the "Oratorium Parvum" the Venerable alludes to is the "Little", or Secular, Oratory.

       From the homily  Fr. Michael was the  celebrant at noon Mass today. What I remember most from the homily was the observation that in today's Gospel, many people were cured, not by Jesus saying so, but by touching the tassel of His cloak- a fine example of the sacramental principle.

       St. Paul at Melita   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    "And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat."    "Secure in his prophetic strength,      The water peril o'er,  The many-gifted man at length      Stepp'd on the promised shore.   He trod the shore; but not to rest,      Nor wait till Angels came;  Lo! humblest pains the Saint attest,      The firebrands and the flame.   But, when he felt the viper's smart,      Then instant aid was given;  Christian! hence learn to do thy part,      And leave the rest to Heaven. "    Messina.

        There would have to be a  lot  of candles on that cake...   Today is Venerable John Henry Newman's 203rd birthday! It would be a most appropriate present to pray for his canonization today. Here is a form that could be used:   Eternal Father, You led JOHN HENRY NEWMAN to follow the kindly light of Truth, and he obediently responded to your heavenly calls at any cost. As writer, preacher, counsellor and educator, as pastor, Oratorian, and servant of the poor he laboured to build up Your Kingdom.  Grant that through your Vicar on Earth we may hear the words, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter into the company of the canonized saints."  May You manifest Your servant's power of intercession by even extraordinary answers to the prayers of the faithful throughout the world. We pray particularly for our intentions in his name and in the Name of Jesus Christ Your Son our Lord.  Amen.   Please report any favours received to: The Postulator, The Oratory, Hagley Road, Birmingham B16 8UE, England    A special thank you to any bloggers who have mentioned this anniversary- I have seen posts by  urlLink  Lane Core  and  urlLink Gerard Serafin , but the thank you extends to others I may have missed.  In 1858, the Venerable apparently spent part of his birthday giving some catechetical instructions on the Creed. The following notes are still extant:  "1. I said last that the Creed did not contain all that we had to believe, but certain portions, and this is put into our hands for various reasons.  2. First, as a badge of what our religion is: 'Christian is my name, Catholic my surname.' The sign of the crossso the Creed.  3. Next, as what is fundamentalwhich 'infants in grace know,' 'other foundation,' etc. 'No one can say Jesus is the Lord,' etc.  Disciplina arcani .  4. Thirdly, as being easy of memory, being only a few clauses, a few words in each.  5. Three chief partstwelve articles(go through them).  6. As to the twelve articles, there was a belief  that each apostle gave an articlethence called Apostles' Creed; but not so, but, as I said last time, because it contains apostolic doctrine.  7. And hence there were originally lesser variations in the Creed in various parts of the Church, in various countries. Rites and ceremonies vary, and though the faith never varies, the expression of it may. We have an instance of this in the  Creed of the Mass . (Exemplify.)  8. Each Church, then, had its own Creed, the same except in few words, or a few articles put in or out. The Creed which has remained and which we use as the Apostles' Creed is the Creed always used in Rome. Saying it at the Confessional of St. Peter.  9. Another thing to be said about the Apostles' Creed: the Nicene has additions because of heresies-  Consubstantial , etc.; the Apostles' Creed that of the Church of Rome, where heresy never was.  10. But lest the Creed should grow too large, the Council of Ephesus determined that it should not be added to, though heresies arose; hence Theotokos not introduced. "

       On February 20, 1876...  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  "  Christ our Fellow-Sufferer  1. INTROD.We have to labour and suffer, as I said last week, but we have this support and consolation, that Christ labours and suffers with us. This a great subject.  2. Adam fell. God never puts on us more than we can do; He gives grace sufficient.  3. But it is much more than this. He might have forgiven and restored us  without  Christ's death; but He has done so in a more excellent way.  4. The Prince of Wales going into a labour prison, putting on dress of convicts, having his hair cut, all for the sake of converting convicts. So  5. Christ has sought usbut more, for He has wrought and suffered for and instead of us.  6. Still more; not only He has taken  ours , but has given us Histhe vine and branchesone body, He the head, Rom. xii. [5] ; 'Why persecutest thou me?' [Acts ix. 4].  7. We are all [that] He issons of Godfull of graceheirs of heaven.  8. Is not this sufficient to sweeten labour? "

       The February  First Things     is now  urlLink online.  I found this article from the "While We're At It" section particularly interesting.  'What on earth do those people think theyre doing?' That has been the response of innumerable people watching the Episcopal Church, and perhaps the Anglican communion, on its course of self-destructing. In these pages, Philip Turner, a distinguished Anglican priest, missionary, and theology professor, writing in sorrow laced with anger, gave one answer to the above question (see FT, November 2003). It is easy to dismiss people with whom we strongly disagree as being either ignorant or crazy, or both. But we owe them and ourselves the effort of trying to understand what they think they are doing, and why. Leander Harding, rector of St. Johns Church in Stamford, Connecticut, makes that effort, employing a 1992 book by the noted literary critic, Harold Bloom. In  The American Religion , Bloom contended that religious Americawhether it is Southern Baptist, Methodist, or even Mormonis, at its heart, Gnostic. 'We are,' Bloom wrote, 'a religiously mad culture, furiously searching for the spirit, but each of us is subject and object of the one question, which must be for the original self, a spark or breath in us that we are convinced goes back to before the creation.' I will let Harding take it from there: 'The quintessential American Religion is the quest for the true and original self which is the "pearl of great price," the ultimate value. Finding the true self requires absolute and complete freedom of choice unconstrained by any sources of authority outside the self. Limits upon personal freedom and choice are an affront to all that is sacred to the American Religion. When the self-determining self finds "the real me" salvation is achieved and the ultimate self has achieved contact with the ultimate reality. Finding your true self is to the contemporary Gnostic the same thing as finding God. For the Gnostic the purpose of the religious community is to facilitate the quest and validate the results. The contemporary Gnostic church, which can appear in both conservative and liberal forms, is the community of those who know that they have found God because they have found their own uncreated depths. Both devotees of the New Age and many in some "conservative" Christian circles see salvation as purely a matter of personal experience, which can only be validated by those who have had similar "deeply personal" experiences. Notice how perfectly the contemporary presentation of homosexuality fits the American Religion. A person who discovers that he or she is gay has recovered his or her true self and "come out" and come through what the Gnostics called the "aeons," in this case levels of personal, familial, and social oppression that hinder and constrain the true self. It is a heroic and perilous journey of self-discovery which would be familiar to a first-century Gnostic like Valentinus. That the means of liberation is sexual practice is even a familiar theme. Some ancient Gnostics were ascetic but others counseled sexual license. Both stratagems can come from the same contempt of nature and are different ways of asserting the radical independence of the self. Here is the point. Gene Robinson was elected Bishop of the Episcopal Church in New Hampshire not in spite of being gay, not as an act of toleration and compassion toward gay people, but because he is gay and as such is an icon of the successful completion of the quest to find the true and original self. He has been chosen for high religious office because he represents high religious attainment. He is being recognized and receiving regard for being an accomplished practitioner of the American Religion. According to this Gnostic logic, divorcing his wife and leaving his family to embrace the gay lifestyle is not some unfortunate concession to irresistible sexual urges but an example of the pain and sacrifice that the seeker of the true self must be willing to endure. That natural, organic, and conventional restraints must be set aside is time-worn Gnostic nostrum. From the point of view of this contemporary Gnosticism, if the Church does not validate such a noble quest for enlightenment then it invalidates itself and shows that it is no help in the only spiritual struggle that counts, the struggle to be the "real me." Because Gene Robinson has "found himself" he has according to the Gnostic logic of the American Religion found God and is naturally thought to be a truly spiritual person and a fit person to inspire and lead others on their spiritual journey which is to end in a discovery of the true self which is just so the discovery of the only real god, the Gnostic god. Seeing the elevation of Gene Robinson through the lens of the mythos of the American Religion explains some of the fanaticism of his defenders, explains why so many bishops of the Episcopal Church including the Presiding Bishop would be willing to take such institutional risks. Here is a paradigm of salvation that echoes deeply in the American soul and promises to restore a sense of purpose to a mainline church which has lost confidence in the story of salvation told by the orthodox tradition of the Church. Inclusion becomes the fundamental value for the Church because it allows the Church to have a real purpose of validating that people have indeed found their true identity, and thus found God. Gay people become icons of hope. To celebrate gays in the life of the Church, not accept but affirm and celebrate, is to celebrate the Church as a truly spiritual community with real spiritual power which can facilitate and validate the salvation of souls. The church leaders who are risking everything for Gene Robinson are in their own way and according to an heretical but powerful vision trying desperately to find a spiritual vocation for the Church that has some liveliness and connects deeply with the deepest yearning of the American soul. The Presiding Bishop and his company of supporters think they are regaining the lost keys of heaven. That these newly discovered keys are not the real thing but Gnostic imitators of the keys of St. Peter will be lost on those who are drunk on the promises of the American Religion of the true, free, and uncreated self.'

       For Thursday  "When strangers are so unfavourably impressed with us, because they see Images of our Lady in our churches, and crowds flocking about her, they forget that there is a Presence within the sacred walls, infinitely more awful, which claims and obtains from us a worship transcendently different from any devotion we pay to her. That devotion to her might indeed tend to idolatry, if it were encouraged in Protestant churches, where there is nothing higher than it to attract the worshipper: but all the images that a Catholic church ever contained, all the Crucifixes at its Altars brought together, do not so affect its frequenters, as the lamp which betokens the presence or absence there of the Blessed Sacrament. Is not this so certain, so notorious, that on some occasions it has been even brought as a charge against us, that we are irreverent in church, when what seemed to the objector to be irreverence was but the necessary change of feeling, which came over those who were in it, on their knowing that their Lord was no longer there, but away? " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  A Letter Addressed to the Rev. E. B. Pusey, D.D.,on Occasion of His Eirenicon

        From  Lectures on the Present Position of Catholics in England     by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "As troubles and trials circle round you, He will give you what you want at present-'a mouth, and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist and gainsay.' 'There is a time for silence, and a time to speak;' the time for speaking is come. What I desiderate in Catholics is the gift of bringing out what their religion is; it is one of those 'better gifts,' of which the Apostle bids you be 'zealous.' You must not hide your talent in a napkin, or your light under a bushel. I want a laity, not arrogant, not rash in speech, not disputatious, but men who know their religion, who enter into it, who know just where they stand, who know what they hold, and what they do not, who know their creed so well, that they can give an account of it, who know so much of history that they can defend it. I want an intelligent, well-instructed laity; I am not denying you are such already: but I mean to be severe, and, as some would say, exorbitant in my demands, I wish you to enlarge your knowledge, to cultivate your reason, to get an insight into the relation of truth to truth, to learn to view things as they are, to understand how faith and reason stand to each other, what are the bases and principles of Catholicism, and where lie the main inconsistences and absurdities of the Protestant theory. I have no apprehension you will be the worse Catholics for familiarity with these subjects, provided you cherish a vivid sense of God above, and keep in mind that you have souls to be judged and to be saved. In all times the laity have been the measure of the Catholic spirit..."

       I'm wondering if anybody else...  has read the book  Turmoil and Truth: the Historical Roots of the Modern Crisis in the Catholic Church , by Philip Trower ? I'm more than halfway through, and it is quite good. Here's a quote... "Part of the mystery of the Church is that, in arranging how His truth is to be handed on, God made Greek philosophers, or anyone resembling them, subordinate to Galilean fishermen. The three wise men kneeling before Dvine Wisdom made visible as a baby provides a prototype. A Pope or a bishop may be personally learned, but his learning does not add anything to his authority as pope or bishop. His authority to pass judgement on the ideas of even the most brilliant thinker, where those ideas touch faith or morals, comes solely form the fact that he is a sucessor of one of Our Lord's little-educated working-class apostles. St. Paul the brilliant 'university type', was brought in later, but only after a big dose of humiliation. For Catholics, the purpose behind this plan is not difficult to see. Everything in God's designs is directed to keeping us small in our own esteem, since this is the only way into the kingdom of Heaven, and no one needs more help in this matter than clever men and women. (Over the entrance to every Catholic university could well be carved St. Therese of Lisieux's words: "God has no need of any human instrument, least of all me.")  But this ultimate subordination of 'philosophers' to 'fishermen' is not something the clever find naturally easy to accept. With a strong sense of the supernatural they will. But if faith starts to decline it starts to stick in the throat. Then, instead of seeing themselves as servants of Christ and his Church, they become, without realizing it, servants of worldly powers- like William of Ockham in the 14th century when he fled from Avignon to the copurt of Louis of Bavaria- of the spirit of the times, or of their own opinions and ambitions. One of the most revealing things about some of the theologians who have come to fame since the Council is their apparent indifference to the confusion into which they have plunged the simple and lowly. As long as they can write what they please, they do not seem to care what the consequences are. If doctors had acted like this, leaving behind a trail of corpses and invalids, they would have earned not reputations but infamy."

       In February of 1956...  The Professor wrote a letter to a Mr. Michael Straight in which he discussed Frodo's motives and actions, in view of the petitions in the Lord's Prayer.  (WARNING! LORD OF THE RINGS SPOILERS!)    " 'Lead us not into temptation etc.' is the harder and the less often considered petition. The view,  in the terms of my story, is that though every event or situation has at least two aspects: the history and development of the individual ( it is something out of which he can get good, ultimate good, for himself, or fail to do so), and the history of the world (which depends on his action for its own sake)- still there are abnormal situations in which one may be placed. 'Sacrificial situations', I should call them; such positions in which the 'good' of the world depends on the behavior of an individual in circumstances which demand of him suffering and endurance far beyond the normal- even, it may happen (or seem, humanly speaking), demand a strength of body and mind which he does not possess; he is in a sense doomed to failure, doomed to fall into temptation or be broken by pressure against his will; that is any choice he could make or would make unfettered, not under duress. Frodo was in such a position; an apparently complete trap: a person of greater power could probably never have resisted the Ring's lure to power for so long: a person of less power could not hope to resist it in the final decision. (Already Frodo had been unwilling to harm the Ring before he set out, and was incapable of surrendering it to Sam. )  The Quest was bound to fail as a piece of world-plan, and also was bound to end in disaster as the story of humble Frodo's development to the 'noble'; his sanctification. Fail it would and did as far as Frodo considered alone was concerned. He 'apostasized'- and I have had one savage letter, crying out that he should have been executed as a traitor, not honoured. Believe me, it was not until I read this that I had myself any idea how 'topical' such a situation might appear. It arose naturally from my 'plot' conceived in main outline in 1936. I did not foresee that before the tale was published we should enter a dark age in which the technique of torture and disruption of personality would rival that of Mordor and the Ring and present us with the practical problem of honest men of good will broken down into apostates and traitors. But at this point the 'salvation' of the world and Frodo's own 'salvation' is achieved by his previous  pity  and forgiveness of injury. At any point any practical person would have told Frodo that Gollum would certainly betray him, and could rob him in the end. (Not quite 'certainly'. The clumsiness in fidelity of Sam was what finally pushed Gollum over the brink, when about to repent) To 'pity' him, to forbear to kill him, was a piece of folly, or a mystical belief in the ultimate value-in-itself of pity and generosity even if disastrous in the world of time. He did rob and injure him in the end- by by a 'grace', that last betrayal was at a precise juncture when the final evil deed was the most beneficial thing anyone could have done for Frodo! By a situation created by his 'forgiveness', he was saved himself and relieved of his burden. He was verey justly accorded the highest honours- since it is clear that he and Sam never concealed the precise course of events."

The cynic in me suspects that that translates to "filling the spot with a part-timer or two so that no benefits are involved" but I don't have any proof... ) Prayers for me in my continuing search for gainful employment would be a great blessing.

       For Friday   Short Meditations on the Stations of the Cross  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Begin with an Act of Contrition  First Station Jesus condemned to Death   V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  The Holy, Just, and True was judged by sinners, and put to death. Yet, while they judged, they were compelled to acquit Him. Judas, who betrayed Him, said, 'I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.' Pilate, who sentenced Him, said, 'I am innocent of the blood of this just person,' and threw the guilt upon the Jews. The Centurion who saw Him crucified said, 'Indeed this was a just man.'  Thus ever, O Lord, Thou art justified in Thy words, and dost overcome when Thou art judged. And so, much more, at the last day 'They shall look on Him whom they pierced'; and He who was condemned in weakness shall judge the world in power, and even those who are condemned will confess their judgment is just.  Pater, Ave, &c.  V. Miserere nostri, Domine. R. Miserere nostri. Fidelium animæ, &c.    The Second Station Jesus receives His Cross   V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  Jesus supports the whole world by His divine power, for He is God; but the weight was less heavy than was the Cross which our sins hewed out for Him. Our sins cost Him this humiliation. He had to take on Him our nature, and to appear among us as a man, and to offer up for us a great sacrifice. He had to pass a life in penance, and to endure His passion and death at the end of it. O Lord God Almighty, who dost bear the weight of the whole world without weariness, who bore the weight of all our sins, though they wearied Thee, as Thou art the Preserver of our bodies by Thy Providence, so be Thou the Saviour of our souls by Thy precious blood.  Pater, Ave, &c. "

       On February 26th, 1846..  Venerable John Henry Newman, who had been received into the Church in October of the previous year, wrote a letter to his friend Henry Wilberforce, which included the following:  "I am writing next room to the Chapel. It is such an incomprehensible blessing to have Christ's bodily presence in one's house, within one's walls, as swallows up all other privileges and destroys, or should destroy, every pain. To know that He is close by-to be able again and again through the day to go in to Him; and be sure, my dearest W., when I am thus in His Presence you are not forgotten. It is the place for intercession surely, where the Blessed Sacrament is...."

Here is a litany written by the Venerable, which may be useful:    Litany of Penance  Lord, have mercy.  Lord, have mercy.  Christ, have mercy.  Christ, have mercy.  Lord, have mercy.  Lord, have mercy.  Christ, hear us.  Christ, graciously hear us.   God the Father of Heaven,                   Have mercy on us.   God the Son, Redeemer of the world,               " God the Holy Ghost, Holy Trinity, one God, Incarnate Lord, Lover of souls, Saviour of sinners,  Who didst come to seek those that were lost, Who didst fast for them forty days and nights, By Thy tenderness towards Adam when he fell, By Thy faithfulness to Noe in the ark, By Thy remembrance of Lot in the midst of sinners, By Thy mercy on the Israelites in the desert, By Thy forgiveness of David after his confession, By Thy patience with wicked Achab on his humiliation, By Thy restoration of the penitent Manasses, By Thy long suffering towards the Ninevites,     when they went in sackcloth and ashes, By Thy blessing on the Maccabees,     who fasted before the battle, By Thy choice of John to go before Thee as the preacher of penance, By Thy testimony to the Publican,     who hung his head and smote his breast, By Thy welcome given to the returning Prodigal, By Thy gentleness with the woman of Samaria, By Thy condescension towards Zacchæus,     persuading him to restitution, By Thy pity upon the woman taken in adultery, By Thy love of Magdalen, who loved much, By Thy converting look, at which Peter wept, By Thy gracious words to the thief upon the cross,  We sinners,                                   Beseech Thee, hear us.

       On February 24th, 1850   Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  " On Grace, the Principle of Eternal Life  1. INTROD.God, who had been the sole life from eternity, is the life of all things. He did not lose His prerogative or give to others or creation what He is Himself.  2. Nothing lives without Him; nothing is. Animated nature, vegetables, nay, the very material substances, have their life, if it may be so called, their motion and activity in Himthe elements. What is called Nature, a principle of life, is from Him.  3. Moreover, the life He has given to Nature is but transient and fleeting. It is beautiful while it lasts, but it comes to an end. Nay, it is self-destructive; thus the water and the fire, which are the conservation, have been and shall be the destruction of the earth. And so growth tends to decay. It is the same process; all things grow to an end.  4. Thus this earth, as I have said, will be consumed. Thus the year, too, comes to an endhow beautiful spring, yet it doesn't last. The year runs a reckless course, like a spendthrift; it cannot help going on till it is nothing. So it is with bodily health'dust thou art,' etc. We see it again in animals, which are sportive and playful when young, but get old and miserable and sullen. Thus in Nature the best is first.  5. Nature, then, has no immortal principle in it. All natural things run a course; and this is true of the soul, of the natural soul. The soul as it is by Nature, by original creation, has no principle of permanent life in it. The soul grows old as anything else.  6. Describe the engaging manners of the youngfascinating, light-heartedness, cheerfulness; affections warm; imagination, conversation, wit; all pain shaken offwhat can be better? Why is not Nature enough? Wait awhile.  7. Wait awhile, for the soul grows old as anything elseas the leaves turn yellow, as the animal frame grows stiff, so wait on a few years, the natural soul too grows old; the beauty decays as beauty of person; the soul contracts, stiffens, hardens, instead of being supple and versatile, and elastic and vigorous; its limbs are cramped; everything is a burden; it is a fear to it to be pulled out into new positions; it cannot take pleasure in what once pleasednot in poetry or works of fiction, not in friendship; it cannot form new friends; it is bereaved [of the old ones], and does not replace them; it cannot laugh; disappointment breaks it; it cannot recover. Hence relapsing into natural imperfections (as crabbedness, ill-nature, etc.) which a man had seemed to overcome, having ever struggled against them.  8. Oh terrible! old people hard-hearted, without affections, careless of the loss of friendsnot from high motivesthey have no faithvirtue seems a fancywith hearts like stone, etc.  9. Follow such a one into the next world. What is to be his happiness for eternity?immortal, yet dead, eternal death. Life of the soul is in the affections; he has no affectionsa closed heart. The devil cannot love God vide  St. Catherine of Genoa in  St. Alfonso's Sermons , p. 335.  10. Such is the course of Nature in the soul as in the body. Nature ages; it has in it no principle of life. No, grace is the only principle of immortality. We must go beyond nature; we must go to something higher. Here, then, is one characteristic difference between Nature and Grace.  11. EXHORTATION, Eccles. xii. All saints have lived by lovethe martyrs, confessors, etc., etc. St. Valentine  who connects us with the first age, shows that the Church has kept, not lost, her first bloom.

"Deeply do I feel, ever will I protest, for I can appeal to the ample testimony of history to bear me out, that, in questions of right and wrong, there is nothing really strong in the whole world, nothing decisive and operative, but the voice of him, to whom have been committed the keys of the kingdom and the oversight of Christ's flock. The voice of Peter is now, as it ever has been, a real authority, infallible when it teaches, prosperous when it commands, ever taking the lead wisely and distinctly in its own province, adding certainty to what is probable, and persuasion to what is certain. Before it speaks, the most saintly may mistake; and after it has spoken, the most gifted must obey." - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.

       On March 6, 1848  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., wrote the following meditation:  Hope in GodCreator   "1. God has created all things for good; all things for their greatest good; everything for its own good. What is the good of one is not the good of another; what makes one man happy would make another unhappy. God has determined, unless I interfere with His plan, that I should reach that which will be my greatest happiness. He looks on me individually, He calls me by my name, He knows what I can do, what I can best be, what is my greatest happiness, and He means to give it me.  2. God knows what is my greatest happiness, but I do not. There is no rule about what is happy and good; what suits one would not suit another. And the ways by which perfection is reached vary very much; the medicines necessary for our souls are very different from each other. Thus God leads us by strange ways; we know He wills our happiness, but we neither know what our happiness is, nor the way. We are blind; left to ourselves we should take the wrong way; we must leave it to Him.  3. Let us put ourselves into His hands, and not be startled though He leads us by a strange way,  a mirabilis via , as the Church speaks. Let us be sure He will lead us right, that He will bring us to that which is, not indeed what we think best, nor what is best for another, but what is best for us.   Colloquy.  O, my God, I will put myself without reserve into Thy hands. Wealth or woe, joy or sorrow, friends or bereavement, honour or humiliation, good report or ill report, comfort or discomfort, Thy presence or the hiding of Thy countenance, all is good if it comes from Thee. Thou art wisdom and Thou art lovewhat can I desire more? Thou hast led me in Thy counsel, and with glory hast Thou received me. What have I in heaven, and apart from Thee what want I upon earth? My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the God of my heart, and my portion for ever. "

       For Friday    Short Meditations on the Stations of the Cross  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   The Third Station Jesus falls under the weight of the Cross the first time   "V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  Satan fell from heaven in the beginning; by the just sentence of his Creator he fell, against whom he had rebelled. And when he had succeeded in gaining man to join him in his rebellion, and his Maker came to save him, then his brief hour of triumph came, and he made the most of it. When the Holiest had taken flesh, and was in his power, then in his revenge and malice he determined, as he himself had been struck down by the Almighty arm, to strike in turn a heavy blow at Him who struck him. Therefore it was that Jesus fell down so suddenly. O dear Lord, by this Thy first fall raise us all out of sin, who have so miserably fallen under its power.  Pater, Ave, &c.    The Fourth Station Jesus meets His Mother   V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  There is no part of the history of Jesus but Mary has her part in it. There are those who profess to be His servants, who think that her work was ended when she bore Him, and after that she had nothing to do but disappear and be forgotten. But we, O Lord, Thy children of the Catholic Church, do not so think of Thy Mother. She brought the tender infant into the Temple, she lifted Him up in her arms when the wise men came to adore Him. She fled with Him to Egypt, she took Him up to Jerusalem when He was twelve years old. He lived with her at Nazareth for thirty years. She was with Him at the marriage-feast. Even when He had left her to preach, she hovered about Him. And now she shows herself as He toils along the Sacred Way with His cross on His shoulders. Sweet Mother, let us ever think of thee when we think of Jesus, and when we pray to Him, ever aid us by thy powerful intercession.  Pater, Ave, &c. "

       David Morrison  has two links to interesting articles on his blog,  urlLink Sed   urlLink Contra :  urlLink The End of Marriage in Scandinavia  - I don't entirely agree with some of the conclusion (the part where he says that there are 'stopping places' on the continual slide down where further instablility can be halted seems forced)- but the statistics alone would make this a jaw-dropper...  urlLink An Atheist Argues Against Abortion  - I (obviously!) think this author is wrong on the biggest question of all- but at least he has enough sense to see that a baby is a baby, whether 'wanted' or not.     This second article reminded me of someone I knew back in my college days. The treasurer of our university pro-life group was an atheist. ( He often said all atheists should be fervently pro-life, since they believe this life is the only one we've got !)  At a pro-life rally, he was confronted by some pro-death folks, and there ensued one rather odd conversation:  "You anti-choice people are all intolerant bigots, trying to force your religion down our throats." "I'm an atheist." (Stunned pause, then...) "No, you're not !"

       For Thursday  "I need hardly observe to you, my Brothers, that the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament is one of the simplest rites of the Church. The priests enter and kneel down; one of them unlocks the Tabernacle, takes out the Blessed Sacrament, inserts it upright in a Monstrance of precious metal, and sets it in a conspicuous place above the altar, in the midst of lights, for all to see. The people then begin to sing; meanwhile the Priest twice offers incense to the King of heaven, before whom he is kneeling. Then he takes the Monstrance in his hands, and turning to the people, blesses them with the Most Holy, in the form of a cross, while the bell is sounded by one of the attendants to call attention to the ceremony. It is our Lord's solemn benediction of His people, as when He lifted up His hands over the children, or when He blessed His chosen ones when He ascended up from Mount Olivet. As sons might come before a parent before going to bed at night, so, once or twice a week the great Catholic family comes before the Eternal Father, after the bustle or toil of the day, and He smiles upon them, and sheds upon them the light of His countenance. It is a full accomplishment of what the Priest invoked upon the Israelites, 'The Lord bless thee and keep thee; the Lord show His face to thee and have mercy on thee; the Lord turn His countenance to thee and give thee peace.' Can there be a more touching rite, even in the judgment of those who do not believe in it? How many a man, not a Catholic, is moved, on seeing it, to say 'Oh, that I did but believe it!' when he sees the Priest take up the Fount of Mercy, and the people bent low in adoration!

       Two prayer requests....  The first is a grim one. Some time ago, I mentioned that a friend had requested prayers for a woman he knew who was unexpectedly pregnant and tempted to abort her child. Yesterday, he sorrowfully informed me that she had made the wrong decision. Prayers for this woman, that she will come to repentance and  acceptance of Christ's healing love, would be a blessing in this tragic situation. The second is joyful- though I'll admit it is tinged with envy on my part. Tommorow, Fr. David, Fr. Joseph, and a group of students will be heading out on the Spring Break pilgrimage to Rome . Prayers for their safe travel and spiritual benefit would be welcome.

       On March 3, 1861  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  State of Original Sin   "1. INTROD.-State of original sin. Deprivation of grace; consequences, the 'wounds.'  2. Stripped of God's supernatural gifts or grace. He might never have given it, and then no punishment. But since we were intended for heaven, it was a great punishment. Take the case of a person born to wealth, etc., of cultivated mind, etc., banished to a desert island.  3. And as a spendthrift involves all his descendants, so here.  4. But worse. I described last week the triple subjection. Well, when man cast off God, his passions and affections rebelled against his reason, and his body against his soul. Case of a strong man or child on horseback. Daniel in the lions' den.  5. This great calamity constitutes the wounds of human nature-parable of the Good Samaritan- first  stripped,  then  wounded.  6. Now here I shall view them as three-the absence of three subjections-sloth, selfishness, sensuality.  7. Describe sloth-that deadness, blindness of soul, dislike of prayer, disgust at religion, liking to ridicule it. Dislike of ruling our mind and heart, etc., etc.  8. Therefore selfishness-making self the centre, etc.  9. And therefore sensuality-idolising the creature.  10. And then these may be considered sins against God, our neighbour and ourselves. Contrasts-love of God, love of our neighbour, and self-command.  11. They branch into the seven deadly sins: (1) sloth; (2) pride, avarice, anger, envy; (3) gluttony and luxury.  12. They tend to utter death. Are you to live after this life? What is your state then, and is God in heaven? Again I say, what is your state then, with the world swept away?  13. What is your duty? As a ruined man might try to repair his fortunes. Children of this world labouring to regain an ancestral estate.  14. Two great graces: illumination and excitation.  15. 'Now is the acceptable time.' "

This means to contemplate, to recognise, to fear, to love. Now let us see the necessity of this.  3. Here we are tempted to make the world our God, because we see it, and do not see God.  4. But consider what our state is when we are dead; our senses then are all gone.  5. Consider this: we have five senses, and we know what a deprivation the loss of any one-sight or hearing or touch or feeling-any one.  6. But in death they all go together. See what we are reduced to. It is true we cannot have any bodily pain-and that is what people are apt to say, 'All his pain is over.'  7. True, but is there no pain of the mind? Do we know how acute pain of the mind is?-surely we know it even in this life.  8. Let us consider our being suddenly cut off from all intercourse except with ourselves-a truly solitary confinement; worse, for that here is only loss of hearing,  i.e.   conversation.  9. Supposing in addition it comes on us that we should not be thus, except for our own fault!  10. Now it is clear that we should have no remedy unless God visited us and gave us light.  11. The light of glory, the light of heaven, the only thing.  12. But suppose we have no desire for it, no love of it. Suppose we look back in fond  regret   to this world.  13. Therefore the love of God is the  only  way in which we can be happy."  Also, Gerard Serafin posted a quote from the Venerable on  urlLink Lent.

       Aarrgh !  I usually don't mind the ads that appear at the top of my blog, but one keeps showing up that really bugs me. Apparently it is a link to someone selling books by the Professor. Hint to whoever is responsible for this link: misspelling the name of the author whose books one is selling is not a smooth move. It's TOLKIEN, TOLKIEN, TOLKIEN. Advertising "Books by Tolkein" makes you look clueless.  (End of rant)

       On March 1st, 1855  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., wrote one of my favorite prayers...   A Short Visit to the Blessed Sacrament before Meditation   "In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.  I place myself in the presence of Him, in whose Incarnate Presence I am before I place myself there.  I adore Thee, O my Saviour, present here as God and man, in soul and body, in true flesh and blood.  I acknowledge and confess that I kneel before that Sacred Humanity, which was conceived in Mary's womb, and lay in Mary's bosom; which grew up to man's estate, and by the Sea of Galilee called the Twelve, wrought miracles, and spoke words of wisdom and peace; which in due season hung on the cross, lay in the tomb, rose from the dead, and now reigns in heaven.  I praise, and bless, and give myself wholly to Him, who is the true Bread of my soul, and my everlasting joy. "

       My thoughts on  The Passion of the Christ     These thoughts are not completely organized- but they'll do for now...  (WARNING! SPOILERS! )      While I could carp about a few things, I was overwhelmingly moved by this film.  What kept running through my head, over and over, was "Precious Lord, what did we do to You ? What did  I  do to You ? "  The moment which was the most intensely gut-wrenching for me was on the  Via Dolorosa , when Our Lady sees Christ fall- and there is a flashback to Our Lord as a little Boy, tripping over His own feet as children do, and His mother rushing to comfort Him. She picks Him up in her arms, with the words, "I'm here."  Then we come back to Our Lord, beaten and bleeding, nearly dead with exhaustion- and Our Lady rushes to Him again, with the same words, "I'm here." We- all of us- tortured and killed her Son.    While many people have commented on the horrific brutality of the scourging, I couldn't help but think of the traditional connection often made (in books for use in praying the Rosary, for example) between Our Lord's scourging and the world's 'sins of the flesh'. I thought it appropriate for so much focus to be on the vicious toll our indulgence of our bodies took on Our Lord's Body, especially in our society where anything goes 'as long as nobody gets hurt.' Well, Somebody already was hurt- and, innocent and pure, gave His life for us.   I found the treatment of Pilate and his wife interesting. While Claudia is firm in her convictions and stands for truth, her husband is a relativist.  As he pretty much states, the consequences for himself are the only "truth" he cares about. This is, again, a type of sin which is frighteningly prevalent today- and needs to be confronted whenever possible.   This movie was difficult to watch- but I need to see it again....

       From  Parochial and Plain Sermons     by Venerable John Henry Newman , C.O. "Let it not then distress Christians, even if they find themselves exposed to thoughts from which they turn with abhorrence and terror. Rather let such a trial bring before their thoughts, with something of vividness and distinctness, the condescension of the Son of God. For if it be a trial to us creatures and sinners to have thoughts alien from our hearts presented to us, what must have been the suffering to the Eternal Word, God of God, and Light of Light, Holy and True, to have been so subjected to Satan, that he could inflict every misery on Him short of sinning? Certainly it is a trial to us to have motives and feelings imputed to us before men, by the accuser of the brethren, which we never entertained; it is a trial to have ideas secretly suggested within, from which we shrink; it is a trial to us for Satan to be allowed so to mix his own thoughts with ours, that we feel guilty even when we are not; nay, to be able to set on fire our irrational nature, till in some sense we really sin against our will: but has not One gone before us more awful in His trial, more glorious in His victory? He was tempted in all points 'like as we are, yet without sin.' Surely here too, Christ's temptation speaks comfort and encouragement to us."

"Ah, holy Jesus, how hast Thou offended, That man to judge Thee hath in hate pretended? By foes derided, by Thine own rejected, O most afflicted.  Who was the guilty? Who brought this upon Thee? Alas, my treason, Jesus, hath undone Thee. Twas I, Lord, Jesus, I it was denied Thee. I crucified Thee!  Lo, the Good Shepherd for the sheep is offered; The slave hath sinned, and the Son hath suffered; For mans atonement, while he nothing heedeth, God intercedeth.  For me, kind Jesus, was Thy incarnation, Thy mortal sorrow, and Thy lifes oblation; Thy death of anguish and Thy bitter passion, For my salvation.  Therefore, kind Jesus, since I cannot pay Thee, I do adore Thee, and will ever pray Thee, Think on Thy pity and Thy love unswerving, Not my deserving. "  BTW, the choir will not be singing at Mass for the next two Sundays, as our director will be in Rome ....

Thomas, who said, 'Let us all die with Him,' has forsaken Thee.  Not one of these is with Thee, but Thou art led forth alone, Thou who didst preserve me immaculate, my Son and my God. They who promised to go with Thee into prison and to die with Thee have forsaken Thee and have fled.  Not one of these is with Thee, but Thou art led forth alone, Thou who didst preserve me immaculate, my Son and my God. "   The Ambrosian Liturgy

       On March 13th, 1845  Venerable Newman's sister Jemima wrote him the following anguished letter, as he was struggling through the last stages of his conversion. "You imagine rightly in thinking the communication at the end of your letter would give me a great deal of pain.(ed. The letter to which she was replying has not survived, but it is thought that at the end of it Venerable Newman confided to his sister his intention of resigning his Oriel Fellowship that October in preparation for his reception into the Catholic Church) I can think of nothing else since, and yet seem to be without the power of writing to you. Yet I can hardly say why it is so, for I am far from taken by surprise; indeed, I have been dreading to hear something of this sort for some time past. You have sufficiently warned me of it. Yet I have so much sanguineness in my composition that I always hope the worst misfortunes may be averted till they are irremediable. And what can be worse than this? It is like hearing that some dear friend must die. I cannot shut my eyes to this overpowering event that threatens any longer. What the consequences may be I know not. O dear John, can you have thought long enough before deciding on a step which, with its probable effects, must plunge so many into confusion and dismay? I know what you will answer?that nothing but the risk of personal salvation would lead you to it; and I quite believe it. I know you have all along had the greatest regard for others, and acted upon it for some time past. But think what must be our feelings who cannot entertain your views, but can only deplore it as a grievous mistake! And I feel bitterly how many good sort of people would not do you justice, but judge you very hardly indeed. It is a real pain and grief to think of you as severed from us, as it were, by your own sentence. I am much afraid, dear John, you may be taken by surprise by what I say, and expect I shall receive this event more easily. Indeed I cannot; it is to me the great proof of the badness of this world and the unfortunate times we live in that such a one as you should take the line you have taken ... Pray excuse the incoherence of this letter. I am afraid it is very strange, and does not express one small portion of my feelings. Our poor distracted Church seems to me in pieces, and there is no one to help her, and her children's sympathies seem all drawn off another way. And how sad it is to me that I cannot say these things to you without your thinking me in error and in the wrong way, and not to have found the true way! Is there not enough in the world to make one weary of it, to all who try to see things as they really are? I am so afraid I have said wrong things, as well as not said what I intended; but I am really writing in great trouble and discomfort. Pray forgive me if I have not been as considerate as I ought to be, and wish earnestly to be, for I know your trial must be great indeed. Believe me, ever yours very affectionately, JEMIMA C. MOZLEY. " The Venerable wrote in reply: "I have just received your very painful letter, and wish I saw any way of making things easier to you or to myself.  If I went by what I wished, I should complete my seven years of waiting. Surely more than this, or as much, cannot be expected of me? cannot be right in me to give at my age. How life is going! I see men dying who were boys, almost children, when I was born. Pass a very few years, and I am an old man. What means of judging can I have more than I have? What maturity of mind am I to expect? If I am right to move at all, surely it is high time not to delay about it longer. Let me give my strength to the work, not my weakness-years in which I can profit the cause which calls me, not the dregs of life. Is it not like a death-bed repentance to put off what one feels one ought to do?  As to my convictions, I can but say what I have told you already, that I cannot at all make out why I should determine on moving, except as thinking I should offend God by not doing so. I cannot make out what I am at except on this supposition. At my time of life men love ease. I love ease myself. I am giving up a maintenance involving no duties, and adequate to all my wants. What in the world am I doing this for (I ask  myself  this), except that I think I am called to do so? I am making a large income by my sermons, I am, to say the very least, risking this; the chance is that my sermons will have no further sale at all. I have a good name with many; I am deliberately sacrificing it. I have a bad name with more. I am fulfilling all their worst wishes, and giving them their most coveted triumph. I am distressing all I love, unsettling all I have instructed or aided. I am going to those whom I do not know, and of whom I expect very little. I am making myself an outcast, and that at my age. Oh, what can it be but a stern necessity which causes this?  Pity me, my dear Jemima. What have I done thus to be deserted, thus to be left to take a wrong course, if it is wrong? I began by defending my own Church with all my might when others would not defend her. I went through obloquy in defending her. I in a fair measure succeed. At the very time of this success, before any reverse, in the course of my reading it breaks upon me that I am in a schismatical Church. I oppose myself to the notion; I write against it-year after year I write against it, and I do my utmost to keep others in the Church. From the time my doubts come upon me I begin to live more strictly; and really from that time to this I have done more towards my inward improvement, as far as I can judge, than in any time of my life. Of course I have all through had many imperfections, and might have done every single thing I have done much better than I have done it. Make all deductions on this score, still, after all, may I not humbly trust that I have not so acted as to forfeit God's gracious guidance? And how is it that I have improved in other points if in respect of this momentous matter I am so fearfully blinded ?  Why should I distress your kind heart with all my miseries? Yet you must know them, to avoid the greater misery of looking at me externally, and wondering and grieving over what seems incomprehensible. Shall I add that, distressing as is my state, it has not once come upon me to say, O that I had never begun to read theology! O that I had never meddled in ecclesiastical matters! O that I had never written the Tracts, &c.! I lay no stress on this, but state it ... Of course the human heart is mysterious. I may have some deep evil in me which I cannot fathom; I may have done some irreparable thing which demands punishment; but may not one humbly trust that the earnest prayers of many good people will be heard for me? May not one resign oneself to the event, whatever it turns out to be? May one not hope and believe, though one does not see it, that God's hand is in the deed, if a deed there is to be; that He has a purpose, and will bring it to good, and will show us that it is good, in His own time? Let us not doubt, may we never have cause to doubt, that He is with us. Continually do I pray that He would discover to me if I am under a delusion; what can I do more? What hope have I but in Him? To whom should I go? Who can do me any good? Who can speak a word of comfort but He? Who is there but looks on me with a sorrowful face??but He can lift up the light of His countenance upon me. All is against me?may He not add Himself as an adversary? May He tell me, may I listen to Him if His will is other than I think it to be!  So, my dear Jemima, if you can suggest any warnings to me which I am not considering, well, and thank you; else do take comfort, and think that perhaps you have a right to have faith in me, perhaps you have a right to believe that He who has led me hitherto will not suffer me to go wrong. I am somehow in better spirits this morning, and I say what it occurs to me to say at the time. Have I not a right to ask you not to say, as you have said in your letter, that I shall do wrong? What right have you to judge me? Have the multitude who will judge me any right to judge me? Who of my equals, who of the many who will talk flippantly about me, has a right? Who has a right to judge me but my Judge? Who has taken such, pains to know my duty (poor as they have been) as myself? Who is more likely than I to know what I ought to do? I may be wrong, but He that judgeth me is the Lord, and 'Judge nothing before the time.'  His ways are not our ways, nor His thoughts as our thoughts. He may have purposes as merciful as they are beyond us. Let us do our best, and leave the event to Him? He will give us strength to bear. Surely I have to bear most; and if I do not shrink from bearing it others must not shrink. May I do my best; am I not trying to do my best?-may we not trust it will turn to the best?

       On March 12, 1876...  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  Hell  "On future punishmenton hell.  First, we are not fair judges of the malignity of sin.   1. Because like men who have ever lived in a mine, and never seen the light of day.  2. Because skill in any art (and so in holiness) raises the standard.  3. Because culprits make bad judges.  Secondly, God is a consuming fire; sanctity burns what is not holy.  Thirdly, consider Scripture. St. John Bapt., 'burn up the chaff'Matt. xxv., Mark ix., fireSt. Luke, Dives and LazarusSt. Paul, St. Peter, St. John, St. Jude. "

       For Friday   Short Meditations on the Stations of the Cross  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   The Fifth Station Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus to carry the Cross   "V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  Jesus could bear His Cross alone, did He so will; but He permits Simon to help Him, in order to remind us that we must take part in His sufferings, and have a fellowship in His work. His merit is infinite, yet He condescends to let His people add their merit to it. The sanctity of the Blessed Virgin, the blood of the Martyrs, the prayers and penances of the Saints, the good deeds of all the faithful, take part in that work which, nevertheless, is perfect without them. He saves us by His blood, but it is through and with ourselves that He saves us. Dear Lord, teach us to suffer with Thee, make it pleasant to us to suffer for Thy sake, and sanctify all our sufferings by the merits of Thy own.  Pater, Ave, &c.    The Sixth Station The Face of Jesus is wiped by Veronica   V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  Jesus let the pious woman carry off an impression of His Sacred Countenance, which was to last to future ages. He did this to remind us all, that His image must ever be impressed on all our hearts. Whoever we are, in whatever part of the earth, in whatever age of the world, Jesus must live in our hearts. We may differ from each other in many things, but in this we must all agree, if we are His true children. We must bear about with us the napkin of St. Veronica; we must ever meditate upon His death and resurrection, we must ever imitate His divine excellence, according to our measure. Lord, let our countenances be ever pleasing in Thy sight, not defiled with sin, but bathed and washed white in Thy precious blood.  Pater, Ave, &c. "

       For Thursday  "O most Sacred, most loving Heart of Jesus, Thou art concealed in the Holy Eucharist, and Thou beatest for us still. Now as then Thou savest,  Desiderio desideravi -'With desire I have desired.' I worship Thee then with all my best love and awe, with my fervent affection, with my most subdued, most resolved will. O my God, when Thou dost condescend to suffer me to receive Thee, to eat and drink Thee, and Thou for a while takest up Thy abode within me, O make my heart beat with Thy Heart. Purify it of all that is earthly, all that is proud and sensual, all that is hard and cruel, of all perversity, of all disorder, of all deadness. So fill it with Thee, that neither the events of the day nor the circumstances of the time may have power to ruffle it, but that in Thy love and Thy fear it may have peace.

       On March 10, 1882...  Venerable John Henry  Cardinal Newman, C.O., wrote a letter to a friend which included the following paragraph:  "How the old generation is fading away, out of sight! What a mystery is life, and how it comes home to such as me to think of old Nestor's melancholy lines, 'as the outburst and fall of leaves, such the generations of man.' How inwardly miserable must the life of man be, without the Gospel, and now men are doing their utmost to destroy our sole solace ... "

       The Feast of St. John Ogilvie, S.J., Priest and Martyr  is today. There is information on him  urlLink here.  Since I spend so much time blogging on the Martyrs of England and Wales, it's probably only fair to mention this Scottish martyr as well.   It is also the feast of  urlLink St. Dominic Savio , and of  urlLink St. John of Vallumbrosa.   While the former is a great model of youthful purity, I find the latter even more interesting because he was a penitent who had once been ensnared by the occult- a growing temptation in our world today.

       On March 9, 1851  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive: " On the Accepted Time   1. INTROD.Lent an apostolical observance.  2. And well did it become the Divine Mercy to appoint a time for repentance, who had in the fulness of time died for our redemption. For what is every one's business is no one's; what is for all times is for no time.  3. And even those who will not take God's time, feel a time there must be. They always profess a time; they quiet their conscience by naming a time; but when?  4. 'Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season,' etc., Acts xxiv. 24-25 . When the present temptation is out of the way. When the present business or trouble is got through. When they have enjoyed life a little more.  5. When 'a little more,' for there is no satisfaction in sin, each sin is the last. But the thirst comes again; there is no term at which we can quit it; it is like drinking salt waterhorizon recedes.  6. End of life, time of retirement. The seriousness will come as a matter of course; passions will naturally burn out otium cum dignitate alas, the change of nature is not the coming of grace. We may change, but we shall not be nearer heaven. To near heaven is not a natural change, but a specific work, as much as building a house. It is not a growth till there is something to grow from.  7. Feeling then there must be a time, and having the conscience of men on this point with her, the Church appoints a time and says, 'Now is the appointed time.' She blows the trumpet; proclaims forgiveness; an indulgencescattering giftsinviting all to come and claim. Not sternly, but most lovingly and persuasively she does it.  8. Oh for those who have neglected the summons hitherto, year after year, conscience pleading!  9. Or perhaps we have repented just through Lent and then relapsed and undone, and more than undone, all.  10. And so we get older, older, and farther from heaven every year, till we come to our last Lent, and we do not keep it a bit the better.  11. Then we come near death, yet won't believe that death is near. Set thy house in orderpacking up, and how many things left out. We cannot realise it. All hurry and confusion. Between illness, delirium, weakness, relations, worldly affairs, etc., we shall be able to recollect nothingall in disorder. No real contrition. And so we die.  12. Ah! then in that very moment of death we shall recollect everything; all things will come before us. We shall wish to speak; it will be too late. We shall have passed from this life; the accepted time will have passed by. "

       Just because  "Be sure, my Brethren, that this must be our way too. Never does God give faith, but He tries it, and none without faith can enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore all ye who come to serve God, all ye who wish to save your souls, begin with making up your minds that you cannot do so, without a generous faith, a generous self-surrender; without putting yourselves into God's hands, making no bargain with Him, not stipulating conditions, but saying 'O Lord here I am-I will be whatever Thou wilt ask me-I will go whithersoever Thou sendest me-I will bear whatever Thou puttest upon me. Not in my own might or my own strength. My strength is very weakness-if I trust in myself more or less, I shall fail-but I trust in Thee-I trust and I know that Thou wilt aid me to do, what Thou callest on me to do-I trust and I know that Thou wilt never leave me nor forsake me. Never wilt Thou bring me into any trial, which Thou wilt not bring me through. Never will there be a failing on Thy part, never will there be a lack of grace. I shall have all and abound. I shall be tried: my reason will be tried, for I shall have to believe; my affections will be tried, for I shall have to obey Thee instead of pleasing myself; my flesh will be tried, for I shall have to bring it into subjection. But Thou art more to me than all other things put together. Thou canst make up to me all Thou takest from me and Thou wilt, for Thou wilt give to me Thyself. Thou wilt guide me.'

       On March 7, 1848  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., wrote the following two meditations. Part of the first one is particularly famous...  "1. God was all-complete, all-blessed in Himself; but it was His will to create a world for His glory. He is Almighty, and might have done all things Himself, but it has been His will to bring about His purposes by the beings He has created. We are all  created to His glory-we are created to do His will. I am created to do something or to be something for which no one else is created; I have a place in God's counsels, in God's world, which no one else has; whether I be rich or poor, despised or esteemed by man, God knows me and calls me by my name.  2. God has created me to do Him some definite service; He has committed some work to me which He has not committed to another. I have my mission-I never may know it in this life, but I shall be told it in the next. Somehow I am necessary for His purposes, as necessary in my place as an Archangel in his-if, indeed, I fail, He can raise another, as He could make the stones children of Abraham. Yet I have a part in this great work; I am a link in a chain, a bond of connexion between persons. He has not created me for naught. I shall do good, I shall do His work; I shall be an angel of peace, a preacher of truth in my own place, while not intending it, if I do but keep His commandments and serve Him in my calling.  3. Therefore I will trust Him. Whatever, wherever I am, I can never be thrown away. If I am in sickness, my sickness may serve Him; in perplexity, my perplexity may serve Him; if I am in sorrow, my sorrow may serve Him. My sickness, or perplexity, or sorrow may be necessary causes of some great end, which is quite beyond us. He does nothing in vain; He may prolong my life, He may shorten it; He knows what He is about. He may take away my friends, He may throw me among strangers, He  may make me feel desolate, make my spirits sink, hide the future from me-still He knows what He is about.  O Adonai, O Ruler of Israel, Thou that guidest Joseph like a flock, O Emmanuel, O Sapientia, I give myself to Thee. I trust Thee wholly. Thou art wiser than I-more loving to me than I myself. Deign to fulfil Thy high purposes in me whatever they be-work in and through me. I am born to serve Thee, to be Thine, to be Thy instrument. Let me be Thy blind instrument. I ask not to see-I ask not to know-I ask simply to be used.    1. What mind of man can imagine the love which the Eternal Father bears towards the Only Begotten Son? It has been from everlasting,-and it is infinite; so great is it that divines call the Holy Ghost by the name of that love, as if to express its infinitude and perfection. Yet reflect, O my soul, and bow down before the awful mystery, that, as the Father loves the Son, so doth the Son love thee, if thou art one of His elect; for He says expressly, 'As the Father hath loved Me, I also have loved you. Abide in My love.' What mystery in the whole circle of revealed truths is greater than this?  2. The love which the Son bears to thee, a creature, is like that which the Father bears to the uncreated Son. O wonderful mystery! This, then, is the history of what else is so strange: that He should have taken my flesh and died for me. The former mystery anticipates the latter; that latter does but fulfil the former. Did He not love me so inexpressibly, He would not have suffered for me. I understand now why He died for me, because He loved me as a father loves his son-not as a human father merely, but as the Eternal Father the Eternal Son. I see now the meaning of that else inexplicable humiliation: He preferred to regain me rather than to create new worlds.  3. How constant is He in His affection! He has loved us from the time of Adam. He has said from the beginning, 'I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.' He did not forsake us in our sin. He did not forsake me. He found me out and regained me. He made a point of it-He resolved to restore me, in spite of myself, to that blessedness which I was so obstinately set against. And now what does He ask of me, but that, as He has loved me with an everlasting love, so I should love Him in such poor measures as I can show.  O mystery of mysteries, that the ineffable love of Father to Son should be the love of the Son to us! Why was it, O Lord? What good thing didst Thou see in me a sinner? Why wast Thou set on me? 'What is man, that Thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that Thou visitest him?' This poor flesh of mine, this weak sinful soul, which has no life except in Thy grace, Thou didst set Thy love upon it. Complete Thy work, O Lord, and as Thou hast loved me from the beginning, so make me to love Thee unto the end. "   Meditations and Devotions

       For Saturday  "If we placed our Lord in that centre, we should only be dragging Him from His throne, and making Him an Arian kind of a God; that is, no God at all. He who charges us with making Mary a divinity, is thereby denying the divinity of Jesus. Such a man does not know what divinity is. Our Lord cannot pray for us, as a creature prays, as Mary prays; He cannot inspire those feelings which a creature inspires. To her belongs, as being a creature, a natural claim on our sympathy and familiarity, in that she is nothing else than our fellow. She is our pride,-in the poet's words, 'Our tainted nature's solitary boast'. We look to her without any fear, any remorse, any consciousness that she is able to read us, judge us, punish us. Our heart yearns towards that pure Virgin, that gentle Mother, and our congratulations follow her, as she rises from Nazareth and Ephesus, through the choirs of angels, to her throne on high, so weak, yet so strong; so delicate, yet so glorious; so modest and yet so mighty. She has sketched for us her own portrait in the Magnificat. 'He hath regarded the low estate of His hand-maid; for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. He hath put down the mighty from their seat; and hath exalted the humble. He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath sent empty away.' "- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  A Letter Addressed to the Rev. E. B. Pusey, D.D., on Occasion of His Eirenicon

       Short Meditations on the Stations of the Cross  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  The Seventh Station Jesus falls a second time   "V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  Satan had a second fall, when our Lord came upon earth. By that time he had usurped the dominion of the whole world-and he called himself its king. And he dared to take up the Holy Saviour in his arms, and show Him all kingdoms, and blasphemously promise to give them to Him, His Maker, if He would adore him. Jesus answered, 'Begone, Satan!'-and Satan fell down from the high mountain. And Jesus bare witness to it when He said, 'I saw Satan, as lightning, falling from heaven.' The Evil One remembered this second defeat, and so now he smote down the Innocent Lord a second time, now that he had Him in his power. O dear Lord, teach us to suffer with Thee, and not be afraid of Satan's buffetings, when they come on us from resisting him.  Pater, Ave, &c.   The Eighth Station The Women of Jerusalem mourn for Our Lord   V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  Ever since the prophecy of old time, that the Saviour of man was to be born of a woman of the stock of Abraham, the Jewish women had desired to bear Him. Yet, now that He was really come, how different, as the Gospel tells us, was the event from what they had expected. He said to them 'that the days were coming when they should say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the breasts which have not given suck.' Ah, Lord, we know not what is good for us, and what is bad. We cannot foretell the future, nor do we know, when Thou comest to visit us, in what form Thou wilt come. And therefore we leave it all to Thee. Do Thou Thy good pleasure to us and in us. Let us ever look at Thee, and do Thou look upon us, and give us the grace of Thy bitter Cross and Passion, and console us in Thy own way and at Thy own time.  Pater, Ave, &c. "

"I cannot forget how it was from Rome that the glorious St. Patrick was sent to Ireland, and did a work so great that he could not have a successor in it, the sanctity and learning and zeal and charity which followed on his death being but the result of the one impulse which he gave. I cannot forget how, in no long time, under the fostering breath of the Vicar of Christ, a country of heathen superstitions became the very wonder and asylum of all people,the wonder by reason of its knowledge, sacred and profane, and the asylum of religion, literature and science, when chased away from the continent by the barbarian invaders. I recollect its hospitality, freely accorded to the pilgrim; its volumes munificently presented to the foreign student; and the prayers, the blessings, the holy rites, the solemn chants, which sanctified the while both giver and receiver."- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  The Idea of a University     It is also the feast of  urlLink St. Joseph of Arimathea , who gave the Lord his own tomb, and  urlLink St. Jan Sarkander , who was martyred for refusing to break the seal of the confessional.

       Just because...   The Forbearance of Jesus   Videte manus meas, etc. Habetis aliquid quod manducetur? See my hands, etc. Have you here anything to eat?  1. I adore Thee, O my Lord, for Thy wonderful patience and Thy compassionate tenderhearted condescension. Thy disciples, in spite of all Thy teaching and miracles, disbelieved Thee when they saw Thee die, and fled. Nor did they take courage afterwards, nor think of Thy promise of rising again on the third day. They did not believe Magdalen, nor the other women, who said they had seen Thee alive again. Yet Thou didst appear to themThou didst show them Thy woundsThou didst let them touch TheeThou didst eat before them, and give them Thy peace. O Jesu, is any obstinacy too great for Thy love? does any number of falls and relapses vanquish the faithfulness and endurance of Thy compassion? Thou dost forgive not only seven times, but to seventy times seven. Many waters cannot quench a love like Thine. And such Thou art all over the earth, even to the endforgiving, sparing, forbearing, waiting, though sinners are ever provoking Thee; pitying and taking into account their ignorance, visiting all men, all Thine enemies, with the gentle pleadings of Thy grace, day after day, year after year, up to the hour of their deathfor He knoweth whereof we are made; He knoweth we are but dust.  2. My God, what hast Thou done for me! Men say of Thee, O my only Good, that Thy judgments are severe, and Thy punishments excessive. All I can say is, that I have not found them so in my own case. Let others speak for themselves, and Thou wilt meet and overcome them to their own confusion in the day of reckoning. With them I have nothing to doThou wilt settle with thembut for me the only experience that I have is Thy dealings with myself, and here I bear witness, as I know so entirely and feel so intimately, that to me Thou hast been nothing but forbearance and mercy. O how Thou dost forget that I have ever rebelled against Thee! Again and again dost Thou help me. I fall, yet Thou dost not cast me off. In spite of all my sins, Thou dost still love me, prosper me, comfort me, surround me with blessings, sustain me, and further me. I grieve Thy good grace, yet Thou dost give more. I insult Thee, yet Thou never dost take offence, but art as kind as if I had nothing to explain, to repent of, to amendas if I were Thy best, most faithful, most steady and loyal friend. Nay, alas! I am even led to presume upon Thy love, it is so like easiness and indulgence, though I ought to fear Thee. I confess it, O my true Saviour, every day is but a fresh memorial of Thy unwearied, unconquerable love!  3. O my God, suffer me stillbear with me in spite of my waywardness, perverseness, and ingratitude! I improve very slowly, but really I am moving on to heaven, or at least I wish to move. I am putting Thee before me, vile sinner as I am, and I am really thinking in earnest of saving my soul. Give me time to collect my thoughts, and make one good effort. I protest I will put off this languor and lukewarmnessI will shake myself from this sullenness and despondency and gloomI will rouse myself, and be cheerful, and walk in Thy light. I will have no hope or joy but Thee. Only give me Thy gracemeet me with Thy grace, I will through Thy grace do what I canand Thou shalt perfect it for me. Then I shall have happy days in Thy presence, and in the sight and adoration of Thy five Sacred Wounds. " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Meditations and Devotions

       On March 15, 1879...  A letter was sent from the Vatican to the Birmingham Oratory...  Official Offer of the Cardinalate. Cardinal Nina to Fr. Newman.   "VERY REV. FATHER, The Holy Father deeply appreciating the genius and learning which distinguish you, your piety, the zeal displayed by you in the exercise of the Holy Ministry, your devotion and filial attachment to the Holy Apostolic See, and the signal services you have for long years rendered to religion, has decided on giving you a public and solemn proof of his esteem and good-will. And to this end he will deign to raise you to the honours of the Sacred Purple, in the next Consistory, the precise day of which will be notified to you in due time.  In forwarding you this joyful announcement by its fitting and prescribed channel, I cannot refrain from congratulating your Paternity on seeing your merits rewarded in so splendid a manner by the august Head of the Church, and I rejoice in heart that I shall very soon have you as a colleague in the Sacred Senate, of which you will not fail to be one of the chief ornaments.  Accept, I entreat you, this expression of my regard, and at the same time the assurance of the particular esteem with which I sign myself, Of your Very Rev. Paternity, The true servant, L. CARD. NINA. "  This elicited the following response: "MY LORD CARDINAL, Were I to delay my answer to the very generous communication your Eminence deigned to make to me on the part of his Holiness, until I could write what seems to be befitting and adequate to express all the feeling of my heart, I fear that I should never write at all. For the longer I think of it, the more generous and gracious the condescension of the Holy Father seems to me, and the more deeply I feel that I am altogether unworthy of it.  I am overpowered, first of all, by the weight of the high dignity to which the Holy Father condescends to raise me, and still more by the words he has used to announce to me his intention, words breathing a goodness so fatherly, and implying an approval the more touching and precious that it is the Vicar of Christ who awards it.  I venture to hope that the Holy Father will allow me, as soon as the weather becomes milder, and the journey less toilsome, to present myself before his sacred person, that I may try to tell him how deeply I feel his immense goodness, and may receive his apostolic blessing.  I cannot close this letter, my Lord Cardinal, without begging you to accept the homage of my profound respect and my deep-felt gratitude for the kind courtesy with which you have condescended to discharge the commission of his Holiness.  I have the honour to kiss the Sacred Purple and to be Your Eminence's most humble and devoted servant, JOHN H. NEWMAN. "

       Now,  this  is beautiful....  "The Passion," as Seen by a Woman Religious  Sister Joseph Andrew Bogdanowicz on 3 Key Moments   A woman religious offers her view on key parts of the film "The Passion of the Christ."   * * *   Three Moments of "The Passion of the Christ"   By Sister Joseph Andrew Bogdanowicz, OP  Dominican Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist   "Viewing 'The Passion of the Christ' affects each person in an individual manner. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the film's portrayal of the last 12 hours of Christ's life on earth, the majority of this depiction of these most sacred hours is rooted in the various Evangelists' accounts found in Scripture.   As a woman religious, I viewed 'The Passion' through the eyes of my own feminine nature and the spousal vigilance proper to one whose freely made avowal of the evangelical counsels identifies me as 'sponsa Christi.' Through such eyes, I have chosen three scenes which have become as the heartbeat of my reflections.   From the opening scenes, I realized that I could not identify with Christ as such. That identification would be more fitting for a priest, who, as 'alter Christus,' finds his likeness in the God-Man, Jesus Christ.   For me, Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Christ elicited tears wrung from the heart which, I soon understood, was beating as one with Mother Mary's and with all the women portrayed in the film: Mary Magdalene, Veronica, Claudia, the weeping women.   1st: 'All Things New'  I watched Christ, I walked with him, I desired to wipe the dirt (which as a woman so bothered me) plastered with ever increasing thickness upon his holy face.   My admiration of Christ's Mother grew as, deep within my own being, I reacted to the bloodthirsty crowds which swirled in mad frenzy throughout the film in their physical and mental brutality toward Christ.   I felt my own body lean toward the screen and had to hold myself back to prevent the release my heart sought. I wanted to shout Simon's later words: 'Stop! Haven't you done enough? Stop!'   But she, the Mother, did not; neither did he, the Son and innocent victim. Rather, when the Mother, following the manly logic of John's directions, was able to approach her Son, she tenderly said, "I am here!" And he responded by gifting her (and us) with the secret of obtaining the strength necessary for propitious redemptive suffering: 'See, Mother, I make all things new' (Revelation 21:5).   St. Louis de Montfort must have rejoiced anew in heaven at this poignant scene culled from the spiritual reflection of Mel Gibson. Can we not summarize the Marian entrustment which John Paul II's coat of arms has displayed to the world for a quarter of a century now as the simple suggestion, 'Through the Mother to the Son'?   Perhaps the greatest moment of a mother's love is known when her resolute strength emboldens her children for a suffering the world cannot understand but one rooted, by the redemptive value it offers, in the opened heart of the Christ.   2nd: His Presence   A personal spousal moment for me was epitomized when the Mother was wildly running through the streets in search of her bound and already brutally beaten Son.   Upon crossing over the ground which hid his physical presence from her eyes, as he was held in the dungeon below on that fateful night, she instantly knew his presence; and, bending down, she touched her cheek, her heart, to the ground.   Jesus, too, knew his Mother's closeness and, as the cameras fell below the dust to the hollowed and dirty tabernacle below, the viewer is able to catch Jesus reaching out his hand in an invisible embrace with the woman he loves. The One whom 'the rocks like wax melt before his glance' (Judith 16:15) was separated from his Mother, but they still knew a oneness beyond the things of this world.   Similarly, as 'sponsa Christi,' I am not gifted with the marvelous sensible affects a bride comes to know in her husband. Therefore, the interior communication is heightened, and through this I know Christ's presence with me: each morning in Eucharistic adoration with my community, in each holy Communion, and by reaching out to each person my Spouse sends me.   Through my embrace of all people, regardless of their individual strengths and weaknesses, I know the touch of my Spouse and that touch spiritually fructifies our union as I, with him, behold all humanity as my spiritual children.   3rd: The Pietà, and priests   The third moment which I wish to point out is that immortalized by Michelangelo's famed Pietà. The Son lies in the lap of the Mother once again. Though the Man of Sorrows is now dead, I cannot view this scene as anything but Hope Personified.   As a woman and as a religious sister, this scene calls me to carry, support and love each individual priest whom the Almighty Father places within the radius of my heart's care; ultimately, all priests.   As the wife is made, by holy marriage, the helpmate of her husband, I, a religious sister, become, by virtue of my vocation, the helpmate par excellence of each priest.   When the priest is young, healthy and dynamic, my love is there to prayerfully support him, as Mary supported her Son, oftentimes from what might appear to others as afar.   When the priest must carry his cross for the salvation of the world, I wish to accompany him in my role as co-martyr for the fecundity of the children of God.   And when he appears broken, spent, given, I wish that it be my heart -- through my prayers, sacrifices and support -- upon which he might find peaceful rest. Without him, I have no Eucharistic Spouse; with him, the Church is given Christ until the end of time.   In his role at daily Mass, the priest shows me, again, what it means to be Mary: at the birth in Bethlehem, during her Son's public life of preaching and healing, in the silence of unitive prayer, and, finally, in receiving his Body when Calvary is completed.   With 'alter Christus,' the religious woman as bride awaits the promised resurrection even as she hears a familiar voice within assuring her: Mother, behold I make all things new.'  Would I advise everyone to experience this movie, even those who have no Christian background? My answer is 'yes' without hesitation.   All persons are made in the likeness of God and thus are 'imago Dei.' The Angelic (Dominican) Doctor of the Church, St. Thomas Aquinas, assures us: 'The light of your face, Lord, is signed upon us' ("Summa Theologiae," I-II, q. 91, a.2). The Apostle John gives us a one-word name for God: 'Love."  We were made by Love; for Love; and to receive and give this Love who is God.   I submit this movie has the power to resonate in all hearts because it is the greatest Love story. With faith, one can only fall back in adoration ... knowing here is a Man who loves me.

        A comment from Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  in which the subject of today's First Reading is mentioned: "God spoke to Moses in the burning bush, and called Himself the 'God of Abraham;' and Christ tells us, that in this simple announcement was contained the promise that Abraham should rise again from the dead. In truth, if we may say it with reverence, the All-wise, All-knowing God cannot speak without meaning many things at once. He sees the end from the beginning; He understands the numberless connexions and relations of all things one with another. Every word of His is full of instruction, looking many ways; and though it is not often given to us to know these various senses, and we are not at liberty to attempt lightly to imagine them, yet, as far as they are told us, and as far as we may reasonably infer them, we must thankfully accept them. Look at Christ's words, and this same character of them will strike you; whatever He says is fruitful in meaning, and refers to many things. It is well to keep this in mind when we read Scripture; for it may hinder us from self-conceit, from studying it in an arrogant critical temper, and from giving over reading it, as if we had got from it all that can be learned."-  Parochial and Plain Sermons

       For Saturday   Mary is the "Vas Insigne Devotionis," The Most Devout Virgin  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   " To be  devout  is to be devoted. We know what is meant by a devoted wife or daughter. It is one whose thoughts centre in the person so deeply loved, so tenderly cherished. She follows him about with her eyes; she is ever seeking some means of serving him; and, if her services are very small in their character, that only shows how intimate they are, and how incessant. And especially if the object of her love be weak, or in pain, or near to die, still more intensely does she live in his life, and know nothing but him.  This intense devotion towards our Lord, forgetting self in love for Him, is instanced in St. Paul, who says. 'I know nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified.' And again, 'I live, [yet] now not I, but Christ liveth in me; and [the life] that I now live in the flesh, I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered Himself for me.'  But great as was St. Paul's devotion to our Lord, much greater was that of the Blessed Virgin; because she was His Mother, and because she had Him and all His sufferings actually before her eyes, and because she had the long intimacy of thirty years with Him, and because she was from her special sanctity so ineffably near to Him in spirit. When, then, He was mocked, bruised, scourged, and nailed to the Cross, she felt as keenly as if every indignity and torture inflicted on Him was struck at herself. She could have cried out in agony at every pang of His.   This is called her compassion, or her suffering with her Son, and it arose from this that she was the 'Vas insigne  devotionis .'

       Short Meditations on the Stations of the Cross  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  The Ninth Station Jesus falls the third time   " V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  Satan will have a third and final fall at the end of the world, when he will be shut up for good in the everlasting fiery prison. He knew this was to be his end-he has no hope, but despair only. He knew that no suffering which he could at that moment inflict upon the Saviour of men would avail to rescue himself from that inevitable doom. But, in horrible rage and hatred, he determined to insult and torture while he could the great King whose throne is everlasting. Therefore a third time he smote Him down fiercely to the earth. O Jesus, Only-begotten Son of God, the Word Incarnate, we adore with fear and trembling and deep thankfulness Thy awful humiliation, that Thou who art the Highest, should have permitted Thyself, even for one hour, to be the sport and prey of the Evil One.  Pater, Ave, &c.    The Tenth Station Jesus is stripped of His Garments   V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  Jesus would give up everything of this world, before He left it. He exercised the most perfect poverty. When He left the Holy House of Nazareth, and went out to preach, He had not where to lay His head. He lived on the poorest food, and on what was given to Him by those who loved and served Him. And therefore He chose a death in which not even His clothes were left to Him. He parted with what seemed most necessary, and even a part of Him, by the law of human nature since the fall. Grant us in like manner, O dear Lord, to care nothing for anything on earth, and to bear the loss of all things, and to endure even shame, reproach, contempt, and mockery, rather than that Thou shalt be ashamed of us at the last day.  Pater, Ave, &c. "

       The Solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord  is today. There is information on it  urlLink here.  "Our sweet Christ, the Word Incarnate, has given Himself to us for every thing that was necessary for us, even to the hard and ignominious death upon the Cross. " - St. Philip Neri  Mary is the "Mater Creatoris," the Mother of the Creator  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "This is a title which, of all others, we should have thought it impossible for any creature to possess. At first sight we might be tempted to say that it throws into confusion our primary ideas of the Creator and the creature, the Eternal and the temporal, the Self-subsisting and the dependent; and yet on further consideration we shall see that we cannot refuse the title to Mary without denying the Divine Incarnation-that is, the great and fundamental truth of revelation, that God became man.  And this was seen from the first age of the Church. Christians were accustomed from the first to call the Blessed Virgin 'The Mother of God,' because they saw that it was impossible to deny her that title without denying St. John's words, 'The Word' (that is, God the Son) 'was made flesh.'  And in no long time it was found necessary to proclaim this truth by the voice of an Ecumenical Council of the Church. For, in consequence of the dislike which men have of a mystery, the error sprang up that our Lord was not really God, but a man, differing from us in this merely-that God dwelt in Him, as God dwells in all good men, only in a higher measure; as the Holy Spirit dwelt in Angels and Prophets, as in a sort of Temple; or again, as our Lord now dwells in the Tabernacle in church. And then the bishops and faithful people found there was no other way of hindering this false, bad view being taught but by declaring distinctly, and making it a point of faith, that Mary was the Mother, not of man only, but of God. And since that time the title of Mary, as  Mother of God , has become what is called a dogma, or article of faith, in the Church.  But this leads us to a larger view of the subject. Is this title as given to Mary more wonderful than the doctrine that God, without ceasing to be God, should become man? Is it more mysterious that Mary should be Mother of God, than that  God  should be  man ? Yet the latter, as I have said, is the elementary truth of revelation, witnessed by Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles all through Scripture. And what can be more consoling and joyful than the wonderful promises which follow from this truth, that Mary is the Mother of God?-the great wonder, namely, that we become the brethren of our God; that, if we live well, and die in the grace of God, we shall all of us hereafter be taken up by our Incarnate God to that place where angels dwell; that our bodies shall be raised from the dust, and be taken to Heaven; that we shall be really united to God; that we shall be partakers of the Divine nature; that each of us, soul and body, shall be plunged into the abyss of glory which surrounds the Almighty; that we shall see Him, and share His blessedness, according to the text, 'Whosoever shall do the will of My Father that is in Heaven, the same is My brother, and sister, and mother.' "-  Meditations and Devotions  There are posts on this feast all over the Catholic Blogosphere, including  urlLink HMS Blog ,  urlLink Gerard Serafin , and  urlLink Fiat Mihi .  urlLink Mark Shea's post   is especially notable, as it also remarks on this being a important anniversary in the Tolkien-verse: the day the One Ring was destroyed and Sauron defeated- a 'sub-created' echo of the True Eucatastrophe which began with a humble woman saying 'yes' to God.  "In Gondor the New Year will always now begin upon the twenty-fifth of March when Sauron fell, and when you were brought out of the fire to the King."

       On March 24, 1850  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  On Our Lord's Agony  "1. INTROD.-We naturally seek to be told something of the death and the deathbeds of those we know and love. We are drawn to the deathbed of the saints and holy people; and much more if anything remarkable about it, and much more if a man be our benefactor, parent, etc. How much more the death of the great God?  2. Thus, above all, our Lord's death-how sudden it was! One day brought into the city in triumph, the next plotted against, betrayed and seized.  3. God from eternity-the Holy Trinity. Each person all God; the Son the only God, as if only Person.   4. God most happy; Son all happy-bliss, peace, calmness, glory, beauty, perfection from all eternity.  5. And now look at that one only God, as we contemplate Him at this time of year. He is still one, sole, and alone. He was one in heaven; He is one in the garden, one on the tree. He trod the winepress alone. When He went into the garden He took but a few with Him, and separated Himself from them; and afterwards the disciples 'left Him alone,' and fled. Easy for the traitor to take Him, for He was alone.  6. But though one and alone, how different! He who was glorious is become a leper; He who was so peaceful has lost His rest.  7. It is said that nothing is so fearful as the overwhelming sorrow of man as contrasted with woman, of a hero or great and firm man overcome by adversity or bereavement; for it being more difficult, it bursts more [violently]; it is like a storm rending and shattering. What, then, in the most peaceful and serene? What a conflict in the sinless!?(enlarge).  8. It is said that 'the wicked are like a boiling sea'; what means this in the innocent? Yet so it is. He began to grow weary, sad, frightened. (Explain.) On the devil, who was foiled in the wilderness, to his surprise finding our Lord in the garden agitated as a sinner. He had gained his point-his eternal enemy vanquished. On the apostles sleeping for sorrow, but Christ praying more earnestly.  9. Pain of mind greater than that of body, though we are more conversant in bodily pain-grief, fear, anxiety, terror, despair, disappointment- poena damni  of the lost greater than  poena sensus . On the effect of mental pain-hair turning white; Nabal . So effect on Christ-agony of blood.  10. Let us gather round and look at Him whom God has punished; but in no idle way, for His pain is from our sins. Address to sinners. "

       The March 2004  First Things   is now  urlLink online.  Here's a short article from that issue, by Fr. Richard John Neuhaus's "While We're At It" section.   "I dont mean to pick on Wesley Clark. On this question there is no substantive difference between him and other politicians who strive to prove their impeccable pro-abortion credentials. But the language is different. Im not going to be appointing judges who are pro-life, he told the  Manchester Union Leader . One imagines an aide whispering, 'Our people do not say "pro-life," General.' Clark also told the paper, 'Until the moment of birth, the government has no right to influence a mothers decision on whether to have an abortion.' That would seem to go beyond  Roe v. Wade , which allows that there is a government interest in unborn life, at least in its later stages, if the mother has no 'health' reason for wanting an abortion, which includes psychological health, which means she has a right to an abortion if she would be distressed by not having an abortion. Again, the difference is not substantive, but the generals language is strikingly blunt. Then, on the allegedly complex but obviously obvious question of when life begins, the general accepts the price of medical and metaphysical incoherence in order to win the Most Candid Candidate Award. He says, 'Life begins with the mothers decision.' (Unless, presumably, she later decides to have the child killed.) Clarks statement does have the quasi-Cartesian clarity that drives the pro-abortion movement, even if most of them hesitate to put it so unequivocally: I decide this is not a human life; ergo this is not a human life. More generally stated: I think it is not; ergo it is not. The principle has breathtakingly large potential for the alleviation of inconvenient reality. Yes, there is a price to be paid, but is sanity really so important? "

       On March 23, 1851...  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  On the Strong Man of Sin and Unbelief  "1. INTROD.'The strong man' represents the sinner in his strength and security. It represents him fortified by his three friendsthe world, the flesh, and the devil. 'The old man,' Eph. iv. 22 , the old Adam, the evil spirit who has taken possession of him.  2. He has a 'house.' It is a castle: nor is it the work of a day. How long it takes to build a castle! and buildings grow up about it, fort after fort, treasure house after treasure house, viz. by habits. (Explain about habits.) No one remains without them; they are intended to be a defence for the good. They also become a defence in wickedness. Supernatural habits and natural habits.  3. Absence of faith'The light that is in them.' His standard of thingsscoffs at things supernatural; does not think himself a bad man because he does not pray; is in 'peace'; perfectly satisfied with his standard; may not come up to it; is firmly seated. He may be educated, learned, able, etc.; this only increases the evil.  4. Enormous strength of a bad man. His  vis inertiae , his  momentum . In his black panoply, armed  cap-à-pie   like a knight in story, such the bad man. Then fancy a host of them, the rulers of this world, like a bodyguard of Satan, or his 'guards.'  5. Such are the enemies of Christ, described in the Gospel: 'We wrestle not against,' etc., Eph. vi. 12. Then Christ's grace more powerful: 'A stronger than he,' etc.  6. No one can come up to the strength of God's gracestronger than the elements; stronger than miracles. It bears up against anything; it overcomes everything. On the wonderful way in which Christianity overthrew the establishment of paganism ( vide  Döllinger).  7. Let this be your comfort if you feel afraid, and have to do a great work. God's grace can convert; it has converted from sin of whatever kind. "  (Note: The sermon apparently used some of the researches of the famous ecclesiastical historian  urlLink Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger . Twenty years later, Döllinger was excommunicated for refusing to accept the dogma of papal infallibility. The Venerable was among the many people who attempted to get him to come to his senses, but he refused, and died out of communion with the Church. Sad. )

        The odd phenomenon    of certain people who are able to explain away any and all Scriptural and historical that Catholicism might be true is, alas, not a new thing.... "I say, the more numerous and striking are the evidences of the divinity of the Church, so much the more conclusively are they retorted against her, when men assume at starting that she comes, not from above, but from below. Does she claim to be sent from God? but Antichrist will claim it too. Do men bow before her, 'and lick up the dust from her feet'? but on the other hand, it is said of the apocalyptic sorceress also, that the kings of the earth shall be made 'drunk with her wine.' Does the Church receive the homage of 'the islands, and the ships of the sea'? The answer is ready; for it is expressly said in Scripture that the evil woman shall make 'the merchants of the earth rich by the abundance of her delicacies.' Is the Church honoured with 'the gold and frankincense of Saba, the multitude of camels, the dromedaries of Madian, and the flocks of Cedar"? Her impious rival, too, will be clothed 'in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold,' and enriched with 'beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots.' Does the Church exercise a power over the soul? The enchantress, too, will be possessed, not only of the goods of this world, but of "the souls of men.' Was it promised to the sons of the Church to do miracles? Antichrist is to do 'lying wonders.' Do they exhibit a meekness and a firmness most admirable, a marvellous self-denial, a fervency in prayer, and a charity? It is answered: 'This only makes them more dangerous. Do you not know that Satan can transform himself into an angel of light?' Are they, according to our Lord's bidding, like sheep, defenceless and patient? This does but fulfil a remarkable prophecy, it is retorted; for the second beast, which came up out of the earth, 'had two horns like a lamb's, while it spoke like a dragon.'Does the Church fulfil the Scripture description of being weak and yet strong, of conquering by yielding, of having nothing yet gaining all things, and of exercising power without wealth or station? This wonderful fact, which ought surely to startle the most obstinate, is assigned, not to the power of God, but to some political art or conspiracy. Angels walk the earth in vain; to the gross prejudice of the multitude their coming and going is the secret plotting, as they call it, of 'monks and Jesuits.' Good forsooth it cannot, shall not be; rather believe anything than that it comes from God; believe in a host of invisible traitors prowling about and disseminating doctrine adverse to your own, believe us to be liars and deceivers, men of blood, ministers of hell, rather than turn your minds, by way of solving the problem, to the possibility of our being what we say we are, the children and servants of the true Church. There never was a more successful artifice than this, which the author of evil has devised against his Maker, that God's work is not God's but his own. He has spread this abroad in the world, as thieves in a crowd escape by giving the alarm; and men, in their simplicity, run away from Christ as if Christ were he, and run into his arms as if he were Christ."- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  Sermons on Various Occasions

       On April 3, 1870  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive.  Gospel for Passion Sunday   "1. INTROD.We veil our crosses. On the various gospels descriptive of our Lord's hiding Himself.  2. He hid Himself from the Jews because they had refused the light.  3. He is the light of the world and the light of the soul.  4. Abraham had first 'seen' Him-on Moriah-and the other prophets, as if mounted on high. And all the Jews, though they had not seen Him, had heard of Him and expected Him. He was the 'expectation of the nations.'  5. At length 'He came unto His own,' etc. 'The light shineth in the darkness.'  6. A warning to all of us lest we receive the grace of God in vain. A  yearly  warning.  7. We cannot be as others. We have had great opportunities. We mix with Protestants. They have their own views. They argue and conclude on their own basis. They are sharp and clever men of business; good politicians; on  their own  principles right. No wonder they think so differently, for the great bulk of them have not seen what we have seen. But Luke x. 23-24 .  8. O let us beware lest we ever get blinded. Isa. vi. 9-10 .  9. 'Strive to enter the strait gate: for many, I say to you, shall seek to enter, and shall not be able,' Luke xiii. 24. "

       Short Meditations on the Stations of the Cross  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   The Eleventh Station Jesus is nailed to the Cross   "V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  Jesus is pierced through each hand and each foot with a sharp nail. His eyes are dimmed with blood, and are closed by the swollen lids and livid brows which the blows of His executioners have caused. His mouth is filled with vinegar and gall. His head is encircled by the sharp thorns. His heart is pierced with the spear. Thus, all His senses are mortified and crucified, that He may make atonement for every kind of human sin. O Jesus, mortify and crucify us with Thee. Let us never sin by hand or foot, by eyes or mouth, or by head or heart. Let all our senses be a sacrifice to Thee; let every member sing Thy praise. Let the sacred blood which flowed from Thy five wounds anoint us with such sanctifying grace that we may die to the world, and live only to Thee.  Pater, Ave, &c.    The Twelfth Station Jesus dies upon the Cross   V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  "Consummatum  est." It is completed-it has come to a full end. The mystery of God's love towards us is accomplished. The price is paid, and we are redeemed. The Eternal Father determined not to pardon us without a price, in order to show us especial favour. He condescended to make us valuable to Him. What we buy we put a value on. He might have saved us without a price-by the mere fiat of His will. But to show His love for us He took a price, which, if there was to be a price set upon us at all, if there was any ransom at all to be taken for the guilt of our sins, could be nothing short of the death of His Son in our nature. O my God and Father, Thou hast valued us so much as to pay the highest of all possible prices for our sinful souls-and shall we not love and choose Thee above all things as the one necessary and one only good?  Pater, Ave, &c.    The Thirteenth Station Jesus is laid in the arms of His Blessed Mother   V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  He is Thy property now, O Virgin Mother, once again, for He and the world have met and parted. He went out from Thee to do His Father's work-and He has done and suffered it. Satan and bad men have now no longer any claim upon Him-too long has He been in their arms. Satan took Him up aloft to the high mountain; evil men lifted Him up upon the Cross. He has not been in Thy arms, O Mother of God, since He was a child-but now thou hast a claim upon Him, when the world has done its worst. For thou art the all-favoured, all-blessed, all-gracious Mother of the Highest. We rejoice in this great mystery. He has been hidden in thy womb, He has lain in thy bosom, He has been suckled at thy breasts, He has been carried in thy arms-and now that He is dead, He is placed upon thy lap. Virgin Mother of God, pray for us.  Pater, Ave, &c.    The Fourteenth Station Jesus is laid in the Sepulchre   V. Adoramus te, Christe, et benedicimus tibi. R. Quia per sanctam Crucem tuam redemisti mundum.  Jesus, when He was nearest to His everlasting triumph, seemed to be farthest from triumphing. When He was nearest upon entering upon His kingdom, and exercising all power in heaven and earth, He was lying dead in a cave of the rock. He was wrapped round in burying-clothes, and confined within a sepulchre of stone, where He was soon to have a glorified spiritual body, which could penetrate all substances, go to and fro quicker than thought, and was about to ascend on high. Make us to trust in thee, O Jesus, that Thou wilt display in us a similar providence. Make us sure, O Lord, that the greater is our distress, the nearer we are to Thee. The more men scorn us, the more Thou dost honour us. The more men insult over us, the higher Thou wilt exalt us. The more they forget us, the more Thou dost keep us in mind. The more they abandon us, the closer Thou wilt bring us to Thyself.  Pater, Ave, &c.  LET US PRAY  God, who by the Precious Blood of Thy only-begotten Son didst sanctify the standard of the Cross, grant, we beseech Thee, that we who rejoice in the glory of the same Holy Cross may at all times and places rejoice in Thy protection, through the same Christ, our Lord.  End with one Pater, Ave, and Gloria, for the intention of the Sovereign Pontiff. "

O my Saviour, Thou shalt be my sole God!-I will have no Lord but Thee. I will break to pieces all idols in my heart which rival Thee. I will have nothing but Jesus and Him crucified. It shall be my life to pray to Thee, to offer myself to Thee, to keep Thee before me, to worship Thee in Thy holy Sacrifice, and to surrender myself to Thee in Holy Communion.

       A quote...  from Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., dealing with today's First Reading: "The Three Holy Children are said to have stood up in the midst of the fire, and to have called on all the works of God to rejoice with them; on sun and moon, stars of heaven, nights and days, showers and dew, frost and cold, lightnings and clouds, mountains and hills, green things upon the earth, seas and floods, fowls of the air, beasts and cattle, and children of men,-to praise and bless the Lord, and magnify Him for ever. We have no such trial as theirs; we have no such awful suspense as theirs, when they entered the burning fiery furnace; we attempt for the most part what we know; we begin what we think we can go through. We can neither instance their faith nor equal their rejoicing; yet we can imitate them so far, as to look abroad into this fair world, which God made 'very good,' while we mourn over the evil which Adam brought into it; to hold communion with what we see there, while we seek Him who is invisible; to admire it, while we abstain from it; to acknowledge God's love, while we deprecate His wrath; to confess that, many as are our sins, His grace is greater. Our sins are more in number than the hairs of our head; yet even the hairs of our head are all numbered by Him. He counts our sins, and, as He counts, so can He forgive; for that reckoning, great though it be, comes to an end; but His mercies fail not, and His Son's merits are infinite.

       On March 30, 1845  Venerable John Henry Newman wrote a letter which included the following: "Now I will tell you more than any one knows except two friends. My own convictions are as strong, as I suppose they can become: only it is so difficult to know whether it is a call of  reason  or of conscience. I cannot make out, if I am impelled by what seems clear, or by a sense of  duty . You can understand how painful this doubt is; so I have waited, hoping for light, and using the words of the Psalmist, 'Show some token upon me.' But I suppose I have no right to wait for ever for this. Then I am waiting, because friends are most considerately bearing me in mind, and asking guidance for me; and, I trust, I should attend to any new feelings which came upon me, should that be the effect of their kindness. And then this waiting subserves the purpose of preparing men's minds. I dread shocking, unsettling people. Any how, I can't avoid giving incalculable pain. So, if I had my will, I should like to wait till the summer of 1846, which would be a full seven years from the time that my convictions first began to fall on me. But I don't think I shall last so long." He did not "last so long", of course.

       On March 28, 1879  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., wrote to a friend about the difficulty he was having answering all the letters of congratulations he was getting from various well-wishers who had heard that he was to be made a Cardinal.  "I am overwhelmed and wearied out with answering letters so joyful and affectionate that I should be as hard as a stone, and as cruel as an hyena, and as ungrateful as a wild cat, if I did not welcome them; but they try me much ... P.S.-Sometimes I have been at my desk from 9 A.M. to 10 P.M. with hardly any stop."

        From  Parochial and Plain Sermons     by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "Christ is risen; He is risen from the dead. We may well cry out, 'Alleluia, the Lord Omnipotent reigneth.' He has crushed all the power of the enemy under His feet. He has gone upon the lion and the adder. He has stopped the lion's mouth for us His people, and has bruised the serpent's head. There is nothing impossible to us now, if we do but enter into the fulness of our privileges, the wondrous power of our gifts. The thing cannot be named in heaven or earth within the limits of truth and obedience which we cannot do through Christ; the petition cannot be named which may not be accorded to us for His Name's sake. For, we who have risen with Him from the grave, stand in His might, and are allowed to use His weapons. His infinite influence with the Father is ours,-not always to use, for perhaps in this or that effort we make, or petition we prefer, it would not be good for us; but so far ours, so fully ours, that when we ask and do things according to His will, we are really possessed of a power with God, and do prevail:-so that little as we may know when and when not, we are continually possessed of heavenly weapons, we are continually touching the springs of the most wonderful providences in heaven and earth; and by the Name, and the Sign, and the Blood of the Son of God, we are able to make devils tremble and Saints rejoice.

       For Holy Saturday...  another chapter from  The Creed in Slow Motion  by Msgr. Ronald Knox.   urlLink Dead and Buried  Here is a selection.... "We think of the Resurrection as an extraordinary thing; but that is really the wrong way to look at it. The Resurrection was, you may say, an inevitable event, an event which anybody ought to have foreseen. The pains of death, as St. Peter says, could not hold our Lord; of course they couldn't. No, the extraordinary thing was that the pains of death should ever, even for a moment, have the power to assail Him. And yet they did. I've tried to explain to you, in one of my earlier sermons, why it was fitting that this should happen, so far as our limited intelligences can attempt to account for such a mystery. But, however much you or I may understand it or fail to understand it, there is the fact; God died. And it is a mystery which will, perhaps, make it easier for us to understand other mysteries; other mysteries which will cross the path of each of us, as life goes on. I mean, when someone for whom we care deeply is taken from us by death, and we find ourselves murmuring at the back of our minds the old complaint: 'Why was this allowed to happen?' All we know is that God hung on the Cross, with his Blessed Mother beside Him praying a Mother's prayers; and He was allowed to die. "

        From  The Creed in Slow Motion    by. Msgr. Ronald Knox :  urlLink Was Crucified  Here's a small excerpt: "What would those two men have said, if you'd told them that the cross they had just knocked together out of two planks would be dug up, three hundred years later, and that in honour of that event the punishment of crucifixion would be abolished in the Roman Empire for ever? What would they have said, if you had told them that that cross would be taken away by the Parthians, and demanded back from the Parthians by one of the articles of a peace treaty? That it would be carried into Jerusalem, in solemn procession, on the shoulders of the Emperor himself? That it would be broken up, as time went on, into little pieces, and those pieces would be treasured all over the world, in gold and silver reliquaries, exposed year by year for public adoration? That, all over the world, people would be worshipping in churches marked, inside and outside, with that cross; sacred ministers standing in front of that cross, attired in vestments marked, everywhere, with that cross, making the sign of that cross over a piece of bread marked with that cross? That school-boys and schoolgirls would see the figure of that cross in the rooms where they worked, or had their meals, or went to bed; that they would trace the lines of that cross, from forehead to breast, twenty or thirty times a day? All that was what those two men were doing when they knocked two pieces of wood together, that spring morning long ago. The instrument of punishment, used for slaves, so much held in contempt that men would say to one another, 'Oh, go and crucify yourself!' when they were bored or angry, was to shine on the crowns of kings and emperors, was to be the symbol of a religion destined to pervade the world.

       To Christ in His Passion    "Let us all with one voice cry, Lord, have mercy.  Thou who wert led as a sheep to be crucified, Lord, have mercy. Thou who from the Cross didst look down upon Thy Mother and Thy disciple, look with pity from heaven upon us,  Lord, have mercy.  Thou who by shedding Thy blood hast redeemed the world,  Lord, have mercy.  Thou who didst commend Thy spirit to the Father,  Lord, have mercy. Make us by Thy Cross to obtain forgiveness,  Lord, have mercy.  Christ, the only-begotten Son of the unbegotten Father, who this day west slain for us, the innocent for the ungodly, remember the price of Thy Blood and blot out the sins of all Thy people; and as Thou west pleased to endure for us reproaches, spitting, bonds, blows, the scourge, the Cross, the nails, the bitter cup, death, the spear, and lastly burial, vouchsafe to us wretched ones, for whom Thou didst suffer this, the infinite blessedness of the heavenly kingdom, that we who bow down in reverence for Thy Passion may be raised up to things heavenly in the joys of Thy resurrection. Amen.  " - The Mozarabic Liturgy

       From the sermon "Omnipotence in Bonds"  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "He tore open the solid rock; He rose from the tomb; He ascended on high; He is far off from the earth; He is safe from profanation; and the soul and body, which He assumed, partake of course, as far as created nature allows, of the Sovereign Freedom and the Independence of Omnipotence. It is not so: He is indeed beyond the reach of suffering; but you anticipate, my Brethren, what I have yet to say. Is He then so enamoured of the prison, that He should purpose to revisit earth again, in order that, as far as possible, He may undergo it still? Does He set such a value on subjection to His creatures, that, before He goes away, on the very eve of His betrayal, He must actually make provision, after death, for perpetuating His captivity to the end of the world? My Brethren, the great truth is daily before our eyes: He has ordained the standing miracle of His Body and Blood under visible symbols, that He may secure thereby the standing mystery of Omnipotence in bonds.  He took bread, and blessed, and made it His Body; He took wine, and gave thanks, and made it His Blood; and He gave His priests the power to do what He had done. Henceforth, He is in the hands of sinners once more. Frail, ignorant, sinful man, by the sacerdotal power given to him, compels the presence of the Highest; he lays Him up in a small tabernacle; he dispenses Him to a sinful people. Those who are only just now cleansed from mortal sin, open their lips for Him; those who are soon to return to mortal sin, receive Him into their breasts; those who are polluted with vanity and selfishness and ambition and pride, presume to make Him their guest; the frivolous, the tepid, the worldly-minded, fear not to welcome Him. Alas! alas! even those who wish to be more in earnest, entertain Him with cold and wandering thoughts, and quench that Love which would inflame them with Its own fire, did they but open to It. Such are the best of us; and then for the worst? O my Brethren, what shall we say of sacrilege? of His reception into hearts polluted with mortal, unforsaken sin? of those further nameless profanations, which from time to time occur, when unbelief dares to present itself at the Holy Altar, and blasphemously gains possession of Him?  My Brethren, it is plain that, when we confess God as Omnipotent only, we have gained but a half-knowledge of Him: His is an Omnipotence which can at the same time swathe Itself in infirmity and can become the captive of Its own creatures. He has, if I may so speak, the incomprehensible power of even making Himself weak. We must know Him by His names, Emmanuel and Jesus, to know Him perfectly. "

       A quote...  from Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., dealing with part of today's Gospel reading: "Judas, having once shown what he was, lost no time in carrying out his malice. He went to the Chief Priests, and bargained with them to betray his Lord for a price. Our Lord saw all that took place within him; He saw Satan knocking at his heart, and admitted there and made an honoured and beloved guest and an intimate. He saw him go to the Priests and heard the conversation between them. He had seen it by His foreknowledge all the time he had been about Him, and when He chose him. What we know feebly as to be, affects us far more vividly and very differently when it actually takes place. Our Lord had at length felt, and suffered Himself to feel, the cruelty of the ingratitude of which He was the sport and victim. He had treated Judas as one of His most familiar friends. He had shown marks of the closest intimacy; He had made him the purse-keeper of Himself and His followers. He had given him the power of working miracles. He had admitted him to a knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. He had sent him out to preach and made him one of His own special representatives, so that the Master was judged of by the conduct of His servant. A heathen, when smitten by a friend, said, "Et tu Brut&euml;!" What desolation is in the sense of ingratitude! God who is met with ingratitude daily cannot from His Nature feel it. He took a human heart, that He might feel it in its fulness. And now, O my God, though in heaven, dost Thou not feel my ingratitude towards Thee? " -  Meditations and Devotions

       On this date in 1999  I became a member of the Secular Oratory. In honor of this, I post the following prayer. "O dear and holy Patron, Philip, I put myself into thy hands, and for the love of Jesus, for that loves sake which chose thee and made thee a saint, I implore thee to pray for me, that, as He has brought thee to heaven, so in due time He may take me to heaven also.  Thou art my glorious protector, and, after Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, canst do most for me in life and death. In thy labours thou didst follow thy Lord and Saviour, and in thy hidden life and hidden virtues, in thy purity, humility, and fervour, art nearest to Mary and Joseph of all saints. I have long dedicated myself to thee, but I have done nothing worthy of thee, and I am ashamed to call myself thine, because thou hast a right to have followers of great innocence, great honesty of purpose, and great resolution, and these virtues I have not.  Thou, Philip, hast no anxiety about thyself, for thou art already in heaven, therefore thou canst afford to have a care for me. Watch over me, keep me from lagging behind, gain for me the grace necessary to keep me up to my duty, so that I may make progress in all virtues, in the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity; in the four cardinal virtues of prudence, fortitude, justice, temperance; moreover in humility, in chastity, in liberality, in meekness, and in truthfulness.  Director of souls, Patron of thine own, who didst turn so many hearts to God, pray for   me."- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Meditations and Devotions

       A quote...  dealing with today's Gospel, from Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "An evil temper of murmuring and criticism is spread among the disciples. One was the source of it, but it seems to have been spread. The thought of His death was before Him, and He was thinking of it and His burial after it. A woman came and anointed His sacred head. The action spread a soothing tender feeling over His pure soul. It was a mute token of sympathy, and the whole house was filled with it. It was rudely broken by the harsh voice of the traitor now for the first time giving utterance to his secret heartlessness and malice.  Ut quid perditio hæc?  "To what purpose is this waste?"-the unjust steward with his impious economy making up for his own private thefts by grudging honour to his Master. Thus in the midst of the sweet calm harmony of that feast at Bethany, there comes a jar and discord; all is wrong: sour discontent and distrust are spreading, for the devil is abroad.

       On Palm Sunday, 1857...  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  Falling Away   "1. INTROD.Too awful a subject commonly, as leading [men] to despond; yet useful sometimes, and natural at this season.  2. Now first let us lay down about nature and grace[that] nature can do many things, but cannot bring to heaven. Grace is like a new nature, and joins us to the heavenly family; and they are saved who die with this grace; those lost who are without it.  3. This answers the question: Will good departed from avail? As some Protestants say, 'Look how a man lives, not how he dies'(explain).  4. Proof, Ezech. xviii. [24]. And rightly, for the sovereign Lord of heaven can prescribe His terms.  5. Now this chapter leads to a further thought, viz. that much as is said to encourage repentance, as much perhaps is said to warn against falling, as if the prospect, or chance, or issue on the whole were equal.  6.  E.g.   our Lord, 'I came not to call.' But on the other hand, recollect the number of passages such as 'Two shall be in the field'; 'Ten virgins'; 'He that persevereth,' etc.; 'Many that are first,' etc.  7. So St. Paul, preacher of repentance: but Heb. vi. [4-6] .  8. So holy Simeon, 'This child [for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel,' Luke ii. 34].  9. This text of holy Simeon especially fulfilled at Passion, when two special examples.  10. Multitude on Palm Sunday,  vide  their being in grace [implied] in the prayers [second and last] in the Blessing of Palms. Cp. our Lord's weeping-disappointment of the foolish virgins.  11. Judas. Our Lord chose him when he was in grace-trace about him-'the ten indignant,' Mark x. 32, etc.  12. Some fall away at one age, some at another. Go through this.  13. On natural habits produced by supernatural acts deceiving the old.  14. Our Lady. Prayerpray  lest  we fall, if we fall, and for others. "

       From the homily  Fr. Michael was the celebrant at Mass this morning. In his homily, he mentioned that the Passion of Our Lord has an unusal prominence in the world at large, due to the spectacular success of a certain film. The statement I remember best was his remark that those who criticized the film for focusing too much on Christ's sufferings and not enough on His teaching have a 'backwards' understanding of Our Lord. "Christ's life cannot be understood except through the Cross. "

If to him that hath, more is given, and holiness and Divine favour go together (and this we are expressly told), what must have been the transcendent purity of her, whom the Creator Spirit condescended to overshadow with His miraculous presence? What must have been her gifts, who was chosen to be the only near earthly relative of the Son of God, the only one whom He was bound by nature to revere and look up to; the one appointed to train and educate Him, to instruct Him day by day, as He grew in wisdom and in stature?"- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Parochial and Plain Sermons

"Today I have been honoured with a visit from Cardinal Newman, and never did he look more venerable, and show more feeling. He had fixed his mind all Lent to come and see me on Easter Monday. When that day came he was forbidden to leave the house. Today was bright, and he came; he was brought to my room leaning on the arms of two priests, and we talked for an hour, after which he left. He can no longer read, and even if he tries to sign his name he cannot see what strokes he makes. But I was much touched by his conversation."

        From  Parochial and Plain Sermons     by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Glorious, indeed, will be the spring time of the Resurrection, when all that seemed dry and withered will bud forth and blossom. The glory of Lebanon will be given it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon; the fir tree for the thorn, the myrtle tree for the briar; and the mountains and the hills shall break forth before us in singing. Who would miss being of that company? Wretched men they will then appear, who now for a season enjoy the pleasures of sin. Wretched, who follow their own selfish will, instead of walking by faith, who are now idle, instead of trying to serve God, who are set upon the world's vanities, or who scoff at religion, or who allow themselves in known sin, who live in anger, or malice, or pride, or covetousness, who do not continually strive to become better and holier, who are afraid to profess themselves Christians and take up their cross and follow Christ. May the good Lord make us all willing to follow Him! may He rouse the slumberers, and raise them to a new life here, that they may inherit His eternal kingdom hereafter! "

       From the homily  Fr. Michael was the celebrant at noon Mass today. Since the Gospel today dealt with an appearance of the Risen Christ to the Apostles,in his homily he went over the four properties of the risen Body of Christ- that it is now impassible (not able to suffer), agile (able to move with extreme rapidity and grace), subtle (able to pass all barriers- i.e. to go through walls) and clear (shining with the radiance of His perfect human Soul). He commented that while the skeptical, cynical world would dismiss this as a 'fairytale', it tries to give its own pale and false images of glory in the celebrities and such that it hold up for imitation. However, true glory comes through obedience. The Risen Christ bears the marks of the nails.

       From  Meditations and Devotions    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "My Lord Jesus, how wonderful were those conversations which Thou didst hold from time to time with Thy disciples after Thy resurrection. When Thou wentest with two of them to Emmaus, Thou didst explain all the prophecies which related to Thyself. And Thou didst commit to the Apostles the Sacraments in fulness, and the truths which it was Thy will to reveal, and the principles and maxims by which Thy Church was to be maintained and governed. And thus Thou didst prepare them against the day of Pentecost (as the risen bodies were put into shape for the Spirit in the Prophet's Vision), when life and illumination was to be infused into them. I will think over all Thou didst say to them with a true and simple faith. The 'kingdom of God' was Thy sacred subject. Let me never for an instant forget that Thou hast established on earth a kingdom of Thy own, that the Church is Thy work, Thy establishment, Thy instrument; that we are under Thy rule, Thy laws and Thy eye-that when the Church speaks Thou dost speak. Let not familiarity with this wonderful truth lead me to be insensible to it-let not the weakness of Thy human representatives lead me to forget that it is Thou who dost speak and act through them. It was just when Thou wast going away, that then Thou didst leave this kingdom of Thine to take Thy place on to the end of the world, to speak for Thee, as Thy visible form, when Thy Personal Presence, sensible to man, was departing. I will in true loving faith bring Thee before me, teaching all the truths and laws of this kingdom to Thy Apostles, and I will adore Thee, while in my thoughts I gaze upon Thee and listen to Thy words.

       On April 13, 1869  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., wrote the following letter to the Rev. John Hayes, who had inquired about his writing style.   "My dear Sir,I saw the article you speak of in the 'Times,' and felt flattered by the passage which referred to myself.  The writer must have alluded in the sentence which leads to your question to my 'Lectures and Essays on University Subjects,' which is at present out of print. In that volume there are several papers on English and Latin composition.  It is simply the fact that I have been obliged to take great pains with every thing I have written, and I often write chapters over and over again, besides innumerable corrections and interlinear additions. I am not stating this as a merit, only that some persons write their best first, and I very seldom do. Those who are good speakers may be supposed to be able to write off what they want to say. I, who am not a good speaker, have to correct laboriously what I put on paper. I have heard that Archbishop Howley, who was an elegant writer, betrayed the labour by which he became so by his mode of speaking, which was most painful to hear from his hesitations and alterations-that is, he was correcting his composition as he went along.  However, I may truly say that I never have been in the practice since I was a boy of attempting to write well, or to form an elegant style. I think I never have written for writing sake: but my one and single desire and aim has been to do what is so difficult-viz. to express clearly and exactly my meaning; this has been the motive principle of all my corrections and re-writings. When I have read over a passage which I had written a few days before, I have found it so obscure to myself that I have either put it altogether aside or fiercely corrected it; but I dont get any better for practice. I am as much obliged to correct and re-write as I was thirty years ago.  As to patterns for imitation, the only master of style I have ever had (which is strange considering the differences of the languages) is Cicero. I think I owe a great deal to him, and as far as I know to no one else. His great mastery of Latin is shown especially in his clearness. Very faithfully yours, JOHN H. NEWMAN.

       From the Professor's pen....  "I would venture to say that approaching the Christian Story from this direction, it has long been my feeling (a joyous feeling) that God redeemed the corrupt making-creatures, men, in a way fitting to this aspect, as to others, of their strange nature. The Gospels contain a fairy-story, or a story of a larger kind which embraces all the essence of fairy-stories. They contain many marvelspeculiarly artistic, beautiful, and moving: 'mythical' in their perfect, self-contained significance; and among the marvels is the greatest and most complete conceivable eucatastrophe. But this story has entered History and the primary world; the desire and aspiration of sub-creation has been raised to the fulfillment of Creation. The Birth of Christ is the eucatastrophe of Man's history. The Resurrection is the eucatastrophe of the story of the Incarnation. This story begins and ends in joy. It has pre-eminently the 'inner consistency of reality.' There is no tale ever told that men would rather find was true, and none which so many sceptical men have accepted as true on its own merits. For the Art of it has the supremely convincing tone of Primary Art, that is, of Creation. To reject it leads either to sadness or to wrath.  It is not difficult to imagine the peculiar excitement and joy that one would feel, if any specially beautiful fairy-story were found to be 'primarily' true, its narrative to be history, without thereby necessarily losing the mythical or allegorical significance that it had possessed. It is not difficult, for one is not called upon to try and conceive anything of a quality unknown. The joy would have exactly the same quality, if not the same degree, as the joy which the 'turn' in a fairy-story gives: such joy has the very taste of primary truth. (Otherwise its name would not be joy.) It looks forward (or backward: the direction in this regard is unimportant) to the Great Eucatastrophe. The Christian joy, the  Gloria , is of the same kind; but it is preeminently (infinitely, if our capacity were not finite) high and joyous. But this story is supreme; and it is true. Art has been verified. God is the Lord, of angels, and of menand of elves. Legend and History have met and fused.  But in God's kingdom the presence of the greatest does not depress the small. Redeemed Man is still man. Story, fantasy, still go on, and should go on. The  Evangelium  has not abrogated legends; it has hallowed them, especially the 'happy ending.' The Christian has still to work, with mind as well as body, to suffer, hope, and die; but he may now perceive that all his bents and faculties have a purpose, which can be redeemed. So great is the bounty with which he has been treated that he may now, perhaps, fairly dare to guess that in Fantasy he may actually assist in the effoliation and multiple enrichment of creation. All tales may come true; and yet, at the last, redeemed, they may be as like and as unlike the forms that we give them as Man, finally redeemed, will be like and unlike the fallen that we know.

       For Saturday  " He says, 'More blessed is it to do God's will than to be God's Mother.' Do not say that Catholics do not feel this deeply-so deeply do they feel it that they are ever enlarging on her virginity, purity, immaculateness, faith, humility and obedience. Never say then that Catholics forget this passage of Scripture. Whenever they keep the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the Purity, or the like, recollect it is because they make so much of the blessedness of sanctity. The woman in the crowd cried out, 'Blessed is the womb and the breasts of Mary.' She spoke in faith; she did not mean to exclude her higher blessedness, but her words only went a certain way. Therefore our Lord completed them. And therefore His Church after Him, dwelling on the great and sacred mystery of His Incarnation, has ever felt that she, who so immediately ministered to it, must have been most holy. And therefore for the honour of the Son she has ever extolled the glory of the Mother. As we give Him of our best, ascribe to Him what is best, as on earth we make our churches costly and beautiful; as when He was taken down from the cross, His pious servants wrapped Him in fine linen, and laid Him in a tomb in which never man was laid; as His dwelling place in heaven is pure and stainless-so much more ought to be-so much more was-that tabernacle from which He took flesh, in which He lay, holy and immaculate and divine. As a body was prepared for Him, so was the place of that body prepared also. Before the Blessed Mary could be Mother of God, and in order to her being Mother, she was set apart, sanctified, filled with grace, and made meet for the presence of the Eternal." - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O,  Faith and Prejudice

       In 1851  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon at St. Ann's, Leeds,at the reception into the Church of the Rev. Richard Ward, late Vicar of St. Saviour's, Leeds; the Rev. Thomas Minster, late Vicar of St. Saviours; the Rev. J. C. L. Crawley, S. Rooke, and Coombes, all Curates of St. Saviour's; the Rev. W. H. Lewthwaite, Incumbent of Clifford, near Tadcaster; the Rev. W. Neville, Manager of St. Saviour's Orphanage; and fourteen lay persons. ( The reception of most of the ministerial staff of St. Saviour's into the Catholic Church caused a bit of a stir, especially because St. Saviour's had been built by the Venerable's friend Pusey.)  While he did not write it down, someone was apparently taking extensive notes.....  "Addressing those present as dear friends and brethren, Fr. Newman said this was no time for putting into order any thoughts which might be in his mind; nor, indeed, was it necessary, nor would they wish it. What they wished rather was that he should speak out of the fulness of his heart and there leave the matter. Because what was it that they who had that day been brought into the Catholic Church had received? They had received day for night, light for twilight, peace for warfare. There was not a change so great as that which took place from the state of doubt and confusion and misery in which the soul was, external to the Catholic Church, to that peace which it found when it came into it. They knew it was said there is a silence which can be heard, which can be felt. Anyone who had been at sea, and who had for days and nights heard the billows beating at the sides of the vessel, and then came into port, knew what a strange stillness it was when the continued noise of the billows had ceased. When a bell stopped there was a kind of fulness of silence which was most grateful from the contrast. So it was in comparing the tumult and irritation of mind, which they felt in their long seeking for peace, with the joy experienced when they had found it. It was the rich reward of their long anxieties. Those who did not care whether they were right or wrong, those who thought they were right, those who had a dead conscience-they had no anxiety; but it was when a ray of light came, it was when a wounded conscience stung them, it was when they had a misgiving that they were where they should not be-it was then that the warfare began. They had a feeling of duty and wished to do that duty, but they did not know where it lay. Sometimes they thought it lay this way, sometimes that way; and then the voices of friends came and over-persuaded them, and they were driven back; so that one way and another they were in a most miserable condition. It was partly, certainly, their own fault. It was the fault of all of them, doubtless, who had been external to the Catholic Church, that they did not enter it sooner, because if they had had a fuller determination to follow God's will doubtless they would have found it sooner. But Almighty God knew what they were made of, and He mercifully led them on by first one grace and then another, till they were brought nearer and nearer to that haven where they would be. But though they might be getting nearer they did not know where they stood. Others might see they were getting nearer, but to themselves they seemed to be drifted about, tossed up and down by the waves, and there seemed no hope. It often happened that when persons were near the shore they were amongst billows more alarming and more dangerous, because Satan blew the billows more fiercely in order to drown those who were near safety; and they knew that frequently in cases of shipwreck when those who fell into the water were endeavouring to reach the land something happened to carry them off. So it was in like manner that poor souls who were making towards that land where they wished to be might be seen going on gradually and gradually towards the shore, and it might be prophesied-humbly, but still prophesied-that they would be landed safe, and alas! when they were about to land, suddenly they drifted off; they perished, and it was not known what became of them. It was only known that they were not landed on the beach of the Catholic Church. But the Catholics present had all cause for rejoicing that to those to whom God's mercy had been shown that day it had not so happened. They had put themselves into God's hands, and God had brought them into that haven which they had sought. And now on this day they thanked God, as they well might, that He had, in His grace, received them safe. He had brought them within the fold of His Church, He had encompassed them with His everlasting armour, had shielded them from the enemy, and he trusted that they had now got a gift they would never lose; that they were now in a state from which they would never fall, and, through God's mercy, having long sought, having at last found, they would go on from strength to strength, grace to grace, doing more and more in His service, and whatever might be their trials, still they would persevere to the end, and die in the Faith, and so would be brought, through the blood and merits of Jesus Christ, to the land of glory in eternity. What a time was this, that such a thing should take place in it! What did they see? They saw the evil spirit stirred up from the four winds. They saw he was blowing from the four quarters of Heaven upon this land, to make the waves of the people rise against the Catholic Church. They might say, 'This is not the time for the Catholic Church to triumph.' But it was the time. Man's necessity was God's opportunity. The darker the day was, the brighter God's light came. Did they not know it was the property of the truth of God to advance against wind and tide in the most rapid way? It advanced against all the billows because it was divine-it was supernatural. That was the property of the truth of God, and, therefore, just at this season, when men were most furious against them, when they told all manner of lies and falsehoods against them-because Christ was with them when men were so inflamed against them, it was the very time for them to expect triumphs. The world could not conquer: it was impossible. No, they would see, as time went on, that all those things which now looked so black and unpromising would turn to the glory and the salvation of the Catholic Church. If men were called to do that which he did not think they meant to do-persecute the Catholics-it would not hurt them. Did they not know, in the three first centuries of Christianity, that the martyrs went through so much for Christianity that it was said the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the Church? So was it now. Supposing men were mad enough to inflict chains and imprisonment upon them, it would only increase the spread of truth. Of course, it was unpleasant to live in the continued anxiety which all this tumult amid opposition created. Catholics did not like to be taken from their usual occupations. Catholics did not like to be taken from their usual religious ceremonies. Bishops did not like to be taken from their flocks. They wished for peace. They wished for peace for the good of the world and for the good of their flocks internally. But would this state of warfare diminish the Church? No; it would increase it. Not a day passed but souls were received into the heart of the Catholic Church. Sometimes they might be high, sometimes they might be low, but the work could not be stopped. They recollected what Gamaliel said in the days of the Apostles. He said if the work was of man it would come to naught, but if it was of God it would go on, and they must take care they did not fight against it. So was it now. Here they were in the nineteenth century after Christ came into the world, and yet what was said by Gamaliel, 1,800 years ago, was fulfilled now. If this work was of man it would fall to naught. How was it that this work had gone on for 1,800 years, and now seemed more strong and flourishing for all the opposition which had existed against it? How was it that the Protestants were in such perplexity? Why, they had seen the Holy Father the Pope driven from Rome and obliged to take refuge elsewhere; they had seen him persecuted by his own people, and had said, 'Here is a poor creature; he can do nothing.'Catholics took them at their word. It was true the Pope was not strong in this world, and yet was strong; he suspected his strength must come, not from this, but from some other world, and he suspected it was from the throne of God. The words of Gamaliel were fulfilled. If the work was of man it would come to naught. It had not come to naught, and therefore it was not of man, but of God. He looked upon the converts present as specimens of this great miracle which is going on continually, this miracle of conversion of souls in spite of the opposition of the world. Every soul that was converted to God was converted by a miracle: it was a supernatural work which no power of man could do. It was a work of grace. It could not be worldly inducements which brought men into the Catholic Church, since they gained no riches, no honours, no praise from the mouths of men; but, on the contrary, they were reviled and called names. They gained nothing of this world. It was nothing, then, but a supernatural might which brought them in: it was nothing but the grace of God, seeing those things which the world could not see, and having a desire after those things which the world could not desire. That was the great distinction between the Catholic Church and every other body. Every other body depended upon the world. Take away its worldly support and it goes. There was no Protestant who would not grant, when he came to think, that the Church of England, for instance, would go to pieces directly the temporal support was taken away. It was impossible that it could stand. Protestants knew that very well. All the most sagacious knew it well. He recollected perfectly well, several years ago, a person in authority in the Church of England gave out a charge. What did he say? 'The State is a very bad mistress, but we must put ourselves under its protection, and surrender ourselves to it, because we cannot get a better. It was once thought reason and intellect would help the Protestants against the Catholics; but we find it is not so. We find the cleverest men become Catholics. It was said that learning, talent, and genius would leave the Catholics, but it was not so. Light, learning, talent, and genius, all go towards the Catholic Church. Well, then nothing is left to us. Let us cling to the State because we cannot do anything better. Our only hope is a worldly hope; our only hope is in the arm of flesh, because we can find nothing better.'Of course, those were not the very words, but the sentiment was nowise exaggerated. It was an honest and true sentiment, though it was very plain to come from a member of the Church of England. It was certain, if the protection of the State were taken from the Church of England it would crumble to pieces. Nothing would be left. It had no unity, no stability, no solidity, no existence, but in the power of the State. How different was the Catholic Church. The State did all it could against it, but it could not destroy it. Here was the State doing all it could against the Catholic Church, and yet the Catholic Church was growing in influence in the country. In spite of the State's having done so much for the Church of England, and so much against the Catholic Church, still, when this poor old man, whom they professed to despise, living two thousand miles off, put out a bit of paper naming certain Bishops of England, the Church of England could not bear the shadow of his hand going over the country. He wrote a few words, the shadow of his hand went over the country, and the whole country was in commotion. The true Vicar of Christ, two thousand miles distant, put into confusion this great country. Could there be a better triumph for all of them than this fact? Their enemies and the inhabitants of their country (part were not their enemies) could not bear the very whisper of the Vicar of Christ in relation to this country; and in spite of all the greatness of the Church of England, they saw it was merely worldly, while the Catholic Church, not standing upon worldly power, rose up by an unseen power, a power which every arm of flesh feared. The State Church feared it, because it knew that it was of earth, and that the Church of God came from Heaven. It was to the preacher an affecting thing that he should be there on that occasion, speaking to them, because whom was it they had received into the Catholic Church that day? Why, it was the first of a portion of a special congregation of the Church of England, of a district or parish of the Church of England, which was created under remarkable circumstances-to him especially so. They knew he was not always a Catholic. It was some years ago the grace of God made him a Catholic, and on the very day of his conversion what was taking place in this town? Why, the very day when he was being led, as he trusted and believed by the grace of God, to embrace the Faith of the Church of Christ-that was the very time the Church of St. Saviour was opened. It was opened, if he recollected rightly, with a long devotional service which lasted many days, and when that was taking place here he was being received into the Catholic Church 150 miles away. Therefore it was to him a circumstance of especial interest just at this moment, now he was thrown back to the period of his own conversion, to see in the event of this day a sort of reward of what God led him to do then, that he had been the instrument in part of doing what had been done now. How or when it was that those favoured souls who had that day been made members of the Catholic Church were led by the grace of God towards the Catholic Church, he knew not; but as regarded himself, he felt that they had wished him to come as a kind of witness to receive them, because there was this remarkable connexion between St. Saviour's Church being opened and his own conversion. Then it was that that was begun which now had its end, and they saw in this another illustration of the want of stability of everything in the Church of England. There had been a church-he meant St. Saviour's-opened with how much of pious feeling, with how many sincere aspirations, with how many ready offerings to Almighty God What sums of money had been expended upon that church. It had been the work of persons who in their hearts believed, in doing what they did, they were making an offering, not to the work of man, but to the Catholic church. They were mistaken in thinking so, but they brought their offerings. They did not act with a half liberality, but, bringing treasure by handfuls, they gave it for the erection of a church which they hoped would be a Catholic church. They adorned it, enriched it, and what had become of all those hopes which began six years ago? Why, had they not vanished into empty air? They saw that the church which they built had turned out to be nothing at all; and after a trial of six years there was that remarkable truth which came to him six years ago, that the Church of England was a mere shade, that it had no substance. Here was this trial which they saw had come to naught. There were piety, devotion, sincerity, earnestness?persons who would devote themselves earnestly to God; but alas! they built up the mere creation of this world, which would not last. It was coming to naught, and what had been the case here would be the case all over in the Church of England but for the power of the State. It was the power of the State which alone kept anything in its place in the Church of England. Not so with the Catholic Church. Merely sitting still, ordering its own work silently, it had attracted educated members of the Church of England to it. It was a burning and a shining light, and it preached to the people directly by its example. After some further observations, Dr. Newman begged the prayers of the Catholics present for those who had been received into the Church on that day and some days previously. He begged their prayers that the work begun might go on spreading and increasing daily, till all those were brought into the fold of Christ that ought to belong to it?that all those to whom God had given grace might have the veil taken from their eyes. He asked their prayers also-for prayer was omnipotentthat all those who had anything to do with the erection of St. Saviour's Church might be brought to the light of truth. They could not undo what they had done. St. Saviour's Church, so called, was given up to the Protestants, and there was an end of it. They had given it over to the State. They could not undo their own work; but it would be a great thing for all of them, while they felt that they could not undo much that they had done, that at least they could save their own souls, and show their earnestness by retracing their steps as far as they could. He begged them to pray that every one of the earnest persons who preached sermons at the opening of St. Saviour's Church might be brought into the fold of Christ; that all those who had hung upon their words might be brought fully to the truth; that those who, to some extent, had been nursing fathers to the Catholic Church, though they knew it not, might be brought in; and that every one who had been instrumental in the spread of Catholic doctrines in England, though they knew it not, might be brought into the Catholic Church. Finally, Dr. Newman asked his Catholic hearers to pray for himself that he might be enabled to do his share in the work which had been begun."  William Neville, who was one of those received that day, eventually became  urlLink Fr. William Neville, C.O.,   of the Birmingham Oratory. When those fingers that had written so many books and articles, plus literally thousands of letters, became too stiff to hold a pen, it was Fr. Neville who wrote letters from the Venerable's dictation- though Newman insisted on at least scrawling out his initials as a signature on his letters for as long as possible.

       From  Loss and Gain   The first of the  urlLink two   urlLink novels  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  In this scene, the main character (Charles Reding) receives some news from a close friend (and fellow Oxford undergraduate), which shows a bit of the type of reaction someone who converted to Catholicism in 19th England could expect.....  "Charles had to pass a day or two at the house of a relative who lived a little way out of London. While he was there a letter arrived for him, forwarded from home; it was from Willis, dated from London, and announced that he had come to a very important decision, and should not return to Oxford. Charles was fairly in the world again, plunged into the whirl of opinions: how sad a contrast to his tranquil home! There was no mistaking what the letter meant; and he set out at once with the chance of finding the writer at the house from which he dated it. It was a lodging at the west-end of the town; and he reached it about noon.  He found Willis in company with a person apparently two or three years older. Willis started on seeing him.  'Who would have thought! what brings you here?'he said; 'I thought you were in the country.' Then to his companion, 'This is the friend I was speaking to you about, Morley. A happy meeting; sit down, dear Reding; I have much to tell you.'  Charles sat down, all suspense, looking at Willis with such keen anxiety that the latter was forced to cut the matter short. 'Reding, I am a Catholic.'  Charles threw himself back in his chair, and turned pale.  'My dear Reding, what is the matter with you? why don't you speak to me?'  Charles was still silent; at last, stooping forward, with his elbows on his knees, and his head on his hands, he said, in a low voice, 'Oh, Willis, what have you done?'  'Done?' said Willis; 'what  you  should do, and half Oxford besides. Oh, Reding, I'm so happy!'  'Alas, alas!' said Charles; 'but what is the good of my staying?-all good attend you, Willis; good-bye!'  'No, my good Reding, you don't leave me so soon, having found me so unexpectedly; and you have had a long walk, I dare say; sit down, there's a good fellow; we shall have luncheon soon, and you must not go without taking your part in it.' He took Charles's hat from him as he spoke; and Charles, in a mixture of feelings, let him have his way.  'Oh, Willis, so you have separated yourself from us for ever!' he said; 'you have taken your course, we keep ours: our paths are different.'  'Not so,' said Willis; 'you must follow me, and we shall be one still.'  Charles was half offended. 'Really I must go,' he said, and he rose; 'you must not talk in that manner.'  'Pray, forgive me,' answered Willis; 'I won't do so again; but I could not help it; I am not in a common state, I'm so happy!'  A thought struck Reding. 'Tell me, Willis,' he said, 'your exact position; in what sense are you a Catholic? What is to prevent your returning with me to Oxford?'  His companion interposed: 'I am taking a liberty, perhaps,' he said; 'but Mr. Willis has been regularly received into the Catholic Church.'  'I have not introduced you,' said Willis. 'Reding, let me introduce Mr. Morley; Morley, Mr. Reding. Yes, Reding, I owe it to him that I am a Catholic. I have been on a tour with him abroad. We met with a good priest in France, who consented to receive my abjuration.'  'Well, I think he might profitably have examined into your state of mind a little before he did so," said Reding; 'you are not the person to become a Catholic, Willis.'  'What do you mean?'  'Because,' answered Reding, 'you are more of a Dissenter than a Catholic. I beg your pardon,' he added, seeing Willis look up sharply, 'let me be frank with you, pray do. You were attached to the Church of Rome, not as a child to a mother, but in a wayward, roving way, as a matter of fancy or liking, or (excuse me) as a greedy boy to something nice; and you pursued your object by disobeying the authorities set over you.'  It was as much as Willis could bear; he said he thought he recollected a text about 'obeying God rather than men'.  'I see you have disobeyed men,' retorted Charles; 'I trust you have been obeying God.' "

       On April 21, 1864  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., published the first part of his masterpiece,  urlLink Apologia Pro Vita Sua.  It was published in weekly installments, and was written both at great speed and in long stretches. For example, when he was writing Part Three, he wrote for sixteen hours straight, and he noted in his diary that when he was writing Part Five he was once 'At my "Apologia" for 22 hours running.'  No wonder that he sent this note along with one of his proofs:  'Excuse my penmanship. My fingers have been walking nearly twenty miles a day.'

       The April  First Things   is now  urlLink online.  There is a lot of great stuff in there, but possibly my favorite is  urlLink this one   by Fr. Richard John Neuhaus, especially the final sentence. And then there's this short bit of commentary, also by Fr. Neuhaus. "Forget about the slander that it is anti-Semitic. It appears that the problem with Mel Gibsons film on the passion is that its too pro-Christian. The Rev. Paul Rutger, director of the Council of Religious Leaders in Chicago , saw an advance screening and said, 'Personally, I have mixed feelings about the movie. Its clearly a message movie. And the message is "I believe in Jesus as the Son of God." Its straight-out evangelical, Jesus-died-for-your-sins.' Aha. So thats what Gibsons up to. Clearly, the film should be accompanied by an advisory giving fair warning to the Christianly challenged."

        From  Parochial and Plain Sermons   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "Consider for an instant. Let every one who hears me ask himself the question, what stake has  he  in the truth of Christ's promise? How would he be a whit the worse off, supposing (which is impossible), but, supposing it to fail? We know what it is to have a stake in any venture of this world. We venture our property in plans which promise a return; in plans which we trust, which we have faith in. What have we ventured for Christ? What have we given to Him on a belief of His promise? The Apostle said, that he and his brethren would be of all men most miserable, if the dead were not raised. Can we in any degree apply this to ourselves? We think, perhaps, at present, we have some hope of heaven; well,  this  we should lose of course; but after all, how should we be worse off as to our  present  condition? A trader, who has embarked some property in a speculation which fails, not only loses his prospect of gain, but somewhat of his own, which he ventured with the  hope  of the gain. This is the question, What have  we  ventured? I really fear, when we come to examine, it will be found that there is nothing we resolve, nothing we do, nothing we do not do, nothing we avoid, nothing we choose, nothing we give up, nothing we pursue, which we should not resolve, and do, and not do, and avoid, and choose, and give up, and pursue, if Christ had not died, and heaven were not promised us. I really fear that most men called Christians, whatever they may profess, whatever they may think they feel, whatever warmth and illumination and love they may claim as their own, yet would go on almost as they do, neither much better nor much worse, if they believed Christianity to be a fable. When young, they indulge their lusts, or at least pursue the world's vanities; as time goes on, they get into a fair way of business, or other mode of making money; then they marry and settle; and their interest coinciding with their duty, they seem to be, and think themselves, respectable and religious men; they grow attached to things as they are; they begin to have a zeal against vice and error; and they follow after peace with all men. Such conduct indeed, as far as it goes, is right and praiseworthy. Only I say, it has not necessarily any thing to do with religion at all; there is nothing in it which is any proof of the presence of religious principle in those who adopt it; there is nothing they would not do still, though they had nothing to gain from it, except what they gain from it now: they do gain something now, they do gratify their present wishes, they are quiet and orderly, because it is their interest and taste to be so; but they  venture  nothing, they risk, they sacrifice, they abandon nothing on the faith of Christ's word.  For instance: St. Barnabas had a property in Cyprus; he gave it up for the poor of Christ. Here is an intelligible sacrifice. He did something he would not have done, unless the Gospel were true. It is plain, if the Gospel turned out a fable (which God forbid), but if so, he would have taken his line most unskilfully; he would be in a great mistake, and would have suffered a loss. He would be like a merchant whose vessels were wrecked, or whose correspondents had failed. Man has confidence in man, he trusts to the credit of his neighbour; but Christians do not risk largely upon their Saviour's word; and this is the one thing they have to do. Christ tells us Himself, 'Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations;' [Luke xvi. 9.] i.e. buy an interest in the next world with that wealth which this world uses unrighteously; feed the hungry, clothe the naked, relieve the sick, and it shall turn to 'bags that wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not.' [Luke xii. 33.] Thus almsdeeds, I say, are an intelligible  venture  and an evidence of faith.  So again the man who, when his prospects in the world are good, gives up the promise of wealth or of eminence, in order to be nearer Christ, to have a place in His temple, to have more opportunity for prayer and praise, he makes a sacrifice.  Or he who, from a noble striving after perfection, puts off the desire of worldly comforts, and is, like Daniel or St. Paul, in much labour and business, yet with a solitary heart, he too ventures something upon the certainty of the world to come.  Or he who, after falling into sin, repents in deed as well as in word; puts some yoke upon his shoulder; subjects himself to punishment; is severe upon his flesh; denies himself innocent pleasures; or puts himself to public shame,-he too shows that his faith is the realizing of things hoped for, the warrant of things not seen.  Or again: he who only gets himself to pray against those things which the many seek after, and to embrace what the heart naturally shrinks from; he who, when God's will seems to tend towards worldly ill, while he deprecates it, yet prevails on himself to say heartily, 'Thy will be done;' he, even, is not without his sacrifice. Or he who, being in prospect of wealth, honestly prays God that he may never be rich; or he who is in prospect of station, and earnestly prays that he may never have it; or he who has friends or kindred, and acquiesces with an entire heart in their removal while it is yet doubtful, who can say, 'Take them away, if it be Thy will, to Thee I give them up, to Thee I commit them,' who is willing to be taken at his word; he too risks somewhat, and is accepted.

       Over at Christendom Awake   There's an  urlLink article  by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger. It's not easy reading, but I particularly liked the first paragraph.... "In Wladimir Solowjew's  History of the Antichrist , the eschatological enemy of the Redeemer recommended himself to believers, among other things, by the fact that he had earned his doctorate in theology at Tübingen and had written an exegetical work which was recognized as pioneering in the field. The Antichrist, a famous exegete! With this paradox Solowjew sought to shed light on the ambivalence inherent in biblical exegetical methodology for almost a hundred years now....."

       From  Discourses to Mixed Congregations   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "When our Lord gave to the Apostles their commission to preach all over the world, He continued, 'He that believeth and is baptised, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be condemned'. And He declared to Nicodemus, 'He that believeth in the Son, is not judged; but he that doth not believe is already judged, because he believeth not in the Name of the Only-begotten Son of God'. He said to the Pharisees, 'If you believe not that I am He, ye shall die in your sins'. To the Jews, 'Ye believe not, because ye are not of My sheep'. And you may recollect that before His miracles, He commonly demands faith of the supplicant: 'All things are possible,' He says, 'to him that believeth'; and we find in one place, 'He could not do any miracle,' on account of the unbelief of the inhabitants.  Has faith changed its meaning, or is it less necessary now? Is it not still what it was in the Apostles' day, the very characteristic of Christianity, the special instrument of renovation, the first disposition for justification, one out of the three theological virtues? God might have renewed us by other means, by sight, by reason, by love, but He has chosen to 'purify our hearts by faith'; it has been His will to select an instrument which the world despises, but which is of immense power. He preferred it, in His infinite wisdom, to every other; and if men have it not, they have not the very element and rudiment, out of which are formed, on which are built, the Saints and Servants of God. And they have it not; they are living, they are dying, without the hopes, without the aids of the Gospel, because, in spite of so much that is good in them, in spite of their sense of duty, their tenderness of conscience on many points, their benevolence, their uprightness, their generosity, they are under the dominion (I must say it) of a proud fiend; they have this stout spirit within them, they determine to be their own masters in matters of thought, about which they know so little; they consider their own reason better than any one's else; they will not admit that any one comes from God who contradicts their own view of truth. What! is none their equal in wisdom anywhere? is there none other whose word is to be taken on religion? is there none to wrest from them their ultimate appeal to themselves? Have they in no possible way the occasion or opportunity of faith? Is it a virtue, which, in consequence of their transcendent sagacity, their prerogative of omniscience, they must give up hope of exercising? If the pretensions of the Catholic Church do not satisfy them, let them go somewhere else, if they can. If they are so fastidious that they cannot trust her as the oracle of God, let them find another more certainly from Him than the House of His own institution, which has ever been called by His name, has ever maintained the same claims, has ever taught one substance of doctrine, and has triumphed over those who preached any other. Since Apostolic faith was in the beginning reliance on man's word, as being God's word, since what faith was then such it is now, since faith is necessary for salvation, let them attempt to exercise it towards another, if they will not accept the Bride of the Lamb. Let them, if they can, put faith in some of those religions which have lasted a whole two or three centuries in a corner of the earth. Let them stake their eternal prospects on kings and nobles and parliaments and soldiery, let them take some mere fiction of the law, or abortion of the schools, or idol of a populace, or upstart of a crisis, or oracle of lecture-rooms, as the prophet of God. Alas! they are hardly bestead if they must possess a virtue, which they have no means of exercising,-if they must make an act of faith, they know not on whom, and know not why!"

        From  Meditations and Devotions    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  God Alone   Thomas says to Him, "My Lord and my God."  "1. I adore Thee, O my God, with Thomas; and if I have, like him, sinned through unbelief, I adore Thee the more. I adore Thee as the One Adorable, I adore Thee as more glorious in Thy humiliation, when men despised Thee, than when Angels worshipped Thee.  Deus meus et omnia -'My God and my all.'To have Thee is to have everything I can have. O my Eternal Father, give me Thyself. I dared not have made so bold a request, it would have been presumption, unless Thou hadst encouraged me. Thou hast put it into my mouth, Thou hast clothed Thyself in my nature, Thou hast become my Brother, Thou hast died as other men die, only in far greater bitterness, that, instead of my eyeing Thee fearfully from afar, I might confidently draw near to Thee. Thou dost speak to me as Thou didst speak to Thomas, and dost beckon me to take hold of Thee. My God and my all, what could I say more than this, if I spoke to all eternity! I am full and abound and overflow, when I have Thee; but without Thee I am nothing-I wither away, I dissolve and perish. My Lord and my God, my God and my all, give me Thyself and nothing else.   2. Thomas came and touched Thy sacred wounds. O will the day ever come when I shall be allowed actually and visibly to kiss them? What a day will that be when I am thoroughly cleansed from all impurity and sin, and am fit to draw near to my Incarnate God in His palace of light above! what a morning, when having done with all penal suffering, I see Thee for the first time with these very eyes of mine, I see Thy countenance, gaze upon Thy eyes and gracious lips without quailing, and then kneel down with joy to kiss Thy feet, and am welcomed into Thy arms. O my only true Lover, the only Lover of my soul, Thee will I love now, that I may love Thee then. What a day, a long day without ending, the day of eternity, when I shall be so unlike what I am now, when I feel in myself a body of death, and am perplexed and distracted with ten thousand thoughts, any one of which would keep me from heaven. O my Lord, what a day when I shall have done once for all with all sins, venial as well as mortal, and shall stand perfect and acceptable in Thy sight, able to bear Thy presence, nothing shrinking from Thy eye, not shrinking from the pure scrutiny of Angels and Archangels, when I stand in the midst and they around me!  3. O my God, though I am not fit to see or touch Thee yet, still I will ever come within Thy reach, and desire that which is not yet given me in its fulness. O my Saviour, Thou shalt be my sole God!-I will have no Lord but Thee. I will break to pieces all idols in my heart which rival Thee. I will have nothing but Jesus and Him crucified. It shall be my life to pray to Thee, to offer myself to Thee, to keep Thee before me, to worship Thee in Thy holy Sacrifice, and to surrender myself to Thee in Holy Communion.

       On May 1, 1851  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  On Mary as the Pattern of the Natural World   " 1. INTROD.-Why May the month of Mary?  2. Consider what May denotes. It is the youth of the year; its beauty, grace and purity. Next is its fertility; all things bud forth. The virgin and mother.  3. See how the ecclesiastical year answers to it. Our Lord passed His time in the winter-born at Christmas, etc. He struggles on. We sympathise with Him. We fast in Lent-the rough weather continues. He comes to His death and burial when the weather is still bad, yet with promise-fits of better anticipations. He rises; the weather mends; but, as He was not known as risen, not all at once. But at length it is not doubtful. He is a risen king, and, still the weather gets warmer. As a climax May comes, and He gives His mother.  4. Such is the comparison. Nothing so beautiful in the natural world as the season when it opens. Nothing so beautiful in the supernatural as Mary. The more you know of this world the more beautiful you would know it to be-in other climates-beauty of scenery, etc., etc.  5. But this is not all. Alas, the world is so beautiful as to tempt us to idolatry. St. Peter said, 'It is good to be here' [on Mt. Thabor], but 'It is not good to be in the world.' Say 'Hast thou tracked a traveller round,' etc.; all that is so beautiful tempts us. Hence all Nature tends to sin (not in itself), etc.   6. Here then a further reason why the month is given to Mary, viz. in order that we may sanctify the year.  And thus she is a better Eve. Eve, too, in the beginning may be called the May of the year. She was the first-fruits of God's beautiful creation. She was the type of all beauty; but alas! she represented the world also in its fragility. She stayed not in her original creation. Mary comes as a second and holier Eve, having the grace of indefectibility and the gift of perseverance from the first, and teaching us how to use God's gifts without abusing them. "

       The feast of Pope St. Pius V, O.P.   is today. There is information on him  urlLink here.  Happy feast day to all the  urlLink Dominicans  out there !  " St. Pius became Pope in 1566, and Selim became Sultan in that very same year. What a strange contrast did Rome and Constantinople present at that era! Neither was what it had been. But they had changed in opposite directions. Both had been the seat of Imperial Power; Rome, where heresy never throve, had exchanged its Emperor for the succession of St. Peter and St. Paul; Constantinople had passed from secular supremacy into schism, and thence into a blasphemous apostasy. The unhappy city, which, with its subject provinces had been successively the seat of Arianism, of Nestorianism, of Photianism, now had become the metropolis of the false Prophet; and, while in the West, the great edifice of the Vatican Basilica was rising anew in its wonderful proportions and its costly materials, the Temple of St. Sophia in the East was degraded into a Mosque! O the strange contrast in the state of the inhabitants of each place! Here, in the city of Constantine, a God-denying misbelief was accompanied by an impure, man-degrading rule of life, by the slavery of woman, and the corruption of youth. But there, in the city which Apostles had consecrated with their blood, the great and true reformation of the age was in full progress. There, the determinations in doctrine and discipline of the great Council of Trent had lately been promulgated. There, for twenty years past, had laboured our own dear saint, St. Philip, till he earned the title of Apostle of Rome, and yet had still nearly thirty years of life and work in him. There, too, the romantic royal-minded saint, Ignatius Loyola, had but lately died. And there, when the Holy See fell vacant, and a Pope had to be appointed in the great need of the Church, a Saint was present in the Conclave to find in it a brother Saint, and to recommend him for the Chair of St. Peter, to the suffrages of the Fathers and Princes of the Church."- Venerable John Henry Newman,C.O.,  Historical Sketches, Volume One    It is also the feast of  urlLink St. Joseph Benedict Cottolengo, Priest and Founder ,  urlLink Blessed Marie Guyart of the Incarnation,S.U.   and  urlLink Blessed William Southerne, Priest and Martyr. .

       Sympathy   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Souls of the Just, I call not you      To share this joy with me,  This joy and wonder at the view      Of mountain, plain, and sea;   Ye, on that loftier mountain old,      Safe lodged in Eden's cell,  Whence run the rivers four, behold      This earth, as ere it fell.   Or, when ye think of those who stay      Still tried by the world's fight,  'Tis but in looking for the day      Which shall the lost unite.   Ye rather, elder Spirits strong!      Who from the first have trod  This nether scene, man's race among,      The while you live to God,   Ye see, and ye can sympathize-      Vain thought! their mighty ken  Fills height and depth, the stars, the skies,      They smile at dim-eyed men.   Ah, Saviour! I perforce am Thine,      Angel and Saint apart:  Those searching Eyes are all-divine,      All-human is that Heart."   Agosta. April 29, 1833.

       On April 28, 1872  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  Prophecy  " 1. INTROD.-I have said that as our Lord went away suddenly, so will He come again. Next, that there will be a great token of His coming, viz. a falling away. Thirdly, that it will still be sudden, because that falling away is in almost every age, or, at least, again and again.  2. Now some passages in Scripture about the falling away: 1 Tim. iv. [1], 2 Tim. iii. [1-5], ib. iv. [3] , 2 Peter iii. [3-4] .  3. About the suddenness, Matt. xxiv. 27, 'For as lightning cometh out of the east, and appeareth even unto the west, so shall the coming of the Son of man be.'  4. Infallible word, commented on by theologians through ages: 'Blessed are those who hear,' etc.  5. Of course at all times there is a spirit of prophecy in the Church, and there are holy men and women, though there is no proof of this [in the stories now abroad].  6. It seems to me a great pity that Catholics leave Scripture prophecy, which is the infallible word, for rumours and stories about prophecies without foundation, e.g. at this very time.  7. Orval coming up again (vide  Rambler , vol. iv. p. 73).  8. Shifting according to circumstances?instance of 1748.  9. But still the word of God stands sure and cannot be superseded. If they are true, they co-operate with Scripture and do not oppose it.  10. Now this great contrast between these so-called prophecies and Scripture, the one prophecy good, the other evil.  11. Those who are always looking for good, are always disappointed; but it is our comfort and glory to know that the Church always triumphs, though it seems always failing.  12. Hence two lessons: (1) The bad state of things is to remind us of His coming and its suddenness. (2) We are encouraged under it by the feeling it is our  special portion   to be in trouble, 2 Cor. iv. 8-9 .  13. Three lessons: (1) To remind and warn. (2) To calm us, because in every age. (3) To give us faith and hope, from the sight of the Church's continual victory. "

       On April 27, 1879  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., had a private audience with the Holy Father, Pope Leo XIII, prior to the same Holy Father making him a Cardinal. He described this meeting in a letter home to one of the Fathers of the Birmingham Oratory. '"Via Sistina No. 48: May 2, 1879. 'My dear Henry, Your letter came safe and thank you for it. I have been laid up with a bad cold ever since I have been here. Yesterday and today I have been in bed. It has seized my throat and continues hard. I have had advice, but it does nothing for me. The weather is so bad-I think it will not go till Spring weather comes. It pulls me down sadly. Here great days are passing, and I a prisoner in the house. It answers to my general experience of Roman weather.  The Holy Father received me most affectionately-keeping my hand in his. He asked me, 'Do you intend to continue head of the Birmingham House?' I answered, 'That depends on the Holy Father.' He then said, 'Well then I wish you to continue head,' and he went on to speak of this at length, saying there was a precedent for it in one of Gregory XVI.'s cardinals.  He asked me various questions-was our house a good one? was our Church? how many were we? of what age? When I said, we had lost some, he put his hand on my head and said 'Don't cry.' He asked 'had we any lay brothers?' How then did we do for a cook? I said we had a widow woman, and the kitchen was cut off from the house. He said 'bene.' Where did I get my theology? at Propaganda? etc. etc. When I was leaving he accepted a copy of my four Latin Dissertations, in the Roman Edition. I certainly did not think his mouth large till he smiled, and then the ends turned up, but not unpleasantly-he has a clear white complexion-his eyes somewhat bloodshot-but this might have been the accident of the day. He speaks very slowly and clearly and with an Italian manner.  William has had a letter to Austin on the stocks for some days. I hope it went a day or two ago. Love to all. Ever yours afftly., JOHN H. NEWMAN. "

        From Discourses to Mixed Congregations  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "A Prophet is one who comes from God, who speaks with authority, who is ever one and the same, who is precise and decisive in his statements, who is equal to successive difficulties, and can smite and overthrow error. Such has the Catholic Church shown herself in her history, such is she at this day. She alone has had the Divine spell of controlling the reason of man, and of eliciting faith in her word from high and low, educated and ignorant, restless and dull-minded. Even those who are alien to her, and whom she does not move to obedience, she moves to respect and admiration. The most profound thinkers and the most sagacious politicians predict her future triumphs while they marvel at her past. Her enemies are frightened at the sight of her, and have no better mode of warfare against her than that of blackening her with slanders, or of driving her into the wilderness. To see her is to recognise her; her look and bearing is the evidence of her royal lineage. True, her tokens might be clearer than they are; I grant it; she might have been set up in Adam, and not in Peter; she might have embraced the whole family of man; she might have been the instrument of inwardly converting all hearts; she might have had no scandals within or misfortunes without; she might in short have been, I repeat, a heaven on earth; but, I repeat, does she not show as glorious in our sight as a creature, as her God does as the Creator? If He does not display the highest possible tokens of His presence in nature, why should His Messenger display such in grace? You believe the Scriptures; does she not in her character and conduct show as Divine as Jacob does, or as Samuel, or as David, or as Jeremias, or in a far higher measure? Has she not notes far more than sufficient for the purpose of convincing you? She takes her rise from the very coming of Christ, and receives her charter, as also her very form and mission, from His mouth. 'Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father who is in heaven. And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed also in heaven.'

       From the homily  Fr. Michael was the celebrant at the 12:10 pm Mass today. What I remember most from his homily was his comments about Our Lord's command, " Do not work for food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you." This is, of course, the Eucharist, in which Christ gives Himself to us- Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity. He lets us take Himself into our very beings, consume Him, that we might follow Him more closely. On the other hand, when we refuse to follow Him, we ourselves end up being consumed by our sin. (He named Gollum as a good literary example- in his selfish desire he ends up a shrivelled shadow of a being. )

       On April 26, 1944  the Professor wrote a letter to his youngest son, Christopher..... "Yesterday felt effects of Sunday night. Went off early to town and did some executors business for Mrs. Wright , gave a poor lecture, saw the Lewises and C.W. (White Horse) for 1/2 hour; mowed three lawns, and wrote letter to John, and struggled with recalcitrant passage in 'The Ring'. At this point I require to know how much later the moon gets up each night when nearing full, and how to stew a rabbit ! "  (Note: "C.W." was Charles Williams. "John" was John Tolkien, the Professor's eldest son. )

       From  Discourses to Mixed Congregations   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "Such are the means which God has provided for the creation of the Saint out of the sinner; He takes him as he is, and uses him against himself: He turns his affections into another channel, and extinguishes a carnal love by infusing a heavenly charity. Not as if He used him as a mere irrational creature, who is impelled by instincts and governed by external incitements without any will of his own, and to whom one pleasure is the same as another, the same in kind, though different in degree. I have already said, it is the very triumph of His grace, that He enters into the heart of man, and persuades it, and prevails with it, while He changes it. He violates in nothing that  original constitution of mind which He gave to man: He treats him as man; He leaves him the liberty of acting this way or that; He appeals to all his powers and faculties, to his reason, to his prudence, to his moral sense, to his conscience: He rouses his fears as well as his love; He instructs him in the depravity of sin, as well as in the mercy of God; but still, on the whole, the animating principle of the new life, by which it is both kindled and sustained, is the flame of charity. This only is strong enough to destroy the old Adam, to dissolve the tyranny of habit, to quench the fires of concupiscence, and to burn up the strongholds of pride.  And hence it is that love is presented to us as the distinguishing grace of those who were sinners before they were Saints; not that love is not the life of all Saints, of those who have never needed a conversion, of the Most Blessed Virgin, of the two St. John's, and of those others, many in number, who are 'first-fruits unto God and the Lamb;' but that, while in those who have never sinned gravely love is so contemplative as almost to resolve itself into the sanctity of God Himself; in those, on the contrary, in whom it dwells as a principle of recovery, it is so full of devotion, of zeal, of activity, and good works, that it gives a visible character to their history, and is ever associating itself with our thoughts of them.  Such was the great Apostle, on whom the Church is built, and whom I contrasted, when I began, with his fellow-Apostle St. John: whether we contemplate him after his first calling, or on his repentance, he who denied his Lord, out of all the Apostles, is the most conspicuous for his love of Him. It was for this love of Christ, flowing on, as it did, from its impetuosity and exuberance, into love of the brethren, that he was chosen to be the chief Pastor of the fold. 'Simon, son of John, lovest thou Me more than these?' was the trial put on him by his Lord; and the reward was, 'Feed My lambs, feed My sheep'. Wonderful to say, the Apostle whom Jesus loved, was yet surpassed in love for Jesus by a brother Apostle, not virginal as he; for it is not John of whom our Lord asked this question, and who was rewarded with this commission, but Peter. Look back at an earlier passage of the same narrative; there, too, the two Apostles are similarly contrasted in their respective characters; for when they were in the boat, and their Lord spoke to them from the shore, and 'they knew not that it was Jesus,' first 'that disciple, whom Jesus loved, said to Peter, It is the Lord,' for 'the clean of heart shall see God;' and then at once 'Simon Peter,' in the impetuosity of his love, 'girt his tunic about him, and cast himself into the sea,' to reach Him the quicker. St. John beholds and St. Peter acts."

       On May 8, 1851  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  On Mary as Our Mother  "1. INTROD.-Our Lord from the cross said, 'Behold thy mother.' These words, spoken to St. John, have been considered by the Church to apply to us all.   2. When our Lord went up on high, He supplied us with all those relations in a spiritual way which we have in a natural way. He is all of them-our physician, our teacher, our ruler or pastor, our father and our mother. Explain how our mother-as bearing us in pain. 'Shall a mother forget her sucking child?' and in nourishing us with the milk of the Holy Eucharist.  3. And as St. Peter the one pastor, as St. John, etc., and the prophets and doctors [as teachers], as priests His physicians, so He has left His own mother to be our mother.  4. 'Behold thy mother,' etc. Month of Mary.  5. Now consider what is meant by this-a mother's special gift-fostering care, tenderness, compassion, unfailing love, so that whenever we would express what is home, and a refuge, and a retreat, and a school of love, we call it our mother. Our country is our mother: our schools, colleges, universities, etc., etc. Hence the Church.  6. This is what Mary fulfils to all who seek her care, and in a far higher degree than any mother can do; for,  7. First, many lose their mothers, or have unkind mothers, etc. Everything of earth fades.  8. Second, a human mother's standard of things may be wrong: it may lead from God, hence human affections keep so many from the Church.  9. Everything human has a chance of fostering idolatry. What is always present hides the unseen.  10. Our heavenly mother cannot fail and cannot err, cannot obscure her Son and Lord, but reminds of Him.  11. Let us try to get this filial feeling, though we can only learn it by degrees, and cannot force ourselves into it. "

       Mary is the "Rosa Mystica," the Mystical Rose   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "How did Mary become the  Rosa Mystica , the choice, delicate, perfect flower of God's spiritual creation? It was by being born, nurtured and sheltered in the mystical garden or Paradise of God. Scripture makes use of the figure of a garden, when it would speak of heaven and its blessed inhabitants. A garden is a spot of ground set apart for trees and plants, all good, all various, for things that are sweet to the taste or fragrant in scent, or beautiful to look upon, or useful for nourishment; and accordingly in its spiritual sense it means the home of blessed spirits and holy souls dwelling there together, souls with both the flowers and the fruits upon them, which by the careful husbandry of God they have come to bear, flowers and fruits of grace, flowers more beautiful and more fragrant than those of any garden, fruits more delicious and exquisite than can be matured by earthly husbandman.  All that God has made speaks of its Maker; the mountains speak of His eternity; the sun of His immensity, and the winds of His Almightiness. In like manner flowers and fruits speak of His sanctity, His love, and His providence; and such as are flowers and fruits, such must be the place where they are found. That is to say, since they are found in a garden, therefore a garden has also excellences which speak of God, because it is their home. For instance, it would be out of place if we found beautiful flowers on the mountain-crag, or rich fruit in the sandy desert. As then by flowers and fruits are meant, in a mystical sense, the gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, so by a garden is meant mystically a place of spiritual repose, stillness, peace, refreshment, and delight.  Thus our first parents were placed in 'a garden of pleasure'shaded by trees, 'fair to behold and pleasant to eat of,' with the Tree of Life in the midst, and a river to water the ground. Thus our Lord, speaking from the cross to the penitent robber, calls the blessed place, the heaven to which He was taking him, 'paradise,' or a garden of pleasure. Therefore St. John, in the Apocalypse, speaks of heaven, the palace of God, as a garden or paradise, in which was the Tree of Life giving forth its fruits every month.  Such was the garden in which the Mystical Rose, the Immaculate Mary, was sheltered and nursed to be the Mother of the All Holy God, from her birth to her espousals to St. Joseph, a term of thirteen years. For three years of it she was in the arms of her holy mother, St. Anne, and then for ten years she lived in the temple of God. In those blessed gardens, as they may be called, she lived by herself, continually visited by the dew of God's grace, and growing up a more and more heavenly flower, till at the end of that period she was meet for the inhabitation in her of the Most Holy. This was the outcome of the Immaculate Conception. Excepting her, the fairest rose in the paradise of God has had upon it blight, and has had the risk of canker-worm and locust. All but Mary; she from the first was perfect in her sweetness and her beautifulness, and at length when the angel Gabriel had to come to her, he found her 'full of grace,'which had, from her good use of it, accumulated in her from the first moment of her being.

        From  Discourses to Mixed Congregations   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  " If the  Deipara  is to witness of Emmanuel, she must be necessarily more than the  Deipara . For consider; a defence must be strong in order to be a defence; a tower must be, like that Tower of David, 'built with bulwarks'; 'a thousand bucklers hang upon it, all the armour of valiant men'. It would not have sufficed, in order to bring out and impress on us the idea that God is man, had His Mother been an ordinary person. A mother without a home in the Church, without dignity, without gifts, would have been, as far as the defence of the Incarnation goes, no mother at all. She would not have remained in the memory, or the imagination of men. If she is to witness and remind the world that God became man, she must be on a high and eminent station for the purpose. She must be made to fill the mind, in order to suggest the lesson. When she once attracts our attention, then, and not till then, she begins to preach Jesus. 'Why should she have such prerogatives,' we ask, 'unless He be God? and what must He be by nature, when she is so high by grace?' This is why she has other prerogatives besides, namely, the gifts of personal purity and intercessory power, distinct from her maternity; she is personally endowed that she may perform her office well; she is exalted in herself that she may minister to Christ."

        I received an urgent e-mail from Kat Lively....  and am herewith posting it on the blog...... " Urgent! ******* Urgent! ******* Urgent!  Stop the Morning-After Pill! Over-the-Counter approval to be decided by the FDA May 21.   No age limits, no medical supervision, no parental involvement!  Spread this far and wide! Time is of the essense! Call the White House, contact your Senators and Congressmen!  For instructions on how to email the FDA directly with an email link go to href="http://www.pop.org/main.cfm?id=215&r1=2.00&r2=2.00&r3=0.05&r4=0.00&lev el=3&eid=553">this page of the PRI Website. More info below.  From the Population Research Institute Weekly Briefing:  Dear Colleague:  There is still time for pro-lifers to  call the White House (202-456-1414)  and urge the President to assure the American people that the mega dose "morning after pill" will not be sold "over the counter."  Also contact your U.S. Senator or Representative to urge leadership from Congress that will protect women and babies from this new chemical assault weapon.   Toll free: 1-800-648-3516 or 1-877-762-8762.  The abortion establishment is going all out to urge their followers to lobby in favor of making this chemical killer available over the counter. Their mailings include the lie that so-called "emergency contraception" does not cause abortion and does not work if a women is already pregnant. Over the counter approval of the "morning after pill" will be a public health disaster.  Steven W. Mosher President  PRI Weekly Briefing 12 May 2004 Vol. 6 / No. 17   Stop the Morning-After Pill!  Press reports suggest that the FDA is teetering on the brink of approving the so-called morning-after pill. As past PRI Weekly Briefings have made clear, there are terrible risks in making this powerful drug available over-the-counter with no age restrictions or parental involvement.   The progestin-only hormonal contraceptive in Norplant is the same active ingredient as Plan B. Norplant is no longer available for use in the United States because it is so dangerous. Known risks include significant weight gain, ovarian cyst enlargement, gallbladder disease, high blood pressure and respiratory disorders.   Among teenagers, some of these common side effects could result in increased rates of bulimia, anorexia, or clinical depression. Also, an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy has been associated with use of Plan B-type emergency contraception.   Since the drug precludes parental involvement, it is likely that teenage girls who buy Plan B at the drugstore then experience abdominal pain may not confide in parents so that a physician could diagnose if a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy had occurred. Over-the-counter approval would mean that young people would be free to purchase and use (abuse) this powerful hormone without supervision or follow up.   The drug was approved for over-the-counter use on January 1 in Australia. Already there are reports in the Australian press of 13-year-old girls buying the pill several times a week to the alarm of local pharmacists who are not able to give proper counseling to these girls on the many risks involved. The Australian Medical Association is already questioning the wisdom of making this risky drug so easily available without restriction. (The West Australian, 4/4/04)   If over-the-counter availability of this drug is approved, we may also expect that rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among teens will skyrocket. Adolescents age 15-19 currently represent 46% of all cases of Chlamydia in the U.S. 1 in 4 sexually active teenagers contract an STD at some point. In Washington State and in Sweden, where emergency contraception has been made widely available, rates of STD infection are skyrocketing.   We can also expect an increase in the rates of sexual violence committed against adolescent girls. The easy availability of this drug over-the-counter will make it more difficult for teenage girls to resist pressure to have sex, and will trivialize the act of rape.   Over-the-counter availability of the morning after pill will lead to an increase in the pregnancy rate among teenagers. Studies have shown that increased rates of pregnancy occur among teens with increased use of "emergency contraception." Another showed that teenagers whose pregnancies ended in induced abortion were more likely to have used the drug before conception, and that teens who use the drug were more willing to engage in "risk-taking" behavior.  Please take time to call the White House or, better yet, jot a note to your Senator or Congressman regarding the morning after pill. If it goes over-the-counter as scheduled on May 21, then anything goes. Lives will be compromised and families further undermined. A sample letter follows:  April 29, 2004   Dear Senator ____________ (or Congressman _____________):  I understand the FDA is set to decide whether or not the morning-after-pill (MAP) will go over-the-counter on 21 May 2004. I believe that pressure from you and your colleagues could stop this dangerous drug from being made available to very young girls without medical supervision or parental knowledge. Would you please advise the FDA to cease and desist? If MAP is approved, then it wont be long before the FDA makes the birth control pill available over-the-counter. This will further compromise the sanctity of life and the integrity of the family.  Thank you.   (Signed) Your name Address City, State. Zip  Phone  © 2004 Population Research Institute.

       On May 5, 1872  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:   Holy Scripture   "1. We are so ignorant, and the world so confused, that there is a natural desire to know the future (trust in superstitions, fortune-tellers, etc., etc.). A future must come, and we know nothing about it, and desire to know it.  2. Fortune-tellers about ourselves and public affairs-almanacs; and so Catholics have their prophets.  3. All those reports such as Catholics are apt to be beguiled with, have two tokens of error. They do not appeal to or carry on Scripture prophecy; next, they are different from Scripture prophecy, as I said last week.  4. Now, though there was no direct comfort and instruction to be gained from Scripture prophecy, it would be a duty to keep it in view, because it  is  in Scripture-because it is the inspired word of God.  5. And this great evil arises from neglecting it, because Protestants take it up and interpret it wrongly; they interpret it against  us - our  Scripture becomes a weapon in their hands because we have relinquished it to them.  6. But great  edification  does come from reading Scripture prophecy; and a blessing is promised on those who read. Very little is told us about the future; nothing to gratify our curiosity, but with it real edification.  7. The Apocalypse brings before us the conflict between Christ and the world.  8. And so of other Scriptures-the Gospel the best spiritual book-St. Paul's epistles, the Psalms.  9. Pius VI.'s declaration. This why so many French and Italians have become infidels.  10. To know Christ is to know Scripture-an anchor. "

       On May 4, 1843   Venerable John Henry Newman  wrote to a friend who was upset over his plan to leave the Anglican ministry.  "At present I fear, as far as I can analyze my own convictions, I consider the Roman Catholic Communion to be the Church of the Apostles, and that what grace is among us (which, through God's mercy, is not little) is extraordinary, and from the overflowings of His dispensation. I am very far more sure that England is in schism, than that the Roman additions to the Primitive Creed may not be developments, arising out of a keen and vivid realizing of the Divine Depositum of Faith.  You will now understand what gives edge to the Bishops' Charges, without any undue sensitiveness on my part. They distress me in two ways:-first, as being in some sense protests and witnesses to my conscience against my own unfaithfulness to the English Church, and next, as being samples of her teaching, and tokens how very far she is from even aspiring to Catholicity.  Of course my being unfaithful to a trust is my great subject of dread,-as it has long been, as you know...."   On May 4, 1851, the Venerable, now both a Catholic and an Oratorian, preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:   On the Good Shepherd and Lost Sheep  "1. INTROD.-God is from eternity and ever blessed in Himself, and needs nothing.  2. On His, being such, taking part in things of time.  3. An office of ministration-one towards things physical; a further towards things moral, i.e. which have free will.  4. A further still towards man fallen-on his waywardness, arising from concupiscence and ignorance-and even the just [not exempt]-of which ignorance remains more fully in all. Ignorance is the best estate. This is portrayed in sheep. Other animals are fearful, etc., and represent sinners, but the innocent sheep, ignorant and helpless, is the fit type of the just. What a picture this gives us! We are tempted to laugh at sheep, who will not go the right way, start at every noise, do not know the meaning of anything, and are obliged to be forced by terror, as by the dog; yet it is our best image. Our Lord, the Good Shepherd, is obliged to frighten us, etc., etc. Yet so patient.  5. O how patient towards us! But more than patient-the lost sheep, and His laying down His life for it-the wolf-nay, and that a one, though one.  6. What is meant by  one ? Because any one must consider Himself the one. Every one is  worst  to himself: he alone knows himself.  7. On St. Augustine, this day St. Monica's day.  8. Does the Church lament over you, O  one  sinner! Here we are in the happy time of the year-Christ risen and the month of May come-yet you have not been to your duties, or have not got absolution, or have fallen again into sin. Mater Ecclesia deplores you, our blessed Lord deplores you, etc. "

       I received an e-mail...  from a group doing  urlLink important work . (It doesn't hurt that they have a great name as well !)  Here's most of the text of the e-mail: " NATIONAL STUDY REVEALS PRO-ABORTION, RELATED ACTIVITY AT CATHOLIC COLLEGES SINCE 1999   - 56-Page Report Documents Scandals in Catholic Higher Education -   MANASSAS, VA (April 28, 2004)  Cardinal Newman Society has issued a shocking new report on scandals at U.S. Catholic colleges and universities that is certain to reignite concerns about the colleges religious character.   The 56-page report, 'The Culture of Death on Catholic Campuses: A Five-Year Review,' documents inroads made by advocates of abortion, contraception, premarital sexual activity, and physician-assisted suicide onto Catholic college campuses since 1999.  It is the most extensive evidence of problems in Catholic higher education ever compiled in a single sourceand yet it only scratches the surface, relying primarily on media reports and college websites.   ' "Pro-choice" is no choice for a Catholic institution, which by its Catholic mission must be courageously pro-life,' said Erin Butcher, lead researcher and co-author of the report.  'Cardinal Newman Society has responded to scandal after scandal on Catholic campuses, but many Catholics still fail to appreciate the scope of the problem.'   The report, which can be downloaded free of charge at www.cardinalnewmansociety.org beginning April 28, identifies the problems and suggests solutions to ensure that Catholic colleges uphold their Catholic, pro-life mission.  Highlights include:   *  Pro-abortion presidential candidates at Catholic colleges.  In January, St. Anselm College (N.H.) hosted seven pro-abortion candidates for their final debate before New Hampshires Democratic primary.  Other campaign appearances have included John Kerry at Georgetown in January 2003, Dennis Kucinich at Sacred Heart University last June, Howard Dean at St. Anselm last September and at Georgetown last October, Dick Gephardts daughter at Boston College last November, Gephardt and Kerry at Clarke College (Iowa) in January, Wesley Clark at Rivier College (N.H.) in January, and Kerry at Georgetown again in April.   *  Nearly 200 instances of campus speakers and honorees who have been public advocates of abortion or otherwise contributors to the 'Culture of Death'. These include at least 17 visits and lectures by President Bill Clinton at Georgetown University, researchers engaged in human cloning and embryonic cell research at Assumption College and the College of the Holy Cross, NARAL Pro-Choice America president Kate Michelman at Boston College law school, radical feminist Gloria Steinem at Fairfield University, pornographer Larry Flynt at Georgetown University, and National Organization for Women (NOW) president Kim Gandy at Loyola University of New Orleans.   *  'Emergency contraception,' an abortifacient, provided to students by the College of Santa Fe and Rockhurst University.   *  College officials and faculty with ties to pro-abortion and pro-euthanasia organizations, including a Boston College law professor on the board of directors of the Death With Dignity National Center; a Georgetown University philosophy professor on the board of directors of the Compassion in Dying Federation, and two Georgetown University womens studies professors who are also employees of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.   *  Pro-abortion politicians serving as college officials and faculty, including Carol Moseley Braun teaching management at DePaul University, Geraldine Ferraro on the Fordham University law school Board of Visitors and teaching public policy at Georgetown University, and Leon Panetta teaching political science and on the Board of Trustees and law school Board of Visitors at Santa Clara University.   *  Pro-abortion student clubs including the Reproductive Choice Coalition at Boston College law school, Hoyas for Choice at Georgetown University, Georgetown Students for Choice at Georgetown law school, and a NOW chapter at St. Ambrose University.   *  Internships and service opportunities offered by Catholic colleges, including service as a Planned Parenthood 'clinic escort' promoted by Nazareth Colleges campus ministry and internships with Planned Parenthood offered by Villanova University.   *  Website referrals to pro-abortion organizations as medical or academic resources including Georgetown University links to local abortion clinics, LaSalle University links to NOW and the Feminist Majority Foundation, Loyola University of Chicago links to Planned Parenthood and the Feminist Majority Foundation, Loyola University of New Orleans links to NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood, and Seton Hall University links to the Feminist Majority Foundation and NOW.   *  Student newspapers promoting sex and contraception, including sex advice columns titled 'Sex and the University' in The Heights at Boston College and 'Sex on the Hilltop' in The Hoya at Georgetown University.

        From  Parochial and Plain Sermons   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Make use, then, of this Holy Easter Season, which lasts forty to fifty days, to become more like Him who died for you, and who now liveth for evermore. He promises us, 'Because I live, ye shall live also.' He, by dying on the Cross, opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers. He first died, and then He opened heaven. We, therefore, first commemorate His death, and then, for some weeks in succession, we commemorate and show forth the joys of heaven. They who do not rejoice in the weeks after Easter, would not rejoice in heaven itself. These weeks are a sort of beginning of heaven. Pray God to enable you to rejoice; to enable you to keep the Feast duly. Pray God to make you better Christians. This world is a dream,-you will get no good from it. Perhaps you find this difficult to believe; but be sure so it is. Depend upon it, at the last, you will confess it. Young people expect good from the world, and people of middle age devote themselves to it, and even old people do not like to give it up. But the world is your enemy, and the flesh is your enemy. Come to God, and beg of Him grace to devote yourselves to Him. Beg of Him the will to follow Him; beg of Him the power to obey Him. O how comfortable, pleasant, sweet, soothing, and satisfying is it to lead a holy life,-the life of Angels! It is difficult at first; but with God's grace, all things are possible. "  This is from a  urlLink sermon  he preached on May 3, 1840. (He was still Anglican at that point. )

       Please pray ......  for these  urlLink  very misguided folks in my diocese.  The article gets some things wrong, of course, such as the Catholic view on the possibility of salvation for those outside the Church. (I'm just hoping most of them are currently invinicibly ignorant- the few who are cited sound like it.) What really gets me is this quote from "Fr." Hausen. "I feel that the greatest theology today will come from your experience of yourself . . . not from above or from someone imposing stuff on us..."  If that were true, we'd all be in serious trouble, Fr. Narcissus. Gee, you'd think that with a past like his he'd at least be aware of original sin.....

       If it were not Sunday...  today would be the feast of  urlLink St. Athanasius, Bishop and Doctor of the Church . As I noted  urlLink last year , he was one of Venerable Newman's favorite saints, and he wrote about him and referred to him often.  " 'Did St. Athanasius, or St. Ambrose, come suddenly to life, it cannot be doubted,' I said ironically, 'what communion they would mistake for their own. All surely will agree that these Fathers, with whatever differences of opinion, whatever protests, if we will, would find themselves more at home with such men as St. Bernard, or St. Ignatius Loyola, or with the lonely priest in his lodgings, or the holy sisterhood of Charity, or the unlettered crowd before the altar, than with the rulers or members of any other religious community. And may we not add, that were the two Saints, who once sojourned in exile or on embassage at Treves, to come more northward still, and to travel until they reached another fair city, seated among groves, green meadows, and calm streams, the holy brothers would turn from many a high aisle and solemn cloister which they found there, and ask the way to some small chapel, where mass was said, in the populous alley or the forlorn suburb? And, on the other hand, can any one who has but heard his name, and cursorily read his history, doubt for one instant, how the people of England, in turn, "we, our princes, our priests, and our prophets," Lords and Commons, Universities, Ecclesiastical Courts, marts of commerce, great towns, country parishes, would deal with Athanasius,-Athanasius, who spent his long years in fighting against kings for a theological term?

"THE FATHERS OF THE ORATORY  invite you to join them in celebrating  The Commemeration of Their Founder   St. PHILIP NERI Wednesday, May 26, 2004 7:00 pm Mass in Heinz Chapel Refreshments following at The Oratory 4450 Bayard Street  R.S.V.P. by May 21: 681-3181"  The facing page of the invitation has the following verse:   St. Philip in his God   "Philip, on thee the glowing ray      Of heaven came down upon thy prayer,  To melt thy heart, and burn away      All that of earthly dross was there.   And so, on Philip when we gaze,      We see the image of his Lord;  The Saint dissolves amid the blaze      Which circles round the Living Word.   The Sinless One, He comes to seek,      The dreary heart, the spirit lone,  Tender of natures proud or weak,      Not less than if they were His own.   Jesu, to Philip's sons reveal      That gentlest wisdom from above,  To spread compassion o'er their zeal,      And mingle patience with their love.   J.H. Newman      The Oratory                        1850 "

       Mary is the  Mater Christi , the Mother of Christ  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "Each of the titles of Mary has its own special meaning and drift, and may be made the subject of a distinct meditation. She is invoked by us as the  Mother of Christ . What is the force of thus addressing her? It is to bring before us that she it is whom from the first was prophesied of, and associated with the hopes and prayers of all holy men, of all true worshippers of God, of all who 'looked for the redemption of Israel' in every age before that redemption came.  Our Lord was called the Christ, or the Messias, by the Jewish prophets and the Jewish people. The two words Christ and Messias mean the same. They mean in English the 'Anointed.' In the old time there were three great ministries or offices by means of which God spoke to His chosen people, the Israelites, or, as they were afterward called, the Jews, viz., that of Priest, that of King, and that of Prophet. Those who were chosen by God for one or other of these offices were solemnly anointed with oiloil signifying the grace of God, which was given to them for the due performance of their high duties. But our Lord was all three, a Priest, a Prophet, and a King-a Priest, because He offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins; a Prophet, because He revealed to us the Holy Law of God; and a King, because He rules over us. Thus He is the one true Christ.  It was in expectation of this great Messias that the chosen people, the Jews, or Israelites, or Hebrews (for these are different names for the same people), looked out from age to age. He was to come to set all things right. And next to this great question which occupied their minds, namely,  When  was He to come, was the question,  Who  was to be His Mother? It had been told them from the first, not that He should come from heaven, but that He should be born of a Woman. At the time of the fall of Adam, God had said that the seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpent's head. Who, then, was to be that Woman thus significantly pointed out to the fallen race of Adam? At the end of many centuries, it was further revealed to the Jews that the great Messias, or Christ, the  seed  of the  Woman , should be born of their race, and of one particular tribe of the twelve tribes into which that race was divided. From that time every woman of that tribe hoped to have the great privilege of herself being the Mother of the Messias, or Christ; for it stood to reason, since He was so great, the Mother must be great, and good, and blessed too. Hence it was, among other reasons, that they thought so highly of the marriage state, because, not knowing the mystery of the miraculous conception of the Christ when He was actually to come, they thought that the marriage rite was the ordinance necessary for His coming.  Hence it was, if Mary had been as other women, she would have longed for marriage, as opening on her the prospect of bearing the great King. But she was too humble and too pure for such thoughts. She had been inspired to choose that better way of serving God which had not been made known to the Jewsthe state of Virginity. She preferred to be His Spouse to being His Mother. Accordingly, when the Angel Gabriel announced to her her high destiny, she shrank from it till she was assured that it would not oblige her to revoke her purpose of a virgin life devoted to her God.  Thus was it that she became the Mother of the Christ, not in that way which pious women for so many ages had expected Him, but, declining the grace of such maternity, she gained it by means of a higher grace. And this is the full meaning of St. Elizabeth's words, when the Blessed Virgin came to visit her, which we use in the Hail Mary: 'Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.' And therefore it is that in the Devotion called the ' Crown of Twelve Stars ' we give praise to God the Holy Ghost, through whom she was both Virgin  and  Mother."

       The Feast of St. Isidore the Farmer  is today. There is information on him  urlLink here . Prayers for all farmers would be appropriate. St. Isidore is also notable in that he was canonized at the same ceremony as some saints who are more well-known:  urlLink St.Ignatius Loyola, S.J., Priest and Founder ,  urlLink St. Francis Xavier, S.J., Priest ,  urlLink St. Teresa of Avila, O.C.D, Virgin and Doctor of the Church , and, of course,  urlLink St. Philip Neri, C.O., Priest and Founder. .  It is also the feast of  urlLink St. Dymphna, Virgin and Martyr  and her friend  urlLink St. Gerebernus, Priest and Martyr , so prayers for the mentally ill and those who care for them would be welcome as well. Finally,it is the feast of  urlLink St. Pachomius, Abbot , one of the earliest monastics.

       The Feast of St. Matthias, Apostle and Martyr  is today. There is information on him  urlLink here.  In his Anglican days, Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., wrote  urlLink this sermon  for this feast day. Here is a small sample: "What solemn overpowering thoughts must have crowded on St. Matthias, when he received the greetings of the eleven Apostles, and took his seat among them as their brother! His very election was a witness against himself if he did not fulfil it. And such surely will ours be in our degree. We take the place of others who have gone before, as Matthias did; we are 'baptized for the dead,' filling up the ranks of soldiers, some of whom, indeed, have fought a good fight, but many of whom in every age have made void their calling. Many are called, few are chosen."  It is also the feast of  urlLink St. Maria Mazzarello, F.M.A., Virgin and Foundress . To any Salesians out there, happy feast day !

       Mary is the  Janua Coeli , the Gate of Heaven  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "Mary is called the  Gate  of Heaven, because it was through her that our Lord passed from heaven to earth. The Prophet Ezechiel, prophesying of Mary, says, 'the gate shall be closed, it shall not be opened, and no man shall pass through it, since the Lord God of Israel has entered through it-and it shall be closed for the Prince, the Prince Himself shall sit in it.'  Now this is fulfilled, not only in our Lord having taken flesh from her, and being her Son, but, moreover, in that she had a place in the economy of Redemption; it is fulfilled in her spirit and will, as well as in her body. Eve had a part in the fall of man, though it was Adam who was our representative, and whose sin made us sinners. It was Eve who began, and who tempted Adam. Scripture says: 'The woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold; and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband, and he did eat.' It was fitting then in God's mercy that, as the woman began the  destruction  of the world, so woman should also begin its  recovery , and that, as Eve opened the way for the fatal deed of the first Adam, so Mary should open the way for the great achievement of the second Adam, even our Lord Jesus Christ, who came to save the world by dying on the cross for it. Hence Mary is called by the holy Fathers a second and a better Eve, as having taken that first step in the salvation of mankind which Eve took in its ruin.  How, and when, did Mary take part, and the initial part, in the world's restoration? It was when the Angel Gabriel came to her to announce to her the great dignity which was to be her portion. St. Paul bids us 'present our bodies to God as a reasonable service.' We must not only pray with our lips, and fast, and do outward penance, and be chaste in our bodies; but we must be obedient, and pure in our minds. And so, as regards the Blessed Virgin, it was God's will that she should undertake  willingly  and with  full understanding  to be the Mother of our Lord, and not to be a mere passive instrument whose maternity would have no merit and no reward. The higher our gifts, the heavier our duties. It was no light lot to be so intimately near to the Redeemer of men, as she experienced afterwards when she suffered with him. Therefore, weighing well the Angel's words before giving her answer to themfirst she asked whether so great an office would be a forfeiture of that Virginity which she had vowed. When the Angel told her no, then, with the full consent of a full heart, full of God's love to her and her own lowliness, she said, 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done unto me according to thy word.' It was by this consent that she became the  Gate of Heaven ."   Meditations and Devotions

       May 12, 1879  was the date when Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., became John Henry  Cardinal  Newman, C.O.  His  biglietto  speech is  urlLink here.  One of the Fathers who accompainied him wrote home to Birmingham: "All has passed off beautifullyan immense crowdthe Father made a very fine speech, which you will see verbatim in the Times, and which is very heartily enjoyed here. How he managed it St. Philip knows bestbut he did not coughand his delivery was very animated, and perfect, as the vehicle of his words. Several Cardinals have comemore will be coming this evening. They are very cordial, and seem very earnestly and sincerely to look on the Father as a glorious addition to their number. One said he read English and knew the 'Apologia' &c. well. I am now easy about the FatherI have been at times uneasy. The cough is obstinate and weakness great. He seems today quite himself. Old Wagner from Brighton was present.  The Italian ladies behind me were unanimous that he was: 'che bel vecchio! che figura!' &c. &c. 'pallido si, ma bellissimo,' &c. &c. &c. In short the Father was quite up to the occasion, which is saying a great deal."    Back in 1979, the Holy Father wrote a  urlLink letter  to the Archbishop of Birmingham,commemerating the centenary of this event.

Wherefore also all gave one name to the Church, not their own, but that of their Lord Jesus Christ, since they began to be called Christians first at Antioch; which is the Sole Catholic Church, having nought else but Christ's, being a Church of Christians; not of Christs, but of Christians, He being One, they from that One being called Christians.

       On May 11, 1851  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive. (This is one that I really wish had been written down !)  Oratory of Brothers On the General Scope of the Institute   "1. INTROD.-Perhaps some of you do not know what it is we are offering you in this association.  2. In one word, which, vague as it is, still is true, we are meeting together to do something towards saving our souls.  3. Difficulty of saving the soul. St. Philip's saying that no one could be expected to get to heaven who had not feared hell. Scripture texts, 'narrow is the way,' etc.  4. Grace most abundant. Till the last day, we shall not know how much.  5. But there is a most unaccountable waywardness in man. It is needless to speculate on it. Every one feels it. He cannot steady, command, direct himselfinefficacious desires. He is beaten about here and there at the mercy of the waves. Sloth, cowardice, anger, fretfulness, sullenness, vanity, curiosity, concupiscence, ever lead him astray.  6. Hence all serious men look out for a rule of life to defend them against themselves.   7. This leads many into religion for assistance, for sympathy, for guidance.  8. The Oratorium Parvum is a slight bond of sympathy and of mutual assistance.  9. Hence it matters not what we do, or whether you have anything definite in it beyond this end, if you secure it. "  He was encouraging membership in the  Oratorium Parvum - the Little, or Secular, Oratory. Hence my frustration over only having these sketchy notes !

       May 11,1926....   was the day J.R.R. Tolkien met C.S. Lewis, at an English Faculty Tea held at Merton College, Oxford. While they did not hit it off immediately, the friendship that they later developed was to have profound spiritual and literary consequences.   "Lewis was a very impressionable man, and this was abetted by his great generosity and capacity for friendship. The unpayable debt I owe to him was not 'influence' as it is commonly understood, but sheer encouragement. He was for long my only audience. Only from him did I ever get the idea that my 'stuff' could be more than a private hobby. But for his interest and unceasing eagerness for more, I should never have brought   the L. of the R.  to a conclusion. " -J.R.R. Tolkien to Dick Plotz of the Tolkien Society of America, September 12, 1965

       For all the mothers out there....   urlLink " Mary's 'hidden life' is example to mothers"- Pope John Paul II- General Audience, January 29, 1997   " In Jesus Christ is the fulness of the Godhead with all its infinite sanctity. In Mary is reflected the sanctity of Jesus, as by His grace it could be found in a creature.  Mary, as the pattern both of maidenhood and maternity, has exalted womans state and nature, and made the Christian virgin and the Christian mother understand the sacredness of their duties in the sight of God.  Her very image is as a book in which we may read at a glance the mystery of the Incarnation, and the mercy of the Redemption; and withal her own gracious perfections also, who was made by her Divine Son the very type of humility, gentleness, fortitude, purity, patience, love.  What Christian mother can look upon her image and not be moved to pray for gentleness, watchfulness, and obedience like Marys? What Christian maiden can look upon her without praying for the gifts of simplicity, modesty, purity, recollection, gentleness such as hers?  Who can repeat her very name without finding in it a music which goes to the heart, and brings before him thoughts of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven above, and fills him with the desire of those graces by which heaven is gained?  Hail then, great Mother of God, Queen of Saints, Royal Lady clothed with the sun and crowned with the stars of heaven, whom all generations have called and shall call blessed. We will take our part in praising thee in our own time and place with all the redeemed of our Lord, and will exalt thee in the full assembly of the saints and glorify thee in the Heavenly Jerusalem.

       From the folks at  urlLink Zenit    Why Miracles Are Required for Canonizations  Aide With Congregation for Sainthood Causes Explains   " VATICAN CITY, MAY 7, 2004 (Zenit.org).- The requirement of miracles in the causes of canonization are crucial because they are a divine confirmation of the holiness of the person invoked, says a Vatican aide.   Monsignor Michele Di Ruberto, the undersecretary of the Congregation for Sainthood Causes, has spent 35 years in the dicastery and for the past two decades has been part of the Medical Consultation, which is crucial for the verification of miracles.   The monsignor was relator of the cause of Gianna Beretta Molla, whom John Paul II will canonize on May 16 with five other people.   To prove the authenticity of a miraculous event means going through the process of meticulous scientific and theological examination, Monsignor Di Ruberto said in an interview with the Italian magazine 30 Giorni.   'For the beatification of a servant of God who is not a martyr, the Church requires a miracle; for canonization, including that of a martyr, it requires another,' he explained. 'Only the presumed miracles attributed to the intercession of a servant of God or of a blessed "post mortem" can be the object of verification.'   A miracle is an 'event that goes beyond the forces of nature, which is realized by God outside of what is normal in the whole of created nature by the intercession of a servant of God or a blessed,' Monsignor Di Ruberto said.   The investigation of a miracle is carried out separately from that of virtues or martyrdom.   The process of recognizing a miracle has two stages. The first is in the diocesan realm where the miraculous event took place; here, eyewitnesses' statements and documentation and other material are collected. In the second, the Vatican congregation examines all the material collected.   To declare someone's holiness is not like conferring an honorary title.   Even 'if someone is in heaven, it might be that they are not worthy of public devotion,' Monsignor Di Ruberto explained.   Moreover, the process of establishing 'heroic virtues, through all the work of collecting testimonials and documentaries as proofs' and of 'theological assessments' until arriving at 'moral certainty and the formulation of a judgment,' even if well-founded, serious and precise, is not exempt from possible errors, he said.   'We can make mistakes, deceive ourselves,' said the undersecretary. 'Miracles, instead, can only be realized by God, and God does not deceive.'  Miracles are a 'sure sign of revelation, destined to glorify God, to awaken and reinforce our faith, and, therefore, they are also a confirmation of the holiness of the person invoked,' the monsignor said.   Consequently, the recognition of a miracle 'makes it possible to grant with certainty permission for devotion,' he added. Hence, the 'capital importance of keeping miracles as a requirement in the causes of canonization.'   A collegial body made up of five medical specialists and two professional experts form the Medical Consultation, in charge of the scientific examination of the presumed miracle. Their judgment is of a 'strictly scientific' character, so their being 'atheists or of other religions is not relevant,' Monsignor Di Ruberto emphasized.   'Their examination and final discussion are concluded by precisely establishing the diagnosis of the illness, the prognosis, the treatment and its solution,' he continued. 'To be considered the object of a possible miracle, the cure must be judged by the specialists to have been rapid, complete, lasting and inexplicable, according to present medical-scientific knowledge.'   The miracle might go beyond the capacities of nature in regard to the substance or the subject of the event, or the way it occurred.   So a distinction is made of three great miracles: the resurrection of the dead; the complete cure -- which might entail the reconstruction of organs -- of a person judged incurable; or the curing of an illness -- which could be cured over time but takes place instantly.   'If there are uncertainties, the consultation suspends the evaluation and asks for more experts or documentation,' Monsignor Di Ruberto said. 'Once there is a majority or unanimity in the voting, the examination is sent to the theologians' consultation.'   Starting with the conclusions of the Medical Consultation, the theologians 'are called to identify the nexus of causality between prayer to the Servant of God and an inexplicable cure or technical success, and they express the judgment that the prodigious event is a real miracle.'   'When the theologians have also expressed their vote in writing, the assessment is sent to the Congregation for Bishops and cardinals who, after hearing the exposé of a "speaker", discuss all the elements of the miracle,' the monsignor said. 'Each component, therefore, gives his judgment, which must be submitted for the approval of the Pope.'   Finally, it is the Holy Father who 'determines the miracle and decides on the promulgation of the decree,' the monsignor said. The latter is a juridical act of the Congregation for Sainthood Causes, sanctioned by the Pope, 'by which a prodigious event is defined as a genuine miracle,' he concluded. "  Therefore, I offer the following for the use of all those who wish to see Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., raised to the honors of the altar:   Eternal Father, You led JOHN HENRY NEWMAN to follow the kindly light of Truth, and he obediently responded to your heavenly calls at any cost. As writer, preacher, counsellor and educator, as pastor, Oratorian, and servant of the poor he laboured to build up Your Kingdom.  Grant that through your Vicar on Earth we may hear the words, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter into the company of the canonized saints."  May You manifest Your servant's power of intercession by even extraordinary answers to the prayers of the faithful throughout the world. We pray particularly for our intentions in his name and in the Name of Jesus Christ Your Son our Lord.  Amen.

       On May 9, 1850...  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., delivered the first of a series of lectures which were eventually published as  urlLink  Certain Difficulties Felt by Anglicans in Catholic Teaching, Volume 1    Here is a little sample:  "And my confidence that you will do so at last, and that the sophistries of this world will not hold you for ever, is what has caused the hesitation to which I have referred, whether I have done wisely in deciding on addressing you at all. I have in truth had anxious misgivings whether I should not do better to let you alone, my own experience teaching me, that even the most charitable attempts are apt to fail, when their end is the conviction of the intellect. It is no work of a day to convince the intellect of an Englishman that Catholicism is true. And even when the intellect is convinced, a thousand subtle influences interpose in arrest of what should follow, carrying, as it were, an appeal into a higher court, and claiming to have the matter settled before some tribunal more sacred, and by pleadings more recondite, than the operations and the decision of the reason. The Eternal God deals with us one by one, each in his own way; and bystanders may pity and compassionate the long throes of our travail, but they cannot aid us except by their prayers. If, then, I have erred in entering upon the subjects I have brought before you, pardon me; pardon me if I have rudely taken on myself to thrust you forward, and to anticipate by artificial means a divine growth. If it be so, I will only hope that, though I may have done you no good, yet my attempt may be blessed in some other way; that I may have thrown light on the general subject which I have discussed, have contributed to map out the field of thought on which I have been engaged, and to ascertain its lie and its characteristics, and have furnished materials for what, in time to come, may be the science and received principles of the whole controversy, though I have failed in that which was my immediate object.  At all events, my dear brethren, I hope I may be at least considered to be showing my goodwill and kindness towards you, if nothing else, and my desire to be of use to you. All is vanity but what is done to the glory of God. It glitters and it fades away; it makes a noise and is gone. If I shall not do you or others good, I have done nothing. Yet a little while and the end will come, and all will be made manifest, and error will fail, and truth will prevail. Yet a little while, and 'the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.' May you and I live in this prospect; and may the Eternal God, Father, Son, and Spirit, Three in One, may His Ever-blessed Mother, may St. Philip, my dear father and master, the great Saints Athanasius and Ambrose, and St. Leo, pope and confessor, who have brought me thus far, be the hope, and help, and reward of you and me, all through this weary life, and in the day of account, and in glory everlasting!

       Four days ....  until St. Philip's Day !   Philip's Cheerfulness  by Venerable John Henry Newman,C.O.  "Philip welcomed those who consulted him with singular benignity, and received them, though strangers, with as much affection as if he had been a long time expecting them. When he was called upon to be merry, he was merry; when he was called upon to feel sympathy with the distressed, he was equally ready.  Sometimes he left his prayers and went down to sport and banter with young men, and by this sweetness and condescension and playful conversation gained their souls.  He could not bear anyone to be downcast or pensive, because spirituality is always injured by it; but when he saw anyone grave and gloomy, he used to say, 'Be merry.' He had a particular and marked leaning to cheerful persons.  At the same time he was a great enemy to anything like rudeness or foolery; for a buffooning spirit not only does not advance in religion, but roots out even what is already there.   One day he restored cheerfulness to Father Francesco Bernardi, of the Congregation, by simply asking him to run with him, saying, 'Come now, let us have a run together.'  His penitents felt that joy at being in his room that they used to say, Philip's room is not a room, but an earthly Paradise.  To others, to merely stand at the door of his room, without going in, was a release from all their troubles. Others recovered their lost peace of mind by simply looking Philip in the face. To dream of him was enough to comfort many. In a word, Philip was a perpetual refreshment to all those who were in perplexity and sadness.  No one ever saw Philip melancholy; those who went to him always found him with a cheerful and smiling countenance, yet mixed with gravity.  When he was ill he did not so much receive as impart consolation. He was never heard to change his voice, as invalids generally do, but spoke in the same sonorous tone as when he was well. Once, when the physicians had given him over, he said, with the Psalmist, ' Paratus sum et non sum turbatus ' ('I am ready, and am not troubled'). He received Extreme Unction four times, but with the same calm and joyous countenance.   Prayer  Philip, my glorious Advocate, who didst ever follow the precepts and example of the Apostle St. Paul in rejoicing always in all things, gain for me the grace of perfect resignation to God's will, of indifference to matters of this world, and a constant sight of Heaven; so that I may never be disappointed at the Divine providences, never desponding, never sad, never fretful; that my countenance may always be open and cheerful, and my words kind and pleasant, as becomes those who, in whatever state of life they are, have the greatest of all goods, the favour of God and the prospect of eternal bliss."

       Five days  until St. Philip's Day !   Philip's Tenderness of Heart  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Philip could not endure the very sight of suffering; and though he abhorred riches, he always wished to have money to give in alms.  He could not bear to see children scantily clothed, and did all he could to get new clothes for them.  Oppressed and suffering innocence troubled him especially; when a Roman gentleman was falsely accused of having been the death of a man, and was imprisoned, he went so far as to put his cause before the Pope, and obtained his liberation.  A priest was accused by some powerful persons, and was likely to suffer in consequence. Philip took up his cause with such warmth that he established his innocence before the public.  Another time, hearing of some gipsies who had been unjustly condemned to hard labour, he went to the Pope, and procured their freedom. His love of justice was as great as his tenderness and compassion.  Soon after he became a Priest there was a severe famine in Rome, and six loaves were sent to him as a present. Knowing that there was in the same house a poor foreigner suffering from want of food, he gave them all to him, and had for the first day nothing but olives to eat.  Philip had a special tenderness towards artisans, and those who had a difficulty of selling their goods. There were two watchmakers, skilful artists, but old and burdened with large families. He gave them a large order for watches, and contrived to sell them among his friends.  His zeal and liberality specially shone forth towards poor girls. He provided for them when they had no other means of provision. He found marriage dowries for some of them; to others he gave what was sufficient to gain their admittance into convents.  He was particularly good to prisoners, to whom he sent money several times in the week.  He set no limits to his affection for the shrinking and bashful poor, and was more liberal in his alms towards them.  Poor students were another object of his special compassion; he provided them not only with food and clothing, but also with books for their studies. To aid one of them he sold all his own books.  He felt most keenly any kindness done to him, so that one of his friends said: 'You could not make Philip a present without receiving another from him of double value.'  He was very tender towards brute animals. Seeing someone put his foot on a lizard, he cried out, 'Cruel fellow! what has that poor animal done to you?'  Seeing a butcher wound a dog with one of his knives, he could not contain himself, and had great difficulty in keeping himself cool.  He could not bear the slightest cruelty to be shown to brute animals under any pretext whatever. If a bird came into the room, he would have the window opened that it might not be caught.   Prayer  Philip, my glorious Advocate, teach me to look at all I see around me after thy pattern as the creatures of God. Let me never forget that the same God who made me made the whole world, and all men and all animals that are in it. Gain me the grace to love all God's works for God's sake, and all men for the sake of my Lord and Saviour who has redeemed them by the Cross. And especially let me be tender and compassionate and loving towards all Christians, as my brethren in grace. And do thou, who on earth was so tender to all, be especially tender to us, and feel for us, bear with us in all our troubles, and gain for us from God, with whom thou dwellest in beatific light, all the aids necessary for bringing us safely to Him and to thee."

       Six days...  until St. Philip's Day !   Philip's Purity  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Philip well knowing the pleasure which God takes in cleanness of heart, had no sooner come to years of discretion, and to the power of distinguishing between good and evil, than he set himself to wage war against the evils and suggestions of his enemy, and never rested till he had gained the victory. Thus, notwithstanding he lived in the world when young, and met with all kinds of persons, he preserved his virginity spotless in those dangerous years of his life.  No word was ever heard from his lips which would offend the most severe modesty, and in his dress, his carriage, and countenance, he manifested the same beautiful virtue.  One day, while he was yet a layman, some profligate persons impudently tempted him to commit sin. When he saw that flight was impossible, he began to speak to them of the hideousness of sin and the awful presence of God. This he did with such manifest distress, such earnestness, and such fervour,that his words pierced their abandoned hearts as a sword, and not only persuaded them to give up their horrible thought, but even reclaimed them from their evil ways.  At another time some bad men, who are accustomed to think no one better than themselves, invited him on some pretext into their house, under the belief that he was not what the world took him to be; and then, having got possession of him, thrust him into a great temptation. Philip, in this strait, finding the doors locked, knelt down and began to pray to God with such astonishing fervour and heartfelt heavenly eloquence, that the two poor wretches who were in the room did not dare to speak to him, and at last themselves left him and gave him a way to escape.  His virginal purity shone out of his countenance. His eyes were so clear and bright, even to the last years of his life, that no painter ever succeeded in giving the expression of them, and it was not easy for anyone to keep looking on him for any length of time, for he dazzled them like an Angel of Paradise.  Moreover, his body, even in his old age, emitted a fragrance which, even in his decrepit old age, refreshed those who came near him; and many said that they felt devotion infused into them by the mere smell of his hands.  As to the opposite vice. The ill odour of it was not to the Saint a mere figure of speech, but a reality, so that he could detect those whose souls were blackened by it; and he used to say that it was so horrible that nothing in the world could equal it, nothing, in short, but the Evil Spirit himself. Before his penitents began their confession he sometimes said, 'O my son, I know your sins already.'  Many confessed that they were at once delivered from temptations by his merely laying his hands on their heads. The very mention of his name had a power of shielding from Satan those who were assailed by his fiery darts.  He exhorted men never to trust themselves, whatever experience they might have of themselves, or however long their habits of virtue.  He used to say that humility was the true guard of chastity; and that not to have pity for another in such cases was a forerunner of a speedy fall in ourselves; and that when he found a man censorious, and secure of himself, and without fear, he gave him up for lost.   Prayer  Philip, my glorious Patron, who didst ever keep unsullied the white lily of thy purity, with such jealous care that the majesty of this fair virtue beamed from thine eyes, shone in thy hands, and was fragrant in thy breath, obtain for me that gift from the Holy Ghost, that neither the words nor the example of sinners may ever make any impression on my soul. And, since it is by avoiding occasions of sin, by prayer, by keeping myself employed, and by the frequent use of the Sacraments that my dread enemy must be subdued, gain for me the grace to persevere in these necessary observances."

       The May  First Things   is  urlLink online.   Among other excellent articles, there's this relatively short one by Fr. Richard John Neuhaus. "David Horowitz is pressing a proposal that has thrown many academics into a tizzy. He wants universities to adopt an Academic Bill of Rights that will assure, amidst a multitude of other diversities, 'intellectual diversity.' Everybody in the academy is fervently devoted to diversity, until you put 'intellectual' in front of the word. The eminent and self-described sophist Stanley Fish does not like the Horowitz proposal one little bit. It is, he says, a 'Trojan horse of a dark design' to infiltrate conservatives into positions of academic influence. On campuses, says Fish, the culture wars are being won by those who promote womens studies, Latino studies, African-American studies, postmodern studies, gay-lesbian-transgender studies, and the like. But their critics have won the war of public opinion, convincing Americans that 'our colleges and universities are hotbeds (what is a "hotbed" anyway?) of radicalism and pedagogical irresponsibility where dollars are wasted, nonsense is propagated, students are indoctrinated, religion is disrespected, and patriotism is scorned.' Horowitzs Academic Bill of Rights, Fish declares, would inaugurate the oppressive rule of ideological 'balance' when the only purpose of a university is 'to seek the truth.' It is hard to know what to make of Fishs protest. In other writings, he is scornfully dismissive of the idea that there is such a thing as 'the truth.' Maybe it is just that Fish likes the academys domination by insouciant nihilisms and doesnt want to see that challenged. Of course Horowitz is a conservative and would like to see more people in the academy challenging the likes of Fish. His proposal is a very odd Trojan horse, however, since no secret is made of its intent. Stanley Fish, sophist that he is, is never happier than when people say it is hard to know what to make of what he says. As for the meaning of 'hotbed,' I trust that Professor Fish is not above resorting to a dictionary where it is defined as 'a bed of soil heated by fermenting manure.' "

       The Solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord  is today.There is information on it  urlLink here . (And BTW, my diocese still celebrates it on the proper day !)   Ascendit in Caelum He ascended into Heaven   "1. My Lord is gone up into heaven. I adore Thee, Son of Mary, Jesu Emmanuel, my God and my Saviour. I am allowed to adore Thee, my Saviour and my own Brother, for Thou art God. I follow Thee in my thoughts, O Thou First fruits of our race, as I hope one day by Thy grace to follow Thee in my person. To go to heaven is to go to God. God is there and God alone: for perfect bliss is there and nothing else, and none can be blessed who is not bathed and hidden and absorbed in the glory of the Divine Nature. All holy creatures are but the vestment of the Highest, which He has put on for ever, and which is bright with His uncreated light. There are many things on earth, and each isits own centre, but one Name alone is named above. It is God alone. This is that true supernatural life; and if I would live a supernatural life on earth, and attain to the supernatural eternal life which is in heaven, I have one thing to do, viz. to live on the thought of God here. Teach me this, O God; give me Thy supernatural grace to practise it; to have my reason, affections, intentions, aims, all penetrated and possessed by the love of Thee, plunged and drowned in the one Vision of Thee.  2. There is but one Name and one Thought above: there are many thoughts below. This is the earthly life, which leads to death, viz. to follow the numberless objects and aims and toils and amusements which men pursue on earth. Even the good that is here below does not lead to heaven; it is spoilt in the handselling; it perishes in the using; it has no stay, no integrity, no consistency. It runs off into evil before it has well ceased, before it has well begun to be good. It is at best vanity, when it is nothing worse. It has in it commonly the seeds of real sin. My God, I acknowledge all this. My Lord Jesu, I confess and know that Thou only art the True, the Beautiful, and the Good. Thou alone canst make me bright and glorious, and canst lead me up after Thee. Thou art the way, the truth, and the life, and none but Thou. Earth will never lead me to heaven. Thou alone art the Way; Thou alone.  3. My God, shall I for one moment doubt where my path lies? Shall I not at once take Thee for my portion? To whom should I go? Thou hast the words of Eternal Life. Thou camest down for the very purpose of doing that which no one here below could do for me. None but He who is in heaven can bring me to heaven. What strength have I to scale the high mountain? Though I served the world ever so well, though I did my duty in it (as men speak), what could the world do for me, however hard it tried? Though I filled my station well, did good to my fellows, had a fair name or a wide reputation, though I did great deeds and was celebrated, though I had the praise of history, how would all this bring me to heaven? I choose Thee then for my One Portion, because Thou livest and diest not. I cast away all idols. I give myself to  Thee . I pray Thee to teach me, guide me, enable me, and receive me to Thee."- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Meditations and Devotions   If it were not a Solemnity, today would be the feast of  urlLink St. Bernadine of Siena, O.F.M., Priest . While this biography doesn't mention it, I'm rather fond of an incident that occurred when this saint was a young layman. A man made the mistake of attempting to seduce him to commit an unnatural act. The saint's response was to deck him. (Of course, now he would undoubtedly end up in jail for that. "Hate crime", you know...)

       The Granola Conservative  posts a  urlLink letter  from one of the Fathers of the London Oratory to a certain notorious profiligate. Since said profiligate chickened out on their next meeting, it seems that Father had hit a little too close to the bone. Many years later, he came into the Church on his deathbed, but how much better it would have been for him if he had listened earlier !

       One week...  until St. Philip's Day ! And the Novena continues...  Philip's Exercise of Prayer  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "From very boyhood the servant of God gave himself up to prayer, until he acquired such a habit of it, that, wherever he was, his mind was always lifted up to heavenly things.  Sometimes he forgot to eat; sometimes, when he was dressing, he left off, being carried away in his thought to heaven, with his eyes open, yet abstracted from all things around him.  It was easier for Philip to think upon God, than for men of the world to think of the world.  If anyone entered his room suddenly, he would most probably find him so rapt in prayer, that, when spoken to, he did not give the right answer, and had to take a turn or two up and down the room before he fully came to himself.  If he gave way to his habit of prayer in the most trifling degree, he immediately became lost in contemplation.  It was necessary to distract him lest this continual stretch of mind should be prejudicial to his health.  Before transacting business, however trivial, he always prayed; when asked a question, he never answered till he had recollected himself.  He began praying when he went to bed, and as soon as he awoke, and he did not usually sleep more than four, or at the most five hours.  Sometimes, if anyone showed that he had observed that Philip went to bed late or rose early in order to pray, he would answer, 'Paradise is not made for sluggards.'  He was more than ordinarily intent on prayer at the more solemn feasts, or at a time of urgent spiritual necessities; above all, in Holy Week.  Those who could not make long meditations he advised to lift up their minds repeatedly to God in ejaculatory prayers, as 'Jesus, increase my faith,' 'Jesus, grant that I may never offend Thee.'  Philip introduced family prayer into many of the principal houses of Rome.  When one of his penitents asked him to teach him how to pray, he answered, 'Be humble and obedient, and the Holy Ghost will teach you.'  He had a special devotion for the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity, and daily poured out before Him most fervent prayers for gifts and graces.  Once, when he was passing the night in prayer in the Catacombs, that great miracle took place of the Divine presence of the Holy Ghost descending upon him under the appearance of a ball of fire, entering into his mouth and lodging in his breast, from which time he had a supernatural palpitation of the heart.  He used to say that when our prayers are in the way of being granted, we must not leave off, but pray as fervently as before.  He especially recommended beginners to meditate on the four last things, and used to say that he who does not in his thoughts and fears go down to hell in his lifetime, runs a great risk of going there when he dies.  When he wished to show the necessity of prayer, he said that a man without prayer was an animal without reason.  Many of his disciples improved greatly in this exercisenot religious only, but secular persons, artisans, merchants, physicians, lawyers, and courtiersand became such men of prayer as to receive extraordinary favours from God.   Prayer  Philip, my holy Patron, teach me by thy example, and gain for me by thy intercessions, to seek my Lord and God at all times and in all places, and to live in His presence and in sacred intercourse with Him. As the children of this world look up to rich men or men in station for the favour which they desire, so may I ever lift up my eyes and hands and heart towards heaven, and betake myself to the Source of all good for those goods which I need. As the children of this world converse with their friends and find their pleasure in them, so may I ever hold communion with Saints and Angels, and with the Blessed Virgin, the Mother of my Lord. Pray with me, O Philip, as thou didst pray with thy penitents here below, and then prayer will become sweet to me, as it did to them."

       On May 18, 1851  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  On the World Hating the Catholic Church   "1. INTROD. In the discourse of which the gospel is part, our Lord speaks of the world hating us.  2. This remarkable, viz. that we should be hated. That the Catholic faith is difficult and a stumbling-block is intelligiblebut hateful! Difficult to realise, for we are drawn to all, and cannot believe they hate us.  3. Consider its beautyacknowledged by intellectual menof its services; of its rites; of its majesty; doctrine of our lady, etc., etc. Its connection with art, etc., etc. Paley on Romans xii., in Evidences.  4. Yet so our Lord has saidquote John xv. 18-19 ,John xvii. 14 , and 1 John iii. 1 . 'Wonder not if the world hate you.'  5. And what is remarkable further, it is a prophecy. It has been fulfilled and is fulfilled to this day; it is literal honest hate. The world is not merely deceived; it has an instinct, and hates.  6. But more than this, or again, it is a note of the Church in every age; in the Middle Ages, when religion was established as much as now.  7. And none but the Church thus hated. So that our Lord's prophecy falls on us, and connects us with the apostles.  8. Others, indeed, by an accident and for a time.  9. For sects have (1) something true and good in them; (2) are extravagant; and these two things make them persecuted.  10. But it is for a time. The truth goes off, and the extravagancethey tame down; thus the Methodists and the Quakers.  11. But Catholics, nothing of thissoberby token men of the world get on with us.  12. Yet the suspicion, irritability, impatience, etc., etc.-Demoniacs, and it is the devil's work.  13. This must not make us misanthropic, but cast us on the unseen world and purify our motives. This one benefit of the present agitation. "  The "present agitation" was the  urlLink so-called Papal Aggression"  You see, Pope Pius IX had actually dared to re-establish a hierarchy of Catholic Bishops in England, and this brought the 'anti-Papist' bigots out in full force- demonstrations, public burnings-in-effigy of the Pope and the new Bishops, vicious insults in the press and public places (an Anglican clergyman stated from the pulpit that hearing confessions ought to be made a capital crime), attacks on Catholic churches and other buildings (someone tried to set fire to the London Oratory by putting firecrackers on its roof) and abuse hurled at any Catholic recognized as such- but particularly priests and religious. The Venerable responded to the uproar with  urlLink Lectures on the Present Position of Catholics in England . Here is a sample: "What a remarkable illustration have Protestants supplied to this doctrine of a Protestant divine since Michaelmas last! The special champions of toleration, the jealous foes of persecution, how studiously and conscientiously, during nine long months, have they practised what they preached! What a bright example have they set to that religious communion which they hold in such abhorrence on the ground of its persecuting spirit! Oh, the one-sided intellect of Protestantism! I appeal in evidence of it to a great banquet, where, amid great applause, the first judge of the land spoke of trampling Cardinal Wiseman's hat under his feet. I appeal to the last fifth of November, when jeers against the Blessed Sacrament and its rites were chalked up in the Metropolis with impunity, under the very shadow of the Court, and before the eyes of the Home Office and the Police. I appeal to the mock processions to ridicule, and bonfires to burn, what we hold most venerable and sacred, not only Pope, and Cardinal and Priest, but the very Mother of our Lord, and the Crucifix itself. I appeal to those ever-growing files of newspapers, whose daily task, in the tedious succession of months has been to cater for the gross palate of their readers all varieties of disgusting gossip, and of bitter reproach, and of extravagant slander, and of affronting, taunting, sneering, irritating invective against us. I appeal to the buckram nuns of Warwickshire, Nottingham, and Clapham, to the dungeons of Edgbaston, and the sin-table of St. Gudule's. I appeal to the outrageous language perpetrated in a place I must not name, where one speaker went the length of saying, what the reporters suppressed for fear of consequences, that a dear friend and brother of mine, for whose purity and honour I would die, mentioning him by name, went about the country, as the words came to the ears of those present, seducing young women. I appeal to the weekly caricatures, not of persons only and their doings, but of all that is held sacred in our doctrines and observances, of our rites and ceremonies, our saints and our relics, our sacred vestments and our rosaries. I appeal to the popular publication, which witty and amusing in its place, thought it well to leave its 'sweetness' and its 'fatness,' to change make-believe for earnest, to become solemn and sour in its jests, and awkwardly to try its hand at divinity, because Catholics were the game. I appeal to the cowardly issue of a cowardly agitation, to the blows dealt in the streets of this very town upon the persons of the innocent, the tender, and the helpless;not to any insult or affliction which has come upon ourselves, for it is our portion, and we have no thought of complaining,but to the ladies and the schoolgirls, who, at various times, up to the day I am recording it, because they are Catholics, have been the victims of these newspaper sarcasms, and these platform blasphemies. I appeal to the stones striking sharply upon the one, and the teeth knocked out of the mouths of the other. Dr. Whately's words have been almost prophetic; mockery and insult have literally terminated in the bodily injury of those non-belligerents, who are sacred by the laws of all civilised warfare. Such are some of the phenomena of a Religion which makes it its special boast to be the Prophet of Toleration."

        Eight days  until St. Philip's Day !  Philip's Devotion  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "The inward flame of devotion in Philip was so intense that he sometimes fainted in consequence of it, or was forced to throw himself upon his bed, under the sickness of divine love.  When he was young he sometimes felt this divine fervour so vehemently as to be unable to contain himself, throwing himself as if in agony on the ground and crying out, 'No more, Lord, no more.'  What St. Paul says of himself seemed to be fulfilled in Philip: 'I am filled with consolation-I over-abound with joy.'  Yet, though he enjoyed sweetnesses, he used to say that he wished to serve God, not out of interestthat is, because there was pleasure in itbut out of pure love, even though he felt no gratification in loving Him.  When he was a layman, he communicated every morning. When he was old, he had frequent ecstacies during his Mass.  Hence it is customary in pictures of Philip to paint him in red vestments, to record his ardent desire to shed his blood for the love of Christ.  He was so devoted to his Lord and Saviour that he was always pronouncing the name of Jesus with unspeakable sweetness. He had also an extraordinary pleasure in saying the Creed, and he was so fond of the 'Our Father' that he lingered on each petition in such a way that it seemed as if he never would get through them.  He had such a devotion to the Blessed Sacrament that, when he was ill, he could not sleep till he had communicated.  When he was reading or meditating on the Passion he was seen to turn as pale as ashes, and his eyes filled with tears.  Once when he was ill, they brought him something to drink. He took the glass in his hand, and when he was putting it to his mouth stopped, and began to weep most bitterly. He cried out, 'Thou, my Christ, Thou upon the Cross wast thirsty, and they gave Thee nothing but gall and vinegar to drink; and I am in bed, with so many comforts around me, and so many persons to attend to me.'  Yet Philip did not make much account of this warmth and acuteness of feeling; for he said that Emotion was not Devotion, that tears were no sign that a man was in the grace of God, neither must we suppose a man holy merely because he weeps when he speaks of religion.  Philip was so devoted to the Blessed Virgin that he had her name continually in his mouth. He had two ejaculations in her honour. One, 'Virgin Mary, Mother of God, pray to Jesus for me.' The other, simply 'Virgin Mother,' for he said that in those two words all possible praises of Mary are contained.  He had also a singular devotion to St. Mary Magdalen, on whose vigil he was born, and for the Apostles St. James and St. Philip; also for St. Paul the Apostle, and for St. Thomas of Aquinum, Doctor of the Church.   Prayer  Philip, my glorious Patron, gain for me a portion of that gift which thou hadst so abundantly. Alas! thy heart was burning with love; mine is all frozen towards God, and alive only for creatures. I love the world, which can never make me happy; my highest desire is to be well off here below. O my God, when shall I learn to love nothing else but Thee? Gain for me, O Philip, a pure love, a strong love, and an efficacious love, that, loving God here upon earth, I may enjoy the sight of Him, together with thee and all saints, hereafter in heaven."

       Nine days....  until St. Philip's Day ! I herewith begin the St. Philip Neri Novena:  Philip's Humility  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "If Philip heard of anyone having committed a crime, he would say, 'Thank God that I have not done worse.'  At confession he would shed abundance of tears, and say, 'I have never done a good action.'  When a penitent showed that she could not bear the rudeness shown towards him by certain persons who were under great obligations to him, he answered her, 'If I were humble, God would not send this to me.'  When one of his spiritual children said to him, 'Father, I wish to have something of yours for devotion, for I know you are a Saint,' he turned to her with a face full of anger, and broke out into these words: 'Begone with you! I am a devil, and not a saint.'  To another who said to him, 'Father, a temptation has come to me to think that you are not what the world takes you for,' he made answer: 'Be sure of this, that I am a man like my neighbours, and nothing more.'  If he heard of any who had a good opinion of him, he used to say, 'O poor me! how many poor girls will be greater in Paradise than I shall be!'  He avoided all marks of honour. He could not bear to receive any signs of respect. When people wished to touch his clothes, and knelt as he passed by, he used to say, 'Get up! get out of my way!' He did not like people to kiss his hand; though he sometimes let them do so, lest he should hurt their feelings.  He was an enemy to all rivalry and contention. He always took in good part everything that was said to him. He had a particular dislike of affectation, whether in speaking, or in dressing, or in anything else.  He could not bear two-faced persons; as for liars, he could not endure them, and was continually reminding his spiritual children to avoid them as they would a pestilence.  He always asked advice, even on affairs of minor importance. His constant counsel to his penitents was, that they should not trust in themselves, but always take the advice of others, and get as many prayers as they could.  He took great pleasure in being lightly esteemed, nay, even despised.  He had a most pleasant manner of transacting business with others, great sweetness in conversation, and was full of compassion and consideration.   He had always a dislike to speak of himself. The phrases 'I said,' 'I did,' were rarely in his mouth. He exhorted others never to make a display of themselves, especially in those things which tended to their credit, whether in earnest or in joke.  As St. John the Evangelist, when old, was continually saying, 'Little children, love one another,' so Philip was ever repeating his favourite lesson, 'Be humble; think little of yourselves.'  He said that if we did a good work, and another took the credit of it to himself, we ought to rejoice and thank God.  He said no one ought to say, 'Oh! I shall not fall, I shall not commit sin,' for it was a clear sign that he would fall. He was greatly displeased with those who made excuses for themselves, and called such persons. 'My Lady Eve,' because Eve defended herself instead of being humble.   Prayer  Philip, my glorious patron, who didst count as dross the praise, and even the good esteem of men, obtain for me also, from my Lord and Saviour, this fair virtue by thy prayers. How haughty are my thoughts, how contemptuous are my words, how ambitious are my works. Gain for me that low esteem of self with which thou wast gifted; obtain for me a knowledge of my own nothingness, that I may rejoice when I am despised, and ever seek to be great only in the eyes of my God and Judge."

       On May 16, 1875  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., was in the midst of a  urlLink  epistolary debate on history and theology   with one of his nephews. However, the letter he sent that day was much shorter than usual....  "MY DEAR JOHN, I am very glad to have so long a letter from you, but you must let me wait, and be patient with me, as to my answering it, for I have received a very heavy blow in the sudden and alarming illness of the greatest friend I have-an illness, the issue of which will take some time to show itself, and which has almost turned my head.  Thank E- for wishing to send me, and you for sending, her love-and tell her that I am very grateful to her, and send her a double measure in return-one in reciprocity, and one from gratitude.  Yours affectionately, JOHN H. NEWMAN "  The one who was ill was  urlLink Fr. Ambrose St. John, C.O.  , who had been the Venerable's closest friend for more than 30 years. He died on the eve of St. Philip's Day- a terrible blow to Newman, who had naturally expected that Fr. Ambrose, being considerably younger, would outlive him. As he later wrote to another friend: "You refer to St. John's age. Yes, I often think, can it be God's will that, as the beloved disciple outlived all his brethren, I too am to have a portion of that special cross of his? Dear Mrs. Poncia, who went so unexpectedly two years ago, used to say on this day to me 'Many, many returns of it': I used to answer, 'You don't wish me to outlive you all'and she answered, 'Yes, till 90 or 100 years'-Then I said, 'O how cruel!'  Of late I have often thought whether it was God's will that I should have the trial of seeing those I loved die before mebut it was a very ungrateful thought to be suggested to me by God's great mercy in keeping me so well in health. Was it not enough to provoke Him to visit me with sickness and suffering? Well, I am in His Handsand I can but repeat what I found among dear Father Ambrose's morning prayers, 'Do with me what Thou wilt; I shall ever be in peace if I live and die in Thy love.'  May God be with you also as He has been with me; not only for 25 years, but, as He has been with you for so long a time, so also to the endand with me too, till we all meet in the bosom of our God."

       I'm currently reading...  a very interesting book... Tolkien and the Great War , by John Garth. It's a detailed biographical look at the Professor's early life, concentrating on the time he spent as a soldier in WWI and the periods immediately preceding and following that time. The prologue deals with a innocent pursuit- the rugby game he and other recent alums of King Edward's School,following school tradtion,played against the current school squad in 1913. After the recounting of this bit of hard-fought fun, the last three paragraphs hit this reader particularly hard.  "There is dinner with old friends tonight, and the TCBS (ed. the circle of Tolkien's close friends) is not prone to take anything too seriously. These are happy days, and no less happy for being largely taken for granted. On leaving King Edward's in 1911, Tolkien wrote nostalgically in the school  Chronicle  : ' 'Twas a good road, a little rough, it may be, in places, but they say it is rougher further on...'  No one has forseen just how rough the coming years will be, or to what slaughter this generation is walking. Even now, at the close of 1913, despite growing signs that war impends for this 'over-civilized' world, the time and manner of its unfolding are unforseeable. Before four years have passed, the conflagration will have left four of Tolkien's fifteen-strong team wounded and four more dead- including T.K. Barnsley, G.B. Smith, and Rob Gilson.   Of every eight men mobilized in Britain during the First World War, one was killed. The losses from Tolkien's team were more than double that, but they bear comparison with the proportion of deaths among King Edward's Old Boys and among former public school boys across Great Britain-about one in five. And they match the figures for Oxbridge-educated servicemen of their age, the vast majority of whom became junior officers and had to lead operations and assaults. It has become unfashionable to give credit to Oxford and Cambridge, and to social elites in general; but it remains true that the Great War cut a deeper swathe through Tolkien's peers than among any other social group in Britain. Contemporaries spoke of the Lost Generation. 'By 1918', Tolkien wrote half a century later in his preface to the second edition of  The Lord of the Rings  ,'all but one of my close friends were dead.' "

       On May 29, 1846  Venerable John Henry Newman, who had been received into the Catholic Church in October of the previous year, wrote this letter to a friend: "Your letter has just come. Indeed I have thought a good deal of you and your troubles; and was about to write daily, but for a reason I will state presently. I have thought more of your wife, and still more of Mrs. Sargent, whose repeated trials I have talked over and mused upon with St. John. It is all very mysterious. So too is the distress of mind at this moment of other friends of mine, of a different kindI mean, their struggling to know whether or not they should join the Church of Rome, and not seeing their waya most consuming, exhausting trial. Yet it will, doubtless, all turn to good. Perhaps, if we knew all, we should know it is impossible for the elect of God to emerge from darkness to light in any other way. Such travail is necessary for the new birth. Perhaps if we saw our way too soon, there might be a re-action and old habits and associations might come over one again. I know too well of the state of those in doubt not to believe that the long trial of some is no sin of theirs, but God's way with them, imparting light slowly that He may impart it more effectually. My only dread is, and it is in some cases very great, when they are not, to all appearance, using the light given them, but shutting their eyes. And as doubt, long continued, may be the fiery process by which one person is brought into the Church, so the loss or alienation of friends by their conversion may be the divinely sent trial of others. It may be the gradual operation by which He prepares their own soul for the trial.  My paper will not let me say more. I am expecting daily a letter from Propaganda, which will determine whether I leave for Rome at the end of next month (June) or not. Keep this secret. I meant to write to you on receipt of it.  As to the reports about me  Decipi vult populus et decipiatur . If I put letters with my name into the papers, and the people will not believe, what is to be done? Ever yours affectionately, JOHN H. NEWMAN.  P.S.Don't tellbut I receive Minor Orders on the day before Trinity Sunday."

       Gerard Serafin reminds us all....  that it is   urlLink Chesterton's birthday.   urlLink Christopher  posts lots of links in honor of the day.   Here is a lengthy, but magnificent, quote, from the great G.K.C.: "To a Roman Catholic there is no particular difference between those parts of the religion which Protestants and others accept and those parts which they reject. The dogmas have, of course, their intrinsic theological proportions; but in his feeling they are all one thing. The Mass is as Christian as the Gospel. The Gospel is as Catholic as the Mass. This, I fancy, is the fact which the Protestant world has found it most difficult to understand and about which some of the most unfortunate forms of ill-feeling have appeared. Yet it arises quite naturally from the actual history of the Church, which has had to contend incessantly with quite other and quite opposite heresies. She has not only had to defeat these sects to defend these doctrines, but to defeat other sects to defend other doctrines including the doctrines which these sects rightly hold so dear. It was only the Roman Catholic Church that saved the Protestant truths. It may be right to rest on the Bible, but there would be no Bible if the Gnostics had proved that the Old Testament was written by the Devil, or had littered the world with Apocryphal Gospels. It may be right to say that Jesus alone saves from sin, but nobody would be saying it if a Pelagian movement had altered the whole notion of sin. Even the very selection of dogmas which the reformers decided to preserve had only been preserved for them by the authority which they denied.  It is natural, therefore, for Catholics not to be always thinking of the antithesis of Catholic and Protestant any more than of Catholic and Pelagian. Catholicism is used to proposals to cut down the creed to a few clauses; but different people have wanted quite different clauses left and quite different clauses cut out. Thus a Catholic does not feel the special reverence paid to the Mother of God as any more of a controversial question than the divine honours paid to the Son of God; for he knows the latter was as much controverted by the Arians as the former by the Puritans. He does not feel the throne of St. Peter to be any more specially in dispute than the theology of St. Paul, for he knows that both have been disputed. There have been anti-popes; there have been Apocryphal Gospels; there have been sects dethroning our Lady and sects dethroning our Lord. After nearly two thousand years of this sort of thing, Catholics have come to regard Catholicism as one thing, all the parts of which are in one sense equally assailed and in another sense equally unassailable.  Now it is unfortunately impossible for a Roman Catholic to state the principle without its sounding provocative and, what is much worse, superior; but unless he does state it, he does not state Roman Catholicism. Having stated it, however, in its dogmatic and defiant form, as it is his duty to do, he may afterwards suggest something of why the system seems, to those inside it, to be not so much a system as a home, and even a holiday. Thus it certainly does not mean being superior in the sense of supercilious; for in this system alone, only the saint is superior because he feels he is inferior. It does not say that all heretics are lost, for it does say that there is a common conscience by which they may be saved. But it does definitely say that he who knows the whole truth sins in accepting half the truth. Thus the Church is not a movement, like all those which have filled the world since the sixteenth century; that is, since the breakdown of the collective attempt of all Christendom to state the whole truth. It is not the movement of something trying to find its balance; it is the balance. But the point here is that even those heretics, who snatched at half-truths, seldom snatched at the same half. The original Protestants insisted on Hell without Purgatory. Their modern successors generally insist on Purgatory without Hell. Their future successors may quite possibly insist on Purgatory without Heaven. It may seem a natural sequence to the worship of Progress for its own sake, and the theory that 'to travel hopefully is better than to arrive.' For the Catholic each of these things may be disputed in its turn, and all will remain."

       Mary is the "Virgo Potens," the Powerful Virgin  by Venerable John Henry Newman,C.O.   "This great universe, which we see by day and by night, or what is called the natural world, is ruled by fixed laws, which the Creator has imposed upon it, and by those wonderful laws is made secure against any substantial injury or loss. One portion of it may conflict with another, and there may be changes in it internally; but, viewed as a whole, it is adapted to stand for ever. Hence the Psalmist says, 'He has established the world, which shall not be moved.'  Such is the world of nature; but there is another and still more wonderful world. There is a power which avails to alter and subdue this visible world, and to suspend and counteract its laws; that is, the world of Angels and Saints, of Holy Church and her children; and the weapon by which they master its laws is the power of prayer.  By prayer all this may be done, which naturally is impossible. Noe prayed, and God said that there never again should be a flood to drown the race of man. Moses prayed, and ten grievous plagues fell upon the land of Egypt. Josue prayed, and the sun stood still. Samuel prayed, and thunder and rain came in wheat-harvest. Elias prayed, and brought down fire from heaven. Eliseus prayed, and the dead came to life. Ezechias prayed and the vast army of the Assyrians was smitten and perished.  This is why the Blessed Virgin is called  Powerful  -nay, sometimes,  All -powerful, because she has, more than anyone else, more than all Angels and Saints, this great, prevailing gift of prayer. No one has access to the Almighty as His Mother has; none has merit such as hers. Her Son will deny her nothing that she asks; and herein lies her power. While she defends the Church, neither height nor depth, neither men nor evil spirits, neither great monarchs, nor craft of man, nor popular violence, can avail to harm us; for human life is short, but Mary reigns above, a Queen for ever."   Meditations and Devotions

       Two little notes...  First off, I must confess that the biography of St. Philip I wrote has one error. You see, I read a biography which said that he was born on the Vigil of the Feast of St. Mary Magalene, so I assumed that meant that he was born on July 21. He was actually born on July 22- but at 2 am, so it was before sunrise and thus still the Vigil.   Secondly, I must confess that  urlLink Lane Core  is a bit too kind when he refers to my 'refurbished' blog. I'm afraid I'm too lazy to refurbish on my own. What actually happened is that my template got eaten by a bug and I had to start over.....

       TODAY !  IT'S ST. PHILIP'S DAY ! GAUDETE SEMPER EVERYBODY !   First off, here is a  urlLink short biography.   urlLink You    urlLink might   urlLink want   urlLink to   urlLink check    urlLink out   urlLink the    urlLink twelve-part   urlLink biography   urlLink  that    urlLink  I   urlLink wrote.   Here is a  urlLink photograph of his body, which rests under one of the altars in Santa Maria in Vallicella (after his death a silver mask and silver mesh gloves were placed upon it) ,  and  urlLink photos   urlLink of   urlLink some paintings .   Here's a  urlLink a lot of images of St. Philip . I'm rather fond of  urlLink these    urlLink two , which show him celebrating Mass.  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. preached this  urlLink two-  urlLink part  sermon on the life of St. Philip, and composed a  urlLink Litany of St. Philip Neri . Yours truly composed an  urlLink Oratorian Litany .   There is this  urlLink lovely passage  from  The Idea of a University .   Finally, a prayer, written by Venerable Newman, to invoke St. Philip's intercession: "O my dear and holy Patron, Philip, I put myself into thy hands, and for the love of Jesus, for that loves sake which chose and made thee a saint, I implore thee to pray for me, that, as He has brought thee to heaven, so in due time He may take me to heaven also.  And I beg of thee to gain for me a true devotion to the Holy Ghost, by means of that grace which He Himself, the Third Person of the glorious Trinity, bestows. Gain for me a portion of that overflowing devotion which thou hadst towards Him when thou wast on earth; for that, O my dear father, was one of thy special distinctions from other saints, that, though they all adored supremely and solely the Holy Ghost as their one God, yet thou, like Pope St. Gregory, the Apostle of England, didst adore Him not only in the unity of the Godhead, but also as proceeding from the Father and the Son, the gift of the Most High and the Giver of life.  Gain for me, O holy Philip, such a measure of thy devotion towards Him, that, as He did deign to come into thy heart miraculously and set it on fire with love, He may reward us too with some special and corresponding gift of grace. O Philip, let us not be the cold sons of so fervent a Father. It will be a great reproach to thee, if thou dost not make us in some measure like thyself. Gain for us the grace of prayer and meditation, power to command our thoughts and keep from distractions, and the gift of conversing with God without being wearied.  Heart of fire, Light of holy joy, Victim of love, pray for me."   A thank you to all those who have mentioned the feast on their blogs, including  urlLink Gerard Serafin , urlLink John da Fiesole ,  urlLink Kevin MIller , and  urlLink Lane Core . The last-named is also celebrating his  urlLink Blogoversary  today.  Update: Add  urlLink Fr. Tharp  to the list of St. Philip bloggers !

       Tommorow....  is St. Philip's Day !    Philip's Miraculous Gifts  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Philip's great and solid virtues were crowned and adorned by the divine Majesty with various and extraordinary favours, which he in vain used every artifice, if possible, to hide.  It was the good-pleasure of God to enable him to penetrate His ineffable mysteries and to know His marvellous providences by means of ecstasies, raptures, and visions, which were of frequent occurrence during the whole of his life.  A friend going one morning to confession to him, on opening the door of his room softly, saw the Saint in the act of prayer, raised upon his feet, his eyes looking to heaven, his hands extended. He stood for a while watching him, and then going close to him spoke to himbut the saint did not perceive him at all. This state of abstraction continued about eight minutes longer; then he came to himself.  He had the consolation of seeing in vision the souls of many, especially of his friends and penitents, go to heaven. Indeed, those who were intimate with him held it for certain, that none of his spiritual children died without his being certified of the state of their souls.  Philip, both by his sanctity and experience, was able to discriminate between true and false visions. He was earnest in warning men against being deluded, which is very easy and probable.  Philip was especially eminent, even among saints, for his gifts of foretelling the future and reading the heart. The examples of these gifts which might be produced would fill volumes. He foretold the deaths of some; he foretold the recovery of others; he foretold the future course of others; he foretold the births of children to those who were childless; he foretold who would be the Popes before their election; he had the gift of seeing things at a distance; and he knew what was going on in the minds of his penitents and others around him.  He knew whether his penitents had said their prayers, and for how long they were praying. Many of them when talking together, if led into any conversation which was dangerous or wrong, would say: 'We must stop, for St. Philip will find it out.'  Once a woman came to him to confession, when in reality she wished to get an alms. He said to her: 'In God's name, good woman, go away; there is no bread for you'-and nothing could induce him to hear her confession.  A man who went to confess to him did not speak, but began to tremble, and when asked, said, 'I am ashamed,' for he had committed a most grievous sin. Philip said gently: 'Do not be afraid; I will tell you what it was'-and, to the penitent's great astonishment, he told him.   Such instances are innumerable. There was not one person intimate with Philip who did not affirm that he knew the secrets of the heart most marvellously.  He was almost equally marvellous in his power of healing and restoring to health. He relieved pain by the touch of his hand and the sign of the Cross. And in the same way he cured diseases instantaneouslyat other times by his prayersat other times he commanded the diseases to depart.  This gift was so well known that sick persons got possession of his clothes, his shoes, the cuttings of his hair, and God wrought cures by means of them.   Prayer  Philip, my holy Patron, the wounds and diseases of my soul are greater than bodily ones, and are beyond thy curing, even with thy supernatural power. I know that my Almighty Lord reserves in His own hands the recovery of the soul from death, and the healing of all its maladies. But thou canst do more for our souls by thy prayers now, my dear Saint, than thou didst for the bodies of those who applied to thee when thou wast upon earth. Pray for me, that the Divine Physician of the soul, Who alone reads my heart thoroughly, may cleanse it thoroughly, and that I and all who are dear to me may be cleansed from all our sins; and, since we must die, one and all, that we may die, as thou didst, in the grace and love of God, and with the assurance, like thee, of eternal life."

       Only two days...  until St. Philip's Day !   Philip's Care for the Salvation of Souls  by Venerable John Henry Newman,C.O.  "When he was a young priest, and had gathered about him a number of spiritual persons, his first wish was to go with them all to preach the gospel to the heathen of India, where St. Francis Xavier was engaged in his wonderful careerand he only gave up the idea in obedience to the holy men whom he consulted.  As to bad Christians at home, such extreme desire had he for their conversion, that even when he was old he took severe disciplines in their behalf, and wept for their sins as if they had been his own.  While a layman, he converted by one sermon thirty dissolute youths.  He was successful, under the grace of God, in bringing back almost an infinite number of sinners to the paths of holiness. Many at the hour of death cried out, 'Blessed be the day when first I came to know Father Philip!' Others, 'Father Philip draws souls to him as the magnet draws iron.'  With a view to the fulfilment of what he considered his special mission, he gave himself up entirely to hearing confessions, exclusive of every other employment. Before sunrise he had generally confessed a good number of penitents in his own room. He went down into the church at daybreak, and never left it till noon, except to say Mass. If no penitents came, he remained near his confessional, reading, saying office, or telling his beads. If he was at prayer, if at his meals, he at once broke off when his penitents came.  He never intermitted his hearing of confessions for any illness, unless the physician forbade it.  For the same reason he kept his room-door open, so that he was exposed to the view of everyone who passed it.  He had a particular anxiety about boys and young men. He was most anxious to have them always occupied, for he knew that idleness was the parent of every evil. Sometimes he made work for them, when he could not find any.  He let them make what noise they pleased about him, if in so doing he was keeping them from temptation. When a friend remonstrated with him for letting them so interfere with him, he made answer: 'So long as they do not sin, they may chop wood upon my back.'  He was allowed by the Dominican Fathers to take out their novices for recreation. He used to delight to see them at their holiday meal. He used to say, 'Eat, my sons, and do not scruple about it, for it makes me fat to watch you;' and then, when dinner was over, he made them sit in a ring around him,and told them the secrets of their hearts, and gave them good advice, and exhorted them to virtue.  He had a remarkable power of consoling the sick, and of delivering them from the temptations with which the devil assails them.  To his zeal for the conversion of souls, Philip always joined the exercise of corporal acts of mercy. He visited the sick in the hospitals, served them in all their necessities, made their beds, swept the floor round them, and gave them their meals.   Prayer  Philip, my holy Patron, who wast so careful for the souls of thy brethren, and especially of thy own people, when on earth, slack not thy care of them now, when thou art in heaven. Be with us, who are thy children and thy clients; and, with thy greater power with God, and with thy more intimate insight into our needs and our dangers, guide us along the path which leads to God and to thee. Be to us a good father; make our priests blameless and beyond reproach or scandal; make our children obedient, our youth prudent and chaste, our heads of families wise and gentle, our old people cheerful and fervent, and build us up, by thy powerful intercessions, in faith, hope, charity, and all virtues."

       Almost there !  Three days until St. Philip's Day !    Philip's Patience  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "Philip was for years and years the butt and laughing-stock of all the hangers-on of the great palaces of the nobility at Rome, who said all the bad of him that came into their heads, because they did not like to see a virtuous and conscientious man.  This sarcastic talk against him lasted for years and years; so that Rome was full of it, and through all the shops and counting-houses the idlers and evil livers did nothing but ridicule Philip.  When they fixed some calumny upon him, he did not take it in the least amiss, but with the greatest calmness contented himself with a simple smile.  Once a gentleman's servant began to abuse him so insolently that a person of consideration, who witnessed the insult, was about to lay hands on him; but, when he saw with what gentleness and cheerfulness Philip took it, he restrained himself, and ever after counted Philip as a saint.  Sometimes his own spiritual children, and even those who lay under the greatest obligations to him, treated him as if he were a rude and foolish person; but he did not show any resentment.  Once, when he was Superior of the Congregation, one of his subjects snatched a letter out of his hand; but the saint took the affront with incomparable meekness, and neither in look, nor word, nor in gesture betrayed the slightest emotion.  Patience had so completely become a habit with him, that he was never seen in a passion. He checked the first movement of resentful feeling; his countenance calmed instantly, and he reassumed his usual modest smile.   Prayer  Philip, my holy Advocate, who didst bear persecution and calumny, pain and sickness, with so admirable a patience, gain for me the grace of true fortitude under all the trials of this life. Alas! how do I need patience! I shrink from every small inconvenience; I sicken under every light affliction; I fire up at every trifling contradiction; I fret and am cross at every little suffering of body. Gain for me the grace to enter with hearty good-will into all such crosses as I may receive day by day from my Heavenly Father. Let me imitate thee, as thou didst imitate my Lord and Saviour, that so, as thou hast attained heaven by thy calm endurance of bodily and mental pain, I too may attain the merit of patience, and the reward of life everlasting."

       On June 5, 1847  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., celebrated his First Mass. "To me nothing is so consoling, so piercing, so thrilling, so overcoming, as the Mass, said as it is among us. I could attend Masses for ever, and not be tired. It is not a mere form of wordsit is a great action, the greatest action that can be on earth. It is, not the invocation merely, but, if I dare use the word, the evocation of the Eternal. He becomes present on the altar in flesh and blood, before whom angels bow and devils tremble. This is that awful event which is the scope, and the interpretation, of every part of the solemnity. Words are necessary, but as means, not as ends; they are not mere addresses to the throne of grace, they are instruments of what is far higher, of consecration, of sacrifice." -  Loss and Gain

       For Friday  "One drop of His blood had been sufficient to satisfy for our sins; He might have offered His circumcision as an atonement, and it would have been sufficient; one moment of His agony of blood had been sufficient, one stroke of the scourge might have wrought a sufficient satisfaction. But neither circumcision, agony, nor scourging was our redemption, because He did not offer them as such. The price He paid was nothing short of the whole treasure of His blood, poured forth to the last drop from His veins and sacred heart. He shed His whole life for us; He left Himself empty of His all. He left His throne on high; He gave up His home on earth; He parted with His Mother, He gave His strength and His toil, He gave His body and soul, He offered up His passion, His crucifixion, and His death that man should not be bought for nothing. This is what the apostle intimates in saying that we are 'bought with a  great  price'; and the prophet, while he declares that 'with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him a  copious ' or 'plenteous redemption'. " -Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  Discourses to Mixed Congregations

       On June 3, 1844  Venerable John Henry Newman, who had given up his Anglican ministry the previous year but was still struggling with whether or not he should come into the Catholic Church, wrote this letter to his sister: "'Calmet's Dictionary' was a book the boys had (i.e. brought from home) at school, and was popular. It is, in fact, a very popular book, as well as a good book, and I am surprised aunt and you should not know it. I have never seen it myself since I was a boy. I wish I had, but it is too dear to buy. For a long while I used to think Calmet was a Protestant; but he was a good monk of the Benedictine Order, a strict man and a reformer in his day. I know two other of his workshis Comment on the Rule of St. Benedict, and his Literal Commentary on Scripture, which I think Adam Clarke (!) pronounced the best commentary on Scripture extant; it is very good certainly.    You must not be surprised if I should determine on giving up my Fellowship: but at present I have no plan formed.  I was glad to see J. Fourdrinier and Mr. Deane. You must not suppose I put on a cheerfulness because people do not find out I have cares; the truth is (thank God!) I am cheerful. And though it so entirely depends on Him that I might be cast down for good and all any day, and know not, of course, what is before me, yet having sound sleep at night, and quiet days, and trying to serve Him without aims of this world, however imperfectly, how can I but be cheerful, as I am? And I trust He will overrule all painful things which myself or others have to bear, to our good. Of course the pain of my friends is what cuts me, and I do not know how I shall bear it; but He gives us strength according to our day. "

Oh, well, I guess I'll post a notice that the  urlLink final part of  Apologia Pro Vita Sua   was published as a pamphlet on this date in 1864. Oh, and this bit of verse....  Day-Labourers   by Venerable John Henry Newman,C.O.    "And He said, It is finished."   "One only, of God's messengers to man,  Finish'd the work of grace, which He began;  E'en Moses wearied upon Nebo's height,         Though loth to leave the fight  With the doom'd foe, and yield the sun-bright land         To Joshua's armèd hand.   And David wrought in turn a strenuous part,  Zeal for God's house consuming him in heart;  And yet he might not build, but only bring         Gifts for the Heavenly King;  And these another rear'd, his peaceful son,         Till the full work was done.   List, Christian warrior! thou, whose soul is fain  To rid thy Mother of her present chain;  Christ will avenge His Bride; yea, even now         Begins the work, and thou  Shalt spend in it thy strength, but, ere He save,         Thy lot shall be the grave.

       Relics of Saints   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. " He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto Him.  "   " 'The Fathers are in dust, yet live to God:' "      So says the Truth; as if the motionless clay  Still held the seeds of life beneath the sod,      Smouldering and struggling till the judgment-day.   And hence we learn with reverence to esteem      Of these frail houses, though the grave confines;  Sophist may urge his cunning tests, and deem      That they are earth;-but they are heavenly shrines."

       For Saturday  "The title  Theotocos , or Mother of God, was familiar to Christians from primitive times, and had been used, among other writers, by Origen, Eusebius, St. Alexander, St. Athanasius, St. Ambrose, St. Gregory Nazianzen, St. Gregory Nyssen, and St. Nilus. She had been called Ever-Virgin by others, as by St. Epiphanius, St. Jerome, and Didymus. By others, 'the Mother of all living,' as being the antitype of Eve; for, as St. Epiphanius observes, 'in truth,' not in shadow, 'from Mary was Life itself brought into the world, that Mary might bear things living, and might become Mother of living things.'St. Augustine says that all have sinned 'except the Holy Virgin Mary, concerning whom, for the honour of the Lord, I wish no question to be raised at all, when we are treating of sins.' 'She was alone and wrought the world's salvation,' says St. Ambrose, alluding to her conception of the Redeemer. She is signified by the Pillar of the cloud which guided the Israelites, according to the same Father; and she had 'so great grace, as not only to have virginity herself, but to impart it to those to whom she came;''the Rod out of the stem of Jesse,' says St. Jerome, and 'the Eastern gate through which the High Priest alone goes in and out, yet is ever shut;'the wise woman, says St. Nilus, who 'hath clad all believers, from the fleece of the Lamb born of her, with the clothing of incorruption, and delivered them from their spiritual nakedness;''the Mother of Life, of beauty, of majesty, the Morning Star,' according to Antiochus;'the mystical new heavens,' 'the heavens carrying the Divinity,' 'the fruitful vine by whom we are translated from death unto life,' according to St. Ephraim;'the manna which is delicate, bright, sweet, and virgin, which, as though coming from heaven, has poured down on all the people of the Churches a food pleasanter than honey,' according to St. Maximus.  St. Proclus calls her 'the unsullied shell which contains the pearl of price,' 'the sacred shrine of sinlessness,' 'the golden altar of holocaust,' 'the holy oil of anointing,' 'the costly alabaster box of spikenard,' 'the ark gilt within and without,' 'the heifer whose ashes, that is, the Lord's Body taken from her, cleanses those who are defiled by the pollution of sin,' 'the fair bride of the Canticles,' 'the stay ([ sterigma ]) of believers,' 'the Church's diadem,' 'the expression of orthodoxy.' These are oratorical expressions; but we use oratory on great subjects, not on small. Elsewhere he calls her 'God's only bridge to man;' and elsewhere he breaks forth, 'Run through all creation in your thoughts, and see if there be equal to, or greater than, the Holy Virgin Mother of God.' " - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,   An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine

       From  Faith and Prejudice and Other Unpublished Sermons    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. (ed. He is discussing the Parable of the Unjust Steward.)  "Charges were brought against the Steward, and his employer called on him to answer them, or rather examined them, and found them well-founded. And so it is sometimes with us, that our conscience, which is the voice of God in the soul, upbraids us, brings before us our neglect of duty, the careless, the irreligious, the evil life which we are leading, our disregard of God's commands, glory, and worship; and anticipates that judgement which is to come. Now sometimes this self-accusation leads us to true repentance and change of lifecertainly, praise be to God, this is sometimes the case; but more frequently, instead of turning us into the right path, it has the effect of making us go more wrong than we were before. When the Steward found he could not make good what his Lord had a right to demand of him, he had three courses before him besides that which he adopted; he might have made his debts good by extra work; again he might have got friends to have supplied the deficiency; or, he might have thrown himself on his Lord's mercy. He might have digged, or he might have begged; but he rejected both means. 'I cannot dig,' he said, 'to beg I am ashamed.' So he went off into a further act of dishonesty to the disadvantage of his master. And in like manner, we, when we have been unfaithful to our good God and feel compunction for that unfaithfulness, have two modes of recovery: we might dig, that is, we might do works of penance; we might vigorously change our life; we might fight with our bad habits; we might redeem the time; that is, we might dig. But we cannot make up our minds to this laborious course; it is too great a sacrifice; it is above us; we cannot dig. And secondly we might beg; that is, we might pray God to forgive us and to change us; we might go to confess our sin and beg for absolution; we might beg the prayers of others, the prayers of the Saints; but to many men, especially to those who are not Catholics, this is more difficult even than labour: 'to beg we are ashamed.' Begging seems something inconsistent with what they call the dignity of human nature; they think it unmanly, cowardly, slavish; it wounds their pride to confess themselves miserable sinners, to come to a priest, to say the Rosary, to give themselves to certain devotions, day after day; they think such a course as much beneath them as a valiant effort to overcome themselves is above them. They cannot dig, to beg they are ashamed; and therefore they attempt to destroy the sense of their sins, which has fallen upon them by some means worse than those sins themselvesI mean, such as denying perhaps that there is any such thing as sin, saying that it is a bugbear invented by priests, nay perhaps going so far as to say that there is no judgement to come, no God above who will see and will judge what they say or do.  Such is the repentance of men of the world, when conscience reproaches them. It is not a true turning from sin, but a turning to worse sinthey go on to  deny  the Holy Commandment because they have transgressed it; they explain away the sinfulness of sin because they have sinned. St. Paul speaks of this evil repentance, if it may be called by that name, in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, when he says to them the words of 2 Cor. vii. 10. Such is the state of mankind as we see it realized on a large scale on the face of human society in the world at large. When they do evil, act against their conscience and clear duty, there is this opposition between what they know and what they do; light becomes darkness, and instead of the light within them destroying their tendencies to sin, their sins dim or stifle that light, and they become worse than they were, because they were bad already."

       On June 9, 1872  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  The Fall of Man   "1. INTROD.The ninety-nine are the angels, the one is man.  2. Man is one because perhaps there are indefinitely more angels than men; and next, because Adam was one head, the head of our race. We all sinned in Adam, but each angel who fell sinned in himself.  3. The account of Adam's fall.  4. Now, to understand how great it was, we must consider Adam's high gifts. It was a miracle almost, a violation of his nature and state, that he fell, for he had so many gifts.  5. Had he been like us we could understand it; but he was not like us. But on his falling he  lost  those gifts, and became what men are now, and that we can understand.   6. He came under God's angerhe was prone to sin; he was under captivity of the devil. The whole face of the world external was changed, as winter instead of summerthat  world , I may say, deprived of angels, of God's countenance, and full of the devil; even innocent things became infected and means of temptation.  7. He lost those gifts, and therefore, when he had offspring, he transmitted to them that nature which he had; but he could not transmit those gifts which he had forfeited.  8. Such, then, is our state as children of Adam. We are what he was after sinningin precisely the same stateand that state is called 'original sin.'  We have not  the advantage which Adam had.  9. Now, if a man says this is mysterious, hardly consistent with justice, I answer: (1) The whole of revelation must be mysterious, we do not know enough to defend it, because it is part of a whole system.  10. (2) God is not bound to give us high gifts such as He gave Adam. It is sufficient that He gives us such grace that it is our fault if we do not go right.  11. (3) But, again, Christ came to set all right."

       From the homily...  Fr. Michael was the celebrant at the 12:10 Mass today. What I remember best was his remark that there is a bit of wordplay in the original Hebrew of the first reading, in which the 'man of God' ( ish Elohim ) calls down the 'fire of God'( esh Elohim ) Now, we are filled with the Fire of God at our baptism, and thus are called to be men of God throughout out lives. (I am using the term 'men' in its inclusive sense, of course....)

       June 8, 1851  was Pentecost, and Venerable John Henry Newman,C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  The Life-Giving Spirit   "1. INTROD.We have what we have waited for. Paschal time is not only a time of rejoicing, but of waiting for a gift. The  whole creation groaning , etc. Hence, now being the end, we go no further, but date our time from Pentecost.  2. The gift of today set up the Church, hence it is said to be a vehement wind filling the house. Solomon's temple filled with the glory, as the sweet nard filled the house.  3. For up to this date the Church was not formed. The multitude who followed Christ was but matter. They were not a body filled with Christ. Christ was with them, but external; they were not confirmed. They were all scattered abroad as sheep. Hence as an individual may have first actual, then habitual graceso the  multitudo fidelium  all Paschal time is begging to be the bride of Christ.  4. Now then the Spirit came down, to gather together the children of God, etc., all those who had fled away, etc.; returned3000-5000 .  5. Like the resurrection of dry bones, Ezech. xxxvii.  6. Such is the power, the manifestation, of the Spirit; thus sudden, thus gentle, thus silent. It is life from deathwhat health is after sickness. It makes young. Oh what a gift is this! Who would not wonder if a physician could make an old man young? See him, unable to do more than grope about, his limbs stiff, his face withered, etc., etc. But the physician comes, and health and comeliness and vigour return, etc. This is what is fulfilled by the power of the Spirit, in a measure in individuals, certainly in the body.  7. And is it possible such is in store for England?(explain). Nothing unexpected, nothing too difficult. It is grace, yet spreading not at once.  8. Prayer for it. Never so much prayer as now."

       From  The Idea of a University   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "Knowledge is one thing, virtue is another; good sense is not conscience, refinement is not humility, nor is largeness and justness of view faith. Philosophy, however enlightened, however profound, gives no command over the passions, no influential motives, no vivifying principles. Liberal Education makes not the Christian, not the Catholic, but the gentleman. It is well to be a gentleman, it is well to have a cultivated intellect, a delicate taste, a candid, equitable, dispassionate mind, a noble and courteous bearing in the conduct of life;these are the connatural qualities of a large knowledge; they are the objects of a University; I am advocating, I shall illustrate and insist upon them; but still, I repeat, they are no guarantee for sanctity or even for conscientiousness, they may attach to the man of the world, to the profligate, to the heartless,pleasant, alas, and attractive as he shows when decked out in them. Taken by themselves, they do but seem to be what they are not; they look like virtue at a distance, but they are detected by close observers, and on the long run; and hence it is that they are popularly accused of pretence and hypocrisy, not, I repeat, from their own fault, but because their professors and their admirers persist in taking them for what they are not, and are officious in arrogating for them a praise to which they have no claim. Quarry the granite rock with razors, or moor the vessel with a thread of silk; then may you hope with such keen and delicate instruments as human knowledge and human reason to contend against those giants, the passion and the pride of man."

       From  An Essay in aid of a Grammar of Assent   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. "Break a ray of light into its constituent colours, each is beautiful, each may be enjoyed; attempt to unite them, and perhaps you produce only a dirty white. The pure and indivisible Light is seen only by the blessed inhabitants of heaven; here we have but such faint reflections of it as its diffraction supplies; but they are sufficient for faith and devotion. Attempt to combine them into one, and you gain nothing but a mystery, which you can describe as a notion, but cannot depict as an imagination. And this, which holds of the Divine Attributes, holds also of the Holy Trinity in Unity. And hence, perhaps, it is that the latter doctrine is never spoken of as a Mystery in the sacred book, which is addressed far more to the imagination and affections than to the intellect. Hence, too, what is more remarkable, in the Creeds the dogma is not called a mystery; not in the Apostles' nor the Nicene, nor even in the Athanasian. The reason seems to be, that the Creeds have a place in the Ritual; they are devotional acts, and of the nature of prayers, addressed to God; and, in such addresses, to speak of intellectual difficulties would be out of place. It must be recollected especially that the Athanasian Creed has sometimes been called the 'Psalmus  Quicunque .' It is not a mere collection of notions, however momentous. It is a psalm or hymn of praise, of confession, and of profound, self-prostrating homage, parallel to the canticles of the elect in the Apocalypse. It appeals to the imagination quite as much as to the intellect. It is the war-song of faith, with which we warn, first ourselves, then each other, and then all those who are within its hearing, and the hearing of the Truth, who our God is, and how we must worship Him, and how vast our responsibility will be, if we know what to believe, and yet believe not."

       Music at the 11:30 am Mass  Processional Hymn: "Holy, Holy Holy" Offertory: "O God Beyond All Praising"- Gustav Holst ( 1874-1934) Communion: "Here, O My Lord"- Warren Swenson (1934- )  Postcommunion Hymn: "Firmly I Believe and Truly" Recessional Hymn: "Holy God, We Praise Thy Name"  After today, our choir is going on break until the fall. Our director found a beautiful prayer which we have been praying together before each Mass, and it might be useful for any other choir folks out there.  "Open my mouth, O Lord, in praise of Thy Holy Name. Cleanse my heart of all worldly thoughts. Prepare my intellect and inflame my will that I may worthily sing this Divine Service. As we gather to sing Thy praise, may we but touch one soul and lead it to Thee. May our music foreshadow Thy beauty, which we shall see forever in Thy Kingdom. Through Christ our Lord.

       Zeal and Patience   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  " I, Paul, the prisoner of the Lord. "   "O Comrade bold of toil and pain!      Thy trial how severe,  When sever'd first by prisoner's chain      From thy loved labour-sphere!   Say, did impatience first impel       The heaven-sent bond to break?  Or, couldst thou bear its hindrance well,      Loitering for Jesu's sake?   Oh, might we know! for sore we feel      The languor of delay,  When sickness lets our fainter zeal,       Or foes block up our way.     Lord! who Thy thousand years dost wait       To work the thousandth part   Of Thy vast plan, for us create       With zeal a patient heart."    Off Sardinia. June 19, 1833.

       The Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus  is today. There is information on it  urlLink here.  "May Thy Heart dwell always in our hearts! May Thy Blood ever flow in the veins of our souls! O Sun of our hearts, Thou givest life to all things by the rays of Thy goodness! I will not go until Thy Heart has strengthened me, O Lord Jesus! May the Heart of Jesus be the King of my heart! Blessed be God. Amen." - St. Francis deSales, Bishop and Doctor of the Church  "Relatively modern under the form that it actually bears, the devotion to the Sacred Heart has its dogmatic roots in the deposit of faith. It was contained in germ in the words of St. John: 'The Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us ... having loved His own ... He loved them unto the end' (Jn 1:14; 13:1). What, in fact, is the Incarnation? It is the manifestation of God, it is God revealing Himself to us through the Humanity of Jesus:  Nova mentis nostrae oculis lux tuae claritatis infulsit  (Preface of the Nativity); it is the manifestation of Divine love to the world: 'God so loved the world, as to give His Only-begotten Son'; and this Son Himself so loved men as to deliver Himself up for them: 'Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends':  Majorem hac dilectionem nemo habet  (Jn 15:13). All the devotion to the Sacred Heart is in germ in these words of Jesus. And in order to show that His love had attained the supreme degree, Christ Jesus willed that immediately after He had drawn His last breath on the Cross, His Heart should be pierced by the soldier's lance." - Blessed Columba Marmion, O.S.B.   "O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I adore Thee in the oneness of the Personality of the Second Person of the Holy Trinity. Whatever belongs to the Person of Jesus, belongs therefore to God, and is to be worshipped with that one and the same worship which we pay to Jesus. He did not take on Him His human nature, as something distinct and separate from Himself, but as simply, absolutely, eternally His, so as to be included by us in the very thought of Him. I worship Thee, O Heart of Jesus, as being Jesus Himself, as being that Eternal Word in human nature which He took wholly and lives in wholly, and therefore in Thee. Thou art the Heart of the Most High made man. In worshipping Thee, I worship my Incarnate God, Emmanuel. I worship Thee, as bearing a part in that Passion which is my life, for Thou didst burst and break, through agony, in the garden of Gethsemani, and Thy precious contents trickled out, through the veins and pores of the skin, upon the earth. And again, Thou hadst been drained all but dry upon the Cross; and then, after death, Thou wast pierced by the lance, and gavest out the small remains of that inestimable treasure, which is our redemption.  2. My God, my Saviour, I adore Thy Sacred Heart, for that heart is the seat and source of all Thy tenderest human affections for us sinners. It is the instrument and organ of Thy love. It did beat for us. It yearned over us. It ached for us, and for our salvation. It was on fire through zeal, that the glory of God might be manifested in and by us. It is the channel through which has come to us all Thy overflowing human affection, all Thy Divine Charity towards us. All Thy incomprehensible compassion for us, as God and Man, as our Creator and our Redeemer and Judge, has come to us, and comes, in one inseparably mingled stream, through that Sacred Heart. O most Sacred symbol and Sacrament of Love, divine and human, in its fulness, Thou didst save me by Thy divine strength, and Thy human affection, and then at length by that wonder-working blood, wherewith Thou didst overflow.  3. O most Sacred, most loving Heart of Jesus, Thou art concealed in the Holy Eucharist, and Thou beatest for us still. Now as then Thou savest,  Desiderio desideravi -'With desire I have desired.' I worship Thee then with all my best love and awe, with my fervent affection, with my most subdued, most resolved will. O my God, when Thou dost condescend to suffer me to receive Thee, to eat and drink Thee, and Thou for a while takest up Thy abode within me, O make my heart beat with Thy Heart. Purify it of all that is earthly, all that is proud and sensual, all that is hard and cruel, of all perversity, of all disorder, of all deadness. So fill it with Thee, that neither the events of the day nor the circumstances of the time may have power to ruffle it, but that in Thy love and Thy fear it may have peace."- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  There was also a sermon of the Venerable, of which the following notes survive:  The Sacred Heart  "1. INTROD.Many devotions in Holy Church. This is one which has spread of late years, more, I may say, than any other. Today is the special feast of it; and [this] leads me to explain in what it consists.  2. Our Lord is One. He is the one God. He took on Him a manhood, a body and soul; that body from Mary. Still, He was one, not twoone, as each of us is one.  3. We too, in our way, are each of us one, though we are twosoul and bodyand the body has parts; [nevertheless] each of us is  one . This is what is meant by speaking of our Lord's [oneness] as we speak of our own.  4. And though each of us is thus composite, we can love each other as one, though of so many parts. And in like manner, though our Lord is God and man, with a soul [and body], we can contemplate Him as one, and worship, love Him as one.  5. Further, if I said I loved the face, or the smile, or liked to take the hand of my father or mother, it would be because I loved them. And so, when I speak of the separate portions of our Lord's human frame, I really am worshipping Him. So in the Blessed Sacrament we do not conceive of His Body and Blood as separate from Him.  6. Devotions at various times [and ages]the Wounds, the Blood, the Faceand in like manner the Heart. We worship [each] as Him, as that One Person who is God and man; we worship [ Him ] by the memento, the pledge of His Heart.  7. Why? The Heart a  symbol so the Wounds and the Blood. [In contrast with these] a symbol is sometimes that which [only] expresses and remindsthus water, oil, wine, bread.  8. What is the Heart the symbol of?of His love, His affection for us, so that He suffered for usthe agony in the garden.  9. Moreover, of His love in the Holy Eucharist.  10. The Heart was the seat, first, of His love for us; secondly, of His many griefs and sorrows.  [The following were appended, apparently as alternatives:]   7. Of two things especially to remind us now, when the world is so strongHis power and His love. He will overcome by love.  8. The Heart is the emblem of His lovein worshipping It we worship Him."

       Some wise words...  "As Christ hides Himself from us in the Holy Eucharist, so does He hide from us ourselves, in mercy. We are weak,we are not able to bear great burdens yet; light burdens are heavy to us. Moreover, if penitents are bent on lading themselves heavily, let them know that the greatest of burdens, as well as the most appropriate, is what is lasting, what is continual. A slight penance, if long, is far more trying than a severe one, if short. This stands to reason; for it outlasts their present agitated state of mind. For the same reason, it is more beneficial, for it reminds them of what they afterwards will be likely to forget. A stone in time is hollowed by a continual dropping; and be sure that a very easy rule, if it endures, is a very severe trial. It is not much of a penance to take upon one what is a mere relief to the feelings, and to end it when the feelings cease to require it. True penitence is that which never comes to an end; and true penance is that which lasts as long as penitence.

       On June 16, 1872  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:   The World, the Flesh, and the Devil   "1. INTROD.The whole creation travaileth.  2. All creatures must be imperfect and tend to corruption if left to themselves. All creation  which we see the visible world.  3. The visible world requires a support to its laws; they cannot support themselves.  4. And still clearer as regards separate beings. All things  in fluxu et transitu.  5. Brute animal passionbut without sinbut no brute passion but exists in man.  6. Such excesses the gift of reason is to hinder and subdue; and therefore sin in not doing so.  7. But the conflict so strong that it requires the grace of God.  8. Now we see the state to which original sin, the sin of Adam, has reduced us. It has rendered us like the brutes, because it has deprived us of grace, yet left us in sin.  9. This stripped human nature is called in Scripture the  flesh  (Cain's fratricide, the flood, destruction of Sodom, state of things when our Lord came)  10. And is our second giant enemy. Our first enemy is the devil.  11. Now trace the effects of the fleshthe growth of evil in individuals, in bodies; the power of exampleencouraging each other, appealing to each other; false maximsaffecting to teach.  12. This  the world , a creation of the fleshour third great enemy.  13. Thus fallen man has to fight against three great enemies.  14. Let us  never forget  we are servants and soldiers of Christ, Eph. vi. 11-17."

       Reverence   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  "I bow at Jesu's name, for 'tis the Sign  Of awful mercy towards a guilty line.  Of shameful ancestry, in birth defiled,                 And upwards from a child  Full of unlovely thoughts and rebel aims                 And scorn of judgment-flames,  How without fear can I behold my Life,  The Just assailing sin, and death-stain'd in the strife?   And so, albeit His woe is our release,  Thought of that woe aye dims our earthly peace;  The Life is hidden in a Fount of Blood!                 And this is tidings good  For souls, who, pierced that they have caused  that woe,                 Are fain to share it too:  But for the many, clinging to their lot  Of worldly ease and sloth, 'tis written 'Touch Me not.'

       Now this...  is one of the more perceptive  urlLink articles on the Professor's works   that I've found.  Here's a little sample:  "In reading LOTR one must keep in mind several things relating to character. One important one is that the folk we encounter are, with only a few exceptions, quite extraordinary personages even by the standards of Middle-earth. There is nothing unreasonable or exceptionable about extraordinary characters having, well--extraordinary characters. The noted literary critic (yeah, one of them) Edmund Wilson, in his now-notorious rant against LOTR, complained that Aragorn (who? be patient) had the personality of a well-trained horse, had no "taste for sin." Hmmmm . . . .   Aragorn threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it, and the bright blade of Andúril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out. "Elendil!" he cried. "I am Aragorn son of Arathorn, and am called Elessar, the Elfstone, Dúnadan, the heir of Isildur Elendil's son of Gondor. Here is the Sword that was Broken and is forged again! Will you aid me or thwart me? Choose swiftly!"   Our credibility is supposedly strained by finding that this is not a guy given to putting slugs in parking meters? Such ineffable tomfoolery says a great deal more about critics and the society that supports them than it does about their nominal subjects. In essence, we are being told by Wilson and his sort that nobility of character is a childish fiction--that characters supposedly possessed of it are perforce ill-drawn nonsenses. Even in our mingey everyday reality, we know that that is not so. Why need it be a requirement of fiction?"

       The Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ  is today. There is information on it  urlLink here .   Fr. Michael has posted the text of his homily for today  urlLink here.  ( I will add that in the spoken homily he added that he certainly does  not  recommend watching the movie he refers to- he only saw the edited-for-TV version years ago and found it mostly repulsive, but that one line struck him as perceptive.)   "O my dear Saviour, would that I had any right to ask to be allowed to make reparation to Thee for all the unbelief of the world, and all the insults offered to Thy Name, Thy Word, Thy Church, and the Sacrament of Thy Love! But, alas, I have a long score of unbelief and ingratitude of my own to atone for. Thou art in the Sacrifice of the Mass, Thou art in the Tabernacle, verily and indeed, in flesh and blood; and the world not only disbelieves, but mocks at this gracious truth. Thou didst warn us long ago by Thyself and by Thy Apostles that Thou wouldest hide Thyself from the world. The prophecy is fulfilled more than ever now; but  I  know what the world knows not. O accept my homage, my praise, my adoration!let me at least not be found wanting. I cannot help the sins of othersbut one at least of those whom Thou hast redeemed shall turn round and with a loud voice glorify God. The more men scoff, the more will I believe in Thee, the good God, the good Jesus, the hidden Lord of life, who hast done me nothing else but good from the very first moment that I began to live."- Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. Here is one classic prayer honoring Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament:  "Anima Christi, sanctifica me. Corpus Christi, salva me. Sanguis Christi, inebria me. Aqua lateris Christi, lava me. Passio Christi, conforta me. O bone Iesu, exaudi me. Intra tua vulnera absconde me. Ne permittas me separari a te. Ab hoste maligno defende me. In hora mortis meae voca me. Et iube me venire ad te, Ut cum Sanctis tuis laudem te in saecula saeculorum.  Amen."   Here is the Venerable's rather free translation:  "Soul of Christ, be my sanctification; Body of Christ, be my salvation; Blood of Christ, fill all my veins; Water of Christs side, wash out my stains; Passion of Christ, my comfort be; O good Jesu, listen to me; In thy wounds I fain would hide, Neer to be parted from Thy side; Guard me, should the foe assail me; Call me when my life shall fail me; Bid me come to Thee above, With Thy saints to sing Thy love,        World without end. Amen."  Here is my favorite prayer for use before the Blessed Sacrament:   In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.   I place myself in the presence of Him, in whose Incarnate Presence I am before I place myself there.  I adore Thee, O my Saviour, present here as God and man, in soul and body, in true flesh and blood.  I acknowledge and confess that I kneel before that Sacred Humanity, which was conceived in Mary's womb, and lay in Mary's bosom; which grew up to man's estate, and by the Sea of Galilee called the Twelve, wrought miracles, and spoke words of wisdom and peace; which in due season hung on the cross, lay in the tomb, rose from the dead, and now reigns in heaven.  I praise, and bless, and give myself wholly to Him, who is the true Bread of my soul, and my everlasting joy.  - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  All of the quotes from the Venerable are from  urlLink Meditations and Devotions .   Finally, a quote from the Professor: "I put before you the one great thing to love on earth:the Blessed Sacrament.... There you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon earth, and more than that: Death, by the divine paradox, that which ends life and demands the surrender of all, and yet, by the taste (or foretaste) of which alone can what you seek in your earthly relationships (love, faithfulness, joy) be maintained, or take on that complexion of reality, of eternal endurance, which every man's heart desires."

       For Saturday    The special prerogatives of St. Mary, the  Virgo Virginum , are intimately involved in the doctrine of the Incarnation itself, with which these remarks began, and have already been dwelt upon above. As is well known, they were not fully recognised in the Catholic ritual till a late date, but they were not a new thing in the Church, or strange to her earlier teachers. St. Justin, St. Irenæus, and others, had distinctly laid it down, that she not only had an office, but bore a part, and was a voluntary agent, in the actual process of redemption, as Eve had been instrumental and responsible in Adam's fall. They taught that, as the first woman might have foiled the Tempter and did not, so, if Mary had been disobedient or unbelieving on Gabriel's message, the Divine Economy would have been frustrated. And certainly the parallel between "the Mother of all living" and the Mother of the Redeemer may be gathered from a comparison of the first chapters of Scripture with the last. It was noticed in a former place, that the only passage where the serpent is directly identified with the evil spirit occurs in the twelfth chapter of the Revelation; now it is observable that the recognition, when made, is found in the course of a vision of a "woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet:" thus two women are brought into contrast with each other. Moreover, as it is said in the Apocalypse, "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went about to make war with the remnant of her seed," so is it prophesied in Genesis, "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her Seed. He shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise His heel." Also the enmity was to exist, not only between the Serpent and the Seed of the woman, but between the serpent and the woman herself; and here too there is a correspondence in the Apocalyptic vision. If then there is reason for thinking that this mystery at the close of the Scripture record answers to the mystery in the beginning of it, and that "the Woman" mentioned in both passages is one and the same, then she can be none other than St. Mary, thus introduced prophetically to our notice immediately on the transgression of Eve.  - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine

       On June 25, 1846  Venerable John Henry Newman, who had been received into the Catholic Church the previous October, wrote a letter to a friend who was still struggling with whether or not he should do the same: "I still think you are short of fair, short of deep, in your statement of the question. You consider that practices first exist, and are developed into doctrines and this is your main view of development. 'Where there has been a real development,' you say, 'the  practice  (sic)  always  (sic) existed which implied the later doctrine; but where the doctrine is really novel, and not merely developed, the practice which springs from it is novel also.'  Well then, what do you say to St. Augustine and St. Basil not being baptized in infancy? Could the "practice" of infant baptism, in Africa, in Asia Minor, have been, up to the fourth century, what it is nowand they have been left without the Sacrament by pious mothers? What would be said to you now, if you left your child unbaptized? Would you not have to encounter a cry of horror on all sides? The practice then of infant baptism was not established or received for some hundred years. Yet do you deny the doctrine that that sacrament is the one ordinary means of salvation? why not? for you say that 'practical obedience to Rome is later than the doctrinal theory'and is not the practical application of baptism to infants later than the theory of its necessity?  I am far from denying that infant baptism was known from the first ages; I only say that it was not received in the sense it was afterwards. On the other hand I can only lift up my hands in astonishment at your statement that 'the fact is, the Churches did not know or dream of any authority of Rome over them.' Not the Alexandrian Church for instanceof whom Pope Julius, as St. Athanasius vouches, says, 'Are you ignorant that the custom has been for word to be written first to us, and then for a just sentence to be passed from this place?' While St. Dionysius was actually appealed against to Rome, and responded to the appeal.  Nor have you gone to the bottom of the case of the Immensus Filius. It is not that the early Fathers held it, but 'did not express themselves uniformly,' but with 'inaccuracies.' Not sothey denied the doctrine. Their denial, it being almost a  consensus , is a far stronger fact than the fact of St. Cyprian, in a personal, or national matter, and on a point in which after all he was mistaken, opposing the Pope, while he elsewhere maintains his authority.  The fact I believe to be thisthe early Fathers made incorrect intellectual developments of portions or aspects of that whole Catholic doctrine which they held, and so far were inconsistent with themselves. Their opinions contradicted their implicit faithand they said and held things which they would have shrunk from, had they seen, as heretics afterwards exhibited, that they were really destructive of the doctrine of Christ. Yet they really held them; I will not explain away the fact, nor must you. I really do not think you can deny, that the Fathers, not merely did not contemplate true propositions, 'afterwards established' but actually contemplated false. In like manner from a view of the great benefits of baptism, they untruly developed and acted on the proposition 'Therefore it is good to defer it.'  So far from agreeing with your general principle, I consider it quite as true to say that doctrine ever came first, and practice was its development. Bishop Butler implies it, when he speaks of the knowledge of relations imposing duties. And in matter of fact the whole ritual system is a later development of the original creed. I suspect you will find less of processions and vestments than of Papal supremacy in the ages of persecution.  As to the George Ryders. I am sorry to hear you do not like their mode of acting. Do not, however, fear for her noli timere . There is a grace in the Catholic Church which is not lightly got rid of and it binds the soul tight. Keble speaks somewhere of the weakness of things of earth to tempt one 'who once has tasted of immortal truth.' That it may be your blessed lot, Carissime, to receive the offer of that treasure and not to reject it, is the constant prayer of  Your affectionate friend, J. H. N. "  The friend the Venerable addressed in this letter was received into the Church in 1850.

       On June 23, 1872  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:  The World Rejecting God  "1. All men like to be independent and have their own way, and in many things they can profitably be so and get on more to their advantage than when they are under rule, but  2. In one thing they cannotin religion and duty.  3. And for this reason: because we are made up of two principles which war against each other. One or other must be the master.  4. Satan knew this, both man's desire to be independent and the impossibility of it. He knew that man must either be God's servant or his own, and that he, man, did not know this. So he tempted him with, 'Ye shall be as gods,' and waited securely for his consequent falling under his own power.  5. Therefore man, rejecting his true Lord, admitted a usurper. This brings in atheism, i.e. idolatry with immorality. And therefore he always tends to get worse and worse, and unless God interfered he would become unbearable.  6. But God has always pleaded with man ('My spirit shall not always,' etc., and 'The Spirit intercedes'), and thus reserved a remnant. This remnant has pleaded for the world and saved it. It is the salt of the earth.   7. The delugetill only eight persons. Earth filled with violence. 'They ate and drank,' etc.  8. Sodom. 'If ten persons.'  9. When our Lord came. Rom. i.  10. Ever since, it has been the elect few who have saved the world and the Church.  11. When at length 'He shall not find faith on the earth,' He 'cometh.'  12. On what in this age takes the place of professed idolatry, and is really atheism."

       Pusillanimity   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   "I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?"    "How didst thou start, Thou Holy Baptist, bid      To pour repentance on the Sinless Brow!  Then all thy meekness, from thy hearers hid,      Beneath the Ascetic's port, and Preacher's fire,  Flow'd forth, and with a pang thou didst desire       He might be chief, not thou.   And so on us at whiles it falls, to claim      Powers that we dread, or dare some forward part;  Nor must we shrink as cravens from the blame      Of pride, in common eyes, or purpose deep;  But with pure thoughts look up to God, and keep       Our secret in our heart. "    At Sea. June 22, 1833.

"Good Lord, give me the grace to so spend my life, that when the day of my death shall come, though I may feel pain in my body, I may feel comfort in my soul; and with the faithful hope of Thy mercy, in due love towards Thee and charity towards the world, I may, through Thy grace, part hence into Thy glory.

       On June 21, 1852...  the  urlLink Achilli trial  began. You see, Venerable Newman had dared, in a series of lactures later published as  urlLink Lectures on the Present Position of Catholics in England  to remark that one of the 'ex-priests' currently lecturing in England about how vile and vicious the Catholic Church was had been expelled from the priesthood for sexual offenses. Here is the passage.  "Ah! Dr. Achilli, I might have spoken of him last week, had time admitted of it. The Protestant world flocks to hear him, because he has something to tell of the Catholic Church. He has something to tell, it is true; he has a scandal to reveal, he has an argument to exhibit. It is a simple one, and a powerful one, as far as it goesand it is one. That one argument is himself; it is his presence which is the triumph of Protestants; it is the sight of him which is a Catholic's confusion. It is indeed our great confusion, that our Holy Mother could have had a priest like him. He feels the force of the argument, and he shows himself to the multitude that is gazing on him. 'Mothers of families,' he seems to say, 'gentle maidens, innocent children, look at me, for I am worth looking at. You do not see such a sight every day. Can any church live over the imputation of such a production as I am? I have been a Catholic and an infidel; I have been a Roman priest and a hypocrite; I have been a profligate under a cowl. I am that Father Achilli, who, as early as 1826, was deprived of my faculty to lecture, for an offence which my superiors did their best to conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young woman of eighteen; who in September, 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, in the case of a person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 and 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fifteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes and Good Friday for another. Look on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye "ne'er may look upon my like again." I am that veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by my teaching. I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer. I am that Professor in the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.'"    Achilli promptly sued for libel, and though the Venerable gathered a great deal of evidence, all of it was dismissed by the jurors as worthless and Newman was found guilty. The  Times , hardly sympathetic to the Catholic cause, nevertheless remarked upon this miscarriage of justice. "We consider that a great blow has been given to the administration of justice in this country, and that Roman Catholics will henceforth have only too good reason for asserting that there is no justice for them in cases tending to arouse the Protestant feelings of judges and juries."  For several months, the Venerable had to worry over whether or not he would be sent to jail, but he was given a relatively small fine instead- probably because the judge was afraid of even more bad publicity. Meanwhile Achilli left the country, his reputation gone, and the gratitude of Catholics in England and elsewhere to Newman for standing up for the Faith was immense. So many people sent donations to cover the court costs that the leftover money was used to build a church. Venerable Newman was thankful for the support. The dedication of his  urlLink next book   ran: " Hospes eram, et collegistis Me.     IN GRATEFUL NEVER-DYING REMEMBRANCE   OF HIS MANY FRIENDS AND BENEFACTORS,  LIVING AND DEAD,  AT HOME AND ABROAD  IN GREAT BRITAIN, IRELAND, FRANCE,   IN BELGIUM, GERMANY, POLAND, ITALY, AND MALTA,   IN NORTH AMERICA, AND OTHER COUNTRIES,   WHO, BY THEIR RESOLUTE PRAYERS AND PENANCE,   AND BY THEIR GENEROUS STUBBORN EFFORTS,   AND BY THEIR MUNIFICENT ALMS,   HAVE BROKEN FOR HIM THE STRESS   OF A GREAT ANXIETY,   THESE DISCOURSES,   OFFERED TO OUR LADY AND ST. PHILIP ON ITS RISE,   COMPOSED UNDER ITS PRESSURE,   FINISHED ON THE EVE OF ITS TERMINATION,   ARE RESPECTFULLY AND AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED   BY THE AUTHOR.   IN FEST. PRÆSENT.  B. M. V. NOV. 21, 1852."

       Human stupidity...  never ceaases  urlLink to amaze me.  Apparenly these folks are claiming that  warning black mothers that their unborn children are targets   is racist.  Link courtesy of  urlLink Zorak .   This reminds me of a situation that happened around here some years ago. A local artist, whom I happened to know, was slammed as racist because one of his paintings contained a dead, black adolescent. What his critics didn't notice was that the painting was called  Pieta . It was a lovely portrait of a beautiful black matron, cradling her dead son tenderly in her arms, while stepping on a jacket bearing gang colors the way Our Lady traditionally steps on the Serpent in Catholic art. The painter, who is a devout Catholic, knew a black family who son was killed, an innocent victim of gang violence. He was  honoring  the suffering of such victims and their families by connecting them with the suffering of Our Lord and Our Lady, but all those critics saw was "White artist paints dead black kid- he must want more black kids to be killed."

       The Feast of St. Aloysius Gonzaga, S.J.   is today. There is information on him  urlLink here.  It is also the feast of  urlLink St. John Rigby, Martyr . I must add a note to the little biography at the link: when the saint stated, "I am a bachelor; and more than that I am a maid", it is, in all probablity not his job as a servant that he was referring to by that second statement. "Maid" or "maiden" was the common term for "virgin" , so he was saying that not only was he not married, but he had kept his virginity.

       From  Parochial and Plain Sermons   by Venerable Joh Henry Newman, C.O. "He says, 'If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.' [Luke ix. 23.] Here He shows us from His own example what Christian self-denial is. It is taking on us a cross after His pattern, not a mere refraining from sin, for He had no sin, but a giving up what we might lawfully use. This was the peculiar character in which Christ came on earth. It was this spontaneous and exuberant self-denial which brought Him down. He who was one with God, took upon Him our nature, and suffered deathand why? to save us whom He needed not save. Thus He denied Himself, and took up His cross. This is the very aspect, in which God, as revealed in Scripture, is distinguished from that exhibition of His glory, which nature gives us: power, wisdom, love, mercy, long-sufferingthese attributes, though far more fully and clearly displayed in Scripture than in nature, still are in their degree seen on the face of the visible creation; but self-denial, if it may be said, this incomprehensible attribute of Divine Providence, is disclosed to us only in Scripture. 'God so loved the world that He gave His Son.' [John iii. 16.] Here is self-denial. And the Son of God so loved us, that "though He was rich yet for our sakes He became poor." [2 Cor. viii. 9.] Here is our Saviour's self-denial. 'He pleased not Himself.'  And what Christ did when He came on earth, that have all His saints done both before and since His coming."

       The Feast of St. Thomas, Apostle and Martyr  is today. There is information on him  urlLink here .     Returning, then, to what I said when I began, we see now how it was that our Lord praised easiness of belief, and condemned hardness of belief. To be easy in believing is nothing more or less than to have been ready to inquire; to be hard of belief is nothing else but to have been loth and reluctant to inquire. Those whose faith He praised had no stronger evidence than those whose unbelief He condemned; but they had used their eyes, used their reason, exerted their minds, and persevered in inquiry till they found; while the others, whose unbelief He condemned, had heard indeed, but had let the divine seed lie by the roadside, or in the rocky soil, or among the thorns which choked it. And here I am led to say, what seems to me, as far as it is reverent to conjecture it, the fault of the holy Apostle St. Thomas. He said that he would not believe that our Lord had risen, unless he actually saw Him. What! is there not more than one way of arriving at faith in Christ? are there not a hundred proofs, distinct from each other, and all good ones? Was there no way of being sure He came from God, except that of seeing the great miracle of the resurrection? Surely there were many others; but St. Thomas prescribed the only mode in which he would consent to believe in Him. This was the case of his countrymen also, for in this point he only did what they had done. The Jews had long been the people of God, and they had the writings of the Prophets. The fulfilment of the prophecies in the Person of our Lord was the most obvious and natural evidence to the Jews that He was the Messias; but they would not accept this evidence, and determined to have another. They determined to be convinced in one particular way, viz., by miracles; and when, out of the superabundant mercy of God, miracles were wrought before their eyes, then they would choose the special kind of miracle which was to convince them, and would not believe, unless it was a miracle to their liking. And hence it was that our Lord said, as I have already quoted His words: "Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye believe not." Hence too He said, on other occasions: "O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all things which the  Prophets  have spoken." And: "If they hear not Moses and the  Prophets , neither will they believe if one rise again from the dead." And: "An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign, and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the  Prophet ." And hence the Jews of Thessalonica are censured, and the Bereans, on the contrary, praised, "who received the word with all eagerness, daily  searching the Scriptures , whether these things were so." It is added, "and many of them  believed ." And therefore, in the instance of St. Thomas, I say that, when he was so slow to believe, his fault lay in thinking he had a right to be fastidious, and to pick and choose by what arguments he would be convinced, instead of asking himself whether he had not enough to convince him already; just as if, forsooth, it were a great matter to his Lord that he should believe, and no matter at all to himself. And therefore it was, that, while Christ so graciously granted him the kind of proof he desired, He said to him for our sakes: "Because thou hath seen Me, Thomas, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed."

       On July 2, 1871  Venerable John Henry Newman,C.O.,preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive. It was apparently preached in support of the refurbishing of a church, at the request of the pastor.       The Visible Temple   'Whether you eat, or drink, or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God,' 1 Cor. x. 31.  1. What do these words mean? What do they enjoin upon us? {210}  2. We have our duty towards God, our neighbour, and ourselves. Now we may in a certain way fulfil these duties without doing them to God's glory.  3.  E.g.   we may do our duty to God from mere fear, or from habit, or from human respect; from expedience,  e.g.   going to Communion once a year, saying prayers, keeping from particular sinsbeing respectablethis right, but not enough. To our neighbour from pity, from benevolence, from family affectionsthis too, good, but not enough. And so to ourselves. We may be virtuous, and proud or self-conceited. That is, we may do things good, and in a certain sense be good in doing them, yet  not to the glory of God , i.e. because  not from love . This is one thing, then, that is meant by the text.  4. Then again, what is meant by doing  all things ? We have only rare opportunities of doing our duty. How can we eat and drink to [the glory of God]?  5. (1) Eating and drinking. (2) Use of the tonguebad conversation. (3) Readingcuriosity. (4) Amusements in kind and in reason . (5) Workidleness, justice. (6) Sickness. (7) Punishments and penances.  6. Thus the whole day'Pray without ceasing'Matt. v. 16, Phil. iv. 8 .  And so especially the worship of God. God has told us to pray. Now let us apply this to the service of God. To pray together, and publicly. This implies, of course, rites of religion, and buildings to perform them in. How can these be done to God's glory? Now, I can understand men saying, 'No religious rites, no common worship; religion is private and personal.' But I cannot understand [them] saying, 'It is common and public, it has rites, it has houses,' and not to bring those houses under the commandment of glorifying God, being edifying, etc.  7. Now how do we glorify God in religious houses or churches? In making them  devotional . No matter what architecture, etc.,  devotional  is the end, towards God and towards men.  8. And costly ('of that which cost me nothing,' etc.) as a means of expressing devotionAggeus i., Isa. lx. [13], Apoc. xxi. . Hence David, 1 Par. xvii.Ps. cxxxi. ( memento Domine , David); 1 Par. xxix .[his] zeal for the house of God; his singers, his psalmsi Par. xxv . This made him  according to His own heart  [1 Kings xiii. 14].  9. Now you know what this tends to. Why is it that I come before you today? It is because I felt a profound appreciation of the work in which your priest was engaged, and a true sympathy in his exertions. I recognised in him a zeal for the honour of God's house such as that of David, whose spirit was troubled that his God had no abode fit for Him. I knew that for years and years his spirit chafed within him that he could not perfect in this place that idea of solemnity and beautifulness in the visible temple which he had in his mind. Twenty years and more, to my knowledge, has this idea occupied his mind. Then, too, he honoured me by asking me to take here some part in promoting his work, which he has committed to me now. Then he did a partand now, by his persevering zeal, and the munificence of pious men, he has been able to do more; and he urges you, through me, to take part in, and to complete his service of zeal and love. And in the next place he calls [you] to a religious act in a religious way. He appeals to you on a Sunday, not on Monday, Tuesday, etc. He has taken the legitimate ecclesiastical means of asking for your contributions, which is possible on a Sunday. He does not take means of raising money which are not possible on a Sunday; he does a sacred work on a sacred day.  [Further], his object has special claims from the circumstances of this church. It is the mother church of Birmingham. It is dedicated to St. Peter. In subscribing to it you are testifying your loyalty to the Holy See in its troubles. Lastly, on the feast of the Visitation, when all Nature rejoices and Mary sings the  Magnificat 2 Cor. viii. 7.

       My friend Jerry  was sent this by a friend of his, and he requested that I post it on my blog.     Date: Sun, 20 Jun 2004 15:16:47 -0400 (EDT) From: Mischa Gelman   To: Gerald J Nora   Subject: Notes from initial Democrats for Life of PA meeting   Jerry,   Please pass these along to anyone who may be interested. This is the summary of our first meeting to organize a state branch of Democrats for Life. If the student groups would be interested in a presentation once things are organized, I'm sure it could be arranged.  Notes from the Democrats for Life meeting of 6/13/04 in Pittsburgh:  Creating a Pennsylvanian Chapter - While there has been a Democrats for Life contact in Pennsylvania James Minicozzi), no incorporation papers have been filed and Lt. Minicozzi is presently stationed in Iraq - To incorporate in Pennsylvania, we need a board of directors, bylaws and a mailing address. There also may be a filing fee - Bylaws of National DFLA were reviewed and can be adopted as a basis for the state chapter. - Once we have a list of charter members and board members, we should create an advisory board of pro-life Democratic officeholders. Pat Casey may be willing to lend a hand in making calls.  Website, mailing list, other technological issues - While Democrats for Life has a national email list, a state-specific list would be a good idea to help people remain in contact, notify one another of pending legislation on the state level and inform folks of pro-life Democratic candidates running for state office - Both Erin Devlin and Michael Collins have volunteered to do web design. Mr. Collins also will check with folks at Carnegie Mellon University who may be willing to lend a hand. - Michael Collins will have a proposal for computer setup ready by 6/30  Potential sources of members - LEARN (a pro-life African-American group) has been a good source for Democrats for Life in other areas. Jay Ware of Democrats for Life of Illinois was emailed to see if he knew of any local contacts - The Catholic Church does not want to get involved in any partisan issues and the secretary for social concerns in the Pittsburgh Diocese did not return a call, but the Oratory stated that they would accept information in case anyone contacted them - Other potential recruitment options raised were PLAGL, anti-death penalty groups, People Concerned for the Unborn Child, the Merton Center and student pro-life groups at the local universities - Feminists for Life does not release names on its mailing list  State Chapters - The progress of existing chapters was reviewed. Among projects that are presently being done are rallies, meetings of pro-life state representatives, press conferences, contacts with the state and county parties (in some states the Democratic Party has web links to the local Democrats for Life or distributes our literature in their offices). - Many chapters are just getting off the ground and none is older than 5 years, so we're not alone in starting from a minimal base. A date for going public could well be within 6-12 months. Once we have a strong base of members, elected officials and an organized structure we should be able to get some press attention  Other Notes - Brendan Boyle is running for office in the Philadelphia area. He is presently busy with his campaign but would be a possible leadership candidate for Democrats for Life of Pennsylvania should his campaign be unsuccessful. His campaign manager, Dan Lotise, also would be a good option as president of DFLA in Pennsylvania - Pat Casey may lead an effort to start a pro-life Democratic PAC, possibly to be named Casey Democrats in honor of our former governor and present auditor general. Democrats for Life of America serves as a lobbying group, not a PAC - Some chapters have been approached by Republicans who are interested in lending a hand. Members of Democrats for Life must be Democrats or else we run the risk of being accused of being a front group for the Republicans   No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main...Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee - John Donne    I'm afraid I gave up on the Democratic Party about a decade ago (and am less than sanguine about the Republican Party as well), but an attempt to break up the  pro-death monopoly in a major political party certainly deserves our prayers.

       Those sounds you hear...  are  urlLink St. Bridget of Sweden  and  urlLink St. Catherine of Sweden  spinning in their graves.   urlLink Swedish pastor sentenced to one month in jail for offending homosexuals .   I will admit that, from the article, it sounds as if the pastor was not exactly charitable, but this is still outrageous. ( I wonder if the pastor did not mention that the temptation to act in a sexually perverted manner can be resisted with the help of God's grace, or, more likely, the reporter simply neglected to report his mention of it ? )

       On July 1, 1879  Venerable John Henry  Cardinal  Newman. C.O., returned to the Birmingham Oratory after the trip to Rome during which he was elevated to the cardinalate. Fr. Henry Ignatius Dudley Ryder, C.O.,wrote about that day.     'No one I am sure who was privileged to be present, will ever forget that improvised service of thanksgiving for his safe return in which he took part immediately on his arrival. He was wonderful to look upon as he sat fronting the congregation, his face as the face of an angelthe features that were so familiar to us refined and spiritualised by illness and the delicate complexion and silver hair touched by the rose tints of his bright unaccustomed dress. Leaning his head upon his hand he began to talk to us and must have spoken for some twenty minutes or more. Every word seemed preciousI can only hope they have been preservedand yet simple to the last degree; about home principally.  If I remember right he began with the words "It is such a happiness to get home." There was throughout what was often a peculiar charm with him, the impression of aloofness as though it were all a soliloquy or conversation you had innocently surprised.'   Fr. Ryder's hope was partially realized- someone did write down the Venerable's words, though apparently it was not him.     'My dear Children,I am desirous of thanking you for the great sympathy you have shown towards me, for your congratulations, for your welcome, and for your good prayers; but I feel so very weakfor I have not recovered yet from a long illnessthat I hardly know how I can be able to say ever so few words, or to express in any degree the great pleasure and gratitude to you which I feel.   'To come home again! In that word "home" how much is included. I know well that there is a more heroic life than a home life. We know the blessed Apostleshow they went about, and we listen to St. Paul's wordsthose touching wordsin which he speaks of himself and says he was an outcast. Then we know, too, our Blessed Lordthat He "had not where to lay His head." Therefore, of course, there is a higher life, a more heroic life, than that of home. But still, that is given to few. The home lifethe idea of homeis consecrated to us by our patron and founder St. Philip, for he made the idea of home the very essence of his religion and institute. We have even a great example in Our Lord Himself; for though in His public ministry He had not where to lay His head, yet we know that for the first thirty years of His life He had a home, and He therefore consecrated, in a special way, the life of home. And as, indeed, Almighty God has been pleased to continue the world, not, as angels, by a separate creation of each, but by means of the Family, so it was fitting that the congregation of St. Philip should be the ideal, the realisation of the Family in its perfection, and a pattern to every family in the parish, in the town, and throughout the whole of Christendom. Therefore, I do indeed feel pleasure to come home again. Although I am not insensible of the great grace of being in the Holy City, which is the centre of grace, nor of the immense honour which has been conferred upon me, nor of the exceeding kindness and affection to me personally of the Holy FatherI may say more than affection, for he was to me as though he had been all my life my fatherto see the grace which shone from his face and spoke in his voice; yet I feel I may rejoice in coming home againas if it were to my long hometo that home which extends to heaven, "the home of our eternity." And although there has been much of sickness, and much sadness in being prevented from enjoying the privileges of being in the Holy City, yet Almighty God has brought me home again in spite of all difficulties, fears, obstacles, troubles, and trials. I almost feared I should never come back, but God in His mercy has ordered it otherwise. And now I will ask you, my dear friends, to pray for me, that I may be as the presence of the Holy Father amongst you, and that the Holy Spirit of God may be upon this Church, upon this great city, upon its Bishop, upon all its priests, upon all its inhabitants, men, women and children, and as a pledge and beginning of it, I give you my benediction.'

       On June 30, 1851  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., delivered the first of the lectures which were eventually published as  urlLink Lectures on the Present Position of Catholics in England . ( A thank-you to  urlLink Lane Core  for sending me a reminder of this. )    These lectures are perhaps the finest examples of Venerable Newman's brilliantly sarcastic side. They were delivered at a time when Catholics were being treated even more poorly than usual, due to them having had the 'insolence' to actually reestablish a hierarchy of bishops in England. This resulted in huge meetings featuring speakers denouncing "Popery", burnings of the Pope and the new bishops in effigy, and some attacks on Catholic churches and priests. The Venerable himself had to deal with someone dumping the contents of an entire bag of flour on him from a second story, while the London Oratorians had the more serious problem of an attempt to set fire to their house with firecrackers on November 5, 1850. There was even a rumor spread about that the reason there was a cellar being built in the new house for the Birmingham Oratory was so that people could be tortured and killed without the neighbors knowing ! And, insane though this was, this accusation was actually brought  to the floor of Parliament , in a speech which the Venerable quotes. Things got to the point where an Anglican clergyman called from the pulpit for making the hearing of Confessions a capital crime. In his lectures, the Venerable was attempting to demonstrate just how absurd this sort of nonsense was, and defuse some of the insanity with laughter.  Here are a few samples- the first has to do with the 'murders in the cellars' stupidity:   Coaches, omnibuses, carriages, and cars, day after day drive up and down the Hagley Road; passengers lounge to and fro on the foot-path; and close alongside of it are discovered one day the nascent foundations and rudiments of a considerable building. On inquiring, it is found to be intended for a Catholic, nay, even for a monastic establishment. This leads to a good deal of talk, especially when the bricks begin to show above the surface. Meantime the unsuspecting architect is taking his measurements, and ascertains that the ground is far from lying level; and then, since there is a prejudice among Catholics in favour of horizontal floors, he comes to the conclusion that the bricks of the basement must rise above the surface higher at one end of the building than at the other; in fact, that whether he will or no, there must be some construction of the nature of a vault or cellar at the extremity in question, a circumstance not at all inconvenient, considering it also happens to be the kitchen end of the building. Accordingly, he turns his necessity into a gain, and by the excavation of a few feet of earth, he forms a number of chambers convenient for various purposes, partly beneath, partly above the line of the ground. While he is thus intent on his work, loungers, gossipers, alarmists are busy at theirs too. They go round the building, they peep into the underground brickwork, and are curious about the drains ; they moralise about Popery and its spread; at length they trespass upon the enclosure, they dive into the half-finished shell, and they take their fill of seeing what is to be seen, and imagining what is not. Every house is built on an idea; you do not build a mansion like a public office, or a palace like a prison, or a factory like a shooting box, or a church like a barn. Religious houses, in like manner, have their own idea; they have certain indispensable peculiarities of form and internal arrangement. Doubtless, there was much in the very idea of an Oratory perplexing to the Protestant intellect, and inconsistent with Protestant notions of comfort and utility. Why should so large a room be here? why so small a room there? why a passage so long and wide? and why so long a wall without a window? the very size of the house needs explanation. Judgments which had employed themselves on the high subject of a Catholic hierarchy and its need, found no difficulty in dogmatising on bedrooms and closets. There was much to suggest matter of suspicion, and to predispose the trespasser to doubt whether he had yet got to the bottom of the subject. At length one question flashed upon his mind: what can such a house have to do with cellars? cellars and monks, what can be their mutual relation? monksto what possible use can they put pits, and holes, and corners, and outhouses, and sheds? A sensation was created; it brought other visitors; it spread; it became an impression, a belief; the truth lay bare; a tradition was born; a fact was elicited which henceforth had many witnesses.  Those cellars were cells.  How obvious when once stated! and every one who entered the building, every one who passed by, became, I say, in some sort, ocular vouchers for what had often been read of in books, but for many generations had happily been unknown to England, for the incarcerations, the torturings, the starvings, the immurings, the murderings proper to a monastic establishment.  Now I am tempted to stop for a while in order to  improve  (as the evangelical pulpits call it) this most memorable discovery. I will therefore briefly consider it under the heads of1. THE ACCUSATION; 2. ITS GROUNDS; 3. THE ACCUSERS; and, 4. THE ACCUSED.  FirstTHE ACCUSATION.It is this,that the Catholics, building the house in question, were in the practice of committing  murder . This was so strictly the charge, that, had the platform selected for making it been other than we know it to have been, I suppose the speaker might have been indicted for libel. His words were these:"It was not usual for a coroner to hold an  inquest  unless where a rumour had got abroad that there was a  necessity  for one; and how was a rumour to come  from the underground cells of the convents?  Yes, he repeated, underground cells: and he would tell them something about such places. At this moment, in the parish of Edgbaston, within the borough of Birmingham, there was a large convent, of some kind or other, being erected, and the whole of the underground was fitted up with cells;  and what were those cells for?"   Secondly.THE GROUNDS OF THE ACCUSATION.they are simple; behold them: 1. That the house is built level; 2. and that the plot of earth on which it is built is higher at one end than at the other.  Thirdly.THE ACCUSERS.This, too, throws light upon the character of Protestant traditions. Not weak and ignorant people only, not people at a distancebut educated men, gentlemen well connected, high in position, men of business, men of character, members of the legislature, men familiar with the locality, men who know the accused by name,such are the men who deliberately, reiteratedly, in spite of being set right, charge certain persons with pitiless, savage practices; with beating and imprisoning, with starving, with murdering their dependents.  Fourthly.THE ACCUSED.I feel ashamed, my Brothers, of bringing my own matters before you, when far better persons have suffered worse imputations; but bear with me. I then am the accused. A gentleman of blameless character, a county member, with whose near relatives I have been on terms of almost fraternal intimacy for a quarter of a century, who knows me by repute far more familiarly (I suppose) than anyone in this room knows me, putting aside my personal friends; he it is who charges me, and others like me, with delighting in blood, with enjoying the shrieks and groans of agony and despair, with presiding at a banquet of dislocated limbs,quivering muscles, and wild countenances. Oh, what a world is this! Could he look into our eyes and say it? Would he have the heart to say it, if he recollected of whom he said it? For who are we? Have we lived in a corner? have we come to light suddenly out of the earth? We have been nourished, for the greater part of our lives, in the bosom of the great schools and universities of Protestant England: we have been the foster sons of the Edwards and Henries, the Wykehams and Wolseys, of whom Englishmen are wont to make much; we have grown up amid hundreds of contemporaries, scattered at present all over the country, in those special ranks of society which are the very walk of a member of the legislature. Our names are better known to the educated classes of the country than those of any others who are not public men. Moreover, if there be men in the whole world who may be said to live  in publico , it is the members of a College at one of our Universities; living, not in private houses, not in families, but in one or two apartments which are open to all the world, at all hours, with nothing, I may say, their own; with college servants, a common table,nay, their chairs and their bedding, and their cups and saucers, down to their coal-scuttle and their carpet brooms,a sort of common property, and the right of their neighbours. Such is that manner of life,in which nothing, I may say, can be hid; where no trait of character or peculiarity of conduct but comes to broad daysuch is the life I myself led for above a quarter of a century, under the eyes of numbers who are familiarly known to my accusers; such is almost the life which we all have led ever since we have been in Birmingham, with our house open to all comers, and ourselves accessible, I may almost say at any hour; and this being so, considering the  charge , and the  evidence , and the  accuser , and the  accused , could we Catholics desire a more apposite illustration of the formation and the value of a Protestant Tradition?  I set it down for the benefit of time to come; "though for no other cause," as a great author says, "yet for this: that posterity may know we have not loosely, through silence, permitted things to pass away as in a dream, there shall be for men's information extant thus much." One commonly forgets such things, from the trouble and inconvenience of having to remember them; let one specimen last, of many which have been suffered to perish, of the birth of an anti-Catholic tradition.  The nascent fable has indeed failed, as the tale about the Belgian sin-table has failed, but it might have thriven: it has been lost by bad nursing; it ought to have been cherished awhile in those underground receptacles where first it drew breath, till it could comfortably bear the light; till its limbs were grown, and its voice was strong, and we on whom it bore had run our course, and gone to our account; and then it might have raised its head without fear and without reproach, and might have magisterially asserted what there was none to deny. But men are all the creatures of circumstances; they are hurried on to a ruin which they may see, but cannot evade: so has it been with the Edgbaston Tradition. It was spoken on the house-tops when it should have been whispered in closets, and it expired in the effort. Yet it might have been allotted, let us never forget, a happier destiny. It might have smouldered and spread through a portion of our Birmingham population; it might have rested obscurely on their memories, and now and then risen upon their tongues; there might have been flitting notions, misgivings, rumours, voices, that the horrors of the Inquisition were from time to time renewed in our subterranean chambers; and fifty years hence, if some sudden frenzy of the hour roused the Anti-Catholic jealousy still lingering in the town, a mob might have swarmed about our innocent dwelling, to rescue certain legs of mutton and pats of butter from imprisonment, and to hold an inquest over a dozen packing-cases, some old hampers, a knife-board, and a range of empty blacking bottles.   Here is one on images:    A Protestant blames Catholics for showing honour to images; yet he does it himself. And first, he sees no difficulty in a mode of treating them, quite as repugnant to his own ideas of what is rational, as the practice he abominates; and that is, the offering insult and mockery to them. Where is the good sense of showing dishonour, if it be stupid and brutish to show honour? Approbation and criticism, praise and blame go together. I do not mean, of course, that you dishonour what you honour; but that the two ideas of honour and dishonour so go together, that where you  can  apply(rightly or wrongly, but still)where it is  possible  to apply the one, it is possible to apply the other. Tell me, then, what is meant by burning Bishops, or Cardinals, or Popes in  effigy ? has it no meaning? is it not plainly intended for an insult? Would any one who was burned in effigy feel it no insult? Well, then, how is it  not  absurd to feel pain at being dishonoured in effigy,  yet  absurd to feel pleasure at being honoured in effigy? How is it childish to honour an image, if it is not childish to dishonour it? This only can a Protestant say in defence of the act which he allows and practises, that he is used to it, whereas to the other he is not used. Honour is a new idea, it comes strange to him; and, wonderful to say, he does not see that he has admitted it in principle already, in admitting dishonour, and after preaching against the Catholic who crowns an image of the Madonna, he complacently goes his way, and sets light to a straw effigy of Guy Fawkes.   But this is not all; Protestants actually set up images to represent their heroes, and they show them honour without any misgiving. The very flower and cream of Protestantism used to glory in the statue of King William on College Green, Dublin; and, though I cannot make any reference in print, I recollect well what a shriek they raised some years ago, when the figure was unhorsed. Some profane person one night applied gunpowder, and blew the king right out of his saddle; and he was found by those who took interest in him, like Dagon, on the ground. You might have thought the poor senseless block had life, to see the way people took on about it, and how they spoke of his face, and his arms, and his legs; yet those same Protestants, I say, would at the same time be horrified, had I used "he" and "him" of a crucifix, and would call me one of the monsters described in the Apocalypse, did I but honour my living Lord as they their dead king.    My personal favorite section is this  urlLink amazing send-up , in which the British government is treated the way a typical 'anti-Popery' speaker would have treated the Catholic Church.

       The Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul, Apostles and Martyrs  is today. There is information on them  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .     We ought to desire to do great things for the service of God, and not content ourselves with a moderate goodness, but wish, if it were possible, to surpass in sanctity and love even St. Peter and St. Paul.   St. Philip Neri     Thus the very presence of Jesus enkindled Peter's heart, and at once drew him unto Him; also at a former time, when he saw his Lord walking on the sea, his very first impulse was, as in the passage to which I have been referring, to leave the vessel and hasten to His side: "Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come to Thee upon the waters". And when he had been betrayed into his great sin, the very Eye of Jesus brought him to himself: "And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, and he went out and wept bitterly". Hence, on another occasion, when many of the disciples fell away, and "Jesus said to the twelve, Do you too wish to go away?" St. Peter answered, "Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life; and we have believed and have known that Thou art Christ, the Son of God."  Such, too, was that other great Apostle, who, in so many ways, is associated with St. Peterthe Doctor of the Gentiles. He indeed was converted miraculously, by our Lord's appearing to him, when he was on his way to carry death to the Christians of Damascus: but how does he speak? "Whether we are beside ourselves," he says, "it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for you: for the charity of Christ constraineth us. If, therefore, any be a new creature in Christ, old things have passed away, behold all things are made new." And so again: "With Christ am I nailed to the cross; but I live, yet no longer I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me". And again: "I am the least of the Apostles, who am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace in me hath not been void, but I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God with me." And once more:"Whether we live, unto the Lord we live; whether we die, unto the Lord we die; whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's". You see, my brethren, the character of St. Paul's love; it was a love fervent, eager, energetic, active, full of great works, "strong as death," as the inspired Word says, a flame which "many waters could not quench, nor the streams drown," which lasted to the end, when he could say, "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; henceforth is laid up for me the crown of justice, which the Lord will render to me at that day, the just Judge".  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Discourses to Mixed Congregations

       From  A Letter Addressed to the Duke of Norfolk on Occasion of Mr. Gladstone's Recent Expostulation   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    The rule and measure of duty is not utility, nor expedience, nor the happiness of the greatest number, nor State convenience, nor fitness, order, and the  pulchrum . Conscience is not a long-sighted selfishness, nor a desire to be consistent with oneself; but it is a messenger from Him, who, both in nature and in grace, speaks to us behind a veil, and teaches and rules us by His representatives. Conscience is the aboriginal Vicar of Christ, a prophet in its informations, a monarch in its peremptoriness, a priest in its blessings and anathemas, and, even though the eternal priesthood throughout the Church could cease to be, in it the sacerdotal principle would remain and would have a sway.  Words such as these are idle empty verbiage to the great world of philosophy now. All through my day there has been a resolute warfare, I had almost said conspiracy against the rights of conscience, as I have described it. Literature and science have been embodied in great institutions in order to put it down. Noble buildings have been reared as fortresses against that spiritual, invisible influence which is too subtle for science and too profound for literature. Chairs in Universities have been made the seats of an antagonist tradition. Public writers, day after day, have indoctrinated the minds of innumerable readers with theories subversive of its claims. As in Roman times, and in the middle age, its supremacy was assailed by the arm of physical force, so now the intellect is put in operation to sap the foundations of a power which the sword could not destroy. We are told that conscience is but a twist in primitive and untutored man; that its dictate is an imagination; that the very notion of guiltiness, which that dictate enforces, is simply irrational, for how can there possibly be freedom of will, how can there be consequent responsibility, in that infinite eternal network of cause and effect, in which we helplessly lie? and what retribution have we to fear, when we have had no real choice to do good or evil?  So much for philosophers; now let us see what is the notion of conscience in this day in the popular mind. There, no more than in the intellectual world, does "conscience" retain the old, true, Catholic meaning of the word. There too the idea, the presence of a Moral Governor is far away from the use of it, frequent and emphatic as that use of it is. When men advocate the rights of conscience, they in no sense mean the rights of the Creator, nor the duty to Him, in thought and deed, of the creature; but the right of thinking, speaking, writing, and acting, according to their judgment or their humour, without any thought of God at all. They do not even pretend to go by any moral rule, but they demand, what they think is an Englishman's prerogative, for each to be his own master in all things, and to profess what he pleases, asking no one's leave, and accounting priest or preacher, speaker or writer, unutterably impertinent, who dares to say a word against his going to perdition, if he like it, in his own way.

       From Sermons on Subjects of the Day  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Elijah, when he had left the wilderness, "found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him." Elisha understood that it was a call to follow the persecuted Prophet in his forlorn course. So he asked his leave to bid his friends farewell. "And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee." God's calls are not commands, but favours; so the Prophet said to him, "Go back again; for what have I done to thee?" but Elisha, though so suddenly visited, had no intention of shrinking from the summons; he asked indeed to bid his kindred farewell, but he was not of those whom our Saviour notices, who, having put their hand to the plough, look back, and are unfit for the kingdom of God [Luke ix. 62.]. He did but wish, before commencing his new life and eventful ministry, to hold a last feast with his friends; and in his mode of doing so, he showed that his mind was made up to leave his former occupations for ever. The materials of his husbandry provided him with an entertainment. "He returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him." [1 Kings xix. 19-21.]

Check out this bit of dialogue involving a couple coming in to plan their wedding (man is a fallen-away Episcopalian, woman a less-than-exemplary Catholic), and the priest who has had to deal with this kind of nonsense one too many times....    "This could go on a long time, Father. I've given my promise. What more do you want?"  He slammed his fist against the desk in a tight, swift gesture that caused Liz to flinch. "I want more than your promise! I want to know there's something holier in your life than your own damn opinion. I'm sick and tired of my Catholic children coming in here with their pagan fianceés,  all  of them, of course, like you, pledging un dy ing love, and then a year or five years later," he snapped his fingers, "it's over." He ceased, allowing the heat beneath his collar to subside, his voice to calm. "Of course," he admitted, "I see quite a few pagan Catholics as well, and they have no cloak for their sin. But it comes to the same thing: many of my flock now live their days in great sorrow because a promise wasn't enough." He leaned forward to fix me with the blue eyes. "What I want to know is that after God joins you beneath the roof of his house, the walls of your marriage will not come tumbling down with the next change in the weather. With  any  change in the weather.  That's  what I want to know."

       For Saturday     If the Mother of Emmanuel ought to be the first of creatures in sanctity and in beauty; if it became her to be free from all sin from the very first, and from the moment she received her first grace to begin to merit more; and if such as was her beginning, such was her end, her conception immaculate and her death an assumption; if she died, but revived, and is exalted on high; what is befitting in the children of such a Mother, but an imitation, in their measure, of her devotion, her meekness, her simplicity, her modesty, and her sweetness? Her glories are not only for the sake of her Son, they are for our sakes also. Let us copy her faith, who received God's message by the angel without a doubt; her patience, who endured St. Joseph's surprise without a word; her obedience, who went up to Bethlehem in the winter and bore our Lord in a stable; her meditative spirit, who pondered in her heart what she saw and heard about Him; her fortitude, whose heart the sword went through; her self-surrender, who gave Him up during His ministry and consented to His death.   Above all, let us imitate her purity, who, rather than relinquish her virginity, was willing to lose Him for a Son. O my dear children, young men and young women, what need have you of the intercession of the Virgin-mother, of her help, of her pattern, in this respect! What shall bring you forward in the narrow way, if you live in the world, but the thought and patronage of Mary? What shall seal your senses, what shall tranquillise your heart, when sights and sounds of danger are around you, but Mary? What shall give you patience and endurance, when you are wearied out with the length of the conflict with evil, with the unceasing necessity of precautions, with the irksomeness of observing them, with the tediousness of their repetition, with the strain upon your mind, with your forlorn and cheerless condition, but a loving communion with her! She will comfort you in your discouragements, solace you in your fatigues, raise you after your falls, reward you for your successes. She will show you her Son, your God and your all. When your spirit within you is excited, or relaxed, or depressed, when it loses its balance, when it is restless and wayward, when it is sick of what it has, and hankers after what it has not, when your eye is solicited with evil and your mortal frame trembles under the shadow of the tempter, what will bring you to yourselves, to peace and to health, but the cool breath of the Immaculate and the fragrance of the Rose of Sharon?

       For Thursday  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., on the wedding feast of Cana and the Last Supper    To His Mother He had said, "What have I to do with thee?" and now to His Apostles, "Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek Me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come, so now I say unto you." On this, "Simon Peter said unto Him, Lord, whither goest Thou?" and when our Lord answered him, that whither He went, he could not follow Him then, the zealous and impatient Apostle persisted, "Lord, why cannot I follow Thee now?" [John xiii. 33, 36.]  On the other hand, He promised that the separation should be but for a season. As to St. Mary, He had said, "Mine hour is not yet come;" so He said to St. Peter, in the passage just cited, "Whither I go thou canst not follow Me now, but thou shalt follow Me afterwards." And as at His first feast, He had seemed to turn from His Mother's prayer, while He granted it, because of the time, so to His Apostles He foretold, at His second feast, what the power of their prayers should be hereafter, by way of cheering them on His departure. "Ye now therefore have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. In that day ye shall ask Me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My Name, He will give it you." [John xvi. 22, 23.] And again, "Ye are My friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of My Father, I have made known unto you." [John xv. 14, 15.] In the gifts then promised to the Apostles after the Resurrection, we may learn the present influence and power of the Mother of God.  Such seems to be the connexion between the feast with which our Lord began, and that with which He ended His ministry. Nay, may we not add without violence, that in the former feast He had in mind and intended to foreshadow the latter? for what was that first miracle by which He manifested His glory in the former, but the strange and awful change of the element of water into wine? and what did He in the latter, but change the Paschal Supper and the typical lamb into the sacrament of His atoning sacrifice, and the creatures of bread and wine into the verities of His most precious Body and Blood? He began His ministry with a miracle; He ended it with a greater.   Sermons on Subjects of the Day

       On July 7, 1867  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., wrote to his friend Dean Church, and mentioned a gift that Church had made to him:   Your violin improves continually; I cannot desire a better one. I have got it at Rednal (ed. the Birmingham Oratory's retreat house), where I make a noise, without remonstrance from trees, grass, roses or cabbages.   One of his early biographers commented on his playing.   From the days when he played the violin as a young boy, his brother Frank playing the bass, down to the Littlemore period when he played in company with Frederick Bowles and Walker, string quartets and trios were his favourite recreation. Mr. Mozley in his 'Reminiscences of the Oxford Movement,' thus describes his playing of Beethoven with Blanco White in 1826: 'Most interesting was it to contrast Blanco White's excited and indeed agitated countenance with Newman's Sphinx-like immobility, as the latter drew long rich notes with a steady hand.' When the gift of a violin from Rogers and Church in 1864 made him renew acquaintance with his old love after a long interval, the manner of his playing was somewhat different. 'Sphinx-like immobility,' writes Mr. Edward Bellasis 'had made way for an ever varying expression upon his face as strains alternated between grave and gay. Producing his violin from an old green baize bag, bending forward, and holding it against his chest, instead of under the chin in the modern fashion, most particular about his instrument being in perfect tune, in execution awkward yet vigorous, painstaking rather than brilliant, he would often attend the Oratory School Sunday practices between two and four of an afternoon, Father Ryder and Father Norris sometimes coming to play also.

       On July 7, 1944  the Professor wrote a letter to his son Christopher, in which he talked about one of his favorite languages:   Finnish nearly ruined my Hon. Mods, and was the orginal germ for the Silmarillion.   Later in the same letter, he comments on the modern ignorance of classical literature:    Even if people have heard of the legends (which is getting rarer) they have no inkling of their portent. How could a maker of motorbikes name his prodcut Ixion Cycles ! Ixion, who was bound forever in hell on a perpertually revolving wheel !

       From  Parochial and Plain Sermons   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   O how great a good will it be, if, when this troublesome life is over, we in our turn also enter into that same rest,if the time shall one day come, when we shall enter into His tabernacle above, and hide ourselves under the shadow of His wings; if we shall be in the number of those blessed dead who die in the Lord, and rest from their labour. Here we are tossing upon the sea, and the wind is contrary. All through the day we are tried and tempted in various ways. We cannot think, speak, or act, but infirmity and sin are at hand. But in the unseen world, where Christ has entered, all is peace. There is the eternal Throne, and a rainbow round about it, like unto an emerald; and in the midst of the throne the Lamb that has been slain, and has redeemed many people by His blood: and round about the throne four and twenty seats for as many elders, all clothed in white raiment, and crowns of gold upon their heads. And four living beings full of eyes before and behind. And seven Angels standing before God, and doing His pleasure unto the ends of the earth. And the Seraphim above. And withal, a great multitude which no man can number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands. "These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." [Rev. vii. 14.] "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat." "There is no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither any more pain; for the former things are passed away." [Rev. xxi. 4.] Nor any more sin; nor any more guilt; no more remorse; no more punishment; no more penitence; no more trial; no infirmity to depress us; no affection to mislead us; no passion to transport us; no prejudice to blind us; no sloth, no pride, no envy, no strife; but the light of God's countenance, and a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the Throne. That is our  home ; here we are but on pilgrimage, and Christ is calling us home. He calls us to His many mansions, which He has prepared. And the Spirit and the Bride call us too, and all things will be ready for us by the time of our coming. "Seeing then that we have a great High Priest that has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession;" seeing we have "so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight;" "let us labour to enter into our rest;" "let us come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." [Heb. iv. 11, 14, 16; xii. 1.]

       For Saturday    Of these undefiled followers of the Lamb, the Blessed Mary is the chief. Strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might, she "staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief;" she believed when Zacharias doubted,with a faith like Abraham's she believed and was blessed for her belief, and had the performance of those things which were told her by the Lord. And when sorrow came upon her afterwards, it was but the blessed participation of her Son's sacred sorrows, not the sorrow of those who suffer for their sins.

       On July 16, 1835    &nbsp; Venerable John Henry Newman wrote to his close friend, Richard Hurrell Froude. &nbsp;   My chapel (Littlemore) was begun yesterday, and the first stone is to be solemnly laid next week. It is to be roofed in by the end of October. The two builders ran against each other 663 l . to 665 l ., the architect beforehand reckoning on 650 l .; so I hope I have got it at about the right sum. This takes in everything of fitting up except the bell. The Society [Oriel College] gives us 150 l .   &nbsp; Of course, he had no way of knowing that the chapel he had helped to build would be where he would preach his  urlLink last sermon as an Anglican ,eight years later.     O my brethren, O kind and affectionate hearts, O loving friends, should you know any one whose lot it has been, by writing or by word of mouth, in some degree to help you thus to act; if he has ever told you what you knew about yourselves, or what you did not know; has read to you your wants or feelings, and comforted you by the very reading; has made you feel that there was a higher life than this daily one, and a brighter world than that you see; or encouraged you, or sobered you, or opened a way to the inquiring, or soothed the perplexed; if what he has said or done has ever made you take interest in him, and feel well inclined towards him; remember such a one in time to come, though you hear him not, and pray for him, that in all things he may know God's will, and at all times he may be ready to fulfil it.  &nbsp; Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,&nbsp;  Sermons on Subjects of the Day

Happiness is to be found in the love of God.  God's grace providing entrance into heaven creates the highest form of human happiness.  Short of heaven, a person can achieve a more limited form of happiness through a life of virtue and friendship.  Morality is not determined by the arbitrary will of God.  Morality is derived from human nature and the activities that are objectively suited to it.  The difference between right and wrong can be appreciated through the use of reason and reflection.  Religious reflection may supplement the use of reason and reflection to determine right from wrong.  Societies must enact laws to ensure the correct application of moral reasoning.  Human nature is good because God made it good.     urlLink Quiz  courtesy of the blogger at  urlLink Ales Rarus .

       For Thursday     Do not think I say a strong thing, my brethren, when I tell you that I am speaking of some of those who now hear me. Not that I dare draw the line any where, or imagine that I can give any rule for knowing for certain, just who come to Him in heart and spirit, and who do not; but I am quite sure that many, who would shrink from giving up their interest in the Gospel, and who profess to cast their lot with Christ, and to trust in His death for their salvation, nevertheless, do not really seek Him that they may have life, in spite of their fair speeches. This I say I am too well enabled to know, because in fact so it is, that He has shown us  how  to come to Him, and I see that men do not come to Him in that way which He has pointed out. He has shown us, that to come to Him for life is a literal bodily action; not a mere figure, not a mere movement of the heart towards Him, but an action of the visible limbs; not a mere secret faith, but a coming to church, a passing on along the aisle to His holy table, a kneeling down there before Him, and a receiving of the gift of eternal life in the form of bread and wine. There can be no mistaking His own appointment. He said indeed, "He that cometh to Me shall never hunger;" but then He explained what this coming was, by adding, "He that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me." If then a man does not seek Him where He is, there is no profit in seeking Him where He is not. What is the good of sitting at home seeking Him, when His Presence is in the holy Eucharist? Such perverseness is like the sin of the Israelites who went to seek for the manna at a time when it was not given. May not He who gives the gift, prescribe the place and mode of giving it?   Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  Parochial and Plain Sermons   Note: This was preached and written when the Venerable was still Anglican, so he used "in the form of bread and wine" rather than words which would more clearly indicate Transubstantiation, a doctrine which he did not yet believe.

       On July 13, 1852  at the first Provincial Synod of Westminister, Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached his masterpiece of a sermon,  urlLink The Second Spring .   Here's just a taste.     One thing I am sure of, that the more the enemy rages against us, so much the more will the Saints in Heaven plead for us; the more fearful are our trials from the world, the more present to us will be our Mother Mary, and our good Patrons and Angel Guardians; the more malicious are the devices of men against us, the louder cry of supplication will ascend from the bosom of the whole Church to God for us. We shall not be left orphans; we shall have within us the strength of the Paraclete, promised to the Church and to every member of it. My Fathers, my Brothers in the priesthood, I speak from my heart when I declare my conviction, that there is no one among you here present but, if God so willed, would readily become a martyr for His sake. I do not say you would wish it; I do not say that the natural will would not pray that that chalice might pass away; I do not speak of what you can do by any strength of yours;but in the strength of God, in the grace of the Spirit, in the armour of justice, by the consolations and peace of the Church, by the blessing of the Apostles Peter and Paul, and in the name of Christ, you would do what nature cannot do. By the intercession of the Saints on high, by the penances and good works and the prayers of the people of God on earth, you would be forcibly borne up as upon the waves of the mighty deep, and carried on out of yourselves by the fulness of grace, whether nature wished it or no. I do not mean violently, or with unseemly struggle, but calmly, gracefully, sweetly, joyously, you would mount up and ride forth to the battle, as on the rush of Angels' wings, as your fathers did before you, and gained the prize. You, who day by day offer up the Immaculate Lamb of God, you who hold in your hands the Incarnate Word under the visible tokens which He has ordained, you who again and again drain the chalice of the Great Victim; who is to make you fear? what is to startle you? what to seduce you? who is to stop you, whether you are to suffer or to do, whether to lay the foundations of the Church in tears, or to put the crown upon the work in jubilation?

       The Feast of St. John Jones, O.F.M., Priest and Martyr  is today. There is information on him  urlLink here .    Can we religiously suppose that the blood of our martyrs, three centuries ago and since, shall never receive its recompense? Those priests, secular and regular, did they suffer for no end? or rather, for an end which is not yet accomplished? The long imprisonment, the fetid dungeon, the weary suspense, the tyrannous trial, the barbarous sentence, the savage execution, the rack, the gibbet, the knife, the cauldron, the numberless tortures of those holy victims, O my God, are they to have no reward? Are Thy martyrs to cry from under Thine altar for their loving vengeance on this guilty people, and to cry in vain? Shall they lose life, and not gain a better life for the children of those who persecuted them? Is this Thy way, O my God, righteous and true? Is it according to Thy promise, O King of saints, if I may dare talk to Thee of justice? Did not Thou Thyself pray for Thine enemies upon the cross, and convert them?    Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Sermons Preached on Various Occasions    It is also the feast of  urlLink St. Veronica , and of  urlLink St. John Gualbert,O.S.B. .  In addition, today is my birthday.

       Here are some notes...  from a sermon preached by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., on today's Gospel:     On Christ the Good Samaritan   1. INTROD.-Go through the parable briefly, applying it in a secondary sense to the sinner and Christ.  2. In the parable the traveller was robbed against his will, the sinner with his will. Satan cannot conquer us against ourselves. Evetemptation, etc.; it is a bargain.  3. Thus he gets from us justice, habitual grace, etc., nay, part of our mere nature, for he leaves wounds. Thus he may be said to suck the blood from us. A vampire bat sucking the blood out. All terrible stories of ghosts, etc., etc., are fulfilled in him who is the archetype of evil.  4. He has the best of the bargain, as is evident. What have we to show for it?there are improvident spendthrifts who anticipate their money, and get nothing for it. What have we to show if we have given ourselves to Satan?  5. (1) Those who commit fraudsill gains go. (2) Anger, swearing and blasphemywhat remains? (3) Sensuality is more rational, because men get something.  6. Yet in a few years where is it all? Let a man enjoy life, let him be rich, but he gets old, and then! Wisdom [v. 8]. 'What hath pride profited us?'  7. Thus Satan has the best of the bargain, and we lie like the traveller.  8. Nothing of this world can help uspriest or Levite: there we should lie for ever, etc.  9. Christ alone, by His sacraments.  10. Mind He is a Samaritanso Nazarethbecause the Catholic Church is hated. She is the good Samaritan to Protestants. Observe again the text, 'He who showed mercy to him.' Has the Catholic Church or Protestantism done this for us?

       Athanasius  has a fine  urlLink  explanation  of why dissent really happens.   This reminds me of a passage from an excellent book,  Turmoil and Truth: The Historical Roots of the Modern Crisis in the Catholic Church  , by Philip Trower.    Christians, heaven knows, should prize the state of grace above all things, but if they become unaccustomed of thinking of themselves as sinners and accustomed to valuing the feeling that they are nice and good, they will become tempted, if they do fall into serious sin, instead of being sorry for having offended God, to be angry at no longer being able to think well of themselves.  This attitude of mind has, I think, not a little to do with today's drive by lay people to have the Church alter its moral teaching. It would also explain the anxiety of so many European and American bishops to accomodate them. The Church must allow contraception and divorce, one hears it argued, because "so many of our best Catholics want them." As far at one can see, the only reason why the prelates in question regard these particular Catholics as the best is that they are well-off, well-educated, and have the right table manners.  This is very much a middle-class phenomenon. When the poor decide to break a law of God, they don't normally expect the Church to alter her teaching so that they can continue to think well of themselves. They are not astonished at finding themselves sinners. In this they have more in common with the rich and grand who, whatever their other failings, are not usually interested in a reputation for moral rectitude either.

       On July 24, 1864  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:     The Pharisee and the Publican  1. INTROD.'God be merciful to me a sinner.'  2. In these words is contained the essence of true religion.  3.  Why?  Because they refer to conscience as leading the mind  to God .  4. All men have a conscience of right and wrong, Rom. ii. 14.15. the conscience accusing , etc. But it does not lead them, when they transgress it, to  God . They are angry with themselves. They know they are wrong, and are distressed, but it does not lead them to religion; at the utmost it leads them to understand a sin against their neighboursas cruelty, etc. But when it leads the soul to think of God, then that soul may be very sinful, but at least it has something of  true religion  in it.  5. 2 Cor. vii. 10-11 . And so 'to Thee then only have I sinned, and done evil before Thee.' Ps. 1.   6. Hence in the text the reason why the publican was  more justified , because he understood that his offenses were against God.  7. But see what comes from this. Directly a man realises that what he does wrong is against God, then he feels how much more extensive it is, viz. of the thoughts.  8. And how much more intensive, viz. as against the Highest. He calls it  sin .  9. Then he grows in his notions. As blows don't pain at first, so sin may pain hereafter.  10. Thus he sees it is an offence against the moral nature of God.  11. Hence all diseases are but types of sin.  12. Hence idea of guilt.  13. Hence need of a cleansing.

       From the homily  Fr. David was the celebrant at the 10:00 am Mass. The homily focused on the great mercy inherent in God's gift of time, inasmuch as it gives us the chance to repent. What I remember best is the final sentence. "If we saw ourselves as we truly are, we would realize just how great a mercy that is. "

       On July 23, 1854  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:     Nature and Grace   1. INTROD.Text: 'Jesus loved him.'  2. Explain the circumstances. And then we come to this anomalythat God loves  for something in them  those who will not obey His call.  3. Now this is a difficulty surely which we feel ourselves. People are (1) amiable, (2) conscientious, (3) benevolent; they do many good actions, but are not Catholics; or not in God's grace.  4. Explanation. Nature not simply evil. We do not say that Nature cannot do good actions without God's grace. Far from it. Instances of great heathens.  5. What we say is that no one can get to  heaven  without God's grace.   6. Contrast of two states as on two levels: (1) moral virtues with 'their reward,' industry, etc., has a reward in  this  life.  7. (2) Spiritual state of grace. It has all these virtues and a  good  deal more, and especially faith.  8. This is why faith is so necessary. Explain what faith is, as a door. It is a sight, [power of vision]. It is looking up to God. When we  pray , we have faith, etc., etc.  9. Now what an awful thought this is when you look at the worldif something  more than  Nature is necessary for salvation.  10. People say, 'If I do my duty''He was such a good father'; 'He was upright,' etc., etc. All this is good, but by itself will not bring a man to heaven.  11. When you think what heaven is, is it wonderful? Think of our sins. Is it wonderful God does not give forgiveness to Nature?  12. Is it wonderful that grace alone can get repentance?  13. Let us turn this [over] in our hearts.

       The Feast of St. Mary Magdalen, Penitent  is today. There is information on her  urlLink here .     Was it a sudden inspiration, or a mature resolve? was it an act of the moment, or the result of a long conflict?but behold, that poor, many-coloured child of guilt approaches to crown with her sweet ointment the head of Him to whom the feast was given; and see, she has stayed her hand. She has looked, and she discerns the Immaculate, the Virgin's Son, "the brightness of the Eternal Light, and the spotless mirror of God's majesty". She looks, and she recognises the Ancient of Days, the Lord of life and death, her Judge; and again she looks, and she sees in His face and in His mien a beauty, and a sweetness, awful, serene, majestic, more than that of the sons of men, which paled all the splendour of that festive room. Again she looks, timidly yet eagerly, and she discerns in His eye, and in His smile, the loving-kindness, the tenderness, the compassion, the mercy of the Saviour of man. She looks at herself, and oh! how vile, how hideous is she, who but now was so vain of her attractions!how withered is that comeliness, of which the praises ran through the mouths of her admirers!how loathsome has become the breath, which hitherto she thought so fragrant, savouring only of those seven bad spirits which dwell within her! And there she would have stayed, there she would have sunk on the earth, wrapped in her confusion and in her despair, had she not cast one glance again on that all-loving, all-forgiving Countenance. He is looking at her: it is the Shepherd looking at the lost sheep, and the lost sheep surrenders herself to Him. He speaks not, but He eyes her; and she draws nearer to Him. Rejoice, ye Angels, she draws near, seeing nothing but Him, and caring neither for the scorn of the proud, nor the jests of the profligate. She draws near, not knowing whether she shall be saved or not, not knowing whether she shall be received, or what will become of her; this only knowing that He is the Fount of holiness and truth, as of mercy, and to whom should she go, but to Him who hath the words of eternal life? "Destruction is thine own, O Israel; in Me only is thy help. Return unto Me, and I will not turn away My face from thee: for I am holy, and will not be angry for ever." "Behold we come unto thee; for Thou art the Lord our God. Truly the hills are false, and the multitude of the mountains: Truly the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel." Wonderful meeting between what was most base and what is most pure! Those wanton hands, those polluted lips, have touched, have kissed the feet of the Eternal, and He shrank not from the homage. And as she hung over them, and as she moistened them from her full eyes, how did her love for One so great, yet so gentle, wax vehement within her, lighting up a flame which never was to die from that moment even for ever! and what excess did it reach, when He recorded before all men her forgiveness, and the cause of it! "Many sins are forgiven her, for she loved much; but to whom less is forgiven, the same loveth less. And He said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven thee; thy faith hath made thee safe, go in peace."   Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Discourses to Mixed Congregations     It is also the feast of  urlLink St. John Lloyd, Priest and Martyr .

       On July 21, 1878  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached the first part of what was apparently a two-part sermon. (He preached the second part the next Sunday.) The following notes survive:    On the New Creation  I  1. We find from St. Paul that  its  life [i.e. the life of the New Creation] is gratitude for our Lord's sufferings for us, 2 Cor. v.; Gal. ii., sin.  2. Gratitude implies (and requires) (1) sense of sin; (2) faith.  3. Leads to (3) hope; (4) hope implies fear.  4. And gratitude is a kind of love.  II  But love is charity, such as is necessary to fulfil the command for 'eternal life,' 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with,' etc.,  Involves  1. Gratitude.  2. Likeness to God. Like loves like,  i.e.  love of appreciation.  3. The love of friendship'Abraham the  friend '; John xv., 'friends'which involves a mutual consciousness of loveJohn xxi., 'Lord, thou knowest,' etc.  4. Companionship'Walk before me'; 'Walk with me'journey to Emmaus.  5.  Dilectio preference.

       From  Faith and Prejudice and Other Unpublished Sermons     by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    Never does God give faith, but He tries it, and none without faith can enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore all ye who come to serve God, all ye who wish to save your souls, begin with making up your minds that you cannot do so, without a generous faith, a generous self-surrender; without putting yourselves into God's hands, making no bargain with Him, not stipulating conditions, but saying "O Lord here I amI will be whatever Thou wilt ask meI will go whithersoever Thou sendest meI will bear whatever Thou puttest upon me. Not in my own might or my own strength. My strength is very weaknessif I trust in myself more or less, I shall failbut I trust in TheeI trust and I know that Thou wilt aid me to do, what Thou callest on me to doI trust and I know that Thou wilt never leave me nor forsake me. Never wilt Thou bring me into any trial, which Thou wilt not bring me through. Never will there be a failing on Thy part, never will there be a lack of grace. I shall have all and abound. I shall be tried: my reason will be tried, for I shall have to believe; my affections will be tried, for I shall have to obey Thee instead of pleasing myself; my flesh will be tried, for I shall have to bring it into subjection. But Thou art more to me than all other things put together. Thou canst make up to me all Thou takest from me and Thou wilt, for Thou wilt give to me Thyself. Thou wilt guide me."

       Interesting article...      urlLink The Family: Discovering the Obvious   Two samples....    There are in fact a variety of nontraditional households. I will limit my comments to that subset now posing the most immediate public challenge: the household self-consciously created in contradistinction to the natural family; the household in which the natural family can only be imitated rather than created; the household now demanding not only recognition of some sort from society at large, but also the guarantee of moral equivalence. I suggest that we call this the antitraditional household, both to distinguish it from what has gone before and to capture something of its defiant essence. And since such households can further be divided into two variants, heterosexual and homosexual, I propose that we proceed by examining them in turn.  What this distinction immediately makes clear is something interesting and pretty much unnoticed in todays furor over gay marriage: that intellectually speaking, at least, the  heterosexual  variation of the antitraditional household has been steadily losing ground for years now...       Sooner or later, someone is going to ask why, if being gay is cause for celebration, gay boys and men continue to kill themselves at significantly higher rates than do heterosexuals. Sooner or later, someone is going to wonder why, despite societys open arms, virtually every study of gay mental health shows higher rates of depression, alcoholism, sexual addiction, sexually transmitted diseases, and the rest.   This is the evidence ignored by, for example, judges who place children in gay-headed households. It is also the evidence ignored by everyone who argues that homosexuality has nothing to do with sex scandals involving young boys. It is also the evidence that will not go away. The empirical reality of much of gay life contradicts the rhetoric of virtual normality; and eventually, it seems safe to predict, the twain shall meet....

       From  Parochial and Plain Sermons    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    Surely, no one, who is candid, can doubt, that, were Mary now living, did she choose on principle that state of life in which Christ found her, were she content to remain at Jesus' feet hearing His word and disengaged from this troublesome world, she would be blamed and pitied. Careless men would gaze strangely, and wise men compassionately, on such an one, as wasting her life, and choosing a melancholy, cheerless portion. Long ago was this the case. Even in holy Martha, zealous as she was and true-hearted, even in her instance we are reminded of the impatience and disdain with which those who are far different from her, the children of this world, regard such as dedicate themselves to God. Long ago, even in her, we seem to witness, as in type, the rash, unchristian way in which this age disparages devotional services. Do we never hear it said, that the daily Service of the Church is unnecessary? Is it never hinted that it is scarcely worth while to keep it up unless we get numbers to attend it, as if one single soul, if but one, were not precious enough for Christ's love and His Church's rearing? Is it never objected, that a partially-filled Church is a discouraging sight, as if, after all, our Lord Jesus had chosen the many and not the few to be His true disciples? Is it never maintained, that a Christian minister is off his post unless he is for ever labouring for the heartless many, instead of ministering to the more religious few? Alas! there must be something wrong among us; when our defenders recommend the Church on the mere plea of its activity, its popularity, and its visible usefulness, and would scarcely scruple to give us up, had we  not  the many on our side! If our ground of boasting be, that rich men, and mighty men, and many men love us, it never can be a religious boast, and may be our condemnation. Christ made His feast for "the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind." It is the widow and the fatherless, the infirm, the helpless, the devoted, bound together in prayer, who are the strength of the Church. It is their prayers, be they many or few, the prayers of Mary and such as Mary, who are the safety, under Christ, of those who with Paul and Barnabas fight the Lord's battles. "It is but lost labour to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows," if prayers are discontinued. It is mere infatuation, if we think to resist the enemies who at this moment are at our doors, if our Churches remain shut, and we give up to prayer but a few minutes in the day.

       Just because     All the works of God are founded on unity, for they are founded on Himself, who is the most awfully simple and transcendent of possible unities. He is emphatically One; and whereas He is also multiform in His attributes and His acts, as they present themselves to our minds, it follows that order and harmony must be of His very essence. To be many and distinct in His attributes, yet, after all, to be but one,to be sanctity, justice, truth, love, power, wisdom, to be at once each of these as fully as if He were nothing but it, as if the rest were not,this implies in the Divine Nature an infinitely sovereign and utterly incomprehensible order, which is an attribute as wonderful as any, and the result of all the others. He is an infinite law, as well as an infinite power, wisdom, and love. Moreover, the very idea of order implies the idea of the subordinate. If order exists in the Divine Attributes, they must have relations one to another, and though each is perfect in itself, it must act so as not to impair the perfection of the rest, and must seem to yield to the rest on particular occasions. Thus God's power, indeed, is infinite, but it is still subordinate to His wisdom and His justice; His justice, again, is infinite, but it, too, is subordinate to His love; and His love, in turn, is infinite, but it is subordinate to His incommunicable sanctity. There is an understanding between attribute and attribute, so that one does not interfere with the other, for each is supreme in its own sphere; and thus an infinitude of infinities, acting each in its own order, are combined together in the infinitely simple unity of God.  Such is the unity, and consequent harmony and beauty of the Divine Nature, even when viewed in the lights which are supplied to us by the traditions of the human race and the investigations of the human intellect. But, wonderful as is that order and harmony, considered only in the way of nature, much more wonderful is it in the mysteries of Revelation. There we are introduced to the ineffable, the adorable, the most gracious dogma of a Trinity in Unity, which is what I may call the triumph of Unity over difficulties, which, to our limited faculties, seem like impossibilities and contradictions. How strong,how severe, how infinitely indivisible, must be that Unity of God, which is not compromised by the truth of His being Three! How surpassing is that Unity of substance which remains untroubled and secure, though it is occupied and possessed wholly and unreservedly, not only by the Father, but also by the Son; not only by Father and Son, but by the Holy Ghost also! And, moreover, as there is a subordination, as I have said, of attribute to attribute, without any detriment to the infinitude of each of them individually, and this is the glory of the God of Nature; so also does an order, and, as I may say, a subordination exist between Person and Person, and this is the incommunicable glory of the God of Grace.

       On July 29, 1848  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:     Christ Weeping over Jerusalem   1. INTROD. Wonderful union of mercy and severity in God, as in our Saviour weeping over Jerusalem. Who can have hard thoughts of Him? Yet who can presume?  2. Take the case of the Jews. St. Paul says 'these things happened in figure': they are a figure of God's dealings with every soul. Consider the frequent judgments mentioned in the epistlehow often He had to punish before He gave them up. At last wrath came without remedyHe wept while He denouncedit was over and there was no hope. He dried His tearsHe rose upHe executed wrathHe rejected them and burned up their city.  3. And so in every age. Consider what a wonderful patiencethe same thing acted over and over againhow  weary  the angels must get of the  history  of the worldevery generation beginning with sinners, and then some turning to repentancelooking at individual souls, seeing them plunge into sin fearlesslyyet they are afterwards to repentthey must feel indignation that God should be trifled with. The very same poor souls who now sin will repent as the generation before them: they even take their fill of sin before they turn to God.  4. Then they see repentanceall so promising, such a good start; yet God sees that those very persons, who are beginning so well, are again to fall from Himto profane and ungratefully treat all His gifts.  5. But so the world goes on. Numbers never coming back to God [at] all, numbers coming back then falling again, numbers repenting only in the end of life, numbers sinning against light and warning, again and again, till they are cast off without remedy. Observe how stern the words,  'for now they are hidden from thine eyes.'   6. Yet  how beautiful  the temple looked. Describegoodly stoneshow unlikely that it should be destroyed, yet it was doomed.  7. Blessed they who do not sin; next blessed they who consider God's wrath and mercy not one of them only,  lest they despair or presume.

       On July 28, 1824  a recently ordained Anglican deacon by the name of John Henry Newman wrote to his mother. In his letter, he mentions his attempts to get to know his parishoners  :   About ten days ago I began my  visitation  of the whole parish, going from house to house, asking the names, numbers, trades, where they went to church, &c. I have got through, as yet, about a third (and the most respectable third) of the population. In general they have been very civil; often expressed gratification that a clergyman should visit them; hoped to see me again, &c. &c. If in the habit of attending the dissenting meeting, they generally excused themselves on the plea of the rector being old, and they could not hear him or the church too small, &c.; but expressed no unwillingness to come back. I rather dread the two-thirds of the parish which are to come; but trust (and do not doubt) I shall be carried through it well, and as I could wish. It will be a great thing done; I shall know my parishioners, and be known by them. I have taken care always to speak kindly of Mr. Hinton, the dissenting minister, expressed a wish to know him, &c.; said I thought he had done goodwhich he hadin the place.  Last Sunday I had it given out in church that there would be an afternoon sermon during the summer. From what I hear, on talking to various people about it, I doubt not, with God's blessing, it will answer very well. I am glad to say the church is so full in the morning that people go away; but that is not saying much. As you recollect, it only holds two hundred; however, there often used not (I am told) to be more than fifty at church. I wish very much to establish a Sunday School. The only Sunday I have been absent from St. Clement's was last Sunday, when I was at Warton. I had three services and sermons there in the day; but did not feel fatigue.  The sermons I send you were not intended for compositions: you will find them full of inaccuracies. I am aware they contain truths which are unpalatable to the generality of mankind; but the doctrine of Christ crucified is the only spring of real virtue and piety, and the only foundation of peace and comfort. I know I must do good. I may and shall meet with disappointments, much to distress me, much (I hope) to humble me; but as God is true, He will go with the doctrine:  magna est veritas et prævalebit.     He does not mention it here, but in the course of his visitations, he eagerly knocked on the door of a man whom the neighbors described as never having set foot in the parish church- and it turned out that the man was a Jesuit priest who ministered to the few Catholics in the area of Oxford. Twenty-one years later, that priest returned the favor- only now Newman was a recent convert and the priest got to tell him "Welcome home!"

       On July 27, 1856  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:    On the Healing of the Deaf and Dumb Man   1. INTROD.We read these words in today's gospel, 'They bring unto Him,' etc.   2. The man is cured, and two things go to his cureChrist's word and act, and His disciples bring him to Him. Christ does not heal without His disciples, and they cannot heal except as bringing to Him.  3. So it is nowthe great ordained systemChrist the Author of Grace, and His friends whom He brings round Him, and makes His family, the step towards obtaining grace  by prayer .  4. Christ can do all things. He created, He redeemed without any one else; but He saved [saves?] through the co-operation of othersby the saints above and the Church below.  5. Christ can do all thingsHe  gives grace  too, and it is only by His ordained systemmerit a promisea contract, etc., etc.  6. Christ can do all things, and He does not confine Himself to [co-operation of] others, so far as this, that all over the earth, external to His Church, He hears those who call on Him. He has many ways. Every one has a guardian angel. Case of Hagar.  7.  But  He does this to bring them on into His Church, that they too may become His friends.  8. And it must be recollected that the Holy Church Universal is praying everywhere [for them]. Mass [continually offered].  9. Abraham and Moses. God reveals that His friends  may  pray, 'I say not that I will ask the Father,' etc.   Therefore it is that we call our Lady our advocate, and the saints intercessors; for our Lord has made over this lower office to them, and stands in the higher, of the Giver of grace.  10. Thus the salvation of the world is in our hands, [e.g. of]  11. EnglandBirmingham.  12. Therefore let us  pray .

       Just because     An argument has been often put forward by unbelievers, I think by Paine, to this effect, that "a revelation, which is to be received as true, ought to be written on the sun." This appeals to the common-sense of the many with great force, and implies the assumption of a principle which Butler, indeed, would not grant, and would consider unphilosophical, and yet I think something may be said in its favour. Whether abstractedly defensible or not, Catholic populations would not be averse,  mutatis mutandis , to admitting it. Till these last centuries, the Visible Church was, at least to her children, the light of the world, as conspicuous as the sun in the heavens; and the Creed was written on her forehead, and proclaimed through her voice, by a teaching as precise as it was emphatical; in accordance with the text, "Who is she that looketh forth at the dawn, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as an army set in array?" It was not, strictly speaking, a miracle, doubtless; but in its effect, nay, in its circumstances, it was little less. Of course I would not allow that the Church fails in this manifestation of the truth now, any more than in former times, though the clouds have come over the sun; for what she has lost in her appeal to the imagination, she has gained in philosophical cogency, by the evidence of her persistent vitality. So far is clear, that if Paine's aphorism has a  primâ facie   force against Christianity, it owes this advantage to the miserable deeds of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

       The Old Oligarch  reads the riot act on  urlLink the lack of modesty in female apparel, particularly swimwear . While I sympathize to a certain extent, and do recognize that members of my sex are currently encouraged to be the worst offenders in this area, I couldn't help wondering- where is the male-focused part of  urlLink wholesomewear.com  ? Alternatively, where is an equivalent site for boys and men ? What men wear to the beach these days is often not particulary edifying. Yes, I am aware that men are visually stimulated more easily than women. However, it comes across as unfair when women are excoriated for wearing bikinis when men are not equally condemned for wearing even less.

       On July 25, 1968  one of the  urlLink most prophetic documents of the 20th century  was issued.   Consider just this one little section, dealing with what happens when the use of contraceptives becomes widespread:    Responsible men can become more deeply convinced of the truth of the doctrine laid down by the Church on this issue if they reflect on the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control. Let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards. Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beingsand especially the young, who are so exposed to temptationneed incentives to keep the moral law, and it is an evil thing to make it easy for them to break that law. Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.  Finally, careful consideration should be given to the danger of this power passing into the hands of those public authorities who care little for the precepts of the moral law. Who will blame a government which in its attempt to resolve the problems affecting an entire country resorts to the same measures as are regarded as lawful by married people in the solution of a particular family difficulty? Who will prevent public authorities from favoring those contraceptive methods which they consider more effective? Should they regard this as necessary, they may even impose their use on everyone.     Lowering of moral standards, lots of adultery, massive amounts of fornication, especially among the young....  check.   Men losing respect for women and treating them as sex toys...  check.   Governments in many countries pushing contraceptives and sterilizations on their people...  check.   Coincidence? I think not....

       If it were not Sunday...  today would be the feast of  urlLink St. James the Greater, Apostle and Martyr .     James and John   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  Two brothers freely cast their lot      With David's royal Son;  The cost of conquest counting not,      They deem the battle won.   Brothers in heart, they hope to gain      An undivided joy;   That man may one with man remain,      As boy was one with boy.   Christ heard; and will'd that James should fall,      First prey of Satan's rage;  John linger out his fellows all,      And die in bloodless age.

       On August 7, 1864  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:     The One Sacrifice   1. Christ a sacrifice. We keep the feast at Easter: 'Christ our Pasch,' etc.  2. What is meant by sacrifice?offering, killing, eating. Objects(1) worship, (2) thanksgiving, (3) propitiation, (4) impetration.  3. Heathen sacrifices, 1 Cor. x. 20, 'The things which the heathen sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God.'  Taurobolium , etc.; human sacrifices, etc.  4. Jewish sacrifices, Lev. ix., x., xvi.   5. Fulfilled in Christ. Two thingsdeath and intercession. Therefore the Aaronic priesthood and bloody sacrifice fulfilled in one act and time by our Lord in the flesh. Scripture speaks of our Lord as not only fulfilling a bloody sacrifice (which is once for all), but besides this of a sacrifice according to Melchisedech, that is, bread and wine.  6. Superiorityonce for all; all sin.  7. His mercy in continuing the sacrifice, that it might not be a mere matter of history.  8. This is the Mass; which is His sacrifice reiterated, represented, applied, as He continues it in heaven. Mal. i. 11 .  9. Order of Melchisedech.  10. One priest, one victim, one sacrificing, everywhere.  11. From the firstvarious liturgiespoints in common. Detail of rites as in the bloody [sacrifice on Mount Calvary]as our Lord taken before Pilate, etc., etc.  12. Arguments for apostolicity of the Mass.

       Interesting article..  by  urlLink Peter Kreeft . Here is a paragraph.    The change is this: The old contemplative attitude of objectivity, wonder, and respect is replaced by a new activist attitude of conquest, use, and subjective satisfaction  in relation to women just as in relation to truth. The old poets used to sing of women as ends, as objects of admiration, awe, contemplation, and even worship; the new ones sing of them as means rather than ends, as objects of use (and, if we are to call rappers poets, of domination, rape, murder, and mutilation). We have transformed women from Beatrice to Barbie, from the Madonna to Madonna (what a difference a "the" makes!), from images of God to occasions for self-gratification. This is inevitable, for the subjective experience of the sexual "high" is our culture's substitute for the mystical experience we were designed for. Aquinas says, "No man can live without joy. That is why, deprived of spiritual joys, he must go over to carnal pleasures."

       The Solemnity of the Transfiguration of the Lord  is today. There is information on it  urlLink here .    The day will come at length, when our Lord and Saviour will unveil that Sacred Countenance to the whole world, which no sinner ever yet could see and live. Then will the world be forced to look upon Him, whom they pierced with their unrepented wickednesses; "all faces will gather blackness." [Joel ii. 6.] Then they will discern, what they do not now believe, the utter deformity of sin; while the Saints of the Lord, who seemed on earth to bear but the countenance of common men, will wake up one by one after His likeness, and be fearful to look upon. And then will be fulfilled the promise pledged to the Church on the Mount of Transfiguration.   Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.,  Parochial and Plain Sermons

       On August 5, 1877  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:     The End of Man  1. Why are we placed here on earth? This is a question which comes often to children, and is the beginning of their responsibility.  2. Too often the question ceases to be asked by the young soul; but it drowns the thought in the levity of the small world of children around it.  3. But I repeat it, my brethren, think of it now Why  are you here in this world? Were you put here merely to eat, drink, sleep, etc., for a certain [number] of years, to marry, to grow old, to die? Were you put here merely to get on in life, to make a fortune and a name, to gain power, influence, to be in a position to gratify ambition, etc.? You know you have a higher end than this.  4. Now consider what the real reason is. You were put here to prepare yourself for a higher and eternal state; and for this all the riches, power, nameall the cleverness, sharpness and knowledge you may have or acquire, nay, I will say, all the industry, all the affectionateness, all the good-heartedness you have by nature (though these qualities are entirely good)will not avail at all.   5. You are come to make the raw material of your souls into (as I may say) a vessel of honour for the Lord's house above.  6. Consider the instance of various trades on earth, and you will understandbread, pottery, moulding, and the fine artsa building, a statue.  7. So there is the raw material of your soulit is called in Scripture the flesh; it is human nature in the rude condition to which Adam's sin has reduced it. Take the instance of the brute animalsyou will in a measure understand what human nature isthe passions, etc.  8. On bringing the soul into shapethe small trials of every day.  9. How different good old men are from what they were when young. So, on the other hand, you can't help moulding yourself. Woe to you if you mould the wrong way.

       From  An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    The common sense of mankind does but support a conclusion thus forced upon us by analogical considerations. It feels that the very idea of revelation implies a present informant and guide, and that an infallible one; not a mere abstract declaration of Truths unknown before to man, or a record of history, or the result of an antiquarian research, but a message and a lesson speaking to this man and that. This is shown by the popular notion which has prevailed among us since the Reformation, that the Bible itself is such a guide; and which succeeded in overthrowing the supremacy of Church and Pope, for the very reason that it was a rival authority, not resisting merely, but supplanting it. In proportion, then, as we find, in matter of fact, that the inspired volume is not adapted or intended to subserve that purpose, are we forced to revert to that living and present Guide, who, at the era of our rejection of her, had been so long recognized as the dispenser of Scripture, according to times and circumstances, and the arbiter of all true doctrine and holy practice to her children. We feel a need, and she alone of all things under heaven supplies it. We are told that God has spoken. Where? In a book? We have tried it and it disappoints; it disappoints us, that most holy and blessed gift, not from fault of its own, but because it is used for a purpose for which it was not given. The Ethiopian's reply, when St. Philip asked him if he understood what he was reading, is the voice of nature: "How can I, unless some man shall guide me?" The Church undertakes that office; she does what none else can do, and this is the secret of her power.

St. John  Vianney, as many people know, wasn't exactly a brilliant student. One of his teachers, exasperated with his inability, snapped, "Vianney, you are  a complete ass !  " The target of this remark replied, "Yes, but with God's help, Samson slew a thousand men with the jawbone of an ass. Just imagine what He could do with a  complete  ass ! "

Such was the learned Pharisee, who came to Jesus by night, well satisfied with his station, jealous of his reputation, confident in his reason; but the time at length came, when, even though disciples fled, he remained to anoint the abandoned corpse of Him, whom when living he had been ashamed to own. You see it was the grace of God that triumphed in Magdalen, in Matthew, and in Nicodemus; heavenly grace came down upon corrupt nature; it subdued impurity in the youthful woman, covetousness in the publican, fear of man in the Pharisee.

Why has God given us a 'Word'? Because we are so ignorant.  4. Two Testaments. First with one nation (Old), then with people of  all  nations (New).  5. The Bible, the Book.  6. By the by, why are Catholics said to  burn  the Bible? They never do, or have (unless they committed an act of sin); but what they  burned  was not the Bible but a Protestant translation. (Also without comment.)  7. The Church  comments  and  explains . Now as to the Old Testament, or the Word of God to the Jews,  8. Law and prophets,  9. Till our Lord came.

       The June/July  First Things   is  urlLink online . I'm particularly fond of this  urlLink article  by R.R. Reno. However, I simply must quote this short piece by Fr. Neuhaus.     Its been a while since Ive had occasion to remark on Peter Singer of Princeton University, the ageing bad boy of moral philosophy. But now Gerald Nora, a second-year medical student, sends me the dust jacket of the 1996 edition of Singers  Rethinking Life and Death . Mr. Nora is right in suspecting that the blurbs praising the book might have been chosen by Professor Singers enemies. For instance, there is this from the  Washington Post : Far from pointing a way out of todays moral dilemmas, Singers book is a road map for driving down the darkest of moral blind alleys. . . . Read it to remind yourself of the enormities of which putatively civilized beings are capable. Precisely. If you want a roadmap for driving down blind alleys, this is it. Then there is this from the publisher: A profound and provocative work in the tradition of Aldous Huxleys  Brave New World . Precisely again. Even more precisely, it is in the tradition of thinking that Huxley so powerfully warned us against.    (BTW, I'll admit that the topic alone isn't why I quoted this in full. The other reason is that I happen to know Jerry Nora, and felt I should blog this mention of him. )

        From  Parochial and Plain Sermons    by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.    The doctrine of the Cross does but teach, though infinitely more forcibly, still after all it does but teach the very same lesson which this world teaches to those who live long in it, who have much experience in it, who know it. The world is sweet to the lips, but bitter to the taste. It pleases at first, but not at last. It looks gay on the outside, but evil and misery lie concealed within. When a man has passed a certain number of years in it, he cries out with the Preacher, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." Nay, if he has not religion for his guide, he will be forced to go further, and say, "All is vanity and vexation of spirit;" all is disappointment; all is sorrow; all is pain. The sore judgments of God upon sin are concealed within it, and force a man to grieve whether he will or no. Therefore the doctrine of the Cross of Christ does but anticipate for us our experience of the world. It is true, it bids us grieve for our sins in the midst of all that smiles and glitters around us; but if we will not heed it, we shall at length be forced to grieve for them from undergoing their fearful punishment. If we will not acknowledge that this world has been made miserable by sin, from the sight of Him on whom our sins were laid, we shall experience it to be miserable by the recoil of those sins upon ourselves.  It may be granted, then, that the doctrine of the Cross is not on the surface of the world. The surface of things is bright only, and the Cross is sorrowful; it is a hidden doctrine; it lies under a veil; it at first sight startles us, and we are tempted to revolt from it. Like St. Peter, we cry out, "Be it far from Thee, Lord; this shall not be unto Thee." [Matt. xvi. 22.] And yet it is a true doctrine; for truth is not on the surface of things, but in the depths.

       From  Essays Critical and Historical   by Venerable John Henry Newman,C.O.    The Rationalist makes himself his own centre, not his Maker; he does not go to God, but he implies that God must come to him. And this, it is to be feared, is the spirit in which multitudes of us act at the present day. Instead of looking out of ourselves, and trying to catch glimpses of God's workings, from any quarter,throwing ourselves forward upon Him and waiting on Him, we sit at home bringing everything to ourselves, enthroning ourselves in our own views, and refusing to believe anything that does not force itself upon us as true. Our private judgment is made everything to us,is contemplated, recognized, and consulted as the arbiter of all questions, and as independent of everything external to us. Nothing is considered to have an existence except so far forth as our minds discern it. The notion of half views and partial knowledge, of guesses, surmises, hopes and fears, of truths faintly apprehended and not understood, of isolated facts in the great scheme of Providence, in a word, the idea of Mystery, is discarded.

       On August 11, 1890  Venerable John Henry Cardinal Newman, C.O., went to his eternal reward. I posted a long entry on this  urlLink last year .  Once again, here is the prayer for his canonization:    Eternal Father, You led JOHN HENRY NEWMAN to follow the kindly light of Truth, and he obediently responded to your heavenly calls at any cost. As writer, preacher, counsellor and educator, as pastor, Oratorian, and servant of the poor he laboured to build up Your Kingdom.  Grant that through your Vicar on Earth we may hear the words, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter into the company of the canonized saints."  May You manifest Your servant's power of intercession by even extraordinary answers to the prayers of the faithful throughout the world. We pray particularly for our intentions in his name and in the Name of Jesus Christ Your Son our Lord.  Amen.  Please report any favours received to: The Postulator, The Oratory, Hagley Road, Birmingham B16 8UE, England    A thank-you to  urlLink Zadok ,  urlLink Lane Core , and anyone else who blogged about this anniversary.    In other Oratorian news, Juan Ortiz of the Pharr Oratory will be ordained to the diaconate tonight. Prayers for him and his brothers in St. Philip down there in southern Texas would be most welcome. ( I happen to know him, as he attends St. Vincent Seminary in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and stays at the Pittsburgh Oratory during the school year. )

       On August 10, 1851  Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O., preached a sermon, of which the following notes survive:    On the Death of the Sinner   1. INTROD.The gospelour Lord weeping over Jerusalem. Particulars of it. The Jews so little aware. They thought a great conqueror was coming to them. Their great infatuation. They had a vast future (they thought) before them. The Temple rebuilt. Our Lord saw through it all.  2. Application to the soul of the individual. Type of sinner in death. Our Lord looking and prophesying ill(particulars). 'Cast a trench,' 'hedge them in.'  3. 'Hedge them in.' Yes, Satan will take possession of him; keep God out; keep him all to himself. What a portentous thought!  4. Christ foresees it, weeps over the man, but He leaves him.  5. But does He not give grace? Yes, but it is ineffectual.  6. Why does He not give more? What is that to the purpose? He does not.  7. We cannot change things by asking questions. Why does He punish him? Can you change it by disputing? Your wisdom is to take things as they are, and submit and improve them. Is not this the way you do with this world? You do not quarrel with the wind, the flame, etc., but use them. Our Lord with Judas. His denunciations of eternal woe. His own sufferings [are as if He said], 'I say not why, but I suffer.'  8. Well, then, the fact is this. The sinner generally is thus 'walled in.'  Vide  St. Alfonso on this day.  9. Saul. Antiochus.  10. Encircledwild beasts. Sins as faithful friends who encircle you in their arms.  11. The priest's prayers in vain.   12. The sacraments in vain.  13. Our Lady not. Ave Maria! St. Andrew Avellino!  14. Let us ask her to intercede for us.

       The Pertinacious Papist  notes that even in the ancient world, revulsion at sexual perversion was  urlLink not limited to Jews and Christians . (NOTE:The post contains frank descriptions of unsavory practices.)   Another, and even more striking, example of an ancient pagan seeing what many who claim to be Christian do not, is that of the lascivious poet Ovid  urlLink denouncing  abortion .

       On August 9, 1874   Venerable John Henry Newman preached the second part of a two-part sermon. The following notes survive:     RevelationWord of God [II]   1. INTROD.Recapitulation. ScriptureScripturestwo TestamentsBibleteaching, and therefore inspiration.  2. When I say 'inspired'not in science or art, etc.   3. Difference of Old and NewOld imperfect, and through so many ages; New perfect, and once for all in one age.  4. Here I shall speak of the New. The Apostlesinspiredour Lord God. Heb. i. 1-2.  5. OBJECTION.Why not their words [inspired], if their writings? Why not their speeches? Why not their conversation? Of course it was. All they said about RELIGION was. They might not know about the earth going round the sun, etc.  6. But it might be objected, on the other hand, that such sayings were not recollected. But some might be.  7. This is what Catholics called 'tradition,' and in which we differ from Protestants. Meaning of the word 'tradition.'  Vide  epistle for this Sunday .  8. Things we know by tradition: (1) that Scripture is the inspired Word of God; (2) what books the Bible consists offor these Protestants need tradition; (3) the Mass, etc.  9. And so natural. Every school, every set of workmen, go by tradition'common law' is tradition.  10. Hence we say there are two parts of the Word of God, written and unwritten.  11. But still, surely tradition  may  go wrong. Yes, and Scripture may be wrongly interpreted.   12. Therefore  the Church  decides, as being infallible.  13. Hence there may be mistaken reports of miracles, prophecies, etc., but we must see what the Church says about them.
