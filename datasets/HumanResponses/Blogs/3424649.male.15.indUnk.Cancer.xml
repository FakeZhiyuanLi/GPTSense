       I just got back from the cinema. The Day After Tomorrow was awesome! The visual effects were some of the best I have ever seen - a rival to Star Wars (probably due to the fact that the effects are by ILM). It's the most intense film I've seen since... well, a long time, anyway. I highly recommend it, but it's not the kind of film where you come out smiling like in Shrek 2. I guess it depends what mood you are in. Anyway, it was one great movie.

       That's right. This evening I had so little homework that I actually had a relaxing evening. I watched nearly all of the extras on disk two of ROTK, and managed to watch about an hour of the actual movie itself. I got up to the fall of Osgiliath. Hopefully I can finish watching watching the movie tomorrow evening. Then, the following day (Saturday), The Day After Tomorrow comes out! I'm literally going to watch it the day after tomorrow.  School was okay today, apart from the fact that I had a geometry test and that our computer lab is now [shudder] quake-free. That's all for now.

       It's approaching the start of summer and the annual movie madness is just beginning! Last Friday, I saw Shrek 2 - it was fantastic! Really, really funny. In fact, I don't think think there was a single dull moment in the entire film. I greatly enjoyed the original Shrek, but Shrek 2 definitely surpassed it (more laughs = better movie). So yeah, I highly recommend seeing it.   Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King came out on DVD today... and it's sitting about 30 feet away from me. I think I'll try to finish my homework early. Then I can begin watching it. (It runs for 3 hours and 20 minutes!)  This Friday, The Day After Tomorrow comes out. I don't think I'll be able to see it on Friday, but I should be able to see it on Saturday  morning. The following Saturday, Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban will be released!  There are many other great films coming out in the next few months (The Bourne Supremacy and The Terminal, to name a few). Movie mania is truly beginning to take shape!

       That's right. I'm now back in Northern CA after spending the past week (up to Thursday night) in Southern Califorina. We visited San Diego, Santa Barbara, Oange County, Malabu, and drove through parts of LA (which, by the way, is the smoggiest city I've ever seen). The "purpose" of the trip was to visit colleges that my sister may want to attend; needless to say, we were able to visit San Diego Zoo, which was was a lot of fun. Below is a summary of the colleges we toured:  Pomona College  - http://www.pomona.edu/ Redlands University - http://www.redlands.edu/ Point Loma University - http://www.ptloma.edu/ University of California, San Diego - http://www.ucsd.edu/ Pepperdine University - http://www.pepperdine.edu/ Westmont College - http://www.westmont.edu/  We also drove around a few campuses, but since that doesn't give you the same insight as a tour, I will not list those colleges here. Throughout our trip, we listened to Harry Potter and the OotP as we drove from place to place. It was great hearing OotP again. I had actually forgotten quite a few little details. I now understand exactly what Dumbledore's plan with  Harry has been. That second-to-last chapter is a great read if you want lots of information. My mom and sister find that part boring, but my dad and I like finding out how all the years "integrate" together. I hear that the 6th HP book is going to be titled Harry Potter and the Pillar of Storgé. However, we will have to wait until July 1st to know for sure. Go to mugglenet.com for more info on the story.  Edit: The Pilar of Storgé was a hoax. The real title of book 6, confirmed by JKR, is Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.

       Sorry I haven't been updating in a while. I can't think of an excuse so here's a "big" blog for you:  So far, my summer holiday is going great. It's so relaxing and two days ago I slept until 10 O'CLOCK! That wasn't so great, though. I'm going to try to get up at 8 in the future. More than 10 hours sleep is OVER-sleep.  Well, I'm back to playing table tennis again. I'm... not as good as I remember. I'm out of practice. I lost to my mom yesterday... that hasn't happened in a long time. I'm dreading playing my dad - I'll get thrashed lol. Oh well, pracice makes perfect.  Although I'm trying to cut down on the computer a little, it's nice to have time to surf the web without thinking "I'd better go study / do homework." I've played some Americas Army - it was fun. (has it ever  not  been fun?) I'm reading a Java book and practicing some Java (I downloaded the Java SDK) for next year. Aside from that, I'm working on my new school site. It's up at /~gmarsh/sophomore if you want to check it out.  Okay.. what else? I'm moving house in July. We spend the last few late-afternoons looking at houses and we found quite a nice one which we are currently signing the papers for. I don't mind moving. It's a pretty nice house. I will miss Lawrence road though... but San Ramon shouldn't be too bad. At least I'm still going to be able to attend MV!  You have to admit. That was a pretty long blog. Oh, and one more thing - THE BOURNE SUPREMACY comes out in just over a month! I'm getting very excited.. and I'm even more excited now because I just found out two days ago that Ocean's 12 is coming out in November. Anyway, this Friday two things happen. One good.. one bad. The bad thing is that the SAT2 scores go online (I'm scared), the good thing is that we're going to see Tom Hanks in The Terminal (which looks HALARIOUS!). That's all for now. Later.

       I say  Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban  yesterday night. It was fantastic! It is much better than the first two. I think that they (or Cauron at least) have realised that since it is impossible to compete with the books' story, why not compete with their action?  Azkaban  was much more of a fan's film then the first two. In other words, they didn't bother introduing characters and settings. I suppose if you hadn't read the books then this film would have been a little hard to undersatnd. Then again, who hasn't read the books???

       Sorry it's been so quite here recently. We're moving house right now and I don't have too much time to get on here and update as oftenly as I would like. Anyway, so far the move is going well. We still have some boxes to move to the new house (we are moving more each day) and a lot of boxes to put into storage. By the way, the next Harry Potter book is goign to be called "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince." The title was confirmed by JKR about a week ago. That's about all the news right now.
