      Well today is my son's fifteenth birthday. We had a family party. We cooked out on the grill. Had a wonderful time. My niece helped me set up this blog. I am so proud of her, she is getting ready to go to medical school yes she is going to be a doctor. She is the first person in my family to grad. collage. I love her very much. Go Mandy Go. :-) Well, I am sure first thing Tuesday I will be taking my son to get his learners permit. I can't wait for him to drive us everywhere we go. I am not looking forward to my car insurance going up. Because of a teenager boy driver. I hear it will triple in cost. We will deal with that when it happens.

      My tooth is still hurting. It is worst now than it was last Tuesday. I am so tired of this. I can't wait to go back to dentist. I hate dentist's. So that is saying a lot for me to look forward to going. A.J. is doing fine bored to death. Says he has nothing to do. I guess that is normal. I am still working. I still don't like it. But it is a job.

      Well A.J. got a rabbit today. It is about 3 weeks old. Black with huge ears. It is the first rabbit I have ever touched. I love it already. They are building a cage for it now. We bought food 25 lbs. the food will last forever.  Now I have something to feed vegetables scraps to.

      I have started working. I hate it. I am calling people on the phone trying to give away a free vacation. I promise it is free. I don't like Tel marketers, but now I have a different out look on them. I won't ever be mean to another one. I'm having a hard time keeping my house work caught up. And laundry done. I am thinking of making the laundry A.J.'s new job. He is good at doing laundry. I am sure he don't want that job but I don't want the one I have either. Life is just that way sometimes.

      I have a tooth ache. I hate it when a tooth hurts. I am going to the dentist in the morning at 8AM. I don't like getting up early or going to the dentist. So does that mean that tomorrow is going to be a bad day. I hope not. A.J. spent the night with his aunt Billie. He is on vacation and thinks he shouldn't have to do anything.

      Are all teenagers rude and crude or just the one that lives at my house? A.J. is so moody he cant stand himself. Now he is being rude to people on the phone. What is a parent to do? If you say anything then he get mad and stays in his room. If you say nothing then that is say that it is OK to be rude. Being a parent is one of the hardest thing in the world to do and do it well.

      We went swimming at the river today. It was way to cold for me. It is a mountain stream. I set on the bank and watched. I put my feet in and that is all. For about 30 seconds.  Burr!!!!!!!

      I have a question. Why do insurance company have control over what medications you can take? My husbands doctor wrote him a prescription and our insurance refused to give him the full amount because they don't want him to take it. Now I thought your doctor was the one that decided what medincine you needed and how much of it you needed. I guess that is not the case. The insurance company said they wanted him to take the medicine every other day and not every day. What happen to the doctors of this country? Why does things like that happen? I am just amazed by it all. Ok I will get off my soap box now. A.J. went to Dollywood today with a friend that is a girl but not a girl friend. LOL So he says. I am sure that they are having loads of fun.  Have a great day everyone.

      I must have been really tired. I have slept most of the day and now I am wide awake. Go figure. I made some banana bread tonight and it is really good. It is the first time I have ever made bread. It was so easy. I will be doing that again.

      I had a housewarming party yesterday. I got a lot of things I really needed. My bedroom looks 100% better. I got a bed in a bag and it is perfect. I and Mandy went to Wal-Mart and got pillows for the bed and that really toped it off. Thanks Mandy. Mandy found herself a suit too. Hope you get the job if it is the one you want. I am going to miss you and Jeremy. A.J. is gone again. He went with a friend to spent the night. Do all teenagers want to stay away from home? Then when they are gone they want to come back. Moody is not the word for it. I will be glad when this teenager stuff is behind us. I will post another blog today before going to bed.

      A.J. didn't make it till Friday. He is coming home tonight. I sure hope he is in a better mood. I have been so busy while he had been away. Today I stayed home all day and I have been playing on POGO and cleaning my house. I am getting ready for my housewarming party. The party is Saturday at 4 PM. I can't wait. It is going to be a lot of fun.

      I hate to shop. It is the worst thing ever. I went shopping today with my niece Audrey. She was buying school clothes. She is starting collage on Monday. I am so proud of her.  A.J. called today he is wanting to come home early surprise surprise. I hope he is in a better mood when he gets home. He is so moody. He is not happy any where he is. He can go from being mad to being happy in the same breath. I always thought girls were worst but now I think boys are.

      I don't know if I am happy or sad about A.J. being gone till Friday. He is gone to bible camp in Ringgold Ga. He rode down with a friend from church. No adults on the ride down. He is staying with an old pastor of ours for the week. He always has a great time. He usually come home fire up for God and with a better attitude. I hope he does this time too. We all could use a week to worship and get ourselves closer to God. I know I could. Pray for A.J.'s safe return.

      I have spent the evening in the ER. No it was not me that had to go. It wasn't A.J. or Tank either. It was A.J.'s friend he broke his collar bone. He will have to have surgery to fix it. He is 13 and in a lot of pain. Nick needs our prayers. He summer is not going to be good. I feel so bad he got hurt. He and A.J. was riding A.J.'s 3 wheeler. Nick was riding in a wagon behind the 3 wheeler. Thank God I always make them wear a helmet. Nick fell out of the wagon onto his shoulder. His mom met us at the ER. It scared her some but not to bad. I am glad she didn't panic. Please remember them in your prayers. I will keep you posted on Nick.

      Tank and A.J. and some of A.J.'s friends went tubing on the lake yesterday. They are all sore from holding onto the tube while being pulled behind the boat at 32 mph. I don't do tubing. I didn't once and that was my first, last and only time for me. lol I was scared to death. Tank said my eyes were as big as saucers. It was a few years ago. We still laugh about it. A.J.'s friends stayed the night and we all went to church this morning. The kids are all swimming now. I bet they will sleep good again tonight. I now I will.

      A.J. has been out of school for the summer less than a week. He is bored and always asking to go somewhere and do something. I guess I have only myself to blame. I have always been on the go. He is running me to death. I just want to stay home 1 day and catch my breath. We went and seen The Day After Tomorrow. It is a great movie. I would like to see it again and again. I wonder what tomorrow will bring for me.

      He passed the test for the driving permit. He missed 4 questions. A.J. was so happy and he has driven everywhere we have been since. I like not having to drive.

      Well do all teenagers really think they know everything? I believe they think they do. But when they get about 22 they realize they know very little. I remember thinking my mother was the most stupid  person alive. Now I am thought of that way. The Bible says we reap 7 fold what we sow. I am starting to reap some of my sowing. It is much harder to reap than to sow. My son is wonderful and my mother says that I was a good child to. And as she finishes that statement in compared to my sister. My sister was into everything coming and go so I guess I was a wonderful child. LOL I only have 1 child so I have nothing to compare to. That is a good thing I think. I am looking forward to the summer with A.J.. We do lots of things together. Like swimming and fishing and going on the lake to ride tubes. We camp too. I hope we have a great summer and not disagree to much.

      Is summer time just a lazy time for everyone or just me? I stay up late and sleep late everyday.  I guess it is to hot to do much of anything. My tooth is getting better. Still hurts but better than it was. The dentist &nbsp;put me back on antibiotic again. A.J. has had friends over every day for a month it seems. A.J. and Tank are gone now to pick up 2 of his friends now. They are going to spend the night.They are the ones that like to play Nintendo games. So I will be up most of the night playing. Summer I love it.

      I have stayed up till 6 am the last 2 night in a row. I was having so much fun. Playing Nintendo. Yes playing a stupid game. Super Mario 64. It is a old game but I love it. Me and A.J. and 2 of his friends have played it together. We lose our turn when we get a star or we die. It is wonderful. It is fun to be spending time with A.J. doing something that is fun.

      I went to the parade in Gatlinburg Tn last night. It is the first parade for the 4th in the country. It starts at midnight. I took 5 kids with me. I swear one of the kids was like the energizer bunny. He never stopped talking. I was about nuts when I got home. The parade was nice but I won't be taking that many kids again.

      I have been so busy. Working and taking care of home. I have been sick too. Down in my back and then a sinus infection. I have missed 2 days of work this week already. I am starting to feel better now. I hope to work tomorrow. We go to court Thursday. Audrey is fighting to keep her parental rights. I hope she does win, and soon she will get Katryna back. Audrey should not have lost her to begin with. Just pray about it all. You know stress does terrible thing to your body. This the the 3rd time I have been sick in a month. I know it is stress related.
