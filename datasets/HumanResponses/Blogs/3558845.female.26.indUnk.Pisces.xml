      well, i have an unexpected long break before my next shift at six, so i thought i would write some.  first of all, this blog is not written for eric or anyone else.  it's for me.  there will be one paragraph in today's blog that includes anything personal.  that's it.  the decision that dan and i have made together will not be discussed.  it's no one else's business.  all i really want to say about the whole situation is that i'm disappointed.  despite many attempts, i couldn't get it through someone's head that reactions are not misunderstandings.  the comment was made that i chose someone else because he was in a better financial situation.  how sad that someone that claims to know me so well thinks i'm so superficial.  ironically, that was one of the main reasons dan wanted to be with me--because i wasn't superficial.  i have many other comments to make about a certain post on a certain blog.....but i'm not going to.  they've all been made before and you can't make someone understand who doesn't want to.  so it doesn't matter anymore.  c'est la vie.  time to move on.....  i actually get a day off tomorrow.  i was going to get my hair hightlighted, but i don't think i should spend the money yet.  i have rent and bills coming up, so i'm gonna try to do the responsible thing.  i am gonna go jump in a tanning bed for a little while, though.  haven't tanned in a few days.  having withdrawals.  i hope everyone has a wonderful night!

      please read the next blog all the way to the end, even though you might think that it's going to hurt, just from reading the first couple of paragraphs.  the rest of it might even make sense.

      i have alot to talk about.  i actually have the afternoon alone, and i'm welcoming it with open arms.    i'm going to be completely honest with you.  i hope you can appreciate that, and not fly off the handle over the first couple of paragraphs.  i have alot more to say after that.  dan and i have been together for about six weeks.  i was afraid to tell you for one very important reason--i didn't want to get a phone call in the middle of the night saying that you had done something to yourself.  i'm still going to be afraid of that.  but now i'm going to have to trust God to take care of you.  you asked me if i was in love with dan and i said no.  i wasn't exactly lying.  i'm just not sure.  i definitely love him, and i'm happy being around him, but i'm not sure if i'm in love or not.  we have pretty much the same conversations every day--which are about you.  honestly, he's not happy about my interaction with you.  you can see why now.  he has alot of insecurity and stress about that, and it's affecting our relationship.  i told him last night that, either way, i would lose a friend.  because of his decision not to be around you (which he still stands by, and i have to respect that), if i chose you, i would lose him.  if i chose to stay with him, then i would feel bad for not respecting his wishes, and i would lose you.  i feel trapped and very stressed out.  there is alot of love there, but dan and i have not had the picture-perfect relationship so far.  it's really weird--while i crave solitude above anything else right now, i'm afraid to be alone.  i don't depend on you or on dan for my happiness, but i'm still scared.  dan is constantly reading my face and asking me what i'm thinking, and most of the time i don't want to tell him.  i just want to think and keep it to myself.  but when i say 'nothing' he automatically thinks that i'm thinking about you.  then he gets sad and even more stressed out.  and that, in turn, does the same thing to me.  it's a vicious cycle.  what stresses me out is the promises i made to you that you've brought up.  i promised when we broke up that i would welcome you back with open arms.  trust me, i did not see everything coming that has happened--dan falling in love with me, your reactions, my feelings toward them--none of it.  that doesn't mean that i'm trying to release myself from my promise.  i've cried on way more than one occasion over it.  i promised you that i would never turn my back on you and that i would always be here for you.  i cry every time i think about that.  i'm crying now.  because i feel trapped and that any decision i make will end up hurting someone so much.  i've been allowing dan to love me and take care of me, so in a sense i feel guilty because i feel like i replaced you too soon.  i know you're probably thinking about that, too, and hurting.  i'm so sorry.  before you and i were together, i always looked at dan and saw someone that i could be perfectly happy with for the rest of my life.  he was confident, straight-forward, secure with himself, and had his priorities in order.  he also knew exactly what he was looking for and didn't depend on anyone else for his happiness.  all of this is what was going through my head the night he told me that he loved me (along with shock).  i'm afraid that everything that's happened has made him different.  i never saw him afraid before.  never saw insecurity in him.  i'm afraid that it's made him a different person, and i'm afraid that he's relying on me too much for his happiness.  he watches me all the time.  he watches my face, and if it changes, even if i'm not thinking about anything important, he gets worked up because he thinks i'm upset or that i'm thinking about you.  and when i try to talk to him about some of these things, he gets defensive.  so i don't know what's going to happen.  but, just for clarification, we are in no way, shape, or form sleeping together.  dan will stay a virgin as long as he's with me, until he gets married.  i don't know what else to say.  i hope that i've made the right decision in telling you all of this.  i felt the same way dan did--he felt like he was lying to you by not telling you.  he was just alot braver than me and told you a long time ago how he felt.  he's worried about me telling you this because he's scared that i'm going to get the same reaction from you that he got.  i personally think that i trust you more than that.  i know you won't ever physically hurt me.  but i've told the absolute truth now.  i'm not hiding anything, but i hope this blog stays between me and you.  if you need to talk about this some more, we can.    i just feel like i'm not going to be able to make anyone happy.  on one side i have you telling me how you feel and that hopefully we'll be able to get back together, and on the other side i have dan accusing me of never being able to let you go and telling me to move on.  i feel so trapped.  as far as me and you....i don't know.  i miss you alot.  i love you, and the idea of you lying in bed and crying and trying so hard to get me back and hurting so much hurts me more than you can imagine.  but i don't know how close i can be to you right now because i honestly don't know what i want from you.  and i don't want to encourage you and give you hope and then realize that it's never going to work out.  i don't want to hurt you any more than i already have.  the idea of not being able to be there to comfort you at night hurts me.  especially when i have someone with me.  i'll admit it's probably because you're stronger than me.  what i'm sorrier for more than anything is that my weakness caused you pain.  please forgive me for that.  i just don't know what to do.  but i want you to know that you're not the only one hurting and crying.  someone else is sharing that with you.  even though i have someone with me, it's not someone who can completely understand....it makes me feel very alone.  the only one who can understand is you.  please continue to pray for me, and please be patient.  i love you, and i miss you.  amber

      i'm finding it easier to post a new entry on my own blog than to post alot of comments on yours.  i hope you don't mind.  i'm sorry you couldn't sleep last night.  i went to bed really early and actually got plenty of sleep.  hopefully you fell asleep and you'll get pleny of sleep before work.  i hope you make alot of money tonight, too.  i turned in all my health insurance stuff yesterday and went on a little cleaning frenzy around my house.  gave me a little sense of accomplishment.  i had a really good food-running shift last night, too.  i have the weekend off and my bar and wine class on monday.  take my last test on tuesday and hopefully be on the floor on my own by tuesday night.    "For God has not given us a spirit of fearfulness, but one of power, love, and sound judgement."           ~2 Tim. 1:7  i read that yesterday and thought of you and dan both.  i can't think of anything else i really need to talk about at the moment....i'm sure i'll post again later.

      wow.  haven't done this in a long time.  since last summer, anyway.  and we both know how that ended up.  so you're the only one who's gonna know this address.    first of all, i just wanted to let you know that this isn't always going to be a serious blog.  half the reason i wanted to start this was for me--to remind myself of things that i want to personally accomplish.  it isn't always going to be about you--when it is, you'll know.  but you won't always know what i'm talking about, since i intend to write about pretty much everything that's on my mind and everything that's happened to me.  i started thinking today about how much i needed to get my life back together.....just little things that i've been putting off because i haven't taken any time to myself.  i started trying to fix that situation by cleaning house today.  speaking of which, i finally had to throw my flowers away.  they had just about had it.  there are so many other little things i need to do--i need to stop by the financial aid office at letourneau and talk to jennifer about starting to pay back some of my loans. (i mean, all i need is another monthly bill, right?).  i need to finish studying for my marketing and finance finals so i can take them and be done with that.  all these tests at carino's are taking up so much time.  and i'm really missing my parkeway membership.  truthfully, i'm missing outback.  i don't like the people at carino's at all.  people down there ask me how i like it so far, and i have to hesitate and plan my words before i answer them.  i just wish i could get my life back to normal.  i didn't miss waiting tables at all during the last two weeks when i didn't have a job, but i hate having to stress about not having my own money.  i hate depending on someone else to take care of me.  i know dan didn't mind helping me at all and he would do it again in a heartbeat, but i hate feeling like i've lost my independence.  i'm irritated because at the rate carino's is going, it'll be next tuesday or wednesday before i'm on the floor by myself, and it's getting to be time for bills to start showing up again.  grrrrr...  i also started thinking about something you had mentioned in one of your posts....it was something i told you first.  if you love something very much, let it go.  if it doesn't come back to you, it was never yours to begin with.  if it does come back to you, it's yours forever.  i've been encouraging you to let go so things can get better and we can live our own lives seperately, when i'm the one who's having trouble letting go.  i want to apologize for that.  i understand now what you meant when you told me that i was selfish.  i'm so scared of letting you go because you're such a big part of my life and because i'm scared of what my life would be like if you weren't in it.  you've been my best friend for a long time.  i don't want to lose you, but at the same time i know we can't be together because i know we wouldn't be happy.  i just don't know what to do.  i guess i'm just scared and selfish and i need to grow up.  hopefully telling you all of this is the first step, because i've been terrified of telling you what's really on my heart.  i'm scared of your reactions.  the thought of you being sad or upset or depressed and knowing i'm the cause of it hurts me more than i know how to handle.  i absolutely hate the idea of hurting anyone.  but you told me once that you would rather i tell you the truth, and that you wished that my unwillingness to hurt you wasn't a factor, so i'm trying to give up my way of doing things (which has been a failure and hurt more than one person) and focus on your way of doing things.  i also know that i haven't focused on God enough, and that i haven't been trusting Him to take care of you or dan or myself, for that matter.  i'm going to focus more on trying to change that.  it's all part of the healing process, i guess.  it's a hard thing to accept that none of this (including your feelings and dan's feelings) is in my control.  i'm going to have to focus more on trusting God and doing what He wants me to do.    right now i think he wants me to focus on laundry.  so i better go, since my work clothes are in there.  i have my food running shift tonight, and then i have to come home and start studying for my bar test.  i'm so happy for you right now.  i'm so glad that sam did what he did....it really was an answer to prayer.
