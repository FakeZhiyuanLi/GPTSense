      Someone asked me what is it about life that confuses me? The problem is that I truly do not know the answer to that question. If I just sit and think for a very long time multiple things race through my head about the purpose of life but I arrive at no conclusions. I find this very frustrating. I am seventeen and only one of about 6 billion people in the world. I am on a pseudo crusade to discover something that I am good at. Maybe there isn't anything. But there at least has to be something I have a passion for. I love learning and experiencing new and different things. There is so much I want to do with my life and the clock is already ticking away. Right now, I'm as young as I will ever be, yet there is nothing I can do. I am stuck in this sheltered bubble. When am I supposed to able accomplish and see amazing things? I am scared I will not be able to. Society has limited me from learning and experiencing everything I would ever hope to. Soviety has set a path for me. I could always create a new path for myself but it would result in me being seen as a "failure" in the eyes of my peers and family which would be fine because my alternate path WOULD eventually lead to failure without anyone to privately sponsor my hopes and dreams. Because in today's world you can't get anywhere with money. So ultimately I would end up in a cardboard box or working at McDonald's. Okay, so back to society's pre-destined path: One more year of high school and then it's off to college. And then probably graduate school. And after that I will be submerged into the corporate world where I will struggle to market the one "talent" that my college of choice has helped me to find. If I am fortunate enough for my talent to be needed by corporate entities I imagine I shall settle down somewhere. Maybe raise a family but,hey there's really no point in that. They'll be at school, I'll be working. We'd only see eachother on the weekends, and we'd be too tired to communicate by nightfall. Will the children of the future really need ANOTHER corporate mom? I think not. I continue this daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly routine(the same one that has haunted me since kindergarten)so that I can produce enough money to live "comfortably". Then for 30 years I will continue this dreadful cycle so that I can retire and have only a small portion of my social security earnings find their way back to me. By the time I reach sixty years old I will have neither the energy nor the health to pursue all the imaginary endeavors that I fabricated when I was seventeen and still in good health. Am I pessimistic? Yes. Am I looking forward to the future? Of course!

      So I've been sick for a while. Boohoo. I went riding today and now my ass really hurts. While at first I was tricked into believing I enjoyed my spanish class, I have recently discovered my teacher is none other than the anti-christ. I started some crazy drawings, maybe if i fill the whole page I'll post it. I saw Harry Potter, enough said. Oh Donnie Darko how I love thee so! I watched it twice in a row and then once more with the commentary. I'm convinced if he was real, we'd be soulmates. CDs I have to buy: Mogwai-Happy Songs for Happy People. Ok, nevermind it's only one, but i am being lazy and refuse to backspace. I've been offered the opportunity to travel wherever i want for 4 nights. First thought that comes to mind: diving. Cayman Islands. Maybe, I'm not 100 percent sure yet. Feel free to share any thoughts. Tommorow I have a Birmingham Belles Luncheon so yes, I get to stand around in a pretty dress for no reason. Sickening, I know. I might post those pictures too. Well that's all i got.  Current Song: StellaStar - My Coco :) P.S. Rent "Melvin Goes to Dinner". You won't regret it. Make it a blockbuster night.

      Today was my first day of summer school. Uhh.. It was weird but I think I like my teacher. There is an emo couple in my class; they are really creepy and a chinese guy with a mullet; makes me wonder. Anyways I really want to go to the Pixies concert so if anyone wants to donate tickets to me, go for it. I went riding today and met Laney. I'm doing a lot better at cavaletties, posting, and 2 point position. I have to start running and going to the gym again. Hopefully the pool is being drained sometime next week so that I won't have to take like 3 showers a day. Last night I found the funniest blog of someone who claims to be Andy Kaufman. I'll post the link later. Well I'm off to better and exciting things..riiight.. Current Song: Where is my Mind - The Pixies

      Today has been so rough. I've been trying to sort through summer school options, last minute of course. So i wake up bright and early, ya know around 10. And head out to tuscaloosa. Of course the advisor was out to lunch. Waiting...waiting... more waiting...Finally I get rejected! Like I would have wanted to commute that far everyday anyways. So I ring Jeff State and classes began May 26th, so that was no longer an option. Full tank of gas later, we arrive at UCD looking for a foreign languages counselor. Point A to Point G to Point Q to Point C (getting closer...) Yes Point B! The Humanities Building. Victory. I step inside my classroom which only has an entrance from the outside, kind of reminds me of camp or somewhere scary like camp. The class room had nothing in it. Just this box of cemement. No windows, no posters. So depressing. This should be an interesting experience. UCD in general is one chaotic mess. The traffic, the posted crime warnings, the parking (or lack thereof). After getting my textbook i headed home. My classes are Mon. Wed. Fri. 9:40 a.m - 11:02 a.m. Finally I have two definate commitments for summer. Horseback riding and Spanish. One plus to everything is that the workmen at the stables speak nothing but spanish. Maybe I'll get some practice in. Well for now I'm going to try and figure out bloggerbot.

      My first post! Woop di fucking doo! Well I'm me, a confused girl just trying to sort life out. In someways my life is this vaccuum of nothingness, things are just sucked right through and contribute to this big ball of nothingness. But sometimes I step back and say wow, everything about this life is so weird, so then again everything and anything is probably worth it to me. Yes, yes, i will admit it. I am easily amused, why else would I have this thing. I despise the idea of "an online diary". So NO! this is nothing of the sort. It is only let's say a 'log' of rants and ramblings of yours truly. No, I will not erupt every single detail of my day onto the screen because I understand that NO ONE GIVES A FUCK. This is for my own amusement or relief. Whichever I choose. I shall write, I shall copy, I shall deliver news. Any questions?

      I just got back from Atlanta. We went to go get parts for the stove, because it only lights manually (which is a pain in the ass). So me and my dad are going to try to do it together, by ourselves. This should be fun. We got directions from like 30 service techs, so it shouldn't be too hard. However I have learned that if something can go wrong, it will. I also spent like 4 hours in a tack shop in Gainesville today. It is the cutest town and reminds me of Fairhope. I really liked it. I got new pants, and sat in like a million different saddles. We ate in a restaurant called&nbsp;'2&nbsp;dog Cafe'.&nbsp;The owner/chef decorated it so cool, and his wife owns an art gallery called 'The Artichoke' that was located upstairs but it just moved next door. They seem so lucky to have a situation like that, I hope when I'm older I can have a little dealio like that. I'm on my last chapter of Spanish. It is so hard. I've totally procrastinated doing my workbook, because it's so hard. Oh well I usually work better in the morning once I get to the classroom and have a table to spread out on, so maybe it will all come to me then. My final is next week, err August 9, i THINK that's next week. I have a huge problem of keeping track of time during the summer, but I guess it's good not to have to worry with such a silly thing like time. The final isn't cumulative, and I haven't decided if that's good or bad.

      I needed a break. Not that alot has been going on though.   I am so fed up with being stuck in my house. It is constant. And with school, it's hard to escape. Also something that has kept me from posting is that 'Hello' only lets me post .jpeg pictures and it's hard to find artwork that isn't .art, so i guess I will have to sign up with photobucket or something. I hate signing up for stuff.  I guess I shall start with Saturday because my short term memory only spans for that long.   Saturday I set out to drive a car with a manual transmission. It's something I've always wanted to be able to do, so I figured I might as well get it out of the way while I was still young. We set out to the dealership in Jasper (i practically live at the damn place now) and they let us borrow a 5 speed manual nissan pickup truck. Sooo we drove home and I got down to business in a parking lot. And by Sunday morning I was ready for the open road. So we drove to Auburn and man oh man, it was a long drive. I got to drive through the campus which I love. It's so country out there. We drove out to my Uncle Bud's farm (he's not really my uncle? Maybe my godfather?), which I didn't know existed until we arrived. I completely fell in love with the place. It was just plain comfortable and I felt like I was meant to be there. It was soo strange: I've always hated rural areas and the thought of being far out from the city or serial killers getting loose but something changed. Huge grassy fields, a barn --horses, kittens, and puppies running around, it was like the most amazing place and I wanted to move in right then. Not a single fancy thing about it, these 2 farriers were renting it from Bud, living in mobile homes and everything, and they seemed like the two happiest, laid back men ever to live. Maybe I am a city girl, but I know that at least once in my life I&nbsp;want the experience of living on a farm. Just visiting that place made up&nbsp;for all the stress of re-learning how to drive.   &nbsp; Oh yeah so flash back to Saturday night. I hung out with Mitchell, who is truly one of the most amazing people I've ever met. He's one of those people that belongs in my life. I know when someone belongs when they know every single little thing about them, and they know every single little thing about me, yet spending time with the person is time that i wouldn't trade for anything. Oh yeah so back to what we did. Hm, not really anything. Oooh! I invented a new drink that is the shiznatch. 3 parts Mountain Dew and 1 part Jones' Soda- Fufu Berry. Mitchell came up with the name: Fufu Dew. Ha, you can tell we're running out of things to do. He took me to Target which was a big mistake, and I ended up spending $80. Bummer. But I did get Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume 2 - and the case art is soo cool, a new awesome skirt although I've got nowhere to wear it, and a totally cool gray cord jacket. Woop woop.   Oh yeah so flash back to today, which totally sucked. I went to class and got a 93 on test and did the hokey pokey and head and shoulders knees and toes knees and toes to practice body parts. It was craziness. And then we had to take the truck back to the dealership, thank god. Not only do I not want a manual car, but pretty much despise redlights now too. Getting back in a regular car totally screwed with my mind, my foot kept searching for the clutch and I kept wanting to downshift when coming to a stop, oh well. Then it started pouring down rain on the way home so every couple of miles there was a wreck or people who had run off the side of the road so there were major onlooker delays. Curse them. Now I'm just rambling.   P.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; Papa Johns' Barbecue Chicken Pizza w/out the Bacon is pretty darn tastey.

      There are important minor incidents in my dreams that keep reoccuring: I am constantly finding myself visiting this non existant restaurant. Also at this restaurant whenever I go to eat there, I'm seated at a table and soon after the all the staff decides to go on a lunch break;failing to inform me. When I wander back to the kitchen it is empty and no one is to be found except this one elderly back woman - who questions me about where my life is headed. I know I've had this dream at least 5 times now for sure. Another frequent thing is that I am constantly running into people I know, yet we do not speak to eachother. I'm not sure if this is because I'm in another world where we do not know eachother, or they want to avoid talking to me, as much as I would like to ignore them. There was one more thing I wanted to mention, but of course my short-term memory is failing me. I was once told that when you wake up you lied in bed for at least 10 minutes, you could let all of your dreams from the past night flow into you. But if you jumped right out of the bed, and into the shower, you would have difficulty remembering any of them. I should start allowing my dreams to re-establish a connection to me in the waking world, however often they frighten me. I feel like prey to my dreams. They scare me, because I am unsure of what it is that my mind is trying to tell me. I can never tell in my dreams that I'm dreaming ever, and ultimately feel hopeless, lost, and helpless. Some claim that they can manipulate their dreams. However that seems like risky business. The dreamworld is something that is very scary, yet very interesting, because I want to know more about myself and the world around me. Maybe I should pursue some research.  Do you dream in black in white?  I really hate blogger's new posting layout.

      Life is a very complicated situation. Why must everything be so complicated. It shouldn't be at all. People, and I'm speaking for myself as well, shouldn't be so uptight and let things get to themselves so easily. One of my favorite bumper stickers is 'Shit Happens'. Even though it's so punkish and "iwannabeabadass"ish, it speaks the truth. Things happen and life goes on, yet often when bad things happen to people they stand at a standstill yet the clock is still ticking. I've learned that the more you dwell on things, the more it will tear you apart and that life doesn't have to be so complicated.  There are countries with lots and lots of people just struggling to survive. Never knowing when they will eat their next meal, or whether they will get medicine when they are sick. Yet all of these people tend to enjoy life to the fullest. Yet in countries such as America there is a bunch of whining drama queens who have been raised with no respect or morals and when things don't go their way they practically lay down to die or threaten suicide. (Wow this kind of reminds me of the movie Thirteen)But who's to blame? It it the parents? Society? Media? Being raised in America with the strictest and most caring parents, I have been given such wonderful opportunities that I often take for granted. Opportunities that kids in other places could only dream of. And although I haven't quite decided whether I should regret this, I do know that the future is quite a scary place being run by a bunch of out of control, rebellious, sluts, but then again, I can't speak for everyone. I hope this doesn't offend, because this wasn't the intention.

I saw a lot of Van Gogh's work in Musee D'Orsay in Paris which is my favorite museum of all time.     Mulberry trees are so awesome. I even have one in my front yard. Every year silkworms take it over and my dad starts a war them them and tries to kill all of them even though they are so cool and would never want to hurt anyone :(  The people who make crossword puzzles for the newspaper know way too many useless 3 letter and 4 letter words. Grrr.   I read an article in Business Week about the future of androids and now I'm really freaked out. For any of you who aren't freaked out about technology and the future be sure to see the disney original movie 'smarthouse'. That's only a mild example of the calamity that is yet to come.

       urlLink    Eek! Chad Ginsburg. I know I know, I'm in the same room as him, how cool is that? Not only is he an amazing guitarist but he wears a leather jacket. Okay, well maybe happiness doesn't = chad but it's a good start. I've lost track of time.   Happiness to me can be broken down into these three categories: Plenty of Privacy Being in Good Company Lots o' Music     One thing that bothers me more than anything in the world is not leaving people alone to do their own thing. This would probably fit in the privacy category.For instance, it's ALWAYS obvious when an outsider's commentary is welcome. If there is something I enjoy doing it is almost always ruined by outside influence. It's one thing to ASK for help or opinions, but a different thing to be bombarded with suggestions and demands. For instance, "Oh you are trying that now? Here, I'll go get 20 books from the library and I want you to read every single one from cover to cover and then I'll tell you how to do it my way oh and I suggest you should use that also!" Aww? Really you'd do that for me just so that you can ruin the one thing I'm really starting to enjoy? Thank you!   My day was absolutely delightful. I woke up at 8 and got to Spanish early so I could present my project and leave before class even began, oh the joys of a college class. Then I went shopping oh yes shopping. I know it sounds like a bad idea, but I controlled myself to a point.   Lane recommends: Cafe Vanilla Frap from none other than Starbucks  So after shopping I laid out for a while by the pool, went swimming, yada yada. Watched Chasing Amy. No one cares..   I need to stop writing just to have something down. This is a disgrace.

      That's exactly how long I have to finish this before my battery dies. The power went out and I'm typing by candlelight. I love it when the power goes out because everything goes really still and you get to play with lots of matches. I finally finished getting everything ready for my Dad's accountant and I'm meeting with him on Thursday. Also on Thursday I have to drive up to Jasper AGAIN! I'm so sick of this. They think the problem with the landcruiser was that it was struck by lightning. They think? Well that have no explanation for a 100amp fuse being blown so that's their only answer. Dad wants the dealership to buy it back from us but that's alot of money and they probably won't. Tommorow I have spanish class and I'm spazzing just a little bit because I have all this stuff do on Friday and I don't know how I'm going to get all of it done. Tommorow I am going to get up early and see if I can finish the lab work before class. Oh and I had the best barbeque I've ever had at Greentop on highway 78. I love it when my family decides to cut off all the water in the house while I'm in the shower without informing me. I wish Edwards wasn't Kerry's runningmate.I can't wait until I can start using the pool daily. I've wanted to for a long time, but there are always workmen around it. There are so many dvds that I want to buy, but I'm slowly going broke now that I'm unemployed. Sigh. This weekend I am going to bake so many cookies, woop woop. I think it's really exciting that you can apply to be in the FBI online, I think I'm beginning to lose alot of faith in the government. I might consider. Like for instance, now you don't even have to have a highschool diploma to be accepted into the police academy. That's exactly what we need... more idiots running around with power. I watched the movie Magnolia last night. It made me hate Tom Cruise and love Julianne Moore. I think she's one of my favorite actesses. Her character was just so believable. The movie itself was extremely strange and has such a silly climax. So I still have yet to make up my mind about it. I also think that I want a pet iguana now. I loved the ones in Aruba. Mmmm.

       urlLink    This piece was done by the one and only Chagall. All of his work has a sort of dream-like fairy tale appeal to it.   Oh yeah the Internal Revenue Service sucks and they know it. I spent all day trying to prepare my un-organized and irresponsible father's tax return. I was interrupted by some drunk people trying to get on the roof of the building next door to watch the fireworks. Happy 4th to me. I haven't even touched any of my spanish homework yet, and I'm beginning to think that I won't until wednesday morning. It's been hard to concentrate because we hired some people to rip out the back patio and put in a new one. They haven't yet failed to wake me up every morning at exactly 7 a.m. So not only am I sleep deprived, I'm also incapable of concentration. I think over the next couple of days I am going to start working on my college essays or at least the topics for the commonap. I am freaked just thinking about it, but maybe if i start now, they will turn out fine. Why do they pick the worst topics?!? Like "Describe the most important even in your life" they might as well ask me to name my favorite song! And I still have summer reading to do! Which is so stupid. These are the books I have to read: Cat's Cradle, Into Thin Air, and Things Fall Apart. Oh the joys of attending a public school. I skipped out on my senior picture. I've got plenty of other things to concern myself with other than worrying about horrible yearbook picture. They'll probably figure it out though and track me down.   Things I would recommend:  The 'Franz Ferdinand' CD - it's one of those cd's where every song is good. Seeing the movie 'Dodgeball' - guys seem to really like. Eh it has it's moments.  Eating a gyro - OMG! They are so good.   Yeah, that's all I got.

       urlLink    Here is a Dali painting. Although the melting clocks are way cool, they are way too overused. This is so surreal, it makes me want to leap into the painting and touch the rose.   I had a wonderful night; many thanks to everyone who contributed.   For those of you wanting to know more about me...

      if a cheerfulest Elephantangelchild should sit  (holding a red candle over his head  by a finger of trunk, and singing out of a red  book)on a proud round cloud in a white high night  where his heartlike ears have flown adorable him self tail and all(and his tail's red christmas bow) --and if, when we meet again, little he (having flown even higher) is sunning his penguinsoul in the glow  of a joy which wasn't and isn't and won't be words   while possible not (at a guess) quite half way down to the earth are leapandswooping tinily birds whose magical gaiety makes your beautiful name--  i feel that (false and true are merely to know) Love only has ever been, is, and will ever be,So                 -e.e. cummings   ***************************************************** I consider e.e. cummings to be one of the greatest  writers of all time. Although he is most often recognized  for his poetry, he has also published many works of fiction, criticism, and cultural history, while  being a painter and an editor all at the same time. He is a personal favorite of mine with his standard breaking language techniques, originality, and satire. All of his writing is so interesting, it's hard to stop  reading once you start. The piece above and the ones to  follow truly stuck out at me today.   Why do you paint? For exactly the same reason I breathe.  That's not an answer.  How long hasn't there been an answer? As long as I can remember? I mean poetry. So do I.  Tell me, doesn't your painting interfere      with your writing? Quite the contrary;they love eachother dearly. They're very different. Very: one is painting and one is writing. But your poems are rather hard to understand,whereas      your paintings are so easy. Easy? Of course--you paint flowers and girls and sunset;      things that everybody understands. I never met him.  Who? Everybody.  Did you ever hear of a nonrepresentational painter? I am.  Pardon me? I am a painter, and painting is nonrepresentational. Not all painting. No:housepainting is representational. And what does a housepainter represent? Ten dollars an hour.  In other words, you don't want to be serious-- It takes two to be serious. Well, let's see...oh yes, one more question:      where will you live after this war is       over? In China, as usual.  China? Of course. Whereabouts in China? Where a painter is a poet.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ death has a smile like the nicest man you've never met who maybe winks at you in a streetcar and you pretend you don't but really you do see and you are My how glad he winked and  hope he'll do it again.

       urlLink     Please take a moment to recognize the newly updated pictures page. It took some effort on my part so indulge in it. It has been the reason for my lack of posting. Next on my blog to-do list: blogs I frequently read, so stay tuned.   I feel completely exhausted. But it is a good exhausted.  I believe there are two types of exhaustion:  Type 1) Sitting around doing nothing all day, locked indoors. This situation               causes intense mental cacaphony, feelings of insanity (especially if you've decided to hype yourself up on caffeine), and feelings similar to that of a worn out record. In my case the tension mounts where I feel tiny little particles swimming around in my bones begging for physical exertion.   Type 2) Oh the glory one might find in Type 2. Type 2 exhaustion is usually a sign of accomplishment or living productively. This is often characterized by the completion of both mental and physical tasks and is well deserving of a nice hot bath at the end of the day.   Today I found myself falling victim to Type 2 exhaustion... to make a long boring drawnout pointless story short: :wokeupearly: spanishexam: horsebackridingfor3hoursinthehothotsun: flattire:waitingroom: groceryshopping: yumyumwatermelon: 6:00news:madedinner: foundeverysinglehotellistedintheabacosonexpedia.com :andyesitookmywelldeservedhotbath:  Oh yeah that painting is way abstract. Kandinsky.    I was listening to the radio and they had a dream interpreter as a guest. A man called in and explained that he had a reoccuring dream of trolls chasing him in an underground maze. The woman's interpretation explained that he had problems facing up to his ugliness OR he just played way too many videogames when he was younger. How about a bit of both?

        LittleStereo86:   Scientists at Russia's Voronezh State Technological Academy have found a way to make chocolate, pastries and fermented drinks out of blood. The baked results are so good, they report, that researchers kept eating all the research.  Bloophrantic:   that's disgusting? human blood?   LittleStereo86:   No idea?
