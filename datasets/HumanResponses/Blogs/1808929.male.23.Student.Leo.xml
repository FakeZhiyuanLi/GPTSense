      Hey y'all. I am so sick of studying. My test is on tuesday and I don't know if I can take much more cellular metabolism. You're probably thinking, " man, if Doug is freaking out over the third test of med school, he's in for a long hard haul." However, most people say that this test is probably the hardest of year 1, so that makes me feel a little bit better. God dammit, I'm tired.  ["Slow Like Honey," Fiona Apple, 1996]  This last friday night I went to a Rangers game with my folks. I don't think I have ever been to a Rangers game where they've actually won, and last friday night was no exception. They were doing well up until the 8th inning when everything just went to shit for the Rangers. I won't get into details, but it was so bad that at one point after a really screwed up play the home audience started booing the Rangers! Yeah, not too good. Anyway, it was still fun 'cause my mom got to walk out on the field and be honored with several other school teachers in the region who had been nominated for teacher-of-the-year. ["The Note," Doug Supernaw, 1995]  In Texas we're getting ready to vote on a number of state constitutional amendments, including proposition 12 which motions to put caps on the amount of non-economic damages that courts can give to victims of medical malpractice. There's a lot behind this issue, but needless to say I'm for it. Malpractice premiums have skyrocketed in recent years to the point that many doctors are closing their doors and moving elsewhere. And it's not like every doctor is getting sued. Only a few get sued, but courts have been awarding plaintiffs with millions of dollars in compensation that is for "pain and suffering" which does not include wage losses. Rural doctors and emergency medical physicians are particularly effected hard (which sucks, 'cause I plan to be both). Anyway, this is my plug for prop 12. Go vote! (Not that any of you who real this are in Texas, but whatever). ["Green River," Creedence Clearwater Revival, 1976]  Have a great Labor Day, everyone.

      I have been studying my butt off for this cell science test coming up. It's September 2nd, so wish me luck. ["I Wish It Would Rain Down," Phil Collins, 1989]  If I write with less frequency over the next week, that's why.  I did take a little time out to talk with some non-med student friends. Ashley Colburn is now all moved in at Temple in Philadelphia ready to start the physical therapy program. Laurie Glenn, err.....Laurie Biffer and I have now known each other for 15 years (since 2nd grade). We spent a while reminiscing about the good ol' days at Krum. The crowd that we both ran around with is now sooo dispersed that I'm not sure if we'll ever be toghether in one place again. ["I'll Be Around," Joan Osborne, 2002]  "The Big Chill" is a really good movie about a circle of old friends, for years seperated, that find each other again after the death of one of the friends. I hope to find a lot of these people again, especially since my 5 year HS reunion is something like 9 months away. [ "Vasoline," Stone Temple Pilots, 1994]    One of my newer friends here in Fort Worth, AnnMarie, was in a few of my public health classes this summer. We get along really well, for she is a former paramedic and we like to swap EMS stories. Well, over the summer her father died and that was a big burden for her. Long story short, I found out that her mother died just a few weeks ago, so in a period of 2 months she has lost both of her parents. I can't even imagine what she's going through; that's really scarey. ["City of New Orleans," Arlo Guthrie]  Since I've come back home I can tell that my relationship with my folks is much improved. Prior to Duke is was very strained, but now it's wonderful. I can't, and don't want to, imagine losing them at my age. If I were a religious person I would be praying for AnnMarie, but I'll be thinking about her while she takes the semester off.   Recommended song: "Pets" , Porno for Pyros, 1993.

      It's been a pretty relaxing weekend. I went to see "Open Range" with some friends yesterday and it was a real good movie. The thing that was best about it was the character development. So many movies today just sluff off character development as a waste of time, but this movie (and many Westerns in general) showcased character development as its heart and soul. Of course the cinematography was awesome. I highly recommend this movie.  ["Datura," Tori Amos, 1999]    I'm going to call Jake Woods sometime today and talk with him. I was really hoping that I would have had time this summer to go see him in Wisconsin, but that just didn't work out. I'm thinking about the possibility of a few days during spring break of next year, but I'm not sure yet. He was asking me a while back if I've really gotten involved with any organizations here at the medical school and while I've looked into a whole lot of groups I can't say that I've invested heavily into any. Med school is just very different from undergrad. Since I'm a med student and also in the school of public health, my time is more strained than most other students, not in a bad way. I so far enjoy the program that I'm in, but I'm going to be way more cautious about what I dedicate myself to outside of the classroom. Besides, it took a year of bouncing around at Duke before I found the EMT option, so I'm in no rush to committ.  ["Ode to a Butterfly," Nickel Creek, 2000]  Have a good sunday, everyone.

      I was talking with a good friend of mine today who told me how really lame it was to have a web log. "Why? What are you talking about?" I asked. ["5 & 1/2 Minute Hallway," Poe, 2000]  He said that blogs are really pointless and that if anyone really wanted to know how someone was doing he or she would write/call or whatever. Perhaps he's right. Maybe this whole attempt is really just a waste of time. I'll have to think about this whole thing some more before making a definite decision. ["Waste," Staind, 2001]  White Coat Ceremony was really cool. Afterwards my folks and I went out to eat at Joe T. Garcia's and the fajitas were aaaawesome! Jake Woods called me also, and though I didn't have time to really talk at length today we're hoping to catch up on sunday. Popo (paternal grandpa) will be in town tomorrow. This next week I'll have a lot more free time since they really worked us hard these first 3 weeks, but most of that free time will be spent studying. Studying is fine, but this new material is really tough. I haven't had biochemistry before and in some ways I wish I had taken it my last semester at Duke, but I took easier classes instead and mostly I'm glad that I gave myself a break.

      A few weeks ago I signed up for this running club. For those of you who don't know, I love running. I wouldn't call it fun per se, but it's similar to meditating in that it really makes you feel good after you're done. I've been getting back into my running routine these past few months and I think I may have lost some weight. I've never been a part of a running club, but I think I'd like to try to take part in some local running events. ["Mayberry," Rascal Flatts, 2002]  I've never run more than 6 miles at a time, which is almost 10km I think, but I can currently do two miles in 15 minutes, not speedy but decent for me I think.  Ok, I think this 10 commandments in the courthouse thing is getting a bit out of hand. The same sort of thing happened 4 years ago in South Carolina with the Confederate flag controversy. ["Brain Stew," Green Day, 1995] Just because one single judge wants his favorite statue in a federal building doesn't mean he can dismiss the seperation between church and state. However, people too quickly forget that one year ago we were all bitching about the "under God" part in the pledge of allegience. How can one justify keeping the ten commandments sculpture and yet keeping the pledge of allegiance untouched? ["The Cinema Show," Genesis, 1973]  I have a lot of opinions on this, but basically I know that the founding of our country was intertwined tightly with religion and that the two, though now seperate, have a common heritage. Rejecting this fact is rejecting history, which is just goddamn foolish. We shouldn't have to get rid of all religious icons in politics, but we should be aware of  how  these things are being presented (without alternative religions displayed, without appropriate plaques describing the historical significance, etc). Whatever, Alabama's whack.  I'm finding that a sense of community will probably be really strong here at TCOM. ["The Power of Goodbye," Madonna, 1998]  Our class of about 120 people will surely become a really closely knit group. With White Coat ceremony approaching I think we all realize that we're all in this together. Some of it may be that we're a much more mature group (average age 25). I remember feeling the same kind of comaraderie when I was at TAMS ('97-'99), but I never felt that same bond at Duke, maybe between me and certain other individuals, but never as a part of a group. ["Sweet Afton," Nickel Creek, 2002]  I guess I can't really say that. I remember living in the Arts Dorm and most of us in there really supported each other in a very sincere way. This was an exception. Duke was a wonderful place, but I will not be remembering it for its sense of community. ["Putting the Damage On," Tori Amos, 1996]  I really look forward to the possibilities here in this new place.   My apartment is a wreck and I've got to clean it and study more cell crap. Later.

      Today was a pretty good day I think. It's cool when people say happy birthday. It makes you feel like you're really part of the community. I didn't really do anything special today other than play ping pong for half-an-hour and allow myself to watch at episode of "Enterprise" that I hadn't seen. ["Riot Poof," Tori Amos, 1999]  Oh, there was this former graduate of TCOM that came today to the emergency medicine club meeting to talk about his tactical EMS department in St. George, Missouri. He's a class of '91 guy, but he's a medical director for the medical division of SWAT up there. He gave a very very interesting talk. For quite a while now I've fancied the idea of being an EMS medical director, though I don't really think I'd like being shot at. ["Time Stands Still," The All-American Rejects, 2003]  Since I'm more into public health and health policy issues I imagine that I'd really like to delve into rural prehospital care research when I'm not working in the ED setting. There's just so much goddamn untapped potential in this area. It won't make me any quick money, but it'll make me happy.  ["Till Death Do Us Part," Madonna, 1989]    The UNTHSC White Coat Ceremony is this weekend and I'm really looking forward to it. This is basically a med school ceremony where each entering student is cloaked with the white coat which symbolizes their new committment to medicine and health science. I'm also going to go see "Open Range" this weekend; I'm a very big fan of westerns. ["Southern Man," Neil Young]  That's about all that I can think of. I'm now going to continue studying my patient interviewing rubric and the hellish world of cellular glycolysis. When you thought you had it beat for the MCAT, it returns with a vengence.

      Tuesday, August 19, 2003       Ok, so to spice things up a bit I guess I'll talk a little bit about my non-existant love life. ["Anytime You Need a Friend,"  Mariah Carey] I guess in college my wild and crazy days were my freshman and sophomore years. I was dating someone all the time then, even at one point my own RA, but once I became an RA that came to an abrupt halt. I don't know what to think about med school, i mean I can't imagine that meeting people is going to be that much easier here. ["Judy Blue Eyes," Crosby, Stills, & Nash]  I also have this problem of "leading girls on" when I'm not interested. I'm not sure why this happens, but it's a definite problem I have. I've had several girls try to kill me because of this uncontrollable behavior. I've thought about this a lot and I think that it's because I'm a lot like my dad. My mom pretty much runs the household; my dad has worked hard all his life but pretty much supports my mom on whatever she thinks is best. ["Precious Things," Tori Amos]  My dad, according to my mom, was and is a very quiet man. He was introduced to my mother by a mutual friend back in the '70s. I'm really lucky that they have such a strong marriage, but I have a feeling that my dad, twenty-three years ago, was generally fearful of women much like I think I am. That's right, I said it. I think I'm afraid of women. My self confidence just isn't worth shit and I would much rather do my own thing rather than take a chance on talking to girl who I might want to get to know. In fact, I don't think that I've ever "made the move" myself on asking someone out on a date (not including to lame dances and whatnot). Very fucking sad for a 23 year old. Ok, I'm not helping matters, so shut up. Perhaps I unconsciously lead some girls on in some sort of ego boost thing. Yeah, I'm really messed up. Did I tell you that I'm an only child?       Ok, so about half of my medical school class is married. How much does that blow? I go from Duke, which is hook-up central, to a Ft. Worth, Texas medical program which is the matrimony capital of the state. Go figure. So yeah, anytime I meet anyone who I think might be cool to get to know, D'OH! they're married. ["You're So Vain," Carly Simon]  Arg, I gotta stop talking about this. It's gonna be my birthday, I don't want to be pissed.       I'm probably done for the night. I don't know how often I'll be able to keep this blog up, but it might be cool to do a little bit every few days. I promise, all subsequent blogs will be shorter and more succinct. ["Spit on a Stranger," Nickel Creek] Take care!

           I really don't know what I would do without internet radio. I always have it going on in my apartment. It's amazing really; I can listen to any kind of music I want to at any time. [Currently I'm listening to "Trying" by Lifehouse]. I had no idea that I would like this song so much, but the computer program anticipated what kind of music I might like based on the prior music ratings that I've given it over the last 3 months. It's almost like some sort of symbiotic relationship between the internet and me: I get great music and the internet learns how I enjoy my music (along with millions of others) so that it can make more money. Sounds like a good deal to me!      I talked with my mother earlier in the day and she gave me the whole "23 years ago I was pregnant and it was hotter than hell" story. For those of you who don't know, the summer of 1980 was one of the hottest summers on record and it wasn't a great time to be pregnant. [Currently listening to "Storms" by Fleetwood Mac]   You know, it's funny what we chose to remember. I can't remember most of my birthdays, but I do remember my 5th, 10th, 17th, and 19th birthdays. There was something about them that just stuck with me. My fifth birthday was my FIREMAN-themed birthday party. It was awesome and I had lots of friends there. For my tenth birthday I went on a bike outing at a nearby state park. At 17 my friends at Krum, Texas threw me a surprise party, which was really special since I was leaving Krum and heading to TAMS (Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science).  ["But I Do Love You" by LeAnn Rimes]  At 19 I just got royally trashed with some friends the summer between high school graduation and college. Memory is quite a powerful force, but selective as all hell. If you don't believe me, just ask Marcel Proust.       I got a birthday card from one of my best friends from Duke, Ashley Colburn, yesterday and it had a lot of pictures included. ["Live To Tell", Madonna]  These pictures were like a blast from the past. Graduation, RA awards ceremony, Myrtle Beach, random crap, etc. In many ways the scenes from 3-and-a-half months ago seemed like days, yet years ago. It's just amazing to me how all of us at Duke lived furiously, one moment to the next, not looking back and rarely looking ahead, yet in an instant it all was over. It was sad, amazing, beautiful, and all too real. ["Thank U", Alanis Morissette]  Alanis really is an amazing singer. I really like her song "Precious Illusions" also. Some of the Duke EMS emails have started up again. I look back at the three years I spent with that group as some of the most awesome years of my life; I learned more from my experience there (truthfully) than most of my classes at Duke. ["Cant Stop Loving You", Phil Collins]  Ok, this song sucks. Phil Collins songs have just gone completely sucky since about 1995 or so. His songs are now all addressed to his kids and crap, which kinda sucks for us people who loved his '80s, early 90's stuff.

           Welcome! My name is Douglas Wayne Segars and I am yet another "blogger" that is just starting up. I really don't expect to keep up this habit, but who knows, maybe it'll stick. I kept a journal for about 3 years until I was 20, at which point I became a psycho pre-med f*ck-up and stopped putting my thoughts in writing. Now I'm a f*cked-up first-year medical student in a whole new city, with a whole new set of peers and a whole new set of issues.       Tomorrow is my 23rd birthday. I think it's Blink-182 that said "nobody loves you when you're 23," so I'm not expecting much. However, maybe this blog can help capture in words some of the huge changes that I've been through in the last 4 months, not to mention my new med school experiences. Ok, this'll do for an intro. Have fun reading, though I can't promise that it'll be spellbinding material. I lead a pretty low key life most of the time. Later.

      This weekend was really awesome. It's probably been the best weekend since the July 4th weekend. On Friday night I had a small party at my apartment with about 6 people and we had a lot of fun. We were all really tame though. On Saturday I went to the Fort Worth Jazz Festival with 2 other people. On saturday evening I drove up to Denton where our family got together to celebrate Papa's 80th birthday. We had the party at my cousin David's restaurant at Valley View where I ended up having a very good grilled chicken salad for dinner! Pictures available at    http://f1.pg.briefcase.yahoo.com/dsegars@sbcglobal.net ["Take Me Home," Phil Collins, 1985]  At first glance it seems like everything is just peachy with my family, and honestly I consider myself lucky to have such a good one. However, there's a lot of stuff going on with my mom's side. I don't really want to get into the nuances of our extended family relations, but it's enough to really stress Mom at times. Being away for four years was great, but I'm glad that I'm able to help her out now that I'm closer. It's odd 'cause I always try to live with the idea that any relationship can be repaired, however times like these really make me see how some people cannot help but grow apart over the years, even if they're sisters.  ["You and Me," Tom Petty, 2002]  This week I will be applying to become a member of the Tarrant County Medical Society. For some reason I have an interest in the "public grievance committee." I have no idea what it does, but I'm hoping to find out soon. Gosh, it would suck ass to be put on a committee that really blew. I need to talk to some people about it.  ["Reasons Why," Nickel Creek, 2000]  In the last week I've talked briefly with a number of my friends from Duke EMS, including Steve Barmach, Jake Woods, and Jen Farrell. I don't have a lot of time to talk usually, but occasionally I do, and when I do I really like keeping in touch with them. It seems to me that the squad's been going through a turbulent month. Those kinds of times really bring out the best and the worst in an organization. I'll be seeing Steve the second week in October, so we'll have plenty of time to chat about stuff.  ["Suite: Judy Blue Eyes," Crosby, Stills, and Nash, 1969]  Gotta sleep now. Gross anatomy starts for me this week!

      That excellent weekend that I was talking about earlier (see september 13th), well it's finally here! I'm done with my cellular science section of medical school and my first round of practical exams. I think it went well for the most part. Gross anatomy and musculoskeletal science starts next week. ["Go Your Own Way," Fleetwood Mac, 1977]  What am I going to do with my 3-day weekend? Tomorrow I am planning on watching the 10th anniversary show of Conan O'Brian and probably some movie also with Melanie, Omar, and perhaps Juls. Saturday I'm going to the Fort Worth jazz festival and that evening I'll be going home to celebrate my grandpa's 80th birthday. Papa is now among those people whom public health professionals call among the "oldest-old". He's still doing pretty well healthwise. ["I Drove All Night," Celine Dion, 2003]  Kelli Modlin, one of my friends here at UNTHSC was in a car accident this afternoon. I think she'll be ok, but her car was pretty totaled. Melanie, Juls, Omar and I went to see her in the ER this afternoon. I got to talking to Melanie afterward about how odd this day was. First the weather was f*cked up royally today (alternating sunny and rainy patterns all through the day). Second....well I don't know how else the day was f*cked, but it just was, I'm not here to figure it out. Maybe Isabel pulled some air pressure shit on us here in Texas. Anyway, I get so pissed and uptight about stupid crap all the time. Seeing Kelli in the hospital today really reinforced to me that I'm really wrapped up in unimportant crap.  ["Who'll Stop the Rain," Credence Clearwater Revival, 1976]  Ok, so now for more unimportant crap. It's now been 2 years and 2 months since I've dated anyone. I've gotta start looking in the public health school or the nursing school. This is rediculous, the best years of my prime are just going to waste. I'm just sick of this crap...what's it going to take for me to get out there again and take a chance? Well, I'm tired now, so I'll see y'all later.

      Hey y'all. I'm still alive and doing all right. This weekend is no fun but next weekend should be EXCELLENT. By then I'll be done with cell science and ready to move on to musculoskeletal. I'm not going to say too much tonight just 'cause I don't really have much to talk about.  ["Don't Go Away," Oasis, 1997] Today was the proposition 12 day here in Texas. I talked about it a few weeks ago; it's a tort reform constitutional amendment that is supposed to help control skyrocketing malpractice insurance costs. We should know soon whether the amendment has passed and concurrently how many decades it'll take me to pay off my debts! Ah, no worries though, I'm not in it for the money, but I would like to actually start a family before I'm 40, so that's why I'm concerned. ["Juarez," Tori Amos, 1999] Aight y'all, take care.

      What am I doing writing in this thing when I've got class in 7 hours? I'm going to be brief. I had a really nice weekend. The weather this past week has been unusually cool and pleasant. I got to be with my dad on his birthday and I also got to have lunch with 3 old friends from my first high school whom I had not seen in about 4 years.  ["Tequila Sunrise," Eagles, 1976] It's just amazing to me that despite how much we've all changed we all continued to act around each other the way we did at Krum, horsing around, making fun of each other, and having a great time. ["Pink Moon," Nick Drake, 1994] Will McKnight is actually living in Fort Worth now. He recently bought a house and is now working at Lockheed Martin. I was really glad to hear that he is living so close, I had no idea before this weekend. Krista Wright.....er...Roseland is living in Killeen and is anxiously awaiting her husband's return from Iraq. She is working in the speech therapy program at an elementary school. Krista was the one who gave me my first bit of motivation to apply to TAMS, something that literally changed my life for the better. Nicolle Bowling is engaged I think and is working in accounting/marketing for the Farmers & Merchants State Bank in Denton. She is full of so much energy. Her and Krista are really the life of the party while Will and I just kinda look at each other and shake our heads in laughter as we watch the hilarity unfold before us.  ["Harvest," Neil Young, 1972] Another test this wednesday, so I'd better be going. September 11th is coming up again. Where were you when you heard the news? I was coming out of physics class at Duke returning a page I had gotten from my dad. My dad never usually pages me during the day, so I knew something wasn't right. He told me on the phone what had happened and I quickly joined the hundreds of shocked students in the Bryan Center as we looked at the tv screens in disbelief.

      Those two Mars rovers, the  Spirit  and  Opportunity  are awesome. I'm hooked to those two robots just like I'm hooked to ER and Enterprise. I mean think about it; those pictures that they've sent back are from a completely different planet millions of miles away! How the hell did they figure out how to do that? Plus I'm just so God-damned tired of the election year news: it's Dean....no, it's Kerry....no, it's Bush....no, it's whoever's got the jobs.  Spirit  and  Opportunity  are both out on the frontier of space exploration where one day man will hopefully live and have a chance to begin again.  Many people argue that we should be spending money to take care of our own first rather than trying to make it to Mars. My mother and I were talking about this the other day and that is exactly how she feels. While I really don't logical rebuttal to that, I just hope that my generation will accomplish something more than getting everybody health insurance, saving Social Security or whatever government program you want to think of. I don't want my generation to be known as the ones that had to clean up after and change the bed-pans of the baby-boom generation. If we have the ability to get out there into space then we should. There will always be shit to take care of here on earth. That will never change, but that shouldn't ever keep us from looking toward new frontiers.   This weekend was pretty good. I didn't really do anything special but watch some taped TV with a friend and study. I finally booked some tickets for Duke for spring break, so I'll get to go back and see my NC friends one last time. It'll be good and kinda weird all at the same time. Ok, I'm off to bed. Have a good monday.   Songs of the day: The Flaming Lips,  Fight Test , 2003. Train,  Calling All Angels , 2003. Radiohead,  Creep , 1993.

      Let me start tonight by reaffirming that I hate my damn computer sometimes. Oh yeah, now everything's fine, but just 5 minutes ago I was close to beating the screen in. There's no telling how many great blogger submissions this computer has taken to the graveyard. Somehow it senses when I'm at my most vulnerable and it freezes up the file I'm working on. Dammit I hate losing what I've worked for.  I don't even know how to begin again anymore. Where do I start? I'll start again tomorrow....I'm going to bed.

           While I was at Duke I never watched TV. Three out of my four years there I didn't even have a TV in my room. One would think that in med school I wouldn't have time to watch TV; think again. I probably shouldn't be watching TV as much as I am, but I do. I mostly tape shows though and watch them on my own time with friends.       ER is one that I've started watching in the past year. Yeah, it's been on for 10 seasons and I never really payed much attention to it until recently. I think I just like the characters more nowadays. I actually think I have a thing for Maura Tierney, the actress that plays Abby Lockheart. Her character is a nurse who's a 4th year medical student. She's had a whole lot of shit happen to her in the past few years so she's an underdog of sorts. I'm really not sure why I think she's so attractive. Maybe it's because she's somewhat introverted like myself, I'm not sure. Her character has been getting a lot of good episodes lately.      That show does sort of freak me out though. I know ER is fiction, but geez...am I supposed to be able to do all that stuff once I'm in my rotations in a couple years? My first board exams will be June of 2005 which means I'll start studying for those in a year! All this stuff is going way too fast.

      Wow, it's been almost 4 months since I've posted to this thing. What the hell have I been up to? So much has happened, it's all gone by so fast. Right now though I am preparing for my second cardiopulmonary exam on monday. I am pretty mentally exhausted. I get about 5 hours of sleep each night, but tomorrow I am done by 4pm so I'm gonna crash early. Today has not been a great day. It hasn't been bad, just not great either. I'm pretty sure that I flunked my clinical medicine quiz today and I am probably going to have to see a doctor about a minor lateral scoliosis in my back. Oh yeah, my rent is going up too by almost 10% starting in March. Getting away from this recent shit, it looks like we're going to Mars according to Bush. If we get to Mars by 2020 I'll be 40 years old. That will be so freakin' awesome. Hell, I wanna be an astrodoctor or something.

      I've recently posted a few photos on the following website:  urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/dsegars@sbcglobal.net  My week off is just about over. I start back to classes on Monday, but I'm really glad I had this chance to refresh and catch up with myself. I've already mentioned how it snowed on Valentine's day. That was really cool. On Monday I had my public health class; nothing special there. Tuesday was pretty cool also. I got to work during the day for a home health service called Amedisys. Home health care is a service provided by Medicare part A, so being the health policy student that I am I had a great  time learning how home health works in Fort Worth. There's actually a lot of politics and economics that goes into home health care, which makes it that much more interesting.  Tuesday night I had about 5 people over to my apartment for dinner. I really spent way to much money on dinner for everyone; basically about a week's worth of food for myself was spent in one evening. I can't be doing that kind of thing often. It's time to tighten the belt a little.  About a month ago I learned that my Duke sophomore-year roommate, Alan Billharz, was going to be in Austin, Texas for a few days on business. On Wednesday I drove down to Austin to meet with him and three of his Microsoft coworkers. I had a really good time there. I got to stay with them at the Driskill Hotel (quite nice), I got to have a really good rizotto verde at this one Italian place, and we got to listen to a really good local band on Austin's 6th Street. I only really got to hang out with Alan for a handful of hours, but I'm very glad I made the trip down. We got to catch up on lots of things; I really hope that I get the chance to get up to Seattle sometime.  Thursday I went back home, and Friday I got my eyes checked and talked to Jake Woods for a few hours. Today was a beautiful day to go running...and that just about brings me to right now.  I've got about 3 weeks before I return to Duke for a few days. I think while I'm there I want to try to do a lot of things that I never really got a chance to do: I want to revisit the Duke Gardens, lay out on the main quad and read the Chronicle, run along the Washington Duke trail and completely listen to my old friends without having a timetable running through my head. Those should be some good days.

      I'm in the middle of a much needed break. Having just finished my cardiopulmonary section I have about a week of very basic academic and out-of-class work to take care of. On friday the 13th I went home to Denton to try to beat the winter weather. Early saturday morning my mother woke me up after it started to snow and I leaped from bed acting like a kid in grade school. The snow was all over the place, so with my camera in hand I went to photograph this extremely rare event. The pictures are posted at the following site:  http://photos.yahoo.com/dsegars@sbcglobal.net

      Tomorrow night is gonna be fun. For starters I'm going to Hooters for a birthday party. While I'm there I'll be watching the Duke-UNC game!!! Yep, and I've even managed to get some of my med school friends interested in the game. It's going to be a good one.  It's been a rainy day today, and rainy days seem to make for reflective days. You know, the kind where you do more thinking than usual. Today I've been working on a clinical medicine assignment that's required a little right brain thinking. It's called a "spiritual history." It's just a quick statement that I thought I'd add on to this blog. It's kinda deep though, so be careful reading it.   Faith & Practice I am not a religious person. I don’t follow any faith though my family is Christian. However I do believe that there is a reason for everything that happens in this world and that there is an order at work that we don’t completely understand. There are two somewhat spiritual practices that I follow through the best and worst of times, namely meditation and writing.  My meditation practice simply involves finding a calm place and clearing my mind with varying breathing exercises and postures. It is difficult to articulate exactly how meditation works for me, but I can say that it calms and centers me in a way that allows me to confront life’s daily problems with a joy and clarity that I would not have otherwise. Writing, on the other hand, is my way of remembering important life experiences. My life is a collection of events and situations that have some meaning, and since my memory is so poor one of the best ways I learn and grow spiritually is to document meaningful experiences and reflect on them.   Importance Our society is extremely forward-looking, prospective, and it never looks back. Our days are mapped out in hourly schedules and even those individual hours are sectioned by successive powerpoint slides. Meditation and writing are both my ways of breaking out of this seemingly endless pattern. One of the primary goals of meditation is to take one’s conscious thought away from a timetable so that one may simply enjoy being in the present. Bringing myself back to the present moment free of all other external and internal influences is invaluable. I consider writing, however, to be my retrospective practice. It allows me to look backwards in time on my life experiences and give them some kind of meaning, great or small. Both of these practices help me appreciate my past and present as my foundation.

      I'm just about ready to kill me a cat. I've got a particular one in mind. After I got home from class today I caught a cat chewing on one of my ferns. It bit a whole branch of one off and then acted all territorial when I chased it off. Yep, that mangy cat is goin' down! Seriously, I don't take kindly to animals that just chew stuff for no reason. I mean it's not like cats usually eat plants or anything. If I were to just randomly put a dead carcass out on my patio, well then I'd expect some cats to come snooping around, but plants? What the hell?! I wonder if cats are afraid of owls. I could find one of those decoy owls to stick on my patio; maybe that would keep the cat away. I'm not too sure about wheather owls would scare 'em. If anybody knows please email me. However, I'm pretty sure that cats are afraid of getting shot in the ass with a BB gun, but I don't think my neighbors would take to kindly to me shooting my gun around dinnertime. I'm just going to have to poison the SOB.   Songs of the day  Toto,  Africa , 1982.  Badly Drawn Boy,  Silent Sigh , 2002.

      Ok, I gotta make this quick, ‘cause I want to sleep. Stuff is going well; renal physiology is slowly catching on in my mind. Did you know that the kidneys are 1/200th of our body weight, yet they receive 25% of our overall cardiac output?  Today I got to talk with two old friends of mine. Will McKnight, a friend of mine from Krum, left a message on my phone yesterday and I got back with him today. I’ve known for quite some time that he has a house now in Fort Worth ever since he started work at Lockheed Martin, but I have just completely neglected to keep in touch with him. I called him back today and I think we might be watching some basketball, TV, etc. this weekend. I’ve been saying now for months that I need to hang around with non-medical students sometimes for my own sanity, yet I’ve somehow forgotten about a handful of people I know in Fort Worth, including Will and my cousin, Jeff.    I also heard from one of my old HS roommates, Jacob Schofield. He’s now in flight school at Corpus Christi and today he sent me some pictures he recently took of him flying. I can’t even fathom it, but Jacob is really going to be a pilot. I guess he’s already somewhat of a pilot if he’s flying certain planes around! Jacob is from Ponder, so he’s one of those TAMS people that I’m pretty sure I’ll be able to keep tabs on over the years.   That’s it. Have a good night.

      Today has been one great day for college basketball. I think I've watched about five games today and now I'm watching UNC get snuffed by Texas. Tomorrow I have to return to med school mode so tonight is my last smell of freedom.   Today has been a big day of changes. My folks and I moved a 6-foot tall bookshelf into my apartment. I also cleaned out my dirty refrigerator and moved all my plants outside to my patio. I have quite a few large plants that have been in my room for most of winter, but not anymore. The biggest change was that I finally shaved. The great facial hair experiment of 2004 has concluded. It seems that most people don't like it, especially women. And even more so, I think that most of those who said it looked nice were just trying to be nice to me. After having shaved I barely recognized my own face. My chin seemed so small.  Anyway, it's gone now.  My parents, Papa, and I were on our way to the Golden Corral (Papa's favorite restaurant) yesterday when Papa asked me about the kinds of sports I like to play. I told him that I like running, volleyball, tennis, basketball and such. Papa, out of nowhere, starts laughing. He begins to tell a joke about something that Grandma Monie said probably about 70 years ago. See there were these two little girls arguing about what game to play. They went on and on until Grandma Monie told them to hush up and suggested that they both play "dog". Confused, the girls asked how you play "dog." Grandma replied "you come sniff my butt and I'll growl." Yeah, it's not exactly a joke; it's more rediculous than anything else, but it was funny as hell to Papa. After a few seconds his laughter became contagious and we all couldn't help but let out a quick giggle.

      	I woke up at around 10 a.m., took a shower, and packed up all my crap. At 11 a.m. I said my goodbyes to Shaomeng and headed to the Armadillo Grill where I meet with Dahl Clark one last time. She is looking forward to her future in physics research and starting her own lab equipment business. When she was talking with me I remember at one time she commented on how I seemed to have lots of friends. I was really baffled by this, for I don’t think of myself this way at all. It’s all in the eye of the beholder. Her comment gets me thinking quite a bit. Will I ever just be happy with the way I am? 	Less than two hours before I was scheduled to leave campus I met with Jen Farrell at the Loop. She immediately expresses her disapproval of my facial hair. I tell her that she’s not alone, for just about every girl I meet has said the same thing. Jen is doing well and has recently returned from a WHO conference in South Africa. She and I share a common interest in public health and health policy, though she is more interested in international health issues while I am more drawn to regional Texas health issues. Children’s health and development is important to her, while insurance coverage and obesity are my big issues. Finally we talked about her forced resignation from the squad back in the fall. I still can’t believe that things happened to her the way they did. It’s incredibly unfortunate. She has a visceral dislike for Steve and the others involved with squad leadership. She said at one point that she felt like she was crying out for help so many times only to find that no one was listening. I can’t imagine her anger, though now it’s turned into a quiet frustration. I tried to let her know that she is tied in with the photographs and memories of so many people already graduated and we all think of Jen and DUEMS completely different from the way that she or Steve sees her involvement with DUEMS. She seemed to appreciate that sentiment. Seriously, before this year she was on the squad for 3 years. She and I joined the squad at the same time, yet our finale experiences couldn’t have been different! Jen is going places though. She’s going to be a serious asset to public health wherever she is and I hope to keep in touch with her over the years.  	I talked with Jen for nearly two hours and realized I had 10 minutes to buy my friend a t-shirt, get money from the ATM, and then get my luggage and meet Steve at the bus stop? Was it possible? Could Doug do it all in time? Well, not really, I was about five minutes late getting to the bus stop, but mainly because I ran into Lexie Riofrio and Matt McDaniel in the Bryan Center and Brandon Jones while in the EMS office. I wish I had longer to talk to all those people, but alas, no. As I was getting ready to leave, I heard a call go out! It was the first one I’d heard all week. Some person was disoriented after having been stuck in an elevator. It was a thrill just listening to the tones and dispatch once again.  	Steve volunteered to take me to the airport and we had a nice chat on the way over. Steve’s a very quiet guy, so he didn’t say much. We said our goodbyes at terminal C and I headed on my way. The best part of my vacation was over. It was time for me to leave and return to Texas. I was kinda sad at that moment. I mean, I really enjoyed being a Dukie once again. It was a strange combination of being welcome, yet out-of-place at the same time. On the plane I had to deal with this sadness and loneliness all over again. It was really the same feeling I felt on my graduation day a year ago. The plane started higher and higher until it finally broke through the rainy clouds. For the first time all week I saw blue, sunny skies stretching everyway. It was beautiful. This is corny, I know, but I believe that everything happens for a reason. At that time on the plane I thought about how lucky I was to have an opportunity to see so many college friends once again. How lucky am I also that I will probably keep touch with a few of them for quite a number of years?  	I’m now back home in Northern Texas and I wonder how I can bring that college passion to my life in Fort Worth. The city is great, there are nice people here and plenty of opportunities, but something keeps me closed in, detached from my world. What kind of bullshit is going on in my head? People are getting killed every day in Afghanistan and Iraq, 43 million people in this country are without health insurance, and millions of hypocrits in this country want to deny equal rights to gay individuals just because of religious fanaticism and/or bigotry. There is no excuse for my apathy. Unless I want to end up like Dostoevsky’s Underground Man, I have got to push myself beyond my comfort zone. It’s time for me to move on.

      	I wake up in the freezing cold and peer out the window. It’s not raining, but it ain’t sunny. I take the bus from east to west campus so that I can go visit Angie one more time and get a picture. Angie and I chat one last time and we take a quick picture. I’m very glad that I was able to have a courteous farewell picture with her. During the week of graduation last year so much was going on that I neglected to say goodbye to Angie. I noticed that one of my earlier pictures was on her wall, which made me glad. Angie kept all sorts of photos of students she knew over the years.  	My mom made some brownies before I left home. I brought them with me to NC and this morning I finished the big one that I brought. They were really good brownies; I brought them from home knowing that I really didn’t want to be spending money on expensive Duke snacks while I was there.  	As I’m working on the ICS presentation for the squad meeting I get a call from Kim, which means that it’s time for me to head over to east campus to meet her for lunch. We meet in front of the West Duke Building on East Campus, which is where we would always meet at the EMT-Basic class for 2 ½ years. We head over to George’s Garage, which was really good. We spend most of the time talking about Kim’s competitive cooking. Her boyfriend and her got started cooking as a couple and have had some recent success. I don’t know that I exactly understand how competitive cooking really works, but she loves it. You know, it’s all about passion. You have to find something you’re passionate about and then go with it. Before we leave we briefly talk about how the squad’s relationship with the EMT class has gone downhill. The squad leadership seems to have this “my way or the highway” mentality that really frustrates Kim and Barbara. I tell her that I’m really full of regret about not leaving the EMT class more settled than it is. Months prior to my graduation I could tell that no one cared about the EMT class as much as I did. She assures me that it wasn’t my fault and that these kinds of phases come and go. The current squad leadership will eventually graduate and others will take charge. I let Kim know that Omaira will be the new training officer and we both hope that she does a better job of working with the system instead of working against it. Change is a gradual process that takes persistent, patient effort. The current squad leadership attempted to push through immediate, instantaneous change and it only created a rift between themselves and the class.  	Sue-Ellen, Dyson, Sunny Wang and I all made arrangements to have dinner this evening. We end up going to Rick’s Diner, which was where I must have eaten 25% of the time when I was a senior. Sunny is still Sunny, very funny and upbeat, but we are both able to commiserate about first-year troubles. Sunny is a first-year at Duke Med and she apparently is dating somebody she met while she worked at a firestation for two years prior to entering med school. I am real happy for her; I realize how much I’ve got to get out and experience new things, see new people. We also talk about trying to find Dyson a job. Sue-Ellen ends up buying mine and Sunny’s dinner because somehow I forgot to bring my money (is this a recurring theme?) and Sunny’s medical school flex doesn’t work at Rick’s for some reason. I need to remember that I owe Sunny about five dollars. Sunny comes to see the first part of the squad meeting before she takes off, probably to go study somewhere.  	Once I get to the EMS meeting the first person I see is Matt Womble. Matt Womble is another very inspiring individual. Why didn’t I make an appointment to go see him this week? I know I thought about it, but I ended up thinking that he’d be too busy to meet. We talk only very briefly and I can tell that he’s starting to get some grey hairs. He is there to answer some initial questions about their MCI drill, which will happen next week. As he leaves he asks how long I will be in town; I tell him that I’m leaving tomorrow and I again I regret having not contacted him about my visit. What was I thinking? I will write him in the near future, for he’s done so much for the squad and me.  	This is going to sound really corny, but I loved giving the ICS presentation and walkthrough this evening. I absolutely love presenting material to people in new ways and then watching them rise to the challenges I present them with. The squad members seemed very attentive and asked good questions. The ICS walkthrough went better than expected. We took it outside and actually put an ICS in place for the triage, treatment, and transport of 15 written mock-patients. It was pretty cool how all I had to do was set the walkthrough up and get it started before it took on a life of its own. What’s amazing to me about ICS is how increasingly complex it can become in a matter of minutes. The amount of communication grows exponentially during that time. I fully believe that this group of EMTs will do fairly well on their drill. Roni Prucz asked quite a bit of questions; he must know that he’s most likely to be the I.C. for the drill. Dave Strauss and others told me afterwards that they were very pleased and pleasantly surprised about how the training went. Ah, how great that felt. I still got the touch, eh?  	This evening I’m staying with Shaomeng Wang. Shaomeng and I were both RA’s in Pegram my junior year. He’s very unlike myself, which is why I think we get along so well. Shaomeng is a “gangsta” who doesn’t like to take crap from nobody. However, he’s also very thoughtful and a loyal friend. He judges people based on their character rather than superficiality, that’s a very admirable trait, especially at Duke. I feel kinda bad about staying with him that evening because he’s got a project due the next day, but I get to talk with him here and there in passing. He’s overly concerned about how comfortable I am and so on and he goes overboard trying to be a good host to me. That was nice and very typical Shaomeng. He tells me about his girlfriend of about 7 months now. She’s a very nice-looking young woman from Singapore, so now we both have dated Singaporeans. He’s going to Chicago next year to start a business job with ambitions to start an MBA in a few years. Very cool. 	The day is winding down and I start feeling a little sad ‘cause tomorrow I will leave. These few days have flown by so fast and I really wasn’t able to complete everything I wanted to complete. I did get to see just about every person I wanted, so that’s a major plus. There’s really only one person left, the queen of busy, my old crew 1 member, and “my baby momma,” Jen Farrell.

                        I wake up to semi-rainy weather, which keeps me from going on the run that I want to take. I get ready for the day and suddenly realize that North Carolina is in the Eastern time zone and that I have been going by Central time. This means that I have 20 minutes to meet Molly (my NC State entomology friend) at Mad Hatters. Yeah, I came really close to screwing that up. Molly and I both show up at Hatters at about the same time. We talk about Duke basketball, dating (or my lack thereof), and old Arts Dorm members whom are married, engaged, whatever. After Hatters, we roam 9th street, which has a handful of very interesting shops and eateries. Molly is looking for a wind chime to give as a gift for a bridal shower. The Regulator Bookstore is the next place we visit. While browsing I get stuck in the self-help section while Molly is looking at children’s books. She finds an illustrated book on the life of Henry David Thoreau and the main character has been drawn as a bear. It was real funny. Franchesca’s was our last stop. It has much more space after having taken over the building space next door. Molly recommends to me some mint latte or something; somehow in the years that I’ve known Molly I never knew that we both liked mint. We spend at least an hour in there talking about movies, our respective academic stuff, and whatever else. It’s funny because we talked about so much, I can’t ever remember it later. I mainly just remember catching up and telling stories that made us both laugh. Oh…she and I have the same car. They’re exactly the same. After 3 hours, we go our separate ways again. She drops me off at the WEL and then continues on the road back to Raleigh.  	I then call Stephanie, my old resident coordinator (RA boss). We meet up in her new office, a huge improvement from her office last year. Her hair is now short and curly. Stephanie seems to still be happy with her job so she’ll be staying around for a third year next year. Students who live in selective houses and fraternities have been pretty upset with the Residence Life Office decision to do away with the annual review, but Stephanie’s view is that people are blowing things way out of proportion (some people claim that the university is trying to get rid of frats and selectives). Whatever. I tell Stephanie everything that I’ve heard from Michael Barham and Ashley Colburn, and we end our conversation laughing about the fact that there still is no furniture in the “dead-end alcove” on my hall. Go figure! 	In the EMS office Matt McDaniel and Michelle Hu are getting ready to do scenarios. I couldn’t resist the opportunity to be a patient again so I ended up simulating a chest pain patient first and a hyperventilating mother second. On that last one I actually hyperventilated so much my finger and facial muscles kept consistently contracted for a few minutes afterward. I was real glad about how much Matt and Michelle have progressed over the year. Being a crew chief and doing things like this for my crew members was just about the most fun part of Duke EMS.  	What is it with the Duke food? I come back to campus and quickly realize that I am unable to finish the meals I used to get all the time. The food point system there on campus seems to promote convenient eating, which means I must have eaten more then than I do now. This must be true ‘cause I’ve also had several people tell me that I look like I’ve lost weight.  	Matt catches me on the way to the bathroom and it’s evident that he’s anxious about something. I know through the grapevine that Matt has recently been demoted from crew chief. He’s actually had a pretty tough month and he seems to want some damage control advice; he’ll be assuming the I.C. role in two weeks and he’s beginning to feel a bit overwhelmed. We schedule a time to meet and I hope to help him in any way that I can.  	One of my favorite experiences was going with 7 Duke EMS members to the Durham County EMT-I class. They have the class on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays in the evenings. Fortunately, Kathy Mellown is the instructor. She’s a really good instructor who did one of our EMT-D classes about 2 years ago. The EMTs at the class (Steve Barmach, David Strauss, Jared Miranda, Steev Jones, Shelby Addison, Omaira Pacheco, and Mike Cheung) all had bruises from their previous class when they were practicing IV sticks. Tonight they learned about external jugular IV sticks and pharmacology. It wasn’t a very interactive class, but I pretty much got the idea. I really wish I would have had that kind of opportunity sometime while I was at Duke, but then again I’m in med school and I wouldn’t have had the chance to really use the EMT-I skills that I would have learned. What I thought was very good about the class was that Duke EMS was the most represented agency there and our members were able to network with several other people from different county agencies. I even got to meet with Josh Bordeaux who is an Orange County EMT. Josh (a UNC sophomore), Marcia, and I met probably about 2 years ago to talk about Josh’s goal of establishing a campus EMS squad at UNC. While things haven’t really panned out the way he’d hoped, he is active with Orange County EMS and seems to be happy there.  	Cosmic Cantina is a staple of the Duke student diet. You can get large amounts of food for very very cheap. I actually forgot to bring money with me to the EMT-I class so I figured that I wouldn’t be able to get any food with Dave Strauss and Steve Barmach. However, at Cosmic Cantina I was able to get a good- sized vegetarian taco for $2, which I payed for with spare change that I had in my wallet. You’ve got to love Cosmic. While I wouldn’t call it the “best Mexican food on the planet” like they always claim, it’s got to be one of the best deals on the planet. Oh, and it’s also the place where you’re most likely to get mugged in Durham. Fun stuff! 	David Strauss approached me earlier in the day about doing the incident command structure (ICS) training at Wednesday night’s meeting. How could I resist? This would be the third year in a row that I’ve done the training, and it’s really no burden ‘cause it’s a training that I love to do. I didn’t want the presentation to be “business-as-usual” though, so I needed to find a way to spice it up a bit. Before I went to bed I updated the powerpoints with a number of pictures from past MCI drills and I went about planning an outdoor activity for an MCI walkthrough. I loved having a training task ahead of me, for it gave me a focus and I began to get all wrapped up in it, just like I used to do.

           I got up at 4 a.m. this morning to get ready for the day. I left my apartment an hour later in order to beat the rush-hour traffic. As I arrived the airport was pretty quiet, but as the sunlight started to gleam through the windows of gate C15 the amount of activity blossomed. I twisted and turned in my terminal gate chair unable to return to sleep. I peaked at my cell phone watch over and over again; it seemed as if boarding time would never come.      After about 7 cycles of CNN news I finally was allowed to board the plane. On the plane I could fall fast sleep, but only if I tried to read a recent JAMA article. The flight was uneventful, but as we descended to the RDU area I could see again the familiar tall treetops that always masked the horizon to the road traveler. Evergreens and bare deciduous arbors are everywhere.       While I’m in baggage claim I get a call from Melanie Michel, a friend from TCOM. We quickly catch up with either other’s respective spring break adventures. Mel offers her sympathies regarding the recent Duke loss to Maryland, and I thank her for the gesture. Yeah, Duke really sucked it up big time, yet somehow still maintains a #1 seed.       Mel and I conclude our conversation as I find my last piece of luggage. Outside as I wait for a ride I spot my first Duke contact. John Barrows was a Pegram resident of mine two years ago. He’s now a junior pre-med, and oh how I sympathize with the junior premed. Life is hell in that stage of life, isn’t it? John and I are both waiting for our rides for about 15 minutes. John eventually sees his ride and bids adieu to me. Moments later, Scott Atkinson shows up in his new Passatt. He hasn’t really changed much that I can tell. When I talk with him I realize what things have changed. He’s much more mellow. A year of carrying heavy Internal Coordinator burdens has brought him to a point where he must pick his battles carefully. The little things no longer concern him. With law school choices abound, he is looking forward to graduating and moving on to the next phase of his life.       Scott takes me all the way back to Duke’s campus, where there are all sorts of obvious physical changes that have happened over the year. Where else would I visit first upon arriving to Duke than the DUEMS office. In there I find Jared, Marshall, and Dyson. It’s really begun; I’m back at Duke and I’m seeing these people all over again. A number of things catch my eye first: the new office arrangement, the new squad uniforms, and yet another new computer. As we begin our hellos I suddenly feel welcomed. I wear no nametag; I am no second-class citizen; I am accepted, recognized, and appreciated all over again. More and more people arrive throughout the day at this seeming Grand Central Station. Most of the faces are familiar, but many are new, and some just downright confused me (the Jones twins have since exchanged each other’s hair style).       Without warning I walk into a newly refurbished Student Activities Office so that I might surprise Angie Thornburg. A quick “oh my gosh” sets the stage for another reunion hug. Angie is looking great and her day is fairly busy, but she skips a few phone calls for me so that we might have some time to catch up. We talk about her daughter turning 16, her search for a new house, and Jake Woods’s gossip. Angie was one of those women whom I was pretty conversant with day after day. She makes the Student Activities Office a fun place to be.       The sky eventually greyed so that it might rain at any time. I rushed to the biology building in a whimsical attempt to find Dahl Clark. Remarkably I find her in Bio 046. Her hair is shorter, neater, and her clothes look newer. In a complete academic role reversal she tells me that she’s switching back to physics after biology had rubbed her the wrong way over the years. She is on her way to teach her biology lab class so I leave her pressed for time.       David Strauss takes me over to the EMT-B class. On our way we talk about the successes and frustrations with the EMT class. Dave took on the heavy load of the EMT class last year, but since then he began to try and replace Kim and Barb. I told him that I regretting having left the EMT class situation on such unsure footing. I worked so hard to try to make the class a mainstay and an institution within our squad…their squad.       Barbara Jackson was one of my EMT instructors back in the summer of 2000, and she’s still teaching it. She had a pretty genuine smile on her face the whole time I was visiting with her, but I had to wonder what was really going through her mind      On the phone Sunny Wang was energetic and funny. One of my past crew chiefs, she is now a first year student (like myself) at Duke Med (unlike myself). We were making plans to meet on Wednesday for dinner.      Jake Woods is still Jake Woods. On the phone he was willing to drop everything he was working on just to talk to me. He’s got this new online startup project that he told me about, something like an online personal trainer. It sounds like a pretty extensive venture; he got the idea after talking business with his own personal trainer.      Steve and Jared have their own plans worked out for the future. Both will have their EMT-I by this fall and plan to be working for Durham County EMS. Steve, who will be taking this next year before entering medical school, will be living with Jared in a nearby apartment starting this summer. Steve has been quite nice and hospitable. He’s housing me for two nights of my stay. Like many other seniors he’s biding his time ‘till graduation. The MCI drill, the rugby tournament, and any possible NCAA basketball bonfire staffing will be all she wrote for Barmach before he moves on to bigger and better things. Jared, a junior, is tired of Duke. A crew chief now, he doesn’t seem to have the same zeal for training that I remember having. He’s frustrated by an intense bureaucratic structure that is choking him. Duke EMS has taken him only so far. He needs to be challenged in new ways, and I hope that working for Durham County will be that new challenge he needs. Steve, Jared, and I stood for long time outside the West Union arch discussing these important life choices and other squad issues that have recently come up. A night-time rain begins slowly and at this point and I am once again amazed at how beautiful this campus really is. I took so much for granted.       As the rain starts to fall, I make my way over to Brownstone with Scott. As I arrive I immediately see Julie, the “EMS groupie” and one of Suel’s good friends whom I’ve come to know over the years. I was very happy to see Sue-Ellen again. She seems more vital and lively than I remember seeing her last. Ah, thinking of those days when we were very good friends. Somehow our dedication to the squad warped our relationship seemingly beyond repair, but once again time heals wounds and we can once again laugh about all those stupid things. Pam, Sarah, Trey and other Brownstone people I know come to say hello again; I begin to feel the symptoms of social anxiety disorder (that I self-diagnosed) return as everyone’s eyes are focused on my face…and my new facial hair, which seems to be getting mixed reviews.       I eventually settle down on east campus after 1 a.m. in Steve’s room. Before going to sleep Steve asks me what I think of the squad so far. That’s certainly a big question and at first I don’t know what to say. Everything I’ve seen thus far is mainly superficial; perhaps I’ll know more before I leave. But finally I tell Steve that I’m not here to judge or critique. I have my own life now away from all this. My hope is that all the graduating seniors can look back on their EMS experience in a positive light. If my visit can help some people put things in perspective then the trip’s been worth a dern to me. All the while I think of Jen and her fall resignation. I’m confused by it all and wish it didn’t happen the way it did.       It’s been one long day and I began to rapidly tire. My next few days would be booked, but I don’t think about that as I drifted off. This stuff is so much fun. I realize once again why it meant so much to me. Actually, I don’t. It’s an intangible sort of intense passion that I now associate with Duke EMS. Now in medical school, I hope to develop that same passion for …something, just something that might give me the same sort of direction and personal satisfaction.

       (From March 12, 2004 before falling asleep)  It’s spring break, there’s nothing to do, and I’m loving it. In less than 48 hours I’ll be back at Duke for who knows what kind of spring break craziness. I bought my tickets a number of months ago back when it felt like spring break would never arrive. Now that I have to think about packing I’m not real sure why I’m going back. It’ll be a fun trip, of course, but it really doesn’t even feel like I’ve been away for a year. Why come back now? What is that all about?  Why is it that I always have to think of a reason why? Can’t I ever be spontaneous at all? So what if I feel like I’ve burned all the bridges behind me. Damn, this is what I hate about blog writing. What I end up writing is always so damn self-depricating. I think ideally I would like to remind myself of all the people and places who influenced who I am and where I am in my life now. While at Duke I had mentors, role models and a sense of direction (mostly in my last two years). Now I feel like I'm adrift once again, freshman-style.

      Yep, I'm still tired. One week left before spring break. I really haven't been doing anything lately besides studying. Hell, I didn't even leave my apartment saturday, that's how bad it is. I've got 4 exams this next week, but that means I can spend spring break however I want to. This last thursday I did get to go see The Passion of Christ. Man, I still get chills when I think about some of the scenes there. I really liked the movie and I think it made it on to my top 100 list. Yes, I keep a listing. Whoa...now I have something to talk about, cool! Ok, a while back I made a listing of my top 100 movies. I rated them based on 3 independent criteria (quality, # of times seen, desire to see again). The top 20 are as follows:  1. The Last Picture Show 2. 2001: A Space Odyssey 3. The Wizard of Oz 4. Man of La Mancha 5. Terms of Endearment 6. Lost and Delirious 7. What's Eating Gilbert Grape 8. The Last Temptation of Christ 9. Contact 10. Lost in Translation 11. All Quiet on the Western Front 12. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King 13. Six Degrees of Seperation 14. Born on the Fourth of July 15. Playing by Heart 16. Ghandi 17. Good Will Hunting 18. Unforgiven 19. Dead Poets Society 20. The Big Chill   The Last Picture Show and Terms of Endearment were both written by Larry McMurtry, my favorite fiction writer. See them both and you won't be disappointed. OK, gotta study again, so see you later.    Song of the Day: "St. Teresa", Joan Osborne

      I'm so tired. I think I got 8 hours of total sleep this last weekend. I went down to Austin with our local American Medical Association (AMA) chapter for a conference. It was alright, but I'm still trying to recooperate from it. So yeah, this morning I took my G.I. exam and I've just been vegging since then.  ..... OK, I think I'm too tired to really write paragraphs with a complete thought anymore, so I'm just going to write random stuff. This thursday I'm planning on going to see that movie the Passion of the Christ with a few people. Spring break is 2 weeks away. I'm really stoked about these new tablet PC's that they have. I'm hoping that my next computer will be one.  I only saw about 20 minutes of the Oscars, but I did get to see Jack Black and Will Farrell's duet. It's soooo hot right now. Later!

      I've got these huge reproduction exams on monday and tuesday. It'll be real good to get those done. But you don't want to hear about my exams, no sir. Well, how about this...I'm taking a group of people to the White Settlement Health Fair tomorrow for our Texas Medical Association group. That'll be cool. No? Well how about this. Last week I went out to the Fox and Hound bar downtown for the first time with a couple friends. I actually had about 4 drinks, which is more than I've had in quite some time. We spent a good amount of time trashing some of our more annoying classmates.   There's some way I'm supposed to be able to put pictures on this biotch, but I don't know how just yet. Oh, I just remembered something I can write about. For the last week we've been learning about the well-man and well-woman exams. These include breast, genital and rectal exams. Next week I will be doing all of those for the first time. We will actually be doing these exams on real patients, which is a huge deal to any first year med student like myself. I mean, huge as in a little nerve racking, yet intriguing at once. Seriously, how many times in your life does a normal person feel cervixes, prostates, and whatnot? That's really all I can think of. Peace out, fools.   Songs of the day   Heart of Gold , Neil Young, 1972.  Bigger Than My Body , John Mayer, 2003.

      These last few days have been pretty good. The part about Duke losing in the NCAA semifinals really sucked, but everything else has been pretty peachy here.  I've been meeting with a number of different people lately and having pretty good conversations with 'em, so that's what I'm going to write about this evening.  Two nights ago I was over at Edmund Ho's apartment. He fixed dinner for Peter, Omar, Melanie and myself. It was real nice 'cause it got us to forget about our awful renal tests earlier that day.  Edmund is Houston Rockets fan and is actually pretty politically-minded. We got to talking about Bush vs. Kerry, the obesity epidemic, gay marriage, all kinds of things and I really enjoyed it. We share many social views, but differ a lot on the U.S. foreign policy/foreign aid ideas.  While I was at Edmund's place I got a call from Michael Barham (my old RA supervisor and good friend) and I was really surprised to learn that he was in Philedelphia with Ashley Colburn (my RA friend from Asheville, NC). He's there on a conference until sunday. It would have been fun to be there with them, but I was at least glad that they seemed to be having a good time together.   On friday evening I worked first aid at the Fort Worth Race for the Cure. I put in about 10 hours of work and was completely spent after it was done. While I was there I worked with Gabe Tarango and Gary Howard. Gabe Tarango is in my first-year class and it a pretty fun guy to talk with. Like me, he lives a somewhat tame and boring life right now, but last year during his senior year of college he was a party animal. He was also dating an older, very nice looking physical therapy student for about 7 months. We both talked at length about wanting to get out into the city and meet new people.   Gary Howard is an EMT and paramedic-student. He was pretty much running the first-aid show there at the Race for the Cure. Damn, I don't even know where to begin with this guy. I should say that one of the fascinating things about EMS is that the people are so damn interesting. Seriously, you have to some kind of seriously interesting character to want to get into EMS and Gary was certainly interesting. I'd say that Gary is probably in his 50's, is a Vietnam War veteran, and came into EMS a few years ago after selling his previous two businesses. He's also a bit of a cowboy and has a shit-load of stories about saving stupid people's lives out in the middle of nowhere. We talked for most of the evening and it was pretty enjoyable. Talking with him helped remind me how much I miss EMS.   Will McKnight came over on saturday to watch the Duke game. We had fajitas. Will and I spent a lot of time looking at crazy crap on the internet and yelling at the TV. We did talk a little bit about the lifestyles of those on "regular hours" versus those on "student hours." He said he misses being able to stay up past 10pm, whereas sometimes I feel like I would do anything to go to sleep and get up earlier. We had a good time I think. It's very reassuring to know that I have friends outside of my med school class.    Like I said, stuff is going pretty well right now and my renal grades turned out ok. The weather's nice and my allergies are subsiding, so I'm pretty happy. I've been in Fort Worth for almost a year now and I am starting to feel at home.    Songs of the day  Moby,  Porcelain , 1999.

      On Memorial Day I want to write real briefly about my closest connection with a war veteran. When I was 5 years old we were living in Cross Plains, Texas. Our next-door neighbors were Hubert and Celia Beleuw. They were an older couple in their 60s at the time. Both my mom and dad worked and I wasn't in school yet, so Hubert and Celia (everyone called her Sis) took care of me for a whole year. I have lots of stories about them taking care of me during the days, but I didn't find out until many years later that Hubert was in World War II. He was a decorated infantryman at the Battle of the Bulge. While he was in combat he started smoking and he kept on smoking for 40 years until the day that they saw that my mom needed help finding day care during the days. Right before they started watching me he kicked his cigarette habit cold-turkey. All that time I was just too young to really appreciate Hubert and Sis; they both passed away about 4 years ago. They were a part of "the greatest generation."

      Last night there was a party over at Joey Heitzman's place. Joey lives just two doors down from me. That guy can cook. He fed about 10 people and all of us were amazed at how much effort he put into it. John Abraham brought over some Knob Creek bourbon too, very good stuff. At midnight we all went out to the Flying Saucer down at Sundance Square. All of us were pressuring Molini to get a tatoo. She's the most straight-laced, level headed person among us, so it was funny...you just had to be there.   Today I'm meeting with my folks at the Gaylord Texan Hotel. It's this new place that opened up that's supposed to be one of the nicest places in the Southwest. I guess I am getting older when I look forward to spending some time with my folks. Man, just 5 years ago I couldn't wait to be 1,200 miles away from them. Anyway, I need to start packing.   A local radio station is doing all 80's all weekend. Certain 80's rock can be very cheezy, granted, but it's unlike any other kind of music and it's great for when you just want to forget everything else going on. My songs of the day reflect my appreciation for the phenom that is 80's music.    Songs of the day   The Boys of Summer , Don Henley, 1984.  Every Breath You Take , The Police, 1983.  Your Love , The Outfield, 1985.   Pour Some Sugar On Me , Def Leppard, 1987.   If You Leave , OMD, 1988.

      Memorial Day weekend is here finally, and summer is finally here. It's about damn time. I've still got a month left of school, but this three day weekend is much needed. Pathology is pretty grueling work; I can't remember having ever studied harder than I studied this last week, but for now I'm just going to try to forget about all that and hang out with friends and family.   Last night there were about 8 of us over at Omar's place 'till about 2am. It was awesome to finally hang loose a little bit. Finally there was someone there who would drink with me! I don't know what it is about the friends I know, but none of them ever seem to drink. I think I'm caught in the middle sometimes: too introverted and reserved to have fun among the drinking crowd, yet too ... **I don't know the word** to be able to have fun with those who don't drink. Basically, I gotta have something to loosen the tension, be it EtOH, Zoloft, whatever. Anyway, last night was fun.   A couple days ago I heard from my good friend Fernando. He's one of my best friends from TAMS and is finishing up his business degree at UNT. I hadn't seen or heard from him since new years day. The last time I saw him he gave me a DVD of all the videos he took of our group of friends while we were at TAMS. It was a very cool gift. However, we got into this unfortunate discussion about how I've changed. Fern thinks that since having come back from Texas I'm much more of a hard-ass. I got really upset about that. I'm not upset about what he said 'cause it's mostly true. I'm not like I was at TAMS; People and situations change. Isn't that a normal part of the college experience? What I'm upset about is that he doesn't appreciate how and why I am the way I am. What I'm upset about is that Fern likes to live his life like a series of Friends episodes. The videos he took of all his friends in HS are picture perfect, but they're all taken out of context and detached from real life (which is always less sit-com and more prosaic). I don't know...this whole topic is a little depressing. Moving on now...  I don't know why people think that the Pirates of the Caribbean movie is so cool. I saw it today and it was pretty boring I thought.    Songs of the day   I'm Always In Love , Wilco, 1999.   Desperately Wanting , Better Than Ezra, 1996.

           So it seems that when I was writing my last blog I had some anger management issues. I'm doing much better now and I'm far less irritable. These last few days haven't been too eventful (studying and all), but one of the cool things is that I've made some connections to and between old friends.        I recently got a random IM message from Anup Shetty and I found out that he's in his first year of medical school at UT Southwestern in Dallas. This was really cool news. Anup Shetty and I knew of each other all through our time at Duke. Our last names were close to each other, we took a lot of the same pre-med classes, we were in the same freshman dorm and we had a lot of mutual friends, however, we didn't (and still don't) really know each other that well. Now that I'm in Fort Worth I've realized that there are just some occasions (namely basketball season) where you wish there were some other Duke people around, and who else is better than Anup? He's a real nice guy and he was even more of a Cameron crazy than I was. I'm going to have to get over to Southwestern sometime since there are now about 3 people I know over there.       I was chatting with Will McKnight last night. Will and I went through grade school together at Krum and we now both live here in Fort Worth. He said that he ran into and spent some time hanging out with Caleb Stone and Jeremy Villeneuve recently. Caleb and Jeremy were also friends of mine all those years at Krum, but I haven't seen or heard from them in 5 years. Will was also able to get a phone number for Tim Purnell. Tim was one of my best friends at Krum, but after he graduated from Krum I lost touch with him completely. See, this is what happens when I spend 4 years out of the state. Tim is married now and apparently lives in Sanger somewhere. I'm planning on contacting him sometime soon. How do you make that call though? "Hi, this is Doug. I haven't heard from you in 5 years. Sup?"       Finally, I just found out that one of my current TCOM classmates, Liz Rankin, knows Will McKnight from Austin College. She dated Will McKnight's roommate at some point while she was there. I wouldn't have figured there'd be a connection between the Krum and TCOM spheres of my life, but I guess there's only six degrees of separation between any one person and everyone else on the planet so I shouldn't be surprised.        Finally again, I found out that a Texas friend of mine is pregnant. I won't say whom, but she's already 5 months pregnant. It's been about 5 months since I've seen her also.        That's it. I've got to study now. This time around it's genetic disorders. Peace.    Songs of the day   Linger , Cranberries, 1993.   Ava Adore , Smashing Pumpkins, 1998.

      **This blog entry is rated PG-17 for language** I wish I could always say what's on my mind. Wouldn't that be great if we could all just say whatever we wanted without any consequences? See, there's this one person who I'd really like to tell off. However, we work in an organization together so I can't exactly just tell her to go fuck herself like I would like to. Instead I just try to avoid talking to her at all, but man if I could only let the language flow from my mouth like water from a fire hydrant I'd tell her to go lock herself in a dark room and fuck herself repeatedly. She's such a bitch, and not in that cool Meredith Brooks kind of way either. This is a cold, petty, stupid, and irritating kind of bitchiness. Do her bitch-powers have no bounds? As I recall the stories of young King Arthur pulling his sword, Excalibur, from the stone I wonder who but King Arthur himself can pull out the stick from this girl's necrotic ass?  In more political news, my mother is actually considering voting for some democrats this time around. My mom is a veteran teacher who's been screwed over along with countless other teachers. Teachers in her position have their salaries frozen at 20 years of teaching experience. When you combine that with the fact that their health benefits keep on getting cut and that their requirements for retirement will probably increase it means that she will be getting paid less each year for the next several years and that she'll be forced to work 5 more years just to qualify for retirement. Educators are getting fucked by the Texas State Legislature. It's been this way for years and it's been due to dems and reps alike, but generally democrats are more friendly to teachers. I'm telling you something, whenever you get a conservative like my mother to consider voting democratic you know you've really fucked things up for her.

      Pathology is pretty tough. I just barely passed my quiz today, so I really need to spend some time studying and less time blogging and playing volleyball. Anyway, there's nothing really going on with me lately. Tomorrow I'll go home for Mother's Day and sunday will be one year to the day that I graduated from Duke. It's amazing because it seems like it was yesterday.   Speaking of it feeling like it was yesterday, today I got a call from Michael Barham of all people. He was on a 7-hour layover at DFW so I got to go pick him up and show him the Fort Worth scene. Michael Barham was my graduate assistant (RA-boss of sorts) my senior year at Duke. The last time I saw him was a year ago on graduation day.   I guess that's it. See ya later.   Songs of the day   Interstate Love Song , Stone Temple Pilots, 1994.

      These past two weeks have been pretty eventful. I bet I had something like 10 exams in the last 14 days. The good news is that my first year of medical school is almost over. I've just got an 8-week pathology course left. Basically, that means I have no labs, no patients to see, no nothing, just a whole lot of book learning. I don't mind this at all because it means I can concentrate on one thing for once.  On Monday I worked for a few hours in the hyperbaric medicine department. High pressure oxygen is often used to expedite the healing process for your more difficult wounds. The most common hyperbaric patients seem to be diabetics (since T2DM is endemic in this country), but hypoxic patients also benefit from hyperbarics. Among other things I got to see an awfully narly food wound (caused by diabetic neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease) that made me a little bit queazy.  On Tuesday I had my final physical exam test. I got 237 out of 250 points, which is not bad I don't think.   On Wednesday I spent most of the day traveling to Corpus Christi for my 2-day preceptorship, which took place on Thursday and Friday. I was assigned to Dr. Vanderheiden who runs a family practice clinic at the Bay Area Medical Center at Corpus Christi. I quickly learned that Dr. V was a challenging physician to shadow. Dr. V frequently quizzes his students in front of patients and wastes no time letting you know what he thinks of you. At the end of the first day I was exhausted. I felt so stupid; I have got so incredibly much to learn. By the second day I had his personality figured out a little bit more and he had a better idea of where exactly I was in my training. By the end of the second day I felt much better and I now have a better idea of what my rotations will be like.   Today was all for me. I did nothing but relax and enjoy the beautiful day. Tomorrow I'll probably go and get a haircut.    Songs of the day   Love Profusion , Madonna, 2004.   Walk of Life , Dire Straits, 1985.  Good Stuff , Kelis, 1999.

       Lessons Learned                                                           It's still hard to believe that my first year of med school is done. I now have all this time on my hands that I don't know what to do with...well, not so much time. There's really only 5 weeks.    alt="My friend Peter">  It's about that time of year when everyone's getting back in touch with old friends and whatnot. In the last day I've gotten emails from or talked with 5 Duke friends and Will, a guy I went to high school with. One thing I've started doing is writing letters to people. Why? Well, 'cause email sucks, that's why. Shouldn't email just be used to send quick messages to people? More meaningful messages just don't work with email. For these kinds of messages you just can't beat a real hand-written letter. It's an art that's been lost among our generation.   In the last year I've learned some pretty important stuff that isn't tested on board exams. I've listed a few of these lessons below:  1. It's easy to blame the world or others around me, but usually I'm the biggest cause of my own problems. See, a year ago I thought that coming back home would solve the problems that I had while I was at Duke. While parking is much easier here, the real problems I have don't resolve themselves just with a change in venue.   2. I spend way too much time feeling unsatisfied. I really should be more thankful for what I have, especially given that I've never really had to fear for my own life.   3. I'm not used to change and/or asking for help, but there's an absolute time for both. Pathology was probably the most difficult course for me this year; I would not have improved as much as I did without the help of my tutoring group.   I think those are the biggest 3. Oh, hey, I almost forgot to mention...I'm going to Las Vegas! On July 11th I'll be going with 3 other friends to Vegas for a week of crazy, kick-ass fun. Awe-some!    Songs of the day   Breaking the Girl , Red Hot Chili Peppers, 1991.  Trouble Me , 10,000 Maniacs, 1989.  All Nite (Don't Stop) , Janet Jackson, 2004.

       Stick a fork in me                                                       I'm finally done with year one and it feels quite good. At last it's time to let loose.

       Frustration with Election-Year Politics    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate today's election-year politics. Month after month it's the same polarizing talk of status-quo and reform that leads to little or no action. And to think that the hours upon hours of televised political discourse only matter for about 10% of the voting population that hasn't already made up its mind yet.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's ironic to me also that while there's so much political bickering there's very little difference between Bush and Kerry on the big issues. Both of them were in favor of using force in Iraq (though Kerry would have preferred to wait it out longer). Both of them support Bush tax cuts (though Kerry would repeal the tax cuts for a very small percentage of the population). Both of them are against gay marriage ultimately, though Kerry would pursue a more hands-off approach to banning gay marriage. Bush added a perscription drug coverage element to medicare while Kerry has not really opposed it or provided any details on health care reforms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, there are several areas where Bush and Kerry differ widely (education, affirmative action, the U.S. role in the U.N.) but these issues don't get near as much playtime as those mentioned previously. Why that is I'm not sure. So while the political pundits keep on punting their political footballs back and forth I might as well go fix myself a drink, sit back, and watch some Star Trek.

       Medical Preceptorship Anxiety                                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m a little nervous. In less than two days I’ll start a 4-day preceptorship with Dr. Perry in Sanger, Texas, but I’m about 3 weeks out of my first year of medical school and I’m almost 3 months out of my first clinical medicine class. I know that I’ll learn a lot, but when I think back to my first day working with Dr. Vanderheiden about three months ago I remember it being so rough. That experience and the final pathology course really gave me a kick in the ass and showed me how stupid I really am. I guess I’ve got to stop worrying about what I can’t control and instead focus on doing a good job for the one D.O. that works in my neighborhood. It’s a cool opportunity.

       Four of Us in Las Vegas    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went with three friends to   Las Vegas   this last week. Each of us had different expectations, and different overall impressions of this place, but we all wanted desperately to have some fun before the realities of second-year medical school set in. John Abraham, Joey Heitzman, and Omar Villanueva are the three guys who traveled with me to Vegas; I came to know each of these guys during the last year, but we really had very little shared experiences. I’m very glad that this trip has given us something to talk and laugh about when times get tough in the next few months.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John, our blackjack expert, is probably the most vocal and extroverted of our group. His energy, humor, and ability to communicate well thought-out ideas make him a very successful conversationalist. He’s also very adept at studying personality types, for I learned more about the people in our medical school class just by talking with John than from my own knowledge. On many occasions I felt that he carried our group from one Las Vegas encounter to the next. He pretty much figured out most of our social agenda, which worked out well since he had been in Vegas only three months earlier. I’m not sure why, but John recommended that I listen to Stevie Wonder. I think his suggestion had something to do with helping me to quell my bad mood (at the time).&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joey, the slots-master, is also very extroverted, but on top of that I’d say he has a knack for witty conversation and sense of style. Joey has been living right across the hall from me for about a year now, but until this trip I didn’t realize how truly funny he really is. John and Omar bring out this side of Joey; it’s amazing to me how John and Joey have such control over the mood of our group. Joey’s sense of style is impeccable; he likes very nice, expensive things. I have a very difficult time relating to some of these values, but I try to respect them.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Omar, who doesn’t gamble, yet still won $30 is a very considerate, perceptive friend. He always senses when something is wrong and wants to help resolve problems. I’ve spent the most time with Omar in the past year, but recently I’ve lost touch with him sense he started dating a mutual friend of ours. Omar didn’t particularly like Las Vegas. I originally thought that Vegas had something for everybody, but I guess I was mistaken. Also, Omar does not drink. This personal choice has sometimes come between Omar and myself, but I have to admire his noble ability to find enjoyment without alcohol. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we left Vegas today I think we could all sense that it was time for us to spend some time apart, for five straight days of the same people can wear on a person. However, as I drove home in the silence of my own car I actually started feeling a little lonely. All those fun days and nights had gone by so quickly that I even failed to really recognize the fun I was having. I miss it already. Vegas, though excessively materialistic, commercial, gaudy, and crowded is the place for making and building new friendships based on shared experiences that can’t be replicated anywhere else.&nbsp;

       The Catcher in the Rye                                                    Somehow I got through high school without ever having read The Catcher in The Rye, by J. D. Salinger. I’ve heard all about this book through the years; it’s been alluded to in many of my favorite books and movies. Since I’ve had some spare time in the last few days I picked this book up and decided to give it a try. Now that I’ve finished it I consider it to be one of the best.   Salinger’s main character is Holden Caulfield who is a very troubled teenager. The reader eventually sees that Holden’s account of his own problems is unreliable. The most important clues as to the causes of his problems is only briefly mentioned if at all; when one considers these clues and the entirety of his actions one sees that Holden is desperately searching for an intimate connection. Unfortunately, his self-destructive behavior often gets in the way.  There are several great ideas presented in this book the first of which is the human need for intimacy. Holden oftentimes is unaware of his own motivations saying he’s “a madman” whenever he reaches out to others, every time ultimately ending in failure. I feel that this message is particularly important for young men. Our society and most of the world instills in boys a stoic, emotionless quality; this gender socialization, in my mind, really inhibits men and makes them more prone to mental and other health problems as is evident with Holden.   Another great idea from the character Mr. Antolini is the observation that some people, like Holden, are in a terrible kind of fall where they are unable to see or feel themselves fall. Mr. Antolini’s advice addresses the dramatic irony of the book, namely that the reader realizes Holden’s terrible fall while Holden himself does not. Salinger suggests that one needs the external environment to help us realize when one has fallen; Holden does not realize his fall because “feeling” and “seeing” are both sensory perceptions stimulated by the external environment, of which Holden is detached.   The interesting title of the book represents Salinger’s last great idea, namely that an essential part of life is being there for others. When pressured by his sister to name one thing he’s interested in Holden can only say that he imagines a person catching other people running through the rye field who would otherwise fall over a nearby cliff. Holden finally finds a connection with his younger sister who keeps him from running away. As a medical student this message has been one of my central motivations. No matter how screwed up my own life is I can give my experiences more meaning by helping others.   I highly recommend reading The Catcher in The Rye. We can all relate in some form to Holden’s “life-at-a-crossroads” experience. Personally, after having finished my freshman year at medical school I found myself sympathizing with Holden at times, for there were times when I felt that I didn’t give a crap for anyone in my class. Everyone seemed “phony” to me, but unlike Holden I realize that I need to be more tolerant and not as quick-to-judge. While these are my own interpretations at this stage of my life, this novel no doubt has some important messages for everyone at various stages of life.

       A Letter To Jake                                                Jake,  I just got back from a small party and I just got to remembering how college was. Anytime something was going on in my life I could go to the EMS office and 90% of the time you'd be up there working your ass off on some project that was due in 12 hours or something. No matter what you had going on as soon as I walked in the door you always made time for me and we'd have a good time just talking...about anything, it didn't matter. I would sit down in those shitty chairs and you'd let me bitch, bitch, bitch about my life. You also let me in on your life and it was therapeutic like that. Why aren't there people like you in my medical school class? I really wish there was, but no, there can only be one Jake Woods.  So I'm a week into classes now. Yep, we got practically no summer. I did get to go to Vegas for 5 days with some friends though. That was in mid July. Man did I drink. I actually got really smashed the night before school started. Can you imagine me coming into the first day of class with a heinous hangover? Who would have figured? Well I did it and it sucked. That night was fun as hell, but that monday sucked butt. You know one of the biggest reasons why it sucked butt? I discovered that morning that I broke one of my favorite shot glasses. I completely shattered it. I also apparently cut myself accidentally with it in several different places. Seriously, I woke up looking like I got the shit beat out of me but I don't remember a thing. That's very scary sounding, but don't worry, everything's fine now.  Jake, I've got a question for you...more like a series of statements. I'm starting to get concerned about my mental health. Med school is really fucking with my mind. I'm probably just blowing things out of proportion, but I don't know. I've no basis for comparison. I know about bipolar disorder and I don't think I'm bipolar just because I don't think my behavior changes eratically, but I do go through these periods of hi-low-hi-low and when I'm low it's like I have a really hard time getting things done. This is probably just normal, but it still sucks. I probably just really need to get laid. It's so frustrating sometimes.   Tonight, just before I was leaving for the party I went by friend's apartment to get him so that we could carpool. He tells me at the last minute that he's not going. It's a small thing, no big deal, right? I know that in one part of my brain, but the part I listen to is telling me that I'm not being studious enough and that I should not be going out to a party. I become angry thinking that he's on this bandwagon of new habits and that going to a party with me is a bad habit. Of course these things probably aren't true. Later I find out that he's trying to avoid someone else...so I had been preoccupied with anger and confusion all night for no reason really.  I don't know jack about life. Sometimes I think I pick up on clues and signals here and there, but I'm really just floating around from one interesting flicker to the next. Does being engaged alleviate some of this craziness? I've got to go now in order to put a stop to my rambling. As I look back on this email it's so crazy and disordered. I really should delete it and start over again, but no, I'm not going to. It is fuckin' the way it is, right or not-so-right.   Here's to your Saturday night and write back anytime. I love email a little too much.  DS
