       Phew...Just finished my dinner...Today is a normal day for me again...Nothing special happened... Went to school , study , come back and sleep... Tomorrow will be the first day of trial examination and I am totally not ready yet... Not even a subject... Not even half a subject... Maybe because I cannot concentrate lately... I wonder what will my result be...Will it stay the same ? Or become worse ? Perhaps become better ? I don`t know... I am so confused now... Maybe because what happened last night... Last night , I sms her again... I asked her if I can walk her out of the school today... And then she replied "Thx for offering but I get used to walk alone ler..." Maybe she is trying to tell me something in that message... Maybe she wants to tell me something , but she afraid that it will hurt my feelings... Well...who knows ? All I can do now is guessing... Or maybe I`m just thinking too much ? Some of my friends suggested me to give up , some suggested to give her time... Time uh ? How long would it be ? If she needs time , she should have tell me... Maybe she does not need any... All I can do now is wait if time is the factor... I`m just too confuse now... Time will tell...

      Wow...A very tiring day indeed... Like usual I woke up in the morning...But today I was a little late because I was too lazy to wake up until my mom had to wake me up... Then went to school...Just like normal school days... It was raining a little and the wheather was cold... There was a "Tongue Twister" competition held in our class today... It was quite competative and everyone is good... The winner falls to one of my friend in next class... I must admit she was quite good... The speed and the pronouncation was really clear...Then at 1.30pm , I came back home...I was too tired so I rest in the sofa for 15 minutes... I was asleep and dreamt about her again xD~... I was walking and talking with her on the way to a class...Then suddenly her ex came and POOF , I woke up ! It was quite a weird dream though... Maybe it is a sign I should give up...But NO , I will not... I will not let this kind of things bring me down... I must continue till the end... Then , after my lunch , I went to sleep again... I took my bath at 6.30pm and had my dinner at 7.00pm... After finished watching Malaysian Idol , I went to study until 10.00pm... I was asleep again and I woke up at 10.30pm... Luckily this time no weird dreams for me... Then I continued study until 11.00pm... I guess I got to stop here now cause it is already 11.48pm... I need to sleep and continue my study tomorrow...

      LOL...I think you all are getting the wrong idea...But before that , let me tell you about my day...Erm I woke up at 8.00am this morning...Like usual brush my teeth , wash my face and go out for breakfast... I had a "kon lao kuei tiaw" for breakfast xD~...Not too delicious and not too bad either... Then after that , we went home(me and my parents)...I did not study until 10.30am...Just hearing some musics and relaxing myself...Then I started to study until 4.00pm...In between I did chat with friends , replying e-mails , and watching TV too... Man , the TV programmes today were great...Can`t really concentrate in study...After that I took my bath and then started to blog...  Now let me explain about the previous post... I mentioned that she was with her ex&nbsp;watching fireworks... But I didn`t mention that she get back with her ex... Perhaps they "might" get back together but not sure when...Maybe they have been together already...Who knows ? But to tell you all , I will not give up now...I cannot let her know I`m down...&nbsp;I&nbsp;must continue this battle untill the very end... Until where swords and shields are broken...&nbsp;Maybe I`m giving myself some false hope but this will not be the end... I must continue...

      Today was a very sad and bad day...I should have not gone to the buffet dinner...This morning I woke up at 9.30am... And then I watched tv and study until 4.00pm...Then I prepared to go to the buffet dinner because my friend was going to pick me up from my house at 5.00pm... Around 5.00pm , my friend came and pick me up to Sutera Harbour with another friend together... After 10 - 15 minutes ride , we reached there... There were a lot of people prepared to run for the 7k... That`s when we knew we went there too early... So we decided to sit in the "magazine room" and wait for other friends... Not long after that , she came... 4 of us went to the "sea side" and decided to wait other friends there... At 6.45pm all was present... We went for the buffet dinner at Five Sails... She was sitting beside me , both of us was embrassed... At 8.00+pm , her friend came and joined us... After the dinner , me , her and her friend went for a walk around... We also took some pictures... We did talked a little and having a chat... It was all fine... Then , her friend told that she wanted to have a little talk with her so I gave them a little privacy and went back to find my friends and they walked away... Soon , the fireworks started and I can`t see both of them... As the fireworks finished , there I saw her and her ex together... Everything was turned into pieces... She also walked pass me and didn`t even say a goodbye... I was so speechless and just watched them walked away... Now I felt that swords are stabbing my heart... I also understand why people said that girl`s tears flow from the eye while boy`s tears flow from the heart... My heart is bleeding now... Real pain came to me... Maybe my friends are right that she had rejected me from quite sometime...Maybe I`m just a friend to her... Everything seems to be hopeless... I`m just too sad to blog longer...

      Uh...Welcome to my new blog...I gave you all this address because I trust you all...So don`t make me disappointed... Erm...Today is a normal day or a sad day ? I`m also not sure...This morning I woke up at 5am and went to school at 6am...Nothing special happens during the school lessons...During the school lesson, I received the CD that she said she wanted to borrow me...But she was so cold at me...She did not even smile when she gave me the CD...Then after school , me and my friend was staying back for the Indoor Games Club and also for the Hornbill meeting...At first we went to the hall to take a look on the "prayer meeting"... After that , we went back to the canteen to have our lunch...I did not eat anything because I was still full... Then , we went to the office to hang around there... And yes , she and her ex were there with other friends... I did not want to disturb them so I was sitting outside playing the other computer... I was waiting for the Hornbill meeting... Then she came and see what I`m doing and ask me to go in and join the other friends...So I went in do nothing...Just having some chatting with friends and teachers... She was chatting with her ex happily in their own world... I wasn`t really care about that and I did not really feel jealous about that...But somehow suddenly I felt I have lost all my confident...When I saw them so close , I was feeling that I should just give up... Who knows if they will get back together ? Who knows ? However , I tell myself not to give up...I must continue this battle...My brain told me that but my heart tells me that I should give up...What should I do ? One of my friend told me that she said she don`t even like me... Maybe this is the sign which the story will end soon... I remembered she told me once that relationship starts with smile , grows with hug , and ends with tears...This relationship haven`t start and grow yet but it`s already ended with tears...Will the relationship start ? Sigh*...  &nbsp;

        Wow...Today was another normal day for me... Trial exam is already a week and still got a week to go... Didn`t do well in the exam but I have tried my best... Today we took Sejarah Paper 1 , Additional Maths Paper 2 , and English for Science and Technology Paper 1... The Sej paper 1 was quite hard because the optional answers are almost the same...Hopefully I can get pass for Sej...For Add Maths , it is damn difficult for me...Was kinda confuse because the paper 1 was more difficult than paper 2...30% of the question I can`t do...There is no more chance for me to get an A for Add Maths this time...For EST , I was shocked because I thought paper 1 was suppose to be objective but it turned out to be structure and essay question...('-'ll)...Luckily I was able to do the paper with crap in it...    Well , I`m here to announced that she is getting back with her ex(I think...) and there is nothing I can do... I lost in the war without a battle... She doesn`t even need to choose to make a desicion...Maybe this is because I`m not someone that is important to her...Maybe I`m just a friend to her...A normal friend... Maybe I`m just a dot in her life...A dot that will not change anything...I remembered once she told me that she doesn`t have trust in her ex and thats why they broke up... But time changes everything...Now they have become better and her ex often come in our class and visit her... I feel kinda sad now... Not too sad... I can`t really concentrate in my studies... Thinking about things...This will sure affect my results of the exam this time... I think this is the end of the story... It turned out to be a sad ending...A really sad ending... I miss her but I think I should not contact her anymore...If now I were given a wish , I wish that I could have know her earlier...Maybe it will changes everything...Or maybe it will be still the same...Same ending... But who knows ? There is nothing much I can do now...All I can do is wish her for the best...And I`ll wait for her...   Current Music : Onitsuka Chihiro - Infection  Mood : Sad  : (
