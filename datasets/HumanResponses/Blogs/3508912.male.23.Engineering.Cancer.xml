      Ok, last night out of the anger and grieve for my cubs losing to the WHITE SUX, We decided to go to boat. Little did we know that this gamble would turn sour and fast. While waiting for the 10 dollar tables to dissapear and the 5 dollar tables to appear. I got bored and started gambling. Little did I know that it would be the worst night of my night. As I pull out my money, I see al (the polish punk) go to a more empty table and with him is eric and joe (the spectator). Of course, because I see my friends leaving the table or rather start gambling when I was the only one that wanted to gamble that this time, I join them.   1st bet: craps 2nd bet: craps 3rd bet: craps (do you see a trend here!!!!!) 4th bet: craps  Me, Al and Eric........Are completely out of money in 2 minutes and some change seconds. This is where we decide to make rules. Before we can make rules we have look at what we want to constraint.   With some and evaluation and we saw a couple things that we normally don't do when we gamble:      THINGS THAT WILL JINX US   1) We brought Joe. Even though this is absolutely, Eric lost 190 dollars, Al lost 90 dollars and I lost 100 dollars every time Joe comes with. Because he is a spectator, it unconsciously puts pressure on all of us to win. To prove in some way that gamble....Is A OK!!!  2) I drove to the casino. This one may be out there, but when I am going with multiple people, I usually don't drive and from now on, I only drive when Im the only one in the car.   3) No Korean music before the big gamble. Do I need explain this?!!!  4) NO empty tables. As much as it is cool to be the only one rolling that dice, you will lose your money faster. You can consider a lonely table like you can consider yourself dipped in blood and thrown into a shark pool. It's not good and you will get bitten.   5) No games before midnight. This may be the most controversial notation of them all because this only dictates the table amount. Before midnight, the amount is usually 10 dollars per table for craps but after midnight, it changes to 5 dollars. Low the table value, the more times you can play and ultimately make better adjustments.        THE OFFICIAL RULES:      Rule 1:   Don't bring Joe unless Joe is actually gambling (no minimum dollar amount is needed)    Rule 2:   Tomiya will not drive with a group greater than 1.     Rule 3:   No gambling will not be done before the clock strikes midnight unless you are willing the face the effects of your risk.     Rule 4:   No Korean Music will be played for amusement prior or after the gambling adventure.     Rule 5:   No empty tables will be played upon unless you are willing to take the risk.     Rule 6:   No whining for more money. You lose your money, you lose your money. You will not borrow money unless you are willing to take the 10% charge on all winning you can make from that amount borrowed and a 30% interest charge for being an idiot for borrowing more money and losing.     Rule 7:   No drinking prior to gambling. If drinking is done, must be done outside of the casino bars.    (optional) Rule 8:   Come to lose. You are going to play to lose instead of play to win. This way you won't be too disappointed.          Now go and use these rules and if you break one of the rules, then don't say I didn't warn you.   and you must say "Im a complete (Whatever your ethnicity is) Trash whore of a son to my mother and I should die from a death from killer african ants"

      people: Eric, Joe, Al, Tomiya  Destination: The Casino Boat  Objective: To make money biatch.  Intial amounts: (eric: 40, Joe: zero, Al: 20, Tomiya : 20)  Al joined the table with 20 bucks in his hands and a glimmer of hope in his heart.........Okay...so I lied alittle. He playing but the table was real cold and you couldn't put any streaks together eventually he lost his money and threw down another 20 bucks. For those of you who can't add...thats 40 bucks of total money. He does pretty good wins some here. Okay Now Im going to stop with his side of the story for now and concentrate on me and Eric.   I joined the same table at the same time (maybe 10 minutes late because the fucking dealers thought I was fucking 5 years old, I mean oh know I guess all those people who checked my ID before going into the casino were all wrong and the dealers can pick out those illegal kids who come in for a quickie) Im staying a float for a while, but eric is putting odds behind his bets and that persaudes me. Listen...The one thing I hate is when other poeple win and I don't. It's like a fucking cancer that eats away from my soul and I need to find some way to cure myself...so I mimic that winner. So in this case I mimiced eric........So I lose my money. I go to the ATM and pull out 20 more bucks (not to mention I get raped with service atm charges) so my total is now at 40 bucks. I playing and playing and eventually I did reach back up to comepletely even but that eventually changed and I was rather at lingerly at 20 bucks below even.....  Okay.....Now this is Eric's part. Eric is the type of person who plays the pass line. That's a common thing for Crap's players to play and of course he likes to put odds behind the more difficult numbers because of the better payout. There was this guy next to me who play something called the field. For all of you who don't know the field..it's a range of number (2,3,4,8,10,11,12) and if you put money on the field and the next roll of the dice is one of the these numbers...you put. If it's not...you lose..Simple huh? The probably is about 44% if you want to technical so about 50-50 chance. Eric is watching this guy next to him play the field and winning. (oh by the way, on the field you land on 2, or 12 you get double or triple to payout respectively). Okay ...back to story, so the guy is playing and winning on the field..this excites Eric and he starts playing the field. Bet number one....loss....Bet number two...loss....Bet number 3......WIN. Now I keep telling him not to play the field because you are betting way to fast and even though you can win alot of money, but you can also lose it fast. It's like saying I can one day FUCK BARBIE GIRL..the possibility is there, but also I'll probably won't. Keep this in mind. (Not the barbie girl...the field you stupid moron). So we weren't getting anywhere and eric is losing money so he pulls out another 20 bucks so he's up to 60 bucks...then he pulls 10 more bucks so his grand total for the night is 70 bucks. We aren't getting anything and eric has about 40 bucks in his hand (so he's down 30 bucks total). and then we see one guy playing craps by himself and we join this guy because we really wanted to roll the dice and so we go over there to play. Al joins us and all three of us are play in the table by ourselves....We will learn that this is the worst thing we have ever done ....in LIFE.    Al ------> goes up to 50 bucks profit at one time........LOSES IT ALL  Tomiya -----> loses all the money.....PULLS OUT ANOTHER 60 bucks..(WTF AM I THINKING!!!!!) so my grand total of pulling out money for the day is 100 bucks, but I end up stopping at 40 bucks so I lost only 60 bucks. ( yeah right only....you know what 60 bucks buys you at HB's......FUN!!!)  Eric ----> okay...this is going to long. Eric comes to the table with 40 bucks (the new table i mean)...plays the pass line and the FIELD. Bet 1...loss, bet 2...loss............BET 10 win, 11 win, 12 win...... Long story short...he starts to win and grows confident. Well....he first lost all 40.....pulls out 20 bucks...and then wins all of his money back so he's even for the day and NOW this is where we know there is a GOD and he made sure ERIC would know that. From 80 bucks.....he's makes more frequent visits to the field and he's also rolling the dice. He's got 30 bucks on the pass line (including odds) and he plays the field... 20 dollar bet ....and the ROLL......8. 20 dollar bet and the ROLL..........8 20 dollar bet and the roll..................6. "This is ridiculous....I know it's coming up" says the angry and frustated ERIC 20 dollar and the roll................7. Loses the field bet and loses the passline bet. Eric loses all of his money. Goes to the atm....pulls out 20 bucks. "ok...Im only going to make money til I get back to even"....plays the field....loses all the money faster than I sneezed...LITERALLY. Goes back the ATM pulls out money.....Makes a run, but loses money to....YOU GUESS IT!!!! THE FIELD!!!!. In the end he lost all of his money and Total amount of 140 dollars and in a 3 day span...he loses.....250 dollars.    oh yeah by the way....... me, eric and al are going back to the boat next week because we'll never learn.    this is why it's so OREGON TRAIL..........BUT NOT

      this weekend....some poor smuck of a jew celebrated his 21th birthday at a place where the bodies are heavenly and I have to say...that was a sure treat. Especially the fact that birthday fag boy got about 9 dances (1 horrific one and 8 nice ones) and all the alcohol he can drink. So what made this day good for Tomiya? I mean, it seems like Cunt-wad was getting all the fun. Well....this is where I explain....Barbie Girl. See Barbie girl is probably the culmination of everything you ever wanted in a girl. She's HOt....She's Hot...and She's got boobies...that are hot. People don't understand how many fucking times I can't go with my friends to Hb's and hear all the stories about how Barbie Girl enhances their life. Seriously....this isn't some ordinary girl...this is the type of girl that makes you look ar yourself in the mirror say...."I need to change my life and find a way to have this women". Ladies and Gentlemen...She's that hot. So Of course Im going to get a dance from her and it was 15 bucks well spent. Oh and then there this polish chick and my god.....the things she can do. I mean it's not like she's doing something different, but my god.....that is all.   This weekend then kicks off with Gambling. YES, If you are feeling down and need a pick me up....you go gambling. I play Craps and bringing only 20 bucks...I think I did pretty good for myself. But my gambling story doesn't even come close to the 3 other people who came with me on my gambling adventure:  1) Kev......  Kev gets hot and makes a ton of money and then makes Crazy bets and I mean Crazy bets and loses it all. But...it wasn't too bad since he started with 20 bucks. (high moment: 190 bucks) (low point: 0)  2) Eric......  Eric comes in with 40 bucks gets on the same role as makes about 100 bucks...pays the pass line and puts money on 6 and 9, but the table gets cold fast, but his agressiveness didn't die down, but in the end....loses it all. (high moment: +100) (low point: 0...maybe even NEGATIVE)  3) Al.......  Al comes with 20 bucks....makes a killing....about 100 plus. Goes through ups and downs, before he was going to cash out..he was at about 30 bucks or so.....takes that amount and puts it on the pass line. Of course Im like...HOLY SHIT...What da fuck are you doing? ...Here comes the roll.............SEVEN!!!! makes 30 bucks. Keeps his bet there....Second roll...........SEVEN!!! Keeps his bet there ..........Third Roll............OH MY FUCKING GOD...SEVEN. Keeps his bet there.......WHAT DA FUCK IS GOING ON....SEVEN!!!!! Makes 120 fucking dollars. Cashes out. Talk about Fucking Balls!!! High point (120 bucks) Low point: (15 bucks)   Me...I made 70 bucks......Tomiya 1 ...casino 0 (high moment: 100) (low point: Yo mama)

      Last night I the ending to one of the greatest things in sports is starting to come true. The Los Angelos Lakers are gonna be out of the playoffs making the Detroit pistons the 2004 NBA CHAMPIONS. It's not like I like the pistons, but I hate the lakers. I hate the lakers with every single bone in my body. I have no clue who I hate more....The New York Yankees or the Los Angelos Lakers. I mean atleast I don't mind watching the New York Yankees, as much as I hate them...they are a good ball club and nobody can say that they aren't. But the Los Angelos Lakers just suck. I mean I hate every single person on that team, I hate the management and I hate every single Lakers fan. And so.....Finally I'm getting what I want; to see the Lakers get knocked out of the playoffs once again and pretty much see a team that will never win another NBA CHAMPIONSHIP with these players. LAKERS BLOW. GO PISTONS. IM OUT.

      Ok...here we go. I've threw down the gauntlet and it's now your turn to see put down something that can top this.    Now here are rules: Give me the site of where the pic is or email it to   tomiya_adventures@hotmail.com  . If I decide it's a better picture. then I will update the post the with the new picture. That picture will then be replaced once a hotter picture is found. Now here is where you can decide to reverse my decision. If a picture is replaced and you don't like it, just go to the comments sections and/or email and give a shout out. If there is enough complaints....the picture will be reversed to the previous. Winner will recieve a Super Mystery Suprise Gift for winning. So here we go!!!!    Now of course this isn't the hottest picture I found. Why give up my trump cards? But I think this picture is adequate enough to be considered a hot picture. God!!! SHE's SO FINE!!!!! SERIOUSLY....THERE IS NO EXCUSE!!!!!    urlLink    There is No excuse for How Unbelievably Hot this girl is? Girls like this should never pay for anything in life EVER AGAIN! She looks so tasty!!!!!

      This is some cool shit. I was browsing through the internet and I found this on www.milkandcookies.com. It's about a guy walking into a building (maybe gang members) and just destroying them into pieces with a gun and samurai sword. So if you like cartoon goriness then give this a shout. It's not bad.   If you have a High end pc, press the Q button in the flash for higher resolution if not...just don't do anything. Low resolution is on default.    urlLink    MADNESS COMBAT!!!!!

      Thats right!!!! If you're a guy, it is your obligation to watch some sports tonight. It doesn't mean you have to watch the whole game, but I would like you watch atleast 5 minutes worth. If you don't I then know and so does everyone else in this world know....you are gay. We have the NBA FINALS. and Of course if you are a baseball fan...pretty much every baseball team will be playing including my cubs. So Watch something tonight for a change. ITS GOOD FOR YOU.    Also: Babe Challenge will begin in a day or so. The delay is caused because I have been a little busy than usual.   AIGHT...IM OUT.

      Hey sorry about not updating the site in the past day. These couple of days have been a hard for me to update and site and do other things. Not to mention I was pissed off last night about the fact that I was scheduled to work and there was a conflict in the schedule and I didnt work. I hate it when I'm scheduled to do something and things don't go your way. It's the most annoying feeling the world and I needed to work that day because I kinda needed the money. Also after I found out I couldn't work....someone said the dumbest thing to me and I just out of anger, I couldn't write because I would of said what's on my mind and bad things could happen.       And Al.......I know you are the one putting those comments on my site you damn trailor trash white boy of a friend. You are gay! You are gayer than gay. You makes those midgets on this page look cool. So Die! I hope you die from a pool of African Killer Ants. And by the way.....your hockey....it blows. Ok...Bye bye VOYTEK!!!!!!!! Good luck in your challenge....HOPE YOU DIE OF OVER EATING. HAHAHAAHAHAHA YA DAMN JEW

      Oh man do I have something to show you!!!!! When I was at work yesterday, I found a guidebook on my manager's table and so I picked it up and started laughing. It's a guidebook on how to treat "little people". It's pretty much a book on what accessories midget's have when you go into a hotel room. They have extention sticks, midget robes (called "dwarf robes"), and stepping ladder. This book also giving you directions on how to approach midgets and how not to use "short jokes". This is amazing that I have found this book and it's amazing that they have a midget guide book.    urlLink    HAHAHA.... MIDGETS!!!!!   urlLink    Here's page 2 and 3.   The best part is hands down the section on "understanding dwarfism". I mean THERE IS A TERM NOW??!!!! That is crazy. First they were called midgets then the PI thing is "little people" and now its dwarfism. Why don't you fucking call them hobbits from now on. WOW....this is just truly unbelievable.

      I'm at work right now and it's a strange time to be at work. Normally work is fine, even though from time to time I am overly frustrated and annoyed with the people I encounter at work (I mean the customers), but nothing too bad. What's really bothering me at work is that one of my managers is in one of the room trying to get her damn network setting off and running on her laptop. So I can't bust out my Laptop and do my own stuff. First off, I offered to fix the damn thing another time and I would give her my pc card I used to use when I had this Shitty laptop. But she's still trying to get it to work by herself and it's taking her like 80 hours because she's doing the whole thing by dial up. What is up with that? That is MEGA GAY! I should of just done it for her in like 10 seconds. Grrr...so thats is why I can't update my site with normal weird stuff or with stuff about hot chicks.   Oh yeah....it's going to be Al's birthday on Monday or Tuesday? I don't know...that damn jew can't make up this damn mind. But anywayz...He turns 21 ...so that means he is legally allowed to drink. What does that mean?   It means he's going to get a taste of "HOT BITCH"    Oh yeah I can't wait...I need to sneak a video camera in to the place so I can broadcast "hot bitch" to the world. Oh ...if you are curious who this "hot bitch" is......imagine a dog....with a wig on. That's "hot bitch". Well....actually "hot bitch" is this 45 year old asian dancer who thinks she's the hottest women in the world when actually she makes everyone barf and she thinks that arm pits are a big turn on for guys......one of my buddies experience an arm pit greeting....LOL!!!....wow....I can't explain how that must felt. I guess it's just the demographic...maybe some guys are into that. As for me?...Im into that Next door nikki girl. Seriously...can you find a hotter chick? The fact that she looks like your next door neighbor is what makes her hot because then the reality of you actually boning a normal person like that sinks it.      I think one guy quote something really funny about next door nikki: "If I was a tenacle monster, I would fuck her in every orface at the same time"     I think this quote just sums up how hot she really is or how really fucked up the quote is, but when I read it...I was on the ground laughing. But, we are getting away from the subject at hand. I am DAMN work and I can't talk to my friends online or do other things. Im stuck on this damn Work computer which blows chunks and is slow as hell. What a waste of time. What the hell am I going to do for 8 hours? Work?.....I work at night...you know how many customers I get.....like 5. Well....Im out!    Oh Btw....if you guys have any ideas or suggestions to tomiya adventures. Email them to tomiya_adventures @hotmail.com . Or if you want to send in a Hot Chick pic for that Babe Challenge go right ahead. I did tell you that whoever gets a better picture than the other posted as best will recieve a prize....NO JOKE....its a mystery special super surprise...so that should get your heart pumping.   BOOYAH   IM OUT.

      Monday will mark the one week aniversary of the tomiya adventures and I feel the viewers can make an impact in one area of the show if they choose to. I will put a picture of a super hot babe up. Now if you know of a hotter babe, then you can submit it to the site's email address or leave the address in the comment area. If I think you have a better picture it will be replaced and put on the site. No super hardcore stuff....I don't need some random 8 yr old kid browsing the net and seeing a girl get quadruple by her brothers or something. Keep it PG-13 or R...  No MEGA XXX      urlLink    Who Shall Win?   I have not decided to make this a weekly thing or just this one time. We'll have to see. More info later.

      Today, I am going encounter something I don't usually do.....I'm mowing the freaking lawn. If you can account that for the past 2 weeks, the chicagoland area was anything but sunny. It rained and it rained and it rained....thus, the grass is pretty much up to my knees if I don't cut the damn grass.....Let's say Im screwed. There are some problems that I'm having with this TEMPLE of GRASS adventure...first off...my mower seems to have a dull blade. I kicked the machine atleast a couple of times because of anger and not to mention I have the Sun coming down on me and I'm one lazy dude and I don't wanna do it. I don't get any satisfaction or reward for doing this horrific duty. I don't get any food, or money or some hot ass 34C beautiful naked women waiting for me in the shower.    preferably the girl showed below:     urlLink    "Thank You....GOD"   This is pretty much the girl I need to marry. Imagine...Just imagine waking up and seeing that on the couch. I think my life would be complete and I could die a happy man right there and then. Only thing better is her in a school girl outfit.    oh wait.....This will do:   urlLink    "oh Tomiya!!!!, You have conquered the TEMPLE OF GRASS!!!! Devour me!!!"  Oh...its times like this I wish I was a BILLIONAIRE.

      Since Tomiya wants to talk about boobs today....lets talk about Lindsay Lohan's Boobs. This Hot and volumptous young women has been springing up lately on television and in motion picture and THANK GOD. What's really funny is that her acting career aint gonna go anywhere without her boobs. Those precious cushions are the stepping stone she's gonna need to a good career in movies (Porno or Non). It sure isnt gonna be her intellect nor will be her acting thats gonna take her far. And you know what....more power to ya. I say if you need to use your body to get some hook ups and "influence a couple people" then  ITS YOUR AMERICAN DUTY   to do so. With girls like Lindsay Lohan and her wonderful boobs, the world would be a smaller place where OMISH girls rule the land....and we dont want that now.   SHES HOT and more importantly.....  she turns 18 on july 2  . Early B-day present to me....I think so !!!!!!!! Not to mention her cans are plump and juicy. This is the future. Enjoy it in whatever way you choose.   Oh and one more thing....if you have ever or know someone that has tapped that.....CLAP CLAP CLAP. You need to be on a poster or something.   here's a clip where she shows off her talents and I dont mean acting.   urlLink SNL CLIP !!! MEGA HOT!!       urlLink    LINDSAY LOHAN ....GOOD JOB....JUST RIGHT....... Nice and Juicy

So I go in for my interview and I meet with the human resources lady. She goes over the company, benefits and my job. She mentions how its a networking job and gives my the exact position:

      well....the day has finally come....Im getting a interview today for a 9-5 job. Yes...can you believe it? But Im kinda sad....I don't I will be doing what I spend 4 years in college training for....   Well..its not like I really applied...the guy who was a guest at the hotel for quite some time wanted to hire me and when I said my field was engineering...he tried to find something in that field. I kept stress circuits, programs....CIRCUITS, but I don't know if he understands that. The only thing that registers in his brain is I can fix computers. I don't know exactly what I will be doing but it seems like IT stuff (information Technology)...thats like server stuff, networking and fixing computer problems. I don't know what that pays...I looked up monster.com salaries and a networking engineer and something under IT....it said 40K but Its highly unlikely that&nbsp;Ill be getting that much. So that is why Im sad...not because im getting a better job...but because its not what I want to do with my life. I guess we will see....   The other thing that is bothering me is that I told the guy that i have little experience networking...I mean yeah...I know all the TCP/IP stuff and i can set up a network...but mainframes and stuff like that...um.....NO. I know programming, I know circuits, I know RF analysis...I know computer system architecture, but everything I learned is theorectical.......so im a little scared I dont know SHIT about what they want. The guy is like...LIE!!!   He wants me to say&nbsp;that I can do it even though he knows I have little experience maybe because he thinks&nbsp;they can train me and everyone there is&nbsp;stupid as hell. I don't know..Im fucking&nbsp;scared to death. Well....I have to go and sleep for this interview...   the guy im getting the interview from is MR. DAS.&nbsp;whats cool is that the guy&nbsp;who is getting me this job opportunity is mr. das's&nbsp;boss. He and his employees&nbsp;who is also mr. das's other boss is giving me advice on how to handle this interview...like what to say etc etc etc. and they pretty much prep. me up.&nbsp;I know what you are thinking....he if this guy is the boss why don't you just get the job automatically...well company policy is that&nbsp;each division head makes personally&nbsp;hirings. So he can't&nbsp;even though he is hire up.   well..Im&nbsp;out. IM going to try and sleep but I don't think I will&nbsp;sleep much. Grrrr.&nbsp;Better pull out that suit..(cobwebs all over it..LOL)&nbsp;

      Okay...so I sent it my resume to some guy that works at AKORN. inc and he's a regular guest at the hotel that I work at. He wanted me to send in my resume and yesterday he says he will try to get one of his employees to hire me. He's trying to get me a job in computers but I think he really wants to do sales and I HATE CUSTOMERS!!!!! IF a certain group of people need to die..its customers. SO GAY!!!!  But anyways...I talked to the guy yesterday and he says he will try to get me an interview this week, but he wanted me to send my resume to this certain guy first ( the actual guy who may be hiring me). SO...I email him and he replies " thanks tom. We may have opportunites in the future". Dude......what the fuck does future mean? Because the other guy is like stressing at me to send in my resume and he wants to get me this job and this other guy is saying some future shit. What da!!! I mean I could be utterly wrong and taken this job waiting process a little too serious, but I just worried that I have to wait a long time.&nbsp;I mean atleast say something like...Okay tom...we'll hire you, but you can't start until october or september or some shit. Then I could get ready with everything.........  GOD I HATE WAITING...please god...please....I need a job. Tom lee doesn't want to be lazy because I sick and tired of being broke all the time. Im sick of it!!!! I can't stand it so much. I love going to school and all and I want my masters, but this me being broke....blows!!!!

      wow...just wow....today I dodge the a bullet...NO I DODGE A GATLING GUN AIM RIGHT AT ME AND WITH NO ROOM TO DODGE....NOT ONCE...TWICE!!!!. Okay..lets start from the beginning:  Me and Al end up going to casino one day earlier...I guess I was worried that there are no more 5 dollar tables availabe since the last time we went, there were only 10 dollar tables. So End up pulling money out...because I had made alittle bit more this week, but Fucking they fucked up!!! and they paid me a little less, but I dont care..because I will get my money because...damn it...ITS MY FUCKING MONEY!! So me and Al went to the boat and this time we are lucky because there were 5 dollar tables. So throw down my money and Im like "lets partyyyyyyy!!!!!"....well after a few good rolls..things went sour and fast. In fact, I was actually down to 10 bucks. 10 bucks people!!!!! thats -50 bucks...unbelievable. So I made a plee with GOD and said "Please if I make this money back, Im leaving" And GOD saved me....unbelievable, but a few rolls...I came back up to 60 bucks ..INFACT...i passed it. But I got greedy and Im like "IM HOT BITCH...LETS ROLL" and I don't know how...But I kept on losing. Why? or How did I lose? because everything I bet...turn to poop. Literally.. I mean...5 dollar on passline and POOF!!! POO showed up. and they had to clean the poop stain off the table before going on. I mean this was unbeliavable how unlucky I was and I knew god was torturing me. and so I had like 10 bucks left ...again and AL is like "put it on the field!!!! DO IT!!!! DO IT !!!! NOW!!!!!! LETS GO HOME!!!! OMG RUSSIA 2k4!!!".   THIS IS WHEN....THE GRANDMA COMES:   You know how they say GOD WORKS IN MISTERIOUS WAYS. God was the grandma. and guess what ...she's rolling.   roll: 1 ~~~~~10 ....ALL FIELDS...YES FIELDS....how many times did i take advantage...twice. FUCKING BULLSHIT!!!!!  then I pull out a secret technique...chanting!! When the first number is done...I keep throw my fingers out there to equal that number...example...four...I chant..FOUR FOUR and have 2 fingers out on each hand.  so whats my total: 20 bucks at this point.  grandma rolls: 6, I chant 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 ............................roll 6 grandma rolls 5,&nbsp; I chant 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ............................roll 5 grandma rolls 9,&nbsp; I chant 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 ..............................DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND!!!  ...I MADE MY MONEY BACK..............YES SHE MADE ME 60 bucks and EVEN...thats 8 ROLLS RIGHT....UNBELIEVABLE.  Im at 70 when she's done, up 10 and so I put away that 60 bucks and play with my 10 bucks. Then my fever roll comes out....THIS ROLL IS MEANT FOR LEGENDS...ONE DAY I SHALL BE THE ONE&nbsp;PEOPLE CALL LEGEND. THE FEVER ROLL ...WORKS AND EVERYONE HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY................casino......fucking pissed like hell. DAMN RIGHT BITCH.....you fuck with GOD...YOU PAY!!!  PARTY 2k4!!! .......................i left the casino up 30 bucks....BATTLE OF THE CENTURY!!! I WIN.

      Well....This week is now officially done. and What a fucking week it has been. Besides having a roller coaster ride with my money and the boat; Hopefully very soon, I will be able to give my stupid Nissan Maxima to my friend Joe since he will be helping me out with whole car payment situation thing I am in right. Im going to need Dave's help on this one since the mother fucker won't pick up his damn cell phone and I fucking left like a million messages to him. This just seriously makes me sick, but hopefully very soon the car is out of his hands....since he's like NOT PAYING.   Well....just for kicks. His name is Leo Voorheis. and the supposed addresss that was given was  &nbsp; 1076 N. Cardinal Dr.  palatine, Il &nbsp; so if anyone wants to ruin his life for me.....(im not saying in any way to do so, but for your amusement)....go right ahead. Just don't scratch the car though because the car is mine and I need that car back in one piece. Help me out and I don't know.......you will be ever engraved into the tomiya adventures book for years to come.   Dave......I hope you found something good for me. If you get my car back....I will pay for your next 2-3 trips to the boat.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- besides that:  hopefully TOMIYA will be a job. What? What did I say? ....Job? Who me? Yep...you heard it straight from the gook himself. I just did my entire resume over since I really had a chance to look at it and I realized that I was missing alot of info and I didn't elaborate on my experience. Also I didn't write a cover letter because I was really lazy and this whole car thing put me in utter shock for the past year and a half. So Im going to get my butt in motion and get a real job. Yes.....Good bye Marriott....Good bye free downloads....Good bye to doing whatever the fuck I want.   oh yeah....if and when I do get a real job. If any of you fuckers out here needs a job and is willing to work 11pm to 7am on Friday and saturday nights (these days may change) then....holla at the comments section. The job pays about 80 a night...after taxes.....and you do nothing . In fact tonight....I ate 4 candy bars, watched a porno, a movie and Im writing this damn blog. Not to mention Im downloading:  MY WIFE IS A GANGSTER and MY WIFE IS A GANGSTER 2.   so PEACE OUT. Till next time.    TOMIYA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      now that I have tried the new age method. I have to know whether or not I can be consistent with this method. I don't want to win alot of money one night and then lose it another night.   my method has 2 fucking huge holes:  1) the first roll: obviously this is the huge mystery. You want any number in the whole fucking world but 7 and 11. 11 is a 1 in 16 chance while seven is more of a easier number to obtain. Seven is the most probably number in the group. You can do things to insure that you won't take such a huge hit on the first roll and that is....put a dollar or 2 on 11 and any seven. These bets may help you ease the loss, but at what cost? wasting dollars left and right will just add up in the end.   2) the table needs to be hot:  This method has 2 sure things: even though we are putting money on the don't pass, we are playing to win. The last thing I want to do is ruin the mood of the table. but just like the pass line: if&nbsp;the table is cold as fuck then you aren't gonna win much.   so keeping this at mind, Eric, al and I went to the casino to try out method. We followed all the rules and when we got there, there were noooo 5 dollar tables at the time. Well this sucks, we follow all the rules, but we may have to break one rule ...the 10 dollar table rule. At first we are thinking to wait, but how long can we really wait? If there are alot of people, I don't think the casino is gonna be lower the wages on tables any time soon. So ended up playing blackjack, I just played on game of blackjack at the 15 dollar tables....and of course I lost. Eric also played black jack, but he used all 40 of his money. Al also joined, but he had early success and left the table up 35.   So as we are leaving the table, I am telling Eric and Al (well...actually just Al because Eric blew his money) to go play the 10 dollar tables, but this time...we put 10 bucks on don't pass and 15 bucks on pass line (12 bucks if the number 6,8) this way its like we are still playing the 5 dollar tables. In the beginning, I thought I should lead by example: so I put 10 bucks on don't pass.  Roll 7 .........SHIT Roll 7 .........SHIT Roll 7 .........SHIT.......................THIS IS THE DOWN SIDE TO THE METHOD.  so IM already down 45 bucks. and then Al joined in and we started have bad luck...but we weren't losing 10 bucks from the first roll, we were losing 5 bucks from second roll..which is better, but still sucks. Then the table got somewhat hot and I made 30 of my 45 back. While that is happening, Al let eric borrow that 35 bucks and he used that on black jack and lost. Then al made some money off the method and gave that to eric (only 15 bucks) and eric ...lost that. So Eric is down and me and al are just pretty much idle. We do win sometimes and we makes like 13 to 11 bucks everytime we win, but we would then lose the next 2 times. Its a horrible cycle. Well..the table went south real fast, but I didn't properly move to another table which i should of done and eric found a 5 dollar table that just opened up. So I go to the 5 dollar table with 40 bucks. This table was real bad for me because I kept losing my money on the first roll....this guy was nuts...I met 4 people in a roll that atleast roll a 7 or 11 2 twice...thats 20 bucks right there...and then after than they would crap out.  this is wear I should of stuck to my method, but I ended up FOLLOWING ERIC's advice. he was like...this table is cold you should just be playing the don't pass. I was doubting my technique and I change to don't pass....  THANKS ERIC............I lost all my money...Al....made money.   Al was low on money and he did was every person would do....take a desperate risk....THE FIELD. Luckily...he made all his losses back from the field by making THE MOST CRAZY BETS...20 bucks at a time!!!!   As for eric.....he had 20 bucks on his Credit card...cashed it out and played the 6.8.   this is where it got interesting. This is his technique:  you play the 6,8---------> 6 bucks a piece ( so thats 12 bucks total)  you put 4 bucks the hard ways......so now we are at 16 bucks on the table.   and thats it. you dont play the pass line, you don't play the don't pass. thats all you play. If you hit a 6 or 8. You press and then if you win again..you cash out and start the process over.   he got sooo fucking lucky on his first bet and not crap out because that would of been 16/20 bucks he pulled out and the table didn't get hot, but it got IDLE where the shooter doesn't win, but doesn't lose. ERIC WON 100 + paid al off and made himself 20 bucks.  LIFE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!  But i guess you have to try the method again. THE METHOD DIDN"T FAIL.........I DID. I didn't move to another table or the table was just too cold. its the same as just playing the pass line..I would of still lost. BUT GOD DOES IT FEEL HORRIBLE TO BE EVEN.

      listen....Im sick and tired of the ODDS. Im sick and tired of putting my money down and seeing some loser fucking roll me a seven and lose 10 bucks. So as I was back at the Boat, I found a new technique that may satisfy everyone. It's not fool proof , but it may satisfy many people. This methodolity is all about RISK. What at we risking? Im sorry, but...I dont like to put 5 bucks on the pass line and then 5 or 10 bucks on the odds. thats a 10 or 15 dollar risk. Yes...I know the payout make be worth it, but what if you lose.   If a man has 500,000 dollars and he's like man....Maybe I should put on odds. I mean..it might pay me 2:1...should i do it? Of course not. Are you fucking mad? Yes. you might win and make money, but you are in RISK of losing it. thats the biggest reason of depression. People are sad because they had a huge bet and they fell short. So...this is my plan.   Don't pass -------------> put 5 bucks pass line -------------->  pass line --------------->put 10 bucks behind and 12 bucks behind when the number is 6,8 &nbsp; why do this because you are playing total odds, but if you win on the odds...you make a bigger and i mean bigger payout then just 5 bucks and if you lose...you lose only 5 bucks for every scenario. What does this bring? This brings more opportunities of play. that means you don't waste all your money on large bet. just follow the formula and as long as the shooter is not getting sevens on the first roll...then you are taking the SAME RISK, but depending on the number you can make anywhere from 10 to 18 bucks profit. Just think about that...if you just play the pass line and put 5 bucks on just the pass line....you make 5 bucks and you may lose 5 bucks. This way...you make 10 to 18 bucks but you will only lose 5 bucks. This is a great plan. But once again....it all depends on the first roll. If you have a table that wins only on the first roll...then you lose 5 bucks and then if you they crap out on the second roll...thats 5 more bucks...thats only down side. but if&nbsp;it works out well..you can make good money. I know because i make 120 using this method. It works. It's not perfect, but I still like the fact that RISK is minimized.   here is chart.   for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6,8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5,9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -------- D pss&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;  pss&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 loss&nbsp;if crap&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5  win ( net profit)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  these are pretty interesting numbers and&nbsp;they need a 7 or 11&nbsp;for you to lose on initial roll...that means 77.77% of the time...you shouldn't lose your money.&nbsp;But....seven is the easiest number to get ...occuring 16% of the time. So to counter act...you may want to put 2 dollar any seven&nbsp;or something, but thats&nbsp;up to you. also if you think the guy won't do it and you are unsure.   put 5 bucks on the don't pass and 5 on the odds. this is a EVEN-WIN situation. If you win, you get even money on 6,8&nbsp;make 2 bucks profit on 5,9 and make 5 bucks profit on&nbsp;4,10 but if you crap out...you lose nothing.&nbsp;what ever works.   just remember it won't work all the time.&nbsp;You have to pick&nbsp;your shots.  WELL GOOD LUCK. Oh btw the...if the casino bans this technique from casinos.....I want people to remember it&nbsp;as     THE TOMIYA TECHNIQUE       &nbsp;

      so.....the last place i was at...i was up about 70 bucks or something like that. So Im like...."shoot, im hot. I need to go and play again and run this hot streak"  so&nbsp;I go to the casino because I was bored and I nothing else to do. The table I went to was okay and I didn't really win or lose. I did have some good throws and I ended up 30 bucks. Since I was up 30 bucks from my profit money (I was playing with the 70 I won the other night), I played a little more aggressive and that's expected. What did I have to lose? I wasn't playing with my money. After a few rolls....Mentally I made up my mine. I should quit even. that way, I can go and play another day. So as Im walking to the cashier's desk. I go and see what all this comotion is about that another craps table. This craps table was 10 dollar table. So Im like..why not? It won't hurt me and I do win a few but I end up losing all 70. So Im pissed that I made the wrong move, but Im like "i can make it back ...I know i can"&nbsp;&nbsp; So this point GOD save me once.   so I pull out a 100 bucks and I get on the wrong foot and lose 40 then I make 60 bucks. So now GOD SAVE ME TWICE. But ...I ended up losing that and so I was at 20 bucks. And this guy comes to table and I get my money back...I end up at 100 bucks. I mean its not fully back, but GOD SAVE ME THREE TIMES!!! and what do I do...............  BLOW IT ALL AWAY.   ITS LIKE........THAT FAMILY GUY&nbsp;EP. where PETER falls off the house and SPIDERMAN saves him and peter is like "awww thanx spiderman"...Spiderman says "everybody has one" and spins his web away.   well.....SPIDERMAN save me three times. He ain't gonna save him four times.   FUCK DUDE!!!! FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      So I get this called from one of my friend...whom of which I haven't talked to in a while other than instant messenger. He was in Elgin doing a stakeout. He was observing this girl for past few hours (I asked him if the girl was hot...he said..all girls he observed throughout his short new career were ugly). So all you people out there who want to be a PI and did it for ladies.....um....get another job. Anyways, while he was in the area, he wanted to go to the casino since he never went to the boat before. So I end up going with him and at first we play black jack because there were 15 dollar black jack tables available. Well..let me first say because it saturday at about 3:00 pm, I was prediction much activity in the boat. I mean it's the weekends and usually on the weekends the tables cost more. So ended up bring a hundred dollars with me. It did not mean in any way that i was gonna use all 100 dollars, but I pulled it out of a NON-bank one atm machine and the since the atm free is one flat fee, I pulled out more money. Well..after a couple games of black jack, I finally got him to move to the craps table. Just when we got there, some guy just started his roll and he did the craziest thing I ever saw. He just didn't lose, I mean he was perfect and because of him I made a good 100 bucks and Dave made about the same amount. As for the shooter, he got every number on 4,5,6,8,9,10 and so he won CRAPS FOR CASH ...a 4 grand pot. Then he took put 400 dollars on the hard ways...the rolled hard numbers 4 times and won....another 4 grand. Yes this man..won 8 grand.   as for us...the table got cold, went to another table but loss all our profit, but Dave had a good run with the dice and won 70 bucks for me and then I chose to stop. I came back to the table to see how well dave was doing. The shooter was this asain guy who had to piss and so he tried to lose on purpose and as he is trying to lose: he is winning and winning alot of money. It's kind of ironic, but I didn't pull out money and thus, I didn't take advantage of this.   so that was day one. So in perpective, this week at the casino has been good for me...I have made 150 bucks. So I felt that I was in a Hot streak. So Sunday rolls by and Im thinking ..wait a minute, I should go back and not let this streak end...WRONG MOVE and I shall explain what happened later.   IM OUT and I NEED TO SLEEP.

      This is the story of how dreams can come true. Of course when I say dreams come true, it's everyone else's and not mine. Now This story begins yesterday night as I make my weekly campaign at the boat. There were $5 dollar tables this time and the table was pretty good. You made your money when the opportunity strikes. Then this guy comes...has all these tattoos on his arms and he was pretty wasted. Proabably brought a 100 bucks with him and then it begins:  starts his roll:  Puts money on Hard 8 (55 bucks), Hard 4 (35 bucks), Hard 6 (35 bucks)   first roll: 6 second roll: Hard 8   (makes 495 bucks) 1080        roll: Hard 4   (makes 245 bucks)        roll: Hard 4   (makes 245 bucks)        roll: Hard 4   (makes 245 bucks)  roll, and roll and roll...nothing  then....Roll......hard 6 makes (245 bucks)  New roll: .......HARD 8 ....(makes 495 bucks)  Then he decides to put 120 dollars on hard 8.   3 rolls later.....HARD 8......Makes 1080 bucks.  so in total...this lucky ass mother fucker brings 100 bucks to the table and makes a WHOPPING 3050 bucks on 1 SET OF ROLLS. NO BUST!!!! UNFUCKENBELIEVABLE.   oh by way, I didn't ride the hard ways bandwagon and so I lost money through all this.   in the end, I won 80 bucks, But ....it just aint fair.

So, Im like shit, this must those damn bill collectors. So I don't pick up the phone because Im just sick of tired of talking to people who are gay. So I just listen the message they leave on my voicemail. When I was listening to the message, I realize it was one of my co-workers at work saying that she can't make it to work tonight and see needs me to cover. This is where Im like..........WHAT!!!!!???? OKAY!!!! FINE!!!! I mean it's not like it's a bad thing, I do absolutely nothing at work. In fact, Im typing this right now at work. I mean...it's nice to have another 80 bucks in my pocket for just sitting on my ass doing like an hour of total while watching a movie, but I wanted it off and now I won't have another day off til saturday (OMG!!! MEGA SUPER PARTY END OF THE WORLD BLAST!!!! LIVE YOUR DREAMS PARTY OMG 2k4 BLOW OUT!!!)

      So there am I am at the hotel, sitting in the back chilling and Im like "shit...my stomach is crapping up...must be those 7-11 poor boy subs and nachos". So Im getting ready to go to the bathroom when all of sudden these 2 girls come to the front desk and they are like:  Lady: " okay....Im lost. Can you help us out and find where we are staying"  and all Im thinking is....get lost, go screw some guy you whore. I need to go the bathroom bad!! and so im like "fine!!!"  and these are clues they gave me:  1) they had a marriott hotels and resorts room card 2) their room is on the 7th floor. 3) something about deerfield rd.  okay..right off the bat, I call the nearest hotel...the marriott resort and of course they don't have her on file. So Im like okay....listen.  It can't be a courtyard because we dont have any keys that have the marriot resorts and hotels room card and you can cancel EVERY HOTEL IN THE WORLD thats a courtyard. And all the courtyard within a 15 mile radius go up the third floor which then just salidifies my reason.  and so I say " was your hotel near a highway" they say " yes ". and I said "There only one hotel that matches everything you said and thats the deerfield suites which is a marriott property, its the ONLY HOTEL THATS 8 stories within a block radius 10 miles and you said something about deerfield.  and they are like " no..it can't be...thats impossible. I heard it was on Deerfield Rd. " and All im thinking in my head is...you fucking bitch, are you seriously that dumb. I mean you are seriously only good for fucking and leaving on the side. And so for like 15 minutes Im telling these ladies to go there and that I bet my fucking dick and left nut that this is your hotel and they still woudn't go. For God sakes....you asked for my help...I helped you, I need to take the biggest dump EVER!!! and this whore is keeping me from my objective. And finally...they believed me when I called that hotel and verified multiple people staying there.  NEXT TIME YOU FUCKING DOUBLE ANAL DOUBLE VAGINA WHORES go to a hotel and forget what hotel you are staying, I won't give a shit and you better find some lonely homeless guy to fuck so you can sleep in this cardboard box.  Luckily.....I they left, I took my dump....The world is in order.

      okay...seriously.....I hate how there are wedding parties at hotels and what sucks even more is that this stupid god damn hotel promotes these parties but doesn't allow noise in the hotel. Doesn't that defeat the reason for having a wedding party all checking in to the hotel. I mean I do I go the hotdog stand to order ribeye steaks....I mean CMON!!!! Why am I so mad? Because Im sick and tired of the noise complaints that I keep getting week in and week out...Just shup the fuck up you stupid dumb whore!!!!! Fucking I can sleep through noise...so can you!!! so Fuck off.
