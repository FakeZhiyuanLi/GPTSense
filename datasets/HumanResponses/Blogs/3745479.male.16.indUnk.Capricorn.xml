      Read from bottom to top:   My response:  Mr. hillbilly, your name fits you well.  Funny you say our Presidential candidate is lame, when yours was the worst President we've had to date regarding foreign relations, economy, environment, and possibly more.  It's funny how you don't realize that the "average joe" was screwed over by Bush's tax cuts.  It's funny how you don't realize that 2 million "average joe" jobs were lost in his first 2 years of presidency.  Also, not everyone on welfare can help it.  When will you Republicans realize it?  Not everyone was blessed with a good marriage with two hard working parents.  Not everyone was "blessed" with white skin color (although it does make some cocky--I'm half white/ half asian so you don't think I'm just saying this from an exclusively minority point of view).  Some of the people on welfare have 2 or 3 jobs and still can't support their family you insensitive hillbilly.    Also, we're not pulling out of Iraq, and John Kerry doesn't want to either.  We will still have our troops there so that the IRAQIS can govern, not Americans.  It's not our land.  You say that your elders fought in wars.   Funny thing is, YOUR president skipped National Guard duty (the administration won't release his military records....hmmmm...see link http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/news/special_packages/8986429.htm ), while John Kerry was a decorated war veteran from Vietnam. Enough talk already.  It seems like you and your President need to enlist in the army and get some "backbone".     hosshillbilly  IP: Logged Posted: 06/25 10:26p ET     This film is proof that the liberal left will stop at nothing to sway the weak minded passive American people into electing another lame president. If they suceed then they can marry their dogs and cats or anything else they want to with no reprecussions from the government. The average working stiff Joe can pay all the bills for their social welfare programs that cater to those that are to lazy to get a job. We can pull out of Iraq and set back and wonder just when the next attack will come from, or where it may be, or whose family may be there. Everyone will be a part of the Great U.S. of Rainbow Stew, and a chicken in every pot. I just wish that America had the same BACKBONE it had when my Great-Great-Grandfather fought with the 2nd Mississippi Infantry, or when his Great-Grandfather fought the British during the Revolutionary War, or when my uncle carried a malaria ridden soldier 22 miles in the Phillipines during WWII. People better WAKE up and figure out that there ARE NO FREE RIDES!

      I find this very interesting, and he's probably right:   Recon  IP: Logged Posted: 06/26 1:23p ET     I saw the movie yesterday morning...sure it was slanted but for the most part I do think it was factual.  I knew when Bush ran for President how it would be.  I am from an Oil Company background and could see the deck being stacked....Condi Rice...(Chevron Board of Directors), Dick Cheney(Halliburton), GW (Harken Oil Co.)and Daddy Bush (Carlyle investment group).  Now I'll so some forecasting for you...from now on to election in November...oil prices will drop, street prices for gas will drop and why?  Because the Saudi's have already agreed with their investment partner GW and Daddy Bush thats the way they will help to keep their Good Ole Boys in office doing the AWL Bidness.  There will be spikes and valleys but you will be paying less for gallon of gas by election time.

      I think it's hilarious that Republicans are making a movie called, "Michael Moore Hates America".  It just goes to prove what Democrats have been saying.  Before, you were labeled as a Communist for speaking out.  Now, you're labeled as someone who supports terror.  Republicans are so ignorant and close-minded (regarding discussion and freedom of speech) that it's funny.  It's also so funny that they don't realize they will be screwing themselves over if they make this movie because it's so over the top and proves the Democrats right.

      This was an exchange on KATV between me ("Low_noon") and "Highnoon".  Remember, read from the bottom up, because that's the order of the comments.     Low_noon  IP: Logged Posted: 06/26 12:51p ET     Highnoon, you amuse me, you closeminded southern baptist.  You should move to Mississippi.  Protecting the environment is not important? Protecting the Constitution is not important? Stopping racism is not important? Being diplomatic instead of war mongering is not important? Being fair not only to the rich, but middle class and lower is not important?   Protecting freedom of speech is not important?  Using your logic, then you're as guilty as Bush for sending thousands to their deaths in Iraq, including Iraqis whom I'm sure you don't care much for.  "We are protecting you from the wrath of God you Stupid people! "  Yes, and I'm sure God approves of your profanity and your name calling.  You don't know God.  If you did, you wouldn't support a President who lied about the war, had the Supreme Court elect him (8/9 justices appointed by Republicans), screwed the middle and lower class, screwed the environment: http://www.nrdc.org/bushrecord/ , etc. etc.  And yes, there are Democrats who don't support abortion or gay marriage.  You see, unlike the Republican party, Democrats allow a wide range of people with a wide range of opinions.  We won't shoot down our own (like Dick Cheney did to some Republicans) for questioning our actions or dissenting.  That explains why we had 9 candidates running for President.  You, sir, are a blind sheep.  You will follow Bush to the end, no matter how many mistakes he makes.  You will hate Democrats until the end, no matter how much better of a President they can be (Clinton).  The world hates Bush, and loved Clinton.  Bush has no diplomatic skills.    Surprisingly, people like you only come from the South, the bible belt South.  Coincidentally (or not), education is lower in the south than the northeast, racism is higher, etc.       Highnoon  IP: Logged Posted: 06/26 12:29p ET     YOU people must put things most important first and least important last. What you think is important is BS. You should know that if you support a party that kills babies the womb and lets queers get married you are just as guilty as those people that are doing it!   We will not support any damn party that does that even if the feds go bankrupt and no one has a job. We are protecting you from the wrath of God you Stupid people!

      It's amazing that people can even compare Bush to Clinton.  Clinton was obviously the better President.  An interesting thing to note is that Reagan had a lower approval rating than Clinton on their last day of presidency.  Where was Clinton better than Bush?  1) Foreign policy-  Europeans, Asians, Middle Easterners, etc. all had better relations with America in those days. Now, with the betrayal of the UNITED NATIONS, people feel we have betrayed the world.  The "police" of the world was corrupt because it could not be policed.  If another country issued a pre-emptive strike, America and allies could stop it, other countries can not stop our imperialism.  2)  Environment-  So many thing come to mind.  Such as Bush not signing the Kyoto treaty to reduce Green house emissions.  For the ignorant out there, more pollution= less ozone = different temperatures.  Different temperatures = differ rent growing seasons = different weather conditions (such as the major drought in the west, el nino, la nina, etc.).  It's the balance of life and nature that is disrupted when we over-pollute.  Bush edited the EPA's summary by taking out global warming and saying that global warming has not been scientifically proven to the outrage of scientists.  The list goes on and on, click link: http://www.nrdc.org/bushrecord/  3)Freedom of Speech-  He hasn't allowed it.  People who speak out are now considered "unpatriotic".  This makes us no longer a Democracy, but an Empire.  Bush might as well be our king.  4) Polarization of people, ideas, etc.-  The divide amongst Americans is greater than ever.  "You're either with us, or against us."  "You're either good, or evil."  5)Economy-  THE ECONOMY IS GREAT.....in INDIA.  Sure we've gained jobs in the U.S. over the past months...but we've still lost over 1 million jobs since he took presidency.  Clinton, in contrast, added over 25 million jobs.

      If you scroll to the top of this page, you'll see ads that say "Buy Bush 2004 campaign buttons".  Why, on my liberal site, would I have these types of ads?  Obviously, I did not choose to have them.  I think it has to do with the fact that I use the phrase "George W. Bush" so often in my criticism of him that the Google ad system thinks I'm pro-Bush!  Well, from now on, I will refer to George as George Bu$h.  And, just so that my ads go toward John Kerry, I will make a paragraph devoted exclusively for him.    Elect John Kerry 2004! Elect John Kerry 2004! Elect John Kerry 2004! Elect John Kerry 2004! Elect John Kerry 2004! Elect John Kerry 2004! Elect John Kerry 2004! Elect John Kerry 2004! Elect John Kerry 2004!

      By the time I get to my blog, I'm always tired from arguing with idiotic Arkansans at the KATV forums.  Here's a comment section to an article called: "Mixed reactions to Fahrenheit 9/11".  The comments at the top are the most recent, while the comments at the bottom are older.  My account names are: "MyLastAccountWasDeleted" (because it was at one point...long story about censorship), "Low_noon", and "StopStereotyping."  I have multiple accounts because they only let you post once.  Sadly, I can't respond to the idiot named Texas Rigg who stereotyped all Muslims.  He apparently didn't read any of my post about how the KKK uses the bible for their causes.  What an idiot.  Ignorant people = George W's core vote.  Comments at KATV:       Viewer Comments on Mixed Reactions to 'Fahrenheit 9/11'      texasrigg  IP: Logged Posted: 06/25 2:14p     Stopstereotyping...............For your information within the last 90 to 120 days, after the members of this "peaceful" as you put it religion had blown up a road block, there were unexploded shells containing sarin and mustard gases. This was reported on ABC,NBC,CBS, FOX,CNN,and CNN Headline News.  Sure this is a small incident, but it doesn't take much of these to kill thousands.  If you don't think these are weapons of mass destruction, ask a chemical engineer or a high school chemistry teacher, or better yet ask a vetern of WWII, Korea, Vietnam, or the first Gulf War.  How much evidence do you people need?  Oh, and by the way I DON"T listen to Rush or any of those talk radio or tv talk show people.  As far as this fat @#$ that made this movie.  If you don't think he is a liar, that is out for number one. Then look at the scene in Bowling for Colombine where he went into the bank and made a deposit and got a gun.  It was shown on all three major(ABC,CBS,NBC) news channels as to be a total lie, and even this liar admitted that the way he showed it wasn't exactly correct.  What else has he lied about, or better yet, what has he said that has been true and the proof that it is true.  Will I see the movie????????? Nope, I don't like to waste money       StopStereotyping  IP: Logged Posted: 06/25 1:15p     Preacher jak, I've studied Islam and it's a PEACEFUL religion.  (I compared the Bible to the Quran, and they are very similar, almost as if the Quran paraphrases the whole bible).  It's just that some items can be taken out of context, much like any religious text.  For example, the KKK uses the bible for their racist causes.    I find it despicable that a preacher, like yourself (I'm assuming), would ever make a stereotypical comment like that.  It just goes to prove your ignorance of other cultures.  It reminds me of when my mother, a Filipino (Philippines) catholic, introduced herself to her coworkers for the first time when we moved to Arkansas.  An idiotic coworker yelled, "FILIPINOS ARE NOT SAVED."  People like you and this woman are out of touch with reality and have no diplomatic/social skills whatsoever.  I hope you don't breed hate in your church as well.   Oh, and regarding your comment about chemicals.  If it were true that we found chemical RECENTLY (not in the first gulf war), then Fox News, a Republican news channel, would be touting it all over the airwaves.  "Wake up America. We cannot allow anyone to come here go anywhere else that have intentions of converting the world to their way of thinking by force. Just keep your head in the sand and remain passive long enough and you too may be bowing toward Mecca someday. "  That's funny that you say that.  I'm assuming that you disagree with the actions taken by the Conquistadors who subjugated millions of people and killed those who did not convert to Christianity, right? I guess this would mean your against Christian ministers who try to convert people of other religions too.       stormnutt  IP: Logged Posted: 06/25 10:38a     i know i am opening my self up for some insults, but i don't care. i am going to see this movie tonight. don't be fooled that we went to iraq for terrorism. we went there for oil. if bush really wanted to fight terrorism he should focus more on Osama Bi Laden and Saudi Arabia for that matter. i have always voted republician, but not this time or ever again. i honestly don't know if Kerry will be any better. because i for one have lost all hope in our government, but i feel like i will be casting my vote for the lesser of the two evils.       preacherjak  IP: Logged Posted: 06/25 9:04a     If any of you think for one minet that there is not a cause in our troops being in Iraq you are dreaming. The Islam religion preaches and teaches HATE. Some from this forum might fit in well with their aggenda. I challenge you to study this form of religious brain washing for yourselves, dont take my word for it, then you can make an educated decision on whether or not we should be there. Past history proves that Islam has always been a tool used by criminaly minded men to keep all other races and women under subjection by force if necessary.They have the same intentions for any nation that would be free and have been proving that for the past 4000 years. Some of you people make comments based on ignorance and it shows. Why is it so hard to remember that the NATO troops have already found several thousand shells that were designed to deliver chemicals? Wake up America. We cannot allow anyone to come here go anywhere else that have intentions of converting the world to their way of thinking by force. Just keep your head in the sand and remain passive long enough and you too may be bowing toward Mecca someday.       liberaldude  IP: Logged Posted: 06/25 7:33a     Good job, mylastaccountwasdeleted.  People should also remember that we invaded Iraq, they didn't invade us.  What's next for our brave President?  Grenada?  No, wait.  Another great Republican invaded that despicable country.       Low_noon  IP: Logged Posted: 06/24 11:47p     Ah, now I remember why I got this name, Highnoon.  Let's break down your comment:  "Making a movie for political reasons is not a movie. It's the lowest form of politicing there is."  Let's see what the dictionary says: "mov·ie   A sequence of photographs projected onto a screen with sufficient rapidity as to create the illusion of motion and continuity."  Well, it appears that a series of several fast-moving photographs determines a movie.  Oh my gosh! Who would have thought!? Fahreinheit 9/11 is a movie!  "The democratic party is full of scum that always floats to the top. Crazy people who let their ass do their thinking for them."    Well, at least the Republican party has respectable, kind, and courteous characters like yourself and Rush Limbaugh.  People who don't resort to name-calling or use profanity like, for example (just off the top of my head): "ass".    Republicans would never do anything like that because that's just plain hypocritical! Right?       Highnoon  IP: Logged Posted: 06/24 11:33p     Making a movie for political reasons is not a movie. It's the lowest form of politicing there is.  The democratic party is full of scum that always floats to the top. Crazy people who let their ass do their thinking for them.       MyLastAccountWasDeleted  IP: Logged Posted: 06/24 11:29p     After being lead through a war based on false pretenses, squandering a surplus and creating a deficit, and harming the environment, I think it's about time that we learn about the truth about President Bush's various policies.  This movie is not "unpatriotic" or unfounded propaganda.  In fact, JDCurtis, Michael Moore uses legitimate sources for all of his claims, such as the 9/11 commission report.  An interesting thing to note is that Michael Moore attacked Bill Clinton when he was President as well as the current President.  This obviously shows his attacks are not directed completely at one party, it's just that Republicans generally want it censored whenever it happens to them.  Are you saying Bush has done a good job on the war on terror?  Then why have so many of his aides who deal with national security resigned because of his "lack of action"?    Also, let's not forget the thousands of Iraqis who were killed during this war and how their public opinion has become increasingly negative of America. Sure, they're not Americans, but they're human beings none-the-less.   If all Iraq had was sand, we wouldn't be there.  If this war was truly about WMDs (like it was originally), then we would have gone after the country that has outright broken international nuclear treaties: North Korea.  (By the way, my brother is serving in the army---we support the troops, but not the administration).  Let's face it: the issue for you is not whether what he says is true or not (because he uses legitimate sources, such as the 9/11 commission reports).  Let's get to the REAL reason why don't want to watch it, JDCurtis: because it goes challenges your leader's policies.    I'm sorry, did I interrupt your Fox News viewing?       chas14  IP: Logged Posted: 06/24 11:14p     Moore is the next thing to a traitor and subversive.  Anyone who gives credence to his drivel deserves to be expelled from the human race.  Yes, I vote conservative Republican -- usually somewhere to the right of Ghengis Kahn.       JDCurtis  IP: Logged Posted: 06/24 7:28p     Wow gizzmo0, you are calling Michael Moore INDEPENDENT!!!  Where have you been my friend?  This guy is a died in the wool West Coast Liberal who has loudly declared himself to be a Bush HATER.  Mr Moore has one thing in mind and that is to destroy the character of George W. Bush.  Everyone who is not a "Yellow Dog Democrat" (as you have shown yourself to be) will understand his underlying motives and will reject the notion that truth is a part of this liberal fantasy.  Speaking of GUTS... Mr Bush has shown, by his confrontation and destruction of radical Islamics (who murdered almost 3,000 of your fellow countrymen), that he is the one with GUTS.  Based upon what I have heard and read it is easy for me to say I will not view such TRASH.       LRTony27  IP: Logged Posted: 06/24 7:13p     People are worried TOO much about this movie.  Or in "W"'s case, maybe not enough.  The people who want to see this movie...will.  Those who don't....will wait for the DVD.  I can't wait to see it.  It's time we saw the lies and deception coming out of the White House for exactley what they are.  No more white-washing.  Moore may be a egomaniac, but he has the cajones to tell things as HE sees it.     This growing sentiment of "if you're not for us, your against us" is getting old, IMO.  I am tired of being called UNpatriotic because I dont support the war.  I support our men and women over there 100X, HOWEVER, this war was a sham on SO many different levels...but not supporting the war doesnt make me a turncoat Benjamin Arnold...that is why America is so great.  We have the option to voice our opinion and SAY when we dont agree with something.  I, for one, say GOOD FOR MICHAEL MOORE!!!!       gizzmo0  IP: Logged Posted: 06/24 6:34p     I would go see, just to see the other side of Mr.Bush. I mean we only get to see what the news wants us to see. Now we got a independant person viewing the truth about our goverment. That takes guts! Im sure that some if bush voters would like to put this movie down, simple the fact it puts him down. If the truth hurts, than dont watch it.

      Guys, i just found out that I'll be living on the 3rd floor of the residential life building!  My roomate is a Muslim too: Mohammad Atiq!  This will call for interesting discussions.  I'm sure the guy is intelligent and it will be awsome learning about his views on the world today.  I have a feeling he'll be smarter than me, which is kind of good.  (I'll try harder if he's smarter.)  I told the ASMSA people during my interview that I would like to be paired with a focused, smart student.  Which of course, isn't necessarily true all the time... but yeah... i hope i'm not outdone too badly.

      Article by the AP:  By SAM HANANEL, Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON - A watchdog group says it will file a complaint with federal election officials, accusing two conservative organizations of illegally helping Ralph Nader's presidential campaign, possibly with support from President Bush's re-election campaign.  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington planned to file its complaint Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission. It says the Oregon Family Council and Citizens for a Sound Economy violated election laws last week by telephoning people and urging them to help Nader get on Oregon's ballot in November.  Spokesmen for both groups denied wrongdoing.  Both groups acknowledge trying to influence Nader's petition drive Saturday in Oregon, in hopes that getting him on the ballot would take votes away from Democrat John Kerry and help Bush win the battleground state.  But Melanie Sloan, the watchdog group's executive director, said Tuesday that the conservative organizations are also corporations that are prohibited by election law from making campaign donations.  Sloan said she also would name the Nader and Bush campaigns in her complaint because of reports that some Bush-Cheney volunteers may have made similar calls from Bush campaign offices.  "If Bush-Cheney was soliciting those corporations to assist the Nader campaign, then that's a violation," she said.

       Later this week, I'll address some comments by certain people about me....you know who you are.   Here's excerpts from an Interesting Thread at the arkansasrockers.com messageboard.  Irrelavent posts were taken out:  that guy  309 Posts 	 Posted - 06/27/2004 :  11:19:33 PM      Fahrenheit 911 playing in 1/4 of the theatres that the other top 5 movies played in this weekend. Per screen this was one of the biggest opening weekends in history.    NickdelaFresh  45 Posts 	 Posted - 06/28/2004 :  2:15:43 PM        Since I´ve been in Buenos Aires, which has been about 5 weeks, I´ve probably gotten more questions about Michael Moore than anything else. People here generally aren´t too fond of the US and tend to have a very high opinion of him. That wouldn´t really bother me, except that the man rarely checks his facts. In fact, CNN ran a story yesterday on this exact subject. I hope I wasn´t the only person in this city watching that program. For the people that speak english here, I send them to this website http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html I don´t dislike Moore for his views, which I often agree with, but rather for his practice of presenting lies as truth. I find it rather sad that someone would use fiction to make Bush look bad when it´s quite clear that using the truth is not only easier, but much more effective as well. This post just cost me 40 centavos. Here´s a story about a person that Michael Moore could learn a lot from: http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/206424p-178119c.html   bemuse  667 Posts 	 Posted - 06/28/2004 :  3:15:16 PM        moore has said himself that he is NOT a documentary film maker. his movies are his opinion, and sometimes sheer propaganda.  i for one am glad to have someone from a more liberal side slinging the propaganda instead of it just being fox news.  i ignored the parts of the film i felt were a little too skewed but listen to the facts (yes there are several) and question what is going on.    shermer IL  165 Posts 	 Posted - 06/29/2004 :  03:33:26 AM            quote:Originally posted by NickdelaFresh      That wouldn´t really bother me, except that the man rarely checks his facts.

Here´s a story about a person that Michael Moore could learn a lot from: http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/206424p-178119c.html     moore's facts are not in question. it's his analysis of them that can be debated. he uses the best fact checkers in the world including the finest from The New Yorker. Most people that have a problem with his facts are those that come up with an idea that they believe moore is trying to convey and often is never even mentioned. In his four highly controversial books there has not been a single lawsuit. This man knows his facts.  from 911 the right only wishes to discuss the bin laden's being flown out of the u.s. they seem to think that moore makes a claim that they were allowed to fly during the 2 day grounding period. i saw the movie. he never makes that claim. his point was, "why weren't they questioned?" "why fly them out after a terrorist strike, when ossama is the #1 terrorist in the world?" the screen clearly shows 9/13 on the day of their flights. not once does moore say they were allowed to fly prior to 9/13. this movie has it's fact correct. although there is little that is new. everything outside of the censored military records is fairly easy info to obtain...and very easy to prove. that may be why moore fails in this movie. he wanted only things that were easily proved. i've seen most everything moore has done and i've been a fan since his days with Mother Jones going back almost 20 years. However, this movie was by far his worst effort. It's unfortuante that more people will see this than all of his otherworks combined.   shermer IL  165 Posts 	 Posted - 06/29/2004 :  04:11:30 AM      if you want shotty fact checking go see bill o'rielly. the man claims to have won 2 peabodys. only he didn't. not one.  Example 1: In an April 27 radio debate with a Canadian journalist, you threatened to lead a boycott of Canadian goods if Canada didn't deport two American military deserters, saying that a previous O'Reilly-led boycott of French goods cost that country billions in lost export business. You cited the Paris Business Review as your source for those losses.  In fact, Media Matters found no evidence that a Paris Business Review even exists, and France's export business with the U.S. actually increased during the run-up to the Iraq war.  Example 2: In discrediting philanthropist and John Kerry supporter George Soros, you distorted his account of his feelings about his father's death, deliberately misquo ting him from a 1995 New Yorker article to make it appear that he had callous disregard for his father's life.  Example 3: On May 4, in announcing his acquisition of a cable TV channel, Al Gore said: "This is not going to be a liberal network or a Democratic network or a political network in any way, shape or form."  On "The O'Reilly Factor" that night, you said: "Al Gore has announced that he is starting up a new cable channel exclusively devoted to liberal stuff. We wish Mr. Gore good luck. And he'll need it."   that guy  309 Posts 	 Posted - 06/29/2004 :  1:23:50 PM      i disagree with your opinion on how good this film is, but you've got the right idea about the attacks on moore's conveyance about 9/13. here's straight from the horses mouth info.  -----------------------------------------------------------  The Press Attacks Fahrenheit 9/11: Can Newsweek's Michael Isikoff be Believed? by Craig Unger  In "Under the Hot Lights," Michael Isikoff (link) attacks Fahrenheit 9/11 by asserting that "Craig Unger appears, claiming that bin Laden family members were never interviewed by the FBI." The article then goes on to say that this assertion is false.  Unfortunately for Isikoff, I make no such statement in the movie. I do report--accurately-- that the bin Ladens and other Saudis were whisked out of the country without being subjected to a serious investigation. But that sequence ends with Michael Moore summing up my account of the bin Laden evacuation. "So a little interview, check the passport, what else?" he asks. "Nothing," I respond.  It would be one thing if Isikoff had simply made an honest error; but clearly that is not the case. When Isikoff called me for his article, I specifically told him that the evacuation process involved brief interviews of the bin Ladens which fell far short of the kind of intense criminal investigation that should have gotten underway after the murder of nearly 3,000 people. Instead, he attributes claims to me that are simply not in the movie.  Isikoff also wrongly asserts that the Saudi "flights didn't begin until September 14--after airspace reopened." In fact, as I report in House of Bush, House of Saud, the first flight took place on September 13, when restrictions on private planes were still in place. I even gave Isikoff the names of two men who were on that flight-- Dan Grossi and Manuel Perez-- and told him how to get in touch with them. According to the St. Petersburg Times(see below), the September 13 flight from Tampa, Florida to Lexington, Kentucky, has finally been corroborated by authorities at Tampa International Airport--even though the White House, the FBI and the FBI repeatedly denied that any such flights took place. Commercial planes began flying again that day, but private aviation was still prohibited-- and three planes that violated it were forced down by American military aircraft. I explained this to Isikoff, and wrote about it in my book. But Newsweek's response below ignores the fact that these restrictions were still operative. If the evacuation of the Saudis was entirely legitimate, as Newsweek contends, why would the Saudis bother to seek special authorization for it from a crisis-stricken White House-- an undisputed fact that has been corroborated by the Saudis and Richard Clarke? The central undeniable fact is that in the aftermath of this great crime, material witnesses were authorized by the White House to leave the country. But Isikoff left that out--and much more. In dismissing the Bush-Saudi ties, he even omits the fact that more than $1.4 billion in investments and contracts went from the House of Saud to companies in which the Bushes and Cheney have been key figures-- all of which is itemized in my book.   tildoh  568 Posts 	 Posted - 06/29/2004 :  8:39:17 PM            quote:Originally posted by shermer IL         On "The O'Reilly Factor" that night, you said: "Al Gore has announced that he is starting up a new cable channel exclusively devoted to liberal stuff.

"After seeing all the numbers, all the exit polls and surveys they do of people coming to see it, it was clear to me that a lot of people in this country want some questions answered and are unhappy about what's going on," Moore told PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley.

      Hey guys, I've been busy getting ready for finals at National Park Community College.  If you're wondering, I'm taking college trigonometry at NPCC.  It's the hardest ****ing subject I've ever taken.  Basically here's how it works:  8:00 AM wake up 9:00ish AM arrive at NPCC a few minutes late, go through the scrutiny of opening the classroom door, having the teacher's lecture stopped, then going to sit down while everyone watches 9:00ish AM - 10:50 AM Get introduced to whole new concepts very vaguely, and get told to learn all the concepts you don't understand on your own time.  The instructor skips over half of the new formulas and concepts and tells you what pages to study over.  Lots of ground covered in a short time.  Everyone else has had high school trig except for me, so get my ass handed to me every other question when I don't know the answer.  Most students in college, others past their 40s (Mrs. Warford was one of the over 40's--7th grade lakeside school math teacher) 11:00 AM arrive home 11:45 Eat lunch 12:30 Sleep until 4:00 PM to make up lost sleep from previous night 4:00---  Pretty much anything I feel like from here on out: studying, tv, reading...etc.

      I'll write an entry more thorough a little later tonight.  Right now I'm dead tired (just got back from Little Rock).   Brandon Thrash brought up a good point that not only Republicans lie, but Democrats do as well.  That's true, to an extent.  I'm not going to dive into the topic now...but let's be fair to some politicians also.  Not ALL Democrats and even Republicans go into politics to make it rich, to get away with scandals, etc...lol...  There are some that ACTUALLY want to help America and ACTUALLY want to lead  America in a positive direction.  He said "vote Nader" 2004.  I would totally support Nader (my mom did last election---big mistake) if he actually had a chance.  The majority of Nader voters come from the Democratic party members who see little difference between the present-day Democratic party and present-day Republican party.  When Nader voters of 2000 supported Nader....it turned out to be a big mistake.  If Gore would have some of those Nader votes, he would have undoubtedly won.  (In turn, the tax cuts for the rich, the anti-environment policies, and the failed war in Iraq would never have happened).    Voting for Nader is like telling your friends, "I'll jump off the bridge if you jump of the bridge."  You're afraid what will happen if you (prospective Nader voter) jump off the bridge (vote for Nader) and your friends (other prospective Nader voters) don't follow  >>.  Thus, if you really want to start a third party, it has to be basically something short of a revolution to force that many voters to change their party simultaneously.  Not all Democrats voted for Nader, in part because they didn't agree with him, and in part because they were afraid Bush would win (or at least be in the position for the Supreme Court to declare him a winner).  Besides, the nation is more polarized than ever, especially after Bush.  Bush pleased the Christian right with his support of an Anti-gay marriage amendment and his faith-based-charity initiatve.  He pissed off most of the rest of  the world   with his policies (failing to sign the Kyoto Treaty, the war on Iraq, etc.)  I can't believe I went into that much detail.  Anyways, I'll probably talk about cynicism more in depth later......

      ----- Dick Cheney told Democratic Senator Leahy (a very calm man by nature) to, "Go fuck yourself" while in a Senate meeting on C-Span.  The FCC fined Bono (lead singer of U2) hundreds of thousands of dollars for saying "fuck" on tv....the question is: will they fine the vice president for saying, "go fuck yourself"?     Answer:  Of course not, it's run by a group of hypocritical Republicans willing to bust liberal Bono, but not their VICE FUCKING PRESIDENT.  ------The Bush reelection campaign has put a video on their site comparing Democrats, such as Al Gore, to Hitler.  This is unprecedented for an Official campaign site of a major party.  The videos were taken from the liberal MoveOn.org, so apparently the Republicans thought they were justified in putting the Hitler videos up.  WRONG.  Moveon.org IMMEDIATELY took down the videos for the content.  The video was sent in for a contest, not by the ACTUAL MoveOn organization.  The Moveon organization was disgusted when they saw it and immediately took it down.  Plus, that was an organization, not the official Democratic party.  In contrast, the official Republican party is showing this video comparing Democrats to Hitler.  They must be nervous if they're resorting to this type of stuff so early in the game.    Later in the video, they show John Kerry saying the "ass" word.  Funny thing is, Bush called a New York times reporter a "major-league asshole" during his 2000 campaign.    Motherfuckers (sorry, getting the hang of it from my friend Dick...Cheney)  ------That Illinois senator because he told his wife to fuck him in front of other people in sex clubs (excuse the language, Dick Cheney is intoxicating me....sort of like how Bush was arrested for DUI when he was intoxicated).

      I won't go in an in-depth article about it tonight (reserving it for a later time).  But check out these comments about the gay pride march in Conway (at KATV.com).

(The last paragraph was sarcasm for those that didn't catch it.  The rest was true.)    [I added this comment at KATV with  "highnoon_"  name in good fun]    As "Highnoon_"     hooooooo doggy.

      Just debated with a kid named Jeremy.  Easiest debate ever.  You know you're winning when someone starts calling you names  because he knows he doesn't have substance for his arguments.  Chances are he'll continue being judgemental, hypocritical, and a self-proclaimed Christian living in Arkansas.  I feel sorry for..........................................Arkansas.  It doesn't need anymore people like that. (This kid goes to church several times per week?)  From AOL Instant messenger (Jeremy's Screen Name was taken out).   Jeremy:  ok Jeremy:  you pick the topic johnnydr87: bush's military service johnnydr87: did he serve? Jeremy:  no johnnydr87: then, why does he attack kerry's war credentials Jeremy:  how bout we debate something besides political Jeremy:  lets debate on Gay marrages johnnydr87: ok johnnydr87: i'm for gay marriage Jeremy:  i am against johnnydr87: in the 1970s most people were against interracial marriage johnnydr87: that means no kevin johnnydr87: no me johnnydr87: no dd johnnydr87: no michael johnnydr87: roughly the same percentage is against gay marriage today Jeremy:  are you gay johnnydr87: why shouldn't gays be allowed to marry johnnydr87: no johnnydr87: but i hate homophobes Jeremy:  because it is not the way God created it to be johnnydr87: some people can't help it if they're gay Jeremy:  yes they can johnnydr87: people don't "choose' to be gay johnnydr87: is the kevin? johnnydr87: or jeremy Jeremy:  God made adam and eve not adam and steve johnnydr87: can i bring up the cousin topic johnnydr87: kev's cousin? johnnydr87: is that a phrase your brainwashed with at your church johnnydr87: you're* johnnydr87: who are the people primarily against gays? christians Jeremy:  straight people johnnydr87: who were the people primarily against interracial marriage? christian johnnydr87: that's not true Jeremy:  i think you're a queer johnnydr87: i think you're an overweight fag johnnydr87: and homophobe Jeremy:  yes i am homophobe johnnydr87: and war monger johnnydr87: and redneck Jeremy:  are you a homophobe Jeremy:  ? johnnydr87: nope Jeremy:  well then you dont mind getting butt raped by a gay dude at asmsa johnnydr87: hah. johnnydr87: that's the conservative christian mentality johnnydr87: don't understand johnnydr87: nor do you care to understand Jeremy:  your a christian johnnydr87: but not a conservative johnnydr87: sort of like when you support Bush for going to a war on false pretenses Jeremy:  do you read the bible johnnydr87: yes, apparently polygamy was in style back then? johnnydr87: i wonder why we can't have multiple wives now johnnydr87:   Jeremy:  do u belive in what the bible says Jeremy:  ? johnnydr87: not all of it johnnydr87: a lot of it just ISN'T possible johnnydr87: like noah's ark johnnydr87: and some of it contradicts itself johnnydr87: just like all holy texts Jeremy:  give me an example of it contradicting himself johnnydr87: but the debates shouldn't even contain christianity johnnydr87: the U.S. is not all Christian johnnydr87: there are muslims johnnydr87: jews johnnydr87: buddhists johnnydr87: etc. Jeremy:  youre a jew queer johnnydr87: you're an ignorant redneck johnnydr87: and that's no lie. Jeremy:  because i live how the bible tells me too Jeremy:  gay people are going to hell johnnydr87: it johnnydr87: it's so strange...how the education level is lower in the south, the racism level is higher....but so is the jesus level johnnydr87: i wonder if there's a correlation between bible thumpers and education level johnnydr87: probably so Jeremy:  do you believe that god made the bibile johnnydr87: south= bible belt= lowest educational scores Jeremy:  not made the bible johnnydr87: north= seperation of church in state= higher education levels Jeremy:  but was the reason behind it johnnydr87: that's not even an issue to debate about, like i said, not everyone is a christian in the united states Jeremy:  but the two of us having this debate are johnnydr87: but that was the point Jeremy:  do you believe that god created adam? johnnydr87: to debate in politics johnnydr87: nope. Jeremy:  why not? johnnydr87: I believe in evolution, because i've read both sides johnnydr87: i'm not a christian who will just denounce evolution johnnydr87: because the bible says "adam and eve" johnnydr87: i'm going to read up on my choices. Jeremy:  now how do you figure that a man came from a monkey johnnydr87: evolution. Jeremy:  wheres the evidence johnnydr87: you know, we share 96% of the same dna as monkeys johnnydr87: its not that far fetched of an idea johnnydr87: its everywhere johnnydr87: have you even heard of any? obviously not johnnydr87: because you're brainwashed johnnydr87: ever heard of the galapagos islands? johnnydr87: that's where darwin studied evolution johnnydr87: animals evolved differently on the island than on south america johnnydr87: because of seperation from the mainland Jeremy:  that called micro evolution Jeremy:  which i believe in johnnydr87: hah Jeremy:  wat does micro mean johnnydr87: so you believe in evolution, but you don't Jeremy:  little johnnydr87: on smaller scale, obviously Jeremy:  therefore its more of an adaptation than a evolution johnnydr87: no it's not johnnydr87: there skin colors changed johnnydr87: their physical features johnnydr87: thats not adaptation Jeremy:  if i moved to alaska rite now my body would have to adapt Jeremy:  micro evolution johnnydr87: adaptation is a racoon from the wild getting used to living in a city johnnydr87: it wouldn't adapt johnnydr87: you'd where warmer cloths johnnydr87: there's a difference Jeremy:  eventually you would adapt Jeremy:  but Jeremy:  if you were a type of hunter and you learned how to hu8nt something in a new land it would be adaptation, not eveloution johnnydr87: ok there was a phone call johnnydr87: i'be back johnnydr87: i'm* johnnydr87: dude johnnydr87: evolution is totally different johnnydr87: than adaptation Jeremy:  brb johnnydr87: evolution changes physical features Jeremy:  gotta use the broom Jeremy:  b-room johnnydr87: after years and years of adaptation johnnydr87: ok johnnydr87: adaptation is immediate, evolution is gradual Jeremy:  the Bible says that God created the universe and every living thing, so the world must have been created. In denying this we call God a liar. And so you can see how evolution theory undermines the omniscience and even the existence of God. And if there is no God, why not do our own thing? Or if God is not all-knowing, indeed, a liar, why put our trust in Him? Evolution theory logically leads to these humanistic ideas. Christians must take a stand for the Word of God, or be accountable on that judgment day for the souls of those whom we did not warn. Jeremy:  Measurements of the sediment deposited as a result of Nile's flooding each year leads to the conclusion of an earth under 30,000 years old. Considering a few larger than normal overflows would place the age of the earth close to the biblical account Jeremy:  The sun's diameter is shrinking at the rate of five feet per hour. At this rate, life could not have existed on the earth 100,000 years ago. johnnydr87: i never denied god existed johnnydr87: are you saying you believe in noah's ark johnnydr87: i'm sure god created the earth, that's not an issue Jeremy:  yes i do johnnydr87: so, god took two of each animals Jeremy:  yes i do belive in noah's ark Jeremy:  yes johnnydr87: you know how many species there are? Jeremy:  no do you johnnydr87: yeah, i did, let me look it up johnnydr87: it was several million johnnydr87: one sec. Jeremy:  Meteoritic dust falls on the earth continuously, adding up to thousands, if not millions, of tons of dust per year. Realizing this, and knowing that the moon also had meteoritic dust piling up for what they thought was millions of years, N.A.S.A. scientists were worried that the first lunar ship that landed would sink into the many feet of dust which should have accumulated. However, only about one-eight of an inch of dust was found, indicating a young moon.  Meteoritic material contributes nickel to the oceans. Taking the amount of nickel in the oceans and the supply from meteoritic dust yields an age figure for the earth of just several thousand years, not the millions (or billions) expressed by evolutionists. This, and the lack of meteoritic dust piles on the earth, lend to the belief in a young earth.  johnnydr87: stop copying and pasting johnnydr87: and one sec johnnydr87: still looking Jeremy:  im not Jeremy:  f u queer johnnydr87: isn't lying against the bible? johnnydr87: or profanity Previous message was not received by KCC7324 because of error: User KCC7324 is not available.  Jeremy:  i am not lying Jeremy:  loser johnnydr87: i c you're quick to dish out insults johnnydr87: like god would wan it johnnydr87: you're such a hypocrite johnnydr87: you disgust me Jeremy:  i hope you have fun at asms with all your queer friends johnnydr87: you love god so much johnnydr87: but you're also quick to condemn and/or insult people johnnydr87: the christian way Jeremy:  go get raped at asmsa johnnydr87: there you go again johnnydr87: republicans = hypocrites johnnydr87: hey guess what, dick cheney's daughter is a lesbian johnnydr87: and that's a fact johnnydr87: i guess she's burning in hell when she dies Jeremy:  democrat=you=fag johnnydr87: would you agree?

      Today, I went to an ASMSA gettogether by Mrs. Campo.  Her son is going to ASMSA also so she invited other ASMSA students from around the area.  Only 5 came.  It was ok...a little bit a waste of time.  My dad didn't come because he's a teacher and didn't think he needed to go (he thought it was for ASMSA info about dorms and such).  It was really awkward as well being crammed between the parents and having to lean back whenever they talked.  Eventually I moved over to talk with her son (for some reason I forgot his name).   It was interesting.  The thing that sucks is that the other 3 students knew each other already from their previous school, so they just stuck together on the other side of the table and didn't converse with us.  Cool: there will be a girl named Jennifer Wu coming to ASMSA this year and she was the NATIONAL JEOPARDY (SP?) CHAMPION.  Genius.  Amazing.

Previous message was not received by loveseat2005 because of error: User loveseat2005 is not available.   Upon further research, it does seem that humans (in gods image) came after animals.  When god made them in his own image, does that mean he changed ape-like creatures into what are now known as humans? Making humans in his own image comes after the passage about bringing in creatures.  Nobody knows the time span for one day for God because that's relative.  A day to him could be 1 million years, or even 1 second...we'll never know. Here's the passages of interest (note how humans in his own image comes AFTER the creatures):    # And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. # And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. # And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. # And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. # And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. # And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. # And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. # And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.   I'm not saying I'm right, nor am I saying I'm wrong.  It's a mystery who's right.  And like I've said time and time again, YOUR interpretation might be different than mine.  I will always believe proven science as an affirmation of the bible while YOU might consider it at odds with the bible.  And stop with the hostility already because I have a different opinion.  People in America have different opinions, as well as the rest of the world, get over it.

      Just before I go to sleep, a quick post:  Science and religion often seem to be at odds.  Why is that?  There is no plausible reason.  Today, I watched a documentary on PBS about Galileo and what he was subjected  to by the Inquisition for his observations (such as the Earth was not the center of the Universe and that the Earth revolved around the sun) which seemed to differ with what the Bible said.     In his rebuttal to the Inquisition, Galileo said that the scriptures are absolutely right, and that science only affirms what the Bible says.  When proven science is at odds with the Bible, usually it is the  interpretation  of the Bible which is wrong.   This seems like a new hope for Christianity for people like for myself.  Why couldn't have God created the world with the Big Bang theory (as my dad believes) and why couldn't have God created the world's inhabitants through evolution?    YOU  say that these theories go against the bible, but maybe  YOUR  interpretation is wrong.  Later on, in 1992, the Pope (one of the few Christian leaders whom I hold with VERY high regard) basically repeated what Galileo said.  He said something along the lines that there has been a "mutual misunderstanding" between both science and religion.  He said that when science is at odds with religion, then perhaps the actual correct interpretation of the bible is different than the previous erroneous interpretations.  Interesting revelations.

      This was a Republican at the  urlLink John Kerry forums  claiming that Bush wasn't a Republican.  Strange, but a very interesting read:   I come from a strong, conservative, Christian, military Republican family background,... so I know how they think.  If you ask me what my values are, I would say I'm a Conservative. I don't see this as a bad thing... just misunderstood in the current political context. Bush & Co are not truly conservative. I like the "neo-con" term that's been used a lot lately, but I have a better one: "radical elitist."  Why my conservative values make me a Democrat:  1. I believe in balanced budgets, and fiscal responsibility. Let's see, what was that deficit number again? But Clinton and Erskine Bowles managed to get balanced budgets, and not only eliminate the deficit but get us a surplus!  2. Tax cuts can be good,... but only if you follow rule #1. Tax cuts are even more beneficial to the economy when the people who get them spend the money. Let's see, this single mother of three (all legitimately born into a traditional marriage), didn't get ANY tax cuts. In fact, I saw my rent go up (property tax), basic needs prices go up (sales tax increase), and not only didn't qualify for the per child tax credit and refunds, but couldn't even discount my childcare costs! Ah, how many times have my Dad's delusions been dashed when he called me about the good news his President was saving me money, just to be told it wasn't true.  3. Don't make radical changes in existing programs, and make sure that any changes being made have research to back it up.  4. Unfunded state mandates are BAD. Let's see, we pass an act called Leave No Child Behind, then force states to pay to meet these new standards, but not provide money for it. We demand changes in their welfare programs, set up Medicaid requirements, add more paperwork to the free & reduced lunch program, require significant improvements in homeland security... and cut the funding for all of it. More demands on states with less money? Gee, no wonder all the states are in debt!  5. Support the military,... then never use them. Wasn't Clinton criticised for overextending our troops? This new unilateral doctrine violates everything I was ever taught. The soldiers and veterans who are willing to put their lives on the line deserve top treatment and pay. This admin slashes those benefits, and fights wars of choice - while ignoring the real threat.  6. Protection begins at home. The expected "conservative" response to being attacked is to become isolationist and protect our borders first. Once that's done, THEN you go after the people responsible and take them out in a surgical strike. Instead, Bush & Co have CUT funding for our first responders, moved funding and personnel off the AlQaeda trail, and played right into Osamas PR spin.  7. Can you explain to me how vouchers became a "conservative issue"? Vouchers already exist - they're called scholarships, preferably from a non-profit. Instead of a new forced tax (BAD), we get a voluntary tax deduction (GOOD). Non-profits can use volunteers and donations to reduce costs (GOOD)- the government requires paid staff and multiple layers of wasteful paperwork (BAD). Do we really need another layer of government bureaucracy. Plus, the government is more likely to be subject to frivolous lawsuits. If a government agency decides it doesn't want to fund a private school because, for example, it's nothing but Al Queda-like training or part of a cult-movement, well, it will be sued - and the tax payers have to cover it. A non-profit can be more diligent about what sort of private schools meet it's definitions according to what donors have indicated they are interested in. Donors have more control over where the final money goes to then the taxpayers do. Plus there's always simple Economics 101: Supply and demand. If you supply a set amount of money for students to go to private schools, private schools can raise their tuition by that amount.  8. Hard work should be rewarded. Any person who follows the rules and is willing to work 40-hours per week should be able to make basic needs - minimum. This was true in the 60's, but no longer is (which I've learned the hard way). People should get more tax incentives and benefits for actually working then from inheritance or laying around the pool watching their stock investments jump. Tax breaks for doctors, lawyers, professors, are fine. Tax incentives for Paris Hilton - NOT! Just make sure any American willing to put in the time and energy get some reward for their hard work.  9. Children need their parents! This means making sure one parent working 40-hours per week can support their families basic needs. This allows married couples to decide if one of them is able to take on the stress and joys of staying home with their child(ren) - or even if they want to split the load for 2-part-time. Note: This is an issue of CHOICE, based on ability and aptitude - not gender. I hate the term "working mother" - all mothers are working mothers; let's use the term "employed parent." For single parents, children need a secure quality affordable child care program - and should not be forced to spend more than 50 hours a week away from them to put a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs (that's a lunch hour and 30-min commute).  10. Sanctity of marriage means not paying poor mothers to get married. If you need a bribe to marry someone, that's not a sacrament - it's prostitution. I'm pro-marriage, but my religious faith makes re-marriage a much less viable option. Forget about banning gay marriages - let's ban celebrity marriages. Can anyone say J Lo, Britney, and our favorite 3-time divorcee Rush? Reducing the financial stresses of couples balancing 3-4 jobs in the marriage to make ends meet could definately help keep families intact.  11. The value of "Privacy and small government" v the Patriot Act. Need I say more?  George Bush has proposed radical, drastic and dangerous changes to the way we do business. He has also devalued work (only income from work would be taxed in his ideal state) and made it next to impossible for those who have not already achieved the American Dream to ever get there. "Those who are saved act like the saved, and those who are damned act like the damned." Gee, didn't this guy ever read the Book of Job? (Probably got scared away by the word that looked like "job")  This is what makes him a "Radical Elitist". Using "conservative" as an insult or definition of these new Republicans just makes true conservatives (like me) feel attacked. Once we can redefine the terminology, those swing voters will be more likely to listen to our message.

      Well guys, I had a debate with someone John Wang introduced me to.  John Wang said he met the person on Counter Strike.  The guy was a staunch Republican, but since John Wang doesn't really keep up with presidential policies, he couldn't argue with the guy (or girl).  At first I just asked questions like where in Asia are they originally from? I got no response...so I just left and said, "Kerry 2004!"  A few minutes later, here's what unfolded:  I LiKe HoT AzNz: ahem I LiKe HoT AzNz: I hate john fucking kerry johnnydr87: why is that/ I LiKe HoT AzNz: and that's what the F in his name stands for I LiKe HoT AzNz: because he's an asshole I LiKe HoT AzNz: and if he wins johnnydr87: please use some support for your argument I LiKe HoT AzNz: I'm moving to japan I LiKe HoT AzNz: literally johnnydr87: not some bullshit I LiKe HoT AzNz: fine, how about, you don't change presidents in the middle of a war, to an appeaser? I LiKe HoT AzNz: I don't want to appease the enemy, I want to go out there and kill them johnnydr87: you're talking about the 2004 elections? I LiKe HoT AzNz: yes I LiKe HoT AzNz: john kerry is an appeaser johnnydr87: that's ridiculous johnnydr87: that's the republican argument I LiKe HoT AzNz: no it's not I LiKe HoT AzNz: it's the libertarian argument johnnydr87: unpatriotic for having different views I LiKe HoT AzNz: I am not a republican, I have never supported a republican before bush johnnydr87: haahaha I LiKe HoT AzNz: bush has been a great president, although I disagree with him on almost everything, I disagree with kerry more johnnydr87: such as? I LiKe HoT AzNz: no child left behind, what bullshit I LiKe HoT AzNz: all that money just got thrown out the window I LiKe HoT AzNz: it's like you just took a bag of money I LiKe HoT AzNz: and opened it up I LiKe HoT AzNz: and held it out the window johnnydr87: got it. I LiKe HoT AzNz: and watched the dollar bills fly down the street johnnydr87: point taken. johnnydr87: that was bush I LiKe HoT AzNz: yes johnnydr87: now what about kerry I LiKe HoT AzNz: well, john kerry is even worse I LiKe HoT AzNz: he's made all these promises I LiKe HoT AzNz: he promises to double social security? I LiKe HoT AzNz: it's going to go bankrupt in 40 years, now it'll be 20 kthx johnnydr87: brb...keep typing johnnydr87: the budget was in surplus pre-Bush johnnydr87: then it went to a multbillion dollar deficit johnnydr87: with his tax cuts for the super rich johnnydr87: and poor economic policy johnnydr87: how can you say a democrat could be worse than this guy? johnnydr87: in his first 2 years 2.5 million jobs were lost johnnydr87: 25 million were created with clinton johnnydr87: and you know what, clinton was in the same situation with bush senior as kerry will be with bush junior johnnydr87: deficits. I LiKe HoT AzNz: wait wait johnnydr87: i am still totally confused how you could say bush is better than kerry I LiKe HoT AzNz: do you know how much money this "surplus" was? johnnydr87: yeah I LiKe HoT AzNz: not a whole lot johnnydr87: 4.6 tril I LiKe HoT AzNz: didn't even pay for 9/11 johnnydr87: didn't pay for 9/11 johnnydr87: what are you talking about I LiKe HoT AzNz: to clean up ground zero I LiKe HoT AzNz: do you think we would just let the big pile of rubble stay there? I LiKe HoT AzNz: how about the war, there are lots of reason for a deficite I LiKe HoT AzNz: but we are paying it off btw johnnydr87: wtf johnnydr87: lol I LiKe HoT AzNz: and it's going quicker then most people have thought johnnydr87: thats a dumb argument I LiKe HoT AzNz: half of it will be paid off in december of this year... johnnydr87: we couldnt pay 9/11 with the surplus? johnnydr87: hello? do you know how much a trillion is? I LiKe HoT AzNz: if we go at this pace, which we probably won't I LiKe HoT AzNz: yeah, trillion, that'll get you nowhere johnnydr87: besides, bush fucked up the surplus and made it a deficit pretty early johnnydr87: are you kidding me? I LiKe HoT AzNz: not for the government anyways johnnydr87: yeah it will I LiKe HoT AzNz: yeah, look, bush can't control the economy I LiKe HoT AzNz: in order to keep the government running, it does need money johnnydr87: his policies can I LiKe HoT AzNz: yeah, and he has placed wonderful policies johnnydr87: no argument there, now what's your point  johnnydr87: not the policies part I LiKe HoT AzNz: I just love these tax cuts, which btw are not for only the rich johnnydr87: i know they're not johnnydr87: but they have an unfair ratio for the rich I LiKe HoT AzNz: good, because I've never been hired before by a poor person I LiKe HoT AzNz: for some odd reason, I get hired by rich people to do work johnnydr87: Ugh. trickle down economics I LiKe HoT AzNz: and money trickles down johnnydr87: stop.  johnnydr87: it's been proven time and time again that trickle down economics doesn't work.....CEOs can invest the money overseas johnnydr87: like they did the past 4 year I LiKe HoT AzNz: no, you're wrong johnnydr87: how? johnnydr87: you're telling me they didn't invest overseas I LiKe HoT AzNz: it's not like that, it's greed I LiKe HoT AzNz: and greed is good I LiKe HoT AzNz: a system driven by greed is better johnnydr87: no it's not I LiKe HoT AzNz: than a system driven by peace I LiKe HoT AzNz: sure it is I LiKe HoT AzNz: because everyone has greed I LiKe HoT AzNz: peace is only for some johnnydr87: then basic rights are subsidized I LiKe HoT AzNz: and equality johnnydr87: for example I LiKe HoT AzNz: give me a break, a system driven on equality would die down johnnydr87: american workers have to compete against workers in india I LiKe HoT AzNz: yeah? johnnydr87: and thus either they lose their jobs to indian (cheaper pay) johnnydr87: or, they get lower wages I LiKe HoT AzNz: oh I see, hey tell me this I LiKe HoT AzNz: china is a big place where we're exporting jobs right I LiKe HoT AzNz: it costs more to live in hong kong then it does in new york I LiKe HoT AzNz: and the businesses are realizing this, they're moving jobs to canada I LiKe HoT AzNz: because of the tax system loopholes johnnydr87: right, they're not building factories in hong kong, they're building factories in parts of china where it's cheaper and poorer so they don't have to pay wages as high.  johnnydr87: your last statement, moving to canada because of taxholes....that's understandable johnnydr87: how does that help your argument, are you arguing for me? johnnydr87: americans are losing their jobs to other countries because there is no deterrant to do otherwise johnnydr87: (for ceos) johnnydr87: (for ceos to move the jobs elsewhere) I LiKe HoT AzNz: they'e been exporting jobs for the past years I LiKe HoT AzNz: not just 4 I LiKe HoT AzNz: like 10 johnnydr87: right, but why did so many more outsource these 4 years than the previous years? johnnydr87: because bush's economic policies  johnnydr87: make it easier to do so johnnydr87: besides other state taxes, gasoline, etc. prices have risen since the "tax cut" johnnydr87: how much of your tax cut did you have to give back johnnydr87: ($600 in my family's case) johnnydr87: interesting link: http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/03/04/23_resume.html johnnydr87: you know who's going to pay back the deficit I LiKe HoT AzNz: alt f4 I LiKe HoT AzNz: leave me alone johnnydr87: thenext generations I LiKe HoT AzNz: nothing personal I LiKe HoT AzNz: just trying to talk to someone much more imortant johnnydr87: it's ok, when you don't have an argument it get's hard to sound intelligent (you) I LiKe HoT AzNz: you too Auto response from johnnydr87: I am away from my computer right now. johnnydr87: how so I LiKe HoT AzNz: leave me alone johnnydr87: exactly   A few minutes later, I added this.   johnnydr87: Learn to think for yourself, and not follow your friends and Fox News like lemmings.  You have your own brain.    Damn, I forgot to ask the guy what he had against Kerry.  He dodged my question without me noticing.

[FBI, Uniform Crime Report, 1992 and 1997] 1,189 More Police: The President's 1994 Crime Bill has funded 1,189 new police officers to date in communities across Arkansas. [through 1/00] Reducing Crime with Drug Courts: Working to reduce drug-related crime in Arkansas, the Clinton Administration has awarded a Drug Court grant to the community of Little Rock. Drug courts use the coercive power of the criminal justice system to combine drug testing, sanctions, supervision and treatment to push nonviolent, drug-abusing offenders to stop using drugs and committing crimes. Over $8 Million to Combat Domestic Violence: Through the Violence Against Women Act, Arkansas has received over $8 million in federal funds since FY95 to establish more women's shelters and bolster law enforcement, prosecution and victims' services. [through FY99] Nearly $549,000 in Grants for Battered Women and Children: In FY99, Arkansas received $549,000 in HHS's Family Violence Prevention Program grants to assist women and children fleeing domestic abuse. $4.1 Million to Keep Drugs & Violence Out of Arkansas' Schools: Arkansas receives $4.1 million in FY00 for the Safe & Drug Free Schools Program, which invests in school security and drug prevention programs. MOVING ARKANSANS FROM WELFARE TO WORK 44,632 Fewer People on Welfare: There are 44,632 fewer people on welfare in Arkansas now than there were at the beginning of 1993 -- a 60% decrease. [through 6/99] Encouraging Responsible Choices—Preventing Teen Pregnancy in Arkansas: Since 1993, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have supported innovative and promising teen pregnancy prevention strategies, with significant components of the strategy becoming law in the 1996 Personal Responsibility Act. The law requires unmarried minor parents to stay in school and live at home or in a supervised setting; encourages “second chance homes” to provide teen parents with the skills and support they need; and provides $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education activities. Efforts are making a difference, adolescent pregnancy rates and teen abortion rates are declining. And between 1991 and 1997, teen pregnancy rates declined 8.6% in Arkansas. Child Support Collections Up 139%: Child support collections have increased by $59 million—or 139% -- in Arkansas since FY92. [through FY98] $20.1 Million for Arkansas Welfare-to-Work: In 1998, Arkansas received $8.5 million in Federal welfare-to-work state formula grants (the state matched $4.2 million in funding), helping Arkansas welfare recipients get and keep jobs. In addition, in 1999 and 1998 a total of $7.4 million in competitive grants were awarded to Arkansas localities to support innovative welfare-to-work strategies. Part of the President's comprehensive efforts to move recipients from welfare to work, this funding was included in the $3 billion welfare to work fund in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. Helping People Get to Work: Through the Access to Jobs initiative, the Clinton-Gore Administration is working with communities across the country to design transportation solutions to help welfare recipients and other low-income workers get to and from work. Little Rock and Pine Bluff have received a total of $508,500 this year to fund innovative transit projects. INVESTING IN ARKANSAS' HEALTH Health Care for Nearly One Thousand Uninsured Children in Arkansas: In 1997, President Clinton passed the largest single investment in health care for children since 1965 -- an unprecedented $24 billion over five years to cover as many as five million children throughout the nation. This investment guarantees the full range of benefits that children need to grow up strong and healthy. Two million children nationwide have health care coverage thanks to the President's plan, including 913 in Arkansas. [HHS, Health Care Financing Administration, FY99 SCHIP enrollment data] Helping Over 82,000 Arkansas Women and Children with WIC: The Clinton Administration is committed to full funding in the Special Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). In FY99, Arkansas received $46.2 million in total WIC grant funding, helping 82,825 women, infants and children in need receive health and food assistance. [through 8/99] More Toddlers Are Being Immunized: As a result of the President's 1993 Childhood Immunization Initiative, childhood immunization rates have reached an historic high. According to the CDC, 90% or more of America's toddlers received the most critical doses of each of the routinely recommended vaccines in 1996, 1997, and again in 1998 —surpassing the President's 1993 goal. In Arkansas in 1998, 89% of two-year olds received the vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis; 90% received the vaccine for polio; 88% received the vaccine for measles, and 89% received the vaccine for Haemophilus influenzae B, the bacteria causing a form of meningitis. Funding for HIV/AIDS Assistance Programs: In FY 2000, Arkansas will receive $1.6 million in Ryan White Title II formula grants. This funding provides people living with HIV and AIDS medical and support services. Also through the Ryan White Act, Arkansas will receive $2.1 million for state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs), which help those without insurance obtain much needed prescription drugs. There has been a tenfold increase in ADAP funding in the last four years, up from $52 million in 1996 to $528 million in 2000. [HHS, Health Resources and Services Administration, 4/7/00] Tobacco Plan Will Cut Smoking and Premature Deaths by 42% in Arkansas: The Clinton Administration's tobacco proposal, combined with the recently enacted state tobacco settlements, will cut youth smoking and resulting premature deaths 42% in Arkansas by 2004. Between 2000 and 2004, 14,800 of Arkansas's youth will be kept from smoking and 9,700 will be spared a premature tobacco-related death. [Treasury Dept., 2/99] 1,000,000 Americans in Arkansas Cannot Be Assured They Have Patient Protections: Even if Arkansas enacted all the protections in the Patients' Bill of Rights, 1,000,000 people in Arkansas cannot be assured they have the comprehensive patient protections recommended by the President's Advisory Commission. This is because the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) may preempt state-enacted protections. That is why the President has called on Congress to pass a federally enforceable patients' bill of rights so that everyone enrolled in managed care may have a basic set of protections. Notably, 500,000 Arkansas women are in ERISA health plans and are therefore not necessarily protected. Women are particularly vulnerable without these protections because they are greater users of health care services, they make three-quarters of the health care decisions for their families, and they have specific health care needs addressed by a patients' bill of rights. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT 6 Toxic Waste Sites Cleaned Up: Since 1993, the EPA has completed 6 Superfund toxic waste cleanups in Arkansas -- in Omaha, Edmondson, Ola, and three in Jacksonville. This is double the number of sites cleaned up in Arkansas during the previous two administrations. [through 3/1/00] $11 Million in Safe Drinking Water Funding: This year [FY00], thanks to President Clinton, Arkansas will receive $11 million for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to provide low-interest loans to municipalities to build, improve, and prevent pollution of drinking water systems. SPEARHEADING URBAN AND RURAL RENEWAL EFFORTS Revitalizing Arkansas' Communities: Little Rock/ Pulaski County, East Central, and Mississippi County were all designated Enterprise Communities in December, 1994 and were awarded $3 million each to create more jobs, housing, and economic opportunity for area residents. In 1999, Little Rock/North Little Rock was named a Strategic Planning Community. Expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Will Help Develop 1,900 To 2,300 New Affordable Housing Units in Arkansas Over the Next 5 years: Last year, the President and Vice President pushed for a 40-percent expansion in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. This year, the President and Vice President will try again to enact tax incentives to develop affordable housing. In Arkansas alone, this proposal would mean an additional 1,900 - 2,300 quality rental housing units for low-income American families during the next five years. PROVIDING DISASTER RELIEF $71.5 Million in Federal Emergency Assistance: Since 1993, Arkansas has received $71.5 million in disaster relief. This includes $107.2 million in assistance to recover from Hurricane Opal, which occurred in October of 1995. [FEMA, 2/29/00] EXPANDING FUNDS FOR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT Over $1.3 Billion in Federal Highway Aid: Since 1993, Arkansas has received over $1.3 billion in federal highway aid, including $2.1 million for emergency relief in response to natural disasters. These funds have helped generate 59,442 jobs. [through FY99] Over $68.7 Million in Transit Funding: Since 1993, Arkansas has received over $68.7 million in Federal Transit Funding. Over $136 Million in Airport Improvement Program Funds: From FY93-FY99 Arkansas received over $136 million in Airport Improvement Program funds to help build and renovate airports, and, when necessary, to provide funds for noise abatement to improve the quality of life for residents who live near airports. Saving Lives and Property: In 1997, the United States Coast Guard saved 5 lives in Arkansas.

      It's amazing that I've already been called names for this newest article by the same  "Christians" (Eric Couch using the name KCC7324...so I wonder if it was actually Kevin, probably not).  They go to church twice on Sunday and at least once on Wednesday.  I go to church every other Sunday and I'm not nearly as hostile as them.  It makes you wonder what they're really taught if they hate irrationally.   It also makes you wonder what they think when they read this.  Do they say to themselves, "he has a point. Christianity is about love. We better watch ourselves."  Or do they continue being outright vulgar and continue even though they KNOW it's wrong and they KNOW God wouldn't approve of it.  Based on this, I could easily argue that Christianity's values are more important to me than them, and that they use Christianity as a cover for them to hate.  I wonder if they are a reflection of their pastor, or if their pastor wouldn'y approve of how they act.  Oh, and by "they", I mean people who insult irrationally, not good Christians in there church.

       (Note: This will be a multiple part series)   Well, I guess I should tackle what I've been thinking about for months.  What type of person am I regarding my outlook on life?  Also, what type of person is whom I would refer to as a redneck (derogatively)?  I would have analyzed this privately to myself had I not created a blog and  urlLink had I not argued with Jeremy .      Me  The thing which has changed over the years with me is the way I view the world.  I used to view the world solely from a Christian perspective; it was right or wrong depending on if it was in the bible or not.  As I grew older, I started pondering and asking myself several question which gradually eroded my Christian bias.  It started in confirmation class, and for those of you who don't know, it's a class you have to take where you study the philosophy of the bible in order to be allowed to take communion (I'm Lutheran).  I asked the pastor simple questions, such as: "did generations of civilizations who had never heard about Christianity die and go to hell?", "if all humans were wiped out during the flood, then wouldn't that mean we descended from Noah (more recently) instead of Adam and Eve?", or "christianity was basically a new religion being preached...so if some guy starts preaching a new religion today, what makes it less credible than Christianity in it's early days?"    It's not hard to spot inconsistencies in the bible.  For example, incest is condemned, but Adam and Eve's children had to have had sex if they wanted to populate the world.  Another example: how did all these races come about after the whole world was flooded?  The same answer I got from the pastor was, "That's for God to know, and not for you to worry about." That's an easy way to get out of the question.  Christianity is relative.  If you're born in the middle east you're going to be a Muslim, if you're born in the west, most likely a Christian.  To sentence someone to the fiery pits of hell because they were born in the wrong family is pretty brutal.  Anyways, I'm digressing.  Back on topic: this questioning spirit is how I came to be (what I consider) unobjective when looking at situations.  I have severed Christianity's grasp over me.  I'm still debating the truths and falsities of Christianity, and honestly, I'm having a hard time believing it.  The fact that it's so easy to point out inconsistencies is what hurts it.  I definitely believe in a God of some sort though.....   I'm going to end it here for tonight because I'm tired.  I will make this a multiple part series.  Do not make judgements on me until you have read everything I will cover: Lakeside, ASMSA, things which shaped me, church, and the uninformed (err...rednecks)

      I've always know that more intelligent and more open minded people support Democrats.  Case in point: the nobel prize winners support John Kerry.  Here's the article:  " 	 An Open Letter to the American People by 48 Nobel Prize Winning Scientists  June 21, 2004  Presidential elections present us with choices about our nation's future. We support John Kerry for President and urge you to join us.  The prosperity, health, environment, and security of Americans depend on Presidential leadership to sustain our vibrant science and technology; to encourage education at home and attract talented scientists and engineers from abroad; and to nurture a business environment that transforms new knowledge into new opportunities for creating quality jobs and reaching shared goals.  President Bush and his administration are compromising our future on each of these counts. By reducing funding for scientific research, they are undermining the foundation of America's future. By setting unwarranted restrictions on stem cell research, they are impeding medical advances. By employing inappropriate immigration practices, they are turning critical scientific talent away from our shores. And by ignoring scientific consensus on critical issues such as global warming, they are threatening the earth's future. Unlike previous administrations, Republican and Democratic alike, the Bush administration has ignored unbiased scientific advice in the policy-making that is so important to our collective welfare.  John Kerry will change all this. He will support strong investments in science and technology as he restores fiscal responsibility. He will stimulate the development and deployment of technologies to meet our economic, energy, environmental, health, and security needs. He will recreate an America that provides opportunity to all at home or abroad who can help us make progress together.  John Kerry will restore science to its appropriate place in government and bring it back into the White House. He is the clear choice for America's next President.  Signed,  List of names edited out (too long, too much space).  Check out Johnkerry.com if you want the list of names, the year they were awarded the nobel prize, and what the won it for.

      Kerry's speech was the speech of the century.  It was absolutely fucking amazing.  And pundits agree.  The only people who would vote Bush now are those that are already die hard republicans or those that did not listen to it.  I was listening to glowing reviews of it all over the place, including some Republicans on PBS.  Whenever I listen to a speech, I sometimes imagine myself as the speech giver and try to think of how it was formulated to help further my abilities.  This speech was THE BEST speech I have heard in my life.  It wasn't JUST the speech though...it was the buildup TOWARDS the speech with the help pf his daughters and fellow Vietnam soldiers.  How he engineered this I don't think I will understand without a few more years of school...and I consider myself highly adept when it comes to these sorts of things.  Listening to it over again on C-Span I'm still as spellbounded as I was before.  I have a habit of comparing myself with people and speeches I hear.  I often like to speculate to whether I can reach a person's talent by the time I get to be their age.  Normally I say I probably could with more schooling...but this was absolutely amazing.  I seriously doubt I will ever hear a speech like that again for a LONG time.

      Watching the DNC tonight was really touching.  Especially John Edwards speech. If you didn't see it, I recommend you do.  I love the Democratic party.  It's so diverse.  There were straights, gays, African-Americans, Native Americans, asians, caucasians, muslims, jews, rappers, country artists, singers, other musicians, christians, athiest, agnostic,etc.  Oh and nobel laureates.  It seems these incredibly smart people don't support the president.   No surprise there.    Why so many different people of different races, creeds, and colors?  Because that's how the Democratic party is.  We accept different opinions and don't censor them.  It wouldn't be our philosophy.  Why else would there be 10 democrats that ran for the democratic primary, all with different backgrounds and different shades of skin.    Don't get confused, LIBERALS are what founded this country.  They left the conservative ways of class warfare and where you were either born into a higher class family or a lower class family.  They wanted equality for all: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  They believed people are entitled to have their own opinions.  Those were VERY liberal views in a very conservative time period.    Don't get if confused, Jesus was a liberal (in most regards).  Equal quality for women?  Yes, this is what Jesus often talked about.  It also happens to be a liberal view, after all, Democrats were the ones who brought about the Civil Rights Act and the right for women and colored people to vote.     Jesus  also cared about the poor.  Do you think Jesus would approve of a tax cut which explicitly rewards rich people (because you know, they need the money!) and explicitly neglects middle class and poor people? My family got our $600 tax cut (nope, we aren't in the top 1 %, too bad), only to be bogged down with more taxes in certain areas and for gas prices to rise.  Lets not forgot the 1 million people who have lost jobs since Bush became President.   Since when does harming the world, environment, other peoples, and even the less fortunate of our peoples become a Christian value?   Please, the religious right is a group of incompetent lemmings.  As Al Sharpton once said,  "There's a difference between the 'Christian Right' and the right Christians."     Now let's take a different perspective.  Let's preview at the Republican National Convention.   Well, first let's list the races will see.  Caucasian and 2 or 3 hired black guys.  Now, lets list the religions: ignorant Christians and business (yes, business and making money is a religion for a LOT of republicans---i.e. they worship money).  The musicians will be....country singers, Jessica Simpson, and Britney Spears.  Because they love to say you are unpatriotic if you disagree with the president.   There's a difference between being patriotic to American ideals and being blind, patriotic sheep to corrupt policies.   As Ron Reagan, son of the Republican Ronald Reagan said about the present day Republican party:     "The Bush people have no right to speak for my father, particularly because of the position he's in now," he said during a recent interview with Salon. "Yes, some of the current policies are an extension of the '80s. But the overall thrust of this administration is not my father's -- these people are overly reaching, overly aggressive, overly secretive, and just plain corrupt. I don't trust these people."    I imagine we'll see a sea of cowboy hats at the RNC.      Long live diversity, equality, freedom, and especially liberals (there seems to be bad connotation that Republicans have made with that name, so get it out of your head), who will always stand for the rights of the common citizen, not just those who have the most money to donate.

      "If you are Al-Qaeda, we will destroy you." -John Edwards  That sentence was so Bush like.  It was a hillbilly cowboy type sentence.

      Ugh, he's so incompetent.  Ok, that wasn't the actual article's title, but here it is, by the Washington Post:   Bush's bloopers disappearing from transcripts White House record excises mistakes, hecklers, false starts   Dana Milbank, Washington Post 		Wednesday, April 17, 2002 San Francisco Chronicle Chronicle Sections  Washington -- April 9 was one for the presidential blooper reel.  At a speech in Bridgeport, Conn., President Bush declared that he wanted each American to volunteer for "4,000 years," a variation of his usual call for "4,000 hours," which produced guffaws in the audience. Later, at a fund- raiser, Bush bestowed a new name on Connecticut's lieutenant governor, Jodi Rell. "I appreciate Lieutenant Governor Judi Kell for being here," he said. "Great to see you again, Judi."  Whatever, says Cathleen Hinsch, a spokeswoman for Rell. "You don't correct the president."  But the White House does. Both goofs, and accompanying laughter, were stricken from the record in the official White House transcripts.  A similar sanitizing occurred the day before, in Knoxville, Tenn., when Bush was interrupted by hecklers shouting about Enron and the counterterrorism campaign -- an unusual occurrence noted in news accounts of the speech. Federal News Service, a private organization, transcribed the boos, shouts and cheers, along with the president's struggle to deliver his lines.  The official White House transcript made no mention of the hecklers or Bush's false starts.  The opposition sees a Soviet-style move to airbrush infelicitous phrases. "These transcripts are done for near-term history as well as long-term history,  and it's a real problem if they start rewriting them," said Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary for President Bill Clinton. "The White House is rewriting history."  Lockhart said the Clinton administration had never cleaned up transcripts except to correct spelling, but veteran correspondents recall the practice occurring in both Democratic and GOP administrations. Lockhart's predecessor, Mike McCurry, said he had given White House stenographers "some leeway" to repair verbal abuses, including the task of "restoring 'g' to the English language" when Clinton's accent deleted the sound.  White House stenographers are respected professionals employed by a private contractor. Marshall Jorpeland of the National Court Reporters Association said the stenographers would not independently veer from verbatim. "When people hire us, they expect a word-for-word account," he said. "In terms of cleaning it up on their own, I don't think they'd do that without that being the guidance."  So are Bush aides providing "guidance"?  White House spokeswoman Anne Womack noted that the transcripts had at times included hecklers and Bush-coined words such as "misunderestimated."  "We view the transcripts as a historical record of the presidency," she said. "We expect accuracy and commend the stenographers for their excellent work."  Cleaning quotes can be hazardous. Recently, a White House transcript had Bush talking about stock options that "earn the money," when in fact he had correctly used the Wall Street jargon "in the money." The confusion prompted an incorrect news report that Bush was shifting policy. FOOTNOTING AND DELETING  WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS  Some examples of the footnoting of transcripts to clarify what the president meant:  -- Death and taxes: In Missouri last month, Bush expressed his desire for "making the death tax permanent." The White House transcript placed an asterisk next to the blooper and a footnote saying "should read 'death tax repeal.' "  -- Mangled in Japan: In February, Bush baffled some listeners when he said he had spoken with the Japanese prime minister about "the devaluation issue" and told Japan's parliament the United States and Japan had been allies "for a century and a half." Asterisks in the official transcript indicated Bush meant to say "deflation" and "half a century."  -- Threat unveiled: The most public allegation of transcript sanitizing was last September, when White House press secretary Ari Fleischer warned that Americans "need to watch what they say." The phrase did not at first appear in the White House transcript.

      Here's a recap:  -Press didn't ask hard questions to Bush administration, mostly because they're afraid of losing their jobs.  Example:  NBC news (as well as MSNBC and CNBC) is owned by General Electric which has several million dollar in contracts in Iraq.  I've already told you about CNN and AOL Time Warner.  -When people watch Fahreinheit 9/11 for the first time, they are surprised.  "I didn't know that black voters were shut down in the Congress when they brought up the illegally disenfranchised voters." etc. etc.  -Dale Earhardt was on Fox News and they were talking and they asked him what he did over  the weekend.  He said he took his crew to watch Fahreinheit 9/11.  Michael Moore said he just about fell out of his seat when he heard this.  Dale even recommended the movie to people! As do i!    -Talks about a soldier who said that they booed at him when he was at the academy awards for making statements about the Iraqi war.  The soldier said he was very angry at him.  The soldier then said that he was sorry he booed, because after fighting there, he has realized it was true that they are there under false pretenses.  -54% of the country now doesn't support the war.  Talked about how the American people are smart, and if they're given the correct information, they'll realize what the war is really about.  (Note: if you don't understand how Iraq was not connected to terrorism or Al-Qaeda, then you're an idiot and I don't feel like getting carpal tunnel sydrome explaining)  -Talked about Republicans who have been sending them letters. He said there are a LOT of good Republicans.  They are for womens rights, they are against assault weapons, they're not racist etc.  The only area where they differ from Dems is they don't want money taken from them.  Well, Mike says we need to show them what the Republicans have taken from them, causing a multi billion dollar deficit from the 4 trillion dollar surplus we were in.  -We need to go after people who are not just "likely voters" (referring to polls which only go after likely voters).  The people who are voting are the people getting abused by the Bush administration.  The poor, the lower class.  -Greens are united with Democrats and a few Republicans to get Bush out of White House  -Ralph Nader:  The republicans love him.  Nader gathered 50,000 signatures, enough to put him on the ballot in Michigan.  43,000 of those were Republican asshole fuckers.  FUCK YOU REPUBLICANS.  Mike says he, and several others, tried to convince Ralph not to run....and that Ralph is one of the great americans.  He is dissappointed that he can't see the common thread against bush.  -Democrats have become more vibrant from 2000 (In My Opinion, because of all the SHIT we have had to put up in the past 4 year).  Made several jokes.....can't type fast..... must keep up  -12% of 18-25s are voting for Nader.  He said the spoke with honesty why they were: "Because there's no bullshit," is what they said.  Telling democrats not to be afraid.  Not to be the "hamburger" version of hte Republican party.  Don't say, "We'll give health care to almost everyone."  Make real promises. Don't be afraid.  -The only reason we should go to war is if it is an absolute LAST resort.  I missed the rest of what he said  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fahreinheit 9/11 will make you angry at the Bush administration.  All the events DID happen, and in some cases were ONLY investigated by foreign news services like BBC because the news services here are the corporation's bitches.  Watch it and open your Republican biased, ignorant minds (just kidding---in most cases, that is).

      Got this email a few days ago from Brandon about an earlier post I made:   But what is the theory behind the Big Bang Theory. The extent of my knowledge is that there was an explosion and the universe was born. But that's the kid's version. What was it from? Why did it happen? What caused it? Just a fellow inquisitor...   I stayed away from this one for a while because it's a multifaceted question.  First off, let me say that my knowledge of the Big Bang Theory is fairly limited.  I only understand the basic underlying principles.  For the average person, that's all you NEED to know.  To understand the whole theory, you have to learn whole new scientific concepts, otherwise the theory makes no sense at all.  Anyways, here are the basics behind the theory for the average joe: 1) In the beginning of time, there was a humongous explosion beyond comprehension in which particles of the Universe were dispersed at a tremendous speed.  2)  In this explosion, the laws of physicss AS WE KNOW THEM collapsed.  3)  Secular (non-religious) AND Christian scientists both endorse this theory, because science has proven this theory true.  The way it was proven true was complex, and there is no "laymen" way to describe it without losing crucial information.  I believe though, by measuring some sort of part from the electromagnetic spectrum, they   were able to trace it back to the beginnings of time.  For you religious zealots, this is just a fact you'll have to accept: you, and most people (like myself, right now) will NEVER fully understand the process because the people who have discovered these theories are HIGHLY intelligent and HIGHLY decorated with scientific backgrounds(sp?).    Just because you can't understand it (which includes evolution) doesn't mean that it didn't happen.  It seems that certain church denominations are more accepting of science then others.  I won't name names.  The thing you're going to do right after reading this is wonder, "What was there before the Big Bang?"  That's where God and "intelligent design" comes in.  Christian scientists believe that this is how God created the universe.  I will give you a more in-depth description of the Big Bang when I ask my dad, who is, as many of you know, an astronomer.  He, by the way, is part of a Christian Science club called, "Reasons to believe" (which uses science to prove intelligent design).

      {Note: I'm still pissed off at Republicans, lots of vulgarity in the ensuing session.)  Watched the DNC today.  Man, Clinton is so eloquent and such a great speech giver.  Not the same as that regurgitated BS you get from Bush and Company.  Clinton was clearly a better President than Bush, and if you can't see that you're either:  A) A religious zealot Republican (who, although against abortion, is FOR the death penalty, FOR ignoring the poor, FOR harming the environment---issues which SHOULD affect Christians).  B) A rich asshole  C) A complete dumbass

       [Note: I will be cursing through this whole section;  I haven't been this mad in a while].    I saw this article, and it pissed me off right away:   urlLink CNN/Aim Article .   Can you spot why? Read the article through first. If you can't, then congratulations, you've earned the "I'm a Fucking Retard and I Have Been Listening to Fox News for So Long That I Can't Tell the Difference Between Partisan News and REAL News" Award.     First, some History.     Everyone thinks CNN is biased to the left and counterbalances Fox News which is to the right. If you think this, good job dumbass! You've been slurping up that bullshit Mantra of Fox News very well!     CNN is owned by AOL Time Warner which had Colin Powell, the present Secretary of State of the USA (Republican, for you dumbasses), who was on the board of executives for it. Now, his son is on the same board instead of Colin Powell. Naturally, they have become more conservative because of this. They have hired a lot more conservative hosts like Paula Zhan and others (can't name them all off the top of my head).    I'm not going to even go into Fox News. They are undoubtedly biased and even the dumbest twit can point it out (It was started by some rich Republicans and Journalists).     The Breakdown:     Democrats Roll Out a GOP-Baiting Reagan  BOSTON (AP) - Never mind Reagan Democrats. Here's a Democratic Reagan, or at least a Reagan who sounds like one on TV. Ron Reagan, son of the late president, was accorded a plum speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday for reasons other than his expertise as a dog-show host on Animal Planet. "    Ok, now, why the fuck did they bother to mention an irrelavent fact to start out: "...for reasons other than his expertise as a dog-show host on Animal Planet." Um, ok. That's like me saying, " President Bush was elected for reasons other than the fact that he got arrested for driving drunk in Texas and Maine, although his Texas records have been mysteriously erased now. " That last half of my sentence was completely irrelavent and had nothing to do with the article. It's pretty clear that the writer from the get-go was trying to make it sound that Ron Reagan wasn't credible enough to comment on bigger topics. After all, he's a dog show host, right?   The prime - really only - reason is his name, the magic monicker of the Republican Party now pressed into the service of the other side. Nothing tickles partisans like seeing someone associated with the opposition make common cause with them.    Pressed into service? Ron Reagan AND Nancy Reagan (the wifte of Reagan) BOTH chose not to speak at the Republican Convention, you biased fucker. Why don't you fucking mention that?   In response to the second sentence: Nothing pisses me off like a report trying to act as if he's unbiased.   Republicans also plan an in-your-face guest at their convention, Georgia Sen. Zell Miller. The conservative Democrat insists he never strayed from his party, the party strayed from him.  ``Democrats like me have a courageous and honorable leader,'' he likes to say. ``It just so happens that he has a little R next to his name.'' That's R as in Republican George W. Bush.    That's a head-snapping switch from the 1992 Democratic convention, where Miller, as a keynote speaker, attacked the first President Bush and other R's with gusto. ``George Bush just doesn't get it,'' he charged. ``He doesn't see it, he doesn't feel it and he's done nothing about it."     It's ALWAYS, and I mean always, been obvious that Senator Miller was a Republican in disguise. Basically EVERYTHING he voted on he sided with Republicans. If I lived in the area of Georgia which he represented, I would vote for the Republican without thinking twice. If I Republican, I'll vote for a Republican....I don't want to vote for a Democrat and get a Republican. I really question whether this guy has any values, or if he's just in the biz for the money.    Let's not forget the many Bush Administration officials who left his administration because he's a complete asshole (the Homeland security guy, Richard Clarke-Counterterrorism guy, and a few others).    A liberal commentator on MSNBC as well as anchor of canine competitions on cable, Reagan once declared the freezer section of his grocery store more interesting than Republicans. He made the comment when the 1996 GOP national convention honored his dad. He didn't watch.    He once declared the freezer section of his grocery more interesting than Republicans?  Holy Jesus! Another irrelavent point which doesn't address what he talks about.  I listend to Ron's interview on NPR, and he had a lot more time to talk about his views on pretty much EVERYTHING.  He didn't watch?  Something must be wrong with him!  He has his own political views!  In the NPR interview, he clearly held his father in VERY HIGH esteem and NEVER talked about different political views he had with his father...  Here what Ron Reagan said (this is NOT the CNN article....that article was too biased to put something like this in)   "The Bush people have no right to speak for my father, particularly because of the position he's in now," he said during a recent interview with Salon. "Yes, some of the current policies are an extension of the '80s. But the overall thrust of this administration is not my father's -- these people are overly reaching, overly aggressive, overly secretive, and just plain corrupt. I don't trust these people."   For some odd reason, his mom didn't choose to attend the RNC either (as I previously mentioned).  Maybe because the Republican party has become corrupt, mean, among other things.  The article doesn't mention other things which Reagan often mentions.  He says that the Republicans are inconsistent and only say they are against for stem cell research for political gain and nothing else.  He brings up in-vitro fertilization, in which thousands of embryos are thrown away each year because they aren't used.  Shouldn't the Republicans be against this also if they want to be consistent?  The rest of the article portrays him as an unintelligent baffoon.  They should compare him to Bush, who can't even hold unscripted press conferences.  It's pretty funny...Republicans seem to side with Democrats when an issue actually affects them.  Otherwise, they don't give a rat's ass.  Reagans side with Democrats because of stem cell research, the Bradys because of gun control.....now we just have to wait for Dick to want Civil Unions because his daughter is a lesbian (seriously).  Assholes.

      Pretty damn funny. Here is his site:  urlLink http://maddox.xmission.com/c.cgi?u=bill_oreilly   Article:           Bill O'Reilly is a big blubbering vagina.             For those of you who don't know who Bill O'Reilly is, he's the asshole who wrote this book:                      This guy is the epitome of narcissism, and coming from a guy whose website is titled "The Best Page in the Universe," that's saying a lot. If I had to describe Bill O'Reilly in a phrase, it would be "sock-sniffer." You know the kind of guy who comes home from a long day of work, his feet have been sweating all day, his socks are ripe with the pungent aroma of stale milk and wet leather, and after he finally sits down and takes his socks off, but just before he throws them in the hamper, he takes a quick sniff to sample his odors.           O'Reilly wouldn't be such a bad guy if he would quit crying for a few minutes, step back, re-evaluate his life, and realize that he's a giant blubbering vagina.  In June of 2003, O'Reilly attacked the only form of media he was powerless in: the Internet.  In his "Talking Points Memo" segment, he whined that "nearly everyday, there's something written on the Internet about me that's flat out untrue," continuing with his theory that "the reason these net people get away with all kinds of stuff is that they work for no one.  They put stuff up with no restraints.  This, of course, is dangerous..."  Yeah, real dangerous Bill.  Next thing you know, people will get the crazy idea that they have the right to express their opinions as they see fit.  Who knows?  Maybe this idea will catch on and they'll add it to the Constitution of the United States, giving it a catchy  title like "freedom of speech."  What do you think of that you sock-sniffing bog trotter?         When Bill feels threatened enough, he goes after the people who  say these "vile" things about him.  For example, his much publicized tirade with political satirist Al Franken ended with FOX News lawyers being laughed out of court.         No, Bill, the reason we "get away with all kinds of stuff," other than it being our irrevocable right to do so, is not because we don't work for anyone; it's because if the case against Al Franken taught you anything, you can't do anything about it!  Here's the dilemma Bill O'Reilly faces every day: let the people who attack him on the Internet go, or talk back and give these people publicity.  Al Franken's book probably would have never done so well had FOX not made a fuss about his satirical use of the phrase "FAIR AND BALANCED," and big blubbering Bill won't admit it.         Everything about this guy is obsessive.  He speaks with an obnoxious cadence and rhythm, careful to chant the same handful of phrases over and over again.  His entire repertoire of insults range from the versatile "ideologue" (oh no, don't call me an advocate of a particular ideology, anything but that! Dumbass), to "demonizer," and "ridiculous."  In fact, he repeats these phrases on his show, "The O'Reilly Factor," so many times, you could play a game of Bingo while tuned in.  Simply print out the following sheet and mark a square each time he does or says anything listed. You win when you get 5 in a row (horizontal, vertical or diagonal):                      Bill O'Reilly gets a major chubby every time he says the phrase "fair and balanced."  That's my theory anyway, otherwise he wouldn't say it in spite of the fact that FOX News' slogan is: "we report, you decide."  I love that slogan, because it makes me feel empowered.  They report, I DECIDE!  Wow, it's almost as if I'm being reminded that I still have the capacity for critical thinking, but only insofar as I tune into their network for the delightful and not gruesome Gretta Van Susteren.  Here's a quick question to the executives at FOX News (because I know you assholes will eventually read this): why do you keep calling yourselves "fair and balanced?"  Shouldn't we DECIDE whether or not you're "fair" and/or "balanced"?  Is it even possible to be fair and unbalanced?  Just let it go, it's not witty, it's not clever.  It's not even catchy.  Let it go.         During an interview with NPR's Terri Gross, Bill was quoted as saying: "don't take your ire out on my product because you don't like me."  Hey Bill, isn't that the whole premise behind a BOYCOTT?  Big blubbering Bill chose not to drink Pepsi when they signed rapper Ludacris to do commercials, yet he expects people to go out and buy his shitty new book even if they don't like him (don't take my word for it being shitty, check out what people are saying on Amazon).         Speaking of his shitty new book, there's a quote in it saying "in order to be truly successful you have to be brutally honest with yourself. Excuses and rationalizations have to be put aside. You must define your own life," continuing with the definition he's giving you for your life "[and] not let others do it for you."  Wow, thanks Bill!  You condescending son of a bitch.  As if he wasn't already a giant self-collapsing vortex of hypocrisy, there are literally thousands of other examples I could cite of him "defining" people's lives.  For example, regarding people who support Michael Jackson, he said "all Americans should remain on the sidelines and watch the process."  Oh really?  Does that include you, Bill?  Or are broad sweeping generalizations about what "Americans should do" inapplicable to cranky, joyless blowhards?         Since Bill O'Reilly is such a cry-baby bitch, I have decided to send him a bottle of Johnson & Johnson "no more tears" shampoo, along with a box of tampons to help with his constant PMS:                Update: package sent 2-6-04  Tracking number (usps.com):  0180 5213 9071 8365 1826           I also sent him this letter along with the package:               Dear Mr. O'Reilly,              I hope you find the tampons and shampoo useful. Please continue to enlighten millions of Americans with your fair and balanced journalism day after day.  I know your website is only ranked at 13,553, so if you would ever like some free publicity to help get your site going, I'd be happy to interview you on my site.          Your biggest fan,  Maddox            Careful not to soak up too much Bill, there won't be anything left.

      My sister just arrived back from the Philippines.  I learned quite a bit more about my relatives, even though I have been there before.  My Uncle, a Harvard graduate (prestigious Fulbright scholar as well, owns a highly successful investment firm as well as it's subsidiaries.  He owns one of the skyscrapers in Manila (Actually Makati City, a neighboring city).  Here is a link to his investment firm:  urlLink http://www.fphc.com/board/board_main.htm  .  An interesting thing to note is that EVERYONE on the board of directors is a graduate from Harvard...except for one Filipino and one white guy.  Talk about a powerful company.  Oscar Hiladao is my uncle, by the way.  The first image is from my Uncle's skyscraper.  The tower on the right are where his sons live.  He has several cars.  His house should be on cribs.  I'm gleaming with pride here. My writing style is very seperated and bumpy right now.  Oh well. Another person I'm proud about is my Grandpa.  He has his own statue in the city he governed.  That's another story.         The pic with my sister is at one of the many malls.  She said it was the fanciest mall she's ever seen.  Ever.  It was clearly for the upper class because tshirts were around $50.    There was another mall she went to.  I'm not sure what it is, but it probably was by this company.  http://www.smprime.com.ph/supermalls_.php?id=25  The Mall of Asia is the biggest mall in southeast Asia...and bigger than the Mall of America (biggest mall in the USA).
