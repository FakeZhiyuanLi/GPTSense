      So today I have a lunch appointment with my boss and a radio rep.  On the way, I ask my boss how her day is going.  She begins to rant about who?---the accountant that doesn't like me.  I now have dirt on her.  It seems as though she made a mistake that cost the company $20,000.  But she'll call me out for being 5 minutes late?!?  And then my boss has a daquari at lunch-giving me dirt on her.  Then she tells me about how the owner keeps throwing away money on "hoochey-mamas".  And apparently, he is rubbing it in everyone's face how he recruited me.  And my boss is pissed b/c she thinks it was just luck.  I'm finding the whole 2 1/2 hour lunch to be very exciting.  However, right before lunch, the accountant caught me playing solitaire.  Oh, what an exciting day at work.  Just when I thought everyone was against me, turns out, they are against each other.

      So it happened, new guy who will now be referred to as Mike turned into the jerk he had convinced me he wasn't.  Are my insticts so bad that I can only pick jerks out of a crowded room?  On Friday, he tells me he is sick so he breaks our plans and promises to make it up to me.  On Saturday, he has to work.   On Monday, I call his cell phone and he must have hit against something b/c I can hear him talking to his friends but he obviously doesn't realize there is someone on the phone.  So I hang up and send him a text message.  I hear nothing back.  On Tuesday morning, he replies saying his phone was out of minutes so he couldn't call me last night.  LIE!!  I caught him in a lie.  But I didn't even mention it b/c I really didn't think it was a big deal.  So he goes on and on about how it sucks that he hasn't seen me in a few days, he misses me, blah-blah-blah.  Of course, I gush.  We make plans for Tuesday evening.  At 5:30 he calls and says he has to run a friend to the airport in Dayton--will be back in a couple of hours, we will go to dinner and drinks.  I say cool.  I never hear from him again.  Unless he is dead, that sort of behavior is unacceptable.  How did I get played by a guy that I affectionately called Bhudda?  He was fat, short, bald, and hairy.  Oh, and he had a gap between his teeth.  And he was a waiter!  I did not find him attractive at all but thought he was cool so I went with it.  I was actually proud of myself for being able to look past his looks and his dead end job.  Turns out...I was right.   So what have I learned?  Nothing.  I'm sure I'll do it again w/ another guy next week.  My 27th birthday is in 2 weeks and I think it has me pretty freaked out.  I'm behaving irrationally about a lot of things these days.  I made my first sale at my new job today.  My boss basically handed it to me, so I don't have that sense of accomplishment, however, I do have the commission which I'm sure will make me happy.  I sold a print ad to a crazy evangelist that thinks Democrats are Nazis.  Seriously, he said Nazis.  Oh well.  At least I'm not a democrat.

      New guy did it.  He let me down.  On Friday afternoon, I called him as planned.  He mentioned he was sick and was going to stay home (as you recall, we had plans).  No apologies, nothing.  I said okay and tried to figure out how I was going to spend my Friday night with no plans and no money.  Ended up going out with a friend (the train wreck) and her boyfriend and his friend.  They said they would meet me at 9.  They showed up at 10:15.  We got drunk.  They got into a fight--again.  The cab dropped me off.  I called new guy and yelled at him for 1) not being sorry he was sick and 2) not coming over now.  I imagine it wasn't my most charming moment.   About an hour later...the phone rings.  I immediately think I have won and he is coming over.  I answer the phone and its Train Wreck.  She wants to stay with me and is in a cab on the way over.  I say fine.  I sit on the front porch for 45 minutes waiting for her (where this girls concept of time is, I'll never know).  On the phone, she mentions she has lost her credit card.  By lost she means she left it at the bar.  I have no sympathy b/c I have already returned to one bar tonight to get her credit card. And I have a feeling she is going to try to get me to pay the cab driver.  The cab pulls up and the driver gets out.  She explains to me that he is also coming in.  Can you believe it!?!  So Train Wreck and Cab Driver stay in my living room.  I go to bed with the radio up loud and try to imagine a world with normal friends.  Good news is:  I didn't have to pay the cab fare.  New guy did call on Saturday to see if I needed a ride to go get my car.  That was sweet.  He also called later that night when he got off work but I was already asleep.  I guess he's not that bad.

      Came in today, extremely motivated, ready to get some work done.  Apparently, my office mates felt the need to suck that out of me.  I have had a very unproductive week but made up for it today.  I have accomplished a reasonable amount--probably more than the other 4 put together.   I have decided our accountant thinks she is just the greatest thing to ever walk throught the doors.  While I feel that she is totally competent and trust her with work stuff--her attitude kills me.  Every office has one.   New guy has done everything right.  One Wednesday, I blew him off and went out with my friends.  He didn't get mad.  He actually came and picked me up when I was too drunk to drive home.  Still hasn't tried anything.  Spent the night.  Walked my dog in the morning.  Drove me to my car.  Called last night.  Made plans for tonight.  What's wrong with this guy?

      So I survived work yesterday and was able to work for one hour and make it look like 8.  I consider that one of the biggest success of my career to date.  I imagine that I could be so effective at my job if I were able to maintian that sort of focus consistently.  Instead, I blog, call all of my friends, and evesdrop on office gossip.  Office gossip is one of those things that I truely do not participate in but keep my ear to the ground should I need any information.  I'm finding the stories I hear about myself to be truely amusing here at my new job.  One of girls apparentlly is not a fan of mine.  But at this point, I can say the feeling is mutual, she doesn't know a thing about me (except that I'm not interested in small talk with her), and she'll never rank above me on the corporate ladder.  Actually, I can understand why she doesn't like me then.   The new guy called me at 5:30 yesterday--exactly when he said he would.  He came over to my apartment and we watched tv and took the dog for a walk.  The "let's hang out and not drink and not have sex" thing is strange.  It's just part of his grand plan to make me think he's a really good guy and really likes me.  It's working.  Shit.  The poor guy has no family except a grandma.  His parents have both passed away and he was an only child.  I cannot even imagine what that's like.  Most people's parents don't pass away until they have already gotten married and have their own families.  Even if it doesn't happen like that--there are usually siblings to go through it with you.  It makes me want to call every relative I have and hug them.

      There is a man in my office and no one knows what his job is.  Our office is comprised of 8 employees so this man's role should be evident if not at least announced to us.  Apparently, he is a friend of the owner's who has been fired from his last two broadcasting jobs and will now be helping to destroy our business.  He was introduced to me as a "consultant."  I'm not sure what he is consulting since he hasn't talked to any of us.  Regardless, I find him annoying.  He seems horribly pompus for a man who keeps getting fired.   I've begun blogging in an attempt to avoid actual work.  I'm struggling with a hangover and about 2 hours of sleep.  I have pumped myself full of soda completely blowing my diet in order to avoid falling asleep at my desk--again.  I believe I was actually still drunk when I arrived this morning (15 minutes late).   I went out drinking last night when I shouldn't have.  I blew through my spending money for the week.  I stayed out to late and I believe made an ass of myself.  I'm not sure, I can't really remember.  I feel like it was a pretty fun night though.  Seems like I was surrounded by lots of friends all night.  I do recall dancing but I'm not sure who with.  I took some random guy home with me and we did the whole walk along the river, look at the skyline thing.  Then passed out on my couch.  He has his tongue pierced which I'm sure is what attracted me to him.  I have no idea if he approached me or I approached him.  We'll say he approached me--it makes me feel good.  So the cycle starts.  The one where he likes me and wants to spend lots of time with me.  I don't particulary care, but make time for it.  Then I get attached and he starts to back away.  Eventually, he just stops calling.  I'm left wondering why a guy that I didn't like that much in the first place doesn't like me anymore.  My self esteem just a little bit more destroyed than before.  What a mess.  At least I'm distracted from the others for a while (by others I mean John--the one that I can't stop obsessing over).  I'm ashamed that so much of my mental and emotional capacity is spent on men.
