      A bug  hitched a ride on something  I ate last week and set up shop in  my lower GI tract turning solids into liquids.  A day of the runs is  nothing to worry about, it's even something you might ignore  completely, but after three days, you start to wonder.  I bought some of the medication iâ€™ve heard on commercials all my life, names that were  familiar to me in a vague sort of way but nothing I had ever given any  thought to until now. Now I was rocking back and forth in wallgreens  trying to strengthening my ass cheeks and praying to God (who's got  better things to worry about I'm told) that if I could just hold off  another twenty minutes I'd give up smoking and be a better person and  why the fuck did you make those little bugs anyway? Hunh?! Mylanta,  Immodium AD, pepto-bismal. Chewable tablets and liquid form, I took  them all but nothing worked. I started to hover around the bathroom,  reading a book and waiting for the inevitable, the gurgling noises and  the sudden warm drop at the door of my ass, the last chance to get in  there and go again or i'd ruin another pair of shorts. ( Yes another.  I'd ruined one pair at the beginning of this odyssey when what I thought  was a harmless gas bubble yearning to be free was made up of more than  just gas.) I'd gone five days of this before I grew concerned enough to  seek professional help.  So I called my mom who said to eat bananas and  bread. "Try to clump things up " was her advice. It didn't sound very  scientific but what the hell, she's a nurse and raised four kids, she's  probably seen this before. So I ate only bread and bananas and, sure  enough, shat bread and bananas along with more fluid than I thought I  had in me. ( The human body is amazing. It produces far more than it  ever takes in, kind of like perpetual motion. No matter how long i  starved myself for, I'd still produce! If only it could be converted to  energy) My ass was raw from wiping. I could feel my heartbeat in my  sphincter like you would feel in your thumb after hitting it with a  hammer. I called and made an appointment with a doctor.  I'd hoped that after giving her a detailed account of what I'd been going thru she  could just scribble out a prescription and that would be that. Not so.  "Strip from your waist down" She said. I protested but it was no use,  she wanted to see my ass.  My raw, chapped ass and besides, she's seen  more asses than I would believe. I believed her, i just didn't want to  show it to her. I knew she'd poke around and I was really fine with  being examined, I was just terrified of what would happen if she  prodded too far. My greatest fear was letting lose and spraying the  poor woman. It wasn't unfounded. I knew just how little pressure it  took to open the floodgates and I was afraid that she might activate  it. Luckily, no such thing happened. I rolled on my side, she spread  and gently, gently prodded. "Hmmm, you ARE raw...and I see an old  fissure too." A fissure? A FISSURE?  How the hell did I get that? She  assured me that it was common for someone at my age to have such things  but I felt I had to tell her that I wasn't the type of person to put  things in my ass, if that's what she was thinking. She wasn't. She gave  me a script, fourteen pills of some kind of antibiotic and I drove home  riding sidesaddle. That was yesterday and I'm still waiting for the  pills to work.
