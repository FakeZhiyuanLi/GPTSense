      Hihi. Started this blog when i found tt two of my gd frens L and W had one... mustnt lose out! lol... actually i always wanted to have my own diary, so, here it is. Im Glen, normal Singaporean guy, now in jjc, single, loves chess, pool, animes etc. Now having my June holidays... feel kinda bored and lonely, my gd fren S is leaving soon, so been spending some time with S, then other than tt, been going out occasionally with my old frens like K and D. Haven really bonded with my jc class, no best frens there, so been spending lots of time at home feeling lonely. poor me... my frens too bz for mi... lol  On the hind sight though, this isnt that bad i guess, watched lots of shows i always wanted to watch. Gundam wing, Kill Bill(v nice), Ice age, Band of brothers etc.  Also, recently got this online quiz thingie from a fren. got 2/10 sigh... so bad rite. then i sent one out too, turned out that fren was the only to pass mine... so guilty... haiz :) so must make it up to her somehow i guess, also gave her her bdae present 2 months late. SORRY!!!  Well, i guess ill stop here. To all my friends, stay happy always. cya!

      firstly, to ler, greece's win was not tyco hor... they won by true determination and will. if Singapore had even half the determination they showed, goal 2010 is easy lor. they fully deserve to win, unlike portugal which did not even deserve to go pass the grp stages if not for the stupidity of spain's tactics.  so, recap of the week's events... had chinese ao oral (disaster) and listening compre this week so was quite a sianz week. still having some holiday work to complete and some tests to study for... ARGH!!! but overall, its been an ordinary week. last wednesdae went to yusoff ishak... found that their chess is quite lousy so taught them some basics. this week probably staying back at jj with eva to look after chess club ba... then after tt mayb go watch concert wif old pal roy... c how ba...  but so angry hor... my form teacher mr chan up to now haven give my pw grp back our SECOND(!!!) draft... like wth lor.. haiz lidat lor. haf to go coerce him tml into giving it back ba. well, ok la, gtg slp le. sign off here.

      got some strange comments in my last post, dont quite understand it completely, lol... but i think that hes misunderstood my use of chobits as my blog's title and my last post. shes jst a important fren, dude, and my nicks shinji, not shiniji. =p  these past days, ive finally realised how much losing something can affect you... like they always say, its only when youve lost something that you truly cherish it. but to keep thinking abt it isnt good either. so im gonna get on with life. mayb when shes back next time itll be the same? hope so. but for now, ill cherish the gd frens i have with me now i guess =) life goes on, and to everyone whos lost something, w, f etc... hope you guys cheer up too.  everytime when frens part, they always talk abt how they will keep in touch and everything. but in time, they inevitably forget and things arent the same anymore. this is normally what happens... but i believe that it doesnt have to be this way. you remember me, and ill remember you. everyone is still the same person as when you part ways, why should it be different now? so everyone, always remember those you call your frens. dont regret losing any of them.
