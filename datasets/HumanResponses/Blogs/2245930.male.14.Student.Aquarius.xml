      Well this is another post from the mind of teamy: well big lightning storm really cool another tornado hit somewere around us, and all my  friends are gone or im not at my moms so i cant do stuff with them! it really sucks!!! I was watching oprah the other day and they had bill clinton on (HEY IT WASNT MY IDEA and it wasnt really bad) but billy was talken about how he had to keep 2 seprate lives, one at home and one social but never let them cross. Its like BIG DEAL I KEEP 4 TOTALLY PARRALELL LIVES! one online, one real life social, one at my dads house and one at my moms, and no one ever really knows about whats happing in my other life so whats the big deal with two, kids now-a-days have so much info at there fingertips athat they HAVE to keep a couple of lives. well i g2g this is another thought from the mind of teamy
