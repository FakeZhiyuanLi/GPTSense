       urlLink Tony Blair's Address to Congress 07-17-2003   Again, thinking of Tony Blair brought me back to his speech before Congress a few months ago.  It was one of the most eloquent, moving addresses I had seen in a very long time.  If you read nothing else, take the time to read his words and know that there are people out there in the wider world who do understand what we are trying to do here.

       urlLink Reuters News Article   I feel I must take a moment to salute Tony Blair.  I'll freely admit that when Blair was elected Prime Minister, I detested him as just another Euro-Clinton socialist.  He is a member of the Labour party, and favors an expansion of socialist style big government in the UK.  But Blair has done something that seems to run against the grain of his party and ideology.  He stood up when it was time to be counted, and despite the billowing rage of his own party, he came to our aid when we needed him.  He has quite probably sacrificed his political career on the Iraqi War, and he knows it.  He cast it all aside to do what was right, not what was popular.  How many of us have the strength to have done something like that in our own, smaller lives?  Blair is sticking to his guns, even as 41% of his own party want him to resign.  I can't imagine him surviving another election, and we will all be a little poorer when he does go down.  The example will be made - do what is popular, damn what is right.

       urlLink Dictionary.com/maculate   After hearing a co-worker use the word immaculate, I questioned why nothing is ever described as 'maculate'.  Sure enough, it is a legitimate word.  Please try to push its usage in your personal lives.  Also, give the word 'vincible' a fair shake as well.

       urlLink America?s disappearing factory jobs   This meshes nicely with the earlier NYT editorial on the loss of jobs.  Of course, this piece, being MSNBC, is tainted with assumptions rather than analysis.  These jobs are going, we can't hang on to them without barriers and artificial controls, which will just make things worse.  As individuals, we need to learn these lessons.  We are each a vital part of our own success.  We each need to always be prepared to do something different.  If you aren't learning a new skill, or prepared to face the possibility of chaning jobs, then you are setting yourself up for pain.  There are no gaurentees of an easy life.  We all must be ready to ride the wave and figure out how to survive.  This is not a failing of our country.  On the contrary, the ability to change is one of the strengths of this country.

       urlLink Boom Times on the Poverty Roll   Simply amazing.  THis is one of those rare editorials that literally get me sputtering in rage.  How can such idiocy be written in the 'newspaper of record'?  Our economy has been in transition for ten years now.  Back in 1920, we transition from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing base.  Cities boomed, farms dried up, and workers were displaced as they struggled to retool themselves for a new line of work.  Some couldn't adjust, and bad things happened to them.  IN the middle of this major change, we had the Depression.  Today, we are leaving this manufacturing base behind and moving toward high tech and information.  THis is a fundamental change in our economy, and with it goes turmoil.  It is the nature of capitalism to reallocate resources to new tasks that are more robust and profitable.  As the rest of the world catches up to our manufacturing ability, that skill is in less demand, and resources flow toward the new tasks that give us a competitive advantage - high tech, information, software etc.    It is up to workers to prepare themselves for this new trend.  Gone are the days when you could turn a screw at GM for 30 years and get your retirement pension.  Those days were gone fifteen years ago, but the public still seems to think that those ways should be preserved.  We impose tariffs and trade laws to artificially prop up failing industries, trying to stop the tide of progress.  All we manage to do is make the inevitably adjustment more painful when the crash comes along.  We don't pour steel anymore.  We don't make big metal objects.  The Chinese and Koreans can do it just as well, and for less money.  Preserving these industries is perpetuating poverty and a steadily declining standard of living for those that hang on to the old ways.  As for the rise in poverty numbers, the answer is not to soften the blow of being poor.  We do that too much.  Subsidize, tax credits, free health care, all of this just makes poverty more bearable, without addressing the real issue.  OUr efforts should be focused on stimulating business through tax cuts, incentives and a less rigorous set of laws restraining the ability of business to grow and prosper.  We are doing nothing to increase the demand for labor in this country.  This increased demand will pull people into the workforce, lifting them from poverty.  This is much more effective than handing out even more money without changing the nature of our economy.  Let companies fail.  Let whole industries go out of business.  Provide some basic help to those trying to make the transition, but at the same time, allow new industries to have a go at it.  It is going to be painful, and difficult, and some aren't going to make it, but facing reality is much more effective than postponing the crash and allowing it to multiply.  My father told me an interesting story this weekend.  He works for a non-union company that will come to a factory on the behalf of a supplier and help deal with the suppliers bad parts on site.  Sort of a mobile Quality group that saves time by working on the parts at the plant, rather than having to ship the bad parts all the way back to the supplier for repair.  A union shop had received a batch of parts that turned out to be defective.  They needed to be sorted, so my dad's company was called in to do the work.  They were denied entry into the union facility because they were not union themselves.  The parts were not sorted, and had to be shipped back to the supplier.  As a result, the plant shut down because of a part shortage.  The union employees were laid off for a week because of thier policy of preventing non-union workers from entering 'thier' plant.  And we want to defend and subsidize this behavior?

       urlLink OpinionJournal - Featured Article   It seems some politicians of both parties wants to change the Iraqi rebuilding expenditures into a loan.  As the story points out, with a crushing $130 billion in loans owed to France, Germany and Russia (the three countries that opposed the war....blood for oil anyone?), piling on even more debt is not the way to build a prosperous, healthy Iraq.  Did we learn nothing from Versaille?  Miring Iraq in debt bondage is not going to win hearts and minds.

       urlLink OpinionJournal - Featured Article   I missed this one yesterday and Mike pointed it out.    I've been running into a lot of reports from soldiers coming home, or independent journalists, or even democratic Congressmen echoing the Secretary.  The situation in Iraq is going quite well, despite the wailing and moaning of the media.    I'm really starting to believe, as I watch poll numbers erode, that the media is playing with fire here.  We have been in Iraq for 6 months.  It took 6 years to pacify Japan, and fifteen years to completely reassemble Europe.  If we were in post WWII with this media climate, those areas of the world would still be in ruins, breeding hatred.    If the media manages to destroy our will to do what must be done, then we are in sorry shape for the future.  No problems will be addressed unless they can be solved in days, rather than months, and the lords at the New York Times will have a disproportionate amount of power.  The media serves a valuable end, and they should have the freedom to report news that does not conform to the party line of the government.  But this freedom comes with responsibility.  Fortunately, we have outfits like Fox News that are starting to get back to fair, open journalism.  Judging by their ratings, the public is hungry for news, not editorial.

       urlLink The Energy Bill Gets Worse   The New York Times vents their spleen about energy policy.  Funny how the left wails and cries about our involvement in the Middle East, while at the same time standing in the way of severing our dependence on this part of the world.  They won't let us extract the oil present in this country, so we must continue to buy from foreign suppliers.  They won't let us persue nuclear power as a viable alternative, forcing us to burn the dreaded fossil fuels.  The advocate matchbox cars that couldn't get a ticket in a school zone, and then act shocked when no one wants to buy them.    Energy is the engine of freedom.  Conservation is not going to save us.  Renewable sources are a noble thing to pursue, but right now we need our own sources of power.  Start drilling!  Sever our dependence on OPEC.  Let the middle east dry up and return to the desert.

       urlLink The "Poor"   My apologies, this was taken from a conversation with Todd. I did not refute the article fully, but this is another of the Fundamental Truths according to me.  I have noticed the term "progressive" showing up more and more. The Dems need to hijack another term for their use. It seems that simply being who they are is not good enough to get them back in power. So they ha to hide behind masks and lies.   "For further proof that wealthy Americans are getting richer while the poor multiply, watch for a report by the Census Bureau on Sept. 26 that will show the poverty rate and income gap rising."  A more useful stat would be the median income of Americans tracked over a 50-year period. And the percentages spent on basic essentials versus luxuries.  "With tax cuts for the wealthy and cruel budget cuts for social safety net programs, some believe the poverty rate for 2002 is really closer to the Bush I regime figure, that the Republicans are playing with figures and that the bureau's estimates fall far short of reality. "  How can anyone jump so far in their ilogic? So cutting handouts and actually leaving money in the hands of those who earned it somehow increases the total number of those in poverty? I would love to hear a full explanation of this, but it will never come. We are expected to draw a conclusion from the fact that the amount of "poor" have risen and the amount of money wealthy posess has also risen. But honestly, it would be a catastrophe if the wealthy did not continue to build wealth. It's what they DO. If they couldn't do it they wouldn't remain wealthy.  "Cities like Phoenix, Miami, Los Angeles and Chicago reported increases of around 50 percent between January 2001 and July 2003. Homeless shelters are overcrowded; in 2002, the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported that 30 percent of all requests for shelter went unmet."  Maybe the cities have opened the floodgates themselves by offering too many handouts. Beggars will no go where there is no mark to panhandle from. This is not Depression-era suffering. This is a bunch of drug addicts and people who choose to live this way. Illiterate Mexians can come here and live fairly comfortably. What excuse to these bums have?  "Those trends particularly increased in the first six months of 2003, as Bush's cruel budget cuts and tax increases for the poor took greater effect, Shaft wrote. Some 60 percent of new homeless cases targeted single mothers with children in 2003. "  We know what this means. Welfare mothers. Mothers who have had children that they knew they couldn't afford. I say this should stop. Why pay for more unfit mothers? Why create more sub-optimal families? And Bush never increased taxes on the poor. They don't pay any federal taxes, yet they recieve the greatest portion of aid. This system has a name, and the name is Communism. "Each according to his ability, each according to his need." - Karl Marx.  "Other causes are the continued onslaught of corporate layoffs, which have slowed only slightly this year over the torrid pace of 2001 and 2002, and the decline in value of the minimum wage, which has fallen by 25 percent since 1975. "  This is no excuse. Make do with less. Welcome to real life! Many poor immigrants have to live together, in cramped conditions. But they do not actually seek this existence. They see it as a stepping stone to prosperity. The problem with the "poor" is that they are poor in mind and spirit, not in money. Money does not make one rich. It is the person who is rich or poor. Donald Trump would be  wealthy again in short order if he was suddenly penniless. He knows how to make money, and he seeks it constantly. The "poor" seek poverty. They have made and continue to make poor choices because they are more expedient. Buying lotto tickets is not going to make you rich. Nor is a Firebird. Nor is a gold tooth. Becoming more inherintly valuable is the only real path to wealth.  By coddling these people who seek to be poor, we only perpetraate their lifestyle. If being poor was truly a hardship, there would be far fewer poor people.

      The Importance of the Individual -  I think the Nation is the single best way to keep freedom alive. We must have spereate areas for seperate cultures. Where would we be if the great people of the USA were not concentrated in this one area? Notice what Rome, Greece, Britain all did even though they were small? It seems it is not numbers but quality that matter most.  I oppose Socialism because it strikes at the root of human existence. The individual is the most important thing, not the group. If we cease to be individuals we are doomed. A nation, a group of individuals can do mighty deeds. A nation of groups, or one group is a weak and easily-led thing. The mob does no great deeds, it can only destroy.  The great deeds of history were accomplished because some men made themselves great. Then they led others. It was not the mass that made great deeds possible. Without men like Scipio or Marius or Caesar there would be no Rome. When men like these could no longer be found the Empire fell. Even though the lives of the group were better, the goal of men to become great by virtue rather than by expediency was removed.  Socialists would destroy the very rewards and environment that allows great men to emerge and dominate events. To me that is evil, and should never be allowed to happen. Making someone a slave is part of that process. Forcing people to provide a good or service is slavery. Owning one's production is owning one's life. When you cannot own what you make, how can it be worth making anything?   The simple fact of the matter is that the group is not as important as the individual. A great man is worth more than ten lesser men. But Socialists would hae you believe that all men are equal. It is obvious that this is not the case. A janitor's production is not of the same value as a neurosurgeon's. Yet socialists would force the neurosurgeon to serve the janitor. While I do not want anyone to die needlessly, I would rather see some die than others be forced into slavery. It is only by improving the self that we can raise up the group.   When this nation was founded, it happened that a great convergence of amazing individuals occured. These men were able to fashion the longest enduring political system on the face of the earth. No group did this. Men like John Adams and Thomas Jefferson accomplished this. They should be remembered and aspired to.   If America does not return to individualism and throw of this sjhackle of group responsibilty, we will fall by the wayside as surely as all the other great powers have.

      I think I just need to give Don posting privilege on the Blog.  His emails are always fun.  Email starts. One more thing. Did you here the latest death toll from the European heat  wave? 19,000. And 11,000 in France. You made a comment on how expensive  their energy cost are over there and I wonder if that really had a hand in  so many deaths. Also I guess in Europe August is  holiday month for a lot of  doctors, but to let 19,000 folks die due to a shortage of docs seems  ridicules. From what I have read on the subject the French are once again  being criticize for their slow reaction to a crisis. Lets make a list: WWI,  WWII, Southeast Asia, and the current crisis over in Iraq. Had the French  reacted a little faster or reacted at all in both WWI and WWII things may  have been a bit different. And time will tell if they would have been a  factor at all in Iraq. The only thing the French are quick to react to is  the critisism of G. W. Bush, the U.S.A. and bad wine. Have 19,000 people  died yet in the war against Iraq? How many had Saddam killed? Maybe if the  U.S. had the French support nobody would have died. Thats a pretty strong  statement on a second rate socialistic country. But like I said time will  tell.  End Email.  Viva le France!  Haugh haugh haugh!

       urlLink The Failure to Find Iraqi Weapons   Again, the left seems to be advocating the old concept that we must absorb the first punch. Why is it that the left is willing to sacrifice Americans to the fire just to make them feel better about engaging in the horrors of war?  Are the lives of our citizens so cheap?  As I tire of pointing it out, I say again, 9/11 changed everything.  We cannot afford to wait for the nuclear flash over a major city before we decide to address the problem.  The nuclear deterrent worked with the Soviet Union, and works with China, because these nations are sane, and understand the consequence of a nuclear exchange.  The radical terrorist cares not for sanity, nor consequence.  How can a rational person continue to argue that we must wait for the first strike before we exercise ourselves in defense?  Those that argue that Saddam was no threat can easily see their same argument ported over to apply to al Qaeda on 9/10.  They were no threat.  The very idea that a bunch of thugs in caves could threaten this country was laughable.  In the light of what was accomplished by thugs, how can they argue that a nation with resources such as Iraq could NEVER strike at us without warning?  The actual presence of WMD in Iraq continues to be irrelevant.  The burden of proof was with Saddam, and he failed to produce evidence that he disarmed (which I don't think he did, I think the weapons are there).  It isn't up to us to ferret out the proof.  Someone said it - "Inspectors inspect, they aren't detectives searching for clues."    The Bush Doctrine of Pre-Emption is sane and just.  These are extraordinary times.  If we still lived in 1850, when the organizational ability and military might of a nation was needed to provide a clear and present danger, then pre-emptive wars are folly.  The stakes are too high today, and failure to recognize that dooms us all to eventual destruction.    Moral clarity frightens the left.  They live in a world of equivalence and ambivalence.  They can't stand the thought of certainty, and the Bush Doctrine is grounded in simple, black and white concepts.  This nation is worth protecting, our civilization holds this world together in relative peace, and we will do whatever it takes, regardless of the cost to defend it.  Those that stand in the way cannot be coddled.  We will not harm those that sit out the fight, but those that refuse to help have forfeited any expectation of relevancy.  This war is black and white, and stark as the struggle against Facism in the 40s.  Forget the foggy concepts of the Left's favorite war, Viet Nam.  Throw out the moral relativism of 'one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter'.    And finally, can we get the hell over Viet Nam?  The lessons of that war have been learned, by all except for the very people who created Viet Nam in the first place - the radical left and the media.  They are the ones who forced the misguided policy of a 'managed' war.  They gave us political control of military targeting.  The constant drumbeat of negativity drove us away from a war we were winning.  We didn't loose Viet Nam, we left early.  Fact is, we were crushing the enemy in every major engagement.  Withoute erosion of our willingness to do what must be done, the North had no chance.  Kind of like Somalia.  The incidents in Black Hawk Down were created through managed rules of engagement dictated by the politicians who were averse to risk.  Those men were not given armor support because of the tender sensibilities of the 'Arab Street'.  Our politicians were not willing to weather the storm of foreign opinion, and limited out troops ability to protect themselves.    If we are in this war, we need to be in it completely, and the rest of the world can go to hell if they don't like it.  We don't answer to Europe.  Leaders aren't always popular, but popularity is the last thing you should be concerned about as a leader.  Get the job done.  Do what is right.  History will judge.

      Mel Gibson an anti-semite?  Don sent me a rant this morning and it made me laugh, so I had to share it.  Email starts Did you hear? Mel Gibson is an anti-Semite. He made a movie based on the  gospel of St. John about the life and death of Jesus. Come on people, are ya  fucking kidding me? The jews killed Jesus. Jesus had to die, if He was not  killed there would be no atonement for sin.  Like it or not He had to die  for our sins. That's what I believe. How can the Jewish people say this  movie will promote anti-Semitism. Jesus was a Jew. They haven't seen the  movie yet. And you don't have to see it to knows how it ends. Everybody  knows how it ends. I bet you even know how it ends (joke). And it can't be  much better than the best selling book ever. I just watched the O'Reilly  factor. It's like the Jews are playing the Holocaust card again for whatever  reason. Like we will forget that happened. It's a movie. Just a movie. If  they are so concerned maybe some Jews should get together and do a happier  version of the film."Jesus Goes to Jerusalem", "Miracle at the Wailing  Wall". Hell remake the "Ten Commandments" Someone just did  "The Texas  Chainsaw Massacre" again, why the hell not! I haven't seen the film myself,  it's not out yet but please if you are going to critisize someone and throw  out words like anti-semite like your feeding bread to the pigeons make damn  sure there is truth to it. The way I see it if the Jews had not been  instumental in the death of Jesus, if Pilot had listened to his wife, I and  millions of others would probably be Jewish. So the Jew should be the  anti-semite and hate themselves for helping to create Christianity. Anyway have a good weekend.  End Email  I would actually like to see this movie.  Anything that can provoke reactions will at least be interesting.  Personally, I don't see what the fuss is about.  Like Don said, the Christians should be walking around thanking the Jews for being so central to the creation of thier faith.  But even so, holding the 'Jews' responsible as a whole is like harboring hatred for the English over the burning of the White House in 1812, or for Muslims hating the West over the Crusades....uh, okay, never mind that one.  It really seems silly.  But I respect Gibson for sticking to his guns.  He shows courage and certainly has strength in his faith to produce such a film, especially as a Hollywood actor.  No doubt, the entire Hollywood phonebook hates him now, since he has done such a terrbile thing like express faith in God.

       urlLink Universal Declaration of Human Rights    The whole UN situation is really frosting me this morning.  People seem to get all warm and fuzzy over the UN, imagining some Star Trek utopia where we all live in peace and prosperity under the loving hand of the Secretary-General.  No one really takes the time to examine what the UN stands for, and how their aims are not in the best interest of the United States.  Here is a link to the UN Universal Rights of Man.  Sounds like a noble document?  I’ll admit that a good portion of it is a solid call for basic human rights, similar to our own founding documents.  For the most part, Articles 1-21 are fairly decent, but I would still have some minor issues in wording.  A good example is Article 17.  Article 17. (1) Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others. (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.  What does ‘arbitrarily’ mean?  So long as you have a process defined, you can strip property from people?  Unfortunately, that is the existing case in America, so my problem here extends beyond the UN.  Anyway, the real horror of this document starts with Article 22.    Article 22. Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.  A Right (capital R) is a thing that exists without the free effort of another man to make it exist.  You have the Right to Life, Freedom, Happiness etc.  No one has to do anything to make this happen.  A Right cannot enslave someone else to force them to provide it for you.  Therefore, there is no Right to Healthcare, no Right to Education, no Right of Social Security.  These so called Rights require someone else to provide a service, regardless of your ability to compensate that individual for said service.  It is essentially permission to enslave someone.  This Article requires a nation to force citizens to provide for the well being of other citizens, and while they may be paid for the service, the funds to pay will be extracted by force from the populace.  And how does one define an appropriate level of dignity and free development?  Who makes that decision? Article 23. (1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. (2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. (3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection. (4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.  Again, no one has the Right to employment.  To realize this Right, someone else is forced to provide a job.  Same for protection against unemployment.  While the idea sounds noble, compulsion is not the answer.  Section 3 requires just and favorable remuneration.  Who shall determine ‘just and favorable’?  How will this be enforced?  It even calls for supplements for those who don’t make this ‘just and favorable’ amount.  Who shall provide the supplement?  The way to properly insure good working conditions and the availability of jobs is to ensure economic conditions that create a high demand for labor.  Employers competing for labor will provide good conditions, high pay, and benefits.  Mandating these conditions by the government enslaves us all to arbitrary ideas. Article 24. Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay.  Again, a properly vigorous economy will be sufficient to provide this benefit.  Through a mandate, the UN is requiring the employer to provide a Right at his own expense, and perhaps against his will. Article 25. (1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. (2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection.  This is simply a nightmare!  How are these Rights defined?  Now, simply for being born, someone has to provide me with a standard of living, food, clothing, housing, medical, unemployment, disability, life insurance and a pension.  And I am required to do – nothing!  And if I am a mother, I have the Right of special care.  Again, who will provide this?  From whom am I permitted to steal in order to fulfill my own Rights?  Someone must provide, whether they wish it or not.  I am entitled to my own cadre of slaves. Article 26. (1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. (2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. (3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.  Education cannot be free, since someone has to pay for it.  I don’t care what stage it is.  The idea that education shall be ‘equally accessible to all based on merit’ is a contradiction in terms.  It is either equally accessible, or it is merit based.  It cannot be both!  Which trumps the other?  And note that ‘Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.’  What of dissent?  What of those that do not believe in these human rights?  An education is not intended to program and propagandize.  An education is the free examination of all ideas, with an independent conclusion by the student.  At least in terms of social and political issues, the hard sciences are something else entirely, but this Article seems more concerned with promoting its own ideas through a compulsory educational system rather than assuring a useful, practical education.  I love the line – ‘and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.’  It simply drips with totalitarian control. Article 27. (1) Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits. (2) Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.  So I have the Right to freely participate in cultural life?  What does that mean?  This is really trivial, and it cheapens the concept of a Right by including it here.    Article 28. Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized.  This one I think is more for the protection of this very Document.  Essentially, no competing system will be permitted to exist, as we all have the Right to this Document, and this Document alone.    Article 29. (1) Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible. (2) In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. (3) These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.  This one might as well have been written by Satan.  Everyone has duties to the community, and it is the community alone that enables the development of his personality.  Our slavery to the state is institutionalized.  Anything they wish to take from us can be justified through our duty to the community.  The masses are sovereign over the individual.  Section 2 states that our freedoms are only nullified by the ‘just requirements of morality, public order, and the general welfare in a democratic society.’  I won’t go into an anti-democracy tirade here, since I lake the room, but the very concept of nullification of a Right based on the ‘public good’ is anathema to an American.  My Rights do not stem from the permission of others.  They come from Higher, and even though I do not believe in the God of organized religion, the concept of Divine Right is still relevant to me.  My Rights are not given by man.  And they aren’t given by the State.  The general welfare of public opinion cannot restrain my fundamental Rights, and to suggest that they can be nullified is the vilest thing I can imagine.  And section 3 is the kicker.  No rights can be exercised contrary to the principles of the United Nations.  They have established an arbitrary sovereignty over all of Humanity.  They trump everyone else.  The Founding Documents of the United States do not make such allowances.  Our Rights, are TRUE Rights as enumerated in the Bill of Rights, cannot be deprived in most cases.     The very concept of Rights has been bastardized to the point where we speak of the Right to Prescription Drugs, or the Patients Bill of Rights.  No Rights exist outside of the fundamental expressed in the Bill of Rights.  No one must act to give me my Rights, since my Rights are not man made.    Be wary of the UN.

       urlLink Bush&#8217;s U.N. fiasco   I read the Bush address word for word on-line, and I don't understand where Fred Kaplan is coming from.  I suspect the real issue with the left is that Bush didn't get down on his knees and cry for forgiveness.    We did the right thing in Iraq.  We are still doing the right thing, and the situation is far from the description we get from the media outlets.  A second democrat congressman has wrote a piece similar to the piece I linked the other day.  Gallup released a poll today taken in Iraq that mirrored the Zogby poll of last week.  Iraq is getting better, one step at a time.  As for this idea that the only answer is a UN answer, I simply don't understand.  How can a 'solution' drawn up by a large group that do not share a common interest be better than a focused effort to pacify Iraq?  The coalition one objective, primarily - turn Iraq into a free nation that does not threaten the world.  The UN has little interest in building a free nation.  Look at the membership of the UN!  Over half of the member states do not have representative government.  At least a third are open dictatorships.  How are these people any better than us when it comes to erecting a free government in Iraq?  George Will had the best line - "The UN Security Council is a World War II victory parade frozen in time."  It is quickly becoming irrelevant.

      I was reading the speech that Bush gave today in front of the UN, when I came across the transcript of Kofi Annan's comments.  I excerpted this passage.  It is quite interesting to hear him chastise the UN for thier handling of Iraq.  While he gives us a swipe as well, overall, this is more than I expected from Annan.  Begin Excerpt  Since this Organisation was founded, States have generally sought to deal with threats to the peace through containment and deterrence, by a system based on collective security and the United Nations Charter. Article 51 of the Charter prescribes that all States, if attacked, retain the inherent right of self-defence. But until now it has been understood that when States go beyond that, and decide to use force to deal with broader threats to international peace and security, they need the unique legitimacy provided by the United Nations. Now, some say this understanding is no longer tenable, since an “armed attack” with weapons of mass destruction could be launched at any time, without warning, or by a clandestine group. Rather than wait for that to happen, they argue, States have the right and obligation to use force pre-emptively, even on the territory of other States, and even while weapons systems that might be used to attack them are still being developed. According to this argument, States are not obliged to wait until there is agreement in the Security Council. Instead, they reserve the right to act unilaterally, or in ad hoc coalitions. This logic represents a fundamental challenge to the principles on which, however imperfectly, world peace and stability have rested for the last fifty-eight years. My concern is that, if it were to be adopted, it could set precedents that resulted in a proliferation of the unilateral and lawless use of force, with or without credible justification. But it is not enough to denounce unilateralism, unless we also face up squarely to the concerns that make some States feel uniquely vulnerable, and thus drive them to take unilateral action. We must show that those concerns can, and will, be addressed effectively through collective action. Excellencies, we have come to a fork in the road. This may be a moment no less decisive than 1945 itself, when the United Nations was founded. At that time, a group of far-sighted leaders, led and inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, were determined to make the second half of the twentieth century different from the first half. They saw that the human race had only one world to live in, and that unless it managed its affairs more prudently, all human beings might perish. So they drew up rules to govern international behaviour, and founded a network of institutions, with the United Nations at the centre, in which the peoples of the world could work together for the common good. Now we must decide whether it is possible to continue on the basis agreed then, or whether radical changes are needed. And we must not shy away from questions about the adequacy, and effectiveness, of the rules and instruments at our disposal. Among those instruments, none is more important than the Security Council itself. In my recent report on the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, I drew attention to the urgent need for the Council to regain the confidence of States, and of world public opinion – both by demonstrating its ability to deal effectively with the most difficult issues, and by becoming more broadly representative of the international community as a whole, as well as the geopolitical realities of today. The Council needs to consider how it will deal with the possibility that individual States may use force “pre-emptively” against perceived threats. Its members may need to begin a discussion on the criteria for an early authorisation of coercive measures to address certain types of threats – for instance, terrorist groups armed with weapons of mass destruction.  End excerpt.

       urlLink End of a rags-to-shocking-riches tale   I haven't had the chance to speak about this, but I feel I should.  The whole story angers me to no end.  In case you haven't been following, the Chairman of the NYSE, Grasso, received a $140 million dollar payout recently.  This caused an uproar, and subsequently, Grasso was forced to resign.  Why do we seem to have a problem when it comes to compensating someone for the work they do?  Why do we jump up and down and talk about 'unseemly' amounts of money, or 'fairness'?  If there was something illegal about this payout, then fine, investigate it.  But in this case, Grasso has earned this money over a 36 year career, essentially starting at one of the lowest levels and working his way up.  The attached article attests to his skills in guiding the NYSE to a prosperous era, yet the public is outraged that he is paid for his work?  Over a 36 year career, Grasso's retirement package piled up, eventually reaching the $140 million mark, plus another $48 million in deferred compensation that he wrongly turned down.  That amounts to around $3.8 million a year in retirement.  Listen, if the NYSE is running my retirement account, I EXPECT them to get a large rate of return!  There is nothing wrong with this.  This is American Success, defined!  Yet the class warfare, anti-achievement mentality has managed to marshal enough anger to force Grasso to resign.  No tears for him, as he has enough money to live well - but it still shouldn't have happened.  How many hungry people have been fed by the resignation of Grasso?  How many poor people clothed?  How many opportunities improved?  The persecution of Grasso has done nothing, other than normalize the concept that there is such a thing as 'too much salary'.  The very concept is absurd.  The market has dictated Grasso's pay, just as it dictates my pay, and your pay.  We are worth the money we can make through legal means, and that is what this country is all about.  You have no obligation to another man when it comes to the money you earn.  It simply is no one else's business.    The social collective won another battle with the Grasso Affair.  Now we must evaluate the sensibilities of the teeming masses when it comes to compensating people for a fine job.  Isn't that what a Union is all about?

      This came along from Don as well.  I'm going to post it because it is a vile, senseless example of the kind of thing we should NOT be tolerating as Americans.  It really is demeaning to the person who circulates it, and reflects on the rest of us if we tolerate it.  Idiots who write this have the freedom to do so, but they should be ostracized by reasonable men.  Post follows: Everyone seems to be wondering why Muslim terrorists are so quick to commit suicide.  Let's see now:    No Jesus,   No Walmart,   No television,   No cheerleaders,   No baseball,   No football,   No basketball,   No hockey,   No golf,   No tailgate parties,   No Home Depot,   No pork BBQ,   No hot dogs,   No burgers,   No lobster,   No shellfish, or even frozen fish sticks,   No gumbo, No jambalaya.    More than one wife.   Rags for clothes and towels for hats.   Constant wailing from the guy next-door because he's sick and there are no doctors.   Constant wailing from the guy in the tower.    No chocolate chip cookies.   No Christmas.   You can't shave.   Your wives can't shave.   You can't shower to wash off the smell of donkey cooked over burning camel dung.   The women have to wear baggy dresses and veils at all times.    Your bride is picked by someone else.    She smells just like your donkey, but your donkey has a better disposition.    Then they tell you that when you die it all gets better!    I mean, really, IS THERE A MYSTERY HERE ??   End Post.  The radical Muslims in the Middle East want to keep their people living in the twelfth century, but the average Muslim is just as deserving of liberty and freedom as anyone else.  I detest those that say Iraq is not ready for freedom, or that freedom and a Republican Government is foreign to the Arab mind.  These are human beings, trapped up in a backwards, ignorant faith that needs reform.  As human beings, they are deserving of dignity and respect, and we are trying to provide that through the blood of our own.  Sure, there is a powerful self interest in our actions over there, but in the long run, none of us are safe until all men are free.

      Don "The Islamic Scholar" Barda dropped me a line this morning.    Todd after doing the little bit of research that I have done I'm starting to  believe your right. Islam needs to sit back, take a look at themselves and  fix the fucking problem. I can't see how a westerner of average intelligence  could convert to this religion. I am by no means an expert but this religion  seems to me to be full of contradictions and excuses. I, however, do not  agree with people hating a person do to there believe in Islam. We had a  little problem back in the 30's and 40's that dealt with the hate issue,  that I can see happening today (to a much lesser degree). I'll send you an  e-mail that I received last night that is reminiscent of Nazi propaganda.  I'm not trying to defend Islam I'm trying to understand it. One of the points brought up in that link I sent you, (The A to Z of Islam)  that I laughed at was their environmental cause. Don't know if you read that  part. If it is of great concern to a Muslim to protect the environment why  in Allah's name do they sell their oil, filthy, dirty, polluting oil. Anyway I'm sure you are getting tired of my e-mails on Islam. I'll try to  comment more but I think the links speak for themselves. Will you be in Toledo this weekend? Let me know. If not have a good weekend. One more thing how do you get any work done, the work you get paid for?  End Email  To answer the questions in the lowest order of importance.  I will not be in Toledo this weekend.  Maybe next weekend.  As for work, I have been fortunate in my life to hold jobs that seem to come with free time.  Blogging really doesn't take much added effort, as I usually package up my comments and fire them off in email form anyway.  Now I'm just putting them in one place to make it easier for my friends to ignore.    I agree with Barda-man when he says we shouldn't hate a Muslim due to their faith.  There is a growing tide of broad condemnation of all Muslims, and that sort of thing has no place in our society.  However, I still have a problem with the current state of their faith, and their seeming unwillingness to reform.  A Muslim does not deserve my scorn until they act in a manner that is scornworthy.  They are innocent until proven otherwise.  That being said, we can't overlook the fact that Muslim terrorists are responsible for a lot of Bad Things.  To ignore this fact is foolish and dangerous.  Profiling is a proper practice, and while I sympathize with the law abiding Arab-American, there isn't much we can do to protect his sensibilities.  A quiet security check is proper.  Open scorn and harassment is certainly not.    I have been fortunate enough to have encountered many people of different nationalities and faiths in my working life.  These encounters have almost always been enjoyable, and certainly fascinating.  I've learned a lot, and had some illusions dispelled.  My issues are not with Muslims who seek a peaceful existence with the West.  But my issues with Islam  as practiced today in the Middle East  cannot be easily dropped.  Keep it going Don.  I really enjoy hearing about what you have discovered.

       urlLink CNN.com - Recall proponents urge court to let election proceed - Sep. 17, 2003   I don't believe I've weighed in on the recall in California.  I think I might surprise some people.  I think the recall is wrong, and I would vote to retain Gray-Out Davis.  A recall process should not be in the hands of the people.  We have a process for that in the federal Constitution, called impeachment, and the states would do well to follow that example.  A direct recall smacks too much of Democracy, and Democracy is fundamentally an evil force.  The progression towards Democracy in California will eventually spell doom for the state, and by extension, severe damage to this country.  Unfortunately, the entire nation has been drifting toward the concept of Democracy for a very long time now.  Even Republicans use the term Democracy when describing our country, and it hurts me every time I hear it.  Democracy destroys every nation that has ever embraced it.  With apologies to Neal Boortz, this is from his site.  "A pure democracy can admit no cure for the mischief's of faction.  A common passion or interest will be felt by a majority, and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party.  Hence it is, that democracies have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have, in general, been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths."  James Madison.  That being said, like it or not, the recall is in the California Constitution and carries the force of law.  The actions of the Ninth Circuit panel in blocking the recall is the first time in the history of the country where a judicial body has cancelled an election.  Did you feel the ground move?  This is a watershed moment in our history, when the federal judiciary feels confident enough to meddle in the only element of our government that should be held sacred - the right to elect a representative.  (Note, this is vastly different from the concept of Democracy.)  Thanks to Bush V Gore and the Florida mess, the door to litigation in election has been thrown wide open.  I told my father in the midst of the Florida recount that this moment will be marked in history as the start of our decline as a nation.  The unassailable had been assailed.  The line that could not be crossed, was.  And now every election can be tossed into the courts, until the system becomes so distorted and untrustworthy, the very fabric of our nation will tear.    The ninth circuit is the most overturned court in the nation.  They gave us the PLedge of allegiance ruling.  They aren't really better than the Florida Supreme Court, who started this mess through a naked attempt at violating equal protection by counting some votes and not others.  Ironically, the Ninth Circuit has used Bush V Gore to cancel this election, but the application is bad law.  Bush V Gore applied to the narrow question of recounts.  It does not apply, and the Supremes took great care to spell this out, to the actual act of voting.  To cancel an election over the 'potential' of failed machines makes the argument that it is better to disenfranchise 50 million people rather than a few thousand.  If the precedent is set that a perfect voting mechanism is required before you can have an election, what is the threshold for perfect?  Can ANY election be trusted under that standard?  I should note that the panel of judges was appointed by Presidents who had been elected with the same voting machines.  So do these judges hold their posts legitimately?

       urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | Saudis consider nuclear bomb   I was a bit groggy this morning until I saw this.  Better than coffee.  All the more reason to seek energy independence.  Until we can cut the cord with the Saudis, we will have a difficult time reacting to these developments.  I don't believe the world can allow a nuclear power to rise up in this region.  Israel exempted of course.  They share western values, and we have nothing to fear from them.

       urlLink thetruereligion.org - A-Z of Islam   Don sent this link in, and I attached his comments.  Here is their message.... This is Islam A to Z. Found it interesting thought you would to. Not that I am a scholar of Islam now but it seems to me that the Qur'aan makes it easy to change what Allah wants or that anything that is not covered in the book is covered by the Sunnah or Muhammads (PBUH)sayings/traditions. I thought the whole concept was religion is for Allah alone. So why is a man connecting the dots? Know what I mean? And how does an illiterate man write the Qur'aan anyway?  I haven't spend a lot of time with it yet, but a quick glance reveals a determined effort to defend Islam as a Great Religion.  No surprise.  Perhaps back in its day, Islam was a Great Faith.  They preserved knowledge, protected religious minorities, and were an advanced civilization.  And then something happened to give us what we have today.    The link above claims religious tolerance, reverence for women, praise for Christians, and a tradition of science.  Fine.  So explain to me the widespread violence in the Muslim world?  Explain the backwardness of the Islamic culture?  Explain the human rights abuse?  I don't bring it up out of malice.  I need these answers.  I can't accept the above claims of greatness when the examples run counter to the statements.

       urlLink CNN.com - BBC Iraq reporter admits errors - Sep. 17, 2003   The media, in my opinion, is a big part of the problem when it comes to spinning public perception with little regard to truth.  There are so many commonly accepted 'facts' that are really nothing more than hysteria.  Like the 'fact' that Bush lied about Iraq's attempt to procure uranium from Niger.  In truth, BUsh reported a British Intelligence source that made that claim, and even qualified that statement by saying it was the belief of the British Government.  That was somehow twisted into "Bush lied!".    The media bears an awesome responsibility to question and report on what is going on.  They are important enough to warrant their own mention in the Constitution.  The responsibility also requires a solemn respect of their duty, which they seem to lack.  The media needs to report facts, not spin facts to suit their political agenda.  Why is it that most journalists are to the left?  A recent poll of journalists revealed 80% voted for Gore.  Scratch a reporter, and you find an activist.  I understand human nature, and it is unreasonable to expect true objectivity.  I can live with that, I suppose.  I just wish they would stop pretending to be non-partisan.

       urlLink Burger King plans health-food menu   Burger King doesn't get it.  Low fat foods do NOT make you loose weight.  In order to make up the flavor lost through reduced fat, food makers increase the carbohydrate content.  Take a look at any food in the grocery store and compare labels between normal and low-fat versions.  The carbs are always higher.  Fat in food does not make you fat.  Your body stores fat when fat is not readily available in the diet.  Would you store water in buckets all over the house when you have a faucet?    If Burger King and others wanted to provide real healthy food, they would create an Atkins menu.  And they would have my business instantly.

       urlLink The Chilrun Win Again   I am furious. Such a low turnout means that they teacher's unions succeeded in keeping the vote a secret again. I only learned of the vote when i passes my polling place and found the signs "Vote Here!" I of course voted to save my family hundreds of dollars next year in taxes.   I can't possibly relate the level of anger I feel at the results of this referrendum. The masses have voted to screw me out of my money for absolutely no benefit to me whatsoever. I can possibly support screwing me for welfare or other handouts. Those are protection money. But this is a total waste of taxpayer money. The schools simply need to spend less. Money is not the panacea to education problems. The true sources of learning are cheap and readily available. Small, rectangular objects called books. I bet this sales tax money just goes straight into teacher's pockets.   I sure wish I could use "the children" as an excuse to rob my fellow citizens of their money. Then I would be a teacher. That's one lesson I learned today.

       A Quick Word About Modern Warfare   In WW2, we fought the Japanese, the Italians, and the Germans. While we did fight their armed forces and killed their people, we did not truly wage war on their countries. We were fighting their cultures. Nazism, Fascism, and the militarism of Japan had led their peoples to wage war and conquer their neighbors. We in America beleived in peace and self-determination. Once the battles with guns and bombs were over, the true battle could begin. We had to bring these people to their senses and educate them that their previous ideals were wrong. It does seem that we have succeeded.   The Soviet Union was also engaged with us in a war of ideas. Again we proved the superiority of our culture and ideals. In the case of the Soviets, they were intelligent enough to never actually engage us on the battlefeild,as the carnage would have been overwhelimg for both sides. When enough time had passed and the lesson had been learned, the people of the Soviet Union threw off thier shackles of Communism and are now striving towards the same goals as we are. Victory came to us by strength and resolve, not by tolerating opposition or caving to demands.  Yet when faced with the same task today, it seems many in America would balk. Islamic fundamentalism is our enemy. We must defeat it in order to maintain our way of life. The benighted peoples under this delusion think that we have somehow stolen their birthright from them. That they have a manifest destiny to decide the shape of the world. That is not the case. Our culture is superior to theirs, and we must prove it to them. We will prove it by force and by love. The kind of love that would pull a man up out of the gutter and give him something to do.   The peoples under the delusion of fundamentalism have nothing better to do than to hate the U.S. and to bemoan thir predicament. We need to bring industry and commerce to these peoples. In many ways the oil resources in some countries have held them back. Why develop industry or agriculture if you can pump wealth out of the ground? Hopefully, we will remake Iraq into a thriving modern state. We must at least ensure that it remains at peace and democratic. If we can show that prosperity and tranquility are attainable in the Middle East, it will provide the inspiration for those in repressed societies that yearn for it.   Just as we showed the Soviets that life could be better without communism, so must we demonstrate to the Arab world the benefits and promise of living as Americans. Iraq is our showroom.

       urlLink Teller's World - Cheapening the Legacy   So, what have we here in the NYT? They are eulogizing the man who conceived the hydrogen bomb. Since it is the NYT, you can bet they made him out to be a villain. But if you use even their own list of his accomplishments, he comes out a visionary. He pioneered the hydrogen bomb, he helped found Livermore Laboratory, and he pushed Ronald Reagan towards missile defense.   The chief complaint the Leftists have against Teller's legacy is that he wanted to make better and more effective weapons. This cuts to the heart of one of the Left's biggest misconceptions: The idea that weapons are inherently evil and that better weapons should never be developed.  They forget or ignore that we are living in a world governed by the use of force, and that America would never attack another country without provocation. The Hydrogen bomb is a weapon so effective that it need never be used. The mere threat of its use was enough to ensure peace between great powers ever since it was developed. The culmination of human endeavor in weapons research seems to be to make weapons unusable. This is only true of course for rational human beings. The Islamic terrorists would not hesitate to risk all to kill innocent people.  I salute Dr. Teller and am glad he lived. His contribution to the world will be derided and criticized by those who do not know how their freedoms are protected. We are all grateful for the hydrogen bomb, but some of us do not realize it.

BUt still, to read about it in such terms is disturbing.

       urlLink Exploiting the Atrocity   A Krugman morning.  The sun is shining and the birds are singing.  Paul just doesn't get it!    ...in the past six weeks President Bush has invoked 9/11 not just to defend Iraq policy and argue for oil drilling in the Arctic, but in response to questions about tax cuts, unemployment, budget deficits and even campaign finance.  End quote.  All of the items he referenced here DO have something to do with 9/11.  We need energyindependence, and ANWR is a start.  We need tax cuts to get the economy moving again.  I don't know what he talking about when he mentions Campaign Finance.  Let's look at the economy.  In the last year of Clinton, we started into a recession.  Then the following events came along in quick order.  9/11 Anthrax Plane crash on Long Island Afghan War Shoe bomber Enron/Arthur Anderson MCI Global Crossing Tycho Embassy Bombings Bali Nightclub Bombing Iraqi War Iraqi Occupation  And I'm sure I'm missing other terrible things like X Men 2 and Gigli.  We should be amazed that the economy isn't melting down.  Instead, the Dow is flirting with 10,000 again.  The deficits as a percentage of GDP are the lowest they have been in decades, despite the almost ludicrous numbers tossed about.  The Treasury coffers are diminished, but as the economy picks up, that problem will go away.  No country has ever taxed itself into prosperity!  Bah.  OKay, I'll leave it alone.  Krugman just gets me going!

      Dan Barda weighed in this morning on the Koran.    Spent a few hours last night reading the Qur'aan and found some more license to kill verses with a catch. I did notice, however, that with in the Qur'aan Allah, kind of reminds me of Jimmy from Seinfeld. The Qur'aan is suppose to be the word of God with no human interference except that it was given to a messenger through the angle Gabriel. The verses I've read all sound like, well a man wrote them and that that messenger is using his own words. ex:"Surely Allah is Forgiving" like duh why wouldn't he be.  Just a thought. Hope you got the Seinfeld reference  22:39, Permission to fight is given to those upon whom war is made because they are oppresses and most surely Allah is well able to assist them   In regards to 2:191 I think you should have included the verse before (190) and the one after (192) And fight in the CAUSE of Allah with those who fight with you, and do not exceed the limits. Surely Allah does not love those who exceed the limits. insert (2:191 here) "Give it to my Baby" (The Offspring; Americana c.1998) But if they desist then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. And fight with them until there is no persecution and religion should be only for Allah but if they desist then there should be no hostility except against the oppressors.  End Email  For those that don't recall, Jimmy was the guy who spoke about himself in the Third Person.  "Jimmy is on fire!"  "Jimmy is thirsty" and so on.    I don't think I get the Offspring parenthetical reference though...  As for context, I concede that I do not have the verses on each side of the items I posted.  It would be interesting to check them, just to be fair.  The reference Don gives here does seem to support the idea that Islam will not tolerate other religions.    And fight with them until there is no persecution and religion should be only for Allah but if they desist then there should be no hostility except against the oppressors.  Religion only for Allah?  What does desist mean?  Submitting to Allah, or just not persecuting Muslims?  I remember seeing something about 'oppression' being defined as any continued worship of any God other than Allah.  I need to look for that, but my seachable Koran link is not working this morning.

While this incident is a tragedy for the Iraqis, friendly fire happens all of the time in war, and we should not view this as a sign of incompetence, as surely the NYT will claim.  It simply isn't a safe place there, and it's going to take more time and lives to get the job done.  I was scanning the networks last night, and I noted that there wasn't a single 9/11 related show on!  Just the usual Sitcoms, and those were even re-runs.  Why couldn't we take at least an hour and have some sort of program on the Attack?  I had to go to the History channel to find anything.  I watched the Towers fall again, and it sharpened my belief that we are doing the right thing overseas.  Somebody should have replayed the entire morning 'as it happened' minute by minute just so we can remember what is was like.  They should do that at least every six months.  When is the last time you saw the planes hit, or the collapse?  I do't want to wallow in grief, but I think it is important to remember what we are doing and why we are doing it.

       urlLink N.Korea Halts Work at Nuclear Facility - U.S. Officials (washingtonpost.com)   The North Korean situation continues to simmer, and while there isn't a lot of public action going on, I believe there is plenty happening behind the scenes.  Kim Jong-Il craves attention, and the less public attention he gets, the more agitated he becomes.  It is best we handle this quietly and with a minimum of public fuss.    I still think this ends in one of two ways.  1.) China yanks his chain and he wises up.  2.) He exercises the only option he has left to avoid looking like a complete fool - he tests a nuke.  At that moment, the next war begins, and I see no other way to assure the safety of that part of the world other than immediate nuclear strikes on North Korean weapons facilities, as well as conventional decapitation strikes on the North Korean leadership.  If anyone wants to kick around my NK thinking, let me know and I'll expand my thoughts.

       urlLink DOWD   Just in case anyone doesn't know, DOWD must be capitalized because she is the most insane columnist for the NYT. Read her column and you will agree she is in a class by herself.  Now, on to the commentary:  "Far from being the swift and gratifying lesson in U.S. dominance that Cheney & Co. predicted, our incursion into Iraq is turning into a spun-out, scary lesson in the dangers of hubris. "  Last time I checked, we won Iraq in record time. It was an awesome and terrible display of power by the U.S. Momar Quadafi got the message. He called up to remind us that he's not a threat to us. The Colonel in charge of Libya has been a good boy ever since Reagan blew up Quadafi's son's tent with him in it.   "I've actually gotten to the point where I hope Dick Cheney is embroiled in a Clancyesque conspiracy to benefit Halliburton. Because if it's not a conspiracy, it's naïveté and ideology. And that means our leaders have used goofball logic and lousy assumptions to trap the country in a cockeyed replay of the Crusades that could drain our treasury and strain our military for generations, without making us any safer from terrorists and maybe putting us more at risk."  The simple fact of the matter is that Haliburton is one of the only contractors that could manage something as massive as rebuilding the infrastructure of Iraq. Who else should do it? DOWD offers no alternative other than to admit defeat and withdraw. Why would a sign of weakness make the threat of terrorism recede? Would it not show that we can be bullied, threatened, and that we lack resolve?  "On 9/11's second anniversary, seven in 10 Americans still believe Saddam had a role in the attacks, even though there is no evidence of it, according to a Washington Post poll. That is because the president has done his level best to conflate 9/11 and Saddam and did so again in his speech on Sunday night.  Iraq never threatened U.S. security. Bush officials cynically attacked a villainous country because they knew it was easier than finding the real 9/11 villain, who had no country. And now they're hoist on their own canard."  I believe Saddam might have been connected with 9/11. He at least celebrated when it happened, and he harbored Al-Queda. And the Bush Doctrine of attacking both terrorists and the sates that harbor them must be followed if we are to have victory. We must make Iraq an example of what happens when you disobey the United States. It was necessary to show our strength, to restore the facade of invincibility that is our true protection.   Just as the Hydrogen Bomb protected us for 50 years against the Soviet menace, so too must the example of Iraq and Afghanistan protect us from the terrorist menace. We can not police the entire world. We must force states to police themselves. And the best and most effective means is by threats. "It could happen to you." the ground war was amazing in Iraq, but the "decapitation" attacks were even more astounding. There is no question that Saddam would have been dead if we knew where he was. We have shown we can kill leaders of countries that offend us at a moments notice. It follows that leaders of states that would be partial to terrorists might reconsider harboring them if doing so might mean the end of their power.  "By pretending Iraq was crawling with Al Qaeda, they've created an Iraq crawling with Al Qaeda.   As Donald Rumsfeld finished up an upbeat talk at the National Press Club here yesterday, brushing off hecklers and calling the global war on terror "well begun," cable began airing fresh Flintstones video of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri encouraging the Iraqi and Islamic fighters to "bury" American troops and send them to their mothers in coffins."  Good! This is exactly what we want. A small shooting gallery of Islamic fanatics. I say let them come. Better over there than over here. And putting American servicemen in danger to protect the rest of us is what the military is for. Once the military casualties equal 3000 in one day, then I might consider the operation a failure.  "The Bush team's logic before the war was infuriatingly Helleresque, and it still is."  I have no idea what this means. COuld someone explain it to me please?  "Mr. Rumsfeld, who was so alarmed about Saddam's W.M.D. before the war, is now so nonchalant that he said he did not even bother to ask David Kay, who runs the C.I.A.'s search for W.M.D. in Iraq, what progress he'd made when meeting with him in Iraq last week.  "I have so many things to do at the Department of Defense," Rummy told The Washington Post."  Look, DOWD. One of three situations exist. One, that WMD's do not exist in Iraq and Saddam destroyed or moved them without bothering to record proof to show us. He could have prevented the invasion by complying with the demands such as providing proof of the destruction of his WMDs. Two, that we have failed to find the WMDs because they are hidden too well. Three, that we have found them and are waiting for the right moment to reveal them.  No what exactly should Donald Rumsfeld be doing right now about the WMDs? Should he be "combing the desert" for them personally? What does it matter really? The threat of Saddam in power in Iraq with WMDs at his disposal is now gone. Mission accomplished. One less state harboring terrorists.  "Asked at the press club why our intelligence analysts did not predict the extent of Iraq's decayed infrastructure, Rummy said dismissively, "They were worrying about more important things." Yeah, like how to get Dick Cheney off their backs."  Those "important things" included Saddam's location, military targets, troop locations, and plans to actually win the war. DOWD loves to make snide little jabs at administration officials. She can't make any solid accusations or prove anything, so she resorts to name calling and innuendo.  "Testifying before the Senate on Tuesday on the $87 billion request, Paul Wolfowitz, the Pentagon official who pushed so hard to own Iraq and control it, said, "We have no desire to own this problem or to control it." There may not be much choice, given Colin Powell's pessimistic warning to Congress yesterday that no allies want to help us pick up the tab for rebuilding a country full of people who revile us."  It is true Wolfowitz campaigned very hard for action in Iraq, but not to control or won it as DOWD suggests. He saw it as what it was - a grave threat to the national security of the U.S. Now that threat is gone. As for the people of Iraq reviling us, I refer you to Todd's post on the first scientific opinion poll done in Iraq. The numbers there show that the people do not hate us, and in fact want us to stay until their country is stable and can stand on its own.

      Maybe I didn't make myself clear.   It would be a rebellious or mentally deficient child that would knowingly poison itself. Honestly, why must the whole class be made to protect this child? Can't the child NOT put penuts in its mouth? What if the child had asthma instead? Should everyone have inhalers on them just in case the child forgot his?   Hell, maybe the teacher could actually watch the kid eat his lunch, to make sure it is free from anything that "may or may not have been processed in a plant that also processes penuts."  Yes, kids are stupid. That's one of their more endearing traits. They ahve the excuse of inexperience. I don't meant the child with the allergies is unworthy of life and deserves to die, just that the child should know better on ingesting penuts. It is the child's responsibility ultimately to refrain from doing itself harm. Electrical sockets and traffic accidents are not in the same leauge as eating penuts. Maybe there would be an uncontrollable urge to eat a penut to find out what he's been missing. Fair enough. But I want to know when exactly the need to punish the group to protect this child ends. When is he able to control his own eating?

      About Mike's comments.  A child isn't capable of protecting itself from hazards.  Left to thier own devices, they will stick fingers in electircal sockets or wander into traffic.  This doesn't make them stupid or unworthy of life.  There are appropriate cases where protection is needed.  They lack the ability to understand the consequences of thier actions.    Adults are a different story.  I don't favor protecting an adult from thier own stupidity in any situation.  As for the value of children over adults, Mike can defend himself.  I invite replies.

      9/11  There has to be a post about 9/11.  On 9/10/01, on the way home from work, my car started acting funny.  It would not kick into high gear, and maintained high RPMs in a lower gear.  So the next morning, I had to drop the car at the dealer to have it checked out.  Diane followed me over while I dropped the car, and then I took her to work and then headed down to Manchester in her car.  It was about an hour drive or so.  On the way, I'm listening to the usual blathering morning show on FM radio.  At one point, the female on the show stopped what she was saying and said "That's weird.  A plane has crashed into the WTC."  Then she goes back to her shtick.  I'm thinking commuter plane, Cessna, private pilot?  Was it foggy?  I thought about the bomber that crashed into the Empire State Building in the fog.    So I started scanning the stations, trying to get some news.  I latch on to a live interview with a witness who is describing that it was a commercial airliner.  I remember thinking something must have really been wrong with that pilot!  I still thought it was accident.  The witness was describing the damage when he suddenly shrieked.  I can't describe it any other way.  He shrieked and began to scream that there was another plane, and a fireball.  The anchor saw it live and was explaining it over the cries of the witness.  About that time I realized I was doing about 20 MPH and had two wheels way over in the dirt.  It didn't seem important.  A few moments later, I was driving like a lunatic to get to work.  The radio was going crazy.  I ran into the building and went right to my desk.  The people I passed had no idea.  One of the drawbacks of working out in the middle of nowhere was the lack of radio signals.  I could not get a single station from inside the plant.  The internet was jammed, and I could only get tiny portions of pages to load, not enough for any news.  I'm sitting in an information vacuum.  Friends start to cycle through my office, making rounds to see if anyone had anything at all.  About that time, a portion of a page came up and said 'Pentagon hit.'  I think that was the moment I felt the proverbial chill.  Later, I saw a report of the State Department in flames, which turned out to be wrong.    I ended up calling my mother, since I didn't know anyone else who would be home in front of a TV.  She filled me in with what she knew, and I recited it word for word to the crowd in my office.  About that time, she said "The tower just fell."  I remember staring at a memo on my desk.  I replied, "You mean a piece of it came off?"  "No, the whole thing just fell."  I stared again for a moment.  "No, some debris fell off of it."  I just couldn't get it through my head.  It wasn't possible.  I told the group, and when I looked up a few seconds later, my office was empty.  I hung up and went back to the internet.  About that time, I heard that someone got a TV going in the lobby.  I got there and watched through a snowy, broken picture as tower two fell.  But I thought I was watching a replay of Tower One!  They cut to another angle and I saw both towers missing.  It then occurred to me what I had seen.  The rest of the day is kind of a blur.  There will be calls to remember today, and to renew our efforts and all that.  I won't repeat them.  But something did occur to me this morning when I heard yet another talking head going on and on about Saddam having nothing to do with 9/11.  I think we are missing the point.  The war on Terror is not vengeance for 9/11.  The mission is not to take out the 9/11 culprits, dust ourselves off and go home.  The mission is to create a world where things like 9/11 do not happen.  That means going after anyone who thought 9/11 was a good idea, or anyone who would entertain such thoughts in the future.  Saddam may not have been involved, but he certainly would be happy to support future actions.  We are in a new type of war, a war of pre-emption.  We aren't going to wait to be hit anymore.  So Saddam's actions really has little to do with the war.  He has demonstrated his nature, and we can't afford to share a planet with him.  So can we get off the misguided notion that this our fight is out of vengeance?

      RE: ANTI-PENUT JIHAD  I was referring mainly to the mentality of the anti-penut people. They are being hysterical, and honestly Mark is being hysterical too. Why would your baby have contact with penuts anyway? Can't you test for this allergy?   The pharase "The insane crusade against penuts continues!" was an allusion to the mentality of those enforcing the confiscation of children's lunches at the public scrool. They decided that the idiot children and idiot parents couldn't be trusted with penuts because they might somehow harm the poor, defenseless kid with allergies.   Since Mark seemed to take offense to my harsh outlook on this issue, I must continue to bait him with this statement:   If the kid is stupid enough to eat penuts even though he knows it could kill him, then he deserves whatever happens to him, including death. Better he takes himself out now while he's not very important.   This phrase was nominated for greater explanation: "Now the forefront of this heroic struggle to protect the weak and stupid from themselves has a new front: Kindergarten." By this is meant that the socialist agenda of subordinating individual rights and responsibilities for those of the group continues to be shoved down children's throats. It might not seem that way at fist glance, considering it was the group's rights and priviledges that were impacted in this case. But in the end, every individual in the group lost his rights so as to protect someone from something they needed no one's help to be protected from.   The child was judged by the teachers and its parent to be too weak and stupid to protect itself. I am merely reporting on that judgment. I suppose the child really is stupid and weak if it cannot keep penuts out of its mouth. Why not just send a note home with all the other kids telling their parents to instruct their children not to share penuts with the allergic child?   Todd is absolutely right that my fight is with the "nanny mentality." I resent the idea that individual responsibility is not sufficient to protect and guide my life. I do not need some group to dictate what is best for me. The only groups I belong to I do so voluntarily. The group "people with penuts allergies" is just one more group of victims to the Leftists that needs to be protected. And the only reason these retarded warning labels like "may or may not have been processed in a plant that also processes penuts" exist is to protect against lawsuits. If those with penut allergies didn't try to capitalize on thier own problem and make money off of food producers, this warning label would not exist.   My final point: Do not let "the children" ever be a reason to abandon reason for emotion. In the final analysis, children are NOT as important as adults. Case in point: What husband would choose to sacrifice his wife to save an unborn child? This is of course assuming the husband loves his wife.   Another hypothetical situation. You have two buttons. One will kill a child, the other will kill an adult. You must push a button. you know nothing about the two people, and you will never see them. Which to push? Only emotion and instict would have you choose the child. Weighing their worth makes the adult obviously worth saving over the child.  Just a little taste of thought and sunshine to start the day off right.

      Ah crap!  I had a bunch of nice links for the peanut rant below and something happened to them!  I'll try to reconstruct later.  The gist of one of the articles was 20-40% of kids end up outgrowing the allergy within a year or two.  The other links were tables and charts or death rates.  Sorry....

      My brother Mark takes issue with Mike's anti-anti-peanut rant.  I've never understood the sudden rise in peanut allergies.  We've had peanuts for centuries, and suddenly they seem to be poison in microgram quantities.  I'm not saying the allergies don't exist, far from it.  I just don't understand WHY they are so common now.   Mark: I would like to comment about Mike's response about the raging "Socialism" at work regarding the Peanut Ban at that school in CA.  I don't think Mike is up to speed on the seriousness of the recent rise in peanut allergies.  Much like autism, for reasons unknown peanut allergies are rising astronomically in children now.  Jack's (my one year old) doctor forbade us to give him ANYTHING that has come into contact with peanut or peanut oil until after his first birthday.  When his grandmother accidentally gave him a peanut butter sandwich it induced a comment from the nurse along the lines of watch him close, the first sign of possible breathing problems call 911.  Pretty intense.  My wife's close friend just had a cousin literally DIE in a thai restaurant because he didn't know and forgot to ask if Pad Thai had peanuts.     These are 5 year old kids, they don't have a true understanding of danger.  They hang upside down from very high monkeybars for god sakes (at least, where those have not been banned).  It would be easy for a kid with life threatening allergies to come into contact or ingest something unknowingly dangerous and innocuous enough not to be obvious (like swallowing a piece of glass).  At it's heart this is a discussion of should a large group conform for the interests of a single person.  Usually I say no.  But the hardship of forgoing peanut products does not out-weigh depriving the child of a public education.  This is not a matter of convenience, he doesn't just get a rash.  Anyway, with the explosive rise of peanut allergies, you are going to see this thing happen all over the place.     I will agree that the method of enforcing the ban was atrocious.  There should have been public debate, informative PTA sessions and a thorough explanation and review of the new procedures and policies.  That made the whole affair seem more draconian and hard core socialist.   Explain to me what you meant by the phrase: The insane crusade against penuts continues! Do you think there is not a rise in peanut allergies, or do you think the severity of peanut allergies are over exaggerated?   Also, this phrase: Now the forefront of this heroic struggle to protect the weak and stupid from themselves has a new front: Kindergarten Are you implying that people with life threatening allergies are weak?  Or those that have life threatening allergies and are too young or unable to control all aspects of their environment that contains the allergic material are stupid?  I think you may have been over-exaggerating and kidding a bit, I just wanted to make sure.   End email.   My personal view leans more toward education rather than banning.  If it is as serious as it seems, we should be screening children for the allergy, and treat it as seriously as asthma.  This children should be identified and the school authorities made aware of the condition and the emergency action.  If a child has asthma, we don't ban play time outside.  Same for peanuts.  I think the point of Mike's comments strike more to the root of the 'nanny' mentality that exists in today's world.  We strive to make it super safe, when some of this safety falls to individual responsibility.  Like the Walt Williams column I linked to yesterday.  If we begin to trade individual responsibility for the common good, where does it stop?  This particular issue is difficult because it involves children.  Whenever children are involved, we tend to start throwing out theoretical arguments about liberty for the assurance of safety.  I understand the tendency, but I can't agree with it.  Peanuts are indeed a small thing.  No one will suffer because they didn't have their peanut butter at lunch.  BUt the premise that the final solution is a restriction on the group rather than proactive action by the affected person, suggests an erosion of our collective responsibility to ourselves.  Now we will entertain all sorts of comments about the rights of smokers, an the documented effects of second hand smoke et al.  If you can document a health risk, then can you ban an action such as smoking?  Whose rights trump the other?  Does the smoker have the right to smoke in public?  You could say that as a non-smoker, I have the right to occupy a public place without the health risk, but is that true?  Do I have such a right?  Or is it my duty to remove myself from hazardous areas?  I favor a voluntary ban on smoking in public places such as malls and restaurants.  It is up to the owner to decide.  However in 'captive' environments such as air travel where the non-smoker has no opportunity to remove himself, I think you have to enforce a ban.  It is a messy question, full of twists and turns.  I think it illustrates philosophical differences quite nicely.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?  Or is individual freedom sacred at the expense of the group?  Anyway, sorry to get sidetracked.  I just want to know how many people are on a peanut crusade just for the crusade, and how many are really in physical danger.  Like Mark pointed out, the peanut issue was intense for him when medical professionals start talking about his son dying.  But in the end, I don't think there was a reaction (unless I missed it somewhere Mark?).  I wonder how many 'weak' parents don't react sensibly like Mark, and decide to go on a peanut jihad when it might not be warranted?  How many parents have forbidden all peanut contact when thier kid might be just fine?  Some articles:    urlLink ">   urlLink    The second column reveals that out of 1.5 million peanut allergy sufferers, 100 die per year.  In 1998, 5400 people died of asthma out of a diagnosed population of 10.6 million.  That is a death rate of 1 out of every 1,962.  For peanuts, the death rate is 1 out of 15,000.   urlLink    Also interesting: 20 kids a year die on the playground.   urlLink

As the article suggests, we are subjected to a constant anecdotal barrage of how Iraq is turning into a -- say it with me - 'quagmire' from whence we shall not escape.  There are many positive aspects of our relationship with the average Iraqi, and far more good is going on there than bad.  It is interesting to note that the Shiites, whom make up a majority in Iran, seem to be more favorable to the US.  I think this portends some bad times for the Tehran Mullahs in the future.

The insane crusade against penuts continues! Now the forefront of this heroic struggle to protect the weak and stupid from themselves has a new front: Kindergarten! I have to wonder if the scrool shares the lunches of the children equally, like they no doubt do with scrool supplies. How else would the kid be eating the penuts? Are kids going to assault him and force him to eat?  A tiny except in case you don't want to read this alarmingly lengthy article:  "My child's allergies are life-threatening," she said. "If he contacts peanut oil, it could threaten his life. This is a lot different than dust mites."   She said with the measures taken by the school, her son faces no threat. "This is nothing new.

       urlLink Casting A Cold Eye on Arctic Oil   This is a NYT editorial by one Nicholas Kristof. He went on a trip to the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to see first-hand what exactly would be "spoiled" by drilling for oil. He plays at being objective and tries to really consider the issue, but in the end he's just another environmentalist whacko. I will cite excerpts from his artice below, and my responses:  "Arctic oil can be chimerical, and it would be tragic to sacrifice this wilderness for a series of dry wells."  If the wells turn out to be unprofitable, won't the pullout by the oil industry return the area to a state of pristine beauty? Or will the mere presence of some buildings or some scaffolds or something ruin it for all time? I bet the animals would be glad to have some shelter made for them.   "It's also only fair to give special weight to the views of the only people who live in the coastal plain: the Inupiat Eskimos, who overwhelmingly favor drilling (they are poor now, and oil could make them millionaires). One of the Eskimos, Bert Akootchook, angrily told me that if environmentalists were so anxious about the Arctic, they should come here and clean up the petroleum that naturally seeps to the surface of the tundra."  "Drilling supporters also grossly understate the impact of drilling when they speak of only a 2,000-acre "footprint" in the Arctic. The reality is that oil would mean roads, lodgings, pipelines, security fences, guard stations and airstrips â€” and my children would never be able to experience the Arctic as I have. "  This illustrates the classic elitism of the whacko environmentalists. They want the emotional comfort of protecting something. The people who live with the useless crap that is protected are always in favor of exploiting it. What good is any resource until it is used? Kristof wants to keep this area a wasteland so his progeny can frolick there. MEanwhile, the people who live their and have some claim to the land live in poverty. They don't have a cushy NYC apartment to fly home to. Yet he wants to keep them poor just to soothe his ego. Is some tundra more important than improving people's lives? It is to Kristof.  What benefit is there to not drilling? It would maintain the pristine beauty of a marshy tundra so the elite can go and view it for a week.   Now, what are the benefits to bringing oil out of the ground? Jobs, wealth, and reduced dependance on hostile states for oil. All of this would magically appear out of the ground! What an awesome miracle! Leftisits would have us eschew such an enterprise so as to keep us dependant and poorer than we could be.  I suppose only third-world toilets like Saudi Arabia and Traq are fit to benefit from the wealth uner the ground. America doesn't want to tap into its own reserves. Those are for future generations and peoples to exploit. What right do those future generations have to deprive us of resources? Some one will pump this oil. It will be utilized. The benefits of doing it now are tremendous. There is no drawback. No one can make any rational argument against drilling. No one loses anything. A great many people benefit. We all would benefit.   Now that I have done with reason, I will return us to Kristof and his inane blatherings:  "True, we need to get our oil from somewhere, and Americans are dying now in Iraq because of our dependence on foreign oil. So I would endorse drilling in the Arctic refuge if it were part of a mega-environmental package that also addressed global warming, an environmental challenge where we have even more at stake than in the Arctic."  This is the tired "war for oil" message we've been hearing for a year. Apparently Kristof thinks that drilling is some sort of sacrifice that could be leveraged to force the US to pour money down the rathole of Global Warming. That is a subject for another post, but I will state here the absolute truth of Global Warming. There is no conclusive or even highly suggestive scientific data that GLobal Warming exists. It is a thinly veiled attempt to shackle the USA with restrictions on our way of life. If Global Warming did exist, who can say if it would not be beneficial?  "Yet President Bush's push to open the Arctic refuge is not part of such a bold and thoughtful package to break the stalemate on the environment. Rather it is simply a lunge for oil. Without trying to conserve oil, Mr. Bush would gobble up a national treasure, the birthright of our descendants, as a first resort."  Here I must lay out for you the thesis about resources from the Leftists: There is a finite supply of all resources, be they money, oil, or jobs. To increase one group's share is to reduce that of all other groups. Conservation of resources and proper management is the only way to ensure adequate supply for everyone.  This thesis is completely flawed. The idea that there is a finite supply of anything is bogus. Take oil for example. True, there is little new oil being created deep whithin the earth. But it is not true that no new sources are being discovered. The estimates of oil reserves are continually being revised, and for the better.   As an example of a pletiful resource being tightly regulated and conserved, consider diamonds. De Beers controlls the world's diamond supply. They decide how many diamonds to mine and sell. There is no shortage of diamonds. They are in fact extremely common. But this tight control by a single supplier has led to diamonds being expensive. If the market was suddenly given an ifusion of cheaper diamonds De Beers would have to expend great sums of money to buy up all the excess supply, or their monopoly would be finished. This has happened several times before, and De Beers has nearly gone broke because of it.   The moral of this story is that conservation does nothing but raise prices. Reducing consumption would essentially reduce supply, because there would be less incentive to pump oil out of the ground. Reduced demand would then lead to higher prices. The solution to any case of high demand is to increase supply. Drilling in Alaska would have the effect of reducing prices for oil pumped out of Saudi Arabia. Only the rulers of OPEC nations would benefit from our failure to exploit oil reserves in Alaska.   Kristof employs a weak and flimsy emotional argument as his conclusion. Rational people cannot listen to such an appeal with anything but pity and scorn.   "The argument that I find most compelling is that this primordial wilderness, a part of our national inheritance that is roughly the same as it was a thousand years ago, would be irretrievably lost if we drilled. The Bush administration's proposal to drill is therefore not just bad policy but also shameful, for it would casually rob our descendants forever of the chance to savor this magical coastal plain â€” and to be slapped in the butt by a frisky polar bear."  You would think the inhabitants of this "magical coastal plain" might be in the best position to tell us if it should be preserved or exploited. But apparently Kristof and those like him are the true inhabitants of the land. They are able to percieve its true beauty. Beauty that robs the current inhabitants of the chance to profit from something useless under their feet. The arrogance is astounding, and Kristof insults the Eskimos by saying they are not smart enough to preserve the beauty around them.

      Don sent an email his morning about his research into Islam.  I’ll past it here and then offer some of my own thoughts.  Don:  Ok Todd did some research on "God's Religion". What is Gods religion? Islam, to submit unconditionally to Allah. Judaism named after some desert dwelling folk, Hinduism named after the Hindus people of India, Confucianism not really a religion but named after a traveling Chinaman (getting to my point), Zoroastrianism, some obscure religion in Persia named after another 30 year old hippy, and Christianity, named for Jesus Christ. What the Muslims believe is that Islam came from God not Muhammad. Otherwise it would be call Muhammadism. I think this is important because it stresses the divinity of the message. Which is live, like I tell ya and you will live in paradise, were you can have your 70 some virgins(who would want a virgin anyway). Islam is God's final call to worship him the way he wants to be worshiped kind of pig headed of Him I think.  As far as it Islam being a religion of peace and love it is if you are male and a Muslim. To them dressing their women in Charlie Brown ghost costumes is their way of warding off temptation. I can see their point, maybe. The Bible says in order to resist temptation we must stay away from it.  Islam again "is the worship of Allah ALONE and the avoidance of worship directed to any person, place or thing other than Allah" I wonder why they hold sacred Jerusalem if they believe in the avoidance of worship directed to any place.  Jihad to strive/make effort in the way of Allah. Holy war comes from the west. " So obey not the disbelievers, but make a great jihad(effort) against them (by preaching) with it(the Qur'aan)(Surah al Furqan 25:52)  "He who kills himself with anything Allah will torment him with that in the fire of hell" Words of the Prophet. However, in order to reach paradise a Muslim must be 51% righteous with no way to atone for ones sins, except to become a martyr, hmm curious. But then again all religions are a little nuts. They are permitted to fight for their religion. there are three types of jihad, inner (self), words, and the sword. I would like to think my God doesn't carry a sword or any WMD.  Anyway I am rambling I guess it took God 3 times to deliver His message.  isn't that like making 2 previous mistakes.  The point: all religions preach peace and love show me one that doesn't. The research I'm doing proves that in regards to Islam, I’ll try to site some next time. And because Muslims believe Islam is the final message from God they are pretty hardcore about it. Your right there are no Islamic amusement parks, no street side Qur'aan preaching holier-then-thous. But good news does not make good news. One more thing, terrorism in the Muslim world is a minority just like pedophilia is to Catholicism.  End of email.  Since the events of 9/11, I have spent some time myself looking at Islam.  While me ‘research’ has not been exhaustive, I have learned a lot about the ‘Religion of Peace’.  But before I start, I should qualify what I say so as to not be misunderstood.  I do not believe in organized religion in any fashion.  While I am still open to the idea of a God in some form, I don’t believe that the various organized faiths have any legitimate claim as to being the One.  Therefore, any perceived Islamic bashing should not be seen as an attempt to promote Christianity over Islam.  The Christians have their own problems. The organized faiths are generally problematic to me for many reasons.  One of the primary problems in modern Christianity is their willingness to mold and adapt themselves to today’s world.  From ‘cafeteria’ Catholicism who pick and choose which elements of their faith to hold sacred, and which to ignore such as abortion, to the ordainment of Gay priests and female priests, these faiths are evolving.  However, if they profess to follow the word of God, then how can they justify changing God’s Will over time?  A central tenant to all faiths is the perfection and timelessness of God, and to amend his rules seems counter to that concept.    Unless you wish to concede that many of the Church rules are indeed imperfect rules of Man, and therefore subject to change.  If that is the case, where does God’s Will and Man’s Rules part ways?  What is truly delivered by God, and therefore unchangeable?  The Ten Commandments come to mind, but that makes an awfully thin Bible if the rest of it is just history up until the New Testament.  In reality, the Muslim fanatic is probably the most sincere and consistent worshiper.  They have the Shari’a, the Law of God, and they believe that no other laws can be made, even the laws of Man.  Therefore, things like the Constitution and our Justice System are heretical.  While it limits their perspective, and mires them in the 12th century, it is indeed consistent with their faith.    So, now that my perspective on religion is on the table, let’s look at Islam.  Islam is and always has been a warrior faith.  Muhammad was a conqueror, and his band of followers were on the run most of their lives.  I think that shades the Koran and the entire background of the faith.  It provides some perspective on what is written.  While Don is right when he says Islam preaches love and peace, it must not be overlooked that love and peace are reserved for the Believers.  One of the worst sins of Islam is violence of harm on one Muslim from another.  However, if you are not a Muslim, you are essentially not a human being in their eyes, and many of the prohibitions in the Koran do not apply to non-Muslims.  [2.90] Evil is that for which they have sold their souls-- that they should deny what Allah has revealed, out of envy that Allah should send down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath, and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers.  [2.191] And kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence they drove you out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it, but if they do fight you, then slay them; such is the recompense of the unbelievers.  [3.28] Let not the believers take the unbelievers for friends rather than believers; and whoever does this, he shall have nothing of (the guardianship of) Allah, but you should guard yourselves against them, guarding carefully; and Allah makes you cautious of (retribution from) Himself; and to Allah is the eventual coming.  [4.18] And repentance is not for those who go on doing evil deeds, until when death comes to one of them, he says: Surely now I repent; nor (for) those who die while they are unbelievers. These are they for whom We have prepared a painful chastisement.  [4.101] And when you journey in the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten the prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve will cause you distress, surely the unbelievers are your open enemy.  [4.144] O you who believe! do not take the unbelievers for friends rather than the believers; do you desire that you should give to Allah a manifest proof against yourselves?  [5.57] O you who believe! do not take for guardians those who take your religion for a mockery and a joke, from among those who were given the Book before you and the unbelievers; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah if you are believers.  (I guess it was worth repeating!)  [7.37] Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or rejects His communications? (As for) those, their portion of the Book shall reach them, until when Our messengers come to them causing them to die, they shall say: Where is that which you used to call upon besides Allah? They would say: They are gone away from us; and they shall bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers  [9.55] Let not then their property and their children excite your admiration; Allah only wishes to chastise them with these in this world's life and (that) their souls may depart while they are unbelievers.  [9.123] O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness; and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil).  [18.100] And We will bring forth hell, exposed to view, on that day before the unbelievers.  [25.52] So do not follow the unbelievers, and strive against them a mighty striving with it.  [30.45] That He may reward those who believe and do good out of His grace; surely He does not love the unbelievers.  [39.71] And those who disbelieve shall be driven to hell in companies; until, when they come to it, its doors shall be opened, and the keepers of it shall say to them: Did not there come to you apostles from among you reciting to you the communications of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours? They shall say: Yea! But the sentence of punishment was due against the unbelievers.  [60.13] O you who believe! do not make friends with a people with whom Allah is wroth; indeed they despair of the hereafter as the unbelievers despair of those in tombs.  [74.10] For the unbelievers, anything but easy.  [80.42] These are they who are unbelievers, the wicked.  Whew!  And that was just a sample.    Now, the argument can still be made that these passages are no more harmful than plenty of outlandish statements found in the Bible or Torah, but I find it a stretch.  Islam is a fantastic religion when it comes to the self-promoting drive to spread itself.  By fire, sickle and sword, to borrow a phrase.  For me, the question still remains: where are the peaceful Muslims who have nothing but love for all men, regardless of faith?  Don is right, the Muslims take this Third Faith as the final chance to get it right, and they are hardcore about it.   I see programs on CNN about Indonesia, and the depth of the Islamic hatred for the West.  I see educated people, common people, going to work in a wealthy country, with pictures of Bin Laden in their wallets.  It doesn’t take ‘nuance’ to see the events of 9/11 as evil.  The educated Muslims of somewhat westernized states cannot claim ignorance or poverty as an excuse to endorse the murder of Israelis or the death of Cantor Fitzgerald workers on the 104th floor.   What is the answer?  Christianity had the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, extending religious tolerance to every major flavor of Christianity, bringing to a close some of the most barbaric years of western history.  It was a moment where major faiths decided that conversion by the sword no longer made sense, and we should live and let live.  Still, atrocity occurs all the time in the name of faith, but Islam still has a long way to go.  What is the answer?  What should we do?  How will it end?  And are we willing to do what must be done?  Religious tolerance is so much a part of our culture; it has become an almost physical force in our lives.  To condemn or chastise another faith runs counter to what we believe in.  That makes the task at hand difficult.  The problem: Islam.  The answer: Islam.  No one else can fix this.  I look forward to other views.

      An email from my brother, Mark.  It seems he is a little angry about the Dicky Roberts Slip n' Slide issue.   Slip 'N Slide sues Dicky Roberts producers.  The brunt of the argument is that the depiction of the incorrect way to "Slip 'N Slide" will endorse copycats incidents which will lead to lawsuits against Wham-O.  This is because some drunk idiot paralyzed himself on one in Wisconsin and got 12 odd million bucks.  So, it's gotten to the point where a ridiculous lawsuit is needed to show due diligence to protect against POTENTIAL ridiculous law suits.  OUTSTANDING!  I think civil suits should all be bench trials.  There is too much human emotion.  You have 12 average Joe's slugging it through life with 250 lottery tickets in their collective wallets getting a "feel good" rush by playing Santa Claus and Savior to some dumb schlep who spills coffee on their junk.  It's almost a victimless crime, what faceless corporation couldn't spare 12 mil to the kid who didn't read the directions on the glue gun?  Or is it that every juror sitting there thinks in the back of their mind, gee, maybe someday it will be me, and I'll be lucky enough to lose an eye to a champagne cork?  Then again, maybe we shouldn't complain too much, the "Get Rich Quick" lust has been engraved in the American Pysche since it's inherent implication upon the founding of our country.  I know one thing, screw the 9-5, I'm getting a six pack and looking for someone dumb enough to leave the cover off of the pool.

       urlLink Other People's Sacrifice   It is always a glorious morning when Paul Krugman writes a column.  It brightens my day.  Krugman: Is he prepared to roll back some of those tax cuts, now that the costs of war loom so large? Is he even willing to stop urging Congress to make the 2001 tax cut permanent? Of course not.  Me:  Oh yeah, let's RAISE taxes right when the economy is starting to come back.  That should kill off whatever recovery we are experiencing.  Everytime he has an opportunity, Krugman goes after those tax cuts.  Krugman: Yet in the speech on Sunday he was still up to his usual tricks. Once again, he made a rhetorical link between the Iraq war and 9/11. This argument by innuendo reminds us why 69 percent of the public believes that Saddam was involved in 9/11, despite a complete absence of evidence. (There is, on the other hand, strong evidence of a Saudi link — but the administration's handling of that evidence borders on a cover-up.) And rather than acknowledge that the search for W.M.D. has come up empty, he declared that Saddam "possessed and used weapons of mass destruction" — 1991, 2003, what's the difference?  Me:  I don't think any reasonable person can maintain the argument that Saddam just loved the US and would never help anyone who wished us ill.  Perhaps there is no evidence of direct 9/11 involvement, but do you really think Saddam wouldn't aid and shelter terror groups?  As for the Saudis, yes, they are NOT our friends.  But we have to choose that fight at the proper moment.  We push the wrong way, and the oil fields go fundamentalist in a heartbeat.  Something like 45% of ther Saudi population is under 30, and they are poor and angry.  The House of Saud is not a friendly group of monarchs, but they stand between us and disaster.  In good time, they have to go, but we aren't ready to deal with that.  If the oil fields are lost to Islam, will the left be ready to invade?  I doubt it.  Our posture with the Saudis is uncomfortable, but so long as we refuse to exploit and develop our own natural resources, where are we going to get the energy to replace the flow from the Gulf?  We HAVE to protect the Saudi 'friendship', at least until we are in a position to force change.  This is what Iraq is all about.  We are trying to change the face of the Middle East.  A democratic, free, oil-producing Iraq sends ripples that will be felt in Damascas, Riyadh, and Tehran.  It is the most sensible long term effort we can make.  Otherwise, we will have to invade each of these nations and go through the Iraq experience multiple times.  As far as Krugman's last sentence above, he seems remarkably blase about Saddam's use of chemical weapons against Iran and the Kurds.  I guess atrocities only count if they are recent.

       urlLink Frankenfood: It's Not Easy to Live GMO-Free, by Chaelan MacTavish - Democratic Underground   Oh, man! This is going to be fun! Commence preperatins for rumbling!  "(W)e were assured by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (a former CEO of Monsanto) that this posed no risk whatsoever to human consumption.   If there is no risk, why are so many countries around the world banning GMOs from being allowed over their borders?"  The reason, which they cannot admit to, is that these foods are patented. Yes, some heartless corporation owns the particular strain of soybeans in this case. They seek to make a profit from this patented invention. Foreign countries are dirt-poor, and do not want to pay for the rights to grow this crop, so they cite some taboo against it as their reason for boycotting it.   "Two years ago they(the US Congress) sent millions of dollars worth of corn to Zimbabwe. The ship was stopped at the docks, and a port official asked for documents that would certify the cargo as being genetically unmodified. The ship's captain had no such documents, and did not know where the corn originally came from, or from what seed stock it was grown. The Zimbabwe government courteously thanked the captain for his time, told him to go home, and to take his corn with him. A poor starving country turned down tons of free corn because - well, they didn't know what it would do. "  They couldn't let it in because then their populace would realize that there was no danger to eating the corn. The leaders of Zimbabwe are using this irrational fear of science to maintain power. If the populace was educated so that they would discard their taboo, the evil foreigners would get rich by delivering superior crops to the impoverished farmers of Zimbabwe.  "In restaurants in the European Union, one may notice while scanning the menu that an occasional small "gm" note will be stuck to the side of certain dishes. This is because it is required by law to label any dishes or foods that may contain genetically modified ingredients. "  I remind you of my previous rant against the "may or may not have been processed in a plant that also processes peanuts." This is similar. I wonder how much this silly taboo is costing the people of Europe? Not that I have any sympathy for them.   " In Oregon last year, a public referendum to label GMOs went on the ballot; every newspaper and commercial break extolled the bill as unfair to America's farmers, with personal quotes from rural Oregonians who feared being put out of business should this bill pass. The bill failed, and the huge Agribusiness giants in the Midwest (that are the primary growers of GM crops) were safe from having us know who grew their food. "  I would have to say that the argument of the farmers and the "evil" corporations was the more persuasive to the ovters of Oregon, which is not a part of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy. It was a Blue state last election, remember. Also, what is this "knowing who grew their food"? That was just sloppy writing.  "The booming organic industry, estimated to top $15 billion dollars this year worldwide, is addressing the needs of a large segment of consumers who have begun to question what they are eating. Popular health-food chains, such as Whole Foods, Nature's, and Wild Oats, now have customers ranging from the barefoot hippie, to the soccer mom, to the retired civil servant. Many people are opting to put tastier, healthier organic food on their table - and a rebellious few have taken the extra step to eliminating GMOs from their diet altogether. "  See the power of capitalism! You can persist in your folly and someone will make a product that will cater to your delusion! A case of the unseen manifesting its power in the real world. The "unseen" in this case being the dangers of genetically improved food. And who can truly say that organic food is tastier than non-organic?   "Sysco makes its money because it can deliver food to restaurants cheaper than a restaurant could buy it for anywhere else. Agribusiness makes money because they are so huge and have so much supply that they can sell for extremely cheap prices to edge out competition. Restaurants make money because they can buy cheap food from Sysco. "  I am impressed! He grasps the concept of enonomies of scale. The push to genetic modification is just another facet of this thing I like to call Progress. We are doing the same as has been done for thousands of years. We are breeding things with eachother to produce desirable traits. And in the end, who cares what components are used to make a food, a dog, or anything else as long as the outcome is desirable?  "omeone eating GMO-free usually begins by taking things out of their diet in stages; first fast food, then packaged foods with GMOs, then non-organic meat, then beer and wine, and lastly, eating out. This last step is usually the hardest, and shows the greatest commitment for one's own body, by being unable to go out for a bite with friends, or stopping to pick up dinner on the way home from work, to make food that you know is safe in your own kitchen."  This is funny. This is similar to my journey into the low-carb lifestyle, except I don't care where my food comes from. In fact, I would be more disposed to buy genetically modified food, since it won't need to ahve so many pesticides used on it or cost nearly as much. Any claim that genetically-modified food is unsafe is totally unfounded in facts.  "It is definitely cheaper to get all your food from a grocery chain like Albertsons, but the higher prices of organic food is what food really costs. To grow an ear of corn, get it to the farmers market, and to your plate, it costs twice as much as what a corporate chain would charge to get it from a subsidized Agribusiness farm onto their shelves. But that food isn't really food - its profit margins. "  Remember when I said he gets economies of scale? Forget I said it. The evil corporation rears its head again! I am sure his real problem with farm subsidies is that his precious hippies don't get any. Or not enough, since I am nearly certain they get subsidies.  "In capitalism, capital is what counts. If you would like to see more organic foods in your community, vote with your dollars, and start buying all organic. The businesses will follow, and eating GMO-free will soon be as simple as looking on the label. "  I say this is the right way to go about it. But I suspect that these people won't jsut vote with their greenbacks, but will use their shrill voices to cry for some sort of anti-capitalist legislation to force food producers to conform to their ideas. And that will just drive the prices up across the board.

       urlLink Europeans said eating like Americans   See how superior the American way of life is? Even the snotty EUniks are eating our crappy fast food!   I have to bring up the Atkins lifestyle as the One True Path to normal weight. Don't be fooled by any imitators, like the South Beach diet. This lifestyle shift is hard at first, but it is neither dangerous or expensive. But it is not for everyone, as it does take a force of will that too few people are capable of.   When you see yourself in the mirror and realize that you didn't always look this way, that you want to look better, you must decide THEN to do something about it. One day I woke up, looked in the mirror, and decided that I was fat. I knew it was because of what I put in my mouth. So I changed. Months later I am 25lbs lighter and feeling better than I ever have before. Sure, I miss all the sugar and breads I used to eat. But I know better than to go down that path again. All it took was willpower. Why aren't you thin? Because you are weak. It's that simple. Make a decision today to stop your destructive behavior and start living as your body was meant to.  Email me if you have any concerns, or need a pep talk. I really do want everyone to eat this way. It works, and that's all that matters in the end.

       urlLink Bush's "Good News" Conference, by Sheila Samples - Democratic Underground : This is here just for the entertainment value.  No need to refute.  Interesting that the Left take the following position on Israel.  "When asked about his biased policies toward Israel, Bush launched into his scripted, inane, and totally incomprehensible spiel about how Palestine must first stop the terrorism so they can 'live side by side with Israel.' "  And this -   Move on. Nothing to discuss here. Given Bush's doctrine on WMD and on what constitutes a terrorist regime, why would he discuss the only nuclear power in the Middle East... the only country in the region that refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty... the only country that defiantly refuses to allow inspection of its nuclear facilities... the only country that gives the finger to United Nations resolutions... the only country that occupies land belonging to its neighbors, and the only country that continues to attack and destroy its neighbors without fear of retribution every single day?   Me: THe only country that gives the finger to the UN?  What about Iraq, or even Iran for that matter?  Attack and destroy neighbors without fear of retribution?  Would this guy like to eat at an Israeli Cafe??  Remarkable how such virulent hatred is reserved for Bush, Israel and conservatives, while the murderers get a free pass.

       urlLink Star Telegram | 10/30/2003 | Reality vs. public relations :   This column by Ivins wasn't really notable, until I got to the following passage.  She's railing about the PR effort of the Bush White House to counter the negative propoganda of the mainstream media.  She said -   "George Nethercutt, a Republican congressman from Washington state, spent four days in Iraq and told an audience at home: 'The story of what we've done in Iraq is remarkable. It is a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day.'"  Sounds terrible, doesn't it?  Heartless, cruel republican, dismissing the lives of soldiers so casually....  Unfortunately, Nethercutt had been DOWDified by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  If you aren't aware, DOWDification is what Maureen DOWD did to President Bush, when she strung together two different parts of a sentence, dropping out some crucial words to make it sound like Bush said something he didn't.  She got away with it to, since the NYT reequired no correction even in the face of audio recordings of what Bush said.  Back to Nethercutt.  Here is what he said, as confirmed by an audio recording of his statement.    "It's a bigger and better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day, which, which, heaven forbid, is awful."   Make a difference?  I took this from Best of the Web on Wednesday.  If you are interested in the whole sorry affair, I'll paste it in here.   On Oct. 15, we approvingly  noted  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110004168#nethercutt  a comment from Rep. George Nethercutt, a Washington state Republican who is challenging Sen. Patty Murray in next year's election. "The story of what we've done in the postwar period is remarkable," the Seattle Post-Intelligencer quoted Nethercutt, who had just returned from Iraq, as saying. "It is a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day."    That day we received an e-mail from Mary Lane of the Nethercutt Senate campaign:    *** QUOTE ***    The Seattle P-I actually cut off the second part of Nethercutt's quote about losing soldiers in Iraq. Here is the full sentence (I have it on tape): "It's a bigger and better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day, which, which, heaven forbid, is awful."     As you know, the P-I put a period after "day." I contacted both the reporter and the editor and attempted to get the P-I to print a clarification, but to no avail.    *** END QUOTE ***   This struck us as a fairly minor complaint. The abridgment of Nethercutt's quote changed only its emphasis, not its meaning; and surely it goes without saying that the deaths of American servicemen are awful.    But in light of the way the Post-Intelligencer has been savaging Nethercutt since then, we have to conclude Lane had a point. First came an  Oct. 16 editorial  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/144006_iraqspined.html  denouncing "an effort to put a more positive spin on Americans' perception of the war in Iraq":    *** QUOTE ***    Then there was U.S. Rep. George Nethercutt's ham-handed attempt to redirect news coverage and public attention to the war's positive side. "It's a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day," the would-be senator gaffed at a gathering Monday.    The family of Pfc. Kerry Scott of Concrete, who buried their young hero Tuesday, likely would not share Nethercutt's news judgment.    *** END QUOTE ***   Anyway, yesterday Nethercutt bought an ad in the Post-Intelligencer and the Seattle Times in which he accused the former paper of misquoting him, and this prompted the P-I to publish its first  news story  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/145724_nethercutt28.html  acknowledging the dispute. It quoted managing editor David McCumber standing by the story: "Congressman Nethercutt was quoted accurately and within context by the P-I, and that's sort of the beginning and the end of it, as far as I'm concerned."    But it wasn't the end of it as far as the paper was concerned. Today the paper ran a  petulant editorial  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/145809_nethercutted.html  denouncing Nethercutt again:    *** QUOTE ***    Consider, again, the quote in question--fleshed out a bit more.     "The story of what we have done in the postwar period . . . is remarkable," Nethercutt said, because the coalition has been rebuilding power plants, police stations, schools and other infrastructure, as well as taking early steps toward self-governance. "So the story is better than we might be led to believe in the news. I'm indicting the news people. It's a bigger and better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day, which, which, heaven forbid, is awful."     A bigger and better story? Thank you, George, for clarifying your callow, shallow position.     *** END QUOTE ***   This followed a cartoon yesterday by the P-I's  David Horsey  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/horsey/viewbydate.asp?id=914 , which depicted Nethercutt standing up in the middle of a church, raising his hand, and saying: "Hey! Why don't you tell us the good news about Iraq?" The pastor replies: "Sorry, Mr. Nethercutt, maybe after the funeral." (Just to be clear, Nethercutt actually made his comments at the University of Washington, not during a funeral.)    Compare this with the P-I's response  last year  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110002804#daycare , when Sen. Murray gave a speech in which she said the following about Osama bin Laden:    *** QUOTE ***    He's been out in these countries for decades, building schools, building roads, building infrastructure, building day care facilities, building health care facilities, and the people are extremely grateful. We haven't done that.    *** END QUOTE ***   The P-I published an editorial on  Dec. 26  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/101383_murrayed.shtml  praising Murray for, as the headline put it, having the "guts to stir needed debate." The paper praised every bit of Murray's statement, including even the claim about "day care centers"--after all, "there is apparently a long-standing rumor" that bin Laden "built an orphanage."    Now that Americans like Kerry Scott are in Iraq and actually are building hospitals, schools and other facilities, the P-I wants to suppress the news. An  Oct. 11 P-I story  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/143507_soldier11.html  on Scott's death quotes his father, David Scott, as saying of his son: "He was brave. He was a hero. He always wanted to help people." The Seattle Post-Intelligencer seems to have a big emotional investment in the notion that fallen heroes like Kerry Scott gave their lives in vain.

       urlLink Op-Ed Columnist: A Big Quarter   Krugman wastes no time denigrating yesterdays economic news.  He must have had this one written and waiting for a long time.  Krugman:  My purpose is not to denigrate the impressive estimated 7.2 percent growth rate for the third quarter of 2003. It is, rather, to stress the obvious: we've had our hopes dashed in the past, and it remains to be seen whether this is just another one-hit wonder.  Me:  Your purpose is NOT to denigrate the growth rate?  Then why does your entire column do just that?  It seems the Left either 1) dwells on the past as a prediction of the future, 2) ignores the present and say the future might be much worse, or 3) hold thier hands over their ears and repeat "nyah nyah nyah" as loud as they can when confronted with good news.  Krugman: Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley has suggested, plausibly, that much of last quarter's consumer splurge was "borrowed" from the future: consumers took advantage of low-interest financing, cash from home refinancing and tax rebate checks to accelerate purchases they would otherwise have made later. If he's right, we'll see below-normal purchases and slower growth in the months ahead.  Me: I love market people.  You can round up a half dozen in a room and get 6 wildly divergent theories about what the numbers mean.  Most of this colum is a bunch of economspeak, so read at your own risk.  Krugman: Still, it's possible that we really have reached a turning point. If so, does it validate the Bush economic program? Well, no.   Me:  I guess that's all there is to say, eh Paul?  Even if the economy improves, Bush had nothing to do with it.  In fact, it improved DESPITE Bush's best attempts to kill it.  I imagine Bush is sitting the in the White House, fuming in rage that the damned economy improved!  He wants it dead!  He wants more poor, more destitute.  And the economy just keeps coming back like Lazarus, despite his best effort.  Krugman is such a hyper-partisan.  Bush could present the heads of Saddam and Osama, preside over the hotest economy since Reagan, and cure AIDS...but Krugman would blame him for the solar flares.  It really is pathetic that this 'voice of the Left' has devolved to a caricature of himself.

       Reply to Don   Even though I wasn't asked to, I felt I needed to add to Don's email.  First off, glad you liked Kill Bill. Honestly, i didn't like the soundtrack much at all. Odd since I loved his previous soundtracks.  I have to admit I saw Battlefield Earth in a theater. In fact, I went to a sneak preview! It had media people and the whole shebang. I went with a friend who got free tickets. I had no idea what I was going to go see. After the two hour bludgeoning, I remember the vitriol banded about by those in attendance. "Craptacular, Worst move ever!, That sucked!" All of these were heard. I couldn't believe I had just seen millions of dollars wasted up on the screen. If I had paid money to see it I would be too shamed to admit it.  Ine thing that I remember was the absurdly high soled boots. We're talking Japanese School Girl Style. 6" it seemed.

       urlLink Democratic Underground Forums - GDP up 7.2%, we are toast   The denizens of the Democratic Underground greet the news of our raging GDP numbers announced today.  "Sure, I believe these numbers.  Just like I believed that Iraq had WMD. Just like I believed that the 2 taxcuts would create jobs. Just like I believe he won the 2000 election.  Sorry, but if this were truely the case, I think it's solely in the province of the 1% who had $5TT delivered back to them by Dimson. He distorts or kills all data coming from every Department in the federal government, so why would I believe this? A real 7.2% bounce would have this economy raging...that ain't happening."  More -   They ARE getting desperate, but that is only pushing them more swiftly to Totalitarian Heights that were coming anyway.  Yes, comrade, and Toilet Paper Production went up 600% last year.  Even if this number is remotely true and not to be "corrected downward" in a month with no publicity thus remaing in the Public Mind, then it is based on stolen loot from Iraq, stolen loot from the Amerikan Imperial Taxpayer, and the fact that the Busheviks have been increasingly ratcheting up their use of governmental agencies as political platforms.  Just like the Old Soviet Union.  With each year that passes, the Busheviks get closer to that Perfect Soviet 100% lie.  To me, this Soviet-style number indicates that, due to increased desperation and the fact that people are seeing through their old lies, the Busheviks are taking the lies to another level.  I warn you, they are not done ratcheting up and, should the Imperial Family remain in power for decades, we WILL reach that perfect Soviet media atmosphere the Busheviks so admire and desire.  No filters then, just Comrade Bushevik's Unadulterated Truths.

      Don sent two emails today, both are somewhat amusing.    First - Hey Todd, Was watching O'Reilly tonight and was reading the ticker tape news. Former  Pres. Bill Clinton said we should be working hard to make friends instead of  enemies because we can't go around invading, occupying and jailing every  rouge nation out there. Ok maybe not everyone. Wasn't it after GWI that  Usama got upset with the U.S. Wasn't he in power then? Also wasn't it during  his administration that N. Korea started its nuclear program. I don't know  thought I read something about Osama's hatred for America was because we up  and left without helping. Kill Bill vol. I rocks, if you like ultraviolent Q.T. movies. Great sound  track and has his "start the movie at the ending" trademark. Havent seen the  second Matrix movie but the preveiws for the 3rd look awesome. I'm still reading Shogun for God sakes. Started that one back in May but  baseball season is over so now its time to catch up on life. D. Simmons has  a new one out but I want to get "The Elegant Universe" first. Hope the wife  is doing better. Later Don  And then a little later -   Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 .How disappointed were you with  this mess of a movie! L. Ron should come back from the grave and smack Johny T. in the head with  his dick for making that one  End emails.  I have to admit, I managed to not see Battlefield Earth.    I did see the ticker about Clinton's comments that we can't arrest everyone.  I saw another clip where he said he knew about Blair's heart problem before hand (much to the surprise of Tony Blair who never discussed it with him, or apparently knew about it himself), and another comment by the Priapic One about how he knew that AIDS had to be addressed in Africa long before it came to world attention.  I am putting a lot of faith in the ability of History to place Clinton in his proper perspective down the road.  He will always be a small man who squandered opportunity.  The American people got what they deserved with him.

       Random Drivel   Here are some random thoughts rattling around in my head today.  Movies  Kill Bill Vol.1 was actually very good. It is not for everyone of course, as the cartoon violence and basic lack of plot will turn many away. But since I knew it was going to be a stylish expedition into the Hong Kong cinema I was not dissapointed. Being that I am a casual enthusiast of John Woo's good movies such as The Killer and Hard Boiled I recognized many homages. I haven't seen enough movies with samurai swords to notice where Tarentino took those shots from.   If you do enjoy some good action, silly gratuitous blood fountains, and really slick editing and choreography, go see Kill Bill. It's a good two hours of entertainment.  Lord of the Rings  My introduction to Lord of the Rings is strange, to say the least. I had heard about it here and there, since I was somewhat into Science Fiction. I got involved in collectible card games, specifically Magic. Then i see this new game come out, based on Tolkein's world. The thing that got me interested was the artwork. I forget why exactly we began to putz with it at the local comic shop, Titan's. But I was hooked with the RPG-esque play mechanics and the dice rolling. I began to read the little bits of story and info on the cards, and got interested in the world they came from. It seemed fantastic and limitless. Again, the artwork was a major part of my fascination since I am a very visual person.  I decided to find out more about this fantasy world, so I read the three books of the trilogy. Now while they are inferior to many later works, they did have a certain appeal. Some characters, like Gandalf and Theoden appealed to me greatly. I read soem of the auxilliary books about the wrold of Middle Earth and my love for the setting has only grown. SO to me the movies are good mainly because I fell in love with the world I had imagined. The events in the books are like a possible story set in that world. So unlike Todd I can divorce myself from the choices Tolkein made in the books and even those that Peter Jackson has made in the movies.  I feel strongly that Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It fully caputures the essence of the world I envision. It is a huge movie, with a proper sense of grandeur and possibility. I never felt that anything in the move was contrived, or implausible in the world of Middle Earth. Some scenes, such as the Great Hall of Moria, will always be burned into my mind as a perfect image.   The Two Towers, on the other hand, was almost a disaster on the proportions of Episode 1. I realize my rant is going long, so I will save the elaboration of my rage against TTT for another day.  Indiana Jones on DVD  Raider of the Lost Ark is one of the top ten movies of all time. Plain and simple, it does everything right. It's treatment on DVD is excellent. If you enjoyed the Indy movies go and buy the DVD box set. I have seen it going for as little as $45. That's a bargain for 3 good movies.   Politics  The Democrats are not the fountainhead of all that is evil and wrong in the world today. I know it seems that both Todd and I hate them with every fiber of our beings, but it isn't so. The fact is that Todd used to be a Democrat before he began to think about the world. I would probably have been a Democrat back in the 60's. I want things to get better, and I want people to better themselves. I want unity and a common purpose for all Americans: to get richer and enjoy life more fully. The Democratic Party used to want those things too.   I am a social liberal I guess. I believe abortion should be legal, up to a point where the baby can survive outside the womb. This does raise some interesting questions, and may have to be revised as medical science makes earlier and earlier births more viable. I believe that all drugs should be legal. I believe that guns ownership should require no license, and no registration with someone who could come and demand the gun from you. In short, I believe that freedom is something that comes with responsibilities. Bad choices should be available. It is not anyone's place to say what someone else should do as long as no one's rights are infringed upon by the behavior.  Getting back to the subject, the Democratic Party of today is a vindictive, envious group of small men and women. They seek to take from one group and give to another group. THis very concept of group identity angers and sickens me. I am not a group. Americans should not belong to groups. I don't believe in Chinese-Americans, African-Americans, Arab-Americans, etc. It would be more honest to say that there are various socio-economic groups. The Democrats appeal to some of the lower groups. Those groups that see themselves as victims, or inferior to other groups. The problem with this inferiority is that most see it as someone else's fault. So it can be rectified by destroying their oppressors.   The simple fact really is that people seek their own level. Poverty is a disease of the mind. I admit freely that some people in poverty have no hope of escape. Their beginnings preclude advancement. That is a shame, but their children can climb higher. Refusal to do so is a choice. I come from a lower-middle class background. My parents never went to college. My father was a draftsman for 35+ years until his skill became obsolete. He was too old to retrain himself and had made the mistake of never learning new skills. He did pretty well, considering. We have a house and two cars. We eat acceptably well, have TV's, and I am going to college so that I might go further than my father. i do consider myself in poverty, but I am not "poor." Some day my economic Worth will catch up to my internal worth. It always seems to with people.  Zell Miller, a former governor of Georgia and one of the state's Senators has endorsed Bush for President in 2004. When I was a teenager, Miller was governor. He brought the lottery and HOPE scholarships to the state. I am currently taking advantage of the scholorship, and I had a jo for a few moths packaging lotto tickets. That job,btw, taught me that I must finish up my college ASAP. I used to dislike Zell, but now I'm not sure why. My parents had an irrational hatred of him for some reason. His nickname was "Zig-zag Zell" because he apparently changed his position on issues frequently.   Honestly, changing positions doesn't mean all that much to me. It dpes not, despite popular misconception, mean that you are of no principles. Someone who has pronciples set in stone may be admirable, but what if his position turns out to eb wrong? Then he is a fool to not change. To me, Zell Miller's story of coming up from poverty, Marine Corps service, and distinguished record in public service makes him worthy of admiration. His voting record in the Senate shows that he is more in-line with Republican than Democrat positions. Hearing him speak, I can't help but feel the Democratic Party used to be something great. I would vote for him if he was runnign again for Senator. Unfortunately he is retiring at the end of his current term.  I agree with Zell that our current President is the best man available for the job. The jobis to ensure America survives. there are forces in this world that seek our destruction. We do not need to understand their greivances, we onyl need to find them and destroy them. it has always been this way. All societies end up in competition,a nd the superior society triumphs and absorbs the inferior one. Rome was superior in her day, and thus won mastery over the world. Britain was superior for a time, and established the greatest empire ever known. Now America is superior, and we must maintain that dominance. Bush understands that. I understand that. Our enemies understand that. Unfortunately, most Americans do not understand.

       urlLink Eyes Wide Shut   DOWD is back!  And she is as vile as ever!!  Her rant this week includes the usual pack of Bush lies, a reference to the carrier landing, and the obligatory tie of Iraq to Vietnam.  DOWD: "He's my man," Mr. Bush laughingly told Tom Brokaw about the entertaining contortions of Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, a k a "Comical Ali" and "Baghdad Bob," who assured reporters, even as American tanks rumbled in, "There are no American infidels in Baghdad. Never!" and, "We are winning this war, and we will win the war. . . . This is for sure."  Now Crawford George has morphed into Baghdad Bob.  Me:  So Bush is no better than Baghdad Bob.  What a wonderful thing to say about a wartime president.  I wonder if comparisons were made between Tokyo Rose and FDR?  DOWD: Speaking to reporters this week, Mr. Bush made the bizarre argument that the worse things get in Iraq, the better news it is. "The more successful we are on the ground, the more these killers will react," he said.  Me:  What is wrong with this statement?  It is a simple indication that the more we control Iraq, the more desperate the killers will be.  We will see an increase in spectacular attempts, and many will be thrawted.  But DOWD takes it to an illogical conclusion with her next breath.  DOWD: Now Bush illogic continues: The more Americans, Iraqis and aid workers who get killed and wounded, the more it is a sign of American progress. The more dangerous Iraq is, the safer the world is. The more troops we seem to need in Iraq, the less we need to send more troops.  The harder it is to find Saddam, Osama and W.M.D., the less they mattered anyhow. The more coordinated, intense and sophisticated the attacks on our soldiers grow, the more "desperate" the enemy is.  Me:  She misses the point while engaged in a fit of hyperbole.  The natural evolution of Bush's statement is not the doublespeak that she has spewed.  At some point, desperation gives way to error, and we will catch the core of the forces engaged in murdering Iraqis and foreign aid workers.  Desperation is a good thing.  The more bloody and violent, the more likely Joe Iraqi will get tired of it and turn someone over.  Is this not clear?  DOWD: The war began with Bush illogic: false intelligence (from Niger to nuclear) used to bolster a false casus belli (imminent threat to our security) based on a quartet of false premises (that we could easily finish off Saddam and the Baathists, scare the terrorists and democratize Iraq without leeching our economy).  Me:  Now I feel better.  I haven't heard her invoke the Bush Lies argument in a week or so.    DOWD: Mr. Bush looked buck-passy when he denied that the White House, which throws up PowerPoint slogans behind his head on TV, was behind the "Mission Accomplished" banner. And Donald Rumsfeld looked duplicitous when he acknowledged in a private memo, after brusquely upbeat public briefings, that America was in for a "long, hard slog" in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Me: There's the banner reference.  And I've been waiting on the howling over the Rumsfeld memo for awhile.  Nice that she has not dissapointed me.    The Rumsfeld memo.  Imagine for a moment that you are Bill Gates, with all the money and all the market position.  You are doing well.  Forecasts are strong, income is up, and your shareholders are happy.  But there is this company called Netscape out there, trashing a little of your market share and adopting new tactics.  Should Gates ignore it because things are going pretty well?  Or should he task his staff to look at things like they are on the brink of extinction, and to divert all resources, creativity and money toward remaking themselves, to do even better than they are now?  Which is the action of a prudent businessman?  The Rumsfeld memo is just that.  It is a challenge to his staff that things can be better, even if they are decent right now.  You don't go out in public and say "We are doing well by today's standards, but I really fear that unless we undertake major change in our organization, we will all be dead in 10 years."  You DON'T do that.  You continue being successful in todays world, while you tear things apart behind closed doors and get ready for tomorrow's battle.  Of course, DOWD either knows this and enjoys spinning distortion, or she truly is an idiot.  I'll leave the choice to your personal preference.  DOWD: But the fear of young American soldiers who don't speak the language or understand the culture, who don't know who's going to shoot at them, was captured in a front-page picture in yesterday's Times: two soldiers leaning down to search the pockets of one small Iraqi boy.  Me: And this segment goes beyond any bounds of common sense.  DOWD is ruffled over the search of an innocent Iraqi boy, but I bet she has no problems with an Airport Goon patting down a three year old girl from Chicago while the Pakistani foreign national goes right on to his seat without any extra search.  Liberals are only outraged when it suits them.  DOWD goes on to invoke the noted authority, Neil Sheehan, Pulitzer Prize winning author of "A Bright Shining Lie".  That particular book is a typical anti-Vietnam screed, and since it won the Pulitzer, it must have plenty of anti-American ravings contained within.  Mr Sheehan trots into the column to compare Robert McNamara to Wolfowitz.  DOWD: Neil Sheehan, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "A Bright Shining Lie," recalls Robert McNamara making Wolfowitz-like trips to Vietnam, spotlighting good news, yearning to pretend insecure areas were secure.  "McNamara was in a jeep in the Mekong Delta with an old Army colonel from Texas named Dan Porter," Mr. Sheehan told me. "Porter told him, `Mr. Secretary, we've got serious problems here that you're not getting. You ought to know what they are.' And McNamara replied: `I don't want to hear about your problems. I want to hear about your progress.' "  "If you want to be hoodwinked," Mr. Sheehan concludes, "it's easy."    Me:  Bob McNamara, if there is any justice, will be burning in hell.  But to compare the two situations is ludicrous.  The Generals on the ground are running this conflict.  If the Left had it's way, our political concerns would dictate our military actions, which is precisely what gave us Vietnam in the first place.  Welcome back DOWD.

Interesting that an event that occured six months ago is still provoking fury and hatred from the Left.  As for Bush trying to 'blame' others, I'm not reading it that way at all.  The crew suggested it, his staff made the banner.  He isn't distancing himself from it - he's being accurate about the origins of the sign since the press is obsessed with it.

      It's been a quiet day in the news.  DOWD must be on vacation, no doubt fuming in her own hatred of Dubbya.  I don't really care about the wildfires in Kahlefornia, and the background noise in Iraq isn't really worth commenting on, since the Left's wailing is nothing new.  The Matrix: Revolutions opens next Wednesday.  After Reloaded, the Matrix series is poised to be one of the greatest genre films, but it could still go poorly if Revolutions returns to a tired Hollywood predictability.  While I anticipate it, I fear what it might become.  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King will be out in a month or so.  Unfortunately, I could care less about this one after having the ending revealed to me.  It really is a pity that Tolkein was such a wuss.  I could go on a long rant, but who would really want to read it?  You know, on the entertainment front, there isn't really a lot for me to look forward to.  Anyone want to start a movie debate?

       urlLink Drug Profits and the Free Market (5 Letters)   I did not read the column referenced here, and I'll try to later.  As an employee of Evil Big Pharma, I have a vested interest in drug profits.  As a consumer, I also have a vested interest in drug profits.  It is essential that pharma is profitable.  We here all the time about the high cost of drugs, and the massive expense of research.  Unfortunately, I don't think people really have a mental handle on what that means.  It can cost $500 million dollars to take a drug from the lab to the market.  It can cost $100 million to even find out if a molecule has any pharmakinetic benefit.  The internal numbers here at Pfizer reveal that 97% of all candidates fail, but each candidate consumes tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.  Part of the high cost of drugs flow from the fact that the US is subsidizing price controls all over the world.  Canada is the biggest example.  The Canadian government caps the prices at an artificial level.  The Pharmas don't make much profit, if any, in those markets.  If we refuse to sell drugs there, Canada has threatened to void our patents on those drugs and begin production of generics.  Illegal Canadian generics would cut into the market in other nations, just as legal patented drugs are doing now.  In effect, Canada is saying "sell to us cheap or we will just take it."  What can we do?  We sell to Canada and try to get our money back in other markets by raising the price.  So in effect, when you buy a drug here, you are paying the cost of the Canadian, the Frenchman, the Brit, the German and so on.  All places with price caps are driving up the price here.  The answer is not to cap our prices and stifle research.  We aren't going to provide new drugs unless there is money in it.  Market forces will prevail.  The answer is to apply pressure to remove price caps overseas, and to reduce the regulatory burden on new drug approvals.  Pfizer doesn't pay $500 million to bring a drug to market....you pay.    Twenty years ago, there were a dozen R&D drug companies based in Canada.  Today there are zero.  Most major pharmas are pulling out of Europe and coming here.  This is the last bastion of free market economics in the medical industry, and that isn't entirely true since the health care system is a bastardization of the free market with Stalinesque controls.

      To make up for the lack of Blogging yesterday, I decided to post this.  Mark had asked me on behalf of a friend to shed some light on the Palestinian mess.  I replied with the following email and a link to a great book if you really want to examine the issue in depth.  Also note that my brief narrative is simplistic - the real issue is quite a bit more complicated, but I try to hit the major points.  Begin Email   The area known as Palestine has been sporadically settled by Jews since the early 1800s.  The land was largely unpopulated, aside from nomadic Arab cultures through most of the time.  The Jews in the area experimented with communism from the early days, forming collectives in their villages to survive the harsh conditions, but over time they managed to 'green' the area through irrigation programs and hard work.  Ironically, as the Jewish population expanded through the 1910s, the corresponding Arab population increased as Arabs flocked in to work on Jewish farms and industry.  They came for the jobs.  Through this time, the region fell under the British Empire, and in the early 1920s, through extensive lobbying, the British Jews convinced Britain to open up the area for increased Jewish settlement.  The Balfour declaration established the first recognition of a Zionist state by a European power.  Strangely enough, the British has considered Uganda as a potential home, but the Zion Congress would not accept that land.    The timeline for handing over the region remained a point of contention for a very long time, going well through WWII.  Understandably, the powers were a little occupied at the time.  After WWII and when the Holocaust became evident, there was a growing pressure to formalize the state of Israel.      Jewish settlement began in larger numbers after WWII, but England continued to delay the handover and reduce the numbers that would permitted to settle there.  In fact, there was a growing sense of Anti-Semitism in the English foreign policy, resulting in some violent clashes in Israel.  Monachim Begin, a later Prime Minister of Israel, and one of the principles at the Camp David accords with Anwar Sadat in the late 70s, belonged to a terrorist group seeking to oust England.  They blew up the King David hotel in 1946, killing 91, mostly British officers.  The violence stemmed from a British anti-immigration stance, resulting in the continued slaughter of Jews in Soviet client states after the war.  The Jewish National Congress condemned all such terrorism and worked hard to stomp it out, but violence continued.  Finally, in 1948 the state of Israel was proclaimed with a partition plan.  The land that is now Israel was part of the Kingdom of Jordan, also a British protectorate.  Almost immediately, Egypt and Syria, along with Jordanian factions, attempted to crush Israel resulting in the Genesis War of 1948.  The Arabs were beaten, but at a great cost to Israel.  In another twist, the greatest friend to Israel in this hour of need was Germany.  In compensation, the Israeli's retained some conquered land to maintain a security perimeter.  Jordan seized the lands designated for the 'Palestinians', and they still hold it.    Subsequent wars over the next twenty years (Yom Kippur War, Six Days War etc) resulted in massive, horrible defeats of Egypt, Jordan and Syria, with more and more land being taken by Israel as compensation for Arab aggression.  These wars were launched by Arabs with the stated intent of 'washing the shores of Galilee with Jewish blood'.  Finally, at the Camp David accords, a lot of this land was handed back to the Arabs in exchange for a security agreement.  The agreement lasted less than six months before the rhetoric, bombings and arms buildups began again.  When Israel was formed in 1948, they begged the Arabs to remain in their country and live together.  This is well documented.  The Arabs left, moving to the camps in anticipation of returning after a quick Arab conquest of Israel.  They are still waiting.  No other Arab country will accept these refugees into their lands, preferring to maintain the camps as a PR ploy, while breeding hatred through poverty and humiliation.  In a nutshell, that is where we are today.    http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679765638/qid=1067267881/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-8488061-4022207?v=glance&s=books  This is really 900+ pages of history condensed in one email.  If it sounds like I am pro-Israel, keep in mind that I used to be pro-Palestinian until I began to research.  Really, the Arabs have this wrong, and unfortunately, it seems the rest of the world are behind them.

       urlLink Decoding Rumsfeld's Memo   Predictably, the NYT Editorial Board decides to twist and contort the Rumsfeld memo into something that it isn't.  NYT: This page has long argued that the war on terrorism must consist of more than a series of triumphal military offensives, especially when some of these, like the war in Iraq, bear no clear relation to the terrorist threat.   Me:  A double whammy of idiocy.  If the war 'must' consist of more than a series of triumphal military offensives, does that mean we must include some losses as well?  What does that mean?  I love how these people use mandatory words like 'must' and 'is' when the premise is still open for debate.  The fact remains - our actions in Afghanastan and Iraq have been positive in the war on Terror.  And again, this silly notion that Iraq had nothing to do with terror is easily put to bed by Saddam's involvement in financing Palestinian bombers and funding terror camps in Iraq.  These facts are not debatable.    NYT: Mr. Rumsfeld's big problem is that he seems to want to run almost every aspect of the war on terror but prefers to share the blame when things do not work out. Now he muses about forming a new institution that "seamlessly focuses the capabilities of several departments and agencies" on the problem of terrorism. He helpfully suggested that this new institution might be located within the Defense Department — or maybe elsewhere.   Talking about such a change seems logical. But Mr. Rumsfeld is astute enough to realize that an administration that has just created the Department of Homeland Security is not likely to start all over again any time soon. Perhaps he is really making a case for another huge increase in the Pentagon's already swollen budget.  Me: I love this.  The NYT tries to reconstruct what Rumsfeld REALLY meant by his memo, and then after placing a spin on his words, proceed to blast him for a position he has never put forth.  Behold!  NYT: America spends nearly $400 billion a year on defense, as much in real terms as when the main threat came from the Soviet military. Mr. Rumsfeld has rightly sought funds for 21st-century weapons systems adapted to fighting terrorism. But he has failed to make corresponding cuts in weapons systems that are no longer justified. And while he deserves credit for pushing toward leaner, more mobile military strategies, he has damaged other vital elements of the war on terrorism by gratuitously insulting important allies and pressuring intelligence agencies to come up with conclusions that support his views.  President Bush should ponder his defense secretary's latest musings about the war on terrorism, but firmly resist any further expansion of Mr. Rumsfeld's budget or bureaucratic empire.  Me: Go read either the Bob Woodward book, or the one by Bill Sammon on the aftermath of 9/11.  Read the internal workings of the President's cabinent and get a true image of Rumsfeld.  We are fortunate to have him in place.

       urlLink The Cheney Curse - The veep hasn't helped Halliburton. He has hurt it. By Daniel Gross   This is a riot.  First, we hear that evil Halliburton is reaping vast rewards from the machinations of Cheney.  They are making windfall profits on no-bid contracts, and making out on the blood of our soldiers in Iraq.  Now the truth comes out, and we find that Halliburton is actually having some trouble.  Their financial performance is sub-par, and in some projects, they are bleeding cash.  So the critics take a new tack - Halliburton's woes are evidence of Cheney's incompetance!  How convenient!  Amazing how the facts can easily be mutated to support the premise the Cheney is either evil or incompetent.  The plasticity of the Left is an amazing thing to behold.

       Additional NK Thoughts   Todd,  I don’t really oppose the action you advocate. I just wish that there was a conceivable alternative. There must be evil in this world to force us to this. I just don’t want millions to die over this, but I guess there can be no other outcome. Can our leaders summon the courage and will to make it happen? Do they see it as we do? Are we deceived? Is this situation really as we see it?   I don’t want to see us use atomic weapons, but I will back their use if it is necessary. We must be ready to own the consequences of this in a way similar to how we owned Japan after the war. We have abrogated responsibility in Iraq. It seems we are unwilling to boldly remake it as it should be. If we do anything to defeat NK, we should do everything to remake it. This was our problem in the 50’s, and we ran from it then. Now we face the high price of inaction.  I desire a good outcome to this, but all I see are terrible and more terrible futures. If the 90’s were a decade of irrational exuberance, then the 00’s are a decade of pessimism.

      Another thought.  If we do indeed wait to be struck first, what do we do then?  If NY or DC vanishes in a flash, what do we do?  Who would you have us hit?  Who is responsible?  Would you then advocate the strategic strike on Pongyang or Tehran or Damascus?  Would the deaths of millions of citizens of these cities, who had little to do with the actions of thier leaders, be justified?  Does 'an eye for an eye' salve your conscience?  Or is it better to prevent this scenario through action against those that wear the uniform of rogue states?  Perhaps they are just as innocent, but they have made a choice to serve such a regime.  Consider the logical outcome of inaction.

      Much to respond to.  I thought both Mike and Don have good points, but I still don't entirely agree.  Also, I must point out again that the course of action I see is not what I WANT, it is merely what I see as unavoidable.    First, Mike's two objections.  He is correct is stating that America, historically, does not strike first.  We are not that kind of people.  Someone said once that the problem with America is that we do not believe in Evil.  At first glance, I did not like that statement, but I learned that it is indeed true.  It is in our nature to always be optimistic.  We believe there is good in people.  We have a hard time accepting that people will do terrible things, until we are confronted with evidence.  This naive belief kept us out of WW II, and it continues to harm us today.  We didn't believe Iraq would actually invade Kuwait.  We didn't believe that Terror would come here.  We didn't believe that Saddam had WMD (some still don't believe he was a threat).  This world view, while noble, is starting to be a danger to us.    I don't like the idea of America striking first, but I see no other way to protect ourselves.  Must we wait for the nuclear flash before we believe?  To do so places trust in the self-restraint of madmen.  Don postulated that if we embrace the first strike principle, then it is as if we decided to nuke the SOviet Union first.  I don't agree with the analogy.  The Soviet Union was populated by rational people, even if we didn't agree.  They did not seek the death of civilization, which is what an exchange would have created.  Same for the Chinese.  They want to join the civilized world, and they won't use these weapons.  There is no need to strike them when the old doctrine of MAD applies.  Mutual Assured Destruction implies that both parties wish to avoid destruction.  What do you do when one side does not care about being destroyed?  Where is the deterrent?  Honestly, if NK has nuclear weapons, I don't fear THEM.  I fear their stated willingness to sell them to anyone for cash.  I don't really care if Saddam had Nukes, except for the knowledge that he will give them to any enemy of America with a smile.  What was the line?  I don't fear the man who has a thousand warheads.  I fear the man who just wants one.  Would Bin Laden trade NY for Damascus?  He would celebrate both!    The idea that America does not strike first is fine, when the threat of the first strike is limited to a military target and a small number of casualties.  I'm not willing to sacrifice millions to a noble idea whose time might have passed.  As for divining intent, I must resort to analogy.  My apologies.  Suppose an insane neighbor has spent the past three months telling you he is going to kill you.  One morning, you are out with your family, taking a walk.  Then you see your neighbor driving 100 MPH right at you with a grin on his face.  Must you wait for the impact before you take action?  He hasn't actually hit you, and he could still turn away.  Doing nothing puts you at the mercy of his self restraint.  Our enemies have made threats for generations, and they are now getting the means to make good on the threats.  How long must we wait?  The Nuclear Taboo is something else entirely.  Mike has already conceeded that a taboo is irrational, so I don't need to talk about that aspect.  The practical consideration revolves around the perceived horror of these weapons.  Killing is killing, and more people died in the Tokyo firebombing over the span of one night than died in Hiroshima.  A tool is a tool, and if the tool saves lives by taking them, then it must be used.  This irrational fear of tactical nuclear weapons merely deters the good guys.  In this case, the utility of the tool can make a shorter, less costly war possible.  The alternative is to embark on a conventional conflict and sustain heavy casualties on both sides.    Do you require the death of allied soldiers simply to avoid the emotional recoil of a nuclear weapon?  Should we have invaded Japan to save the residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?  You know the answer in your hearts.  Again, I'm not saying Nuke Pyongyang or Tehran.  I'm saying it might be neccesary to use small nukes on installations and troop gatherings, to save allied lives.  Regretable, but as we know, war is serious business.  If I may interpret Mike, I believe in his heart he knows his reasons are not good, but he cannot let go of his idea.  In truth, if you all agreed with me, I would be worried.  These are not easy ideas to accept, and I've been struggling with them for a long time.

       On Nukes   Todd has brought this up, so I feel I have to clarify what I guess is the "moral high-ground."   I feel that the USA is more than a nation, a population, or a geographical domain. It is a culture, an idea. In the modern age wars are fought between cultures as well as between nations. Our war in Iraq is actually a front in our war against Islam. You must face reality and realize that Islam is incompatible with the culture of the USA. They are only tolerable right now because they are a tiny minority with no power. I personally feel that Islam should cease to exist. There is no "moderate" Islam. Their book tells them to kill infidels. Their religion is an anachronism, and to bring reason to it is to totally change it. If it can be done, that is fine. But Islam as it stands is the enemy of the modern world.  We are at war with Islam. Fortunately it is an enemy riddled with internal division. Guns must be used against the more radical, money and reason against the more moderate. I am sure Islam will eventually die, as Christianity is slowly dying. The rigid ways must give way to reality. Science can replace superstition. Prosperity obviates the need for piety. But something I hope never dies is the fundamental truth that the USA was built upon. That men are free, that they are created equal, and that the rule of law is supreme.  If we do as Todd suggests and attack NK without warning, using tactical nukes if necessary, what does that do to who we are? I cannot honestly say that there is a more expedient way to solve this crisis. It probably would make things easier for us in the world as well. States like Pakistan would be more compliant knowing that we will not refrain from attack. But morally I think that way would destroy the USA that I love.  Japan attacked us at Pearl Harbor to prevent us from interfering with their Pacific ambitions. They had tried to reach some agreement with us for a time before hand. We replied to their ambitions with an oil embargo. Their attack was actually inevitable. Is our attack on NK similarly inevitable? Is NK a threat to our plans?   They seek to disrupt the order we have imposed in the region. They seek nuclear weapons. This in itself is not really a threat, since if they actually use them it is over for them. But the threat is that they might sell them to others, or be crazy enough to attack with them.   If dimplomacy fails, as it almost always does, we will be forced to take some action. What form that action may take is under debate in this forum. Should we strike first, or should we wait to be struck? Under what conditions should we attack? What should we attack? What should victory be defined as?   Todd advocates a complete attack, destroying almost all capability to make war by NK. This may need nuclear weapons, as their defense structures are almost impregnable. The problem with attacking NK is that they have the capability and the will to make South Korea into a wasteland almost instantly. A sneak attack with nuclear weapons would eliminate that capability. A conventional campaign would provide more than enough warning to allow NK to attack or counterattack at their leisure. The troop buildup, the air basing, the carrier groups needed would be so obvious and vunerable that it almost makes nuclear weapons preferrable.  I can boil my objections to Todd's plan down to two things:  1) America doesn't strike first.  2) There is a powerful taboo on the use of nukes. Do we want to remove the taboo?  First and most importantly, if we attack with no warning, no ultimatum then we are essentially becoming the bad guy. Germany attacked with no warning, no diplomacy. Japan attacked us when diplomacy failed, and Iraq attacked Kuwait with no provocation. The aggressor is always judged to be the bad guy. It helps though that the aggressor is usually defeated. I suppose I am using the Leftist angle against Iraq here. That liek Iraq, NK is no clear and present danger to us. I am intellectually dishonest, since I favored this attack on Iraq. That was to force change on the Arab world. It was an agressive and bold move to reshape the world. And honestly it was an enterprise with very little real danger. NK is far different.  If we don't attack first, if we issue demands and they are not met, then we will have to use conventional forces to attack NK. They may attack first, or counterattack. Seol might be obliterated. SK might face invasion. We may have to use nukes to arrest NK's advance. China or Russia might become involved. Japan might need to intervene as well. A massive force will be needed. Someone will have to occupy NK. This will make Iraq seem like a vacation, a weekend cruise.   The fact is that the first strike is the best option. I do not feel it is the morally correct option. I would favor an ultimatum, and it would leave us vunerable. We would inform NK that any test of nuclear weapons will trigger an atttack. But at the same time we must force them to either test or dismatle. We will also inform them that we will attack any nuclear facilites if they continue to be operational. In short, we would force them to hti us first. If the political will is lacking to strike them first, it is the only way to force the issue. If we don't force the issue, we face a terrorist nuclear detonation on American soil.  Secondly, the nuclear taboo. A taboo is an irrational and deeply ingrained aversion to something. The world sees using neuclear weapons as an atrocity, something to be avoided at all costs. Their very presence in the world frightens some people. Not me. The only thing I fear is that those who do not fear them may come into possession of them. Terrorists and Muslims are those kind of people. The danger of NK is that they would give them to those people. So we must act to prevent them from acquiring them. But if we use nukes to stop them, it will show that their use is acceptable and in fact necessary. Pakistan and India might actually use them if they go to war.  Admittedly the only thing preventing their general use is the fact that an enemy has them. Isreal is here today ebcause of their Samson denfense. They actually can trade land for peace because their strength lies in nukes. I am a victim of the taboo since I don't want to see them used. Perhas they should be used as just another tool in our arsenal. NK may eb the only situation in which their use could be neemed as necessary. I fear use would signal to natons like Japan and Taiwan that they need nukesto defend themselves.   No matter what is done to solve the problem of NK, the world will not be the same. If we do nothing, if we cave in, if we attack, if we drop the Bomb, everything will change. I am glad we have competant people in the White House to make this decision for us, since this is the most important problem in our world today.

      It didn't take Don long to respond to my 'pro-nuke' commentary.  Here is his reply.  I don't have time right this minute to go into it, but I will as soon as I get back from a meeting.  Email starts  Wow Todd, that's some strong shit your talking. I don't know how to respond  to that. Its to bad the world hates us for getting into others affairs.  Maybe we should of had a "Prime Directive" and not interfere unless asked or  not at all. I don't agree with what you say. I don't think we should act alone. Let the  world deal with it. It never happened during the cold war whose to say it  will happen now. 9/11 or not. Can we really just go in and kill people and  say "Well, you might have attacked us" Why not try to be friends instead of  the aggressor. I don't know Todd but that first strike talk just sounds  crazy. Can you justify killing somebody because of something they might do.  Sounds like Minority Report. Then we should have nuked the USSR but they  would have done the same to us. So nuke the small guy back to the stone age  and then say "I'm sorry we had to do that. Sorry thousands had to die Here  take your country back and don't do it again But we'll help rebuild what we  destroyed. Friends?" I know this is not much of a response but it just sounds crazy.

       urlLink Pakistan, Saudi Arabia in secret nuke pact - The Washington Times: World   More signs of the Apocolypse.  Honestly, in the past year, I have grown more convinced that a nuclear future is in the cards.  I suppose it is just a matter of time as non-prolifieration as a concept is abandoned.  Unstable states with no concept of civilization will obtain these weapons, and it is just a matter of 'when', not 'if', they will be used upon us.  America has to accept a new set of Principles.  We have always stood for self-determination, freedom, and a benign projection of power to attempt to stabilize the world.  Those principles are no longer adequate.  It is anethema to our ideas, but we must be prepared to actively seek Hegemony.  Preferably in concert with the civilized world, but should they fail to join us, we must do so on our own.  We must strike first, strike hard, and tear down states that insist on pursuing the means to slaughter us.  I believe we must expand our military, and use it often and without warning.  I believe we must adopt a policy of first strike, with all that we have, including the nuclear option.    Sounds horrible, doesn't it?  But I see no other way.  The barbarians have been operating within the bounds of our well known limits.  They know how far they can go, and unfortunately, those limits permit them to pursue technologies that cannot be allowed to exist.  We have restrained ourselves for too long, and the time has come to kill.  Our critics in Europe and our enemies in Arabia will never like us, and we should not seek their approval for saving the world.  Our restraint should not be part of a policy of making friends.  It should be a tool to serve the means of our survival.  At some point, I believe this war will elevate to the level of Culture vs. Culture.  There will be little choice between survival and extermination.  We must be prepared to change the Culture of our enemy whenever possible, and if that fails, destroy them.  Obviously, I would prefer Change, but if a Culture continues to breed hatred in an era where one man can kill millions, what are our choices?  I had an interesting conversation with Mike last night about North Korea (henceforth known as NK for brevity).  I invite him to expand on his position, but I will try to represent it to the best of my ability.  I believe that we should keep open the option of using Tactical Nuclear Weapons on NK at the drop of a hat should they continue to develop weapons.  I don't believe we can't hit them effectively enough, quickly enough, and with sufficient surprise through our traditional arsenal in a way to be certain we stop them.  Seoul is 20 miles from the DMZ, and millions can be killed in minutes.  The NK army cannot defeat us over a protracted struggle, but they can slaughter millions, and potentially export these weapons in the time it would take us to overthrow Kim Jong-Il.    This leads me to the concept of a nuclear strike.  I don't want to see it happen, but I see no other alternative that doesn't put a great many people in danger.  If millions might die, then I would prefer we change that into thousands, and those thousands should be wearing NK uniforms.  I'm not advocating the Strategic Nuking of Pyongyang.  These strikes would be targeted on Nuclear installations, military bases, and troop formations on the DMZ.    In addition, we need to send the message that we are no longer constrained by the artificial bounds of our own ethics.  It is regrettable, but we need to face up to the new world we find ourselves in.    Mike thinks that we must accept the first blow before we can hit back with righteous nuclear fire.  I understand the thinking, since it is a position I had before 9/11.  However, it is an ethic I no longer think we can afford.  Yes, if we adopt a pre-emptive nuclear strategy, the world will hate us.  I submit that they hate us already.  Other nuclear states such as China and Russia might fear our actions, but I believe the cold rationale of our actions will help them see that we are focused on madmen.  We have a long history of co-existence with a hostile nuclear power, so long as that power shared our love for life.  The barbarians do not, and they cannot be counted upon to uphold their end of the deterrent.    I don't buy the argument that a nuclear first strike will set a precedent, since evil people are going to use these weapons no matter what.  So long as the holders of the weapon love life more than devestation, cooler heads will prevail.  Pakistan and India are at each other's throats, but they are rational people (for the moment....stay tuned).  That conflict can be stabilized so long as Pakistan remains a sensible power.  But I have little hope for the future of that region.  If Pakistan is indeed willing to export the technology, then they too must go.  Again, we find Islam at the heart of a hotspot.  Discarding my humanity for a moment, I would prefer to see the India/Pakistan conflict go nuclear.  India would burn Pakistan down to a cinder, but would suffer heavy losses.  I have nothing against India, but to be brutally honest, I'd prefer Indian dead over American dead.  And a Pakistani wasteland would take care of the problem quickly and effectively.  Uncomfortable yet?  I don't like it either, but find another way.    The situation is like an anology I posited to Mike last night.  We are the karate expert, and every night a bunch of thugs try to pick a fight with us in the bar.  We avoid it, not from fear, but from restraint.  The time has come for the karate expert to break legs, gouge eyes and break necks, as brutally, effectively and graphically as possible.  It must be like the hammer of God coming down and laying waste to those that need teaching.    Anything else encourages the barbarians, and one day, they will kill us.  Is it better to be noble and dead, or practical and alive?  We can only value life within the bounds of the value that life has for itself.

       urlLink USATODAY.com - Defense memo: A grim outlook     So Rumsfeld writes a memo to the Pentagon heads to prompt some discussion about the War on Terror, and not surprisingly, the outlook is grim.  What infuriates me is the predictable response from the Left this will provoke.  We will be subjected to cries of "We were right!" and "Bush is a failure!".    My rage knows no bounds about the attitude of the Left.  What do they want us to do?  They love to throw rocks, but they have no ideas of thier own.  What else can we do about terror other than try to fight it?  We have nuclear proliferation, rogue states, and a UN that lacks any interest in dealing with the problem?  What should we do?  In my view, the Bush policy doesn't go far enough.  But I am rational enough to understand there are a lot of things happening that I am unaware of, and probably won't find out in my lifetime.  I have to trust that the leadership we have understands the magnitude of the threat and are acting, both in overt and covert means.  Of course the war on Terror is going to be hard.  Yes, it is going to cost us billions, only to be undone by millions.  But what is the answer?  Give up?  Retreat?  Let barbarism rule the world?  Billions for defence, not one penny in tribute.    And I can't wait to hear DOWD about the idea that terrorists are being created faster than we can kill them.  Does she really think the terror will stop if we stop fighting them?  Oh yes, the Islamic Fanatics were so moderate before we started standing up for civilization.  The constant braying on the Left is more than just dutiful, needed, political dissent.  It is starting to morph into an active, treasonous poison that is wearing away at our resolve.  It is fine to question our actions, but the Left is now posing the idea that we must retreat from the battle.  I don't think it is a stretch to say that they actively desire failure in exchange for political gain.  In the days after 9/11, I had hope that there would be progress.  After all, how can there be political nuance to the concept of defending America?  Today, it seems that even the concept of defending ourselves and building a safer world aren't even agreed upon.  It is one thing to battle ourselves on how to kill the enemy.  Now we are mired in the debate over wether we SHOULD kill the enemy.  Everywhere, I see our will to fight being sapped.  I see a weariness.  People want to bring the soldiers home and close the door, pretending that the oceans that have protected us in the past will continue to do so.  We are losing heart, and the incessent drumbeat of negativism is tearing us down.  I truly believe that if we loose the will to do what must be done, the world is ultimately doomed to a repressive culture of fear.  The madmen will always be out there, and our encouragement by retreat will simply amplify the horror when our day comes.  The Rumsfeld Memo is a prudent, needed mechanism of introspection.  Unfortunately, it will be seen by the less mature as a desperate, undermining confession of incompetence.

      Today's Best of the Web has a thing or two to say about Paul Krugman.  Excerpt: Can former Enron adviser Paul Krugman get any nuttier? We'd have said no, but then we read today's column. Krugman weighs in on last week's anti-Jewish tirade by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, and the results boggle the mind.    Krugman begins by characterizing Mahathir's comments as "inexcusable," but then goes on to make excuses for them. "Mr. Mahathir is a cagey politician, who is neither ignorant nor foolish," Krugman explains. The anti-Semitism is "rhetorical red meat" for the rabble, "part of a delicate balancing act aimed at domestic politics." And anyway, it wasn't even the central theme of Mahathir's speech:    *** QUOTE ***    Most of it is criticism directed at other Muslims, clerics in particular. Mr. Mahathir castigates "interpreters of Islam who taught that acquisition of knowledge by Muslims meant only the study of Islamic theology." Thanks to these interpreters, "the study of science, medicine, etc. was discouraged. Intellectually the Muslims began to regress." A lot of the speech sounds as if it had been written by Bernard Lewis, author of "What Went Wrong," the best-selling book about the Islamic decline.    *** END QUOTE ***   If Krugman is right, this is terrific news. The leader of a Muslim country is confronting his fellow Muslim rulers with hard truths, in the manner of Bernard Lewis, no less. But in the twisted mind of Paul Krugman, this is evidence of "how badly things are going for U.S. foreign policy." And of course it's all President Bush's fault:    *** QUOTE ***    Not long ago Washington was talking about Malaysia as an important partner in the war on terror. Now Mr. Mahathir thinks that to cover his domestic flank, he must insert hateful words into a speech mainly about Muslim reform. That tells you, more accurately than any poll, just how strong the rising tide of anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism among Muslims in Southeast Asia has become. Thanks to its war in Iraq and its unconditional support for Ariel Sharon, Washington has squandered post-9/11 sympathy and brought relations with the Muslim world to a new low.    *** END QUOTE ***   So, to summarize Krugman's argument: Normally, when a "cagey" Muslim ruler "castigates" theocratic elements of his society, he feels no need to "protect his domestic flank." If only Saddam Hussein still ruled Iraq and America opposed Israel's efforts to protect its citizens from terrorism, there would be no anti-Semitism in the Islamic world.     "Somewhere in Pakistan," Krugman concludes, "Osama bin Laden must be enjoying this." Bin Laden is a sadistic man indeed if he takes pleasure in watching Krugman's unraveling.   End Excerpt.

       urlLink OpinionJournal - Extra   This is an extremely long article on the nuclear threat around the world.  Well worth reading, if you have the time.  In short, the assessment of North Korea is both chilling and encouraging.    Quote - Not only does the North appear to have deliverable nuclear weapons, it also has one of the world's largest armies, comprising 1.2 million soldiers, some 70% of whom are positioned in and around the 12,000 underground bunkers near the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas. These forces are armed with approximately 10,000 artillery pieces and over 800 missiles capable of reaching South Korea and some of its neighbors. In addition, they are equipped with 2,500 multiple-rocket launchers capable of firing (by a conservative estimate) 500,000 shells an hour to a range of 33 miles. The city of Seoul, situated 24 miles from the DMZ and with a population of more than 10 million, could be devastated within hours.  That is the bad news. The better news is that North Korea is not 10 or even six feet tall. Its military equipment consists of aging Soviet and Chinese stocks that qualitatively are vastly inferior to both the U.S. and South Korean militaries. Its army is large to the point of bloat; significant numbers of conscripts are engaged in forced-labor projects that have little or no military significance. The populace from which these troops are drawn is hungry and downtrodden, and many soldiers are undoubtedly hungry as well. It is an open question whether, if push came to war, North Korea's military would disintegrate on its own, and with it the communist regime.  End quote  I've always beleived that if we kicked North Korea hard enough, and quickly enough, it would come apart like a ripe melon.  I don't believe their people have the will and strength to fight for a regime that is slowly killing them.  It would not be bloodless, but the alternative is a rouge nuclear state willing to export the technology to anyone and everyone.  We cannot live in such a world.  The unpleasant reality is that Kim Jong-Il must go by any means neccesary, and that includes mass casualties on all sides.  The world is still as dangerous as it was during the Cold War, perhaps even more dangerous.  We can pay the price today under terms of our chosing, or we can pay the price through the loss of millions in one of our major cities, along with the destruction of our way of life.  Which would you prefer?

       urlLink Listening to Mahathir   Paul Krugman driving me insane this morning.  He advocates the idea that Muslims are incapable of producing a leader, blames anti-Semitism on Bush, and postulates that what we need is more appeasement to reach Muslims.  Krugman: The fact is that Mr. Mahathir, though guilty of serious abuses of power, is in many ways about as forward-looking a Muslim leader as we're likely to find.   Me:  Mahathir Mohamed is the Prime Minister of Malaysia, who recently made anti-Semitic comments I documented in this blog a few days ago.  So Krugman is speculating that a crazed Jew hater is the best Muslim leader we are likely to find.  I'm no apologist for Islam, but I still believe that the sensible Muslims are out there, and they must be found.  They need a Martin Luther to metaphorically nail something the the Mosque door and reform their religion.  Blanket statements like Krugman's suggest, in the faint racism of the Left, that some people just aren't capable of handling freedom due to their ethnicity.  The Left does this all the time - Iraq can't be free, Blacks have trouble voting, Hispanics can't learn English.  It is offensive.  Krugman - Malaysia has a Muslim, ethnically Malay, majority, but its business drive comes mainly from an ethnic Chinese minority. To keep the economy growing, Mr. Mahathir must allow the Chinese minority to prosper, but to ward off ethnic tensions he must throw favors, real and rhetorical, to the Malays.   Me - I don't know the details of Malay economics, but to say that the Chinese are the engine, while the majority Malays are incapable of supporting thier own economy....  Imagine a conservative making such a statement.    Krugman - And that's what he was doing last week. Not long ago Washington was talking about Malaysia as an important partner in the war on terror. Now Mr. Mahathir thinks that to cover his domestic flank, he must insert hateful words into a speech mainly about Muslim reform. That tells you, more accurately than any poll, just how strong the rising tide of anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism among Muslims in Southeast Asia has become. Thanks to its war in Iraq and its unconditional support for Ariel Sharon, Washington has squandered post-9/11 sympathy and brought relations with the Muslim world to a new low.  Me - Ahah!  Mahathir was FORCED into his hateful remarks because of the policies of George W. Bush.  You know what?  Screw the relations with the Muslim world.  Weve been trying for a generation to appease and make friends, and what does it get us?  You do not negotiate with people whose world view requires your death.  You confront them, change them, and bring Muslims to power with whom you CAN negotiate with.  There is nothing we can do to make the Muslim world trust us, AS IT IS TODAY.  Again, our actions in Iraq are even more correct, since this is the first effort to allow the peaceful Muslims a chance to have a voice.    And finally...  Krugman -  And bear in mind that Mr. Mahathir's remarks were written before the world learned about the views of Lt. Gen. William "My God Is Bigger Than Yours" Boykin. By making it clear that he sees nothing wrong with giving an important post in the war on terror to someone who believes, and says openly, that Allah is a false idol — General Boykin denies that's what he meant, but his denial was implausible even by current standards — Donald Rumsfeld has gone a long way toward confirming the Muslim world's worst fears.  Me - I don't care what this General believes, provided he gets the job done.  I don't want to see it become a Christian versus Muslim war, but what are we going to do?  Must we have only atheists or Muslims in our armed forces prosecuting this war?  The job right now is to kill hostile Muslims.  If the man pulling the trigger believes he is doing the work of Jesus, I don't care.  So long as he operates within the bounds of his orders and our policy, he can THINK whatever he wants.  The Left LOVES the idea of criminalizing thought (i.e. ridiculous, insane 'hate crime' legislation).  Deeds count, thoughts do not.  If we start placing conditions of thought on the capacity to serve, then we will simply become the US Senate trying to confirm a Judge.  That works well, doesn't it?

       urlLink Yahoo! News - N.Korea Says Ready to Display 'Nuclear Deterrent'   "When an appropriate time comes, the DPRK will take a measure to open its nuclear deterrent to the public as a physical force and then there will be no need to have any more argument," the ministry spokesman said, noting some people doubted the North had nuclear capability."  Indeed. Then we will have to attack them. Or China will. Or we just sit here and let them sell these things to our enemies. Plus they might start demanding things we cannot give, like S. Korea. This is the single greatest threat to the U.S. in the world today, and the media is focusing on the Iraq "quagmire."  "Powell said last week the United States envisaged a public written document, preferably signed by some of North Korea's neighbors, but not the formal non-aggression treaty which Pyongyang has demanded since the crisis erupted a year ago.   North Korea said it was not sure whether the U.S. idea was "a jugglery intended to shirk its responsibility for settling this issue between the DPRK and the U.S. or an artifice to buy time to win the presidential election in 2004."  I like that. "Jugglery." I think it is an attempt to buy us time for Bush to get re-elected. Imagine the public's reaction to the mushroom cloud on CNN? Is it hooror or apathy? Do we comprehend what a renegade state like North Korea can do with this weapon? We can trust China, Russia, Britain, even France with this most powerful of all weapons, but to do so with North Korea would be the gravest mistake.  As Todd said first, they must test. At that moment everything changes and there is no going back. I have to wonder if they really want to change the world like this. They haven't been attacked without the bomb, so why do they need it other than as an offensive weapon?  I hope for a peaceful resolution to this crisis, but I think this is the legacy of our failure to complete the Korean War. It was a flase peace, since their was no defeat of the enemy. Then we would have had to use the bomb to defeat China and Russia, North Korea's then allies. Now they need the bomb to defeat us, South Korea's ally. The more things change the more they stay the same.

       urlLink Bewitched, Bothered, Billy-Goated   DOWD!  I love the new Bush strategy of compeltely bypassing the media and trying to go directly to the American people about the good things that are happening in Iraq.  Assuredly this will not sit well with the established media.  DOWD: The P.R. campaign shamelessly included bogus cheerful form letters sent to newspapers, supposedly written by soldiers in Iraq. It also entailed sweetening up the official Web site of the United States Central Command. Until recently, the site offered a mix of upbeat stories and accounts of casualties and setbacks. Now it's a litany of smiley postings, like "Soldiers host orphans in Mosul" and "Ninevah Province schools benefit from seized Iraqi assets." You have to go to a different page for casualty reports.  Mr. Bush said in interviews that he wanted to "go over the heads of the filter and speak directly with the people" because there was a "sense that people in America aren't getting the truth."  He is right that there has been a filter that has made it hard for Americans — and even Congress — to get the truth on Iraq, but it isn't the press. It's an administration that comically thinks when it hauls out Dick Cheney to say in his condescending high school principal voice that 2 + 2 = 5, we'll buy it.  Me:  Have we talked about this 'bogus letter writing' scheme?  There have been several interviews on Fox News with soldiers on the ground, and many express anger at the way Iraq is being covered.  To a man, they talk about the good things that are hapenning, and can't understand the vitriol in the media.    So a commanding officer wrote a sample letter as a template, and encouraged his men to write their own letters to their home time papers, in an attempt to get the word out.  Not surprisingly, some troops sent the template intact, nary changing a word.  I suppose I can't blame them, but if you are angry enough to want to speak but lack the confidence to write a letter, then this is an easy way to get your word out.  I can only blame them for being lazy.  But the media sees it as another scandal.  A sign of Pentagon propoganda.  Funny how an attempt to get the truth out is propoganda.  DOWD is a shrill, pathetic wreck of a human being.  Like I expressed yesterday in frustration: what would they have us do?  Leave Iraq?  Let the French take over?  Or should we let Dennis Kucinich take it from here?  Did you get this quote from Kucinich?  "I am running for president of the United States to enable the goddess of peace to encircle within her arms all the children of this country and all the children of the world."  I believe Don is from Cleveland, and Mark lives just outside of Cleveland.  Can you two explain why Cleveland keeps electing this guy?

      This is from the internal Pfizer news site.     An interesting exchange took place during the Democratic Presidential debate on Oct. 9, in which a questioner noted the help she has received from Pfizer in affording her prescription drugs, a point missed by a group of U.S. Democratic presidential candidates.   PHOENIX — The U.S. Democratic Party's presidential candidates met for their fourth debate here Thursday night. While attacks on the newest entry, retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, won the most media attention, there was also an interesting exchange on the prescription drug issue.  In the segment of the program where audience members were allowed to ask questions, a stroke patient on a fixed income asked Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina what he would do about prescription drug costs for seniors.  Edwards asked the woman how much she spent per month on prescription medicines. Her answer was illuminating:  "I went on a Pfizer program, and that's why I can do it, I can afford it now....(it's) $51 that I pay. Before that it was 400 and some dollars a month."  Edwards, and other Democrats, missed the point that the woman's monthly prescription drug costs had declined more than 80 percent thanks to a Pfizer-sponsored program. Instead, Edwards slammed pharmaceutical companies, scoring them for alleged "price-gouging," "abusing the system," and being "monopolistic."

       urlLink Genetically Modified Food and the Poor   This gave me quite the laugh. As you may know, silly foreigners don't like enhanced food. Crops that need fewer pesticides, grow faster, taste better, etc. are undesirable to them. The European Union has banned what pundits call "frankenfood" after the patchwork monster of Dr. Frankenstein.  They have some strange belief that such food is harmful in some nebulous fashion. THis is like saying broccoli is poisonous because it is a hybrid vegetable. I see no reason not to improve on existing plants, and animals for that matter. This is no different than breeding, which we have done since the dawn of time.   This raises an issue I would love to hear others talk more about. Namely, engineering our children. The only arguments against this are all emotional. Not that an emotional argument can't be compelling, but I would like to hear a reasonable, logic reason why I shouldn't be allowed to endow my progeny with the best possible set of characteristics. Why should I allow mutation and chance to dictate their future? Why isn't my planned, methodical choice better than some random one?   Back to crops. The truth of why these foreigners don't want our superior produce is simple, and the NYT amazingly says it.  "It makes cotton cheaper to grow for highly subsidized American producers, further undercutting the price of cotton and forcing West African producers out of business."  Well, sort of. As usual I can't quote a single sentance of the NYT without correcting something. The thing forcing these losers out of business is that their product is inferior and too expensive. If it was superior they would find a market, and if it was cheaper the market would find them. Is Japan depriving hard-working Africans of work because they make superior CD players? The fact is that agriculture is best done in huge super-farms. economy of scale finds its perfect application in farming.  "African farmers work tiny plots without the benefit of fertilizers, irrigation or pesticides. The risks they face from genetic modification are remote — but unlike Europeans, the average African would benefit hugely from crops engineered to resist bugs or need little water."  Aw, too bad. Let them pay for the research and development, or even for the licenses! But that of course would be only just. The Left doesn't want justice, but equality. And artificial equality is known as slavery.  "(T)he major companies like Monsanto, Dupont and Syngenta have no financial interest in developing them for African crops — and tightly control the technology."  Why develop a product for illiterate peasants? Let them make something of value and suddenly they will no longer need to farm for a living.  "Several poor nations are trying to develop improved versions of local crops, but these efforts have been crippled by the biotech companies' control over the technology."  So the crime of not giving away the results of expensive research keeps these poor countries from making better crops? Why am I not concerned? This is like saying the tight control over stealth technology keeps India from developing a stealth fighter like ours. It took much labor and treasure to come up with these technologies, and we are right to protect them. If we didn't, there would be no reason to push for new innovations. Why bother when some dirt-farmer in the Ivory Coast can lay claim to your labor for free?  This bit of class warfare rhetoric sums it up:  "The world shouldn't ban genetically modified food. It should develop a cassava root resistant to the mealy bug and drought-proof corn. Antiglobalization activists are right that corporate greed is the problem. But they are wrong that genetically modified crops should be banned. The real crime of genetic modification is not its risks but that it is squandering its promise, widening the gap between rich and poor."  OK, let "the world" do all the research then. That is fine by me. But don't come to us and demand we surrender our wealth. Create your own!

The SUV is itself a killer. The driver of the SUV is not to blame, just the evil SUV. And almost all the stories mention the SUV's make and model.   The reason this is both funny and alarming is that the media elities think that SUV's are a problem, and are a source of injustice in this world. They cause accidents, kill people, use too much gas, cost too much, etc. So when an accident or crime features an SUV, it must be the SUV's fault, at least in part.  Here is a superb example of how the SUV is the culprit:   urlLink Palo Alto probes alleged assault by SUV   El Rushbo says it better:   urlLink Rush Limbaugh on SUVs

       urlLink Rush Limbaugh Statement on Prescription Pain Medication Stories   I have to weigh in on this. I agree completely with Rush and the way he has handled this. Addiction to pain medication is very real and an extremely easy trap to fall into. I think that Rush isn't addicted to booze or cigarettes or many of the more common vices because he refuses to submit to them. But pain medication quickly becomes essential to one's well-being. It's similar to heroin in its building of somatic dependance.  I don't feel anger or really much of anything but sympathy towards Rush for his problem. I don't despise him for it, nor do I find his struggle with it to be noble. I am very glad to hear him say "I take full responsibility for the problem." This may be in fact one of the reasons he resigned from ESPN. Maybe now he can do what must be done in peace. I wish him the best of luck.  On the toher hand, I will despise him if he turned to illegal means to fuel his addiction. Let's face it, he should have had no problem in getting painkillers perscribed. To use his housekeeper is just plain stupid and seems inconsistent with his behavior. I certainly hope that once the truth comes out that "the stories you have read and heard contain inaccuracies and distortions, which I will clear up when I am free to speak about them."

       urlLink Rush Limbaugh Statement on Prescription Pain Medication Stories   Well, here we are.  I'm going to refrain from comment right now since I am rather upset about it.  Like I had said in earlier posts, I think I can look past the addiction, but I am reserving judgment on the charges of trafficking until I know more.  Either way, I'll never look at him the same.

      More comment on the Luxury Boondoggle.  The Left sees any tax cut as somehow making a burden on the taxpayers. Strange, I know. You have to remember always that to the Left, nothing new is ever created. There are only finite resources. Everyone must share as nothing new ever comes into being. So the evil SUV owners are somehow costing the rest of us! Yes, their purchase of an SUV hurts us all. The people who built it, those that maintain it, the gas stations, the state and local governments who tax it, and countless others who profit from the Evil SUV are never considered.   This snippet of insanity from the NYT article illustrates the anti-capitalism mentality:  "(T)ax-bill writers in the Senate are trying to curtail a notorious "business" write-off of tens of thousands of dollars on the cost of an oversized sports utility vehicle, a gilded loophole the affluent have been driving behemoth Hummers and Cadillacs and Lincolns through at taxpayers' expense. "  See, not having to pay exhorbitant taxes on property is somehow costing the taxpayers!  "S.U.V. dealers lost no time in seizing on this selling point, even including the tax write-off possibilities in ads as that ultraluxury extra. Buyers are lured by deductions of up to $100,000 of the cost if they are bold enough to claim full-time business use of an S.U.V.; a 50 percent business claim can net a $50,000 write-off."  The system works! Reward spending and see it come! Why isn't it good to encourage everyone to buy SUV's? They are superior vehicles, and their purchase fuels the economy in countless ways. The SUV represents America at its finest, and that's why the Left hates it so. It is strong, rugged, capable, imposing, and useful. What's not to like? The cost of fuel is an issue, but not really a concern, as market supply will meet market demand if interference is removed.   " Under a move afoot in the Senate Finance Committee, the maximum would be cut back to $25,000, which would cover a farm truck or construction-site vehicle. Proponents figure that this would reclaim $130 million a year in revenues that are now lost through subsidizing an outlet for highway hubris."  I love it! "Reclaim" is the new word for a tax hike. They need to "reclaim" the Bush Tax cut. All your money are belong to U.S.! We (the Gov'ment) will allow you peasants to keep only what you need for a electric car, a HUD house, and lotto tickets. The rest is too much to trust you with! You might spend it on one of those EVIL SUV's!

       urlLink Retool, but Hold Firm to Standards   More Times insanity.  I had to read this one three times until it made sense, and it still doesn't.  Not really.  It seems they think the NY education system is just terrific, despite a failing record.  Watch how the Times invokes the old mantra of money and the sanctity of teachers to escape the accountability that is sorely needed.  Times: A plan to raise the passing score to 65 for some exams this year has been put on hold while the Regents figure out how to prepare students better in the poorest parts of the state for the stiffer requirement.  Me:  RAISING the passing score to 65?  You might be surprised to know it is 55 right now.  Any of you ever pass a test with a 55?  And it seems the poorest part of the state is once again at risk.  Why is it the 'poor' always score poorly?  Might it be the breakdown of the family?  Might it be a culture of failure?  No!  It is the lack of money in the school!    Times: Another problem was highlighted this summer, when 63 percent of students statewide — including thousands of seniors — failed the math test. The Regents appointed a special investigatory panel, whose report has just come out. The report recommended a new, better-calibrated math test, but uncovered several other problems as well.   Me: 'better-calibrated' math tests.  Do I have to spell out what that means?    Times: The panel said New York's math standards needed to be clarified so teachers could be certain of what students needed to know. The report also returned to a familiar but thorny subject, noting that many math teachers needed specific kinds of training to help students meet math standards that are widely seen as the most rigorous in the nation.   Me:  So our brilliant teachers, loyaly paying their union dues, must be instructed by others about what students must know?  And these teachers need training to meet 'rigorous math standards'?  Has anyone seen a High School math book lately?  Tell me that is rigorous.    Times: Evidence shows that success on rigorous tests can be increased when states provide teachers who show students the way.   Me:  Teachers are going to show students the way!?  But you just said they don't even know the way!  You know what else evidence shows?  Home schooled students crush state schooled students 100% of the time.  I guess the parents can provide good teachers, where the state fails.  But the Teacher's Union is trying to enact law to require home schoolers to have 'certified' teachers.  They want to shut it all down, since it is so obviously illustrated their failure.  So the Times concludes: the system is failing, but we simply need to retool it with more money.  I think they've pretty much said that about every anti-poverty program since the New Deal.

       urlLink The Luxury All-Terrain Boondoggle   The Times just keeps hammering them out of the Sanity Park today.    The evil Bush Tax Cuts expanded a break that allows luxury SUVs to be taxed at lower rates.  The Times goes insane.  It seems that they don't like it when the auto industry receives a boon, since this makes the big ticket high-profit SUV sell better.  No, the Times is jsut angry at the affluence of the SUV buyer.  They refer to 'chrome-plated' affluence, 'ultraluxury', and my favorite - 'highway hubris'.  So if you drive an SUV, you are engaging in 'overbearing pride and arrogance' according to the definition on Dictionary.com.  The Times just hates it when people spend money on thier own initiative.  I guess we should let the Times select our vehicles for us.

       urlLink The U.N.'s Better Idea on Iraq   The New York Times launches into the ‘We must go to the UN’ argument again this morning.  I still don’t understand the magic of ‘multilaterilism’ when it comes at the expense of getting the job done.  Iraq has a long way to go, but do we really want a bunch of nations involved who have already proven they don’t share our concerns?  Do we want the French crawling around in there when they’ve already aided and abetted Saddam in obtaining prohibited weapons, sold him technology, and hid evidence of atrocities?    Times: . When Secretary of State Colin Powell circulates a Security Council resolution, he wants other countries to endorse its main provisions, and to understand that the White House allows him to negotiate only over secondary details, not matters of substance. In the administration's oddly inverted logic, when this does not happen, as is now the case, it is the U.N. that is failing the test of multilateralism by not rallying around America's nonnegotiable positions. As a senior administration official put it to The Times this week, "They can be multilateral and be part of it, or they can tell us to do it ourselves."  Me:  Yes, this is exactly the case.  If the world does not rally around our stated purpose, then there can be no multilateralism.  If we drop our principle for the sake of an agreement, then what can be accomplished by that agreement?  Why should we sacrifice the mission for the sake of a coalition?  This is the type of thing that hurt us at the end of Gulf War I.  Again, the warm fuzzy glow of world unity is not worth pursuing at the cost of hard principle.  Times: Prolonging unilateral American rule serves no obvious security purpose and guarantees that the United States will remain the primary target of postwar Iraqi resentments.   Me: Excuse me, but I think the security purpose served is quite obvious.  We have not yet finished locating WMD, and there is still a lot of intelligence about terror to be sifted from the remains of Saddam’s regime.  Part of this process is having the muscle in place to follow up on informant tips and to be there to preserve the evidence.  Again, do we want hostile nations such as the French running around and stumbling upon the weapons they sold to Iraq?  As for being the primary target, I guess the Times won’t be all that concerned if Polish troops are getting killed one by one.  Is that what they mean?  Times: The administration's wrong-headed insistence on maintaining exclusive control over Iraq has already proved costly. Attacks against American troops, international aid workers and Iraqi police recruits continue at an alarming rate. Separate incidents in and near Baghdad yesterday killed at least 10 people and injured more than 40.  Me: In 2002, there were 1,842 murders in California, or about 5 per day.  I guess we should send the UN into LA and SF.  The Left loves to beat this drum everyday, pointing out the steady drip of deaths.  Each one is indeed a terrible thing, but we have to maintain perspective.  42 people are murdered every day in the US, and while our population is quite a bit bigger, I think the media should spend at least a month reporting every single one of them, just to put it in perspective.

       urlLink Lessons in Civility   Krugman again.  Tossing out the same old ideas about Bush (fiscal devestation, hyped WMD claims blah blah blah).  Just one quote worth noting:  Krugman: On the foreign policy front, this administration hyped the threat from Iraq, ignoring warnings from military professionals that a prolonged postwar occupation would tie down much of our Army and undermine our military readiness. (Joseph Galloway, co-author of "We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young," says that "we have perhaps the finest Army in history," but that "Donald H. Rumsfeld and his civilian aides have done just about everything they could to destroy that Army.")   Me:  We Were Soldiers was authored by two men.  General Hal Moore who commanded the troops in that battle, and Joe Galloway, a combat reported who flew into the battle zone after it had all started.  Funny how in Krugman's mind, the reporter's comments on the state of the Army are somehow authoritive because he sat on the General's knee and helped him craft the story into a nice piece of writing.  How about getting a real military man's comments?  What does Moore have to say about 'Rummy'?

       urlLink California's Day After: Governor Schwarzenegger   The vitriol! Quite petty of the NYT, the "Newspaper of Record," to try to take cheap shots at Governor-Elect Schwarzenegger. Though I agree with both Todd and George Will that the recall is a bad thing, it is the law and Arnold won fair and square.  This editorial makes the CA Republican Party out to be the bad guys, since if they offered more leftists as candidates the state might not be in such a mess. Say what? So they needed to be Democrats so the Democrats couldn't run the state into the ground in just 5 short years? Here's a quote:  "California's system is actually the worst of all evils. The voters micromanage the state budget through one referendum after another. But they are generally deprived of real choice in picking state officials. Right-wing Republicans have been able to control their party's nominating process, forcing a moderate-to-liberal populace to accept whatever slate the Democrats deign to offer. Mr. Schwarzenegger, a moderate-to-liberal Republican, would have had a much tougher time in a primary than he did in this race, where he was able to insert himself onto the ballot without the party's screening."  I believe it was the state Republican Party that allowed Arnold to run. In fact they have been after him to run for years now. Since he is not a politician and is basically unqualified to be the chief exectutive of a state, the recall was his big chance. I suppose the Republicans sacrificed their principles to get their guy into office. McClintock would of course been better, and perhaps would have done the slash and burn the state needs.  A little nugget of love from the NYT:  "During the campaign, Mr. Schwarzenegger had a huge advantage in the low expectations that everyone had about him. In politics, it is better to be lucky than to be good. But Mr. Schwarzenegger already knew that from his movie days."  Low expectations? Like being able to fix the problems of the state without being beholden to campaign contributors for election? How about for bringing some common values to the Governorship? True, Arnold is pretty far left on social issues, but he is a good representative of what "conservatives" are like in California. The voters connected with him and his pledge to fix the state's problems. Davis and Bustamente offered nothing but more of the same.   It might be too optimistic to think the voters of California have seen the error of allowing leftist radicals to run their state. The true test will be in the next general election. If they recall the Democrats in the state legislature then I will believe that intelligence and reason has returned to the Golden State.

       urlLink Is Condi Gaslighting Rummy?   This day's DOWDism focuses on the supposed rift in the President's administration. It would seem to the Rabid Left that this transfer of power from the Dept. of Defense to the National Security Adviser's Office is some sort of evidence of in-fighting.   DOWD has always been contemptuous of Donald Rumsfeld. She calls him "Rummy" all the time and a "fossil." So this transfer of authority must seem to her to be a vindication of her dream that Rumsfeld is incompetant and that the Iraq situation is a... quagmire. Nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, this transfer is obviously a positive sign. When the war is won, the military loses control. Occupation forces are placed under civilian authority, since there is no more enemy army to be vanquished. This is a show of confidence and strength by the Bush administration. They are saying the situation is peaceful and secure enough that Pentagon control is no longer necessary. No doubt Condolezza Rice's new authority will eb shared with military commanders on the ground over in Iraq, but she is now entrusted with rebuilding the country.  I refer you now to the mad ravings of the DOWD:  "The administration that never let you see it sweat is sweating, as two of its control freaks openly tug over control. The president's foreign policy duenna and his grumpy grampy over at the Pentagon are suddenly mud wrestling.  Women who are discouraged at the ascension of Conan the Barbarian in Cal-ee-fornia can take heart. In this delicious gender-bender, Condoleezza Rice triumphs as the macho infighter, driving Rummy into a diva-like meltdown. "  What is the evidence of any power struggle? I bet Rumsfeld is glad to be relieved of some of the Iraq responsibility. He must have other pressing concerns, like the War on Terror. Iran, Syria, and North Korea are now more important military concerns than some rag-tag guerillas in Iraq. Those terrorists can't threaten us as a nation by ambushing GI's in Iraq. But a nuclear North Korea is a threat to the entire world. It is better to have the Pentagon focus on bigger fish than some Saddam loyalists and Muslim extremists.  Perhaps Rumsfeld wasn't consulted on this shift. But is that really important? Is Rumsfeld so small that this transfer would cause a problem? I doubt it.   This rant by DOWD and others in the media shows their distrust of the Bush administration and the military on the whole. They refuse to believe that America is a force for good in this world, and that we simply do things better than the UN ever could. It is disgusting to me that these weasels cheapen the efforts of those who protect us and our way of life on a daily basis. I trust Bush's team to do what is right, and to ignore the holow criticism emenating from the liberal media cesspool. They have shown that they get results, and our moral authority is rock-solid.   I really have to write a piece on the goodness of America. It's one of the Fundamental Truths which seperate the leftists from reason.

I've come to believe that FDR was one of the most damaging, destructive presidents we've ever endured.  His explosion of the federal government echoes to this day through social security and the New Deal created the era of entitlement.  He did more to trample the tenth ammendment than any other president.  Not to mention the court packing scheme!  I'm not up to a complete dissection of FDR this morning, but I wanted to at least point out the Sowell column.

Prop 54 would have banned the government from being able to collect data about race.  It would have been illegal to ask you that question on any government related document.  Sadly, it failed.    The funniest quote in the article is from Cruz Bustamante.    "Californians rejected Prop. 54 because they believe that discrimination is wrong in California. We must create a colorblind society, but we can't do that by putting blinders on government."   So to ignore color, we must observe color?  There was another interesting item I saw on the election returns, and it meshes with the race issue.  On the question of drivers licenses for illegal aliens, 73% of whites thought it was a bad idea, while only 7% of blacks and 17% of Hispanics thought the same way.  Racially, we all might as well be living on separate planets.  I can't understand this disparity, when the issue seems so obviously wrong.  But I'm just a white male.

      The recall.  I was watching Brit Hume on Fox last night at around 11 PM when they called the race for Ahnuld.  A little later, he had on Bob Mulholland, the chief Democratic man behind Davis.  Mulholland is the guy who brought us the scorched earth politics of Davis, and is widely reviled as a mean, bitter man.  He was in rare form last night after they conceded defeat.  Petulant, angry, bitter and so on.  I'm looking for a transcript, but it isn't up yet.  I'll try to paraphrase, and believe it or not, I'm not exaggerating.  Hume asked Bob basically 'what happened?'.  Bob went on a tear about how the Voters are going to get what they deserve for turning out a fine governor, and Davis was merely at the wrong place at the wrong time.  Bob said that any governor in this situation, mired in the Bush economy and fighting with Enron, would have been recalled.    Hume then asked if Bob was saying the the Davis record had anything to do with being recalled.  Bob smirked and said absolutely not.  Gray Davis was a victim of a revolt against Bush.  And Bush should take warning in these results.    Hume then rightly looked confused.  He pointed out that if you add up Ahnuld and McClintock's votes, you get 60% of the electorate.  He asked if getting 60% GOP votes in a state that is largely democratic is somehow to be seen as a dire warning for Bush?  Bob said absolutely.  These results demonstrated that California is angry with Bush, and Bush better create some jobs fast or he will be finished.  Oh, I should point out that through the whole thing, Bob referred to Bush Junior.  Finally, Hume asked, "Who is Bush Junior, sir?"  Bob replied, "The man who occupies the White House."  Note - occupies.  Not elected.  He then went on to say that during the first Bush presidency, GWB was widely called Bush Junior.  Hume responded that he covered that White House and never heard such a thing, then moved on.  It was a nice moment when a journalist came close to calling a hack a pinhead.  Bob went on to say that if Ahnuld has not repaired the state within 100 days, they were going to mount a recall to remove this illegitimate governor.  He said that 100 days was being generous, in light of how they were unjustly recalled themselves.  That's about all I can recall.  I really hope Fox puts up a video clip or at least a transcript.  This was priceless TV.

       urlLink When Prudery Kills   Kristof has been travelling Africa lately, lamenting Bush's murderous AIDS policy toward that nation.  I don't understand the premise of the column.  Kristof: "They've been in office three years, and they've done almost nothing to get the sick and dying on treatment," said Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist and expert on public health. "Despite a lot of talk and one famous speech, and one plan that isn't in operation, they've essentially accomplished nothing."  "It's utterly inexcusable," Mr. Sachs added, "that 7.5 million people in Africa have died on their watch, and they've not yet reached even 500 Africans on treatment in U.S.A.I.D.-supported programs. They've talked and procrastinated and dissembled while millions of impoverished people have died. Ultimately, history will judge them very severely."  Me:  When did Africa become part of the United States?  We have no obligation to pour money into this issue.  Every single dollar we put there is true charity, not an obligation.  Moreover, AIDS is largely a preventable disease based upon behavior.  To say that we are responsible for these deaths is once again removing the element of personal responsiblity of those contracting the disease.  Now if it were malaria or some other plague that comes along through little fault of the victim, I could see an argument that we should be doing more if we had the power.  But when people insist on engaging in activity that kills them, why are we obligated?  It would be as if the entire continent was smoking themselves to death, and people demanding that we flood the land with nicotine patches.    Kristof: The administration is also fumbling the AIDS initiative by requiring that one-third of AIDS prevention funds do nothing but encourage sexual abstinence until marriage. This is the kind of stipulation set by people who sit in Washington and have never actually set foot in an African village.  Me:  And what is wrong with abstinence?  As Rush likes to say ( I think Bill Bennet said it originally), abstinence works every time it is tried.  Or is it somehow unreasonable to expect Africans to have the strength and will to avoid deadly behavior?  This smacks of racism to me, the same sort of racism that says Iraqis just aren't able to handle freedom.  Or during our own AIDS crises, when defenders of gays said that gays just can't stop having sex.  Why are the defenders of groups always willing to lower the expectations for that group?  Bah!

Hitting "rock bottom" is a clinical term for a reason.  I can see what you are thinking, if you had his life, you wouldn't let anything screw it up, but you are making two incorrect assumptions.  1.) You are projecting your perspective into your imagination of his life.  For Rush, the risk of an addiction is as great as your current risk of addiction. He loses his job, destroys his family and hits "rock bottom", albeit in the public eye (something he is used to anyway so that can be argued as no additional risk).  It doesn't matter that he is a talk show host and you are a QA engineer, the relative risks are the same/  2.) An addict, by the nature of addiction, cannot recognize the addiction while involved with it.  99% of the time, no matter what the addiction or who is addicted, it takes some large scale event or tradegy (rock bottom) to even be able to realize that there is a problem.  Making a move to get help is entirely another step that can be just as difficult as recognizing the problem.  The only time I have heard of someone taking a pre-emptive addiction counselling step is Ben Affleck for alcohol, which is hoopla cause he still "socially" drinks, can you smell publicity?  I know I am running dangerously close to liberal grounds by taking responsibility away from the individual in correcting their own problems, but I am just being realistic about the nature and proven physiology of an addiction.  It's easy for non-addicts to say you should have gotten help, but that is just ignorance towards the nature of the human mind and addiction.  On the other hand, when you recognize the problem, seek help and receive treatment, then, in my mind, you have the responsibility of staying clean and sober and falling back off the wagon is in-excusable, that's the point that I combine the liberal and conservative views in my thinking.  Sorry to sound like I am jumping on you, I just have seen this kind of stuff up front (not just from our family) and it has modified my thoughts on addiction.   End E-mail.  No, you aren't jumping on me.  This is a good discussion.    I should also note that my loss of respect is hypothetical at this point.  Much will depend on the truth when we know it.  I guess I simply lack an understanding of addiction.  I assume rationality, but addiction is by nature irrational.  Perhaps that is the root of my problem here.  I can't understand destroying yourself, especially when there is much to loose.    So perhaps my assessment is unfair.  I am willing to re-examine my thoughts about Rush's possible problem.  My lack of experience with it makes for difficult understanding.  However, in Rush's position, I think he bears a greater responsibility due to his position and stated opinions on his show.  It seems consistent to expect a man who spends much of his time promoting responsibility and leadership to recognize a problem within himself.  If he was a mere NFL commentator, then I could see the addiction getting out of hand since it isn't on the radar everyday.    Like Matthew Perry from Friends.  If the Chandler character is on every show going on about AA and drug recovery, yet the actor is drinking himself blind or popping pain meds (which happened), I would expect some sort of light to go on in his head.  Those circumstances seem contrary.  But since Chandler is just a funny man, the addiction is simply a bad thing that happened to an actor, and I'll keep watching the show and laughing at him.    With Rush, I can't help but feel that this shouldn't have happened.  Or at least he should have got some help (again, that's probably my problem right there...expecting him to recognize the problem).  Bah, I'm getting tangled up here trying to express my concern.  Leave it at this - I simply feel betrayed.  I want it to be false, and if it is true, I want him to get better.  But ultimately, his credibility will always be damaged on issues of responsibility and conduct.    Am I too harsh?  Perhaps.  The only addict I knew is dead by his own hand.  I lack a lot of experience with the problem, and most of what I do know is in retrospect, after he was gone.  I am angry about that.  Not that it matters, but he dissapointed me as I discovered more of what was going on.    But I have not been addicted or witnessed it first hand, so perhaps my anger is misplaced.  I can concede that.    My personal nature can best be described as compulsive.  When I find something I enjoy, I tend to go full-bore and squeeze the life out of it, driving all those around me crazy with my obsession.  Perhaps that is a similar thing to addiction.  I don't know.  But I can't imagine taking something I am obsessed about and destroying my life and family in order to persue it.  There are limits.  I'm just trying to describe my blind spot here.  I'm not denying that addiction is a powerful force.  But Rush is like Caesar, he must be beyond reproach because of the role he has assumed.    Okay, chime in.  I don't mind kicking this around.  And don't worry about blasting me.

       urlLink Lumps of Labor   Paul Krugman have me a bit of a struggle this morning.  I actually agree with some of the things he has said, but of course, we arrive at inevitably opposite conclusions.  It struck me in reading, that Krugman, like many on the Left, believe that the best way to get money into circulation is to have the government spend it.  I want money to circulate as well, but I want the people to spend it on themselves.  This is the crux of the economic difference between the two parties, and I think it illustrates why Command and Control approaches favored by the Left always fail.  They believe that money has to be spent, but moreover, money has to be directed in endeavors that enhance societal benefit.  Therefore, they favor confiscation from the individual, and spending by the government in directed plans.  These plans are supposed to enhance job creation by directing labor towards projects that benefit society.  They reason that this money will make its way back to the people through government spending and job growth.  So it is good for you to pay high taxes, since those taxes will assure you a steady job and social benefits.  I believe that 'societal guidance' is a load of crap, to put it inelegantly.  The economy is too vast to be directed, and the will of the majority is expressed through the billions of daily transactions of each person. While the Left may not like SUVs, there is still a high demand for the product.  It is a winning product that creates jobs and profits.  In a Command and Control economy, it would be up to DC to select which products will succeed, and how often does the Government get things right?  Money needs to be spent, so leave it in the hands of the people to spend.  Money is directed more efficiently when the spender receives a direct benefit from the expense.  Under a tax system, you still spend, but the money is spent on government, and then they decide where it goes.  I hope that's clear.  I know it isn't a big revelation, but when I find myself agreeing with Krugman on some economic issues, it scared me.  As I looked deeper, this difference rose to the surface, and I took comfort in the fact that it is the same fundamental difference I've had for ages.    Still, Krugman uses the occasion to bash Bush and his policies.  Back to the Command and Control model....policies don't create jobs.  The best that policies can hope to do is to remove the barriers to job creation.  The Left sees a job as something that must be created.  They don't believe that jobs spring forth from the desire of individuals to improve lives.  All you need to make a job is the will to work, and the gumption to apply yourself in an activity that provides value to your fellow man.  That is all.  Jobs WANT to be created.  The Right believes that jobs are restrained from creation by aritificial circumstances.  Taxes, regulation, laws.  In our view, Jobs are the natural condition, and need not be artificially encouraged.  A fundamental difference of opinion.  It is why we favor low taxes for business, and the freedom to let the market set wages and conditions.  Conversely, the left has a hostile view of the job creation element of the marketplace.  They feel it must be coerced to create jobs, and the businesses are by nature exploitive.  Just my two cents.

      Don, I hope you don't mind me posting this, but after this email, I think I need to clear up exactly what I was saying.  I'm also very happy to hear that you are getting your life together.    Email starts -   not sure if I understand your position on Rush's alleged addition. You say  How could he do something so stupid. What are you talking about. His  addiction, petty drug dealing or his brazen behavior. As of late I am  becoming a bit of an expert on addiction and recovery. I have a problem with  alcohol. It's cost me a lot. It's taken me 15 years to figure that out.  If  Rush is an addict(he kicked smokes) it may take him something like this to  say "Hey I have a drug problem" An addict does not realize they are addicts.  The thought process is fucked up. All we care about is when, where and how.  He chose pain killers. I don't know the whole story but if he is truly  addicted then he needs help and lets hope he gets it. Step one is a tuff  step to take. We admit we are powerless over "drug of choice"and that our  lives had become unmanageable. I've admitted it but I have not accepted it.  I've got 11.5 steps to go. If true, you can see the unmanageable part of his  life, illegal acts. Whether it be alcohol, cocaine, heroin, sex, Rx drugs or  gambling it's a disease. If you don't believe that get hooked and try to get  off. Don't let the bad truth shatter your connection with him. We are only  human,(unless you believe the aquatic ape theory) we are hypocrites, we have  faults, as long as we are willing to make amends to those we have harmed  then we're moving in the right direction. Shit Robert Downy Jr. was given  the poor little rich Hollywood actor bit(media treatment) can't we somehow  make that defense fit for Rush. Poor formally huge right wing conservative talk radio show host awful tie  wearing NFL analyst with formally nicotine stained fingers Snapple drinking  Spatula city ad man. Ya think that will work.  End Email  My potential anger with Rush comes from the stupidity of his actions (assuming that he has done what the allegations claim - notably: purchasing drugs from street thugs, buying thousands of pills at a time, relying on a housekeeper as a supplier and so on.)  Someone of his profile simply cannot engage in this kind of behaivor and expect to not get caught.  People talk, especially low life dealers when they get caught.  Now, that isn't to say I condone the addiction so long as he is careful about his supply.  I can understand an addiction, and I don't know how the man suffered during his cochlear implant.  I've read that it can be an excruciating thing to go through.  Pain Killer addiction is somewhat easy to get tangled up in, from what I've read.  It bothers me, if true, that Rush did not seek help immediately.  He has it all.  A dream life, success, and a job he loves.  And he has placed it at risk, when help was a phone call away.  If he found himself hooked, all he had to do was call his doctor, take a medical leave, and then come back and tell us about his exercise in personal responsibility.    I am saddened when someone I admire becomes addicted, but I don't get angry unless that individual recognizes a problem and makes no effort to get help.    So I guess that is the root of my possible trouble with Rush.  I've never been addicted, so maybe I don't understand.  All I would hope for is that he gets himself fixed up if he has a problem.  If he got involved in a criminal enterprise, then I am going to have a harder time getting over it.

      Yesterday's Best of the Web caught up to the quote supplied by Don Barda.  The New York Post's Jonathan Foreman visited MoveOn.org's anti-Schwarzenegger rally Friday and offers a quote that pretty much sums it up:    *** QUOTE ***    The most honest thing I heard came from film producer and Codepink activist Patricia Foulkrod. She admitted that Bill Clinton's sexual peccadilloes were as inexcusable as Arnold's. "The difference is that Clinton was so brilliant," she said. "If Arnold was a brilliant pol and had this thing about inappropriate behavior, we'd figure a way of getting around it. I think it's to our detriment to go on too much about the groping. But it's our way in. This is really about the GOP trying to take California in 2004 and our trying to stop it."    *** END QUOTE ***

       urlLink OpinionJournal - Featured Article   The Wall Street Journal speaks about the Rush Drug story.  I haven't said much about this myself since there hasn't been any news about it.  At first, it was the National Inquirer, which seemed sordid and typical of a rag like that.  Then there was a New York Post story, claiming independent confirmation from the Palm Beach DA.  That is more convincing.  Rush himself mentioned it only briefly on his show Friday, and as the Wall Street Journal says, it makes sense for him to restrain comment when facing a legal issue.  Silence is the correct reponse, when there is really nothing forthcoming from a law enforcement agency that warrents a response.  Personally, this story angers me.  I am trying to be patient and not jump to conclusions, but the more I think that Rush might have done something this stupid, the angrier I get at him.  Of course, this story has not, nor likely will it, invalidate the fact that I agree with 90% of everything he has said about politics and the state of the American culture.    However, if there is truth to this, and my worse fears are confirmed (petty drug dealing, addiction, and the arrogance of thought displayed by such brazen behavior), then my future as a fan of Rush is in doubt.  I can forgive him to a point, but I will most likely abandon his show, even if I still agree with his positions.  Twelve years of listening have taught me to trust him.  This is the edge to the problem.  That trust has earned him the time and patience that will allow the truth to come out for me.  That trust is always the element that will shatter my connection to him if it turns out to be a bad truth.  Say it ain't so, Rush....

       urlLink Op-Ed Columnist: Scaring Up Votes   As soon as the GOP started running ads saying that the President is being attacked because he is attacking the terrorists, I couldn't wait for DOWD and company to pop off with a rambling screed.  She has not dissapointed me.  DOWD: Before the president even knows his opponent, his first political ad is blanketing Iowa today.  "It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known," Mr. Bush says, in a State of the Union clip.  Well, that's a comforting message from our commander in chief. Do we really need his cold, clammy hand on our spine at a time when we're already rattled by fresh terror threats at home and abroad? When we're chilled by the metastasizing Al Qaeda, the resurgent Taliban and Baathist thugs armed with deadly booby traps; the countless, nameless terror groups emerging in Turkey, Morocco, Indonesia and elsewhere; the vicious attacks on Americans, Brits, aid workers and their supporters in Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey? The latest illustration of the low-tech ingenuity of Iraqi foes impervious to our latest cascade of high-tech missiles: a hapless, singed donkey that carted rockets to a Baghdad hotel.  Me:  Funny how DOWD and her cronies on the Left have been screaming for some time now that all terror threats were overblown, and we are over-reacting to a phantom of further terror.  Now when it is convenient for them, they can spout a whole list of international threats.  And when Bush reminds us, he is just fearmongering.  DOWD: Richard Clarke, the former U.S. counterterrorism chief, told Ted Koppel that Mr. Bush's habit of putting X's through the pictures of arrested or killed Qaeda managers was very reminiscent of a scene in the movie "The Battle of Algiers," in which the French authorities did the same to the Algerian terrorists: "Unfortunately, after all the known Algerian terrorists were arrested or killed, the French lost. And that could be the thing that's happening here, that even though we're getting all the known Al Qaeda leaders, we're breeding new ones. Ones we don't know about and will be harder to find."  Me: So now we should adopt our foreign policy from a movie about Frenchman?  What??  Further, it is now a bad idea to kill Al Qaeda because then we won't know any of the new leaders that could emerge?  I guess we made a big mistake taking down Germany in WWII, because no one saw that whole Sovet Union thing coming.  We should have left Hitler in power, so we could surround him and watch him closely.  Does DOWD really believe that the number of terrorists is a fixed quantity?  For each that dies, a replacement pops out of the ground?  So if we gather them all in one place and keep them alive, none will ever appear elsewhere?    DOWD: The Bush war left our chief villains operating, revved up the terrorist threat, ravaged our international alliances and sparked the resentment of a world that ached for us after 9/11.  Me: I'm really getting sick of those that pine for the days when we were pitied by the rest of the world.  We appreciate the sympathy, but I do not want the rest of the world's constant pity.  I'd rather stand on our own and take the appropriate action, and if the price is losing this pity, then all the better.  DOWD would rather have warm, runny sympathy over self-sufficiency and the projection of our power in a just cause.  DOWD: James Goodby and Kenneth Weisbrode wrote in The Financial Times last week that the Bush crew has snuffed the optimism of F.D.R., Ronald Reagan and Bush père: "Fear has been used as a basis for curtailing freedom of expression and for questioning legal rights long taken for granted. It has crept into political discourse and been used to discredit patriotic public servants. Ronald Reagan's favorite image, borrowed from an earlier visionary, of America as `a shining city on a hill' has been unnecessarily dimmed by another image: a nation motivated by fear and ready to lash out at any country it defines as the source of a gathering threat."  Me: I believe Reagan's Shinig City was ringed in anti-missile batteries and defended by tough men who could kill you from a thousand miles.  That's part of what made the city great.  In the mind of the Left, a practical realism in national defense cannot co-exist with an optimistic growth-oriented society.  I think that speaks volumes about thier perceptions of the world.  What are the alternatives?  Abandon defense?  Ignore a real threat?  Fear is here, and we do not seek to perpetuate it.  We have embarked upon a bold course; the premise that terror and anarchy are NOT givens, that we do not have to learn to live with a certain level of mayhem.  I don't know if we can bring about such a world, but how can you say it isn't a worthy goal?    The alternative is the constant churn of death and mayhem in most of the world, with the occasional spillover into our civilized society.  For ages, the Right has been guilty of isolationism.  I believe we have finally realized that we must be engaged in the events of the world, and we must use whatever means we command to instill order and peace where ever possible.  That means chosing sides, and acting strongly.  That means identifying evil and acting against it.  Concepts uncomfortable for the moral equivalence crowd on the Angry Left.    We can't get bogged down in recognizing the root cause of barbarism, and trying to understand unspeakable death and destruction in order to address it.  Poverty and hopelessness does not cause terror and death.  The latter cause the former.  We must stop the killing in order to bring the stability and peace that allows capital and prosperity to flow.  The only way to stop killing is to kill the killers.  Another idea that sends the Left under their beds in fear.  Literally, I think we are looking at the most important election in my generation's life.  If Bush is defeated, and we elect an anti-war President, then the terror front will gain a generation of power and life.  The message will be sent: we will not oppose you at the cost of our blood.  We will not engage you in foreign lands.  You have won the right to keep this battleground overseas, and to slaughter and destroy, to stand in the way of progress to preserve your breeding grounds of hate and terror.  The message we will send with a Bush loss cannot be argued.  It is a referendum on our resolve to see this through.  Should we change course, we will have declared our day done, and new powers will rise up within 50 years, supplanting us on the world stage.  And the world will return to a time when murder, war and terror are once again the common means to manage the daily affairs of nations.

       urlLink The Incredible Bloated Money Bill   Holy crap! Check out the metaphor usage:  (T)he Republican-led Congress is wallowing toward a garishly spectacular finale: a $284 billion omnibus spending bill, a haphazardly stitched hulk that gives a bad name to the usual legislative metaphors about sausage-making and bauble-laden Christmas trees. This bill, being rigged as a take-it-or-leave-it voting prod for lawmakers antsy to get home, begins by combining five expensive measures that deserve separate votes because they are vital for financing much of the government next year. But the real political goal is to festoon this appropriations wad with an incongruous mix of resurrected controversies, hometown pork and hot-button proposals.  It is no comfort that there is still a week's bargaining left before the Capitol auction gavel descends. In a resurrection worthy of Transylvania, a nefarious $7.2 billion sweetener for doomed tobacco growers has flapped back to life, its chances uncertain. The real pity, large as the omnibus bill itself, is that the full contents and damages will not be known for weeks, even by the lawmakers who vote for approval. If the old Congressional problem was gridlock, the new one is juggernaut.

       urlLink Ananova - Protesters cheer as Bush effigy is toppled   So they pulled down a statue of Bush, recreating the fall of the Saddam statue in Baghdad.  Time and time again the Angry Left tries to occasionally qualify their protests against Bush by saying "Oh, and Saddam was a bad man", but the statement is sounding increasingly hollow.  Their opposition to Bush becomes inseparably entangled with support for Saddam, and they continue to blur this distinction through their universal refusal to condemn the evidence of mass graves and other atrocities we are finding in Iraq.  By toppling a statue of Bush, as a symbolic gesture of payback, they establish themselves behind the proposition that Saddam should still be in power and he was removed unjustly.  They may deny that, but where are the placards and signs condemning the murders commited by the Saddam regime, or denouncing the recent bombings in Turkey?  Why is it so difficult for the Left to say "We don't agree with the war, but at least some good came out of it."    Their hatred has driven them into the arms of the enemy of civilization.  I wish them a long life, so that they can one day see their errors.

DOWD: Swaddled in the $8.5 million security blanket of reinforced concrete, wire mesh and 14,000 bobbies designed to protect him from the ungrateful citizens of our one — I mean, our closest — ally, Mr. Bush was a blithe spirit in his rented tails with his English cousins behind the high gates of Buckingham Palace.  Me:  Would she rather he walk the street with no protection?  I'm sure if something happened, she would then crow about the naive trust of the administration.  DOWD: Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London, captured the spirit of the moment when he told NPR that the Republican National Committee should foot the bill for Mr. Bush's extraordinary security, the largest police operation ever in Great Britain. All this, he harrumphed, "just so George Bush can use a few clips of him and the queen in his campaign advertisements for re-election next year."  Me:  Ken Livingstone also said that GWB is the greatest threat to all life on the planet we've ever seen, and his policies, if continued, will gaurentee our extermination as a species.  He also commented that he does not recognize Bush since he wasn't elected as President.  Obviously, a noted and stately source of inciteful commentary.  DOWD: There was a dispiriting contrast between G.W.B. shutting out the world and avoiding the British public, and the black-and-white clips this week of J.F.K. reaching out to the world and being adored by Berliners.  Me: I AM SO SICK OF JFK!!  A man most notable for stopping a bullet.  The myth of Camelot and all of that.  The Democrats are stuck in the past, mired in a mirage that never existed.  The truth is that JFK was mostly an ineffective president.  Much of his legislation did not go anywhere, and aside from a few bright moments like the Cuban crises and the handling of Civil Rights, there wasn't much to talk about in such a short reign.  They conveniently ignore the massive corruption of the adminstration.  Am I suppose to get all weepy when I see the Zapruder film, or when I see Conkrite tearing up in that old black and white clip?  I'm sorry, the emotional capital is used up, and the Democrats will be well advised to move on and realize it isn't 1962.

      The future of the Blog.  Honestly, I'm getting worn down by it.  Lately I've been nothing but disgusted by the anti-war critics, and the continued erosion of public poll numbers.  We're losing the war, and no one seems to recall why we are fighting.  We will pull out of Iraq too soon, and it will all revert.  People will ask why we did it, and inside of a year the terror groups will be back.  The whiners will be vindicated, and when the next attack comes, the Bush policies will be blamed.    Already, Afghanistan has released their draft Constitution, calling for an Islamic Republic and the dominance of Islamic Law.  We fought for this?  I'm losing faith in America.  I don't think our people have the strength to do what must be done, meaning that in a short 230 years or so, we have described the same arc as the first thousand years of Rome.  We all know where it ends, it's just a matter of time.  So I'm finding it harder and harder to summon the energy to read the daily ravings from the left, and struggling even more to care enough to respond.  So I might just let this go away.  At the least, I'll probably take a break until something happens to regain my interest.  I appreciate those that do take the time to read it.  Keep checking back.  If my mood changes, I'll begin posting again.  But for now, I don't feel like it is worthwhile.

       urlLink Doubts grow within Israeli Army   Mark sent this on to me yesterday.  It is an interesting article about how fatigue is setting in on the Israeli army as they fight against the Palestinian terror organizations.  I think it points out some fundamental facts that many are probably not going to be comfortable with.  The root of the problem in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lies in the lack of a substantive resolution.  Peace has never be obtained while the root of the conflict remains, which means that one side needs to lose, decisively.  This is not the case in the Middle East.  While the Israeli's have fought several wars against armed agressors, they are always restrained from total victory by a misguided world opinion.  The overt anti-semtism of Europe, along with the indecisive American administrations, have always pulled Israel's leash at the last moment, sparing the Palestinian (or other Arab) leadership from the consequences of thier actions.  Time and time again, Israel has been asked to respect the leadership of a group of people that seek to kill them.  Arafat and his thugs are still in power, and so long as this condition exists, there will be no peace.  The current situation of limited strikes cannot be sustained, and Israel is risking a Vietnamization of thier conflict with the Palestinians.  A limited, political war will always result in failure.  In my mind, the answer to the Israeli problem is unrestricted war upon those that support the destruction of the Israel.  Arafat and his ilk must be removed and/or killed, immediately.  All others who seek to take their place must die as well.  Let us allow Israel to win thier war, once and for all.  Only then will peace come.  Most Palestinians want stability and safety, and this can only be gaurenteed through an Israeli administration.  Israel should select the interim Palestinian leadership, and provide them with the means to enforce their governance.  At least until the marginalized Palestinians can be shown a safe, prosperous future away from radical Islam.  Those that cannot accept this must be removed.  The same applies for our current conflict.  We risk becoming just like the weary Israeli Army.  If we continue to bind our own hands and refuse to eradicate our enemies at the behest of a weak-willed world, we will have no other end.  You cannot defeat your enemy, and then allow them back in power as a show of good faith.  Iraq and Afghanastan belong to us for the moment.  We should make the appropriate decisions FOR the people, until they have established the credentials to form a credible government.  The conquered territories are like children.  Do you allow your kids to govern the house, or do you structure their lives and control their actions as much as you can, until they can take care of themselves?  There is an element of tyranny in parenting, but no one sees it as evil.  Our occupation and reformation of a broken culture is nothing more than an act of parenting as we try to raise these people to become responsible members of civilization.  I fear we have lost the will in Iraq.  The populace clamors to get out at all costs.  If we do, and the region devolves to chaos, the naysayers will claim victory, and we will have to do it all over again in ten years.  What will be the bill then?  We need to press for victory, now, at any price.  We need to ignore our critics and do what must be done.  We don't enjoy killing, but we can't shy away from it when it becomes neccesary to secure a free, safe world.    There was a time when England understood this.  We were the ones on the sideline, trying to avoid getting involved.  Now our positions seem to be reversed.  We can't lose our nerve on this.

       urlLink OpinionJournal - Best of the Web Today   A quick excerpt that deals with our favorite amphibian nation: France.  Tax Revolt, French Style The oh-so-civilized French are responding to high taxes by pillaging, the Scotsman reports:  The French government [Friday] announced a freeze on cigarette taxes in a fresh attempt to placate angry tobacco shop owners hit by a wave of robberies since taxes rose 20 per cent last month. . . .  Attacks on France's 34,000 tobacconists have risen sharply since the price of a top brand of cigarettes was raised to 4.60 [euros] (£3.20) from 3.90, turning the quintessentially French habit of smoking into a luxury.  Things have got so bad that tobacconists have even been targeted by ram-raiders--thieves who smash stolen cars into shop fronts in a technique usually reserved for jewellery stores.  The Associated Press, meanwhile, reports from Paris that wine makers are encouraging Frenchmen to drink and drive:  The $18 billion-a-year wine industry is fighting back against a government campaign to discourage drunk driving. It claims the government is scaring people away from ordering a glass when they go out and points to a 15 percent drop in wine sales at restaurants.  "People are so afraid of the police these days that they're not drinking any wine at all," Pascal Bobillier-Monnot, director of CNAOC national wine producers' association, said Friday.  Wine makers have always promoted moderate drinking to comply with the country's blood-alcohol limit of .05. But they say the government is overreacting when it tells drivers that the safest way to stay out of trouble is not to drink at all.   The AP also reports that municipal officials in Lyon littered the streets with 10,000 pieces of fake dog poop in an effort "to get people to do something that's never been done in France: obey the pooper-scooper law. The bright red plastic decoys were meant to raise awareness about the law and remind violators that they face a $45 fine for letting their dogs soil the sidewalks."   The AP notes that "the sidewalks of France's major cities remain pungent minefields of canine excrement." Sounds like a quagmire to us.  ME: Just a note, the cost in USD is $529 a pack for cigarettes in France now. Anyone want to tell me what the price is domestically?

       urlLink The Wal-Martization of America   The NYT with its basic Communist rhetoric. Why should a Wal-Mart drone be given enough money to not be "poor"? They certainly don't deserve it. They earn exactly what they are worth. Higher wages will do nothing but raise costs for consumers. It's just as absurd as raising the minimum wage. Doing that does nothing for the "poor." They are still just as "poor" as they were before. Their income is still low.   This crazy idea of a "living wage" is just communism. "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need." - Marx. Why should the unskilled and basically worthless people that work at Wal-Mart be allowed to steal money from others? Because they are "poor"? I say, let Wal-Mart come in and destroy all the stores that depend on union labor. I would prefer the abolition of all unions, but replacing the jobs themselves with non-union members will do just as well.

In April, Edward Norton said of Bush: “As an actor, I know in my mind, watching him, what a low-quality mind he has.”   Fight Club is one of my favorite movies, and now when I watch it I can't escape the fact that both Norton and Brad Pitt think I am just another moron, incapable of deep thought.

       urlLink OpinionJournal - The Western Front   Finally! Some good news out of Iraq collected.  "The death of an American soldier is front page news, while the death of his attacker is buried deep inside the paper, if reported at all. But there's another reason why the response to attacks are rarely reported. The military judiciously applies force, which means there's often no big explosion to show the viewing public back home. The enemy blows up civilians, while coalition forces use precision strikes to remove enemy combatants. But more to the point, the media are a lazy beast and, it seems, the Pentagon hasn't been doing a good job feeding it."

      I decided to Blog the email exchange I had with Steve this morning, since it got me rolling a bit. I invite other comments as always, but since about two people actually read this crap, I'm not holding my breath.  (Oh, and I appreciate the two that I have....)  Steve started with a link to a Drudge story about a developing EU trade war with the US.  I responded:  The EU trade war?  Just a matter of time.  But really, we screwed this one up with those stupid steel tariffs.  There  should be no tariffs of any kind as a form of protectionism.  There are uses for them in cases of punitive action against another country though....   Bush screwed up with Steel, and I argued against it from day one.  If an industry can't compete, let it fail.  Steve then replied:    the market... Do you think 'the market' is a factor in creating (for lack of a better term) wars?  Then I replied:  There is an old adage, and I don't know who said it.  "If goods are not permitted to cross borders, troops will."  The economic pressures that lead to war are exacerbated by the artificial constraints imposed by protectionism.  Of course, some wars have little to do with economics, but I think at some core, economics contributes.  It is hard to maintain a cadre of terrorists when the source population has an economic interest in peace.  The Palestinians do not have this interest, and for all of the oil wealth in the Arabian lands, their people see little benefit.  Radicalism is bred in poverty.  This is why I favor the approach we are taking with China.  We have strong ideological differences with China, but the flow of goods and money has entangled ourselves with them.  Both sides see a war as far too costly of an undertaking, so it is best to be avoided.  Ideological conversion will flow from business and the market.  The answer is never protectionism of failing industries.  Our mistake is viewing capitalism is a system that offers 30-40 year stability in employment.  Those that are being hurt are those that have not learned to constantly reinvent themselves and to acquire new marketable skills.  The union steel worker is no longer required when it can be done more efficiently in other parts of the world.  We need to let those industries go and reallocate the freed labor to other tasks.  This means those laborers must be prepared to find new work.  There are no guarantees.  It really is the best system, since it takes care of it's own obsolete industry through creative destruction.  Any artificial means of prolonging the death throes of a business harms the entire system.  If there is money to be made in Taiwan steel, then capital should flow to Taiwan, seeking the maximum return on investment.  Meanwhile, the 'hole' left here is filled by some other task or service that we have an advantage in providing.    This is why all the tech support jobs are going to India.  Those that provide these jobs here are no longer valued for their skill.  Therefore, those individuals must learn new skills and be ready to change.  We are the best in the world at innovation in the tech sector, but that does not extend to the ask of supporting existing, mature technologies.  Focus on what we are good at, and move on.  Protectionism only hurts the protected.  For decades, Japan kept out our products through high tariffs, and now they are paying the price in their economy.  They have been in a slump for ten years now, and are finally allowing industries to fail.  It isn't popular, but the medicine must be administered.  These protected jobs, 'the walking dead', are finally being seen for what they are.  The capital and labor tied up in these inefficient jobs are hindering the creation of new jobs, since the labor market is artificially tight, and new industries must pay too much to attract labor and investment.    Make sense?  And that was the end of it.  Feel free to flame away if you favor protectionism.

      A collection of letters on drug price controls.     Re "Open Door to Drug Imports," editorial, Nov. 6: We don't need to import drugs from Canada. Instead, we need to import Canadian drug prices.  Medicare already has in place mechanisms to control the fees and prices of physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other providers of health-care services and products. Although it is not a perfect process, rates are set to cover expenses and provide a fair profit. The system prevents excessive payments to providers.  If a bona fide prescription benefit were to be added to the Medicare program, the same fair rules would be applied to the pharmaceutical firms. Drugs are an essential element of modern health care. It's time to include them in Medicare under a similar regulatory process that would ensure affordability.  Our system of funding Medicare has not prevented the development of newer medical technology. Likewise, it will not prevent the development of newer pharmaceutical agents. The drug companies will always strive to earn their share of the $1.66 trillion that we are already spending on health care.  Don McCanne MD San Juan Capistrano  * The solution is not importing prescriptions but mandating fair-pricing practices. If a manufacturer can sell at reduced prices to Canadian pharmacies, the same prices should be available to pharmacies in the U.S.  Everyone is complaining about rising health-care costs, which stem from high drug costs, yet we turn our heads when the solution is so clear. In order to keep health insurance rates down, we have to keep drug prices down. This means that the manufacturers must be accountable for fair and equitable pricing.  Importation is a simple fix to some, without attempting to solve the problem. We have to lower the cost of medications by making the pricing the same for Canada and the U.S. Only when this happens will the costs of health care be controlled.  Charles S. Franklin Pharmacist, La Quinta * There is a big controversy over the importation of drugs from Canada at prices far below those paid in the U.S. The reality is: It costs $500 million to $1 billion, plus 10 years, to create a profitable drug, and not all drugs earn a profit. The drug companies have adopted a policy of expecting the U.S., as the most prosperous nation, to amortize the majority of the development costs. If countries that buy the drugs at reduced prices export these drugs into the U.S. market, then the drug companies will either raise the price to these countries or limit their supply.  It may cost only 10 cents to manufacture a pill, but if the first pill costs $1 billion, who is going to buy it?  Gary A. Robb Los Feliz

      What is the Matrix?  Unfortunately, it turned out to be a steaming pile of waste matter.  I can’t stand it anymore.  This post will be a confirmation that I have no life, other than sitting around and analyzing movies in excruciating detail.  Some of you get passionate about football or hockey, I get passionate about the Matrix, but only because of what I saw in it.    I have dreamed a dream, and now that dream has been taken from me.  The original Matrix, which I’m assuming most of you have seen, was a very entertaining, smart film that introduced some fascinating ideas.  While these ideas are not new, mostly being derived from Plato’s work The Cave, the treatment was handled well.  We got some great action sequences, with enough mystery to suggest there was a lot more going on.  I was content with that, and looked forward to the next films, but not with the sort of anticipation that made it an obsession.  Not until a week or so before Reloaded opened.  At that point, I started to think about what they would do with the story.  Where would they go?  I operated off of an assumption – The Wachowski Brothers (henceforth referred to as the Ws) were indeed intelligent, consistent film makers and story tellers, and the small flaws and problems in the Original movie had to exist for a reason.  The flaws were far too easy to fix, so I couldn’t imagine them being simple mistakes.  Take the concept that humans are just a source of energy.  If the machines needed us for energy, why go through all the trouble of keeping us awake, or serving us a reality in which to live?  Why not just remove most of our higher brain functions and plug us in?  Why not use cows, or sheep, or some other organism that would produce the required heat?  It seemed a silly need, so I assumed it was a lie.  Also, when Neo is ejected from his Pod, why wouldn’t the machines investigate why Neo woke up?  Why just kick him out and flush him, allowing him to be recovered by Morpheus and crew?  There was something more going on.  And Zion.  Surely it would take very little resources for the Machines to do away with Zion.  There had to be a reason it was allowed to exist.  Those type of problems led me to think there was something more going on.  The night before it opened, Mike and I spoke through instant messenger for nearly three hours, exploring the logical answers to those problems.  I still have that chat file saved, as evidence of our thoughts.  Our conversation ranged over many possibilities, but here is where we ended up.  The battery explanation could not be correct.  I felt that humans were needed to provide something the machines needed from us.  Perhaps they needed our neural matter to support their processing, or perhaps we supplied the emotional and creative impulse that they could not manufacture.  They lacked a ‘soul’, so they bottled us and tapped into ours.  We were integral to the machine existence, and because they went through such great lengths to keep us alive, and to stimulate our minds, we had to provide something more tangible than waste heat.  So why did they allow Neo and the others to be freed from their pods?  Why allow Zion?  I thought that the machine was actually feeding off of the emotional struggle of the Zionists against the Machine.  The rebellion was a source of energy, and by letting the Zionist think that they actually could fight the machine, the machine was drawing power from the human passion for resistance.  This led us to believe that Zion was not real, and no one was really free.  They were all still jacked into the system, and it was a game of deception.    Further exploration suggested that if Neo was the key, then there was a good chance he was not real.  Or at least not human.  The legend of the One stimulated a more passionate resistance.  He was the hope the humans needed to think they could really resist.  There was also speculation that Trinity and Morpheus were not real either, but that was less firm.  All of these things suggest complex, rich story lines that would blow away the original Matrix, and reveal it all as a lie.  And Matrix: Reloaded confirmed our thoughts.  Almost everything we speculated turned out to be true.  And there were even more hints that the story was even richer than we imagined.  If you have not seen Reloaded, I’m going to provide spoilers.  But really, it doesn’t matter, because Revolutions cast it all away.    Reloaded revealed so many things.  It is difficult to know where to start.  The beauty of the movie is that nothing concrete is actually said.  We have long passages of richly complex dialogue, and if you have not peered deeper into the story, it seems to say nothing.  If you considered the small problems of the original, the dialogue is a rich reward for your efforts.  Suggestions are made that fit with our thoughts.  Hints expand on what we think is true, pulling the curtain back a little more each time.    We are caught up in the struggle between Zion and the Machine, but we start to sense that something isn’t right.  The Oracle, once seen as a helper of the humans, darkly hints that things are going to end soon.  But in her speech, she suggests that Neo is indeed something other than a human, and talks about the ultimate need for all programs to have Purpose.  All things that exist have Purpose, and I extend that to the existence of Zion.  There is a reason for it all.  She tells Neo of the existence of someone called the Merovingian, and he needs to see this man.  The Merovingian has something that Neo will need, a program called the Keymaker.  The Keymaker is, pardon me….’key’ to Neo getting where he needs to be.  About this time, Agent Smith shows up.  If you recall, Smith was ‘destroyed’ by Neo at the end of the first movie, when Neo went inside Smith and blew him apart.  Agent Smith has changed.  He is now his own man.  And he has the ability to create copied of himself by taking over other ‘people’ in the Matrix.  In a wonderful little speech, he reveals more of what is going on.    Smith: Surprised to see me? Neo: No. Smith: Then you're aware of it. Neo: Of what? Smith: Our connection. I don't fully understand how it happened. Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me, something overwritten or copied. That is at this point irrelevant, what matters is that whatever happened, happened for a reason. Neo: And what reason is that? Smith: I killed you, Mister Anderson, I watched you die... With a certain satisfaction, I might add, and then something happened. Something that I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway. You destroyed me, Mister Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do but I didn't. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey. And now here I stand because of you, Mister Anderson, because of you I'm no longer an agent of the system, because of you I've changed - I'm unplugged - a new man, so to speak, like you, apparently free. Neo: Congratulations. Smith: Thank you. But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we're here. We're not here because we're free, we're here because we're not free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose - because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist. Smith 2: It is purpose that created us, Smith 3: Purpose that connects us, Smith 4: Purpose that pulls us, Smith 5: That guides us, Smith 6: That drives us, Smith 7: It is purpose that defines, Smith 8: Purpose that binds us. Smith: We're here because of you, Mister Anderson, we're here to take from you what you tried to take from us. Purpose.  Smith’s key line - We're not here because we're free, we're here because we're not free.  It reveals more of the truth of reality.  Smith has been seeking Zion in the first movie, and now he knows the truth.  Zion is not real either, and he has no escape from the system.  His Purpose was to find Zion, but there is nothing to find.  Later, they go to see the Merovingian, to try to get the Keymaker.  The Merovingian happens to be French, which is pretty amusing.  Oh, if you look up Merovingian, you find it is a nobility title, referring to the first founder of a line of Dukes.    Merovingian: Aha, here he is at last. Neo, the One himself, right? And the legendary Morpheus. And Trinity of course, si belle qu'elle me fait souffrir. [Trans: so beautiful she makes me suffer.] I have heard so much, you honour me. Please, sit, join us. This is my wife, Persephone. Something to eat? Drink? Hmm... of course, such things are contrivances like so much here. For the sake of appearances. Neo: No, thank you. Merovingian: Yes, of course, who has time? Who has time? But then if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time? Château Haut-Brion 1959, magnificent wine, I love French wine, like I love the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favourite - fantastic language, especially to curse with. Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperie de connard d'enculé de ta mère! [Trans: Name of God of whore of brothel of shit of filth of jerk of fucking your mother up the ass.] You see, it's like wiping your arse with silk, I love it. Morpheus: You know why we are here.  Merovingian: Hmph... I am a trafficker of information, I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here? Morpheus: We are looking for the Keymaker.  Merovingian: Oh yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course. But this is not a reason, this is not a `why.' The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is means, it is not an end, and so, to look for him is to be looking for a means to do... what? Neo: You know the answer to that question. Merovingian: But do you? You think you do but you do not. You are here because you were sent here, you were told to come here and you obeyed. [Laughs] It is, of course, the way of all things. You see, there is only one constant, one universal, it is the only real truth: causality. Action. Reaction. Cause and effect. Morpheus: Everything begins with choice.  Merovingian: No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion, created between those with power, and those without. Look there, at that woman. My God, just look at her. Affecting everyone around her, so obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait... Watch - you see, I have sent her dessert, a very special dessert. I wrote it myself. It starts so simply, each line of the program creating a new effect, just like poetry. First, a rush... heat... her heart flutters. You can see it, Neo, yes? She does not understand why - is it the wine? No. What is it then, what is the reason? And soon it does not matter, soon the why and the reason are gone, and all that matters is the feeling itself. This is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it, we fight to deny it, but it is of course pretense, it is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance, the truth is we are completely out of control. Causality. There is no escape from it, we are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it, to understand the `why.' `Why' is what separates us from them, you from me. `Why' is the only real social power, without it you are powerless. And this is how you come to me, without `why,' without power. Another link in the chain. But fear not, since I have seen how good you are at following orders, I will tell you what to do next. Run back, and give the fortune teller this message: Her time is almost up. Now I have some real business to do, I will say adieu and goodbye. Neo: This isn't over. Merovingian: Oh yes, it is. The Keymaker is mine and I see no reason why I should give him up. No reason at all. Persephone: Where are you going? Merovingian: Please, ma chérie, I've told you, we are all victims of causality. I drink too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect. Au revoir [Trans: Goodbye].  The key to the story is the battle between two different ways of being.  The machines are mired in causality.  They lack the understanding of intuitive choice that masters the human mind.  The Merovingian is part of the machine mentality, and sees all as deterministic.  Persephone, for her own reasons, decides to give Neo and company a chance to get the Keymaker.  She demands a price for helping Neo.  Neo must kiss her as if he was kissing Trinity.  He must make Persephone believe she is Trinity.  You can see her in this moment feasting on the power of Neo’s passion, and to me it is another clue about what the machines need from us.  Oh, as we also see the world’s coolest urinal in this scene.  So they manage to get the Keymaker, after an amazing action sequence.  During the scene, the Merovingian refers to Neo’s predecessors, meaning there have been other attempts at making the One, and indeed, the Merovingian himself is a former attempt at making the One.    And the final important scene….  Neo has been plagued with dreams of Trinity dying in the Matrix.  He asks her to stay out during the final sequence, and she agrees.  But a serious of improbably coincidences in the ‘real world’ creates circumstances that force Trinity to enter the Matrix.  These coincidences, to me, are proof that the ‘real world’ is under the influence of the machine, and is just another pocket inside the Matrix.  This takes place while Neo finally reaches the Architect, the creator of the Matrix.  Here is what takes place –   The Architect - Hello, Neo.  Neo - Who are you?  The Architect - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.  Neo - Why am I here?  The Architect - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.  Neo - You haven't answered my question.  The Architect - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "Others? What others? How many? Answer me!"*  The Architect - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.  *Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "Five versions? Three? I've been lied too. This is bullshit."*  Neo: There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.  The Architect - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly's systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  *Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "You can't control me! F*ck you! I'm going to kill you! You can't make me do anything!*  Neo - Choice. The problem is choice.  *The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room*  The Architect - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being, thus I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.  Neo - The Oracle.  The Architect - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked, would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.  Neo - This is about Zion.  The Architect - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.  Neo - Bullshit.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "Bullshit!"*  The Architect - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.  *Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architects room.*  The Architect - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals, 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.  Neo - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.  The Architect - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.  *The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*  The Architect - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.  *Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*  Neo - Trinity.  The Architect - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.  Neo - No!  The Architect - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.  *Neo walks to the door on his left*  The Architect - Humph. Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.  Neo - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.  The Architect - We won't.  And there we have it.  The Architect is the deterministic mind, and the One is a project to create an intuitive mind such as a human.  I read this as evidence that Neo is not really a true human.  He is a construct, but it is still important that he thinks of himself as human.  The One is designed to carry an affinity for humans, and to identify and act like one.  This is why it has failed many times.  The other incarnations of the One have ‘gone native’, just like the Merovingian.  They refused to embrace their purpose, and have diverged from the intended path.    There are many different ways to interpret what this all means.  The one I prefer is as follows: Zion is a place to store those that cannot accept the true nature of the Matrix.  They are placed there, out of the way, and the Machines allow them to believe they are fighting their little war.  In fact, the machines are providing the sort of reality that these rebellious types prefer.  So the ‘epic’ battle between man and machine is just another layer of deception, to keep them out of the way.  But this creates instability in the Matrix, and over time, it becomes too difficult to keep it all going.  So they wipe it clean and ‘reboot’.  Neo is actually being manipulated to enhance his affinity for the humans, and everything to this point has been a bit of a game to prod his natural evolution.  It is conceivable that Trinity is not real, she might be a construct designed for Neo to love.  Morpheus is an unwitting tool, serving the machine by stirring up the rebellion amongst the Zion humans.  He is doing the work of the machine by pumping Neo full of myth and legend.  And the Oracle….what interest does she serve?  In the end, Agent Smith finds a way to manifest himself in the real world of Zion, and Neo suddenly is able to exercise his Matrix type powers in Zion.  Those two issues are never addressed in Reloaded, but what else can it mean??  If these abilities exist, then Zion can not be real!  It is proof that this is all a lie, but the movie ends there with the promise of Revolutions.  I cannot explain the angst, hatred, and devastation I experienced with Revolutions.  I could not wait for all of these truths to be revealed to us.  I wanted to see the moment when Morpheus realized his passionate life’s dream was just another lie.  I wanted to see him break.  I wanted to see how Neo would react when he understood his purpose was to allow the machines to exist without humans.  Neo’s ultimate purpose was to allow the disposal of humanity.  And I wanted to see that Smith, by opposing Neo and the Architect, really was the anti-hero…the man who would save humanity by bringing it all down.  Nothing was as it seemed, and there was so much promise of an ending the likes of which I have never seen in a Hollywood movie.  Alas, Revolutions was a great steaming pile of crap.  None of these wonderful ideas were explored.  We got our video game Independence Day happy ending.  No darkness, no false truth, just a shallow surface that satisfied no one.  But the most maddening thing of it all is the truth that is still buried.  There are plenty of subtle clues in Revolutions that all the things we have speculated are indeed true, but they present it in such a way as to hide all of this glorious truth in a bubble gum ending.  The Oracle and the Architect want the same thing – stability in the Matrix.  The Oracle created Smith to oppose the Architect in his Neo project.  They disagree as to how to reach stability.  The Architect wants to control the humans, and to remove the source of their discontent through engineering.  The Oracle wants to simply discard the rebellious humans, cast them out of the Matrix by giving them their freedom.  Her intent was to make Zion so much trouble, the Architect gets fed up and tosses the humans out.  But her Smith creation got out of control and brought down the Matrix and threatened the existence of the machine.  So the Architect and the Oracle have to get together to protect themselves.  The Architect sacrifices his One project to take out Smith, and the Matrix is then reset.  As part of this bargain, the Architect finally agrees to free the humans who want to be free.    Unfortunately, we never see the true consequence of this act.  The fact that Zion is not real is never revealed.  Instead, we are treated to a CGI fest representing the Battle of Zion, but how can I care about such a thing when I know it doesn’t really exist?  There is no consequence to the Battle, since the destruction of Zion means little in the grand scheme.  We are given the insipid happy ending demanded by the lowest common denominator of movie going audiences.  They get their shallow meaningless ending, while the truth is hidden in such a way, it might as well not be there.  Certainly, there are clues to all I have inferred, but why hide it?  Why cloak such a wonderful story behind this garbage??  Here is the ending I would have preferred.  Trinity dies, as she did in the movie.  Neo confronts the AI about his nature, and discovers that he is not real, and this has all been a project to make humans obsolete.  But he finds hope that he can still be a service to the humans he has grown to love.  Trinity is gone, he has nothing to live for, but he can still help in one last act.  He agrees to take out Smith, to save the machines, but the Zion humans must be shown the truth and given a choice.  They can be cast out in the actual, truly real world, to try to live an impossible existence on a blasted planet, or they can return to the Matrix and be imprinted with the personality that can accept the Matrix, the code held inside of Neo because of his hybrid nature.  He will complete the One project, but humans must be allowed to be free.  In a sense, he sides with the Oracle in the preferred solution.  We see the Battle of Zion freeze in mid-action, with some crazy bullet time camera work looking at the frozen tableau from many angles.  Then it all dissolves into Matrix code…leaving the humans imprisoned in the white room of the construct.  A bare existence for the moment.  The battle for Zion did not matter, since it was all just an exercise to motivate Neo, to drive his empathy and affinity, to make him more like a human.  Other than that, it served no real purpose since the Zion humans were never free anyway.  Neo takes out Smith, just as he did in the movie, and is destroyed and absorbed back into the machine…his code disseminated.    The Architect speaks to the humans in Zion and tells him of Neo’s choice.  He shows them the true reality on the outside, and gives them time to decide which they prefer.  We see Morpheus, a shattered man, confronting the truth that his entire purpose, his entire life, was a lie.  Morpheus makes his choice.    In the closing scene, we see Morpheus, in a suit and tie, sitting in a massive room filled with cubicles, doing some mindless task.  He can’t seem to figure out why his life doesn’t feel right.  We see the despair in his eyes as he struggles to remember something that he just can’t seem to put a finger on.  All he knows is that this isn’t right.  As he said in the original, “It is like a splinter in your mind.”  And that could have been a magnificent ending.  At least in my mind.  Instead, we get one of the worst films ever made.  And the real pain lies in what it COULD have been.  Thanks for sticking with this.  I had to get it out of me, because it hurts.

       urlLink Death Be Not Loud   DOWD!!  DOWD's words will be indented, mine will not.       There are those who say Mr. Bush should have emulated Rudy Giuliani's empathetic leadership after 9/11, or Dad's in the first gulf war, and attended some of the funerals of the 379 Americans killed in Iraq. Or one.  WHY? Why give a spectacle to the work of our enemies? Why celebrate their deaths? Does anyone doubt this would be seen as anything but a sign of weakness? The President no doubt cares for the soldiers in Iraq, but the fact is it is the job they want to do. They can quit anytime. Death is a possibility of the job, and the ultimate sacrifice should not be cheapened by the media's quest for sensation.       But let's look at it from the president's point of view: if he grieves more publicly or concretely, if he addresses every instance of bad news, like the hideous specter of Iraqis' celebrating the downing of the Chinook, he will simply remind people of what's going on in Iraq.  Does anyone really not know what is going on in Iraq? By "going on" DOWD and I both mean the bad news. No one it seems knows or cares about all the good being done. Or the ultimate good of freeing people from tyranny. A public display of grief by the President would only encourage the terrorists to redouble their efforts so as to get more of the same. This war requires stoicism, a much-maligned and misunderstood virtue. When the cost and results of terrorism are no longer worth the cost, such attacks will decrease. I still clamor for the Dead Terrorist Body Count ticker, just as we have the Dead US Soldier one.       So it's understandable why, going into his re-election campaign, Mr. Bush wouldn't want to underscore that young Americans keep getting whacked over there, and we don't know who is doing it or how to stop it.       The White House is cleverly trying to distance Mr. Bush from the messy problem of flesh-and-blood soldiers with real names dying nearly every day, while linking him to the heroic task of fighting global terror.  We DO know who is doing it, and we DO know how to stop it! This woman makes me want to erupt into profanity by her idiocy. If she was saying this to my face I would be unable to restrain physical action. We know the ones doing this are Muslim extremists and thugs. We know how to stop them. By finding them and killing them. And every day we come closer to that goal.   The President IS the foremost citizen in the war on terror. It exists because he is executing the collective will of the USA. Bush is not himself the one killing our soldiers, our citizens. Our enemies are killing them. And people like DOWD are giving aid and comfort to them, just as Jane Fonda and her ilk did in Vietnam. If our enemies knew for certain that we could not be dissuaded they would realize their cause is hopeless. Our job would become easier. But people like DOWD hate our nation, our very way of life. They want us to fail. They want power, to say how things should be. We must not let them ever regain power.        If he gets more explicit, or allows the flag-draped coffins of fallen heroes to be photographed coming home, it will just remind people that the administration said this would be easy, and it's teeth-grindingly hard. And that the administration vowed to get Osama and Saddam and W.M.D., and hasn't. And that the Bush team that hyped the presence of Al Qaeda in Iraq has now created an Al Qaeda presence in Iraq.  No one said this would be easy. I recall several speeches where the President told us it would be hard, full of sacrifice and dark days. This is actually far easier than I could have dreamed. The only truly "hard" part is in the minds of those like DOWD. We never vowed to get Osama and W.M.D. We vowed to make every effort to find them and neutralize them. The "created" presence of Al-Queda in Iraq is a godsend. Bring them on! Every soldier in Iraq knows that they are a shield for those of us in the USA. By drawing fire from the helpless they save lives. DOWD cheapens their sacrifice by saying it is pointless, that by losing this war we would be better off.        "If a helicopter were hit an hour later, after he came out and spoke, should he come out again?" Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, told The Times' Elisabeth Bumiller, explaining Mr. Bush's silence after the Chinook crash. The public, he added, "wants the commander in chief to have proper perspective, and keep his eye on the big picture and the ball."       The ball for fall is fund-raising. President Bush has been going full throttle since summer, spending several days a week flying around the country, hitting up rich Republicans for $2,000 checks. He has raised $90 million so far out of the $175 million he plans to spend on a primary campaign in which he has no opponent.  I think this is a great use of his time. He has deputies like the great Donald Rumsfeld to handle the daily concerns of the War on Terror. And Bush MUST become the nest President. The fight must continue to be won. He needs money so he can win the hearts and minds of an American public confused and deceived by the Left and their Media.        At fund-raisers, Mr. Bush prefers to talk about the uptick in the economy, not the downtick in Iraq. On Monday, arriving for a fund-raiser in Birmingham, he was upbeat, not somber. As Mike Allen of The Washington Post reported in his pool report, "The president, who gave his usual salute as he stepped off Marine One, appeared to start the day in a fabulous mood. . . . An Alabama reporter who was under the wing shouted, `How long will U.S. troops be in Iraq?' The president gave him an unnappreciative look."  I don't blame him! What an asinine question to ask. The answer has always been "Until the job is done." What other answer could there be but defeat? I am glad the President is putting on an air of confidence. It infuriates his adversaries and encourages his friends. It is obvious DOWD things the Commander-in-Chief should be totally depressed and despondent because of the Iraq "quagmire." Perhaps the truth makes some glad and others angry?       Raising $1.8 million at lunch, he stuck to the line that "we are aggressively striking the terrorists in Iraq, defeating them there so we will not have to face them in our own country." He didn't want to depress the donors by mentioning the big news story, the loss of 15 American soldiers, or sour the mood by conceding the obvious, that the swelling horde of terrorists fighting us there will not prevent terrorists from coming after us here. Maybe we should all be like President Bush and not read the papers so we don't get worn down either.  The obvious? The OBVIOUS!? Since when did killing our enemies abroad not do anything but reduce the amounts of our enemies everywhere? DOWD seems to think that terrorists just pop out of the ground or fall out of trees when shook by the touch of America. Much as the popular myth about the origins of pharmaceuticals, this legend is false. We aren't in Iraq just to kill terrorists, we are aiming a dagger at the very heart of the problem: the Islamic culture. Once they become like the rest of the world the problem will be solved. I want them to be defeated by us, not the other way around. DOWD and her cronies and accomplices seem to favor our defeat if it would hurt Bush. That is almost treasonous.  I love the last jab about not reading the papers. Why should he since it is all the same inane ball all the time? Most people don't read newspapers because they aren't important. And why should the Leader of the Free World waste time with a sycophant like ball? I have nothing better to do, but the President of the United States has a war to win.

       urlLink Boston.com / News / Politics / Democrats embracing drug imports   I feel the need to point this out yet again.  Yes, I work for Pfizer, and this affects me, but even before I worked here, I was completely and utterly opposed to importing drugs from Canada.  Excerpt: "The FDA is clearly the handmaiden of the pharmaceutical industry on this issue," Dean said in a telephone interview. "The Canadians don't have any different drug handling than we do." Opening the border to the flow of medicine from Canada would force the US pharmaceutical industry to lower prices, said Dean.  "Their business practices are anticompetitive," he said. "All I ask is that drug companies compete on price, just like everyone else."   Me: This is the most asinine thing I've heard Dean say.  The drugs don't COME from Canada.  The Left thinks that these pills just fall from trees in Canada, to be scooped up by workers and packaged for shipment.  ALL patented, new drugs are sent to Canada from US firms, only to be shipped right back here through these importation plans.  People like Dean seems to think this is 'competition'.  It is like legalizing the sale of stolen goods from the back of a truck.  The thieves rob the Best Buy stock truck and sell the goods in the parking lot for half price, and the politicians think this is 'competition' and 'fair market policy'.  Exceprt: "Americans now know -- it's no longer a secret," said US Representative Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, one of the nine Democrats in the primary race. "People are hot about this, and they are demanding a response."  Me: This again strikes at the fundamental core difference between the Left and Right.  The Left believes in serving the majority, regardless of the long term impact.  They believe in Democracy, which will destroy us one day.  The Right believes that our officials have a duty to protect the law from the passion of the mob.  We expect them to constrain our impulses, because the mob is seldom right.  They are tasked with studying the issues and making the correct long term decision, even if we don't like it.  Unfortunately, since there are so many perks to being in office, few really do what is right over what is popular.    Exceprt: "It makes no sense to pay the highest prices in the world, and other industrialized countries get the benefit of all that largesse from American taxpayers, and they pay far less for the drugs," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.  Me: I agree with Gephardt (the horror!), but I know he didn't mean what he just said. His answer is to screw the drug companies, and ultimately, the public.  My answer is to take on price controls over seas through sanctions and an aggressive policing of overseas patent violations.  If Canada doesn't want to pay market price, and they threaten to violate patents if we don't submit to thier extortion, then we should slap massive, punative fiscal punishment down on them.  Free trade is only free when all sides honor it.

      Okay, I'm back to the Blog today.  Yesterday I took the morning off to see Matrix: Revolutions, and the impact was so devestating, I could not bring myself to Blog.  I might go into it later, but the movie cast me into despair and anger.  If you didn't like Reloaded, or didn't see it, DON'T go see Revolutions.  If you did like Reloaded, DON'T go see Revolutions.  I could write ten thousand words on why, but I'll spare you that here.  So, look for some more posting later today.

       urlLink Ain't It Cool News - View Article   This is a "review" of Matrix Revolutions. I originally sent this to Todd as an email, but I think it should be shared with the world. Some slightly harsh language follows.  Funny how he didn't think the fights in Reloaded were worth anything. I thought they were phenomenal. Much more satisfying than the first movie's. But then again, I don't look for meaning in beating things up real good.   "This time, the ACTIONS define the characters, not lengthy tired monologues out of 2nd Year College Comparative Religion Studies or Basic Human Psyche-courses. This time they focus the story on individual POINTS OF VIEW, so that we can have a HUMAN GUIDE through the spectacle at any given moment. This time, the ACTIONS define the characters, not lengthy tired monologues out of 2nd Year College Comparative Religion Studies or Basic Human Psyche-courses. This time they focus the story on individual POINTS OF VIEW, so that we can have a HUMAN GUIDE through the spectacle at any given moment."  Hah! What a turd Fat Harry is! He couldn't take all the standing around and talking. I bet he almost sunk into his fat rolls when the Architect laid down the law for Neo. You and I are the only ones who realize that you could put an "action sequence here" placard in for all the fighting and whatnot and still have a great movie.  "Big PowerSuit battle versus a bajillion squiddies. COOL. If I hear one more person say, "ALIENS" in regards to those suits, I'm liable to roll my eyes and consider them addicted to lead paint chips. Please - for my amusement. Point to the scene in ALIENS, where the outfits were firing 150mm exploding rounds into bajillions of Squiddies in a last stand to save humanity."  This promises to be the most painful and RoboCop2-esque sequence in recent memory. How stupid is it to make power armor suits that leave the meat exposed? I can't see myself experiencing joy during this CG-fest the way I did in the freeway chase in TMR.  "THEN - I get in the car, and Father Geek and I are backing out of our driveway, and a FED EX truck pulls in front of the house. Mr. Fed Ex Man, gets out and gives me the big ol package, and leaves. I see that it's from Alex Ross, so I open it like a boy on Christmas Morning and it's his new book - MYTHOLOGY. That collection of all of Alex Ross' DC art. OH JOY."  First off, WTF? Who gives a flying F about his comic books? What does this have to do with the movie? I guess it could be excused by explaining his mood at the time of viewing. And secondly, he still lives with his parents! I realize I do too, and I don't expect to be taken seriously until I am on my own. So I cannot take Fatass seriously either.  "Well, the odd thing is: MATRIX REVOLUTIONS restores everything you thought and believed in the first film. At least it did for me. Oh sure, without the second film, you wouldn't know who the Merovingian was or the Architect, but ya know what? As key as they are, they're not the cat's pajamas."  Uh-oh. This is bad. I thought the first movie was OK. Just OK. I loved it at first, but then I realized it was all promise and no delivery. TMR is the TRUE Matrix movie, at least so far. When Lard-Boy gushes that TMRev is the superior, i get scared. I remember how he hated TMR, and that was a religous experience for me. This reminds me of his review for Episode 1.  "You see, The Machines - They're the United States and Capitalism. Ultimately they want society operating in the 9 to 5, eat your food, grab a movie, raise the kids, go to church and get back to work sort of daze. That's the Machine way. Don't worry about the MEANING OF IT ALL just do your job, be a battery and power the big society forward."  I am choking with rage at this very moment. The EVIL USA! He is bashing the very existence that most of the world envies! Must be nice never having to work a day in your life and be a fat slob who is supported by his parents!  "Or you could say AGENT SMITH is that Born Again Christian type that is trying to eradicate another's belief system and ultimately the elimination of both either politically, humanly or functionally is a move towards peace. In the end. when the Big White Man meets the Oracle at the park with the little Indian/Pakistani girl at her side. Essentially the Big White Industrialist is saying, "How long will this peace last?" And she is essentially the U.N. A governing body that tries to disrupt the all powerful and to give all sides a voice. She says, "As long as it can."  More rage is felt against the Fat One. He must think he is writing reviews for the NYT. How else could you explain the sniping against the USA, Christians, capitalism, and white men? The UN seeks to bring up the weak and bring down the strong? I guess Syria and Libya and Iraq were all model societies compared with the evil hegemony of the USA.  "And while we're at it, shaving Agent Smith's head and putting him in the ol Purple and green Lex Luthor outfit and giving him magic powers; well, that'd just own."  The insanity continues! THis time he shouws his contempt for the best martial arts seqence of ALL TIME (the Chateau in TMR)!  "I STILL FEEL those fights were unemotional video game pointless endeavors of masturbation. No fight was ever won or lost. All draws. Every conversation was about standing in the corner and deciding to jack off with the left OR right hand."  This review is feces. The fights were incredible. They were all about exploring what coolness the One is capable of. Like I mentioned earlier, they could have been replaced by a plain text sign and I would still have loved the movie. But to me they were some reward, a treat from the makers of the move. Kind of like how in Star Wars there would be scenes that did nothing but show off.  In short, Fat Harry is a total idiot when it comes to anything under the sun. I used to think he might have some sort of knowledge or understanding, but now it is painfully obvious to everyone that he is a fat idiot who got lucky.

       urlLink Choices for Election Day   This is just too funny.  The NY Times has come out with its list of endorsements for today's local elections in NYC.  Take a good look at the affiliated parties.  WFP?  What is the WFP?  Turns out it is the Working Families Party.  http://www.workingfamiliesparty.org/  Now I must cut and paste what this party stands for:  To create job growth, family-supporting wages and an economic recovery that benefits New Yorkers at all income levels, we support an economic program: that creates a living wage for all New Yorkers; supports the right of all workers to unionize; provides New York’s children with access to quality child care, education, health care, and housing; and develops our economy in an environmentally sustainable way.  All Americans should have universal access to quality, affordable health care, not as a privilege, but as a right. We support a single payer health care system that provides universal coverage and quality medical care. We also oppose privatization of health care delivery and coverage. Our health care system should be structured to provide the health care people need, rather than to provide profits to private corporations.   Our political system has become dominated by corporate special interests and political bosses. The result: a corrupt electoral system, weak labor unions, and economic policies that have increased inequality, lowered our living standards, and degraded our environment. The Working Families Party is being formed to provide a political voice for working New Yorkers. The Working Families Party will voice our concerns and address our aspirations. It will stand for economic justice and an economy that works for all of us. It will be accountable to ordinary New Yorkers, not to corporate contributors or party bosses. It will pursue fairness, opportunity, and prosperity for all New Yorkers.  Me:  Can there be any doubt as to the agenda of the "Newspaper of Record"?

       urlLink Op-Ed Columnist: This Can’t Go On   Krugman is wild-eyed and raving this morning.  Are you guys getting as tired of him as I am?  Krugman: The prime example I have hammered on in this column is, of course, the federal budget. Realistic budget projections say that current policies aren't remotely sustainable. For example, a month ago a joint report of the Committee for Economic Development (a business group), the bipartisan Concord Coalition and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities concluded that under current policies, federal debt would rise by $5 trillion over the next decade. And then baby boomers will start collecting benefits, and our debt will really explode.   Such explosive growth in debt can't go on forever, and it won't. Yet our current leaders and their apologists insist that the problem will magically solve itself. Last year's deficit came in slightly below forecasts, and we've had one quarter of good economic growth — see, we'll grow out of the deficit!  Me:  You know, I'm starting to wonder if Bush has this super-savant type insanity going on.  I have a huge problem with the runaway spending under his watch, but with the terror issue, I'll still support him.  To inject the old drunken sailor metaphor, observe the binge the US government is on.  But perhaps there is something to this.  Yes, I'm being a little fanciful, but there is a tremendous upside to this spending.  The Day of Reckoning is indeed closer than it was before.  We are hurtling toward the cliff, but I think it is a good thing.  The spending levels and the number of insane programs in the federal budget are starting to become a caricature.  No reasonable person can defend half of what we spend on, and as the growing crises becomes more visible, I am starting to believe that the majority of voters want an end to it.  The Bush tax cuts, and there are more to come in the next few years, are robbing the Government of the fuel it needs to continue.  The monster is starving, and it is starting to consume itself in an effort to stay alive.  As the tax cuts keep coming, the idea of a tax increase is unacceptable to most voters.  Yes, I know that a sizable minority pay no taxes, and they will always try to suck more out of government at the expense of the productive, but I think the momentum is switching.  More and more producers are waking to the scam, and they are voting in larger numbers.  The inevitable end to this is a real, true reduction in government spending.  I see no other way.  The growth is not sustainable, and a continued shift of the tax burden to the producers is also not sustainable.  At some point, the monster has to starve, and I think we are getting there.  There is a growing trend toward conservatism in this country, and that means reducing government.  Whether Bush is crazy-smart, or just a lousy republican, the increased spending is accelerating the crises and perhaps bringing us closer to the solution.  Okay, that was my wild-eyed raving.  Back to Krugman.  Krugman: Some Americans may share the views of the Republican congressman who said that progress in Iraq was "a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day." (Support the troops!)  Me:  So we have DOWD, Ivins, the NYT Editorial board, and now Krugman misquoting the Congressman, as I pointed out earlier.  It no longer shocks me to see them manipulate words to serve their ends.  It would be like me quoting Clinton at a famous newsconferece.  "I want you to listen to me.  I....had sex with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky."  Never mind what the ellipses represent.  Those sections of his statement were not contextually relevent.    (In case you don't remember - "I want you to listen to me.  I never, not once never, had sex with that woman, Ms. Lewinski.")  Krugman: Yet we keep expecting a magic solution. We'll get European, Indian and Pakistani forces to help us! But since we went to war without international support, they're not interested. We'll bring in the Turks! But the Iraqi Governing Council itself is bitterly opposed. We'll engage in "Iraqification," creating local forces that take the place of American troops! Let's hope that works — but hope is not a plan.  Me:  No, Mr. Krugman, YOU keep expecting a magic solution.  You want us out of Iraq in months, not years.  You want it done with no death, no trouble, and no expense.  It seems the adults in charge understand that this is going to be damn hard, bloody and expensive...but it is WORTH doing.  Those of you on the Left seem to think that nothing is worth doing if it is hard.  A sad legacy from the party of Kenneday.  "We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard."  Krugman: Just as the federal government is in no immediate danger of running out of money, our forces in Iraq are in no danger of outright defeat. But in both cases, current policies appear to be unsustainable: we can't go on like this indefinitely. And things that can't go on forever, don't.    Me: What a brilliant piece of logic.  No one intends to go on like this forever.  That is why we fight - for an END!

       urlLink The Top Ten Conservative Idiots, No. 133 - Democratic Underground   Take a look at #3 on the list. I used to despise Zell Miller, but now I see him in a new light. My dislike was unfounded and based only on prejudice. My newfound respect and admiration resulted from learning of his voting record, and his public utterances on issues. He is the kind of Democrat that used to make up the party.   If Zell Miller was the average Democrat, I would be one myself. As I've said before on this webpage, I favor a great many "liberal" positions. I do want to change the world, to make things better. I don't like the idea of "conservatism" because it limits us to what has gone before. Admittedly this can be better than the socialism the Left envisions. But many of the traditions and conservative positions are simply outmoded and in need of reconsideration. For example, the War on Drugs.  I will vote for Bush in 2004 alongside Zell Miller. President Bush is simply the only man I can envision leading our country in this current test of strength. Don't be fooled by any Leftist pied pipers. We are in a war for our culture, our dominance must be maintained. Inclusiveness is just another word for submission. Why include unless they are equal or superior? We are right to try to stamp out the strict observance of Islam. Which, in case you didn't know, says all us infidels should be murdered.   The future will either be permanent conflict with Islam, a change in the religion, or its total domination of the earth. I know which future I want to live in. So does the President. The Democrats, with the exception of Zell Miller, do not.

      This is an internal clipping from the Pfizer news digest presented each morning on our internal home page.  So I can't give you a link.  Twenty-two members of Congress have signed a letter asking Attorney General John Ashcroft to investigate whether the pharmaceutical industry has violated antitrust laws by restricting sales to Canadian wholesalers and pharmacies that export to the United States.  ''We must not allow pharmaceutical companies to abuse American consumers, and place lives at risk, by illegally manipulating supply,'' the letter concludes. The letter is on the stationery of Representative Gil Gutknecht, a Republican from Minnesota, who has sponsored legislation that would legalize drug imports from Canada and Europe.  The letter comes in the midst of negotiations on Capitol Hill over the details of a Medicare drug bill that includes a provision to legalize drug imports from Canada and Europe. Among the compromises being discussed is a provision that would restrict the imports solely to those from Canada.  The letter to the attorney general is intended to influence the jockeying among conferees by pointing out how effectively the drug industry has controlled drug supplies to Canada. A bill that permits imports only from Canada may not allow Americans to save much on drug costs, the letter signers say.  ''This underscores that the Canada-only proposals might not be the best solution,'' said Bryan Anderson, press secretary for Mr. Gutknecht.  Minnesota's attorney general, Mike Hatch, has announced that he is investigating GlaxoSmithKline for its efforts to restrict drug supplies to Canada. For their part, Canadian health authorities have expressed alarm that exports to the United States could lead to drug shortages in Canada.  On a conference call with analysts in late October, the chief executive of Pfizer, Henry A. McKinnell, was asked whether the company might some day be required to supply unlimited quantities of drugs to Canadian pharmacies.  ''I'm not sure that the Congress of the United States could take away our patent and trademark rights in Canada,'' Mr. McKinnell said. ''That would be an interesting question.''  End clipping.  So by attempting to control our own product from the abuse of the Canadian government and price controls, we are guilty of abusing American customers??  And this is a Republican doing this to us??  Just goes to show you why I think of myself as a Conservative before I am a Republican.  The ethics of this really bothers me.  Canada is essentially holding us at gunpoint, saying if we refuse to supply them under their price caps, they will simply break our patents and make the products for themselves.  And now we have the US government telling us that we MUST submit to this blackmail, AND we must allow the US market to glom on to these price controls, further eroding our ability to make a profit.  Your medical future is at stake.  Take away the ability to profit from intellectual property, and you'll never see that cure for cancer.  Good luck to all of the short term thinkers out there.

       urlLink Op-Ed Columnist: The End of the West?  This Thomas Freidman guy might be a decent human being there at the Times.  I've believed since the late 90s that the EU will grow to be a primary threat to America, and I do not rule out the possibility of war at some point in the next 20-30 years.  Hard to believe we could ever go to war with Europe, after all we have been through together, but I still think it is possible.  The concentration of economic power in the EU is a fine thing, until that power is used contrary to our collective interest of security and stability.  France and Germany have both demonstrated a willingness to countervene our collective secruity goal through their financing and arming of Saddam in the face of UN sanctions.  France particularly has continued to pose the EU is a strategic 'counterweight' to American power in the world, meaning in plain language - they wish to oppose our positions to prevent us from maintaining our position as the lone superpower.  Hardly the stuff of honest disagreement over policy.    The EU will continue to grow, despite being mired in socialism.  At some point, they will become more competitive, and with that added power, they will continue to pursue their own aims.  As we continue to diverge in our collective goals, the opportunity for real conflict will continue to grow.  Ultimately, the first American-European War might be in the offing.

But of course, a charge of hypocrisy will never stop a devoted Leftist from bringing down a republican.

       urlLink Amazon.com: DVD: I, Claudius (1975)   What I just finished watching....  I've been aware of "I, Claudius" for many years, but never took the time to watch it.  I have to credit Mike for urging this upon me recently.  It is 13 parts, each one hour long, and well worth the investment.  The story follows the rule of Augustus (the adopted son of Julius Caeser, who is also known as Octavius), then on to Tiberius, then the insane Caligula, finally ending with the rule of Claudius, the title character.  It is a fascinating account of the early crumbling of the greatness of Rome.  The petty ambitions of men and women tear it all down, and you can sense the inevitible inertia behind the death of Rome.  It really is a top-notch production, even if it is somewhat old.  The cast is a virtual who's who of fine actors.  Derek Jacobi plays Claudius, afflicted by a limp and a stutter.  Claudius plays the fool, managing to survive assassination and intrigue through his appearance of harmlessness.  It is ironic that he becomes Emperor despite being a rabid Republican, eager to restore the Roman Republic.  Brian Blessed plays Augustus, and he is full of power and energy.  John Hurt, of Alien chest bursting fame, plays the depraved and insane Caligula.  A younger Patrick Stewart plays the leader of the Praetorian Guards, Sejanus, under the reign of Tiberius.  He gets his just end.  John Rhys-Davies has a smaller part as Makro, successor of Sejanus and murdered of Tiberius at the behest of Caligula.  Sian Phillips plays an amazing Livia.  I've seen her in a lot of roles, but for some odd reason, the one that sticks out in my mind is her portrayal of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam in Dune (a movie notable for having more voiceovers than actual dialogue.)  It really is a superlative piece of work.  I'm obsessed with the greatness of the Roman Republic, but this glimpse into the early days of the Empire is just as compelling.  The stench of decay is already upon it, a scant 100 years from the time of Julius Caesar.

      I have returned from a restful vacation, alternatively being slaughtered by Brits and Germans in a simulation of the British paratroop operations on D-Day.  Sadly, we played improperly when I was the British, resulting in the total defeat of the British forces under my command, and giving us another twenty years of Nazi rule in Europe.  After switching sides and learning of our improper play, the pathetic German defenders under my command staged an accurate reproduction of the events of June 6, 1944.  Unfortunately, right about the time the Germans would receive significant reinforcements in the morning of June 7th, our time expired, leaving us with questions of 'what if'.  Quite unsatisfying to tell the truth.  http://www.multimanpublishing.com/ASL/prodpb.php  In case you were wondering what I'm talking about, see link above.

Bush gets 57 percent to Dean's 30 percent among registered voters in the American Research Group poll. In fact, Dean, from neighboring Vermont, does worse in the Granite State than a generic "Democratic Party nominee" who loses to Bush by 51 to 34 percent. Another ARG poll this month showed Dean with a 30-point lead over Sen. John Kerry (Mass.) for the Jan. 27 New Hampshire primary, the second test after the Jan. 19 Iowa caucuses.   The new poll seems sure to fuel claims by rivals that Dean would be another George McGovern debacle for Democrats in the general election.   No need to click the article.

       urlLink CNN.com - Pentagon audit eyes Halliburton - Dec. 12, 2003   Okay, here is the Halliburton overcharging scandal.  Quote "The Pentagon said Thursday a routine review turned up the potential overcharge by subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root, which was awarded a no-bid contract in March to rebuild Iraq's oil industry.   But there is no allegation that Halliburton unduly profited from the overpriced gas.   The audit questions if Halliburton paid above-market rates to a Kuwaiti subcontractor when it paid $2.27 per gallon for the gas. Another supplier bought gas at $1.18 per gallon from Turkey.   Halliburton says the higher cost was due to having to negotiate a short-term contract, at a time when there weren't enough trucks in Kuwait to deliver the fuel. It says trucks had to be brought in and shipping in a war zone pushed up the transportation and security costs as well.   End Quote.  The story goes on to say that the government could simply refuse the bill, leaving the Subsidiary holding the bag.  Sounds like it is just a pricing dispute, which happens all the time in the business world.  Rational people will wait for the facts.  But that doesn't stop the irrational Left.  Quote "Democratic presidential candidates are already jumping on the issue.   Howard Dean called Halliburton "a special interest contributor that is overcharging taxpayers" and Dick Gephardt charged that Cheney's former employer is "bilking the taxpayers."

Yes, Halliburton is profiteering in Iraq — will apologists finally concede the point, now that a Pentagon audit finds overcharging? And reports suggest a scandal in Bechtel's vaunted school-repair program.   Me: If you were so inclined, you could play a drinking game using the words 'cronies', 'Halliburton', and 'plan' whenever you read a NYT Op-Ed segment.  Don, you probably shouldn't play right now.  As for the overcharging 'scandal', I will have to look into it since this is the first I've heard.  Same for Bechtel.  I'll get back to you with what I find.

Though she "broke into tears several times while trying to explain" the allure of the Dean campaign, Popper managed to convey that she was first attracted to Dean based on his policy of having a state social worker visit every new mother in Vermont (not to be confused with the Arkansas policy from the 1980s in which the governor would visit every woman who was hoping to become pregnant). Not that I'm trying to privatize anything here, but in my home state of Connecticut, a new mother is traditionally visited by her own mother.

"One very prominent Southern Democrat, who asked not to be identified, said of Howard Dean, "This guy will take us down like the Titanic. ""  I, for one, am looking forward to a Dean candidacy.  I couldn't have selected a more appropriate candidate for the Left, other than maybe Big Al Sharpton.  (Imagine that campaign season for a moment...)  Herbert: The Dems may indeed sink like the Titanic next year. But I don't think Dr. Dean is the problem — at least, not yet. The problem is the party itself. God and the Republicans have blessed the Democrats with the high ground on one important issue after another, from the war in Iraq to national economic policy to health care to education to the environment.  But like the Union general George McClellan, the Democrats have been too timid to take full advantage. It's a party for the faint of heart. The Republicans are hijacking elections and redistricting the country and looting the Treasury and ignoring the Constitution and embittering our allies, while the Democrats are — let's see, fumbling their way through an incoherent primary season and freaking out over Al Gore's endorsement of Howard Dean.  Me: It is funny when the Left claims that they haven't been angry enough.  How much more combatative can they get?  Dean goes on TV and accuses Bush of knowing about 9/11 ahead of time.  They block the federal judges with impunity.  The grass roots activists are advocating presidential assassination.  But they aren't combative enough?  Herbert: The strongest ticket might be Dean-Clark. But the Democrats need more than a candidate or two. The party needs a plan.   Me:  I love this 'plan fetish' on the Left.  They always must have a 'plan', or George Bush has no 'plan'.  I saw an article yesterday where John Conyers from Michigan wants to see Howard Dean's 'plan' for ending Child Poverty.  How does one END poverty anyway?  I think their plan is to use the word 'Halliburton' as often as possible and pretend it is a policy statement.  "Dr. Dean, why should we elect you?"  "Halliburton".  "Pardon me?"  "Halliburton, and Dick Cheney's cronies...."  So bring on the good doctor and lets get the the campaign.  We can wager on whether we shall witness another Mondale or Dukakis.

The law bans ads that mention a candidate or issue 60 days before a general election.  Ponder that for a moment: it is now illegal to engage in speech within a proscribed window of time.  Speech has been criminalized by federal statute.    If the amount of money in politics is disturbing to so many, the only reasonable way to eliminate it is to remove the amount of politics in money, or as George Will says, 'the importance of government in allocating wealth and opportunity'.  Money flows into politics because of the profound effect a politician can have on our well being, or the ability of a company to conduct business unfettered.  Witness the hit put out on Microsoft when Gates refused to pony up donations to either party.  A limited government would cure the importance of issue advocacy, and the instinct to appease politicians who can destroy your life on a whim.  So SCOTUS has decided that contributions cannot be made to organziations who seek to express opinions on policy.  In a strange fantasy, they seek to decouple the legislation of policy from election outcomes.  Where else in the world has the government determined that we cannot discuss candidates or policy with each other before we go to the polls to make decisions on candidates and policy?  Does that strike anyone else as odd, if not chilling?  In the 1999-2000 cycle, $3 billion dollars was spent on all Federal Elections by the candidates.  For that money, we chose 435 members of the House and 34 Senators, not to mention a President.  In that same span of two years, the American people spent $6 billion on chewing gum.  Money is like water.  If it is dammed up, it will find new paths.  All the campaign laws will accomplish is the invention of new, creative ways to finance speech, and in many instances, we will loose the transperency of the current system.  Donation disclosure was working just fine, as anyone could determine who gave how much to whom.  That is why we have newspapers - to keep track of these things and point them out.  Now, with this abomination in place, the do-gooders who insists that money corrupts have lost the ability to monitor the new channels of cash that will spring up, seeping around the McCain-Feingold dam and eroding new channels in propriety.  That is the NY Times dream.  Being a newspaper, they are exempt from the restriction of commenting on elections.  They love restricting others access to the public, while they will be happy to preach to the same public about why the Workers Party is the way to go.    The ultimate dream is public financing.  The Left would love to create a situation where all candidates must only accept money from the government, subject to government determination as to what can be said, and when. As for those that wish to speak out on an issue; our lot is to eat cake and shut up.  We will accept what we are told to accept, and we will be prevented from discussing it under penalty of prison.  First Amendment?  You misunderstand it's meaning.  Instead of the elegant and simple "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech", we now have: "Congress ... may adopt reasonable regulations of funds expended, including contributions, to influence the outcome of elections, provided that such regulations do not impair the right of the public to a full and free discussion of all issues and do not prevent any candidate for elected office from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy."  You want to try to figure out the definitions of 'reasonable', 'full and free discussion' and 'necessary'?  They can mean whatever those in power wish them to mean, and those definitions will be as fluid as 'necessary' to assure the definers own survival.  The decision on SCOTUS was 5-4, with Rehnquist, Thomas, Scalia, and Kennedy in dissent.  The usual cast of Leftists freaks made up the majority (Stevens, Souter, Ginsberg, Breyer) along with the worst mistake ever made by Reagan - O'Connor.  May they all rot.  Scalia, as always, says it best -  "The first instinct of power is the retention of power, and under a Constitution that requires periodic elections, that is best achieved by the suppression of election-time speech."

It should illustrate much when one considers that the UN is the organization to which the Left seeks to hand over the entire operation.  These are the people who are going to 'fix' the situation when we failed?  These are the people who can undertake the task with more competance than us?  When are we going to accept the reality that is the UN, and either demand serious reforms, dissolve the body and start over, or at the least, withdraw our support and money?  Pathetic.

       urlLink A Day That Will Not Live in Infamy, by The Plaid Adder - Democratic Underground    I can't let this pathetic hysteria go by.  Read the whole column if you really want a full taste of dementia.  Adder: "In Afghanistan, American forces this weekend found the bodies of nine children, after U.S. air attacks on a location where a suspected terrorist was hiding. A U.S. military spokesman in Afghanistan says the terrorist was also killed in Saturday's raid. NPR's Emily Harris joins us on the line from Kabul..."   And so the first words out of my mouth on December 7, 2003, are "Oh, Jesus."   Me: Fine and dandy.  I was horrified as well, but my first instinct is not to blame the US.  I don't believe we would do such a thing if we had the full picture of what was going on down there on the ground.  But of course, the Leftist assumes the pilots laughed at the thought of all those kids they are about to slaughter.  Adder: It only came to anyone's attention at NPR because the victims were children. And eventually, I too will forget what happened Sunday morning in the coming weeks as some other cluster of deaths pushes it out of my mind. Reports of American casualties come out punctually once a day with a nightmarish sameness; it's as if the same two American soldiers keep getting blown up over and over and over again. Meanwhile we all know the story of the Afghan raid that went awry; we've heard it many, many times before. We have heard it so often that we have stopped asking what you might think would be sensible questions, such as...   &#8226; Was it really necessary to use air power to apprehend a single individual?   &#8226; Isn't the war in supposed to be over? So why are we still bombing?   &#8226; Is it ethically, morally, or even practically defensible to kill nine people in order to take out a single human "target"?   &#8226; Does anyone in America still care whether anything we are doing with our military is ethically or morally defensible?   Me:  Funny, the use of words.  'the same two American soldiers keep getting blown up'.  I'm sure it is unconscious, but it reveals a bias by sayingthe soldiers are the one's getting blow up.  Not that bad people are blowing them up - no, they are the ones 'getting' blown up.    As for the bullet points.  Was it really NECESSARY to use air power to apprehend a single individual?  Would she prefer we dispatch troops over desolate lands, hours away, to arrive and not find the suspect?  Would she accept a lower efficiency, just to avoid bombs?  The military has already admitted a mistake was made.  It is terribly sad, but it was an accident.  Isn't the war supposed to be OVER?  So why are we still bombing?  This is the typical infantile response of the Left, taunting Bush for declaring an end to major hostilities.  It is irrational to assume that the entire region has been pacified.  Minor operations will continue.  Prosecuting these thugs is not an admission that the war continues in full force.  Is it ethically, morally or even PRACTICALLY defensible to kill nine people in order to take out a single human "target"?  Again with the hyperbole.  However, I would answer 'yes' under the right circumstances.  If a thug is surrounded by his own family, then regrettably, there comes a time to take him out.  If that same thug has taken hostages, of course you do what you can, but at the same time, the end result MUST be the death of said thug, regardless of the cost.  These aren't Americans, and perhaps it sounds racist, but our first priority is out own safety.  I hate to see it, but I'd rather see this if it prevents a major attack in the future.  Does anyone in America still care whether anything we are doing with our military is ethically or morally defensible?  In whose eyes?  I think we are morally justified for anything we have done so far.  Just because we have a difference in opinion over what is moral or ethical, you cannot label all actions in terms of absolute evil.  Many feel as I do - that we are doing the right thing here.  To presume you have a lock on morality is the height of the same arrogance you try to pin upon us.  Adder: But you know what, I am sick of the policy argument. I am sick of the fact that as far as you can tell from listening to the pundits, the talking heads, the reporters and the governmental mouthpieces, once you get outside America, human life is not worth a thing - unless you can somehow make the case that protecting that human life will ultimately benefit Americans. I am sick of the fact that our government has simply assumed - and my fellow Americans by and large have simply accepted - that we have a permanent and unrestricted license to kill. Anyone, anywhere, any number of people, any time it's convenient for us.   Me: Sorry you are so sick, but there is some truth here that needs to be confronted.  To Americans, American life IS worth more than a non-American life.  That is just and true.  It is a consequence of our morals, and our community.  From a legal perspective, it is a consequence of our Constitution.  Our leaders and military have a duty to value American life over all others.  Of course we take great pains to protect all life.  What other nation in history has done as much good with their military as we have?  How many other nations go to war to feed people?  Yes, it is in our best interests, but it also conforms to our values of life and freedom, including the life and freedom of non-Americans.  When push comes to shove, the American is valued more.  That is the case overseas.  Each and every Iraqi soldier killed in the war was valued less than an American soldier, despite the fact that the majority were decent people trying to survive between the US Marines and Saddam's butchers.  Sad, but we acted appropriately.    Adder: This attitude is the logical result of the doctrine of "preventive war," which posits that we are allowed to strike anyone we identify as a potential threat to us - whether or not that presumption is reasonable. If the self-defense standard in American courtrooms was that lax there would never be another homicide conviction. All the defendant would have to do would be to say that he perceived that the victim was threatening him.   Me: Again, the Leftist reveals the primary difference between them and us.  To them, 9/11 was a CRIMINAL act, to be prosecuted by men in suits in courtrooms.  To the normal American, who does not need to weight the nuance of what happened, 9/11 was an act of WAR, to be prosecuted under a different set of rules.  They still don't get that.    Adder: Why have we accepted the fact that we drink the blood of our kindred with our morning coffee, and taste the ashes of our neighbors' burning homes when we sit down to dinner with the 6:00 news? Why have we forgotten that national boundaries are imaginary, that as human beings we are all part of the same extended family, and that when all this is over we will all have to live with each other?   Me: Kum-ba-yah, m'Lord....Kum-ba-yah.  I feel like I should be holding hands around a campfire.    The rest is just more drivel.  She makes no mention of her solution, but I'm sure it is pulling the soldiers out, letting chaos descend, and address it through Kucinich's Department of Peace (Cleveland still must answer for Kucinich).

      Don Barda took time out to watch Battlestar Galactica.  I am pleased to think he did so at my urging, so if that is not the case, don't tell me, Don.  Here are his comments:  Love it. What a great mini-series. I like how Boomer and Starbuck are women, the relationships. The decisions to let people die the emotions between  father and son. Baltar rocks, his unwittingly helping the Cylons was a great twist from the original. The galactica bring a museum ship was kinda corny but nothing is perfect. I do miss the brown leather jackets those were cool (always wanted one).  If this becomes a series which it sounds like it will I hope they breing back the motorcycles from when the reached earth. I had no expectations  about the series, never checked out any websites, but other SciFi movies were pretty disapointing like, shit what was it Children of Dune that  sucked. I'm enjoying this very much. I think the comercials over so later for now. Oh by the way finished shogun great read try it.   End email.  I didn't watch part II last night, since I was taping 24 and Diane was watching 24 upstairs.  I taped the 11 PM showing and will watch it tonight with no distractions.  I'm really looking forward to this, and I hope they didn't disappoint me.  And glad to hear you finished Shogun.  What's next?  Has anyone seen The Last Samauri yet?

       urlLink My Way News   Gore endorses Howard Dean.  This is really huge in so many ways.  First, in my opinion, it cements the Bush landslide in 2004.  Dean is the weakest in the head to head polls against Bush, and his boiling anger and hatred of Bush will not play well with the moderate swing voters.  True, Dean fires up the liberal base, but that is really a problem, as the true liberal core of the Democratic party is only about 10-15% of registered Democratic voters.  He appeals to the hatemongers of the Democratic Underground, which is a good thing for Bush.  This also unmasks good old 'centrist' Gore as a raving leftist looney.  If he cannot understand the debacle that is Howard Dean, then he is a prisoner to ideology over practicality.  We will go down in great gouts of principled flame.  I welcome it.  On another point, how does it feel to be Joe Leiberman?  Loyal to the end, even deferring to Gore during his present campaign.  Joltin' Joe said he would step aside if Gore decided to run, and here is his payment for all of that loyalty.  Leiberman is hated by his own party as a centrist democrat, and now betrayed by his running mate.  I think Joe's party left him behind as they lurch to the Left.  Finally, Gore has stuck his thumb in the eye of the Clinton power machine.  Wesley Clark is the Clinton candidate, and by straying from the plantation, Gore has declared his independence from the Clinton machine.  Dean has been a vocal critic of the DNC leadership, all hand-picked by the Felon-in-Chief.  Terry MacAullife won't have a job in a few months, and that is probably good for the Democrats as a whole.  I'm sure Hillary is rooting for a Democratic loss to clear the way for her 2008 run, but she still needed her people in charge of the party.  Now if Dean goes down in flames, pulling the party into the abyss while putting his own people in charge, the task for Hillary becomes more difficult.  Yes, this endorsment is sending shockwaves through the political landscape.  It's like kicking over an anthill.  BUt in the end, I think I'm going to get what I'm dreaming of: a Dean-Bush matchup.

      Battlestar Galactica.  How many of you remember this series from 1978?  I don't recall much more than the fact that I loved in back then, but I was eight.  So when I heard that Sci-Fi is going to remake it, I am curious but afraid.  Afraid because many of the 'Made for Sci-Fi' movies that I've seen are mostly unwatchable after the first few minutes.  Afraid because of certain rumors passed on to me from Steve, like the Cylon's being women with glowing red spines.  Shudder....  But I dutifully set up the computer to 'tape' it, and then troll through the internet to try to recall who was in the original.  I did manage to catch part of an original episode on Sci-Fi last weekend, as they try to build enthusiasm for the new series.  The show did not age well at all, and I quickly turned the channel when Diane came into the room, to avoid embarrasment when the little motorized pet dog ambled on to the screen.  That was a disaster, and an early example of why cute kids and cute dogs are death to any scene.  The original only aired for one season, which surprised me to discover.  They cancelled it when it was #1 in the ratings, because it was far too expensive to produce.  Imagine that!  But I do remember the special effects, for 1978 technology, as being first rate.  So there is precious little of a story line that has been explored beyond the first 22 episodes.  Enough of the old stuff.  How was the new stuff?  Well, I set up to tape, and then flipped it on upstairs to keep an eye on it while I unpacked.  I wasn't really focused on it for the first twenty minutes or so, but surprisingly, it sucked me in.  After the first fourty minutes, I was trying to time all of my unpacking activities around commercials, running to get another box from the garage and trying to make it last until the next commercial.  I was really intrigued by what I was seeing.  If you are too young to recall the original plot, let me summarize.  The story is an allegory to the Diaspora of the Jews.  Humanity lives on twelve colonies, and the people refer to themselves as Colonials.  The twelve worlds represent the twelve tribes of Israel.  In thier past, they created artificial beings called Cylons (pronounced psy-lons).  Inevitably, as is demanded by standard plotting, the Cylons rebelled and great, costly wars were fought.  In this new version, the Cylons left the human part of space about fourty years ago, after an armistace granting them their freedom.  The show starts with the Cylons coming back to finish the job of exterminating the humans.  After knocking off the humans, the Galactica assembles a 'rag tag' fleet of whatever they can find, and set out with the humans in a wagon train to rediscover the lost thirteenth tribe that supposedly settled on Earth.  I don't know if the new series will take that route.  Battlestar Galactica is one of many capital warships in the human fleet.  The show starts with the Galactica being decomissioned and transformed into an exhibit on the Cylon wars.  The Commander, Adama (played by Edward James Olmos) is a gruff old man, weary and ready to retire.  He has a son who flies a Viper fighter in the fleet, and another son who also flies a fighter but was killed.  Oh, and I don't agree with Steve that the Viper's are a 'rip-off' from Star Wars X-Wings.  About the only resemblence is in the fuselage, and to draw a comparison is like saying that all commercial airliners are copies because they all have wings.  Some things must be common.  I'm sure Steve will flame away, so by all means....  Anyway, Adama has a fear and loathing of computer technology.  I didn't catch this part, but I think he fears becoming vulnerable to machines.  I don't know if this had something to do with the Cylon wars or if he is just a Luddite.  Of course, it ends up being a powerful strength.  When the Cylons return, they are very adept at shutting down the human computer systems, rendering all the modern ships helpless in the face of the assault.  The Galactica still retains a lot of manual systems, which gives it an edge for the moment, at least until the Cylons adapt.  That is the general plot.  There are many little sub-plots and character threads through the two hours I saw.  There have been some notable changes.  Captain 'Apollo' Adama, the son of the Commander, is angry and bitter over his brother's death, and blames his father.  The character of 'Starbuck' is now a woman.  And 'Boomer', who used to be a black man, is now an asian woman.  Very little of the original character relationships remain, which is really a good thing because this seems so much better.  We don't see TV style emoting, where everyone is cool and collected.  The characters are scared out of their minds, and are doing the best they can under pressure.  I was pleased at the possibilities that remain should the series continue to run.  As for particulars.  The Cylons are still mechanical.  CGI, but very cool looking with the red oscillating light in their faceplate.  Yes, there is a hot female Cylon, but she is designed to infiltrate human society and get information, which dictates her form.  Yes, her spine did glow during sex, but I can forgive that.  We did not see much of the Cylon fleet yet, but what we did see is stylish, deadly and menacing.  Much better than the old style.  As for the attack on the humans, I have to say they did a great job by NOT showing many things.  In the original, we saw a Battlestar get blow to shreds, and some pathetic strafing runs of Cylon ships on the human cities.  Here, we get nuclear detonations aplenty.  There is a scene where Dr. Gaius Baltar (who is destined to throw his lot in with the Cylons as the ultimate Judas) in his house on the lake, far from the cities.  He is coming to the realization of what is happening.  As he talks to his house guest, great flashes of light begin punctuating the scene as distance weapons detonate.  The deep thumps of detonation rest beneath the dialogue, creating a tense atmosphere.  Later, we are looking down from orbit as the weapons continue to detonate.  It was chilling.    As for the rest of the battle, we don't see many minutes of redundant footage, showing small fighter action, or great burning Battlestars trying to gather their defenses.  Instead, we see flashes of destruction on the planet, and we see the crew of the Galactica gathering the news as they try to figure out how to convert a museum piece into a fighting ship.  The characterization is vital to the story, and the camera stayed with the characters as they tried to assimilate the end of the world.  Well done.  The fighting scenes that we did see were very well done.  One of my biggest beefs with Sci-Fi, and this includes Star Wars (which isn't Sci-Fi), lies in the way small ships fight: swooping and spinning like aerial dogfights.  Rubbish.  I was pleased to see the ships in Galactica act more like real spaceships.  They don't swoop and fly.  Every action is initiated by a thruster, and the little spurts of propellent really enhance the action.  I liked the little detail.  Also, the CGI camera work in the battles was very well done.  There are shots that almost look like they were filmed with a hand camera.  In one example, we see a profile of the Galactica, burning after an attack.  The camera shakes a bit and zooms in quickly, partially catching a Viper fighter in frame.  The frame moves as if someone is trying to center the shot, and we see the blurry Viper racing along the Galactica's flank.  The image looks smudged, just like you would see if you tried to watch a jet overhead through binoculars.  There are many shots like that, and they add a real sense of distance, scale and speed to the combat scenes.    And I liked the stylings of the uniforms.  They aren't flashy, but they have a ceremonial appearence to them.  Not the drap utilitarian unitards of Star Trek.  Really, they are more like the Imperial officer uniforms of Star Wars, but not a direct copy.  I've always been partial to the idea that space 'naval' officers should have more Victorian style uniforms, at least in the ceremonial appearance.  See 'A Mote in God's Eye' as a book reference of the type of navy I would like to see.  So overall, I was very impressed, and I need to watch it again with more focus, to be sure I got everything.  If this continues as a mini-series, I'll schedule around it, to be sure I can see it 'live' rather than taped.    If you have no memory of the original, or were too young, I don't recommend going out of your way to see it.  If you have the chance to watch this on Sci-Fi, take the time.  It will probably be re-broadcast a billion times in the next week since they sunk so much money into it.  It is nice to see some quality television.  In my view, 99% of Science Fiction on film or screen is utter Dreck.  True Sci-Fi has little to do with special effects or cool concepts all by themselves.  The heart of Science Fiction is man's reaction and adjustment to technology and change.  It is the focus on how man adjusts to knowledge, and how man remakes himself into something different.  Character is king in Sci-Fi, but far too many media people get hung up on splash and effect over character and development.  Witness the things such as the T2, which is not Sci-Fi so much as it is a simple action movie (very well done, yes, but not really science fiction in the strictist sense).  Or Star Wars, which is really Space Opera as the technology is a mere prop to the character story.  Don't get me wrong though, just because Star Wars is not really Sci-Fi, it is still a terrific story as it touches upon so many bedrock themes of literature.  I don't know if Galactica will stay true to Science Fiction, but it has the potential if it sticks to the characters as the focus.

      An interesting article on the Pfizer News Service this morning.  Probably only interesting to me, but here goes anyway.  WSJ:Cost Of Developing A New Drug Increases To About $1.7 Billion    By Peter Landers The Wall Street Journal, December 08, 2003  The amount of money that drug companies must spend to bring a single drug to market has risen to about $1.7 billion because of a higher percentage of failures during trials, according to a study by the consulting firm Bain & Co.  Many companies are living on borrowed time until their blockbuster patents run out, says the Bain study. It warns that big pharmaceutical companies may face the same fate as the steel industry in the 1970s unless they change their strategy of gambling on high-risk products.  The average investment required to get one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed in the U.S. has risen to about $1.7 billion if one extrapolates from spending by drug companies on the various stages of research and development during the 2000-2002 period, according to the study. That's up from $1.1 billion from 1995-2000, when clinical trials cost less and drug companies were more productive in finding drugs.  A widely cited 2001 study by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development put the cost of bringing a new drug to market at $802 million. Because of different methodology, the $1.7 billion figure can't be directly compared with the Tufts figure, said Preston Henske, a co-author of the Bain study. Among other things, the Bain study includes commercialization costs, such as preparing marketing materials, which weren't included in the Tufts study.  According to Bain's analysis, for every 13 drugs that start out in animal testing, only one now makes it to market. That figure is down from one in eight during the 1995-2000 period.  The Bain consultants say drug companies are earning only a 5% return on their investment in finding new drugs, below levels typically demanded by equities investors. Licensing products from other companies, which was a profitable strategy until recently, is now bringing only a 6% return on investment, they say. "The prices for that kind of deal have shot way up," Mr. Henske said.  Large drug companies have designed themselves around the promotion of blockbuster products for widespread ailments such as heartburn, high  cholesterol and depression. But many of those products are losing patent protection and being replaced by cheap generics.  The Bain study predicts that the companies won't abandon the blockbuster model easily, comparing the drug industry to the steel industry in the 1970s, which clung to aging plants and an expensive work force. In subsequent decades, many steel companies went bankrupt.  The Bain consultants recommend that companies focus on a few areas of strength rather than trying to cover all diseases and think about outsourcing more functions, such as manufacturing, even if that requires big layoffs. They also suggest that drug companies think about emulating International Business Machines Corp., the computer maker that reinvented itself in the 1990s as a more services-oriented organization.

       Thoughts on DVD Box Sets   This is from a bit of email going around talking about the recent crop of DVD box sets. As usual, the media companies put out many sets for DVDs for Xmas.  James bond collections-  Though the time wasted may be unfathomable to some, it has been accomplished by me. I have watched all Bond movies whithin the past year. Most with commentary tracks. Goldfinger reigns supreme, and the recent Bonds are feces except Goldeneye. From Russia With Love has the single best "real" fight ever. Bond has to fight the Spectre assassin, Grant, on the Orient Express. Looks great, as Bond barely wins. I don't know why, but the current crop of Bond movies just have no heart. They lack the special something that makes a Bond movie special. They're just paint-by-numbers attempts at prolonging the "franchise." Die Another Day is the worst Bond movie of all time. Worse even than Diamonds are Forever, which I detest. My reasons are many and vaired, but I have a feeling it is because this is he most 70's Bond of them all.  If I had to rank the Bonds, I would do so in this order:  1. Goldfinger 2. Moonraker 3. For Your Eyes Only (best babe) 4. From Russia With Love 5. The Spy Who Loved Me 6. Goldeneye 7. The Living Daylights 8. License to Kill 9. A View to a Kill 10. The Man With the Golden Gun 11. Octopussy 12 You Only Live Twice 13. Tomorrow Never Dies 14. Live and Let Die 15. Thunderball 16. On Her Majesty's Secret Service 17. The World is Not enough 18. Diamonds are Forever 19. Dr. No 20. Die Another Day  Admittedly, some of the middle selections are faily equal, but the top and bottom of the list are definite. If someone hasn't seen a Bond movie, Goldfinger or The Spy Who Loved Me might be the best inros. They contain nearly every element of Bond. The only problem with Goldfiner is Pussy Galore, a misnomer if there ever was one. She actually manages to make lesbians un-sexy! But other than that, the film is complete. I may have to waste more web space discussing each movie in turn. That might be fun (for me)!  It was a moment of insanity that caused me to buy the second wave of 2 boxes. Best Buy (satan) had this crazy $30 off if you bought 2 sets, and I had a 15% off DVDs coupon that neded to be used. To carp, the one with the 7 DVDs has no freaking English Subtitles on ANY of the DVDs! This must be because they rushed them out the door or something. An inexcusable omission! If I could, I would demand a refund. But because I could be a pirate and must be forced to eat the shit I purchased no matter the taste, I cannot get a refund. Yes, this does make me mentally unstable, but subtitles are a necessity! Think of how terrible it is to have a commentary track that drowns out the spoken dialogue of the movie, and no subtitle track to help out. That's the situation on these movies.   Besides this egregious omission, the movies are very well done on DVD, and you certainly get value for your money. Bond is a classic, and a part of the Western culture. The movies are progenitors of the modern action and adventure genres. Buy them if you are interested, but stay far away if the idea of Bond bores you.  The Star Trek boxen are for rich fools. $100 per season!? At least that is an improvement on their Original releases. 2 episodes per DVD!? $20 each? Insane. I watched a bit of DS9, and I enjoyed TNG when it was new, but both are utter shite compared with the Second Coming that is B5. Though I haven't seen the last season and a half of B5 yet...  SG1 is pretty good, it has some really interesting stories occasionally. The Stargaqte concept is perfect for TV, as the episodic nature can be utlilized by the conceit of visiting different worlds each week. It really does take what was good in the movie (not much, admittedly) and expand upon it. My mother was the one who actually got me interested. I don't particularly like the direction it has taken in recent years, but the first 4 seasons are pretty solid. The commentary on S3 and S4 are simply the best I have ever heard on any Sci-Fi. This one director is one of the funniest people I can think of. I'd love to know him in real life.  Don't forget the Simpsons DVD sets! I can't recommend them highly enough! Great extras. Futurama is required by all who would make claim to geekhood. It is the smartest comedy I have seen in a long, long while. It was indeed too good for network TV. Fox killed it by pre-empting it, showing it irregularly, and not putting it in a proper timeslot. That being directly following the Simpsons. Why Malcolm in the Middle is still around must remain a mystery. Perhaps the only explanation for that lies in the famous lack of good taste of the American public.  Indiana Jones Box Set. A fairly solid release, with subtitles! No director or cast commentary, but that's because Spielburg is a snobbish bastard who can rot in Hell for all I care! But I guess if he thinks his insight is worthless, who are we to ask for it? The transfers are well done here, and some work was done to remove poor special effects artifacts. A good deal for almost everyone, since these three movies appeal to the entire population of the USA. I have yet to meet someone who detests Indiana Jones.   Raiders is one of the 5 best movies ever, in my opinion. It is on my list of things that must be experienced by any person interested in friendship. Raiders is a part of me, as few films can be. I do not watch it much at all, but just as with Star Wars, it is because I do not have to. The memory is strong enough. Part of me bought the set just as nostalgia, to have some tangible link to my memory. At $45 for all 3 films it was a good deal. The bonus disc is nice, but not worth exitement.  Temple of Doom is an OK movie, and better than many would have you believe. While it is no Raiders, it is a solid tale of adventure and really stretches its Pg-13 rating with the Temple and its demonic inhabitants. This one gave me nightmares when I was a child.  The Last Crusade. I'm not sure what to think of it. While I know it was a crass attempt at money-making, I did enjoy it. Perhaps this is what franchise pictures should be like? Where we recieve what we expect and just a little more, while happily handing over money for the experience? While this movie isn't brilliant, it is probably better than Temple. It does seem a bit too playful and comical though. The villains are bufoonish, and the heroes become caricatures of themselves. It's a truly mixed experience for me.  As an aside, I have been spending far too much money on anime (Japanese animation) DVDs lately. If anyone actually reads this blog, and cares to learn about anime, please mail me.

       Some Comment From Mike on Rush   I think Rush is still the same person he always was. I do think the perception of his misdeeds will diminish him though. Even if he has done nothing more than acquire quantities of painkillers and withdraw large sums of cash from his bank, the accusations will hurt him.   Why is it that we require perfect exemplars of those who would forward some moral code? It seems to be an instinct, some sort of ingrained reaction. Why must the man follow the mission perfectly? Would we react the same if one of our enemies did the same things Rush is accused of doing? If Dean was revealed to have done the exact same thing, I honestly would say, "Figures." But when Rush does it I am appalled.  Personally, I see nothing wrong with Rush's actions. But many do, and it is this perception that hurts both Rush and his cause.   I don't think Rush is a hypocrite. He is misunderstood much of the time though. He admits to his wrongdoing, as he should have not succumbed to painkillers. But he chose to do so, and now he must deal with the consequences. This is in stark contrast to many on the Left, who only make excuses for bad behavior. It is never the fault of the one who does the deed, he is always somehow innocent. If Rush has broken the law, he must be punished. So what if the law is unjust? It is the law, and if we do not submit to the rule of law then why even have a society?  I wish that what people would take out of this is the realization that drugs should be legal. What Rush did is not wrong, but illegal. His "crime" was to put into his body something that other people say he shouldn't. How does that hurt anyone? Who is the victim here? Being offended by someone's behavior is not something to be made illegal. And yet we seek to do that all the time. I see no difference between Rush's behavior and that of a crack addict. Both are to be pitied, but not to be punished. Their "crimes" hurt no one but themselves. No one can own someone else's behavior! If we can tell adults what they can put in themselves, why not tell them where they can work? Who they can marry? What they can say? It is a slippery slope when you take away someone's rights.   Anyhow, to sum it up, Rush will be damaged forever by this, but mostly because people do not approve of his exercise of his freedom. He is not a hero, but a victim of an unjust law. He would suffer enough punishment without any legal repercussions added to them.

      Since I actually had to do some work to research this, I'm going to post it.  Mark asked how could Al Sharpton be allowed to host SNL this weekend without triggering the equal time clause for public candidates.  Here is my reply.  There are five exceptions to the equal time clause - Newscasts, on the spot breaking news, documentaries, political conventions, and news interviews.   But:  If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station: Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provisions of this section.   Since SNL is 'censoring' the content by scripting the sketchs and the monologue, and they are not 'campaigning' in the sense of advocating policy issues, they are clear.  If they gave Al an open forum to speak as he wished for an amount of time, then it becomes a campaign, and the clause is triggered.  Shows like Leno have been categorized as News Interviews, so the Gropenator can get on there and say whatever he wishes without triggering an equal time rule.  I don't believe that the airing of Ahnuld films in CA would have triggered this clause, but they pulled them anyway.

       urlLink Fanning Rwanda?s Genocide   Pay attention, because I'm going to come out in favor of advocating genocide.  Sound like fun?  Do you all remember the Rwanda situation back in 1997?  The slaughter of the Tutsi tribe while the world paid little attention?  Where was the UN?  Anyway, the UN International Court has convicted three media figures for 'hate speech', expanding the concept of hate speech to the level of a war crime.  Decisions like this are the very reasons why I think the UN is one of the greatest threats to our way of life.  We value our freedom as a God given right.  That extends to the freedom of associate, and the freedom to think or belief however we choose.  Those freedoms are sacred, and for a very good reason.  But there is a strong inclination on the Left to criminalize free thought.  We have 'hate crime' legislation here in the States, and it is my hope that someday these laws are struck down for the monstrosities that they are.  How can you make it a crime to think?  How can you demand that people think a certain way?  Fortunately, we at least have the comfort that the thought element of a hate crime can only be triggered in conjunction with a physical crime, but given the precedent of this UN ruling, that line will be crossed in a short time.  The very premise of a hate crime violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.  Say that I am walking down the street with my Black, Gay, Cross Dressing Friend.  We'll call him Mike.  A truckload of rednecks pull up and proceed to beat us both senseless.  All the while, they are casting slurs upon Mike for being Black, Gay and wearing a dress.  Well, under the hate crime legislation, they now become eligible for a harsher sentence.  Meanwhile, I'm just a white guy who got beat up.  Mike has received an unequal amount of protection, and we have made a crime out of some person's opinion of Mike's status as a human being.  Rubbish.  The fictional Mike has no right to be loved by all, and he certainly has no right to exist free of hateful opinions.  But the moment someone harms him, then a crime has been committed, just as it has been committed against me.  We are equal human beings, and the very fact that we have been assaulted is reason enough for prosecution.  We have laws against harming people.  We do not need laws against harming minorities.  By making a crime of thought, we are removing the freedom of thought, and the freedom of association.  Tying this back in to Rwanda, these scumbags are being held accountable for words.  They have not been charged with hacking a random Tutsi to death, yet the UN is saying that they are responsible for the near genocide.  This is fatuous in many ways, one of which is the absolution of responsibility on the part of those that heeded these exhortations to slaughter the Tutsis.  Those wielding the machetes are the people who need to be held accountable.  While the men on the radio are indeed hatefull, evil men, it is not a crime to speak.  It is not a crime to express vile opinions.  The crimes lies with those that act.  I've heard the comparison to an officer ordering a soldier to commit a war crime.  I can't buy into that argument here.  An officer indeed has a moral responsibility for the actions of those under his command.  The leadership role establishes a cupability for whatever orders they issue.  While an SS officer may not pull the trigger, he is just as guilty as the soldier he commands.  These Rwanda media people are not leaders.  They do not have any moral responsibility for those that listen to them.  There is no bond between the populace and the media.  If the NYT advocated the slaughter of conservatives (not too much of a stretch), then those who act upon that advice cannot point to the NYT as the guilty party.  The very fact that the NYT is in favor of these convictions illustrates their agenda.  Quote -   Mr. Ngeze, Mr. Nahimana and Mr. Barayagwiza were not challenging government propaganda, exposing corruption or expanding political debate. They were organizing the brutal physical extermination of a whole people.   Me - So the NYT makes it clear.  So long as a media figure is focused on activities deemed worthy be the elitists, then they should be left alone.  Who has the arrogance to determine what forms of speech should be made criminal?  And where does it stop?  The term Hate Speech has already recently been attached to proposals to reform welfare, or to hold minorities to the same standards as the majority.  Do we really want to go down this road?  Genocide is an easy target to come out against.  It doesn't take much effort to convict these men for being bastards.  However, the easy path leads to an erosion of our rights and freedoms.  The UN has set a horrible example here, and it continues to illustrate why it is a terrible threat to our way of life.

       urlLink Travel Channel :: Travel Channel   A current obsession.    If you have not seen the World Poker Tour on the Travel Channel, make time to watch it once or twice.  I cannot believe how completely, utterly and hopelessly addicted I am to Texas Hold 'Em.  The only thing this compares to is my addiction to Magic back in 1998.  It is such a simple game, but the possibilities are overwhelming, and most of the game happens outside of the cards.  My brother Mark turns out to be a poker fiend, probably playing more than is healthy.  But I envy him for that.  We played this past weekend in Toledo, with our dad and uncle.  For the record, Mark took all of the money.  If you are interested in screwing around with the game, I recommend www.partypoker.com for a free site to play with fake money.  You could easily loose a few hours pushing cards around.

       urlLink FOXNews.com - Politics - Report: Bush Wants Mission to the Moon   I am really conflicted on the moon proposal.    On one hand, I am an avid, rabid, hyper-advocate of space.  We must be there, and I want to see it in my lifetime for purely selfish reasons.  I can launch into long, tired prose about our destiny as explorers, and how it is in our nature to push against frontiers, but you all know this.  Our future is out there, and the sooner we embrace it, the better for all of us.  And they there are the practical consideration of the moon's resources.  Helium-3 is found in abudance there, while hardly any of it exists here.  1 kg of helium-3 burned with 0.67 kg of deuterium gives us about 19 megawatt-years of energy output.  Some He3 is available on Earth. It is a by-product of the maintenance of nuclear weapons, which would supply us with about 300 kg of He3 and could continue to produce about 15 kg per year. There is an estimated 1.1 million metric TONS of He3 on the moon, deposited over time by the solar wind.  It would take about 24 tons of He3 to power the US for one year.  You can imagine the energy supply if we could either ship it back, or set up reactors there and beam it back down.  These are not flights of Sci-Fi.  The concepts are eastablished and practical.  So there are good reasons to go back and stay.  I think it would be worth the money.  And of course, there is the rub.  The money.  I try real hard not to be a selective conservative.  If I'm going to embrace the philosophy, I need to be consistent.  Just because I believe in the space program, I shouldn't cast aside my aversion to government theft just to please me.  Is it the government's business to finance a space program?  Does that type of activity appear in the Constitution?  One could argue about the General Welfare clause, but that way leads to the tyranny we already have today.  That clause has been used to justify mandated speed limits, farm subsidies, FCC regulations, and just about everything else indicative of a repressive government.  Does the government have the right to take money from us to spend on space?  I'm not sure they do, but no other entity exists that could tackle the enterprise.  No one has the resources to make it happen.  After much thought, this is where I've ended up.  I think the government should offer to underwrite a good portion of the enterprise, but only through a consortium of the major aerospace companies.  Boeing, Lockheed and all the others should form a seperate 'moon company' to take on the project.  The governments roll will be as a coordinator of the activity.  They will provide grants, keep the project on mission, and clear the way of federal regulation and liability laws.  They would enable the company to persue the technology.  Also, the funds that are poured into the venture must be repaid through profits.  Meaning that the company will be given full ownership to whatever technology they develop, as well as full rights to the moons resources.  Complete privitazation of the venture.  Also, the company must be publically traded, so as to allow all people to get a piece of the action.  Under those terms, I think the venture satisfies my concerns.  In terms of technology, I would like to see us throw funds at the Space Elevator.  There is no better way to acheive cheap access to space, and again, the technology is not far out Sci-Fi.  The concept is proven, the materials exist.  The only questions left are in terms of construction.  It can be done.  And if you don't know what the space elevator is, google it.  So I am excited about the possibilty of having a serious, mission oriented space program once again.  Perhaps I can find a job helping out.  That would be one way to know that my work has a purpose.

      On Rush.  As I was asked by Steve to comment on Rush, here goes.  Let me start by covering what I've already said.  I'm profoundly disappointed in him.  Perhaps my original assessment was too harsh, but I certainly am disappointed in him for allowing this to continue for the length of time it has.  No, I don't understand addiction (unless you wish to count my addiction to pizza).  I can't fathom the destructive behavior.  But I recognize my inability to not understand.  For that reason, I am tempering my initial anger against him.  As Rumsfeld would say, my understanding of addiction is a known unknown - I know I don't get it, so I have to factor that in.  I would have preferred for him to come forward after a year or so and say "I have a problem and I'm going away to fix it".  That would have been inspiring.  But again, the nature of the addiction is to deny the problem.  Okay, I get that.  But it doesn't stop me from considering my preferred outcome.  As for Rush's position as an icon of a political movement - it has been damaged.  Those that hate him don't need this to hate him, and those that are blind with devotion will forgive him nearly anything.  My concern is with those in the middle that might consider him a credible source, but are too detached to pay close attention.  In the eyes of the middle, he is just another moralizing hypocrite.  While the comparison is far too extreme, it is akin to a pedophilia priest.  Do as I say.....  So for that, I am disappointed in him.  There is another can of worms lurking within the question of the criminality of drug use.  (And where did the expression 'can of worms' come from?  Were worms onced canned?  And opening it was a bad thing?)  We could spend hours on drug legalization.  Intellectually, I think drugs should be legal.  100% legal.  And with that legality comes responsibility.  Meaning that those that harm others, or harm themselves under the influence, should receive harsh justice.  That being said, emotionally, I have a hard time with the conept of legalization.  I acknowledge this as a weakness in my philosophy.  I believe that personal responsibility is the most crucial element of a free society.  Given that, I do not believe in limits to our behavior - that is to say limits imposed by government.  So long as I do not harm anyone else, I should be free to do as I please.  If I choose to coke up and sit in my own waste for days on end, that is my choice.  And with that choice, I must accept the possibility that I will end up living at the fringes of society, no home, no job, no friends.  Should I wish to sell a Kidney, than that is my right.  Should I wish to engage in prostitution, again, that is my right provided it is a transaction between willing parties.  However, I know that this is not the case in the world we inhabit.  Personal responsibility is dead.  Should we legalize drugs, and legions of youth end up coked up with no job skills and no future, do you really think that this 'compassionate' society will allow them to die?  Will we allow the drug fiend with no insurance to bleed to death when he wraps his car around a tree?  Will we give a 50 year sentence to a DUI who harms an innocent family?  We will bear this cost.  Some will argue that this cost is already being borne in the futile war on drugs.  I agree to some extent.  We are wasting billions on this war, but in my mind, that is preferable to allowing the free wrecking of lives, only to be faced with the inevitable hand out to those who embraced the drug life.  I may be wrong, and I'm sure some will want to argue with me.  But my intellectual stance on drugs must bow to the reality we face in a culture where responsibility is a lost concept.  If we could return that concept of responsibility, then I would be completely in favor of legalization, immediately.  That being said - Limbaugh.  Like it or not, laws might have been broken.  As Ann Coulter pointed out in a recent column, Conservatives have a fetish for following the law...even bad ones.  Rush must face the music.  If the investigation reveals violations of the criminal code, then he must stand trial and go through the process, whatever that might mean.  It pains me to say this, but it is the consequence of actions....Responsibility.  As much as I love him, I would expect him to accept whatever might come through a fair process.  I recently heard him on the radio for the first time since his return, and I have to say he sounds like a new man.  He sounded like he was enjoying the show, and it seems his life has improved.  I am happy for him, and I continue to wish him happiness.  But this isn't over until he winds his way through the process.  I hope he makes it, but whatever might come, he has to see it through.

       urlLink Democratic Underground Forums - Now we know why Bush wants to go to the moon :   I'm going to be giving my thoughts on our possible return to the Moon, but first I ran across this thread on the Democratic Underground.  I can't decide if these people are serious, or someone is posting this stuff to stir up the troglodytes.  Quote:  "It can't be used enough...because the term, 'rich buddies' sums up the entire Bush presidency. His every policy is geared towards the wants of his rich friends. I'd really hate to see this craven administration take us to the moon when they are doing their damndest to pollute and destroy the earth--everything they touch turns to shit. I agree we are overdue for the moon, but I'd rather we go there to explore it, not so Bush and his rich buddies can rape it."  Me: It's all about exploitation and zero growth for these people.  They would cut off their arm to prevent any progress in energy or technology.  Funny....  My thoughts after I get back from breakfast.

       urlLink Amazon.com: DVD: Alien Quadrilogy (2003)     The most exciting DVD release in years.  Take a look at the details!  45 hours of extra footage, and each movie contains restored scenes.  Alien 3 was always my biggest disappointment.  While it is directed by Fincher (who is like a God to me), it never came together in a coherent story.  I sensed some possibilities, but they never appeared on screen.  This version restores 17 minutes, which might be crucial.    Anyway, if you are a fan of the first two Alien films, you should be aware of this.  I am insanely jealous of Mike, since he has already ordered it and the product is in shipment.

       urlLink Amazon.com: Books: Master and Commander   What I'm reading.  I just finished Quicksilver by Neal Stephenson, and I can't wait for the next book of the cycle in April.  I picked up Master and Commander after seeing the Russel Crowe film.  I've always been fascinated by the era of Tall Ships, and what it takes to fight them.  M&C was a fine movie, nothing at all like Gladiator (which was another fine movie).  It is not the action picture originally advertised.  Instead, it was an interesting look at the types of characters that lived this life.  Crowe was excellent in the role.  So I decided to tackle the entire Patrick O'Brien series of 20 novels.  We'll see how far I get.

      It's been a few weeks since I've done any serious blogging, and I think it is time that I try to get back into the routine.  I started this as a way to spout off my thoughts and ideas regarding the world, with a specific interest in politics.  I want to keep doing that, but of late I've been finding it difficult to update it each day.    Well, I've decided that continuing is worth it.  The exercise keeps my mind agile, and prevents me from sinking into a lethargy here at work.  Quite frankly, my job requires little attention from me, so it is easy to slide into a vegitative state here.  The Blog helps keep me awake and aware, so I must continue posting.  So look for more activity today.  As always, please chime in with your own thoughts.  And if anyone would like posting permission so you can add to this on your own, I have no problem with that.  Just let me know.

       urlLink Democratic Underground Forums - The End   This was an interesting DU thread that caught my eye this morning.  Another insight into the mind of the Left.  Example statements -   One of the reasons I see no reversal in this situation has to do with the way people think. At the root of this problem is the idea that "we were born in the image of god". This is the worst idea ever created by egotistical humans. Therefore we are so spendid, so special, that a being so powerful created clones of itself and gave these clones a place to live and multiply and praise the planet giver. This is all about the glory of man. So many are hypnotized by our miraculous abilities to reason, think, be aware, that they are convinced of devine intervention.   And this one -   Western religions have inspired an egotism to evolve where man believes himself worthy of his desires. This is not to say that only the religious are guilty of this behavior, or that religious people cannot be environmentalist. But the overall effect is cultural and embedded in society, and becomes the reasoning behind national political inspirations.  So I guess our destiny, in this person's view, is to live a mud farming existence, devoid of any hope to improve ourselves.  Am I reading that correctly?

      People, please watch Dennis Miller.  He's smoothing out the wrinkles and the program is working.  Aside from some good political comments, it's funny.  Last night when he was doing the news he had a monkey sitting on the desk with a button, whenever the monkey hit the button the Dean Scream played.  Hilarious.    Some other tidbits:  When Naomi Wolfe was complaining about Bush sending troops to be killed, Dennis asked her if she thought that didn't upset Bush at all.  Isn't Bush a human too?  Don't you think that those troops being killed doesn't tear him up?  Of course she had no comeback.  The other was his take on the BUSH LIED thing.  He said, I don't think it was malicious.  Bush had what he has to consider solid data from intelligence, then made a decision.  If the evidence was wrong, it was wrong, but not in a malicious cover up way.    He had an oppurtunity to trap a guy from Newsweek who was going on and on about BUSH LIED, in one tirad the man said that Bush tricked America into going into the war with Iraq, that they weren't the threat that Bush played it out.  But then later he railed that the intelligence community does not have the resources to protect us from the "threat of Al-Qeada and Iraq".  In one sentence Iraq is not a threat, yet we need to be better protected against the non-threat?  Clearly trying to have it both ways, I'm surprised Miller didn't jump on it.  Anyway, in short, try to catch it, it's turning into a great program for alternative media views.

       urlLink Wired News   Wired magazine has been one of the best finds I've discovered in quite some time.  12 issues for $10, and quality issues at that!  This particular month they have an article on outsourcing to India.  I expected a semi-Left slant on the article, as is usual for Wired, but they got it right.  They interview all of the Angry Americans, as well as the Indians that are now employed over there, and gave a pretty fair picture of what all of this really means.  The programmers sound pretty much like the angry auto union guy in 1980, railing against the Japanese, which to me is an indication that this is going to be just fine.  At one time, 80% of Americans worked in agriculture.  Today it is 3% and we still lead the world in output.  At one time, 60% of Americans worked in manufacturing.  Today it is 11% and we sill lead the world in output.  The only difference this time is that this cycle is occuring not over decades, but over the span of individuals careers.  That makes it seem more sudden and devestating.  During previous transitions, the drain occured through reduced hiring (mostly).  Today, it is through mass firings.  And I love how the Angry Americans seem to think that these jobs are American Jobs by divine right.  Or they think that capitalism can only occur in America.  Not long ago, we had to employ legions of secretaries, switchboard operators, typing pools and other clerical functions to see that everything got answered, typed, routed and scheduled.  New jobs came along and soaked up that slack labor.  It's the normal cycle.  They interviewed one state congresswoman who was a self proclaimed protectionist.  She said that the government had the mandate to stop the export of jobs.  In typical nanny state fashion, she said "As a parent, you take care of your children before you worry about the neighbors children."  I suppose she was trying to say that while India is uplifting themselves through the economic utilization of their labor pool, we still should 'take care' of our own first.  I won't bother going into the idea that somehow government has to babysit workers.  Finally, she was asked her position on the evolution of the economy.  The questioner pointed out that we went from agriculture to manufacturing, then manufacturing to knowledge.  In a breathtaking display of narrow thinking and lack of imagination, she said "I don't see where you can go from knowledge."  I guess we are at the final fronteir of employment.  Close the patent office, since there is nothing new left to invent.    Idiots.

       urlLink ABCNEWS.com : Document: Saddam Supporters Got Oil Deals   This one has been bouncing around for a few days now, but this is the first time I've seen a list of names.  It seems Saddam had been cutting lucrative contracts with Russia and France in exchange for opposition to the US led effort.  So does this make the war 'all about oil' for those that accused us of going in to seize the oil?  Does Pelosi think we still should have 'internationalized' the war?  Maybe if we offered these guys contracts on ANWAR drilling, they would have joined us and the Left would feel so much better.  Check out pages 2-4 of the story. That is the actual list of contracts (in millions of barrels of oil) let out to each individual or group.

This time he is angry because Halliburton doesn't pay enough taxes to 'give back' to the country that has been so good to them.  Once again, he goes into the 'no bid contract' that really was awarded before 9/11 for general emergency services to the Pentagon.    You know, when I have a good 'story' about corruption, no matter how juicy it might seem, occasionally the truth proves me wrong and I can't run with it.  There were a couple of Clinton scandals that ended up being false, so I dropped them from my standard arsenal of reasons why Clinton was the devil.  It seems truth has little effect on the Left.  They just keep repeating the distortion.

      I'm here for the obligatory unrelated post.  My wife told me yesterday that I was "perpetually obsessed".  That I am usually singulary obsessed with one idea or concept, and when the slightest crack or slow down appears, a new obsession leaps in and the old one is gone instantly and entirely.  And it is rare when an obsession appears twice.  Interesting.  Interesting and correct.  I wonder if this is a result of the "more info now, faster, hey, you blinked, here's some more information" culture that is producing children with attention spans that can only be measured in physics labs...   No need for comment, I am just "obsessed" with this thought today, and also thought that the phrase "perpetually obsessed" could become clinical??

       urlLink TIME Magazine: Why We Pay So Much For Drugs :   My free copy of Time showed up in the mail yesterday with a front page expose on Big Pharma and the evils of Drug pricing.  You can't read the entire article here, but you get the drift when you get to this paragraph.  "While there is no doubt that counterfeit and adulterated medicines?some potentially injurious, possibly even lethal?are sold over the Internet by unscrupulous vendors, a TIME investigation suggests the FDA's actions against Canadian imports have been part of a concerted campaign to simultaneously discredit its counterpart agency in Canada, provoke fear among American consumers who buy their drugs there, blunt an exploding political movement among local and state governments to begin wholesale drug buys in Canada and ultimately preserve the inflated prices charged U.S. consumers and taxpayers. "  Inflated prices?  Yes, it seems that Time concludes that Big Drug is gouging the American consumer.  It seems that we are striving to prevent the flow of drugs from Canada to the US, never mind the fact that we ship them to Canada in the first place.  I guess the Times discovered those vast groves of Lipitor trees growing free and wild all over the Canadian tundra, while Canadian citizens freely wander among the boughs, plucking the medication from the trees while John Lennon's 'Imagine' plays softly in the background.  Bah!

       urlLink Testing Two Leaders: George Bush, in Denial   The NYT with the predictible Op-Ed on BUSH LIED.  I am so SICK of this crap!  David Kay comes back and says "There aren't any WMDs there now.  They are probably in another country.  Records have been trashed during the last days of the war."  But all the pinheads at the NYT heard was 'There aren't any WMDS in Iraq'.    Kay said some of the intelligence was bad.  Some of the treats were overstated, but Bush acted on the data given to him, and the course of events were reasonable based upon the intel.  But that doesn't mean anything to the NYT.  BUSH LIED!!!  NYT- "Iraq destroyed its weapons and weapons programs long ago under the pressure of the same United Nations inspectors that Mr. Bush and his aides vilified in the months leading up to the war. "  Me - Then why the hell didn't Saddam present the documents to prove this destruction?  The responsibility was his to prove it.  The UN Resolution demanded an accounting of all programs.  Saddam offered no accounting.  Even if he didn't have them, he was in breach.  That is justification enough.  NYT- "No matter how he and his aides try to change the subject to how tyrannical Saddam Hussein was, it was the presence of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons in Iraq that Mr. Bush gave as his justification for rushing into a war without real international backing."  Me- Now who's lying?  The WMD issue was NOT the sole justification for going to war.  Saddam was in violation of 14 UN resolutions.  He was in violation of the Cease Fire that paused the 91 War.  He was firing at our planes.  As Kay said, he was probably engaged in WMD programs, despite the lack of evidence.  Saddam had missiles that violated UN restrictions.  He had other prohibited weapons systems such as artillery.  What more do we need?  I am so fed up with the questioning the War.  I am fed up with the lack of common sense on the part of the Left.  Does anyone with an ounce of sanity really think that Saddam was not a threat to our interests?  Do you really think that Saddam would refuse to offer aid to those that wish to kill us?    The Left is slowing constructing a straight jacket for us, and they strive to make it nearly impossible to preserve our way of life in the future.  We aren't going to be able to strike until someone nukes us, or gasses us, or infects us, or simply blows us up with conventional explosives.  Then the cries will come about how Bush failed to protect us from the folly of the Left.  The only up side to this whole scenario is that maybe the NYT building will evaporate in the fireball.  Try to see the bright side.  Let's just pull our troops back, shut the borders, and stick our fingers in our ears while humming as loud as we can.  Yes, that is the answer to all of our ills.  Obviously we are too evil and corrupt to have a right of self-preservation.

But I'm unsure how to proceed, and I'd like to get my facts straight before I speak with an advisor over there and reveal my ignorance.  The question is, since I have a degree already, am I required to attend as a Graduate Student?  Or is my degree even relevent since it isn't anything like English?  Ideally, I'd like to simply take English courses with a focus on writing.    Anyone know anyone with Grad school experience and how it works?

      New Hampshire primary is complete, and it is increasingly obvious that John Friggen Kerrey is starting to walk away from the pack.  Fortunately, even with Dean's lackluster second place, he is still alive in this campaign.  Mike thinks that Dean's showing will force Kerry to tack to the left, but I don't think that is true just yet.  So long as Kerry continues to finish strong, he won't change a thing.  If Dean does manage to win a couple of states on Super Tuesday, then Kerry will be forced to respond.    As it is, my initial concerns about a Kerry-Bush matchup are starting to fade.  The more I see this guy, the less inspiring he seems.  The Dean results in Iowa and New Hampshire have shown that the war is not really a big issue amongst most sane Democratic voters, so this battle will primarily be waged on economic grounds.  WHile Bush has serious problems in my eyes, the American public has already established that they like big spending, up to a certain point.  I believe that Kerry goes well beyond the desires of most normal Americans in the scope of his proposed spending.  His constant call to end the Bush Tax Cuts won't make him popular with many, especially after we pass through tax season here and so many Americans realize they have overpaid.  In general, most of us are going to get a pretty good refund, and the smart will then adjust their withholding.    Anyway, it's Kerry and Dean from here, with Edwards comfortably filling the VP slot to bring the South into play.  I do mourn the passing of Clark, since he provided so much entertainment, but he isn't a viable candidate.  He is a version of Howard Dean, just a little more laid back but quite a bit more unhinged.  So if it comes down to Bush-Kerry, I'm comfortable in predicting another bad four years for sociopathic hyper-agressive muslims.

I'm conflicted, because I feel like I need to go into the whole WMD issue in depth, but I don't want to.  Mostly because in my mind it is perfectly clear that we did the right thing.  I still think WMD activities were going on, and much of it is in Syria or the Becca Valley (according to the Mossad).  They will turn up some day.  But even with the WMD absence, there were another thousand reasons why the Iraqi war was justified.  We did the right thing, and if I need to, I'll go into that.  Just let me know if you want to hear it.

      The Dennis Miller Show.  Did anyone other than Mark and I see this last night?  Thanks for calling and reminding me, Mark.  Overall, it wasn't too bad.  Like any first show, it was rocky at times and Miller seemed stiff, which he poked fun a couple of times.  Despite the lack of energy, I think it has some potential.  Ahnuld was the first guest, and I have to say he impressed me.  He sounded much more conservative than he did during his campaign, and he certainly seems to have a command of the issues.  I really expect him to be a Senator some day, since he can't hold any higher office in DC, and he seems to have the ambition for the national stage.  He could be an effective senator, and a good spokesperson for the GOP someday.  Provided he continues to be as conservative as he seemed last night.  The roundtable discussion was the best.  I always enjoy those parts of news shows.  Dennis had David Horowitz, an ex-radical from the 60s who converted to the True Path of conservatism.  Horowitz is an effective speaker and spends most of his time trying to speak at universities, inevitably clashing with the college left as they try to stifle his speeches.  Naomi Watts showed up in her standard feminist attire of a bright red dress.  I've heard of her, but never really heard her speak.  She spewed out the typical Leftist mantras, and you could practically label her statements before she uttered her third or fourth word (Standard 'for the chilrun' rant #2, Standard 'Bush Lied' rant #3 and so on).  Finally, there was David Frum, a former speech writer for GWB and the originator of the term Axis of Evil.  He was also touting a book on the Mideast written with Richard Pearle.  The only downside of the roundtable was Dennis.  He didn't jump in enough.  He seemed willing to let these three go at it.  That's fine to a point, but I watch to see Dennis skewer people and inject his own views (most of which I agree with).  He needs to interact more during this segment.  As it was, it just rehashed the same old arguments about BUSH LIED and we should spend money on the chilrun.  Frum and Horowitz fell into the old trap of trying to argue facts with Watts while she reverted to sound bites and tired old half truths.  She seemed smarmy and 'above it all' in her presentation, like she was trying to teach small children about how the world works.  Anyway, a good show and I'm going to watch it when I can.  CNBC at 9 PM, opposite Hannity and Colmes (which has never been a show I enjoyed).

But even if this is a site operated by kooks for kooks, I'm still troubled by what I've seen of the Face.  The high resolution photos still leave a lot of questions unanswered, but I'm not willing to take the Enterprise stance that NASA under orders from the NSA has doctored the images.    The Face is still a pretty strange structure, and those arguing that it is nothing but a mesa have not quite answered all of the lingering questions.    Anyway, the site provides some entertainment, especially when it contends that Spirit is sitting on a field strewn with metal artifacts.  Maybe it's seeing a failed Russian lander.

It was simply amazing to hear what was going on at the JPL control room as the lander executed its programming without a flaw.  The controller would watch the clock and say "Parachute should be deployed" and then before he could finish his sentence, the confirmation tone came from the spacecraft.  Each step, from the firing of the retros, to the ground radar, to the airbag inflation, is all went perfectly.  It really amazed me that as the thing was bouncing around, it still had communication with earth and was telling us each time it bounced.    It filled me with pride.  This is the fifth time we've landed a functioning raft on Mars.  The total number of succesful times anything has landed on Mars?  Five.  This page gives a complete list of all Mars missions through history.  We've had our own share of failures, but we are the only people to get the job done.  The Russians have 16 failed missions to thier name.  The Martian surface is littered with crashed Russian landers.  If we ever do find evidence of technology on Mars, we should take a moment to check for the Hammer and Sickle on the wreckage.  And not only are we able to do this, we decided to go ahead and land two of them in the same month!    Despite the problems with Spirit, our success blinds us to the magnitude of what we have done.  This is America at it's best, and all the more reason we need to embrace Big Things.  Who else can do it at this moment in time?

      I was watching Fox News this weekend, and on one of the financial shows, I saw an old man dispense wisdom in such clear language, I had to repeat it here.  I don't remember his name, but he was some Wall Street guru who commanded a great deal of respect.  The way he quietly explained the export of jobs struck me like a hammer.  I had been grappling with my belief that this is a good thing, searching for a way to put words to what I knew to be true, but he nailed it.  Companies who export certain jobs to India, like help desk or programming, do not do so out of long term profit.  There is a short term gain, but that is quickly competed away as more industries follow suit, driving up the prices in India and eating into the profits gained by export.  Downward pressures on service pricing will be realized through the natural competitive cycle of business.  Prices will match costs, and the reduced labor cost will be felt by the consumer.  What this does is reduce prices, making things cheaper,and freeing up cash for other things.  The consumer will get more for their money, and have more left over for other purposes.  This excess cash is what creates demand for new industries.  Just as business computers drove down prices, consumers eventually had enough money left over to buy 'luxury' items like computers or cable TV.  That drives a new demand that needs to be serviced, and new industries fill those gaps.  This is a healthy cycle.  Those who lose their jobs to India represent the slack labor pool that can be accessed by new companies.  The labor pool is replenished, holding down the cost of labor and allowing the new start ups to access this labor for lest cost, meaning more start ups can afford to give it a go.  If the labor market was not replenished, labor cost will continue to rise, making it near impossible for new ventures to get going due to the lack of talented, educated workers who are willing to work for smaller salaries in the hopes of hitting it big later.  This has happened before.  All of the programers and technical support workers started off making very little money since there was little demand.  The old timers, who got in early and worked for peanuts reaped substantial rewards for their labor.  As the industry matured, entry level jobs became quite lucrative, with plenty of promotions and raises available to anyone who was willing to work.  To say that those jobs will never be replaced is akin to saying that creativity is dead, and no new industries will ever be invented.  It is like saying that the world is static, and despite all the past examples, new products never gain acceptance.  We can't spend out lives doing what we did yesterday.  The loss of these jobs is a great thing for this economy.  It is the engine of capitalism, and we should see this as good tidings.  It keeps us healthy and allows innovation.    The man was brilliant.

      From the internal new service at Pfizer.  This is a Reuters article.  Fears Grow As Drug Firms Quit Antibiotic Research        By Ben Hirschler and Ransdell Pierson     LONDON/NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - With "superbugs" stalking hospitals and old killers such as tuberculosis re-emerging, the world badly needs more powerful antibiotics.     Yet the pipeline of new treatments is drying up as drug firms -- citing poor financial returns -- focus instead on chronic conditions, such as high cholesterol, where medicines are taken for years rather than curing patients in one or two weeks.      .....  "The regulatory requirements have risen to a level that has meant companies can no longer see the investment would be justified," said Trevor Jones, director general of the Association of the British Pharmaceuticals Industry, representing some of Europe's biggest drug makers.     The fate of Aventis SA's   new antibiotic Ketek has highlighted the problem for many pharmaceutical executives. To satisfy regulators, the Franco-German company had to conduct a huge -- and costly -- 24,000-patient study.     "That scared a lot of drug companies because it still has not been approved in the United States," said Tally. "The other thing that is scaring off big pharma is that if you do have a drug against resistant strains of bacteria, hospitals restrict use of it. They hold it in reserve, which cuts down on sales."

       urlLink CNN.com - 'Return of the King' dominates Golden Globes - Jan. 26, 2004   Looking more and more likely that Lord of the Rings will do well at the Oscars.  I saw numerous clips this weekend about how it is the favorite, and all of these people saying that if it doesn't get the Oscar, then Bad Things should happen to the Academy.  First, I don't really care too much about the Oscars.  They never really reward merit, except for a few instances which seem to be the exception.  So I don't give them much stock.  But the universal accolade that is given to ROTK (Return of the King) once again bothers me.  I won't go into the massive, fundamental flaws behind the Tolkein work, and how it really is quite poor storytelling.  I've had that argument.  And I'm sure Mike will jump in and fefend the first movie, but I can't agree with that either.  The more I think about the complete trilogy the more I am convinced it is just such a poor story, no one could really make a good film from it.  The entire trilogy was mostly antiseptic.  There was little sense of doom or urgency.  The CGI hordes no longer inspire anything but cliche.  Really, does the sight of 100,000 CGI Orcs create any more anxiety than 10,000?  When I know that the fundamental premise of Tolkein is simple - no main character will pay a price to achieve victory.  You could point to Boromir, since he died at the end of FOTR, but I don't think he suffered as much as the audience was forced to suffer during the death scene that needed an intermission.  I've been pounded with clips of ROTK this weekend on the cable outlets.  I keep seeing whatever her name is, the woman that followed them to battle totting an undersized SHerpa on her horse.  I see her wanting to join in the fun of battle, seemingly oblivious to the consequences.  And why not?  Everyone who returns from battle waltzes in as if they just put in a hard couple of hours tilling soil.  No blood, no pain, and very little grime.  When she finally kills the incompetent Witch King, she's in no worse shape than if she had performed a little gardening in her back yard.  Antiseptic.  I understand they want the rating for maximum audience, and gore is not the ultimate indicator of the quality of a film, but when the film strives to make us understand that this is a War to end all War, and these people are willing to die in order to win, then we need to see how difficult it is to fight Sauron.    As it is, Sauron inspires no fear, hatred or even interest.  He is increasingly incompetent throughout the entire story.  In a final moment of idiocy, he actually SEES the sherpa with the Ring on the slopes of Mount Doom, but turns away so he can crush a pathetically small army of humans by pouring out an overwhleming number of bad guys.  If you have such numbers, and the human army is dependent upon you opening the massive gate before they can touch you, couldn't their final disposition wait a few moments while you take care of a short version of Luke Skywalker toting the equivalent of a proton torpedo in the immediate neighborhood of your exhaust shaft?  Can we talk about priorities?  I'm really indifferent about the films.  What sets me over the edge is the slavish devotion of so many people to such an inferior story.  There wasn't a single moment that really held any emotion or meaning to me, and I sat through nearly ten hours of film throughout the complete series.    Why don't we reward good storytelling over CGI?  An Epic is not an Epic because it is long.  An Epic is long because it requires depth to tell the story.  We learned nothing about these characters that wasn't already known in the first two hours.  No change, no evolution, nothing.    And never mind the misguided and ridiculous themes of the evil of technology and the purity of agrarian life.  Bah!

Can you believe President Bush is still pushing the cockamamie claim that we went to war in Iraq with a real coalition rather than a gaggle of poodles and lackeys?  I wonder how many of these soldiers she's had the privilege of looking in the eye? I've met and worked with soldiers from the UK, Australia, New Zealand (Hey, Maureen, how come you don't bother mentioning these in your list? Can it be you're stacking the deck?), Poland, the Ukraine, Romania, Azerbaijan, and Denmark.   I've also met Fijians. Those guys ride around in swivel chairs with machine gun mounts on the backs of pickup trucks guarding Iraqi Currency Exchange convoys. Their role is absolutely vital, their job dangerous as hell, and they are as tough as two-dollar steaks.  Further, Maureen, believe me--the ANZACS are not poodles, nor lackeys. Nor do they represent a government who is.  Tony Blair is nobody's lackey.  Read the whole, disjointed, incoherent, flunk-out-of-comp-class mess.

       urlLink Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Press Releases   It looks like cautious, but good news, on the rover.  The systems appear to be healthy, and the rover is sending troubleshooting tones back to earth, so it seems to be physically in good shape.  They are focusing on memory corruption, which would be understandable considering the craft spent eight months in space being exposed to radiation.  It's designed for that, but memory is easily corruptable.  So it might just be a matter of uploading the software and rebooting the system.  That will take some time, but as long as they have power is should be doable.  These things are designed to be robust, so the recovery process is not as touchy as it might sound if you're used to your own Windows .dll problems.    I'm feeling better about it!  Don't forget the second rover lands late Saturday night.

      I actually watched the Presidential Debate last night.  I planned on working on my book, but I flipped it on for a few minutes and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  First off, I hope Dennis Kucinich never goes away.  Let me summarize his platform.  15% immediate decrease in the DoD budget.  Universal Pre-K for all children, free.  Universal free college to every American.  Universal not-for-profit health care for everyone.  Make all colleges non-profit.  Do not allow privitization of Iraqi industry.  Pay reparations to Iraq and pull out in 90 days.  And balance the budget in four years.    The frightening thing was the amount of applause.  I know he isn't a viable candidate, but people were chearing these ideas.  Joe Leiberman proposed a new program called MediKids, which will cover every American child from birth to age 25, even if they are already on a parent's health care.  Dean, between screaming, touted Universal Health Care.   Both Dean and Leiberman can't understand how drugs can be sold in Canada for cheaper than they are sold here, and want to allow import.  Leiberman took care to say he wasn't attacked the products the Drug companies produced, he was attacking thier greed.    To a man, they prattled on about the illegal, immoral unjust Iraqi war.  Wesley Clark had some real wild things to say about how he was a Democrat of Conviction.  He said that while in the military, he focused on taking care of people, and that's what the Democratic Party does - takes care of people.  (Never mind the idea that people should take care of themselves).  Are we electing a President or a Mother?  It was a real freak show.

       urlLink Bush to propose spending freeze - The Washington Times: Nation/Politics   Finally we see something approaching restraint from the drunken sailor, GWB.  I've spouted off on my anger at spending, so that's nothing new.  Now Bush is trying to react to the decay his numbers are seeing amongst conservatives.  I'm sure most conservatives will end up sticking with him due to the terror issue, but this is really too late to do any good.  He just said in the SOTU that he was looking at a 4% increase across the board.  To suddenly switch like this is a Karl Rove inspired move.  Good politics I guess, but it sends a muddled message to those that are paying attention.  Look for a 1% growth to be portrayed as a cut.  The Dems will trot our starving children, homeless, unemployed and so on, trying to illustrate the cruelty of only spending $2.4 trillion dollars in the coming year.  How can we get by on only $6 billion a day in this nation!    Think about that number.  There are 275 million Americans.  Your annual share of the federal budget is $8700 per year.  Of course, only half of us actually pay any federal taxes, to the true burden on those that pay is more likely in the $15,000 range.  And that doesn't include state and local income tax, property tax, gas tax, sales tax, tolls, registration fees, and so on.    Here's an intresting site showing 1997 numbers for state and local taxes.  Take Ohio for an example since most of you are in this area.  Ohio collects $1467 per year per person in various taxes.  That means a family of four pays $6400 in these taxes.  http://www.ncsl.org/programs/fiscal/sltxlvls/STpCap97.htm  Ohio collected another $692 per person in property taxes, so our family of four paid nearly $2800.    So on average, $9200 to the state and $8700 to the feds.  $1500 a month consumed in taxes.  And we haven't talked about Social Security and Medicaire deductions yet.  Remember this when it is time to talk about other people's 'need' for your money.  Remember it when they parade the children out on stage who can't even add, or don't know that we are a Republic.

      What I JUST read:  Adventure Capitalist: The Ultimate Road Trip by Jim Rogers.  A friend at work recommended this because of my penchant for travel books.  Great read, this crazy guy, after previously circling the globe on a motorcycle, builds a custom Mercedes and drive 115,000 odd miles over the globe with his wife (yikes! I have trouble driving with my wife to Toledo).  He does this to gauge various global markets from the ground and find investment oppurtunities and to check up on his investments from previous trips.  Along the way he spouts his rhetoric about investing, about the various economic conditions of parts of the world, and in the end sums up the "future" of the American economy in relation to the world.  Great mix of travel and economic insight.    Jim Rogers co-created the Quantum Fund with Gearge Soros back in the day, the fund increased by 4000% while the S&P increased around 50%, so the guy knows a bit about this stuff.  Anyway, interesting read, if only to learn how one goes about driving through central Africa.

       urlLink Bloomberg Printer-Friendly Page   Here is an example of the new economy and the typical approaches to change exhibited by both parties.  Kodak is slashing 15,000 jobs due to a shift from film to digital media for photography.  Recently, they announced that they will no longer sell film cameras.    Kodak is essentially trying to retool and survive the new wave of technology.  Good for them.  But now we have 15,000 people who also need to retool and survive.  What's the answer?  I'm sure unemployment and government benefits will be the first thing touted to help these people.  The Democrats will decry the job loss as a consequence of the Tax Cuts and Halliburton.  Progress is evil and people are harmed.  So should we subsidize film?  A Film Camera Tax Credit?    Everyone needs to be prepared to change lives at a moments notice.  There is no such thing as security.  You have to accept that and prepare yourselves as best you can.  BUt most of us aren't willing to accept the consequences of freedom, preferring to look to others to provide security through laws and spending.  Bah, I guess I'm just in a bad mood today.  Tired of the whining and the crying about 'fully funding education' and such drivel from the Left.  Tired of the war bashing, space bashing, anti-progress wing wanting to turn to unions and taxes and subsidies and pouring yet more money into the black hole of social experiments.

       urlLink WorldNetDaily: Democrats' response   And to be fair, you should read this.  I actually watched it, and it was such a freak show.  There wasn't a single actual plan presented, and from what I've heard, the Democrats worship Plans.  Without a Plan, you are nothing.  Pelosi was like a robot.  My favorite conclusion from her portion of the speech was the concept that we will defeat the terrorists through inspections.  We will crush them beneath the wheels of organization and communications.    Quote -  Democrats have a better way to ensure our homeland security.   One-hundred percent of containers coming into our ports or airports must be inspected. Today, only 3 percent are inspected. One-hundred percent of chemical and nuclear plants in the United States must have high levels of security. Today, the Bush administration has tolerated a much lower standard.   One-hundred percent communication in real time is needed for our police officers, firefighters and all our first responders to prevent or respond to a terrorist attack. Today, the technology is there, but the resources are not. One-hundred percent of the enriched uranium and other material for weapons of mass destruction must be secured. Today, the Administration has refused to commit the resources necessary to prevent it from falling into the hands of terrorists.   America will be far safer if we reduce the chances of a terrorist attack in one of our cities than if we diminish the civil liberties of our own people.   End Quote.  Daschle isn't much better.  Under his reasoning, tax cuts cause people to flee the nation.  Quote -   The massive tax cuts that were supposed to spark an economic expansion have instead led to an economic exodus.   End Quote  And the juciest line of them all -  Quote  -  America can't afford to keep rewarding the accumulation of wealth over the dignity of work.   End Quote.  Excuse me Sen. Daschle, but what do you think WORK is?  Do you understand that wealth is what DRIVES this economy?  This phrase betrays the fundamental moral fissure that is the Leftist mentality.  Wealth is bad, work is good.  Therefore the only path to sainthood is to labor without accumulating wealth.  That's called 'peasentry', and I don't recommend it as a national policy.  Really, I'm beyond a coherent argument here.  It is as fundamental as the sky is blue.  Daschle isn't stupid, he knows this.  But to sit there and utter it to the people like it is a sacred truth is just amazing.  Read on, there's plenty more.

       urlLink WorldNetDaily: Read Bush's address   The State of the Union address.  I ended up half watching it with mixed feelings.  There isn't any doubt as to how I will vote in November.  The primary concern is terror, and that trumps all else.  Bush will get my vote for that.  But, if 9/11 had never happened, and Bush had ran the domestic side as he is now, I would be howling mad and would likely not vote at all.  I am seriously angry at him for so many things, such as the education bill, the drug bill, the amnesty, and the continued expansion of programs and spending.  It is maddening to think that a republican is signing on to these programs, but his father was no better.  I understand the political realities in this country.  Bush's polls track low when it comes to domestic issues.  The nation as a whole prefers Democrats when it comes to social concerns.  I think that is a failure to educate voters rather than a true desire for socialism, but more on that later.  People want handouts.  THey want us to take money from one group and give it to them.  The reality is, you can't be elected if you don't steal from others.  So Bush is doing what any other good politician would do - he is going to start with the handouts in exchange for votes.  At this point in our history, I have to hold my nose and accept it as the price for keeping a vigorous war on terror going.  There's no purity in politics.  It's why I spent the first five years of my political awareness angry and bitter, wanting the Gingrich revolution to gut the government down to nothing.  The political trades that were made were a bitter lesson, but that's the way of things.  People want handouts.  Dealing with the Federal Government is like being assaulted.  You get bruised and battered, and you count yourself fortunate if all you have are a few broken ribs rather than a bashed in skull.  Watching the SOTU speech is like experiencing another assault.  You're just waiting on it to end, and hoping that there isn't too much damage done.  The Democrats have us beat on social issues because of the way the argument has been framed.  Who can deny funding education, helping the elderly, cushioning the blow of unemployment, helping train workers, assuring a retirement and so on.  On the surface those things sound so innocent.  Stand in the way, and perforce you are wanting to let people suffer, starve children and smother grandpa with a pillow.  The text of the argument never goes to the deeper issue of self-sufficiency, the moral obligation to keep the money you make, and the long term effects of a dependency based society.  We can never talk about creating more opportunity, or allowing people to have more control of their lives.  Just 'kill grandpa' and 'starve chilrun'.    People aren't willing to engage the deeper philosophical differences between the party.  So the Democrats win because they have the 'shallow' high ground.  Thus we have to create handouts for votes.  So while the SOTU had some great points on the War on Terror, overall, I'm just happy to walk away under my own power.

      Beware of Web Sites.  A personal experience last night.  I was searching for song lyrics and did a Google search.  I clicked on the first site that popped up, then left my computer for about 30 seconds to get a can of pop.  When I came back, terrible things had happened.  The site had installed many things on my computer without my permission.  1)  It changed my home page without asking. That's happened before, so blah.  No big deal.  2) It installed two toolbars in my Internet Explorer, and hijacked my search engine preference.  The toolbars would not go away.  It also began generating six pop up ads for every page I browsed, even reputable pages like Fox News and CNN.    3) It installed a taskbar attached to my Windows Taskbar that would not go away.  It was some integrated search feature.  4) It installed icons on my desktop for Porn Dialers.  5) It filled my favorites folder with links to Porn sites.  I started hunting these things down, and most of them would not uninstall.  Some had to be remove with registry edits.  I ran Ad-Aware, which searches for Spyware.  Spyware, if you aren't familiar, are programs that run in your computer that monitor where you surf and send that data to marketing companies, who then push pop up ads to your desktop relating to what sites you like to visit.  I had last done a scan a few days before this event.  Ad-Aware found over 300 pieces of spyware!  It took several passes to remove it all.  My computer is still not acting correctly.  I still get pop up ads and occasionally IE will change the page I'm viewing with no prompting.  Bam, it switches right in the middle of my reading.  Aside for descending into a Howard Dean rage, I can't do much about it.  So this weekend (or sooner) I'll have to completely rebuild the hard drive.  Not the end of the world, since my data is not stored on my OS drive.  But still a pain.  In retrospect, I recall lowering my security settings on IE recently while trying to get a Java program to execute.  I'm sure that allowed this to occur.  I wonder about people who do this.  Do they really think this is effective marketing?  I know they just try to generate traffic to sites in order to sell banner space, and being able to show high traffick numbers helps those sales.  However, the companies buying that ad space should understand what is happening.  The pop ups were mostly for legitimate products, sold by known companies.  And just when I railed about the freedom to advertise!  But at least I can take comfort in knowing that hijacking a computer is a little different from sponsoring the Super Bowl.  Be careful with your surfing.  I can't imagine what this would do to someone with little to no computer savvy.

       urlLink FOXNews.com - Top Stories - Hubble Mission to End, NASA Says   The end of Hubble.  I'm surprised at how quickly NASA is moving in reorganizing and changing mission priorities after the Bush declaration.  I really thought it would take many months before we saw any hard news come out.  While I'm sad to see Hubble go, I think this is the right decision.  Changing our focus and getting us to become a more routine space-faring people will enhance future Hubble-like missions.  The possibilities of what can be done will increase dramatically, and building a massive observatory on the dar side of the moon will be within reach in 20-30 years.  If getting that requires the sacrifice of Hubble, then so be it.  Actually, this isn't so much a sacrifice as it is a return to the original mission timeline.  Hubble has exceeded it's life design, and we've certainly got our money back on the amount of science it has generated.  It would have been nice to bring it back down and install it in the Smithsonian, but that wasn't possible even before the Columbia accident.  I'm still waiting to hear how the rest of the observatory projects are going to fare.  Probably not well, considering they have no direct impact on the human missions.  There were some exciting things coming up, and I hope that one day they get their launch.    The interferometer missions were the most promising.  Using many smaller space telescopes, flying in formation, scientists would be able to use interferemetry to add the light signals together to create a virtual telescope the size of the separation distance between the smaller scopes.  The principle is used in Radio Telescopes on Earth.  Scopes on opposite sides of Earth can link together and make a telescope the size of the entire planet.    With a long based interferometric scope, it would have been possible to actually take photographs of planets orbiting other stars.  The Planet Imager was just such a project, along with the Terrestrial Planet Finder mission.  Both of these scopes would have allowed for spectrophotometric analysis of planetary atmospheres from light years away.  These missions are as close as we are going to get to actually going there.  Hopefully, as we gain the technological know-how and increasing access to space, those missions will be launched.

The fifth book is only out in hardcover, which is well beyond what I'm willing to pay, so now it is time to switch to a new series.  This is another one I found on the Baen Free Library, and I've mentioned it before.  It takes place during the reign of Justinian (530ish AD).  It seems that what Man has become in the far future has sent back one of thier own to try to change history for some reason still not known.  They set themselves up in India, and use that as a base to destroy the Holy Roman Empire.  An opposition force has sent back what is essentiall a super computer inside a crystal (small enough to be worn on a necklace) to try to oppose the Indians.  This finds its way to Belasarius, one of the greatest generals in world history.  From there we are into standard Really Big Wars and Technology Out of Place in Time (TM).  Entertaining, but in a guily way.  Just like the Ringo books, it reminds of some of the mindless stuff I read as a teenager.  Great escapist stuff.

      This is going to be a busy week.  Iowa tonight, finally!  I couldn't pop over to Fox News without a deluge of Iowa 'news', even though nothing is really happening.  I'll be glad to get this one behind us.  Hopefully, Howard "SMASH!" Dean will pull it out and cement the liklihood of being nominated.  I'd rather see him campaign all year instead of Kerry or Gephardt (the miserable failure).    I don't completely understand the power of Iowa.  Only 10-12% of registered Democrats showup for Caucus, yet the media acts as if Iowa annoints the winner.  I know history says you can't finish worse than third and still win the nomination, but if you are less than third tier anyway, you probably aren't going to win a dog catching post.  Let's be done with it.  Tomorrow night we have the State of the Union (SOU).  I know that the cynical look at the SOU as just another political speech, but it really is more meaningful than that.  It does set the tone for the coming year in terms of legislation, projects and the political battles that will consume the time until the election.  Sure, we all get tired of the incessent hand clapping, but it's worth taking a look at it.  Most of the time I'll just read the speech transcript, so I'll be sure to post that here after the fact.  The rover is moving around.  It rolled up to a rock and has taken some pictures.  We're supposed to get the first spectrometer data back today during a press conference.  I'm sure there's nothing startling yet, otherwise it would have leaked.  But it will still be interesting.    That's about it from the top of my head.  I'm sure there will be more posts later today.

       urlLink OpinionJournal - Featured Article   This could be a remarkable tax plan if it turns out to be true.  Bush seeks to introduce a tax free savings account, and unlike IRAs, you can pull money out anytime you want without paying taxes.  Under the plan, you can save $7500 per year and shelter it from taxes.  Your own little tax shelter!    He also includes an IRA type account for retirement.  Currently, the limit is $3000 per year, and he seeks to increase it to $7500 per year.    Look for the left to savage them as more 'rich tax cuts', since only the 'rich' can afford to save money.  But my bet is everyone will take a positive interest.  For the most part, people WANT to establish savings, but it is difficult to do.  Now that a tax benefit might be attached, suddenly it becomes easier.  With a typical marginal rate of 20%, the government is reducing your tax burden by $1500 if you managed to save $7500.  That's a nice rate of return, without a point of interest being paid.

       Gay marriage   Honestly, I don't care if someone is gay. I only dislike what seems to be the prevalent culture of homosexuals. This does cause me to be prejudiced against homosexuals because I assume they will have the opinions of their majority. Or at least their most vocal representatives.   Now, on marriage, that seems to me to be between man and a woman. I see no reason for the government to favor one citizen or couple of citizens over any other. The government is in the business of promoting social behavior, unfortunately. It seems that is accepted now and expected. I refer you to welfare, Earned Income Tax Credit, Food stamps as being means to favor bastard children and poverty. Marriage is already favored and encouraged by the deductions and various other benefits acquired by married couples. Should "civil unions" be included in that group? I say yes.  The true question is of course money. I don't give a rat's ass about the "sanctity of marriage." That's a load of crap. It is merely someone's desire to impress upon others their own worldview. Mainly by religious adherents. Two men or two women forming a household is none of my business. I can exclude them from my own private groups, property, and such but the government has no reason to do so. It violates equal treatment under the law.  The problem with allowing such unions to me is the loophole it creates. I honestly would form such a union with a total stranger just so I could save money. Why shouldn't I? It would be like seniors getting divorced so they can get more social security money. Nothing changed between them, but their status in the eyes of government. So now we must ask why the gays want to have marriages just like the heteros have it.  I know that gays are seeking this "right" to marry and be recognized as the same as straight people because they are at heart rebels and this is their latest cause. I feel uncomfortable being on their side, but I feel it is morally right to allow them to claim the same benefits as a married couple. Please chime in with your own views using the comment function.

I saw a poll somewhere that had some interesting data.  58% of Democrats supports a "US effort to return to the moon and go to Mars."

      I feel the need to spout off again about the Pharma Industry and the relentless assault of the 'needy' class upon the profits of the productive class.  There is an article today in the Pfizer news service from the AP, but I won't copy the whole thing here since it is somewhat long.  Suffice it to say - lawmakers want to force disclosure of all marketing costs expended by drug makers.  Sounds innocent, but it is the first step to stirring up hatred among the ignorant.  The Pharma industry spends $5 billion a year on marketing.  That includes commercials, print ads, swag for doctors and so on.  There is nothing unethical about this.  Lipitor, as an example, has two competing drugs out there, and while the efficacy is debateable with each drug, it isn't clear enough to be a no brainer decision.  Drug makers try to persuade docs of the virtues of their drug.  The more drugs we sell, the more money we make and our employees and shareholders are paid.  That's how it works.  Here's a quote -   Said Lauren Moughon, an Olympia lobbyist for AARP: ``The pharmaceutical industry fears nothing more than a light being shone on their greed.''  End quote.  Greed.  It always comes back to greed.  Drug makers invent drugs because of profit.  These drugs have fantastic benfits to people like Lauren Moughon, yet we are castigated for providing this product and extracting a profit from our labors.  Our production of this drug is not mandated by law.  We don't have to do it.  We didn't have to invent the compound.  The company undertakes a massive risk in developing the drug, and the thanks received takes the form of pillory.  We are greedy for providing a product people want and a cost that covers our expenses and compensates our shareholders.    Another quote -   [President of the Washington State Medical Association] said voluntary guidelines have eliminated some of the worst excesses, but drug companies still spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on marketing to Washington doctors.     ``Why would they be concerned about disclosing it?'' he said. ``There's value in the public knowing how this money is being spent.''  End quote.  What business is it of the public?  Why is it important?  Financial expenditures are disclosed under SEC rules for publically traded companies.  These rules do not require a detailed breakdown of marketing costs.  The drug companies answer to shareholders, not to the general public.  For someone to have the audacity to speculate that financial information is subject to public scrutiny is amazing.  Does the public have a right to the financial data of an individual?  But this isn't an individual, this is a company that can affect the health of millions you say.  Fine, but the fact that we provide a product that is freely purchased by patients does not expand our relationship with the public beyond any other industry, such as the car makers.  We provide a product.  Buy it, or don't.  It is a simple choice.  Ah, but then we come to 'need'.  People 'need' Lipitor and Detroll and Celebrex.  People 'need' to have cures for ailments.  Does that 'need' magically create these drugs?  Does a patient in pain cause morphine to appear?  Someone has to service that need, and the price of that service is called cost.  'Need' and cost are not dependent upon one another, unless you are willing to pay anything to fullfill that need, which has been demonstrated as no longer true.  People seem to think that their health 'needs' completely alleviate any price that might be attached to that 'need'.  Your need does not compell another person to work or produce.  The money you are willing to pay motivates that other person.  To pretend that your need creates a discount on another's labor is tantamount to slavery.  "I need what you make, so you must make it and accept less compensation than you would receive otherwise.  Get to work."  How long would you work under those circumstances?  What would happen if the producers laughed at the 'needy' and simply put down their tools and went home?  See Atlas Shrugged.  People love to rail against the cost of marketing as being a major factor on the cost of medicine.  According to iMedia.com, the auto industry spent $50 billion in 2000 on marketing.  Ten times what the drug industry spent.  How much does that add to the price of a car?  Will a car save your life?  Will a car reduce your pain?  Will it give you back the ability to pick up your grandkids without pain?  Yet we think nothing of spending $25-40k on a car, spread out in $300-500 payments for years on end.  But a $100 prescription to alleviate a disease is intolerable?

       urlLink America's New Space Plan: A Vision in Search of Focus, Observers Say   The big Bush Plan will be revealed today, so there are quite a few articles out there about it.  Despite trying to tone down my optimism, I'm getting carried away with a sense of hope that this could actually happen.  I recall the excitement when Bush (41) announced a similar venture, only to see it die when the estimates came back at $400 billion.  One of the articles I've look at this morning suddenly demonstrated the wisdom of Bush's 5% per year increase at NASA.  This money is not intended to actually get us to the moon.  The money, along with a focused direction, is intended to get us to grapple with the problems of putting a permenent presence on the moon, and later Mars.  It makes no sense to cobble together a massive program using today's technology, with a lot of assumptions, and then pull out a $400 billion pricetag when no one really knows which approach holds the most promise.  The Bush budget proposal is a way to throw seed money out there.  As we begin to do some serious research on the problems, and begin testing the new technology, we will gain a better understanding of what it would take to accomplish the mission.  At some point in the next 5 years, a realistic budget can be drawn up, and we will have some sense of what it will take.  This avoids the trap of pricing the mission beyond the ability to even try.  The Bush 41 proposal was kind of like getting some guys together and saying "We want to be Delta Airlines" when the airplane hadn't even been invented.  Imagine inventing the technology and then going instantly to the scale of Delta.  The cost would be staggering and the technical issues daunting.  The new proposal will take us along in measured steps as we begin to build the things that have never moved beyond paper design.  Now we can see what can be done.  The budget proposal is modest, and it seems certain to happen despite the Luddites who would rather we fix school roofs and pour money into programs that have already proven their failure.  The next decade promises to be an exciting time to live, and I'm looking forward to every morsel of news.  Maybe it's time to re-evaluate the career again.

       urlLink Salon.com | Joe Conason's Journal   This is from the 'Are you a freaking idiot?' Department.  Let me just pop in a quote from Mr. Conason.  When President Bush inspires us onward and upward to Mars this week, his political calculations may be more earthly. Expanding space exploration is a wonderful aspiration for America and humanity -- and also quite promising for the Houston economy, the national aerospace industry, and one company in particular that has long pondered exploration of the red planet: Halliburton.   Yes, the firm once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney -- fabled beneficiary of no-bid multibillion-dollar military contracts and high-priced provider of Kuwaiti oil -- is determined to drill on Mars and the moon. Surely this scheme has nothing to do with the Bush space initiative. But somehow, no matter what worthy motivations lie behind the president's policies, he and Cheney always appear to be shilling for their corporate clientele.   .....  Could someone explain to old Joe that fossil fuels require.....um.....fossils.

      I can't link directly to this story because it comes from the Pfizer Intenal news server.  So I have to paste it all here.  The crux of the story is that New York wants to institute a tax on businesses that don't offer health insurance.  The tax is to the tune of $3,000 per employee.  So if I am a small business with 50 workers, mostly small assembly jobs, and I manage to profit $4,000 per employee per year ($200,000 profit), the state will yank $150,000 from my pocket.  75% tax increase!!  Yes, that will persuade me to keep my business in New York (sarcasm).  Read on for the gory details.  Begin story     01/13/2004 08:18:39  NYTimes:Proposal Would Tax Businesses That Do Not Insure Workers    By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA The New York Times, January 13, 2004  Two powerful interest groups, health workers and hospitals, are proposing an audacious and costly effort by New York State to cover one million people without health insurance and modernize hospitals. The proposal would be financed by a tax on businesses that do not insure their workers and by a billion-dollar state bond act.  The plan by 1199/S.E.I.U., the health care workers' union, and the Greater New York Hospital Association comes at a time when the powers in Albany are vowing to rein in health care costs and not to raise taxes. The proposal, which would require changes in state law approved by the Legislature and the governor, is certain to draw criticism from conservatives in government and influential business lobbying groups.  But the union and the hospitals are a formidable political force in New York, with a history of spending millions of dollars on advertising, lobbying, phone  banks and campaign contributions to bend lawmakers to their will. In the past, they have won approval from Gov. George E. Pataki and legislators in both parties for major expansions of state health care programs and state spending.  The core of the plan is what in Albany has been called play-or-pay, a $3,000 tax on employers for each worker they do not insure, with a smaller levy for small businesses that pay low wages. No state imposes such a tax of any significant size, health care advocates say. Some of the money would be used to increase the number of people in New York's state-subsidized health plans like Medicaid, Family Health Plus and Healthy New York, which together already constitute the most expansive such system in the country.  Hospital and union officials, who control a multimillion-dollar lobbying fund, said they would use it to begin an advertising campaign in the next few weeks to promote their plan, a tactic they have used to great effect in the past. ''We will do whatever it takes to educate New Yorkers of the benefits of this initiative,'' said Dennis Rivera, president of 1199/S.E.I.U.  The plan calls for the sale of $1 billion to $2 billion in state bonds, possibly through a November ballot question, to provide low-cost loans to New York's financially troubled hospitals. The proposal puts some broadly worded restrictions on that money, saying that it would be used, for example, to make hospitals safer and more efficient.  It calls for the state to relieve New York City and the counties of their contribution to the Family Health Plus program, a fast-growing burden that local governments complain is forcing them to raise taxes. It also gives subsidies and tax breaks to businesses that already insure their employees. The aid to counties and businesses is meant, in part, to win allies in what will surely be an uphill legislative battle.  ''It is the boldest initiative we've ever undertaken,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the hospital association.  The plan's authors say that aides to Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders were briefed on it last week, and the authors intend to go public with it this week.  Reaction from the Capitol yesterday was cautious. John McArdle, chief spokesman for the Senate's Republican majority, noted that the majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, had worked with Mr. Rivera and Mr. Raske in the past, and that they had pledged to help the Senate curb the cost of Medicaid, the government health plan for the poor. One obvious area of agreement, he said, is a state takeover of the counties' share of Family Health Plus, which covers low-income adults who do not qualify for Medicaid.  ''At this point, I would just say we're looking at their plan, and we share the same goals here and we get there in different ways,'' Mr. McArdle said.  The governor's office did not return calls seeking comment.  Charles Carrier, chief spokesman for the Assembly's Democratic majority, would say only, ''The Assembly is reviewing it.''  The National Federation of Independent Business, the main lobbying group for small businesses, vehemently opposed the plan. ''A lot of these companies don't even show a $3,000-per-employee profit, so if you hit them with a $3,000-per-employee tax, you put them under, you bankrupt people,'' said Mark P. Alesse, director of the New York arm of the group.  He disputed a contention by Mr. Rivera and Mr. Raske that the tax would persuade many employers to begin providing insurance.  But Clifford R. Donaldson, Essex County manager and president-elect of the New York State Association of Counties, embraced the proposal. ''We believe that every New Yorker, regardless of ability to pay, deserves access to health care, and we also welcome anything that recognizes that counties can no longer afford to pay such a big share of that effort,'' he said.  The $3,000-per-employee assessment would be reduced, on a sliding scale, for businesses that have 25 employees or fewer and pay workers less than about $27,000 a year. Under the plan, the state would also pay 20 percent of the cost for a small business to buy worker coverage.  The people Mr. Raske and Mr. Rivera hope to cover are mostly the working poor. More than 3 million of New York's 19 million people have no health insurance. Of those, about 2 million have jobs or are supported by people who work. Most of those families have low incomes, but not so low that they would qualify for Medicaid or other government programs.  ''We're talking about getting at more than half of them, more than one million,'' Mr. Raske said.  The state adds taxes to hospital bills to help pay for care for the uninsured so that, in effect, employers who cover their workers help carry the weight of those who do not. Lowering the number of uninsured would allow the state to significantly reduce those charges.  In recent weeks, the talk of health care in the Capitol has been about restraining the rising cost of Medicaid, which has become the biggest piece of New York State's budget. Last month, the Senate Republicans unveiled a detailed plan to curb Medicaid expenses. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, is expected to propose his own Medicaid trims when he unveils his 2004-5 budget this month.  The goals of curbing Medicaid costs and a major new program to cover the uninsured are not necessarily contradictory, but they point in opposite directions, philosophically and fiscally.  From anyone else, a plan like that put forward by 1199 and the hospitals could be dismissed as pie in the sky, especially in a weak economy. But officials in Albany say their track record requires a serious look at the proposal.  In 1999, the two groups proposed raising the state cigarette tax to pay for creation or expansion of several programs for the uninsured. The plan was at first viewed as a long shot, but the union and the hospitals spent $10 million on ads promoting it, they threatened to spend more to attack politicians who stood in their way, and they got what they wanted.  Two years ago, the state faced a budget deficit, and health care cuts were expected. Instead, 1199 and the hospital association persuaded lawmakers to approve the conversion of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield to a profit-making company, and to devote much of the resulting windfall to hospitals, to pay for workers' raises.  In return, 1199, a historically Democratic union, supported the re-election of Mr. Pataki and many Republican legislators.   :TICKER: CADNR    Copyright (c) 2004 NewsEdge Corp 2001 Received by NewsEdge Insight: 01/13/2004 08:18:39

       urlLink OpinionJournal - John Fund on the Trail   Paul O'Neill is making a lot of noise with his book, and I guess it is worthy for comment.  First, I'm amazed by the hack job he is doing on his former boss.  It is rather unseemly for anyone in a cabinet level post to do this kind of thing.  The Executive Branch isn't like a job you and I would have, where we might vent our spleen over a boss that rubbed us the wrong way.  At this level, loyalty and discretion is expected, even if you have princicpled disagreements with your boss.  I'm sure Colin Powell has enough material to fill several books, but I expect he will be classy enough to take his disagreements home with him and lock them away, where they may surface a decade or so down the road, when it is more acceptable to mark out your position for historical record - not to score points against your boss.  O'Neill has broken many unwritten rules here, but beyond that, many of his claims are sounding laughable.  He blows the whistle on Bush's plan to invade Iraq, hatched well before 9/11.  Hey Paul, you ever think that it is PRUDENT to have such plans laying around, long before a need arises?  Would he be surprised to learn that we have plans sitting in the Pentagon to invade Canada?  England?  Mexico?  This is why we have a military, and part of their job is to plan for ALL things before we even consider them possible.  But even beyond common sense planning, regime change has been the stated policy of this nation since the first Bush, and even Clinton had plans laying around.  O'Neill has a decided opinion on the utility of tax cuts, which is fine.  He is entitled to his position.  However, the proper thing to do in such a situation is resign quietly and go home if you are that principled over the situation.  O'Neill hung around and focused his attention on non-Treasury issues, such as the environment and AIDS.    O'Neill's charges really don't require an in-depth defense.  I don't believe they will cause any harm, since most of the claims are easily demonstrated as nothing more than sour grapes over his firing.  Plus, he has a book to hawk, so the more damaging the claims, the more money he will make.    It is simply amazing to witness a complete attack on a sitting president by a former employer.  It is simply ungentlemenly.

       urlLink Ain't It Cool News - View Article   I apologize, but one more posting on the Passion.  Moriarity hated it as well, but again it seems for the wrong reasons.  It's like they expect to see a movie about all the good things that Jesus said, and less of the Passion.  Did they read the title of the Film when they went in??  Also, now that I think about it, this film is provoking thoughts that have been buried for a long time.  Christians and Jews have mostly stopped thinking about the opposed ideas built into their faiths.  Most Christians consider Jews as part of the family, while Jews, for the most part, are quite comfortable living and working with Christians.  The term Judeo-Christian has pretty much encapsulated the basis of our culture when it comes to matters of faith.  But the core Truth in Christianity and Judaism are in opposition, and this film is bringing this opposition to our awareness again.  To be perfectly frank, the Jews are monotheistic, and the idea of the Son of God and the divinity of Jesus is completely against their belief system.  It is heresy.  For the Christian perspective, anyone who denies Christ is not in a state of Grace with God, which means the Jews are heretical with respect to the core of Christianity.  Have both faiths conveniently ignored this long enough so it no longer matters?  Is the film forcing this idea to the forefront again?  Is that why it is so devisive?  Religions, as a meme, are driven to achieve domination over all other memes.  That's why a faith exists - to convert others to their way of thinking.  Have we tried to forget this over the past hundred years, pretending that we can all co-exist?

       urlLink FOXNews.com - Foxlife - Fox411 - Exclusive: Debbie Rowe Wants Respect, Not Custody   Roger Freidmen does a show on Fox News on Sunday where he, along with a panel, 'report' on the media performance during the week.  He's one of those snooty New York types who looks down on middle America.  Scroll down to the second piece to see the specific Passion comments.  Here's his review of the Passion, and it is full of anger and hatred for the movie.    "I saw "The Passion" at midnight last night in Los Angeles, since neither Newmarket nor Gibson's people would accommodate me with a press screening. Never mind, though, it was far more interesting to plunk down $11 at the Hollywood ArcLight and see "The Passion" with a big group. "  Mr. Big Shot had to see it with the massess since Gibson is ignoring the Media Gods, who would shred him even if he offered them his hand in friendship.  Good job, Mel.  ALWAYS make the media pay.  Have you noticed that any media clips of the movie are grainy?  Gibson isn't even providing clips to the media.  They have to go film scenes themselves, up on the screen.  I wonder if this is piracy?  "But the real problem with "The Passion" is that it is graphic beyond belief, and unrelenting. How anyone will be able to sit through this thing is the real mystery. There is blood, blood, everywhere. The violence toward Jesus is sadistic and grotesque. Basically, the entire second half of the film is spent watching Jesus endure physical torture never before seen in a movie. By the time it's done, actor James Caviezel's body is a map of bloody rivers and lakes with craters of flesh excised from his torso."  So now he objects that the crucifixion was brutal?  How can anyone object to the level of violence in the film?  Again, it's like filming Saving Private Ryan but making all the injuries in the Beach Landing superficial, and everyone lives happily ever after.  Or like the lack of pain, blood, and wwounds in the entire LOTR trilogy.  Plenty of people were crucified by Rome.  This is a fairly accurate account of how it was done to VIPs at the time.  I don't understand the objections.

       urlLink Op-Ed Columnist: Stations of the Crass   DOWD is her typical self this morning, flaying both Mel Gibson and Bush.  She manages to work he economy and Osama into what starts as a movie review of the Passion.  What is it about this movie?  I haven't seen it, and I don't share the faith, but it rubs me the wrong way when people try to tear it down.  It's a very important story, and this is simply Gibson's take on it.  He's entitled to make a movie with his own money.  Sure, his father's looney comments aren't helping him on the anti-semite angle, but since when do we condemn the son for the sins of the father?  I was watching Dennis Miller last night and some mild mannered looking Lefty spouted off about Gibson being a hatemonger, goose stepping and 'seig heil'-ing in the living room with his father.    Whether or not you believe Jesus is the Son of God, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that a man named Jesus was crucified under the circumstances portrayed in the Bible.  Are we to change the story because of the sentiments of people?  I can't imagine hating the Jews for their involvement.  Like Don has said many times, without Pilate and the Jewish urgings to kill Christ, what would we have?  God sent him here to go through the Passion, so shouldn't we also see the killers as part of God's Will?  The rampant hatred of this movie is bothering me, and I'm not sure why.  I guess I shouldn't really care, but I decided a long time ago that I respect people's faith (so long as that faith doesn't involve blowing up busses every day).  Gibson has made, by all accounts, a remarkable movie that is more important to him than anything he has ever done.  Shouldn't we respect the man for the power of his convictions?  As for DOWD, read her banality and there is little wonder she lives in an isolated New York bubble, surrounded by her fellow small minded intellectuals.  Has anyone in this group seen this thing yet?  Report back if you do.  I'm going to try to go this weekend.

But I did catch Gibson being interviewed by Diane Sawyer. I did something right when I came up with her, didn't I,” added God. “Anyway, as I was saying, Mel is a real nut case. What in the world was I thinking when I created him? Listen, we all make mistakes."   I only include it here because I really thought that Gibson did very well in the Sawyer interview.  He impressed me as a reasonable man following his own passion and beliefs in the face of ridicule and derision.

      Not so random thoughts.  I’m trying to get into the frame of mind to write this morning, and it just isn’t coming.  So I thought I’d just rattle off here and see if that loosens me up.  I had a good weekend.  My parents came up to visit for the weekend, and more specifically, my dad was here to help me get my basement organized.  If you don’t already know, our new house has a finished basement, but I have no book shelves for my vast collection.  It’s been difficult to live for the past year with all of my books boxed away and inaccessible.  In addition, the boxes have taken up space I would otherwise use for storage, so the basement as a whole has been a mess, and I’ve been frustrated by my efforts to clean and organize.  So dad came up to help me construct some shelves.  I’m inept when it comes to anything traditionally seen as ‘manly’ i.e. car repair, carpentry, etc…  I had sketched out my ideas for shelving using raw lumber, and we had agreed on a basic plan.  Considering the number of shelves I would require, it wasn’t economical to buy pre-made shelves.  In the end, the plan was to cover three walls of one room in the basement with floor to ceiling shelving, anchored to the wall for safety and stability.  I would end up with nearly 188 feet of shelving.    In addition, we built a workbench in the unfinished portion of basement, so I would have a place to sand and stain the shelving, as well as make a mess on future projects.  The table was impressive when we got it in place.  The table top is a 4’ by 8’ sheet of high quality pine, smooth and attractive, yet not so expensive that I have to fear damaging it.  The support structure is primarily stout 2”x 4” boards braced and fastened.  I could put everyone who reads this on top of that table and it wouldn’t even notice.  That part of the project went well.  In shopping for lumber, I realized I was going to have a problem.  The expense of the wood was simply higher than I had thought considering my minimal criteria for the quality of the board.  I couldn’t accept warping, twisting, or excessive surface defects.  We visited Home Depot, Lowes and a local lumber yard with the best price being $8.80 per 8’ board, giving me a total lumber budget of $240.  Not bad, but I was planning on about $6 per board.  We stopped at Menards, which was a first for me.  I had never been there, and I had no expectations of finding anything useful, given the reputation the store has here amongst the locals.  They look at it like a low rent Home Depot.  I wasn’t surprised to find that their lumber selection was quite poor, but on the way out we discovered something that made the trip worthwhile.  They had a sale going on prefabricated particle board shelving.  This was not my first choice, but I had to stop and consider the variables.  The particular color was exactly the shade I had planned on staining the raw board.  The thickness and density of the board were idea, and some experimentation with the 8’ lengths in the store suggested that I would have few issues with strength and bowing of the shelves under a load.  Finally, the price - $5 per board!  I would save money, avoid the chore of sanding and staining 200 feet of wood, and get some of my shelves built today rather than in a few weeks when the labor was complete.  So we purchased their entire inventory of 34 boards on the spot.  After making two trips to get it all home, and another hour of hauling them to the basement (they are quite heavy), we got started on the project.  There are some issues with assembling particle board, as it does lack the resiliency of normal wood when it comes to holding a screw, but we managed to cope once we understood the limits in screw size and depth.    We managed to get half of the project assembled and installed.  Each bookcase ‘unit’ (there will be five total) is anchored to the wall in the support studs using brackets.  The brackets also give each shelf some additional support.  In short, someone could climb the shelves like a ladder without fear of them tipping or falling apart.  I’m very pleased with the end result in terms of strength and aesthetics.  I’ll get a picture for those that are interested.  The rest of the project will have to wait a few weeks until I can get my dad back to help.  I could try to do the rest myself, but it requires two pairs of hands and some strength to lift them into place.  Finally, I am growing more frustrated in my Linux experiment.  I haven’t had much time this weekend to play with it, but after trying a few simple things in regards to my scanner, I decided to stop trying until the proper book arrives from Amazon, later this week.  Linux is just fine for simple things like email, web browsing and chatting.  OpenOffice is a fine MSFT Office substitute.  But when it comes to configuring hardware, installing packages or modifying settings, it is nothing like Windows.  Unfortunately, the book that got me started turned out to assume a basic knowledge of generic Linux, only trying to teach me the new version called Fedora.  So I ordered a more basic book and am waiting on it to arrive.  So until then, I’m somewhat crippled in my PC use, but if you look at the disaster of my basement at the moment, I have better things to work on.  So that’s it for my long, pointless post.  I hope you were at least entertained.

A few months ago, I finished Dan Simmons book, Ilium, which also revolved around Troy and the Iliad, and it whet my appetite.    So I picked this up and started on it over the weekend.    "Rage - Goddes, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles, murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses, hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls, great fighters' souls, but made thier bodies carrion, feasts for the dogs and birds, and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end. Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed, Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles."  Great stuff.  Achilles was the perfectly designed 'Greek-killing Machine'.  He doesn't just kill Greeks in small quantities. Rather he brings an modern assembly line efficiency to his Greek killing.

       urlLink NADER CANDIDACY!!   Oh, happy day! This article should be titled "Nader Helps Bush Win Re-Election." this is almost as good as Dean remaining in the campaign. Now the Angry Left can have its voice heard on the national stage.   Listen to the Democrat establishment try to discredit Nader:  "It's his personal vanity because he has no movement. Nobody's backing him," New Mexico Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson said.  i bet Nader does pretty good this time around. Not as good as in 2000, since the Angry Left will do anything to beat Bush, even pull the lever for Lurch, a.k.a. Kerry. But the true believers will go for Nader. honestly, I want them to! Everyone should vote on their principles, and it shows the utter lack of such in those who vote for no other reason than to get revenge on george W. Bush. I will continue to vote Libertarian, in the hopes that it might turn the Republicans away from the path of Big Government and towards a better path.  This coming campaign should be highly entertaining. I bet Bush dominates Kerry in debates. He has grown into his role as President, and it will show in the upcoming bruhaha.

      Don Barda informed me this morning that a man we used to work with at NAmSA in Toledo passed away on Thursday.  Dan Roman died of cancer, and I don't think he was probably more than 40 years old (not sure).  I didn't know Dan as well as I would have liked, but we spent my very first week in Atlanta together.  He was down helping with some facility related issues in the move from the old lab to the new facility in Kennesaw.  I got to know him enough to know that he was a good man, and I'm sad to hear of his passing.    It illustrates that we never know how much time we have.  Get busy living, while you still can.

      Novel update.  Although I didn't make a big deal of it, I essentially completed the first draft of the story this week.  That means I am moving toward the rewrite phase, where I will need readers to help keep me on track, as I had mentioned before.  I've been thinking about how to do this.  One idea is to initiate a new Blog, independent of this one, and post the segments of the story there.  The comment sections will serve as a review mechanism, with the added benefit of you guys being able to react to each others comments, and perhaps help me strengthen the story through any conversations that might take place.    The other method is to dispatch Word files every day or so to each of you via email, with return comments coming back the same way.    Those that plan on participating: do you have a preference?  As I have said, I appreciate any help you care to lend.

      My Linux Journal.  Well, last night I took the plunge and reformatted my computer.  I had intended to set up a dual boot with Windows, so I had a back up in case the Linux install didn't go well.  Also, if I needed to access the internet for drivers and such, I had that ability through Windows.  But I decided to install Linux by itself, just to see what would happen.  I figured if it was a disaster I can wipe and start over with the dual boot idea.  The install was super simple.  The system came right up and knew how to get to the internet.  It automatically updated the software through the Red Hat site, asking me for my root password to make sure I had the authority to change system software.  The graphical interface is very similar to Windows with some improvements.  It's going to take a long time for me to figure out the details.  Since it is Unix based, the command line is nothing like Dos.  All the commands are completely different.  An example was my attempt to get Flash working on my browser.  It requires a download, but it does not autoinstall like it does with Windows.  I have to expand the compressed file, then use a loader program in the command line to execute it.  As it is, I don't even know how to navigate to the file, let alone the actual location of the downloaded file!    But I understand the curve here.  The first time I ran a DOS/Windows PC, I had the same problem, so I'm just starting over with a new OS.  Actually, it is kind of exciting!  I did some reading last night and learned the proper commands, so tonight I should have it figured out.  Linux is peculiar if all you know is Windows, but I see why they have taken this path.  The fact that many programs have to be installed outside of the GUI is a trade for stability and security.  Also, the core of Linux is compiled for your specific hardware configuration.  If you install new hardware, you have to compile and install a new Kernel for your new configuration.  Where Windows stores thousands of drivers in the OS for every possible piece of hardware, your version of LInux only carries what you need.  It reduces bloat and increases stability, but again, you have to be prepared to recompile when you add hardware.  A trade.  So essentially, I have access to my email, internet and chat, but that's it for the moment.  I think I'll be learning something new everyday, which is actually kind of exciting when the computer was becomming more like an appliance as of late.  I'll keep you posted.

       urlLink IRAQ NOW ...... Media Analysis with a Sense of Insurgency :  This is from the Iraq blog I follow, written by an Officer in Iraq.  It provides a new perspective on what is going on over there, something the media tries to ignore.  Here's the quote.    "One American reader now living in Switzerland responds to yesterday?s post by writing,  "I thought President Bush was responsible for you going to Iraq, and you didn?t have a choice in the matter"  I had pegged you as too intelligent to volunteer for this mess."   Yes, President Bush is responsible for sending my unit to Iraq. But in September of 2002 I rescinded a letter of resignation I had put in that summer, precisely because I knew we were going to be mobilized, and see service in Afghanistan or Iraq. The politics were clear by September 2002: President Bush had staked his presidency on the removal of Saddam Hussein from power, and I told my NCO leadership that at the time, in those very words.  I could have let my resignation go through, and bowed out gracefully. But infantry officers move to the sound of the guns, and my commissioning oath required me to pledge that I ?take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation, or purpose of evasion.?   The letter reflects a common cynical, or even nihilist assumption which I do not share: that intelligent people do not seek to serve in a volunteer military, or that if they do, they fail to seek challenging and dangerous assignments.  The underlying assumption is that intelligent military leaders must fail to lead.   Intelligence is not the same thing as self-preservation.  Rather, I would suggest that when confronted with a totalitarian regime that practices systematic torture, rape, genocide, and murder, and which actively supports terrorist organizations which make a practice of setting off bombs on school busses abroad?and when offered a chance to help contribute to its demise?a truly intelligent man would discern a certain moral obligation.   And that equation is entirely"

Why not the private school if it provides a better value to the consumer?  The answers are simple, yet the Leftist will do all he can to deny them.  Let us choose.

       urlLink ABCNEWS.com : How Despairing Gibson Found 'The Passion'   I watched a large chunk of this interview last night, and I have to say I was impressed.  Mel Gibson has grown in stature with me, not only as an actor, but as a man.  It is often refreashing to discover that an admired actor actually has a brain and sense, when all too often they end up being infantile ravings fools.  Gibson showed himself to be a thoughtful man who isn't afraid to defend his views.  While I don't share his faith, I admire what he is doing with this film.  He is plowing $50 million of his own money into this, and I really don't think he gives a crap about the cash.  He wants people to see this because of his beliefs in Christ, so it is an attempt to spread his beliefs.  Again, I respect someone who does that.    But even more interesting is his determination to stick to his vision despite the shrieks of the critics.  They say the film is too violent (and from the clips I saw it was shocking), but what can be more violent to a believer than the crucifixion?  They say the film is inspiring hatred for the Jews, but who are the primary players in this region of the world at this time in history?  The local Jews did have a lot to do with Christ being 'given up' to the Romans.  Do we complain that civil war films portray whites as slave owners and abusers?  History is fact.  It was an excellent interview, and I wished I had joined it earlier.  As it is, I do plan on seeing the film.  The Christ story, even if you deny the spiritual side of it, contains power. It is important to a large segment of the population, and I am interested in seeing Gibson's version.

      I've had TWO failed posts now on the comments section below.  So I'm going to through this on the main page.  This is my response to Mark's question about how I would imagine a slave-less society.  Of course, the lost post was MUCH better than this one.  My idea of a free society requires the acknowledgement of responsibility that comes with freedom.  We must all be adult and accept the things that we must do for ourselves, and should we ignore the responsibility, we should be allowed to suffer the consequences of those actions.  Democracy.  I don’t believe in it.  I don’t think democracy in the way we are now practicing it is a good thing.  I think I’ve said it before – democracy leads to mob rule, where the will of the minority is plowed under by the momentary passions of the mob.    I believe in a nation of laws.  These laws should be minimal and damned difficult to change.  I would start with the Bill of Rights and stop there.  Very few laws are needed outside of that document.    I believe in representative government within the boundaries of the established laws.  I select someone whose job is to make sure no one messes around with the laws.  In the rare cases when a law needs to be changed, that representative is trusted to operate in the spirit of the Constitution.  That representative has a duty to ignore the majority if the majority is wrong, which is most of the time.  The will of the mob does not make something right if it is outside of the bounds of our law.  I guess I’m a hardcore Strict Constructionalist.  I believe that the Tenth Amendment invalidated 99.999% of all government activity in our lives.  None of it is legal in the strictest sense.  But as a society, we have abandoned the notion that our freedom carries responsibility.  We signed it all over to someone else, and began reaching into the ‘rich’ man’s pockets to pay for that which is our responsibility.   As for the idea of chaos and anarchy, I point you to the chaos of the marketplace.  From nothing but the free and voluntary choices made by people, we have a deca-trillion dollar economy churning away in mass chaos, but somehow providing goods and products, matching up buyers and sellers, and providing for the needs of all of us.  There is no central authority behind the market.  And there is no compulsion at work in the market.  Everyone is free to make their own choices.  I seek the same thing in the sector of life we have labeled as ‘public’.  Instead of shoveling all of our tax money into one big pit to be allocated at the whim of others, why can we not choose how to spend our money ourselves?  Why are we not trusted to be free with our choices?  Why can’t FedEx compete with the USPS when it comes to mail delivery?  Why can’t private companies compete to provide primary and secondary education, offering service for price and seeking to attract consumers?    How about an example.  Why can’t I pay a user fee for the roads based upon my odometer reading?  I utilized a certain amount of wear based upon my vehicle weight and miles driven.  I expect to pay for this service.    Why must I pay a property tax to fund a school when I am not utilizing that school?  I expect to pay directly for my child’s education.  I am responsible for it, so I should pay for it.  And my choice of schools should include schools ran for profit, competing to provide the best education and the best price.  I should have choices.  As for other public services, I DO believe in voluntary funding.  Like I said, part of being free is accepting the consequences of action.  As a sensible person, I would purchase Fire and Police protection to cover my family and property.  That is sensible.  I would expect the same of everyone else.  I would also be interested in voluntarily providing extra money that would help anyone in my area that may need some assistance in seeking similar coverage.  But if my neighbor refuses to purchase coverage despite being able to afford it, then he must suffer the consequences.  I would even like to see competition in fire prevention and police services.  If someone thinks they can provide a more efficient, better and safer police force, then let him have at it and try to get customers.  After all, the law is written down – we all are able to see what it says.    I want all ‘public’ services privatized and made voluntary.  I also want those that choose to ignore basic needs to suffer the consequences of their neglect.  It is part of being free.    I believe in the enlightened self-interest.  That is different than the animalistic self-gratification of those that ignore law and do what they please.  They are distinct.  I expect those that live to the law to prosper.  Those that refuse to accept their responsibilities should not be coddled and allowed to drain resources.  If you want to cover a person who refuses to pay for fire protection, what about health insurance, auto insurance, and so on?  If we accept that some people are too stupid or irresponsible to take care of the basic ‘public’ utility needs like educating their children, or providing for their own retirement, what else are you willing to pay for on their behalf?

      Why I am happy to be Ned Flanders on the piracy issue.  Wow, I’m taking a beating on Piracy, and I would be lying if I said it hasn’t bothered me all weekend.  To the point where I lost some sleep on Saturday.  I wasn’t going to prolong the debate, figuring it wouldn’t really accomplish much, but the more I think about it, and the more I read of your replies, I have to address some of what I see.  First, I respect everyone here, even those that wear the black eye patch and mutter ‘Arrrr’ when they download something.  That’s not going to change.  I’m not going to go around pointing fingers and denouncing you in the town square.  This isn’t an effort designed to allow me to sit back on my ‘high horse’ and sneer at the lesser beings.  What started as a theoretical debate exposed a major hole in my own belief system, and since my values are important to me, I concluded I have to repair the breech.    That led to the Blog action.  And the replies have been interesting.  Since arguing issues is what I do here, I’m going to volley back at all who replied.  Remember, the ground rules of the Blog require intellectual combat, so please don’t take offense.  As I assured Dave the other night, I take none myself, and enjoy the hard debate.  I’ve already established why I regret my piracy, and why I am trying to correct it.  I have already taken some steps, including the preparation to install Linux later his week and work towards learning it enough so I can dump Windows.  There’s no need to rehash my personal thoughts here, other than illustrating where I don’t agree with the comments I’ve seen.  Don tanked me on the behalf of Bill Gates and DMB.  I’m looking out for the vacation homes of the super wealthy.  I can only assume that the implication is: the wealthy have enough money, and my little contribution doesn’t mean much.  Additionally, I have inferred that Don thinks the money will simply be spent on yet another luxury item.  The wealth of my supplier has little to do with my decision to compensate them for their actions.  BG and DMB have supplied a service that I have elected to utilize, and that carries a price.  What they do with their profit means nothing to me.  I assume Don made commissions when he sold cars.  Does Don’s customer have a right to inquire what Don intends to do with his earnings? Should he refuse to buy if Don is going to spend the money on hookers?  The rule here is simple – the product carries a price that is well known.  I choose whether or not to purchase at the stated price.    As for Don’s comments about helping the poor or paying for education, I can only point back to my argument that these transactions should be freely chosen.  My objection to the funding levels of social programs and education stem more from the concept that the funding is obtained through confiscation of wealth at the point of a gun.  The government uses the power of force (imprisonment) to extract the funds from the populace.  The two issues have no linkage.  Dave rails against the high salaries of the content authors, as well as the ‘greed’ of the rich.  Go get Wall Street and listen to Gordon Gekko for my refutation of the concept of greed.  Greed is, indeed, good.  But to be fair, Dave is probably defining greed as some sort of forceable extraction of money from people who don’t want to provide it.  Hmm…wouldn’t the government be the greedy party here?  Ahnuld makes a movie.  The study puts a price on it.  If you don’t like the price, don’t see it!  How much more simple does it have to be?  You have a choice.  You are free to refuse to pay.  ‘Greed’ would be a case where attendence was mandatory and the price was jacked up because you must go.  Drivers license fees are GREED, because you pretty much HAVE to have one.  A movie ticket is optional last time I looked.  As for the salaries of Ahnuld and his ilk, again – what business is it of yours?  Ahnulds salary has no impact on you.  His salary is set by whatever the market will accept.  Whoever pays his salary does so because it is a bargain.  They will get more out of his services than they would out of that same $30 million sitting in the bank.  Ahnuld has proven his ability to provide a greater rate of return than most investments.  That is the essence of capitalism.  Dave mentioned that the stars are raping their customers.  Again, explain to me how this is the case in a voluntary system?  You have no inherent right to entertainment.  It costs what it costs.  If you object, you have a perfectly acceptable conduit to view his movie for little to no cost – wait for it to be on TV, or wait for it to go to rental.  You do NOT have the right to download it.  I don’t care what you say – it is theft.    Mark makes the case that piracy can be noble.  I agree that iTunes would not exist without the piracy market, but that does not excuse the pirates.  Should we thank burglars for the growth in security technology?  Should we thank car thieves for the invention of LoJack?    And again, I don’t get the idea that the industry is taking advantage of me.  A CD has a cost.  They are charging what people are willing to pay at the margin.  The price may be high enough to stop you from buying it, and you might be angry that you don’t have the cheap access you crave, but there are still plenty of people willing to spend $200 a week on music.  So long as the supply of willing spenders exist, the price will remain where it is.  The industry is there to make money, as you know.  They aren’t there to gouge and rape.  They are going to extract the maximum profit they think the market will provide.  Are you interested in making as much salary as you think your employer is willing to pay?  What’s the difference between the two?  In all cases, the terms are voluntary on both sides.  No one is forced to pay.  As for measuring myself as a ‘man’ – yes, this is what I’m doing.  I’m trying to be consistent with my beliefs.  What would you all think of me if I professed these beliefs, but then maintained a vast archive of stolen material?  But more important than what you think – I have to grapple with what I think, since I am responsible for myself.  I own me, so I must answer to me.  And what other things are more important in measuring myself than the ideas of respecting the labor of others, and paying for the things I utilize?  It is my personal choice, just as it is your choice.   And Steve.  You mentioned that if we could get away with stealing a Mercedes, most people would do it.  That might be true, and I am sad to hear it.  If the only think keeping us from stealing is the disapproval of others, then we have lost the concept of self-ownership.  It means that the will of the majority is more important to each of us then our own desire.  We should not steal because of our own internal beliefs, not because of the wrath of the mob.  It SHOULD be more important to each of us in our own self-regard.  It goes back to the concept of slavery, yet again.  If I have no qualms about taking the labor of others with no compensation, it shouldn’t bother me that others regard me as a slave to their whims.     Maybe I am sounding like some self-righteous bastard here.  I’m no better than anyone else.  I don’t think of myself as some enlightened being.  I’m just trying to sort out what is important to me, and adjusting my life accordingly.  In regards to you guys, all I really want to do is put out the ideas and have an honest accounting of what it means to pirate material.

      Why I believe that taxation is a form of slavery.  OK, I’ve taken a beating on the piracy thing, and I’m going to respond to all of you here in a few moments.  But I realize that I can’t effectively respond until I offer a satisfactory rationale for why I believe that any form of taxation (as well as any form of theft) is really a form of enslavement.  And in my mind, slavery is one of the worst crimes imaginable.  I need to try to explain this in a way to get through to Steve, because he isn’t buying the argument.  Taxation is a means by which the government extracts money from the citizens to use in whatever way they see fit.  The government cannot spend one dime without taking that money from another person.  We have all become too comfortable with the concept that the money taken from us was never really ours to begin with.  How many people know how much you pay in taxes?  Do you know your gross pay, or your net?  The missing money isn’t even on your radar, so you don’t really worry about it.    What is your pay?  It represents the time and labor you have traded.  You come into work and produce a product or man a computer, and your employer provides money in exchange for this activity.  Yet, the taxman steps in and takes a chunk of your money, representing your time and labor.    Let’s make it more obvious by changing things a little.  Let’s say Dave travels the town repairing heating and air conditioning units.  At the end of each job, he is handed food, or CDs, or some other good that he wants.  Each time he works, he gets something that meets his needs.  But at the end of every day, he has to go visit one customer and spend a quarter of his day working there.  At the end of that job, he is shoved out the door for no compensation.  He is requires by law to work for this customer every day, without being paid.  He MUST do this because society has said he must give his time without pay.  Society has established ownership over a large chunk of Dave’s life.  The faceless mob is saying that they have the right to own the product of your labor, and you have no choice but to comply.  Is this not slavery?  But you say that as a society, we have decided to accept this.  So therefore it is a happy slavery, one entered into with eyes open and hearts light.  We happily toil for the good of us all, casting aside our individuality for the betterment of the group.    Before I address this, I have to lie out another point.  The most fundamental of human rights is the idea of freedom.  As free men, we answer to no one else when it comes to what we do with our own time and labor.  Provided we do not infringe upon the basic human rights of others, we are free to do whatever we choose.  Being free means not being owned by anyone, including ‘society’.  The mob has no claim on the labor of a free man.  Therefore, while you might say we are laboring for the good of society, that decision has been taken from us.  Collectively, we vote for representatives who then decide to tax us for whatever program might be popular.  However, if a man votes that he does not wish to contribute his labor towards a particular thing, his wishes are ignored should the mob decide to support the taxation.  The man’s right to own himself has been taken from him, and a burden is placed on his labor.  Suddenly, Dave has to work a little longer for the non-paying customer, regardless of Dave’s desire to do so.  The only just system taxes the willing.  Those that vote to tax themselves should be taxed.  Those that chose to be free, should be free.  You might complain that under such a system, no programs will be funded, and no one would ever be taxed.  I answer by saying YES.  That is the goal.  People should be free to determine for themselves where their money should be spent.  Should a man choose to hand 20% of his money to PBS, he is free to do so.  Should another man decide to invest his money in a new business that is his decision as well.  Only by the free choice of free men, we can have a just society.    The very concept of a majority vote enslaving the unwilling is anathema to my beliefs.  What is wrong with the prospect that self-ownership cannot be taken away?  Why do we accept that 50% + 1 vote has the right to consign us to work for the non-paying customer?    For the ‘good of society’?  For the benefit of all?  Again, who owns you? Are you an individual or are you a part of a group?  I submit that we all can do more for society by pursuing our own self interests.  Any takers on that debate?  Any form of taxation to support a program that you do not agree with is slavery.  Pure and simple.  If you state that this is a necessity of life, then all I ask is for you to admit that slavery itself is a necessary evil.  Acknowledge that the fundamental premise of taxation policy is no better than 17th century slavery.

      Editor from the Cleveland Plain Dealer...  While looking for articles on the library levy, I saw this from the blog of the plain dealer, this is a shocking to me, an editor not afraid to ask what all the fuss is about, the same fuss that is selling his paper!   Wednesday, February 11, 2004     SERVICE RECORD I read with growing disbelief the escalating debate over the military service of George Bush and John Kerry.   The President served in the Air National Guard during the Viet Nam War. Sen. Kerry was a Naval officer in Viet Nam and was decorated for his combat service.  Bush detractors say he was AWOL during a portion of his Guard service and, in essence, dodged service in Viet Nam.  Kerry detractors say he should be condemned for his denunciation of the war after his discharge.  As someone who didn't try hard enough to get a deferment or find a refuge in some socially acceptable form of service such as the National Guard, I wound up going into the Army, getting commissioned and serving in Viet Nam.  Like almost everyone I served with, I envied the Guardsmen who missed Viet Nam. And like the vast majority of Americans, I opposed the war.  Those who actually served opposed it with a bit more passion as did their loved ones. My wife's car, for example, bore a bumper sticker common to the time: "Another Mother for Peace."  So to Bush's detractors: Why demean him for doing what anyone with any sense would have done? If you can escape getting shot at by an angry enemy, why not?  And to the Kerry detractors: Why demean his valiant service because he had the good sense afterward to denounce a stupid war?  What riles me about Bush is his refusal to admit that his Guard Service was a Viet Nam avoidance plan. It riles me because there's nothing wrong with such a plan. Millions of young men did some version of it.  And what riles me about the attacks on Kerry's post-service anti-war stance is that it was too late in coming, though for all I know he was just like every other GI over there. He wanted out and the war to end. And what was wrong with that?  The problem with Bush admitting the truth, I guess, is that it might seem unmanly to some and, in light of his sending young men off to war, hypocritical.  Healthy fear of real danger isn't unmanly, it's logical.  I'll leave the determination of hypocrisy to others.

      My novel.  Most of you probably know that I have been working on this for some time now.  I am presently at the 172,000-word mark, and the end is within sight.  I expect to have the first draft complete within 5 weeks.  At that point, the rewrite begins.  I am seeking help, and I will accept it from any who offer.  I will be working towards a goal of 1,000 words each calendar day in the rewrite process.  I need readers who can absorb my daily output, read it thoroughly, and provide thoughtful, constructive criticism.  Those critics must also be prepared to accept the idea that I might ignore their critiques in favor of my own judgment.  I need replies quickly as I work through this project, and I hope to produce material just as quickly.  To those that help, I can offer little more than my appreciation, and perhaps a mention in print should I ever get lucky enough to make it.  If you are interested, let me know.  I believe Steve and Mark have already agreed, but I’ll take anyone else who can help.

      Over the past day or so, I’ve been talking with Mike online about my new stance on piracy.  The more I’ve talked to him, the more I’m convinced my new position is the only position that is consistent with that which I believe.  I’ve been quite a pirate.  I have around 60 GB of music, dozens of DVD movie copies, and around 70 GB of software.  I’ve used Macromedia to make money.  I don’t know how many other programs I’ve cracked for my own use.  So why the change?  Because I realized that not only is piracy wrong, it destroys the pirate.  I wish to live consistent to my own beliefs.  Those beliefs demand that no one has the right to place an unwanted claim against my time or labor.  I own myself, and I answer only to myself and those that I choose to allow claim to me (family and in a more limited sense, friends.).  Just as I demand to own myself, I may make no claim against another man.  I will not own other people, in whole or in part.  Until I find the respect for others, I am false to my own beliefs.  I am less of the man I want to be.  And that clashes with the idea of piracy.  What right do I have to make Bill Gates my slave?  Or Dave Matthews?  What claim do I have upon their work without just compensation?  How can I justify this?  Some say that their piracy is small.  Just one person stealing XP isn’t a big deal.  In the grand scheme of things, it isn’t.  But it harms you for doing it.  By submitting to the desire to own someone else, you are submitting to the idea that people CAN be owned; that it is permissible to seize someone else’s labor for no better reason that ‘I can’.    Some claim that the products cost too much, and somehow this gives you the justification to take from others.  Should you steal a Mercedes because you cannot afford one?  Should you expect to buy groceries according to what you can afford, getting a loaf of bread cheaper than the next man because you make less?  Or do you have the right to just take it, because you can?  The price is the price.  It is fair.  Should the price be too high, then you should not purchase or partake.  Find an alternative, and be consistent with the idea that you own yourself, and you own no one else.  Some just don’t care.  They want all they can get, for their own amusement.  I was like this.  I amassed things I would never use, just because I could.  But there is no justification behind this thievery.  Nothing you can say will justify enslaving other men for your amusement.  You are poisoning yourself by debasing the ideas of freedom.  Maybe you can sleep with that on your head, but you cannot claim to seek freedom so long as you continue to enslave others.  This is going to be hard.  I’ve been taking inventory at home and trying to figure out what I must buy to maintain the computer experience I am accustomed to, and it is going to be very difficult.  But part of being true to your belief means doing the hard thing, even if you don’t have to.  I will be looking at Linux and other alternatives over the next few weeks.  I downloaded iTunes and began to examine what it would take to legitimize the music I wish to have.  It isn’t going to be cheap, and I don’t really have the money to blow on this.  So I will make choices, deleting what I can do without, and even what I wish to keep.  But until I do this, I can’t consider myself complete.  I hope this doesn’t sound ‘high and mighty’ or sanctimonious.  I’m not urging anyone to abandon piracy for my sake.  I’m hoping you examine your own values and decide if piracy is consistent with what you want to be as free men.  Make your own choices.  My purpose here is to explain to myself what I’m doing, and to give you all someone to laugh at in my struggle.

       urlLink Ananova - Saddam's aide says dictator was 'heavily into drugs'   You see? Another good reason to have toppled Saddam. Not only was it for the War on Terror, but the War on Drugs as well. It has the added bonus of ending Saddam's dependence on drugs. Maybe now he can get the treatment he needs.  Seriously, though. This is yet another reason Saddam was dangerous. Just as Hitler became irrational through his dependence on drugs, we can assume Saddam wasn't rational either. Did we want to leave someone so unstable in a position to harm us?

       urlLink Most Think Truth Was Stretched to Justify Iraq War (washingtonpost.com)   The cries of Bush Lied!!! continue anabated. It seems the Leftists' plan to defeat Bush is to make him out to be an even bigger liar than their man. How pathetic. They cannot debate the issues, they cannot offer solutions to any problems, so they must denigrate their opposition.  How will electing John Fing Kerry help the country? Why should we try to get back at Bush if he lied? If we take recent history as an example to follow, then Bush should be praised for his adroit telling of falsehoods just as Bill Clinton was. After all, he only comitted perjury and made a mockery of the office of the President. I can hear it now, though. "Bush killed 500 Americans and thousands of Iraqis for a Lie!"  The knowledge at the time led us to believe that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Saddam lied! He wanted us to believe it. If it wasn't true, then he should have proven it. But he decided to call our bluff. How should we have reacted then? Should we have backed down and shown ourselves weaker than some thug running a third-rate country? When Saddam refused to fully cooperate, he had to be attacked. Our credibility and position were at stake.  Five hundred Americans is a high price to pay for victory. And the price hasn't been paid in full. But what was the price of failure? Who can say what a defiant Saddam would be up to today? With the War on Terror in full swing, Iraq could have sheltered countless enemies of the U.S. Syria and Iran no doubt are doing that very thing right now. But Saddam and Iraq are not, and that is a good thing.  There were intelligence failures over Iraq. But the enemies of America would paint that as a reason to attack the CIA. I see it as a reason to strengthen it. The CIA is a necessary tool in our defense. The world is a terrible place, and we must be constantly vigilant for danger. Assasinations, bribery, threats, and all manner of distasteful things must be done to keep our citizens safe. The projection of our power is the best way to ensure our safety and prosperity. Those who oppose that oppose our nation. By all means let a probe commence. But the results should spur a building up of the intelligence angencies, not a tearing down. It is obvious they were hamstrung by the previous administration. With our new focus on global terror it is imperative we restore our CIA as something to be feared by our enemies.  Look at this crap: "Questions about Bush's use of prewar intelligence, in addition to feeding doubts about his honesty, have sent his performance rating plummeting. Fifty percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing, the lowest level of his presidency in Post-ABC polling and down 8 percentage points from January. The survey found that, for the first time since the war ended, less than half of Americans -- 48 percent -- believe the war was worth fighting, down 8 points from last month. Fifty percent said the war was not worth it. "  I sometimes wonder if America is worth defending at all. It seems that every other person I meet thinks it isn't. I don't believe that we should have fought the war to bring Democracy to the Middle East. I think they are not ready. But we should have fought it to topple Saddam. And to show the world that we mean business. This threat of violence has already brought results. Libya is trying to get in our good graces. That's progress, folks!  These poll numbers really only describe the stupidity of Americans. Both their socialist leanings towards the Democratic Party and their gullibility to the mainstream media are apparent in these numbers.   "These doubts have affected Bush's reelection prospects. In a head-to-head matchup, Kerry beat Bush, 52 percent to 43, percent among registered voters. Bush had more passionate support -- 83 percent of his backers said their support was strong, while 59 percent of Kerry supporters said so -- and retains an advantage over Kerry in dealing with Iraq and the war on terrorism. But the Democrat was seen as better able to handle the economy and jobs, education, and health care -- all top issues with voters this year. "  Kerry's supporters only use him as a surrogate to defeat Bush. Notice that all the three "top issues" are basically handouts. People want the Federal Government to hand them a easy job for life. They want the Federal Government to give them a free ticket to college. They want the Federal Government to give them free cradle to grave healthcare. All of this is of course piad for by theft! Kerry's slogan should be "Vote for me, I'll steal from your neighbor!" Not that Bush has done any better with his "Compassionate Conservatism." His new entitlements alone do far more damage to our future than anything since Medicare. But at least he can lead us in the fight on global terror. The Democrats may be able to as well, but if you believe their rhetoric they would have never gone into Iraq. They seem to think weakness is strength. Do you want that in charge of our national defense?  I want you to forget the idea that anyone else should provide for your job, your education, or your healthcare. Do you want to be a dog? Becuase a dog just wants a kind master. A dog wants the same things most Americans seem to want. A dog cannot provide those things for itself, but a man can. Stand up for yourselves and stop stealing from your fellow citizens to provide for your wants.

       urlLink Amazon.com: Books: Inversions   What I'm reading now.    This is yet another acquisition at the used book store.  The White Plague, just completed, turned out to be horrible.  The last two hundred pages were a test of endurance.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Iain Banks is an author I discovered a few years ago, and he writes very interesting hard SF with high themes and interesting settings.  This one seems to promise a more nuanced character interaction, judging from the reviews.  I'm looking forward to it.

       urlLink ISC 17 - Library privatisation: fact or fiction? :   Stirring the Library issue again.  I found this from a British site called Information for Social Change.  Their links page can be found here.   urlLink  Links    "Do we really want to see public libraries change into commercial, moneymaking enterprises, where the wants and needs of the local community get lost amongst the pound notes? Do we really want to lose the opportunity that the public library offers for ordinary people to be able to think and debate issues, to pursue various leisure pursuits and to obtain information? It might not be ideal, but what is round the corner, and in fact, is already staring us in the face is the business takeover of public libraries. The primary goal of these private operators is and must always be to make profits, which conflicts with goals about serving the wants and needs of the local community, caring for people and notions of equality and social justice.

      A resolution.  The more I've thought about this today, the more I realized I must do this.  And now that I've embraced the idea, it feels pretty good.  I will never borrow a book again.  I will begin screening my music collection for files I do not already own on CD, and I will start deleting them.  I will dispose of all DVD copies of movies that I possess.  And I'm going to begin deleting ISO files of any software I do not already own.  It is the proper thing to do, and I need to live consistently with my own values.    I should pay for that which I enjoy.  It's the only correct thing to do.  I'm serious about this.  It's time.

       urlLink USATODAY.com - Supreme Court revisits library porn filter debate   Should public libraries have porn filters on their computers?  Should public libraries even provide Internet access at all?    I bring this up because of a recent case in Philadelphia, somewhat similar to the Carlie Brucia murder in Flordia.  A homeless man with a past record trapped an eight year old girl in the library bathroom, raped her and nearly choked her to death.  This monster has a previous charge of assault, but was acquitted when the traumatized girl could not identify him beyond doubt.  This loser spends most of this time in the library viewing porn and performing related activities, ahem, in public.  The library position is that they frequently ask him to leave, but cannot ban him from the building as it is a public place.  In the words of the library representative, ‘he did not pose an imminent threat’.  Does that sound familiar?    Anyway, the presence of porn may be incidental to this particular case, but it got me thinking about the issue again.  Why is it even available?  What public interest is served by this access in a public place, on public computers?  And for that matter, why do we even have public Internet access?  There is a USA today article where they interview a library patron on the topic, and he spends most of his time in the library playing games on the net.  Is that a proper use of tax-funded resources?  The official American Library Association (ALA) position opposes filters.  To them, it is a freedom of speech issue.  They feel the Constitution protects the publics right to have access to this material.  Does this also mean that the library should carry other media of this nature?  Magazines, DVDs, tapes etc.?  Does Freedom of Speech compel others to fund speech they don’t wish to be associated with?  What right does the library have to divert public finds to this sort of activity?  I’m not arguing against the popularity of libraries.  Just because people want something doesn’t make it morally sound.  My question revolves around the primary issue of compulsion.  From where do we draw the thinking that access to information is a fundamental right, compelling others to pay for our access?  If someone wishes to engage in questionable viewing on the Internet, why do they think they have the right to do this on public computers?  Let them pay the $19.95 a month and do it in their own home.  If they can’t afford it, well…. that’s his own problem, not mine.  But what about the chilrun!?  I can already hear it.  What of the poor children who want to research Thomas Jefferson and lack access to the Net.  In this case, I fully support a school library system, closed to the public and stocked for the purpose of education.  In that case, I support the availability of access, along with appropriate filters.  I think it is completely appropriate for children to have access to educational material in a library system, but I can’t support a public library system that promotes copyright infringement.  Whoa.  Where did that come from?  Most of you who know me have already heard this argument, so I’ll be brief.  I don’t believe it is correct to make copyrighted material available for free in the public library system.  Sure, it might be funded by tax payers, and the copyright holder may get paid, but they only get paid for limited copies of the text or media.  If I write a novel, why should I permit it to be freely available to anyone who wishes to read it without paying me for the reading?  If someone borrows my book, they are not going to buy a copy, compensating me for my work.  I have lost a sale.  How is that different from Napster, other than the technology?  If an adult wishes to read a book, they should pay for the reading.  Period.  Anything else is theft.  The book contents are not public domain.  Same for movies, art, newspapers and so on.    What public interest is served when I can watch a tape of Star Wars for free at the library?  Is Lucas compensated for that viewing?  How can you morally defend the ongoing ‘theft’ of this material?  So, circling back to school libraries, I have no issue with the availability of source materials to children for the purposes of education.  Kids aren’t going to have the money to spend on the materials, and most content producers would agree that providing this material to this audience is worth doing, since those kids will grow up to be consumers.  Many industries see the wisdom of taking a loss in this market to generate future gains.  Do you think Microsoft gives away Office out of the goodness of their heart, or do they want kids to grow up ‘locked in’ to MS software?  It makes sense.  Therefore, I don’t believe in public libraries.  And I certainly don’t believe in Internet access.  Flame away, because I would love to hear the moral justification for taking public funds to erect buildings dedicated to stealing from content creators.

      My meeting with Jeff Hughes at the SPSU Career and Counseling Center was very productive. He shared his experience of being an accountant for 20 yrs, then making the shift into counseling. He was very supportive and understanding of my situation. He offered the following suggestions:  1. Go to the Georgia Career Information Center website. I haven't looked at it yet, but he told me it allows for a comparison between professions. Also it has extensive data on salaries, education, opportunities, and other facts about careers in the state of Georgia. 2. Talk with the faculty on-campus at the Technical Communications department. Ask them about their experiences and backgrounds. Discuss the possibilities not just in TCom, but in writing and communications in general. 3. Visit with the faculty of other universities. Seek out advanced students who are about to graduate from degree programs that interest me. Find out what they would do differently or the same.  4. Seek out professionals in the fields that interest me. Ask to interview them for information or tag along with them for a portion of their day to see what their duties are like. Ask them what they like or dislike about their job and their industry in general.  So in the next few days I will be doing just that. The website sounds like a great source of information. We discussed when it might be prudent for me to change my major and transfer to another school. Six weeks or so is the time frame for the Summer Semester.   To sum it up, I went in being lost, and came out with a better understanding of how to find the path. I promised to get back with Mr. Hughes when I am more certain of the path I am going to take. He was a good guy, and really wanted to help me.

      I sound pessimistic and angry mainly because I despise the inaction of the populace of America. I hope for edification and see only dissolution. People race to embrace carnal and base pleasures, when those are the dreams of brute beasts. What separates most people from dogs? Not much that I can tell. Both seem to be after a full stomach, a warm place to sleep, and approval in society. Though I myself seek many of these things, I realize that there is much more to the human condition than these simple desires.   I think freedom is the highest ideal and the best possible state for a sentient being to live in. But so few people understand or desire it. They go through life merely existing, seeking the path of least resistance. They do what they are told, or what is expected of them. I think sheep do the same thing. Those who seek the truth, who follow their dreams over the horizon are despised by these "sheep" because their strength illustrates the sheep's weakness.   I want to be free. Free of control by others. Free of the compulsion to labor for someone else. I want to own myself. I will not do what anyone else wants me to do! I will do what I want to do! This isn't mere rebelliousness, or the angry ranting of some child. So many people are unhappy because they are slaves. Slaves to their lives, to the place they occupy in the machinery of Society. They are prisoners of their minds. Religion, family, politics, marriages, children - all these things can hold us hostage as surely as a terrorist. I refuse to let such things hold sway over me!   I define my own reality. This very moment, the second you are reading this is the only one that matters. All that came before or might come is nothing but an illusion. So make your own reality! Stop being a slave to the past, or to some illusory future. My life before now was nothing. It doesn't exist. It's only purpose was to set me where I am now. What I do from here is my own choice.   I do not know what profession I want to pursue. I do not know what I will be doing in five or ten years. But I will always seek what it is that I want. I will remain free to make my own choices. I will be open to radical shifts in lifestyle, purpose, and thought. Past positions, successes, failures all mean nothing when I choose what to do now.   I admire the writers of the US Constitution because they sought to set men free. Since perfect freedom is not possible, they had to form a system that restricts the ability of men to enslave one another and allows them to choose their own way of life. There is no freedom without the law! I embrace the need for laws, for order in the universe. I cannot be free unless there are boundaries for my behavior. I accept these boundaries. In an ideal world, every person who reaches voting age would have to accept or deny the authority of government. An oath of fealty, separating those who enter willingly into a social compact with one another from those who do not care to be free.   Of course, those men that formed the most perfect government yet seen were also highly educated. They studied the lessons of the past, and considered the trials of the future. Those who seek to discard the experience of the past in favor of untried theories should be prepared to retreat back to the established truths when their ideas fail. I oppose the leftists concepts of handouts and equality because those ideas have been proven to enslave us. Gifts make a slave of those who accept the gifts. That which is not earned is resented. An imposition of equality destroys the desire to improve one's condition. Since society is a group of individuals, this destruction of free will surely leads to the destruction of a society.   I believe the fundamental concept of the Constitution was to protect us from one another. The rule of the majority was to be constrained by the three branches, by the bicameral legislature, and by the competition over power by greedy men. I desire gridlock in government. In my ideal world, it would be weeks between noticing the Federal Government existed. It would be days at least for State government. I feel the only legitimate purposes of government are to protect our freedoms and our lives from outside threats. Note I say "outside." This means protecting us from other individuals and groups that seek to do us harm. This is not protecting us from our own mistakes! I want to be free to hurt myself, just as I want to be free to improve myself. One cannot exist without the other! When you begin to exert authority over someone's body, you own them! They become your chattel. And it is a truly terrible realization I have come to that the people around me think they have a right to own me.  The only control I want over others is to keep them from controlling me. Those that bombinate about things like "giving back" or "those more fortunate" only want to control me. I refuse to take from someone else that which they earned for themselves! It is morally wrong. It is the very definition of evil. Doing it collectively or authorizing some government entity to do it for you does not make it any different. You who would steal from others are the worst thing on this earth! Why not just kill them and steal their belongings? It would be more honest than seeking to make them your slaves. Own yourself! Own your choices and your life! Wealth, happiness, and possessions are not the purposes of life! Taking them from others will not fulfill your purpose! Only by finding your own path and living your life free of bondage to others will bring you true joy.  If you blame your unhappy state on others you are lying to yourself. Happiness is a transient state. But following your dreams, being an individual in control of your own choices is an eternal state of happiness. Failures and successes are events on any path. We impose on ourselves the constraints that prevent us from being happy. The prison is of our own making. It is a cell with walls between our ears. Taking from others will not set us free. Converting others to our beliefs will not set them free. Bringing low those who are exalted and raising up those who are despised will not free us. Only a knowledge and understanding of true liberty can free us from ourselves.   I seek to be free. I seek a higher state of being. My life will be my own. No man will own me! I do realize that it is merely a dream. It cannot be realized in this world I find myself in. But that does not discourage me from the pursuit of my ideal! The darkness does not diminish the light. I know now what it is I want. I know what state I desire for myself. No matter what others do or say or impose on me, I will persist in my dream of freedom. I will refuse to rule over others, though they might wish it on themselves. I will refuse to allow my mind to be ruled over by those who seek lordship over me. My body cannot be free of the shackles that those who are stronger than me seek to impose. Taxation is an evil that I cannot escape. Collective serfdom is a shackle I cannot throw off. But my mind is free! Though I be taxed to fund those who enslave me, I will never willingly submit to it. To throw off that shackle would be only to invite a more restrictive set of shackles. So I endure my bondage.  I leave you with the thought that true freedom is the most perfect state of existence. When we can own ourselves and no one else, then we can be said to be free. Then we can be happy.

      From ABC News's blog, "The Note":  Like every other institution, the Washington and political press corps operate with a good number of biases and predilections.   They include, but are not limited to, a near-universal shared sense that liberal political positions on social issues like gun control, homosexuality, abortion, and religion are the default, while more conservative positions are "conservative positions."   They include a belief that government is a mechanism to solve the nation's problems; that more taxes on corporations and the wealthy are good ways to cut the deficit and raise money for social spending and don't have a negative affect [sic] on economic growth; and that emotional examples of suffering (provided by unions or consumer groups) are good ways to illustrate economic statistic stories.   More systematically, the press believes that fluid narratives in coverage are better than static storylines; that new things are more interesting than old things; that close races are preferable to loose ones; and that incumbents are destined for dethroning, somehow.   The press, by and large, does not accept President Bush's justifications for the Iraq war--in any of its WMD, imminent threat, or evil-doer formulations. It does not understand how educated, sensible people could possibly be wary of multilateral institutions or friendly, sophisticated European allies.   It does not accept the proposition that the Bush tax cuts helped the economy by stimulating summer spending.   It remains fixated on the unemployment rate.   It believes President Bush is "walking a fine line" with regards to the gay marriage issue, choosing between "tolerance" and his "right-wing base."   It still has a hard time understanding how, despite the drumbeat of conservative grass-top complaints about overspending and deficits, President Bush's base remains extremely and loyally devoted to him--and it looks for every opportunity to find cracks in that base.   Of course, the swirling Joe Wilson and National Guard stories play right to the press's scandal bias--not to mention the bias towards process stories (grand juries produce ENDLESS process!).   The worldview of the dominant media can be seen in every frame of video and every print word choice that is currently being produced about the presidential race.   Me: Wow! This is a good and mostly honest acknowledgement of bias by the media itself. Notice that all their desires are basically pessimistic and destructive. They want to tear down the establishment, to decry the squalor they see all around us, and to fight for radical social and moral change. Remember this bias permeates everything you see on the "news" and read in print.

'If President Bush thought that his release of selected payroll and service records would quell the growing controversy over whether he ducked some of his required service in the Air National Guard three decades ago, he is clearly mistaken. '  He's mistaken because the Times won't let this one die.  'Whether Mr. Bush actually performed his Guard service to the full is a different matter. It bears on presidential character because the president has continually rejected claims that there was anything amiss about his Guard performance during the Alabama period.'  Presidential Character?!  The Times had no problems with Clinton's little lapse of character.  We had evidence to prove he lied.  And now we have evidence to prove that Bush served honrably.  But don't let that get in the way of an agenda.  Steve, have you found your 'reasoned' Democrat yet?  I think it's time you make a conclusion and move on.

      The promised Report of the class discussion of alien intelligence and possible ramifications.  As expected, very little actually got said. Many nitpickers worrying about the details. Only one or two people seemed to care at all about the concept itself. The expected cry of "feed the chilrun" was heard. I did my best to point out that no money would be diverted from their needy, greedy little mouths, but that some tiny fraction of the Federal pie would be put to noble use. That was the last talk of money concerns.  One of the two professors questioned my emphasis on Federal control over space exploration, pointing out that for a long time now private companies have been putting things into space. I countered that I wasn't talking about satellites, but in putting men on Mars; on grand prokects that honestly offer little financial incentive for thier undertaking. I advanced the idea of a NASA-pioneered endeavor to be followed by private exploitation of the newly viable tech. But that was too complex apparently because those who responded acted like I said nothing.  One professor seems preoccupied with religion, so his contribution was to ask how I thought discovery would impact religions. I said they would all adapt. People would persist in their illusions. There was some more discussion on this, but I didn't really care much so I forgot it.  Really, we missed the idea that space MUST be explored. we seemed to get sidetracked to areas I didn't care about. I wish I could have had total control over the class. Even more, I wish those mutes would care about it and speak up.

      Are we ready to accept the idea of alien intelligent life?  We’ve toyed with the idea in the popular culture for at least fifty years, and most people have probably given it serious thought in the last ten years.  You would think that when (okay, ‘if’) the announcement does come, most would nod their heads and move on with life.    But I don’t think most people really have considered the ultimate ramifications of such a discovery.  I don’t think I’ve even given it the full consideration that it deserves, beyond the simple desire to see it happen at some point in my life.  What will it mean to us?  There is little doubt that it will mark the most fundamental shift in our paradigm.  As of that moment, time will be divided into two passages, ‘before’ and ‘after’.  But I think that will only be realized after the passage of a considerable amount of time.  In the years afterward, people will not view the announcement with such a perspective.  It will be big news, but inside of six months, we will be discussing the BUSH LIES once again.    But what would it ultimately mean to us in terms of culture, society, religion, and practical life?  I’m going to establish some conditions that seem likely for our First Contact.  I don’t believe they are going to show up in DC and say ‘Klaatu barada nikto’ on the South Lawn.  I don’t think they are going to talk to us directly.  We will discover indirect evidence; the presence of radio transmissions or some sort of analog.  It will be decades or centuries before we actually manage to get their attention.  Alternatively, they have heard our transmissions and are either ignoring us, or preparing their own response and it even now is heading our way.    They will be intelligent, and that will mean communication is possible in some form.  I don’t believe that it is possible for intelligent life to exist in a form that prohibits communication.  If we cannot find a way to talk, or even understand that we are being spoken too, then we aren’t going to classify such life as intelligent.  In order to recognize intelligence, we must recognize some form of communication accessible to both species.  By that classification, ants are not intelligent, but whales and dolphins are.  At the worst, our communication attempts will be as if we are speaking with dolphins, or alternatively, we are the dolphins trying to understand the humans.  So given those conditions, what does it mean to us?  Theology.  The religious impact is enormous.  Maybe not to the Buddhists or Hindu, but the western and middle east monotheistic faiths will have trouble.  All of these faiths have been built around the concept that God has created the earth and all life.  Those texts establish that we are made in God’s image, and God’s message has been given to us.  If the aliens do not look like us, and do not have an analog to our own religions, with easily identifiable similarities or messages, then the human religions are suggesting that we are the chosen people of God.  The aliens are heathen, much as the native Americans in the time of Columbus.  It is then incumbent upon the faithful to convert the heathen, or in the notable case of Islam – kill them.    Those that look deeper into their faith will discover the inherent inconsistencies exposed by the discovery of alien life.  God makes no mention of other life, which means that either God has kept knowledge from us, or has offered incomplete gospel.  I don’t have a problem with that, but many people will.  The pragmatist will simply assume that the Word of God is not complete.  But those that consider the sacred texts as handed down by God rather than written by man will be puzzled over God’s exclusion of other life in the creation story, or the assertion that we have been given the Truth.    I honestly believe most faiths will adapt to the new reality and find interpretations that will patch any holes in the books, but in my view, to do so is to acknowledge that the structure of the faith is more of a man-made construct than any direct creation of God.  Should the aliens have a direct analog to any of the major faiths, with similar figures and stories, then I’m going to have to consider conversion!  But that’s another paper.  Cultural questions.  Humans are programmed with our own sense of self-importance.  We have always enjoyed a position of dominance on the earth, as a species.  Suddenly, in the larger scope, we aren’t going to be the center of the universe anymore.  It’s easy to see examples of how this could affect us.  All through history, inferior cultures and weak nations have constantly rebelled and struggled against the perception of oppression.  Humans don’t like to be on the bottom, and if the aliens are advanced to the extent that we feel inferior, we are going to resent them.  There isn’t much we can do about it, but the human psyche will be bruised by such a discovery.  We will quietly plan for the time when we will supplant them in terms of power, wealth and technology.  We will fear them, hate them, and plot against them, at least in private.  Publicly, we will do what most cultures have done in the past – smile, and learn.    Should we be the more advanced, the impact will be moderated.  We will look upon them as provincials, and ‘alien chic’ will be a new fashion, just as all things tribal have become fads in the past.  Perhaps the NYT will advocate an entitlement program to uplift their standard of living.    A question of resources.  Mike brought this one up, but I don’t think it will be a major issue.  At least for centuries, or even millennia.  While we have a natural drive to grab everything we can, even if we can’t use it immediately, the practical realities dictate that this isn’t possible.  Postulating our First Contact conditions, there will be no need to compete for resources.  And even if we had the technology to fight, that same technology would open up the resources of our own solar system.  Those resources will last us for thousands of years, even with a population one hundred times our current size.  And that’s just one system.    But there will still be questions of military confrontation at some point in the future.  It will be vital for us to continue developing weapons, and one of the most important projects in the days after First Contact will be discovering ways to kill our new neighbors.  That is the proper thing to do.  Plan for war, enjoy the peace.  There’s no other way.  Even if that war is thousands of years in the future, we must prepare for it.    As unlikely as it is that we will compete for resources, nothing is certain.  The presence of new neighbors creates a near certainty that the universe is littered with intelligent races.  We don’t become just one of two, we become one of millions.  Who knows where the threat lies, and when it will come.    While it is true that interstellar war is a ludicrous concept, even with our wildest imaginings of technology, there is always the unknown.  In the words of Rumsfeld, we don’t know what we don’t know, so we must prepare.    All intelligent species will inherently be hostile in nature.  You cannot evolve intelligence without the stimulus of hostility.  Herbivores do not need to be smart, as plants are generally docile prey.  We have our brains for one primary purpose – killing things.  We need to be smarter than our prey, smarter than the brute force of our environment, and smarter than the neighbors that wish to kill us in our Paleolithic past.  Aliens will have the same stimulus in their past, or they won’t evolve intelligence in the first place.  Therefore, it is essential that we acknowledge the reality of a hostile universe.  We must prepare for wars beyond our comprehension, because one day we must fight them.  There are plenty of other considerations worth exploring, but I have some meetings today and lack the time.  If we can stimulate some discussion, I’d like to keep going with it.

Why is it that every civilization with Islam as it's foundation is bathed in blood and suffering?  I heard the windbag Imus this morning wheezing about this bombing, going on and on about how it is a quagmire and Rumsfeld should be fired.  I wonder how Imus would feel about living in Jenin or Tel Aviv, where this happens at least once a month.  But Imus is a harsh critic of Ariel Sharon as well, so I guess he think's the Jews are to blame for thier own bombings.  I don't understand the Left.  Moral relativism and the inability to address the core issues will continue to perpetuate the slaughter.  How many people will die so that we can claim the moral high ground of 'respecting thier religion'?

       Aliens and the Meaning of Life   I linked a few days ago to a poll conducted for SciFi.com on the public's attitudes towards the possible discovery of alien life. Here it is again if you are interested:   urlLink The Roper Poll   In this poll, three quarters of those surveyed said they were prepared for the discovery of intelligent extra-terrestrial life. I don't believe this data is accurate. I would say that this number is as believable as the percentage of Americans who call themselves Christians. While these people may think they are ready for the consequences of alien intelligence, they most likely are not.  Here are some of the consequences: 1. Many relgions are no longer valid. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism all have thier creation stories wrong. They would either need to modify their "truths" or die. I would bet they would adapt, because the idea that they are utterly false illusions created to rule over men's minds is unacceptable to the common man. Also consider that an older race might have a firmer grasp of "truth" than we do. Who might convert to alien religions? 2. We suddenly have competition in the universe. If we are the only sentience, then we have all the time we need to expand and exploit resources as we need. With another group of beings out there, we had best hurry up our exploration and stake claims to what we want. Because it is logical for competition to occur over the scarce resources out there.  3. Who will represent us to them? What if they have nations? Are they united? Shoudl we lie to them? If we find them first, do we want to talk to them? Is some sort of united earth government needed to face the challenge of interaction in a suddenly more crowded universe? 4. The ultimate threat: They might decide to attack us. The sad truth is that there is room for only one race to lay claim to resources. I would favor annhilating the aliens if we posess the means. Just as the native Indians were wiped out for all intents so too must one race or the other become the master of another. Do not think I condone what happened to the Indians, but it was an inevitable result of the clash of civilizations. Because they were so incompatible, they had to battle for supremacy. The strong take from the weak. I hope the aliens are weaker than we are.  I suppose the idea that there are aliens is similar to a belief in God. Both are unseen, and seem to offer both hope and fear to those who believe. Hope in that it is the idea that there is a higher purpose in the case of God, or that life is plentiful in the case of aliens. Fear, as God holds power over everything, and aliens might bring a plethora of problems. I think we simply cannot plan or be ready for the discovery of aliens. AS long as they don't show up on our doorstep one day, we can at least expect hundreds of years of warning due to the speed of transmissions and of space travel.   Now I ask if we want to search for them? Is it worthwhile? Do we really want to find them or to try to isolate ourselves? We cannot assume they are out there, so it might well be a waste of resources to look. By the same token, any space exploration beyond what brings us immediate gain might be a waste. President Bush has proposed that we go back to the Moon and to Mars with manned missions. But for what purpose besides the need to explore? Why do we want to do these things? The cost is high, in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Is it worth it?  I say we must do it. I want us to accelerate our exploration and exploitation of space. There is no room to expand left on earth, so we must head into space. Space is free of competing nations, so we (the United States) can take what we want. But only if we are bold. I admit to an emotional need to see space exploration continue. I feel it embodies the very essence of being human. To dare what can't be done, to seek the next horizon and find the truths of the universe. If we turn inward and eschew expansion and discovery, we sign our own death warrants. Societies must always expand and dream big in order to survive. Though it is cliche, Space is the Final Frontier.  I cannot predict what benefits and challenges aggressive space exploration might bring us. But I want to face those challenges and reap those rewards right now. I want to see a man step out onto Mars in my lifetime. The troubles that the small-minded see all around us: hunger, poverty, ignorance, fundamentalism, health care - are all going to be with us no matter how much money we waste on them. But money directed towards exploration is money well-spent. It brings tangible results. It employs skilled workers, it glorifies achievement, and it gives form to the dream of the human spirit to discover the unknown.   I cannot over-emphasise the need for dreams and ambition. When someone ceases to dream he dies that very instant. When your reach ceases to exceed your grasp you have given up on life. Pushing back the frontier is a tremendous dream. I am inspired by the Mars rover missions. They are noble missions to seek the truths of life. This big dream can help up to rise above the small things that divide us. I would hope all of America could unite in a quest for expansion into space. But I fear we will always be distracted by the mewing of those who do not want to provide for themselves.  You cannot solve any problems with money! Giving a starving man a loaf only prolongs his condition! Either let him die of teach him to feed himself! Otherwise you perpetuate his weakness. Apply this logic to all of the social issues.   I wish we could have private enterprise lead the way into space, but national security and the sheer scale of such an undertaking necessitate federal guidance. Once it has been shown that there is profit to be made in space, private investment will expand to fulfill that potential. I would hope that NASA would enable free exploration, but maintain regulation. we can't let space fall to some competing interest, such as the EU or China. Space offers both promis and peril. As space becomes more utlilized, weaponry and defense will need to keep pace. I favor a unilateral program by the US to lead the way. A coalition of the willing, so to speak. I want the Stars and Stripes planted on Mars, not the UN flag or the hammer and sickle.  Bah, I'm tired.

       urlLink Amazon.com: Books: The White Plague    What I'm reading.  The talk of Dune reminded me I had this old book laying around, acquired from a used book store recently.  Herbert wrote quite a few books I've never read, and I'm probably going to look for them at the used store.    I'm about 100 pages into this one, and it's pretty good.  A little dated, but still compelling.  I like the way he has structured it.  He begins almost immediately with the plague being unleashed, and then alternates chapters to explain how we got to this point.  Instead of a bunch of setup, you get the action immediately, with the interludes of background made all the more interesting by the action counterpoints.    So far, I'm entertained.  That's all that matters, right?

       urlLink Mr. Bush?s Version   The NYT just gets it WRONG.  I think I’ve made it pretty clear that I don’t consider myself a Bush partisan.  Sure, I am a rabid conservative, but that doesn’t exactly describe Bush.  And like other conservatives, I’m willing to see our man lose if it results in a shift in GOP thinking further down the line.  But the current circumstances do not afford us the luxury of getting the Iraqi War wrong, especially for political gains.  Those that continue to try to sell Bush down the river are playing a dangerous game with the future of our country, and the world.  The NYT, like other ‘respected’ outlets of journalism are waiving their responsibility to get this right in exchange for furthering an ideology at the expense of our safety.  Here’s their latest smear job.  NYT - When Americans choose a president, their most profound consideration is whether a candidate can make the wisest possible decisions when it comes to war. In the case of George W. Bush, they will not only judge whether the invasion of Iraq was the right decision, but what our president has brought away from that experience. If there were misjudgments about the nature of Iraq's weapons programs or in the ways the administration presented that intelligence to the public, we need to know whether he recognizes them and has learned from them. Yesterday, in an interview with NBC's Tim Russert, after a week in which it became obvious to most Americans that the justifications for the war were based on flawed intelligence, Mr. Bush offered his reflections, and they were far from reassuring. The only clarity in the president's vision appears to be his own perfect sense of self-justification.  Me – ‘obvious to most Americans that the justifications for the war were based on flawed intelligence.’    It’s like arguing with a retarded child, but I have to continue to try since that retarded child is spreading gasoline around the family home.  Let’s review the justifications:  -16 UN resolutions, all violated. -Ejection of UN inspectors. -Refusal to provide proof of destruction of WMD. -Firing on Allied planes in No-Fly zones. -Saddam paying $20,000 to the family of any Palestinian who kills a Jew in a ‘martyrdom’ operation. -Seeking prohibited technologies. -Possessing missiles that exceed UN mandated range. -Blah blah blah.  Do I really need to go on?  Sure, WMD was a major part of this, since the UN resolutions had a lot to say about WMD.  Now, the same people who wanted to give the Inspectors years upon years to search for weapons while Saddam played a shell game, are now ready to conclude that there never were any weapons after eight months of searching.  And it is not hypocritical for the Bush people to want more time to search.  It was clear to all that the UN team did not have adequate freedom and access to accomplish their mission.  I certainly didn’t object to the length of time – my objection was with the obvious ineffectiveness of an inspection process where Saddam controlled access.    To conclude that the weapons were never there is ludicrous at this point.  I don’t fully understand why David Kay gave up this early, but there are probably reasons I’m unaware of at this point.  My primary point is that we can’t tell yet, and to assume that they don’t exist is highly dangerous.  We have a noted criminal, holding us all hostage to his insanity.  This criminal has executed millions, and has demonstrated a willingness to slaughter any number of people.  In addition, he is doing all that he can to convince us that he has prohibited weapons systems, broadcasting threats, toying with our verification process, and refusing to demonstrate the truth.  And now we crucify the man who took this beast down?    It’s like a police officer cornering a known murderer, and then shooting him when the murderer pretends to draw a gun.  Can anyone blame the cop if the gun isn’t really there?  Are we not better off?  Bah, back to the Times.  NYT - Right now, the questions average Americans are asking about Iraq seem much clearer than the ones Mr. Bush is willing to confront. People want to know why American intelligence was so wrong about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Mr. Bush didn't have a consistent position on this pivotal issue. At some points during his Oval Office interview, he seemed to be admitting that he had been completely wrong when he told the public just before the war started that the intelligence left "no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised." At other moments he suggested the weapons might still be hidden somewhere, or that they may have been transported to another country. At times he depicted himself as having been misled by intelligence reports. But he insisted that George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, was doing a good job and deserved to keep his job.   Me – Yes, Americans DO want to know what happened to our intelligence.  If it turns out that there aren’t weapons, then we DO need a full inquiry to find out what went wrong, and how to improve our intel in the future.  This is a separate issue from the justification of the Iraq war.  It is a preventative measure against future wars.  We need to know where the intel broke down, and we need to fix it.  Any sensible American wants those answers.  Our credibility is important, and if we go to the UN tomorrow and say Syria has a nuke and is trying to smuggle it into Tel Aviv, we need that credibility to stand up.  As it is now, thanks to the echo chamber of the media, our credibility is being used up for the wrong reasons.  Our actions in Iraq were just, no matter what.  The burden of proof was on Saddam, and he failed to deliver.  If he didn’t have the weapons, he shouldn’t have played this game.  End of story.    NYT - Average Americans are also asking themselves whether invading Iraq would have seemed like the right decision if we knew then what we know now. Mr. Bush doesn't seem willing to even take on this critical question. He repeatedly referred to Saddam Hussein as a dangerous madman, without defining the threat that even a madman, without any weapons of mass destruction, posed to the United States. At one point, his reasoning seemed to be that even if the dictator did not have the feared weapons, he could have started manufacturing them on a moment's notice. To bolster his position, he cited David Kay, the American weapons inspector, as reporting that "Saddam Hussein was dangerous with the ability to make weapons." In fact, Mr. Kay said that Iraq's weapons program seemed to have ground to a halt under the pressure of the United Nations inspections and sanctions that Mr. Bush and his staff disdained last year. Mr. Kay said Saddam Hussein retained only the basic ability to restart weapons programs if that pressure were removed.  Me – The NYT drops Kay’s line that ‘in many ways, Iraq was even MORE dangerous than we had thought.’  If the Saddam regime was starting to crumble, then Iraq would indeed by more dangerous as nefarious types moved into the vacuum.  Saddam had prohibited programs.  Kay has testified that Saddam had accumulated the knowledge and resources to construct crude weapons systems, even if he hadn’t done so yet. He had a ready made workshop, needing only a few key ingredients to complete the job.  Are we supposed to concede that this is an acceptable condition, provided we continue with sanctions?  Have you seen the list of people receiving payouts from Saddam in exchange for a continued erosion of sanctions?    I simply cannot understand the retarded child.  If someone sets up a meth lab in a preschool, yet does not actually make meth, is that okay?  The Times fails to understand the new world we live in after September 11th, and for the life of me, I cannot understand this failure.  How can you witness such evil in your own town, yet continue to be blind to the evil intents of others?  How can you construct an argument that suggests inaction is the preferred path?  NYT - At other times, the president seemed to argue that the invasion was necessary simply to demonstrate that Americans did not back down from a fight. "In my judgment, when the United States says there will be serious consequences, and if there isn't serious consequences, it creates adverse consequences," he said. Although Mr. Bush tried to portray himself as a man who exhausted every peaceful solution, the "serious consequences" were threatened in a United Nations resolution in late 2002 that Mr. Bush was forced to seek to mollify nervous allies after the decision to have a war was essentially made.  Me – Well, it is already obvious that the NYT neither seeks nor accepts ANY consequence of violation of UN sanction.  And these are the people who hold the UN to the highest regard.  16 resolutions.  How many times must you be assaulted before you react?  Do Americans want to emulate the NYT in their capacity for patience?    NYT - Mr. Bush's explanation of how he reconciled the current activities in Iraq with his 2000 campaign rejection of "nation building" was simply silly. (American troops are building a nation in Iraq, he said, but they are also "fighting a war so that they can build a nation.") And it's very hard to take seriously Mr. Bush's contention that he was not surprised by the intensity of the resistance in Iraq.   Me – Yes, Bush disparaged ‘nation building’ in 2000.  He thought it was an inappropriate use of the military when there was little threat to us.  But note the date.  2000 is earlier than 2001.  The retarded child has no sense that the world changed at some point in 2001, and those that hold beliefs that no longer apply to the current situation have a particular label – fools.  Bush changed his view in response to this new reality.  Something well beyond the capacity of the NYT editorial board.  NYT - The president was doing far more yesterday than rolling out the administration's spin for the next campaign. He was demonstrating how he is likely to think if confronted with a similar crisis in the future. The fuzziness and inconsistency of his comments suggest he is still relying on his own moral absolutism, that in a dangerous world the critical thing is to act decisively, and worry about connecting the dots later. Mr. Bush said repeatedly that he went to the United Nations seeking a diplomatic alternative to war. In fact, the United States rejected all diplomatic alternatives at the time, severely damaging relations with some of its most important and loyal allies. "I believe it is essential that when we see a threat, we deal with those threats before they become imminent," he said. "It's too late if they become imminent."  Me – Oh yes, we need to have much more ‘moral relativism’.  Yes, that is the way!  Relativism brought us the Palestinian terror bombings, the slaughter in Rwanda, the killing in Serbia, and the continued festering of Islam.  The unwillingness to take a stand and label something as ‘wrong’ is precisely what delivered us to this dangerous time in history.    ‘The fuzziness and inconsistency of his comments suggest he is still relying on his own moral absolutism, that in a dangerous world the critical thing is to act decisively, and worry about connecting the dots later.’  If we deconstruct this statement, the NYT is suggesting that the prudent thing in a dangerous world is to act indecisively, and make sure you have all of your details in order so that you will be on the correct side of academics, even if it does result in the smoking remains of New York or London?  The Times is either blind with partisan rage, unspeakably stupid, or inhumanly devoid of common sense.  NYT - Another question average Americans will be asking themselves this election year is whether the Bush administration, which wanted to invade Iraq even before Sept. 11, manipulated the intelligence reports to frighten Congress and the public into supporting the idea. The president's claim yesterday that Congress had access to exactly the same intelligence he had was inaccurate, and his comments about the new commission he has appointed to look into intelligence gathering made it clear that he has no intention of having his administration's actions included in the probe.  Me- The president’s claim was inaccurate?  It would be nice to see some evidence that this is the case.  I’m sure the Times will explain that phrase in the next sentence, or at least provide some substantiation.  Oh wait, it seems they don’t.  Need I refer you again to the page listing the cries of all those Democratic senators who begged for action against Saddam, based upon intelligence regarding weapons?  As for the president’s ‘refusal’ to testify, the Times display an ignorance of the Constitution.  The president doesn’t answer to the Congress.  He is not required to testify in such proceedings, nor should he.  There is a mechanism by which the people can express disapproval should they feel the president is criminally unaccountable – it’s called impeachment.  Should the Congress believe that the president has manufactured evidence, or pressured analysts to modify their data, they should begin impeachment immediately.  If I were Bush, I would demand an impeachment hearing immediately.  (And before you can begin chanting ‘double standard’ in the Clinton case, let me address it.  Clinton testified in a trial brought by a private citizen regarding an action committed before he was president.  Being president does not make you immune to the consequence of crime.  He was not answering to Congress.  The impeachment process began the moment Clinton violated the sworn oath by committing provable perjury.  It’s a completely different situation.)  NYT - Some of Mr. Bush's comments yesterday raise questions even more disturbing than the idea that senior administration members might have misled the nation about the intelligence on Iraq. The nation obviously needs a leader who is always alert to the threat of terrorism from abroad. But it cannot afford to have one who responds to the trauma of 9/11 by overreacting to the possibility of danger. In the coming campaign, Mr. Bush, who described himself as a "war president," is going to have to show the country that he is capable of distinguishing real threats from false alarms, and has the courage to tell the nation the truth about something as profound as war. Nothing in the interview offered much hope in that direction.  Me- Here it is, in print.  The NYT suggests that protecting our interests abroad, and striking at the heart of terror, is an ‘overreaction’ to the events of September 11th.  I am amazed, disgusted and overwhelmed.  The electoral map is just a surface reflection of vast differences between the ideological poles.    The Times isn’t serious about protecting the nation.  Those that join in tearing down our resolve are blind with their hatred, and seem perfectly willing to sacrifice our security for a short term gain in the political landscape.  I haven’t been willing to go this far, but I am now prepared to join Ann Coulter in throwing around the word ‘treason’ as an appropriate description for those that blur the truth to serve their own ends.  We need an honest inquiry on intelligence, but to warp it into a freak show where we crucify a president in the name of power is unspeakable treason.    If this succeeds in bringing down the president, then we deserve the future we inherit.

      I had mentioned the article in Time where they blasted Big Drug as being the source of all Evil.  Well, this popped up in my mail box this morning.  Pfizer has taken the time to refute the fallacies in the article.  Pretty cool to work for a company that provides ready made Blog posts.  Hark, Big Drug speaks!  Inaccuracies in Time Magazine Article Addressed – February 6, 2004  The February 2, 2004, issue of Time Magazine featured a cover story titled: “Why We Pay So Much for Drugs” reported by Donald L. Bartlett and James B. Steele. The story explores concerns about pricing and access to medicines in America. The public health and policy issues related to costs and delivery of medicines are both complex and enormously important. Unfortunately, Time chose to tell this story from one point of view. The result is a story riddled with inaccuracies and unsupported claims, several of which Pfizer would like to draw to the attention of Time’s editors and readers here:   TIME:            […] On average, name-brand prescription drugs in Canada cost an estimated 40% less than they do in the U.S. On a trip last November, Clark did even better than that, buying a six-month supply of medications for a little more than $1,000, a cache that she estimates would have cost about $3,000 in Maine for the same drugs.    One of them is Lipitor, the expensive, heavily marketed cholesterol-lowering drug developed by Pfizer. "Lipitor is my biggest savings," Clark says. "For a six-month supply, it's $1,900 in the U.S. I paid $500 [in Canada].” […]   FACT: A spot check of retail prices for Lipitor at pharmacies near Kennebunk, where Mrs. Clark lives, shows that a same six month supply of Lipitor can be purchased for $386-$588 (depending on dosage) without breaking the law.   TIME:            […] Nor does it help the millions of working people not eligible for Medicare coverage. As health-care spending keeps rising, (9.3% in 2002, according to the trade journal Health Affairs, the largest increase in 11 years) and employers tighten their coverage to cut costs, consumers have grown more resentful of what they are paying at the drugstore. While prescriptions represented only 10.5% of total health-care costs in the U.S. in 2002, they amounted to 23% of out-of-pocket costs for the consumer. Americans spent $162.4 billion on prescription drugs in 2002, up from less than $100 billion a decade ago. […]   FACT: Although spending increased 9.3 percent in 2002, the same Health Affairs article cited by Time found that prescription drug spending growth slowed the most. Time failed to note that the cost to consumers, however, is related to changes in coverage. Health Affairs found that while private spending on prescription drugs grew at the same rate in 2001 and 2002, out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs accelerated by 3.5 percentage points in 2002. At the same time, private health insurance spending slowed by 2.1 percentage points. Still, prescription drug spending still represents about 10 percent of all health care spending, just as it did in 1960.   TIME:            […] Actually, pharmaceutical roulette is played every day in the U.S.—with FDA-approved drugs. […] by comparison, the risk from defective, counterfeit or mislabeled drugs from Canada is presumed but unproved by any evidence. […]   FACT: Time ignores a recent series of spot examinations by the FDA of medicines imported by mail into the U.S. The inspections found that drugs entering the United States are often unapproved or counterfeit medicines. According to the FDA, “Of the 1,153 imported drug products examined, the overwhelming majority, 1,019 (88 percent), were [in violation of law] because they contained unapproved drugs. Many of these imported drugs could pose clear safety problems.” (Source: FDA, “FDA/U.S. Customs Import Blitz Exams Reveal Hundreds of Potentially Dangerous Imported Drug Shipments,” press release: September 29, 2003.)   The authors illogically claim that because there are adverse events already in the U.S., importing drugs from Canada poses no additional risk. In reality, even with the FDA-certified current supply in the U.S., only with careful supervision can the right medicine be given to patients safely. Compounding the difficulty with an additional layer of risk is dangerous.   TIME:            […] While the FDA and the drug industry have talked at length about the threat posed by drugs brought in from Canada, what they neglect to mention is this: prescription drugs bought by Americans increasingly are produced in foreign countries with minimal FDA oversight and then shipped to the U.S. […]   FACT: The writers suggest an inconsistency in our position on importing medicines from our own overseas facilities and our position on imports by third-parties from Canada. These two issues are separate and distinct and Time—either by design or oversight—has neglected to address industry and FDA’s real safety concern, which is that Canadian drug imports fall outside the heavily regulated drug supply chains that exist within both countries. FDA and Health Canada have warned repeatedly that neither agency can guarantee the safety of drugs that move between the two countries. In other words, this illegal supply chain is unregulated. As FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan recently said, “It’s when you go outside of the comprehensive safety systems created within the U.S. and Canadian regulatory umbrellas that there are serious safety gaps.” (Speech before Drug Information Association, Ottawa, Canada, November 18, 2003.) A report by Ward Health Strategies found that this gap has opened a market for “drugs making their way from Canadian suppliers to American consumers [that] are of neither Canadian nor American origin.” (“Price Controls, Importation and the Safety of the Drug Supply Chain,” Ward Health Strategies, October 2003)   TIME:            […]For its part, the FDA maintains that all these facilities are perfectly safe, that they have undergone inspections and that their manufacturing processes have been certified as meeting the agency's standards. But while the FDA does indeed inspect plants before opening, after that the oversight trails off. "The FDA has limited resources," an industry consultant told TIME. "The foreign drug-inspection program I don't think is very strong." […]   FACT: Every Pfizer product sold in the United States—regardless of where it is made—adheres to strict FDA standards for manufacturing, packaging, labeling and shipping. Product shipments to the United States from Pfizer’s foreign manufacturing locations are authenticated by FDA officers who work with U.S. Customs. The FDA polices our supply chain by conducting random and unannounced inspections of our manufacturing locations.    TIME:            […] While the industry is quick to claim how much it must spend to come up with new drugs, it is slow to acknowledge the contributions of the Federal Government and American taxpayers. Universities, foundations, researchers and congressional committees have concluded for years that many major drugs owe their origins to research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Cancer Institute and other public agencies. […]   FACT: In 2003, the entire NIH budget was $27 billion. This covered all kinds of medical research, an extremely small proportion of which may have some role in future drug development and an even smaller proportion of which might have some commercial value. For the same period, U.S. pharmaceutical firms invested more than $33 billion in R&D alone.   TIME:            […] A report by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress in 2000, then headed by Republican Senator Connie Mack of Florida, summed it up: “The Federal Government, mainly through the NIH, funds about 36% of all U.S. medical research ... Of the 21 most important drugs introduced between 1965 and 1992, 15 were developed using knowledge and techniques from federally funded research.” […]   FACT: This only tells half the story. After the Joint Economic Committee report quoted here was released three years ago, the NIH issued a response (July, 2001) stating that “of the 47 drugs major drugs on the market in 1999, only 4 were developed in part with technologies from NIH funding.” The original study cited in the JEC report stated that for 15 out of 21 “important” drugs, a key enabling discovery was made by publicly funded scientists. However, the same report found that 78 percent of those same drugs were first synthesized by industry scientists.   TIME:            […] “...mostly because of high prices guaranteed by Congress, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, year in and year out, ranks as the country's richest.” […]   FACT: It is simply untrue that Congress guarantees high prices for pharmaceuticals in the United States. Unlike many developed countries where governments directly or indirectly pervasively fix prices for pharmaceuticals, the United States has generally adhered to the principle that a market economy, and competition in that marketplace, ultimately achieves the best balance of funded innovation, patient access, return to the capital markets, and the other complex variables that govern a high-risk and dynamic industry.   Nevertheless, federal and state governments—and private payers—have undertaken a number of steps to manage the price and utilization of pharmaceuticals. For example, in Medicaid, pharmaceutical companies are required to provide significant rebates and are subject to other forms of price constraint as a condition of participating.

      I had a sort of revelation last night. An event that I may date my life from. Like being born-again, last night my conception of reality shifted. I ceased being who I was, and I am now someone different.  I have been unhappy for months now. Going to classes, doing homework, and the daily chores of life have lost any meaning or enjoyment they once had. It was as if I was an animated doll going about some function. I was not alive but merely living. Last night I realized exactly why. I am not doing what I am meant to do. I do not enjoy my life as it is. I am taking courses to prepare me for a life as a Mechanical Engineer. Now I realize that I do not want to do that. I want something else.   This "something else" is currently unknown to me. I do have a suspicion it relates to my passion for morality, society, politics, and the deeper meaning behind existence. I may seek education in journalism, or writing. Having my own opinion column could be my true calling. I am not sure right now, but I do know now that being an engineer is probably not for me. The endless drudgery of banging out designs or product improvements fills me with dread. I couldn't do that every day. This revelation hit me like a bolt of lightning. I just sat in class, and I suddenly Knew I didn't belong. It wasn't that I didn't understand, but that I was masquerading as a student of a profession I had no interest in. I was lying to myself and to everyone else by being there.  So now I am beginning the process of changing my life. Next week I will talk with a counselor at my school and take some tests designed to pinpoint interests and aptitudes. I am also going to make appointments for discussions with some people in different colleges about a change of major. As I go to a engineering school, I will probably have to transfer to another college. I will update this blog with the news from these efforts.   Thank you Todd for helping me to be honest with myself. I realize it is a rare and precious thing to learn early that what you are doing is not what you should be doing. I hope I can use that knowledge to find my true calling, so that I can enjoy my life from here on out. The hard part is actually breaking away from my current path and heading out into unknown territory. I have a mental block on the pursuit of "soft" disciplines like writing and art. Those are for lesser men. But now I realize in my heart that I want to create something unique, and to bring my own viewpoint and ideas into the world. I can't do that as an engineer. I would be just a cog in the machine. Even if I am nothing more than some insignificant reporter covering Groundhog Day or somesuch I will at least be pursuing what it is I want to do. I want to reach people, to change them. Maybe I am some sort of crusader. Like an idealistic leftist, but without the crooked world-view.  I always thought it was foolish and stupid to try to change the world. That's why most people become journalists. They think they can make the world a better place. Most are crazy leftists infused with socialism. They want to end inequalities and tear down the establishment. I have no such illusions. But it is strange to think I may seek this path.  At this moment I am continuing my classes as they are. I am merely exploring my options for change. It may be that I turn back to what I am doing now. But I doubt that. I find no joy in it now, and I realize I never have. If anyone wants to share their thoughts on the issues of doing what you love, finding your true calling, or can offer any advice to me feel free to post here, comment, or email me.

       urlLink Op-Ed Columnist: Purity of the Powells   DOWD is up with her latest column.  In her smug, sanctimonious tone, she explains why Michael Powell, Chair of the FCC should not do a thing about Janet Jackson, but Colin Powell, the father, should revolt against his own president and strive to topple the Iraq policy.  "Rummy stuck to his Orwellian guns, telling Congress yesterday that just because we don't find the weapons doesn't mean they're not there."  I guess when Eric Rudolph eluded law enforcement for what, four years in the Carolinas, he didn't really exist at all since he could not be found.  Is she really this stupid?  "The younger Powell failed to appreciate the consequences of not curbing big media companies gobbling up rivals. Colin Powell failed to appreciate the consequences of not curbing Dick Cheney, Rummy and Wolfie as they gobbled up foreign policy."  The costume malfunction is a result of media merger?  And I'd like to see a SecState try to curb the VP.    It's the same old thing with her.  Setting the standard so high that we will never be able to defend ourselves until we've already been hit hard.  My only hope is that she can directly experience the consequence of the course of action she advocates.

I haven't decided exactly what I'm going to do, but one option was graduate school here at Western Michigan.  I don't know if that is the way to go, but I began researching it recently.  Well, I found out last night that they have a Masters of Fine Arts for Creative Writing, which is exactly what I want to do.  It looks like a good program, meeting my needs.  Unfortunately, they accept applications only once per year, and the due date was 2/1/04.  D'OH!  But what is even more amusing is the 'gatekeeper' for the Grad program.  She has great power in deciding who gets in and who does not.  To borrow a phrase from Mike, she is 'Sauron' here at WMU.  I must appease her.  Well, in reading her bio, I discover that she is a PhD in feminist and ethnic literature.    Hah!  I'm going to sit across from her and tell her that this white boy wants to occupy a slot in her program to write science fiction and fantasy?    So I think my chances are effectively doomed.

You might be seeing polls that show Kerry beating Bush, but those are laughable at this point.  The electorate doesn't even know Kerry yet, and they are responding to two months of favorable press, plus the natural desire to associate themselves with a 'winner'.  When Bush actually stirs himself to campaign, his staff will present Kerry on a platter.  I don't think it's going to be close on election day, but the media will pump up Kerry's chances until the last moment.  That brings me back to Bush and my anger.  I've decided I will not vote for him unless the election really is close.  I can't bring myself to reward the spending.  I want him to win, since it is vital that we be resolute in the face of terror, but I just can't bring myself to give him my vote.  I will vote libertarian, even though that party will never have a chance in hell of ever winning a national office (since they nominate crackpots).  Much like Al Sharpton gathering delegates to build a small base of power, I'll throw my lot in with the Libertarians in an effort to try to attract the attention of the true conservatives in the GOP.

       urlLink Europe Plans Human Missions to Moon and Mars   The EUniks are now in on the act.  Several ways to interpret this.  Either they are a little daft and think they can actually get it done, despite not having any significant manned flight experience, and despite their internal politics that should tear the EU apart in a generation, and despite the squabble over who will get what contracts and what nationality will supply the astronauts.  Or, they think we are somewhat serious and they really want to be invited to the mission.  If they put up some money and begin work, I think they believe we will ask them in.  I personally don't want them involved.  The Russians have a legitimate reason because of thier expertiese and experience, but the EU?  Why drag them along?

Oh yes...  they have to do something to instill fear, terror, and awe...Must be something BIG going on since they're diverting attention again..    how come we managed to go over 200 years and it's only been since Bush took office that we've had all these kinds of 'attacks'. I know there there have been events beforehand, but it really seems to have picked up speed since the sheep put the chimp in charge.  It'd be interesting to know if many people have wondered if the same administration which lays waste to thousands of people OUTSIDE the country wouldn't also be happy to kill off people of different political outlooks WITHIN the country, too.  Politically motivated neocon plant.  They are showing that they can strike congress at anytime.  The PNAC and the NEOCONS is the terrorist group we should be fearing.

       A Stern Warning on Freedom vs. Security   I posted this below in the Comments section, but I feel it is worthy of its own post.  I am not ashamed to admit that I worship the ground George Will walks on. He has succinctly put the fundamental trurh of conservatism in one sentance:  Conservatives say inequalities of outcomes are manifestations of freedom and prerequisites for progress.   Embrace the idea that some will not have the happy outcomes of others, no matter what money is thrown at them. Donald Trump is rich because of his own actions. A crack ho is destitute and doomed because of her own actions. While I do not aspire to greatness, I do know what it is and where it comes from. No one can be handed success. It must be earned, and the pryrimidal structure of achievement in society compels those who would climb it to strive against one another.   What Leftists seek is to crush the spirit of competition in the name of fairness and security. This is otherwise known as Communism. If there is no apex, no pyrimid to ascend, why would we ever strive to be more than we are? Why improve yourself and take risk when there is no payoff? Ronald Reagan called the USA a shining city on a hill. We still are, but for how long? Note the language used: on a hill. That means we are above the rest; elevated above the others.   I hope we do not forsake that which made us great. Things like freedom and liberty. An ethos that rewards and idolizes those who succeed. Americans love a winner, but it seems we now want everyone to think they are winners. This has the paradoxial effect of manking the true winner a loser like the rest.  If we hand over the freedom to succeed or fail in exchange for the straight-jacket of security, then we truly have forsaken what this country was founded to be. George Bush is offering it to us. So are his Democratic rivals. The nanny-state cometh, and I fear it is inescapable. I'm sorry I can't offer any hope for the world, as it seems we no longer care about hope, only our base needs.   This is why Space is so important. Though we fall into the darkness the rest of the world embraces, we can at least pave the way for an escape for the future generations. Space, and other worlds may ultimately be that avenue of freedom. One day there will be another generation with the greatness of our Founding Fathers. They will need some place to go to escape the oppression of the Old World. But now that oppresssion seeks to deny them that in advance. We would sell the future for some breat in the present. The Children and the Old need our money more!   No, they don't. The old have their own money, earned through a lifetime of labor. If they do not, they failed. Plain and simple. The fact that old age comes to us all is well-known. So the duty to prepare is also incumbent on everyone. It is not incumbent on the young to labor in support of the old. Children have thier parents. They do not need the State to pay for their education! Why should those who do not have offspring pay for priveledges for those who do? Again, that is called slavery. These two groups do not need the State to take care of them. They can take care of themselves, or have their relatives do the job for them.  In closing, I must reiterate my reverence and awe for what the Founders did. They threw off the shackles of prior thought, and oppression to found what is the most perfect nation that has ever existed. ut we are not perfect, so the state cannot endure. It has been steadily eroded and mutated almost beyond recognition. The only way to turn back lies not in elections or legislation, but in our hearts. Know yourself, and know that you are your own master. You have no right to compel labor or sacrifice of others! Own your own actions and ask the same of others! Do not trade freedom for the dubious offer of security. That way lies slavery.

       urlLink sacbee.com -- George Will -- George F. Will: DeMint's eager agenda :   A must-read from George Will.  "America is in, he says, 'an eleventh-hour crisis' of democracy because it recently reached a point where a majority are 'dependent on the federal government for their health care, education, income or retirement.' Tax reforms, from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush, have removed many Americans from the income tax rolls: 'Today, the majority of Americans can vote themselves more generous government benefits at little or no cost to themselves.' DeMint asks: 'How can any free nation survive when a majority of its citizens, now dependent on government services, no longer have the incentive to restrain the growth of government?' DeMint's fear, that dependency produces 'learned helplessness,' echoes Tocqueville's warning about government keeping people 'fixed irrevocably in childhood,' rendering 'the employment of free will less useful and more rare.' It is, Tocqueville said, 'difficult to conceive how men who have entirely renounced the habit of directing themselves could succeed at choosing well those who will lead them.'"  Another favorite line -   Why has the cost of laser eye surgery fallen 22 percent in four years? For the same reason the cost of cosmetic surgery has been rising more slowly than the inflation rate. These elective procedures are generally paid for by individuals from their own resources.

       urlLink Israel News : Jerusalem Post Internet Edition   Religion of peace again, recruiting a 15 year old boy.    "In the mosque, Tamer and other worshippers were expressing their anger over the assassination, and a 19-year-old Islamic Jihad terrorist asked the youth whether he wanted to meet a religious leader, or sheik, from the group, Raed Khweirah said.  Tamer was taken to a private home in Nablus' old city, a militant stronghold, where he met the sheik, who introduced himself only as Ibrahim, Khweirah said. In the first session, the sheik spoke to Tamer about the need to avenge Yassin.  In a second encounter last week, the sheik tried to persuade Tamer to carry out a suicide bombing, according to the boy's older brother. The sheik locked Tamer in a dark room for a while, then took him to a well-lit room, explaining to the boy that this illustrated the difference between eternal damnation and paradise.  Paradise and 72 virgins are assured for any bomber, the sheik told Tamer, who is from a well-to-do family and according to his family had a sheltered upbringing.  When the youngster expressed concern that his family's house would be demolished - standard Israeli reprisal - the sheik said Islamic Jihad would pay 50,000 Jordanian dinar (US$ 35,000) to make up for the loss.  When the boy protested that he'd like to be around for the weddings of his two sisters in the summer, the sheik told him that 'you will go to paradise and meet them there,' according to the older brother.

       urlLink OpinionJournal - Featured Article   This is an informative and short primer on why gas prices are high, and why we should take the time to understand the issue rather than crying to Daddy Bush to make the pain stop.  The most salient point is the final one - anytime you do something artificial to lower the cost of a good, the supply of that good decreases, creating shortages.  The Nixon price controls created the gas lines.  Anytime you take a fixed supply and discount it, demand increases.  With no economic incentive to provide more, you just get shortages.  Sadly, 99% of Americans don't understand, or don't care to even try to understand, the essence of the system that drives our own economy.  They just want cheap stuff now, regardless of the realities of economics.  You want cheap gas?  Reduce arbitrary environmentally sanctioned blends.  Allow drilling.  Build new refineries.  This is a supply issue, so address the supply!!  We aren't going to 'ration' ourselves to prosperity.    And as for the eventual Hyrdogen economy, bring it on!  I'd be just as happy as the next guy to never need another drop of hydrocarbon, but that day isn't here yet.  So let's get what we need and keep things moving along.

       urlLink Box Office Mojo > Box Office By Movie   Well, I've viewed the Passion, and I'm having difficulty figuring out what I think about it.    Sunday morning, Mark and I decided to go see a movie, and after some last minute scrambling which I'll leave to him to explain, we ended up sitting the theater for the Passion.  Somehow, my Pretzel Bites seemed inappropriate, but that didn't stop me from consuming them.  I muttered to Mark a question about what trailers are appropriate for this film?  Martin Lawrence?  It seems the studio might have had the same issues, as the film opened with NO trailers, NO ads, NONE of the usual theater stuff.  It just started.  So what did I think?  This is an odd movie.  Your perspective or expectations is the sole determinant of what you get from this movie.  It is a large mirror, held up for you to look at yourself and find what you want.    I came into it as a non-believer, but filled with respect for the importance of the story and what this means to so many.  I don't think you can be considered a genuine thinker if you hold the Christ story with anything other than respect.  Whether or not Jesus was what is claimed, his teachings converted the dominate empire in the day, and established a foundation for 2,000 years of a culture that lifted us all out of darkness.  Without Christ, the Western World would simply not exist in a recognizable way.  So I respect the power of this story, while the divinity of it is still an open issue for me.  Given that, the movie reinforced my respect for the icons and ideas in the Passion.  It is extraordinarily well-made.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Gibson has inserted classical iconographic images that will add to the historical collection of Christ images.  Caviezel was genuine and understated in his performance, given what he had to work with.  His portrayal showed a very human Jesus, making him accessible as a man.    The violence in the film is appropriately brutal.  I still don't understand those that object to it, since it is the very POINT of the entire Passion.  His suffering is what redeems us, so we should see exactly what that entailed.  During the scourging, I remembered someone saying that the brutal torturing of Jesus in the film is akin to voyeurism - that we are watching the indignities and privation of a man, and perhaps that suffering should be a private matter.  The very point of this pain is in the claim that we are all to blame, since it is done on our behalf and for our benefit.  This pain is the very essence of public domain.  It is a difficult film to review.  My respect was confirmed and enhanced.  My emotion was stirred.  I believe all Western's carry a latent Christian within, and that latency was stirred.  From a 'movie critic' perspective, there are minor points that can be argued.  There are technical shots, story telling constructs and symbolisms that can be debated, and that is a useful exercise from that particular perspective.  But to engage in criticism based on those elements alone is unfair when an ultimate judgment is rendered on the movie.  The claims of anti-Semitism are unfounded, unless you carry in your own existing anti-Semitism, or if you carry in a fear that other's are anti-Semitic.  The Jews are portrayed as any other entranced establishment in human history, facing something that is threatening the status quo.  The particular 'bloodlust' of the Jewish rabbinate is not an indication of evil - it illustrates them as a product of their time and the cultural norms of the era.  I honestly didn't see anyone in this film portrayed as 'evil', other than the casual drunken brutality of the Roman garrison troops, which is pandemic to humanity through history.  Judas seemed to have played the part given to him, as did Pilate, and even the rabbinate.  Pilate was particularly portrayed as a man simple doing what men do when faced with tough choices.  He went out of his way to attempt to save Jesus, but not because of love, but because of expediency.  Anything to quell passions and to prevent a riot.  In the end, the crucifixion of Jesus was a problem of administration rather than an ethical concern.  I think that might have been Gibson's point in the film.  Everyone involved simply did what people do everyday throughout history.  And that is exactly what led to the crucifixion.  Only be acting 'inhuman', by stepping outside of our petty programming, can we prevent the need for the Sacrifice.    If you show up at the theater with contempt for the story, you'll have a cynical, pointless experience.  If you show up as a believer, then this will be an Experience for you.  But there is something else that bothers me.  I believe that those with the strongest of faiths, who truly embrace the ideas of Christ, may not have the 'Experience' in viewing this film.  To those who have true, rock solid faith, the brutality and pain of the sacrifice is sufficiently real to them.  They already understand what it all means, and I don't think they will get the gut-level reaction.  The vast multitudes of people perhaps cling too tightly to their faith out of fear it may slip through their grasp.  These are the people who may be pummeled and shocked by what they see.  These are the people who only have the painted images of the halo-endowed Christ: tall, thin, attractive and smiling.  They may not have a true understanding of the crucifixion outside of the static carving of the wooden Jesus on the wooden Cross.    And again, that might be Gibson's point as well.  Those most shocked and impacted may not have a complete understanding of what they've embraced.  Like someone who joins the military and is then shocked to find themselves in a war.  To BE a Christian requires more than lip service.  It requires more than platitudes.  It requires living the idea, and understanding the price of your belief.  It means understanding the price that was paid to purchase the covenant with God.  And I believe most do NOT truly understand it on a visceral level.  I recommend seeing the film, but take some time and figure out who and what you are before you go in.  Understand what you are looking for, because you'll find it, no matter what it is.

       urlLink A Misleading Fetal Violence Law   NYT - "Although it exempts legally performed abortions, it also defines a "child in utero" as "a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb." This equivalence between a fetus in its earliest stages and a child sets a dangerous legal precedent."  A dangerous legal precedent?  To say that a fetus is a human?  I really think that should be the default position.  If the NYT and the abortion rights people want to be honest about things, THEY should advocate legislation that stipulates the moment a fetus becomes human, defining it as 'non-human' during the interval when abortion should be permissible.  It would illustrate honesty about what they hope to achieve.  And for the record, I oppose abortion as it is now defined in Roe V. Wade.  I don't believe it is a Constitutional issue.  My solution is to overturn Roe and devolve the issue to each state.  Should a state wish to have abortion into the ninth month, then that's up to the residents of that state.  I would simply move away.

The French and Russian administers of the Oil for Food program funneled billions of dollars to Saddam as kickbacks, in exchange for shipping shoddy goods or even phantom shipments.  So the French and Russians make money by NOT supplying food and medicine, and Saddam gets his money to build the military.  Now the French UN ambassador is stonewalling the Security Council investigation.  It also turns out that the son of the SecGen of the UN, Kofi Anan, worked for the auditing firm awarded the contract to assure the program was legitimate.  It's all quite a mess, and it continues to explain the 'principled' objections of the French and the Russians prior to the war.

      My weekend plans - if anyone cares.  We're heading out to Toledo after I get off work.  After being back in the region for a year, we FINALLY got some time scheduled at Steve's to do something 'fun'.  With the goal of 'fun' in mind, we inexplicably settled on playing Magic for the evening on Saturday.  I'll try to report back on how the activity interfaces with the goal....  I haven't played in probably two years, so we'll see how the old stuff holds up against the new stuff.  There's a chance I'll end up on three roller hockey leagues starting next month.  The closest rink to my house (actually three rinks in one building) has an adult and a coed league, and I plan on doing both, mostly to get extra play time in the coed league for exercise.  I drove by a second rink yesterday, about five miles from the house.  I put a request for information in, and will know more soon.  I also started walking to work this week (1.4 miles each way).  Didn't do it today though because it was raining heavily this morning.  It feels good to get active again, after essentially eight years of sitting either at a desk or behind the wheel of my car for most of the day.  The basement is looking good.  My dad and I built what is essentially 138 feet of shelf space, and I've already filled it all with books!  Now I can work on alphabetizing the whole thing.  Maybe I should hire Steve to Dewey it for me?  I also installed high brightness flourescent lighting, so now I can see what I'm doing down there.  Now I need a reason to invite a whole bunch of people for some activity that will be 'fun' for everyone.  Poker tournament?  Advanced Squad Leader?  LAN party?  Or just club each other with sticks?

       urlLink ESPN.com - NHL - Red Wings beat Avs, who are winless in five   What a horrible game last night!  For one, the Avs didn't look good at all.  I do have to praise Legacy, but the quality of play by the Avs was poor.  Also, Koharski made what was probably the worst non-call in years.  The Avs goalie clearly had the puck cradled in his chest and looked for a whistle, but our favorite ref wouldn't give it to him.  In the ensuing scramble, the Wings got a CHEAP goal.  What a lousy, stupid, game-outcome-effecting non-call!  If I were a Wing's fan (God stike me down), I'd be ashamed of that goal.  Too bad.  I hope it's a better game on Saturday.

Quote - A spokesman for the French brigade in charge in northern Kosovo, Lt. Matthieu Mabin, said the violence had spread too quickly and across too wide an area. "We can't protect everywhere all of the time," he said. "It's the reality on the ground, very simply."    Yeah, let's turn Iraq over to the UN, as soon as possible!  That will make everything much better.

       urlLink CNN.com - Microsoft hit by record EU fine - Mar 24, 2004   This is why I could not run a massive multi-national corporation.  The EU has fined MSFT $613 million dollars for having a 'near monopoly' on the OS market.  Say what you will about MSFT, but this is just a shakedown of a deep pocket American corporation.  "Microsoft was also given 120 days to give programming codes to rivals in the server market, so their products can have "full interoperability" with desktop computers running Windows."  So essentially the EU is saying 'hand over your intellectual property to your competition, so as to be fair'.  Does anyone else see a problem with this?  And of course, the EU wants it both ways.   "CNN correspondent Jim Boulden said the EU wants a worldwide remedy and not a case where Microsoft has two operating systems: one for Europe and another for the rest of the world."  I bet they would.  They want what is available in the US, but they also want to fine MSFT for providing that same product.  Which is it?  If I were Gates, I would pull Windows from the EU.  I would shut down every product sale and terminate all distribution deals.  I wouldn't sell a single CD in the EU, and let them come begging for Windows.   I would ammend all contracts with Dell and Gateway to prevent them from shipping a copy of Windows bundled with an EU-bound PC.    And I'd probably lose a fortune and wreck the company.  But I would get much satsifaction from it at least.

       urlLink Death in Gaza   The NYT wrings its hands over the Hamas assassination.  It continuously amazes me to watch our own moral code contribute to an ever widening spiral of death.  We have spent a generation trying to mediate some peace in the middle east, urging restraint and struggling to keep the tensions from boiling over, resulting in nothing but continued murder.  For example - "Hamas has never accepted peace with Israel, and while Sheik Yassin was the group's spiritual leader, Israel accused him of responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks. Still, it's hard to see how his martyrdom will make Israel any safer. Hamas will now redouble its efforts to send human torpedos into Israel."  The NYT, like most, fails to recognize that this is a WAR.  It isn't a managed conflict, it isn't some 'cycle of violence', it's a war, and the sooner we treat it as a war, the sooner it will end and the sooner lives will be saved.  To fret that this killing will only increase the fighting is like being surprised that the Germans fought back in the Ardennes.  In a war, you fight harder when the other guy is making progress against you.  The misguided sense that we can negotiate an end to this is doing nothing but furthering the bloodshed.  By tying Israel's hands, we only embolden the murderous thugs to continue their operations.  It's time to allow this thing to end the only way it can.  It's time to recognize it as a war, and unleash both sides to fight it out and settle the issue.  Peace has NEVER lasted without total victory.  OUr efforts to break through this historical fact is only serving to maintain the misery.    Let Israel kill the Palestinian leadership.  Kill Arafat and his ilk.  Then establish their own governance there in Ramallah.  Colonize the Palestinians until they learn that peaceful coexistence is better than sending their children to explode in Tel Aviv.    The Wall Street Journal has a good column today www.opinionjournal.com.  They make some startling statements, such as the average Palestinian is a human being, with human desires.  It's amazing that we have reached the point where that seems radical.  The average Palestinian is so screwed up, so confused, and completely caught up in the lies of their leadership.  They are not blameless in all of this, but I believe they will respond as humans historically respond when faced with a simple choice - an improving life, or continued death.  So far, they haven't been free to confront this choice so long as thier leadership is immune from removal.  Let's get this war over with, for the sake of coming generations who have little more in their future but a bomb belt.

       urlLink Amazon.com: Books: Broken Angels   A change of course in what I'm reading right now.  I thought that after Altered Carbon, I would have to wait some time for Morgan's next book, Broken Angels.  I guess I wasn't paying attention, because Angels has been out for some time now, and I picked it up on the same day I bought the Koran and the SS book (again, I'm on someone's watch list).  Do yourself a favor and go get Altered Carbon.  Morgan is a masterful writer!  The highest quality of prose.  I'm about 90 pages into Broken Angel and it is more of the same - I'm pausing between chapters to just digest the prose, bask in it and fester in envy over what he is doing.  Go read it!

      Way down on the bottom of the page, an interesting argument was about to flare.  Steve was defending basketball by tearing down baseball, and Mark lept to the defence.  I'd like to see that one go on.  Mostly because I detest Basketball with the same passion I feel towards Hillary.  So let's have at it.  How can you defend such a pathetic 'sport'?  Basketball is all about the individual.  The team exists only to help the superstar get a bigger contract and attract more 'ho's.  FOrget the rules, forget travelling, forget the concept of a foul BY the money player (but he is ALWAYS fouled by the lesser player).  Forget even having a competition.  Like the Shaq inauguration in LA when they 'won' the title.  It's a mere formality.  The universe as a whole would be better off without basketball.  Give me baseball any day as an alternative.    Or Irish Hurling!  There's a man's sport.

       urlLink Democratic Underground Forums - US urges calm after slaying (Sheik Yassin assassinated) :  The DU is all ablaze over the Hamas killing.  I love the compassion for the murderous thugs. "Three Times as many Palestinians Have been killed by the IDF than Israelis by Palestinian suicide bombers. Where's your outrage over that? Or does Israel get a pass for being 'God's chosen people.'"  "Calm and Restraint?    Somehow I have a hard time seeing calm and restraint resulting from the death of poor Mr. Yassin."  And this - this is the most amazing.  This is why we need to ditch israel today.    "Whether its fair or not we are now fighting what is a spreading world war. Its going to be a long and very very difficult war given the best case scenarios.  Helping fan the flames of hatred in the muslim world against us is idiotic.  And maybe the israelis are 'right' but ultimately it doesn't matter, what matters is there is a 1.2 billion muslims and they view them as 'wrong'.  If we were infinetely strong we could pick and choose who was morally right or wrong. And in honesty if we find serbia 'wrong', we must find israel 'wrong'.  But we aren't infinetely powerful anyway so we have to ultimately do what we can, where we can."  So forget standing up for right and wrong...if the Muslims have the numbers, we should just abandon civilization and hope they don't hate us.  Appease them and pray that they leave us along.  Spineless Democrats!

       urlLink FOXNews.com - Top Stories - Hamas Spiritual Leader Killed in Israeli Strike   Hamas, Arafat, and all muslims vow the streets will run with Jewish blood yada yada yada.  Religion of Peace and all that...  In a related story, I purchased a copy of the Koran on Saturday.  I also purchased a book on the Waffen SS in WWII, so between the two books, I probably went on someone's watch list.  I started the Koran and I'll be sure to make reports back, if anyone is interested.  So far, the second Surah (The Cow) spends a lot of time dwelling on the Muslim duty to kill those that oppose them, and explains how Allah has fosaken the unbeliever.  In context, this Surah was released by Mohhamed at the same time he was at war with the Pagan Arabs at Mecca, and had just been sold up the river by Jewish allies.  Those muslims have long memories if they still hold the Jews accountable for a 1400 year old argument.  [2.6] Surely those who disbelieve, it being alike to them whether you warn them, or do not warn them, will not believe. [2.7] Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and there is a covering over their eyes, and there is a great punishment for them. [2.8] And there are some people who say: We believe in Allah and the last day; and they are not at all believers. [2.9] They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe, and they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive. [2.10] There is a disease in their hearts, so Allah added to their disease and they shall have a painful chastisement because they lied. [2.11] And when it is said to them, Do not make mischief in the land, they say: We are but peace-makers. [2.12] Now surely they themselves are the mischief makers, but they do not perceive. [2.13] And when it is said to them: Believe as the people believe they say: Shall we believe as the fools believe? Now surely they themselves are the fools, but they do not know. [2.14] And when they meet those who believe, they say: We believe; and when they are alone with their Shaitans, they say: Surely we are with you, we were only mocking. [2.15] Allah shall pay them back their mockery, and He leaves them alone in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on.

       urlLink FOXNews.com - Politics - White House Rebuts Former Adviser's Claims   The media's latest little darling - Richard Clarke.  Let's see what could motivate him -   1.)  He has a book coming out tomorrow. 2.)  He was demoted by Bush within the National Security COuncil staff after a 30 year career. 3.)  He has ties to the Kerry campaign and said that Clinton would have prevented 9/11.  He sounds like another so called 'apolitical' career government flack.  The same sort of people who work in the State Department and make secret calls to the NYT to make up stories about schisms between Powell and Bush.  So the President instructed Clarke to 'found out if it was Saddam' after 9/11.  I would be a little more concerned if the President said 'Don't look into Saddam and Iraq because the UN program is moving forward just fine.'    Why is Saddam so sacred to the Left?  Why are they so bent out of shape over going after Saddam, even if it turns out that he had nothing to do with 9/11?  Why are they trying to get us to live by these rules that we can't take out the bad guys until they hit us?  If you had a neighbor who was waving a gun around and threatening you, are you supposed to wait for him to actually shoot a family member before doing something about it?  If a crook waves a gun at a cop and later it is found to be unloaded, should we crucify the cop?  I just don't understand.  I don't understand the driving need to destroy what we have done.  I don't understand the need to weaken our nation for the sake of politics.    And now Hans is out with his book, saying the war was unjust and the UN was going along just fine.  I really would like to know why Saddam continued to dey us if he had already disarmed.    I'm still convinced the weapons are there somewhere.  They'll turn up in ten or twenty years, not that anyone will really care.

       urlLink Amazon.com: Computers: Apple 15 GB iPod M9460LL/A   I've had this now for about a week now, and I think it's time I said some things about it.  It is amazing.  Maybe the best electronic device I own.  There is nothing to compare with having almost your entire music collection in one little, portable box.  Pulling up a song is effortless, and I have to praise Apple for the elegance and beauty of the interface.  The jog 'dial' is the greatest little thing since the mouse scroll wheel.  (It really isn't a dial, more like a touchpad you would find on a laptop, serving as a mouse).  The battery life clocks in at 8 hours 16 minutes in my all day test.  I ran it non-stop at my desk while I was in meetings, just to see how long it would go.  The firewire synch is blazing fast, uploading a 5 MB song in under 3 seconds.  I'm rediscovering music, and have abandoned talk radio for the time being.  Coupled with the iPod, I signed up for iTunes, and have made quite a few purchases (see previous anti-piracy discussions for background).  By the way, if anyone gets a free song from Pepsi and have no intention of using it, shoot me the bottle cap code by email.  iTunes is a great service, and I'm finding all sorts of interesting things there.  While I didn't buy it, I found a Johnny Cash version of 'Personal Jesus', which is just surreal!    There are some notable absences from iTunes, such as Dave Matthews and Metallica, along with others.  I imagine this is a record label issue, but I don't know specifically which labels have opted out of the distribution deal.  I'll just buy what I need in real CD format and rip them to the computer.  It isn't a big deal, but I've enjoyed the convenience of downloading.  Anyway, there it is.  Greatest MP3 Player Ever.

I started with his Neutronium Alchemist series when I was in California, and the story just blew me away.  He writes BIG books (this one is 758 pages and probably the start of another trilogy).  Usually, when you finish one of his books, you don't want to stop.  As for just completed Altered Carbon - it was a terrific book!  That guy could WRITE!  Highly recommended.  The story was optioned by Hollywood, and I think it could be a great movie in the vein of Minority Report.  There is another book centered around the main character on the way, and I'll be certain to snap it up once it arrives.

       urlLink One Year After   The NYT comes out with the predictably asinine editorial on the war, one year later.  Of course, they completely miss the point.  "Asking a political leader to take his country to war in the teeth of overwhelming popular opposition is tough enough. Add to that a public that feels misinformed about the reasons for the war, and you've got political combustion. Polls show that a plurality of Americans say it was worth a war simply to remove a vicious dictator — an argument that Mr. Bush offered after it became obvious that his original justifications for the war were vaporous. But in Europe, there remains overwhelming popular opposition to the invasion of Iraq. Vice President Dick Cheney was wrong on Wednesday when he accused Spain of abandoning the war against terrorism by talking about withdrawing its forces from Iraq unless the U.N. becomes more involved. It's nonsensical to suggest that the Spanish people are appeasers, and doing so only isolates Washington further."  So after the terrorist whack Spain on the nose, the Spaniards pull their troops and denounce the war.  And that isn't appeasment??  What was it Churchill said to Chamberlin?  "You had a choice between war and appeasment.  You chose appeasment, now you will have war."

       urlLink Understanding Islam   I spent some time last night and today searching through Islamic messages boards, looking for some outrage about what is happening.  In most cases, the only outrage I could find was directed at the US and Bush.  I included a link here only as an example of the typical message activity.  You'll note few, if any, discussions about terror and the current state of Islam in the world.

       urlLink FOXNews.com - Top Stories - Several Dead in Basra Bombing   Yet ANOTHER car bomb explodes outside an Iraqi hotel, killing more people.  Allah be praised.  I am filled with rage against Islam this morning.  I am so utterly sickened by this so called religion.  Where are the condemnations from Islamic leaders?  Where are the Islamic charities rushing aid to their fellow muslims wounded and widowed by the blasts?   I'm so sick and tired of Europeans and UNers and World Leaders prattling on and on about the religion of peace, and how our war is not with Islam.  In the face of so much slaughter in the name of Allah, how can we continue to be so stupid and blind to the reality of what Islam is forcing upon us?    I hate that I have come to this.  Religious tolerance is indeed a cornerstone of our values, but a line has to be drawn when the tolerated religion is focused towards slaughtering all others in the name of their god.  Until a significant splinter of Muslims stand up and begin to preach against this nihilistic culture, I can't accord them any respect.  In fact, this morning I am lusting for the death of MORE muslims.  I want those that praise these bombings to die.  I want those who associate with these thugs to die.  I want to answer death with death, and some part of me is ashamed of what they are bringing me to.  We should begin executing al Qaeda people the same night a bomb goes off.  Wrap their pathetic bodies in bacon and leave them for the dogs to consume.  Begin summary executions of anyone found possessing arms in Iraq without authorization.  Preach hatred from a mosque - you die.  Shut down the religious schools and kill any teacher that praises violence in the name of Allah.  Pick up a stone and through it at an Allied soldier - you die.  I'm so tired of this.  I'm so tired of watching a whole region fester in barbarism for generations while the rest of the world tries to pretend that the root cause is Arab humiliation at the hands of those Zionist Jews.  They excuse Arab hatred by engaging in Semitic hatred.    We are at war with a culture of death, propogated by a religion of hate.  We are not going to civilize them by acting in civil ways.  The judicial system of our courts is not the appropriate way to deal with barbarians.  We need Roman ways in modern times.    And I really hate what that means.  I hate the death and the destruction, and I hate what they will force us to do in order to preserve our culture.  Best be harsh and brutal and be done with it.  The innocent people in Iraqi deserve a chance to build a decent culture, free from a thousand years of a failed faith.  Most of these people just want to live in peace, free to raise a family and make a living.  We have never experienced such opression in our own past, and it is difficult to imagine what this does to a societies will to resist the Islamist.  They need help, and I believe we have a duty to provide that help.  We can't hand them a new life, but those that wish to struggle and change deserve our attention.  As it is, our precious sensibilities against infringing on the religion of peace gets in the way of our ability to help those that would fight for freedom.  Let's get on with helping these people.  Let's get on with killing those that will never accept peace without the iron reign of a childish, hating, death loving diety.  Begin the Roman methods of pacification.  They worked in the past.

I have an intense bet with my buddy Damion over the Leafs/Bruins and who comes out on top for the season.  Todd, keep us posted, if I had more time I would gear up!  By the by, we got a new dog, trial period, see if it mellows out Pete to have a friend, but we don't have a name, I wanted Zeke, but Pete and Zeke sounds too similar apparently to the wife.  So I tried for Deke, but Heather didn't get it, but the dog spends his day faking and juking Pete and running past him, so I thought it was appropriate.  I think we are settling on Sampras, Heather will call him Sam, I will use the full name, so I can yell out of my house "Pete, Sampras!" every morning.  One last note, Mike, give us a post on your change of life plans, how is your talk with the counselor's and school going?  Any decisions?

      This is a great article I found on the internal news service.  Once again, drug re-importation is the issue.  Skip if you'd rather debate the merits of Marty Brodeur down below.  There is nothing Canadians cherish more than a chance to criticise their larger neighbour to the south. Sometimes the Canadian lust for one-upmanship is so great that it brings to mind the Mastercard ad campaign: "A chance to feel superior to the US? Priceless".  Still, it is not always easy living next door to the US, especially during a presidential campaign. Consider what this week is becoming campaign theme number one: the reimportation of US-made drugs from Canada. This idea is hard to grasp, especially as policy: US citizens buy drugs from Canada that were mostly made in the US to start with. Nonetheless, John Kerry is pushing for it. Republicans like it. And the positions they take will determine the future of one of the centrepieces of Canada's "I'm different" culture: its subsidised healthcare.  This is a story that starts with Canada and its decision to set itself two challenging goals. The first is to be a market-based country. The second is to be a social welfare state. Reconciling these goals is nearly impossible, as recent experience in Europe has shown. But Canada persists. One reason it does so is the aforementioned desire to set itself apart from the big, selfish, free-market US.  Nowhere is the Canadian difference more stark than in the area of health. The US relies on the private sector to insure its workforce; it provides a healthcare programme for the elderly, Medicare, but until recently there was no drug coverage for that age group. Canada rejects the market solution, following Britain and serving citizens with publicly funded doctors and hospitals.  On drugs, Canada has sought to balance a respect for patents and property (its capitalist side) with its desire for low prices and its dislike for pharmaceutical companies, which it views as price gougers.  Ottawa's thuggish compromise is to demand a lower price point from drug manufacturers for the Canadian market - and to threaten to strip away patent protection if the manufacturers don't give them those prices.  The drug companies, many American, have lived with this. After all, Canada accounts for only 2 per cent of the global drug market, compared with 37 per cent for the US. The whole arrangement - the healthcare, the drugs and the compromises - has meant enormous costs for Canada. Relatively few Canadians choose to become doctors and, of those who do, a significant number emigrate. Canada has fewer doctors per capita than Germany, Belgium, France, the UK and Poland. Modern technology is too expensive for the public sector, so  Canadians have access to fewer MRI machines and CT scanners than citizens of many other developed nations including Germany and France. Waiting lists for treatments by specialists average 18 weeks.* In the drug department, innovation has slowed.  Still, people cling to their illusions and Canada might have done so forever but for granny - US granny, that is. American senior citizens discovered that Canadian drugs were cheaper and began travelling over the border by Greyhound bus to purchase them. With the rise of the internet, suddenly Americans were ordering drugs from Canadian vendors by the thousands.  A consumerite media covered this as a free-market choice, rarely mentioning why Canadian drugs are cheaper. That was disingenuous: engaging in opportunistic arbitrage that exploits a price-control regime is different from buying on a truly free market. But politics nearly always trumps economics, and cheap drugs from Canada is proving a winning idea. Mayors from US towns and state governors are striking individual deals to buy cheaper drugs in Canada.  On Thursday, in a speech delivered in Evanston, Illinois (a town more Canadian than American in its culture), Mr Kerry assailed George W. Bush, saying that the president "stubbornly refuses to allow the importation of drugs while the prices are going steadily up".  And now even the Bush administration appears to be succumbing. Mark McClellan, who heads the Food and Drug Administration, last week softened his formerly iron opposition to reimports. Suddenly the possibility that the US might pass national legislation to formalise reimports becomes real.  Of course, the moment reimportation dents their all-important US market, the drug companies will simply stop giving Canada lower prices. Canada will then face a choice. Accept the higher prices (yet another challenge to its social commitment) or weaken patent law - not a good thing for a modern market-oriented country to do - and sell generics and copycats.  A happy free-market observer might once have theorised that the first choice, the higher prices for Canada, would be a good thing in the long run, ending Canadian free-riding and promoting innovation.  But that argument became hard to make as of last year, when the US Congress - again, with elections in view - passed its own law creating a new Canadian-style entitlement for the elderly: government-funded drugs. In other words, the US is putting unprecedented pressure on the Canadian system even as it is moving to emulate that system. On this one at least, you have to feel for the Canadians: they live with the consequences of Bush v Kerry, but they don't get to vote on them.

       urlLink CNN.com - Spain PM-elect: Troops out of Iraq - Mar 15, 2004   Many, many lessons should be taken from the Spanish elections over the weekend.  If you aren't up on your Spanish politics, let me recap.  Spain, along with Britain, was one of the primary allies in the Iraqi war.  They have around 1,600 troops in Iraq, and the Prime Minister, Aznar, put his neck on the line to help us, just like Tony Blair.  Just prior to the terror attacks, Aznar's party was in a tight race.  The muslims come along and murder 200 people a few days before the elections, and the Spanish people go into revolt.  As a result, the Socialist Party wins in a landslide.  The first thing the new Spanish PM vows is to yank the troops out of Iraq and offered support to John Kerry.  Lessons - The Muslims have learned if you whack a European hard enough, he'll comply with your wishes.  Instead of offering defiance and standing firm, the Spanish people rolled over and gave in.  They blame Bush for the Train attacks.  This type of thing seems to be endemic in Europe, and we should all take our own lesson from that.  The European way of appeasement is not the answer.  I'm sure there are many a sensible Spaniard who are in mental agony over the results of thier election.  I know I would be ashamed.  This is really a major even in the War on Terror, and it will cost us allies in the future.  Europe does not have enough Blairs to stand up against Islam.  And the Murderous Thugs of Mohhamed are encouraged to strike out again and again, exposing the softness in Europe.  If they slaughter another 1,000 Americans in late October, what will that do to our elections?  I'd like to believe that we would display the same resolve that held us together on 9/12 and beyond.  I'd like to think we would rally around resistence and defiance, rather than give in.  But I am increasingly concerned about our own level of committment and determination to preserve freedom.  As I've said, this election might be one of the most crucial elections since the 50s.  I think this might be a bloody year as the Muslims work to apply pressure against the current administration and policy.  How many people will be killed in an attempt to turn us away from confrontation?

I haven't made up my mind yet.  As much as I despise what she has done, I'm still not sure about it.  My instinct is to accord the fetus protection rights.  But I understand that the issue hinges once again on when does the fetus become a person a la abortion debate.  Personally, I'm utterly opposed to abortion.  But I'm not ready to codify my opposition into federal law.  I'd rather see Roe overturned and let each state handle it individually.    But I still don't know how I would prefer to see the law written.  There is the viability issue.  I think when you have viability, then the fetus transitions to a child and has rights.  But what is that point?  When do we define viability?  It will always be arbitrary and changing with technology.  No good answer.  But outside of the legal issues, this woman should have the crap beat out of her.

Quote - With yesterday's landmark speech, Paul Martin tacitly acknowledged what Canada's foreign policy establishment has refused to accept for decades: that the United Nations is a failure, for which there is no solution.  The Prime Minister's proposed alternative is a new international body, the G-20 summit of world leaders, representative of North and South, developed and developing, rich and poor: a working group unfettered by the UN's bureaucracy and its anachronistic Security Council.  .....  The problem with UN-based multilateralism is that it distances Canada from its natural allies, leaving us hostage to an institution over which we have little influence.  Canadians were sharply divided over whether to support the American-led coalition that toppled Saddam Hussein. Jean Chrétien decided Canada would not join without UN approval. Whether the invasion was right or wrong, the result of Mr. Chrétien's decision left Canada hostage to the French veto on the Security Council.  End quotes.  This is welcome news, and signs of returning sanity from our northern neighbor.

After the wailing and moaning about Bush making time to testify in front of the 9/11 commision (a commision DEMANDED by the Left), two of the Democrats leave the Q&A session early?    I think this illustrates that the 9/11 commision is just another political tool, used to pick apart the president and is not at all serious about trying to find out how 9/11 could be prevented in the future.    If Bush had the power, he should dissolve this commision and start over with serious people.  Appoint non-politicians, business leaders, security experts, military officers, whatever.  The commision DOES have a serious purpose, but when you have people sitting on the commision that had direct involvement with setting policy that hampered the ability of the FBI and CIA to share information (Jamie Gorelick, ex Dep AG), it is nothing more than a farce.

       urlLink Presidential Candidate John Kerry Opens Door for Rival Sharpton to Address Democratic National Convention   This is as exciting as the Howard Dean TV show!  Imagine Reverand Al in prime time.  Is it fair to judge Kerry by the company he keeps?  He speaks of Sharpton in words that imply respect.  What do you guys really know about Sharpton?  Here's a clip from Boortz about Sharpton's past.  Maybe Sharpton can use this speech to apologize to Steve Pagones.  Sharpton accused Pagones, a prosecutor, of raping Tawana Brawley.  Pagones later sued Sharpton and was awarded $345,000.  Sharpton has yet to apologize for his role in the Brawley affair, and his unfounded and slanderous accusations against Pagones and others.  While Sharpton's on a roll, maybe he can apologize to the family of Yankel Rosenbaum.  Rosenbaum was surrounded and stabbed to death by a Brooklyn mob shouting "kill the Jews." The crowd had been whipped into a frenzy by Al Sharpton railing against "diamond merchants" with "the blood of innocent babies" on their hands.  What was this all about?  A young black child was killed in a traffic accident.  A Jew was driving the car that killed him.  Sharpton can finish by apologizing to the families of the seven employees of Freddy's Fashion Mart in Harlem.  Freddy's, you see, was owned by a white Jew.  The owner of Freddy's rents his space from a black landlord.  He then rents a small portion of his space to a music store owned by a black man.  The black landlord raises the rent on Freddy's Fashion Mart.  This means that the owner of Freddy's, the white Jew, must raise the rent on the black man who owns the record store.  Enter Al Sharpton.  Sharpton starts leading demonstrations.  He screams to the crowd that "We will not stand by and allow them to move this brother so that some white interloper can expand his business."  Sharpton's mob starts yelling "Burn down the Jew store!" and "We're going to see that this cracker suffers."  A protester enters the store.  He warns all black customers to get out and then shoots four employees point-blank, then sets a fire.  Seven employees dead.  Sharpton owes them an apology.   End quote.  What does this say about Kerry, and the party as a whole?  What does this do to your sense of neutrality, Steve?  Is this a fair set of questions?

An example of the havoc of price controls on drugs.  Aventis is a French pharma, and they've been in trouble for a long time.  Sanofi is another French pharma, also not in the best of health.  Primarily, this is due to the price controls in Europe, which fail to reward R&D spending by limiting the profits gained on any drug.  Most of the EU pharmas are existing on drugs researched long ago, and most are reaching the end of their patent lifetime, meaning that they go generic and anyone can make them for cheap.  Few new drugs are in the pipeline, and that's where the money is really made.  Aventis was tendering offers to be bought, and Novartis, a Swiss company, issued an offer.  The Aventis shareholders were leaning toward accepting it.  Then the French stepped in and put a stop to it.  The French government, citing national security needs, flexed their muscle and encouraged Sanofi to make an offer for Aventis, and encouraged Aventis to accept.  Essentially, the Novartis offer would be stopped cold by law if it went forward.    So France artificially pushed two ailing French companies together as one large, ailing French company, and the shareholders of Aventis were forced to accept a lower price on thier stock.  The message to investors is - your money is not wisely invested in France.  I hope they lose capital over this.  The essential heart of capitalism is letting the market decide, and letting industry die if it cannot compete.  Propping up failing business does more harm than good.  Look at the steel industry in the US.  Or the airlines.  Let the market run it's course.  I hope the French and the rest of the EU keep right on making these decisions.  Viva la France.

      I think Eminem is talented.  There, that ought to get a reaction.  I don't listen to him, and I certainly don't like his genre of music, not in the least.  But I have heard a handful of his songs.  Last night I was checking out iTunes, and they now have music videos.  Not much of a selection, but a few.  I watched one by Eminem called Sing for Tomorrow, based upon an Aerosmith song.    That's when I decided that he actually had talent (and all of this is assuming he writes his own material, which is what I've heard).  I think precious few 'rappers' are more than just no-talent thugs pandering to a no-brain audience.  In listening to Eminem, I hear someone who really has something to say, albeit in a form I don't really appreciate.  So in the end, I respect him as an actual artist.

      Boortz had a good topic today on his web site.  Zell Miller from GA (A great Democrat, really!), has introduced a bill that would repeal the 17th Amendment.  That amendment established the popular election of US Senators.  Fundamentally, popular elections are a bad idea for the Senate.  The people have representation in the House of Representatives.  The Senate was established to represent the interests of the State.  Orignally, Senators were appointed by State Legislators and the Governer.  The population had no say beyond the election of their State officials, indirectly influencing who would be appointed.  So essentially, the States have had no official representation in DC since 1913, and the case for States Rights has declined since then.  We should restore the original intent of the Framers and repeal the amendment.  But I can't see it happening, since the average American is too uninformed to understand the ramifications.  The Left has managed to brainwash us into thinking we are a Democracy, and we should have a say in everything.

       urlLink Stephen R. Donaldson - Official Website   Holy Crap.  There's going to be four more Covenant books!  Part of me groans in potential pain, while another part is giddy with possibilities.  But why is he writing them?  Is it a crass exercise in harvesting money, or does he have something to say?  From the web site -   But if you've known the story for so many years, why did you wait until now to begin writing it?                That's complicated. One perfectly valid reason is that I wanted to prove to my readers--and to myself--that I could write other types of stories, and write them well. Another is that a significant number of other stories (in fact, twelve books' worth) came to me to be written. But perhaps the deepest, most personal reason is that I was afraid. At my first glimpse of "The Last Chronicles," I knew that it would be astonishingly difficult to write; that as a narrative exercise it would make the previous "Covenant" stories look like a stroll in the park. If this last story is done right, if it fulfills my intentions, it will complete and unify the entire saga. But in order to accomplish that goal I'll have to go far beyond my known abilities, both as a story-teller and as a writer. The prospect terrified me. It still does. The argument could be made that everything I've written since I first conceived "The Last Chronicles" has been an attempt to expand my abilities and resources; to make myself ready for the story I'm writing now.    We'll see.  Here's hoping that they live up to the first trilogy (and for you naysayers, I still maintain that the second trilogy was worth every moment.)

      Here's a meaty issue we might be able to scuffle over.  Unfortunately, I can't link the story since it is found on the Pfizer intranet.  The gist is - US Trade reps are going to start attacking price controls over seas on drugs, listing them as a trade barrier that must be removed.  The idea is to increase prices overseas so the foreign consumer pays thier fair burden of the R&D costs, and allows prices to come down in the US.  As it is, the US subsidizes R&D costs for the entire world through higher prices.  The interesting quote is as follows -   [Sen Jon Kyl, R-Ariz said] "'The answer in the U.S. is not that we should adopt price controls,' he said. 'We should work with other countries to reduce or eliminate price controls.'  Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said he agreed, but that 'leaving drug pricing policy entirely to drug manufacturers may not be the best idea either. The market has not contained prices that private plans and employers pay for drugs here in the U.S.'"  OK, think about that sentence - "leaving drug pricing policy entirely to drug manufacturers may not be the best idea..."  How about - "leaving soda pricing policy entirely to soda manufactureres may not be the best idea."  "leaving retail pricing of DVDs entirely to retail chains may not be the best idea."  Or how about - "leaving salary demands entirely to workers may not be the best idea..."  Why are drugs any different?

      I had a conversation with Mike a few nights ago about books.  He was buying The Confusion on-line, and needed another book to get free shipping.  I thought I'd try to get some conversation going on books by providing another edition of What I'm Reading.  I happen to have four books going right now, which is pretty unusual for me.  First.   urlLink  Pandoras Star   I actually started this book some time ago, put it down to make room for Broken Angels, and then came back to it.  This is my 'lunch' book, read during my lunch break here at work, so that's one of the reasons it's going slow.  Peter Hamilton is a great SF author, and the Night's Dawn Trilogy (actually 6 books) is a great romp in hard SF on an epic scale.  I would like to live in his imagination.  However, Pandoras Star seems a little scattered and disjointed.  I'm on page 500, and things are still a little confused for me.  I'm going to stick with it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else unless you are already a fan of Hamilton.  Second.   urlLink  Guns Up!    This was loaned to me by a guy here at work who happens to share an interest in war.  It's a paperback, so I'm reading it as my 'breakfast' book - meaning it is easy to stash in the pockey of my lab coat and take to the morning break, where I sneak a few extra minutes reading.  It's quick and interesting, following a Machine Gunner during his experience in Viet Nam.  You've probably heard that the average lifespan of a gunner in Nam was seven seconds after the shooting starts.    Third.   urlLink  Honor's Blade    Yes, a Star Trek book.  This is a guilty pleasure for me.  It's actually a collection of four books bound as one (purchased from the SF Book Club), containing My Enemy My Ally, The Romulan Way, Swordhunt and Honor's Blade.  Diane Duane wrote these quite some time back, laying out her version of the Romulan Empire, and I still wish they had adopted her work as the official version of the Romulan society.  The way they are portrayed in ST:TNG is just bad.  This is my 'read at home' book at the moment, since I don't want to lug Pandoras Star back and forth each day.  Fourth.   urlLink  1633    This is an eBook I downloaded for free through the Baen Free Library.  I read it on my iPaq before meetings (or sometimes during meetings) or any other moment where there is a lull.  Problem is - it's HORRIBLE.  1633 is a sequel to, oddly enough, 1632.  It's another schlock time travel story where a coal mining town in West Virginia is mysteriously transported to 1632, smack in the middle of Europe during the Thirty Years War.  The writer is a self-described Marxist, and former Union organizer in West Virginia.  So you have a cast of characters that read like a roster from the Democratic Convention, trying to impose Leftist values on 17th century Europe.  There is some crotchety old 60's hippy who tries to prevent them from building a military, or wants to negotiate with the European powers, rather than fight.  There is an industrial magnate who ended up in this small town during the transfer (his son was getting married), and he's the heavy - primarily because he has the right ideas about how to build a functioning society based upon profit.  Can't have that!  I read 1632 because it was free, and it made me laugh.  I'm not quite sure why I'm reading 1633, except for the completely insane social commentary.  So, there we have it.  Anyone else reading something worth talking about?

      Kind of amusing.  I'm in a small meeting with a guy here, talking about an issue that has come up.  We're in the snack bar, and someone is there setting up Pfizer logo clothing and accessories, exhibiting the merchandise now available for purchase.  I point it out, and mention I'd like to go take a look.  This guy then replies, "Back when I was a professional fisherman..."    The rest of the his words were lost to me as I pondered what he had just said.  "Excuse me?"  So he tells me about his days as a pro fisher and how he would get boxes of logo merchandise, a free bass boat, fuel and so on.  I gained an insight on the insanely competitive world of fishing as he regailed me with stories of treachery, gamesmenship and victory.  I guess I never expected to meet a pro fisherman working in a pharmaceutical plant.  I'm now on a quest to find a Bocce Champion.

They live in delusion - such as 'our culture is superior', 'our military will destroy you', 'we will crush Israel' and so on.  They throw rocks at the people trying to help them, riot over the slightest insult, and refuse to accept the reality of their situation.  Now they are angry because their flag 'contains the colors of Israel'.  Come on....

       urlLink WheretodoResearch.com - Memorable Presidential Quotes   Behold the wisdom of the past, in pithy quotable form. Here are some gems from Ronaldus Magnus:  "Millions of individuals making their own decisions in the marketplace will always allocate resources better than any centralized government planning process."  "America is too great for small dreams."  "There can be no real peace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us.  We are at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars, and it has been said if we lose that war, and in so doing lose this way of freedom of ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening.  . . .  If we lose freedom here [in America], there is no place to escape to.  This is the last stand on Earth."  This one hit me hard:  "Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us that they have a utopian solution of peace without victory.  They call their policy 'accommodation.'  And they say if we only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he will forget his evil ways and learn to love us.  . . .  We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now in slavery behind the Iron Curtain, 'Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skin, we are willing to make a deal with your slave-masters.'" (October 27, 1964)  Anyhow, an interesting site that I plan to read fully.

      What I have read:  Dune - I read it.  Finished it last night.  Took me awhile, only because I could not "skim read" like I usually do, I had to actually read every word so as not to miss any of the subtleties of it.  I was impressed.  A book that held up to the hype.  The way that Herbert gave you information, without seeming to give information was astounding.  He would drop numerous references in dialogue that were major points of action of a character, but not reveal the actual MEANING of the reference for 200 pages, yet he did it without frustrating me.  I have thought about this for days, and I can't figure out how exactly he did it.  Maybe because the background was so alien yet so similar, I found I didn't WANT to know everything about everything, I liked the mystical mystery.  During every traditional action plot point that was resolved, there was also a resolution of minor background and character motivation points as well.    In all, I would say the most impressive example of how to tell without telling, how to tell JUST enough and how to weave together an amazing amounts of intricate plot points with each other.  I think, and I think this is true of all Sci-Fi/Fantasy, it all starts with such a detailed, well thought out and plausible universe.  I could tell that Herbert probably had tons of volumes of writings, notes and prep work to build the universe that never even made it into the book, or were only casually mentioned.    The ONLY major issue I had, was the ability of the elder Liet to sway the Fremen and find a place among them, when it was obvious from Paul and Jessica's interaction that that was next to impossible.  Somehow, the Liet's were seen as ultra-powerful, yet not a threat to an individual sietch like Paul was.  Also, was Liet ever considered part of a Prophecy, like Paul, which I think was a major reason he was allowed to live.  Herbert tries to smooth that point over with an epilogue describing the elder Liet's introduction into the Fremen society, and his ability to introduce his ideas and radically alter the Fremen existence, but it was still a bit weak to me.    I would recommend this book, re-read it if you have read it before.  Todd, it is applicable to your work for his ability to hold meetings and conversation that didn't seem there just to pass information.  I am tempted to dive into the further works of Dune, but am leery if only because I think maybe it's best to just wonder, I may be disappointed with the literal answers (ala, The Force in Star Wars!).  What do you guys think, should I continue to read more Dune?  I'm also going to watch the movie again, though I will be getting it from the library, God save my soul.

       urlLink CNN.com - Bush touts tech moves in?Minnesota - Apr 26, 2004   Bush proposes a ban on taxing broadband connections, and predictably, the Left is 'outraged'.  "The Bush broadband policies don't do anything to provide the new resources that will be needed to deploy broadband in rural and urban areas and they are not addressing the regulatory barriers that prevent deployment.  "There is a bill before Congress -- that has been championed by John Kerry -- that gives tax incentives to companies to deploy broadband in underserved areas," Cutter continued.   This is another fundamental difference between the Left and Right.  The Left uses taxes as a means of engineering change, by trying to force the market to do things that shouldn't be done.  Why should money be spent to run broadband to rural areas when there is no profit in doing so?  Rural customers should pay more to defray the cost of the infrastructure and service.  To require utilities to absorb cost and reduce profits is riduculous.  If you choose to live in the country, you must accept the sacrifices that come with that choice.  Why should we have to subsidize your lifestyle?  Should we also subsidize a cinema megaplex in every town smaller than 10,000?  How about access to a Best Buy?

      A brief update of my first official hockey game last night.  First, we have a great team.  My guys are fast and skilled, and I think we are going to do well.  However, the other team was extremely fast and skilled as well.  I also watched the game before mine, and those teams were fast and skilled.  I've been placed in Division I, so the vast majority of skaters are quite advanced.  Honestly, I've only seen hockey this well played a handful of times in my in-line 'career', and I'm going to be VERY busy.  This is a good thing, and I'm looking forward to playing at this level.  I played well, but poorly at the same time.  There were quite a few occasions where I got a piece of the puck, but it went in anyway.  I felt good about reading the play and being in the right place, but my execution wasn't as good as it should be.  I have a history of playing poorly in the first game of a season, so we'll see if I improve.  And yes, I'm avoiding telling you the score....  We won, 13-11.  Yes, 11!!!  You shouldn't give up 11 goals and win.  I was mortified, but my team didn't seem to be troubled by it.  I think there was a least 6 goals I SHOULD have stopped, the rest were difficult situations that would be goals at least 60% of the time.  The puck just kept squeezing by me, even though I'd get a piece.  And these guys can shoot!  Everyone seemed like they had a heavy shot with pinpoint accuracy.  That's probably why they kept going in - they had so much force, I couldn't seem to deflect them even when I got a piece.  So, I'm embarrased, but happy we won.

Now the thugs will know we are afraid of them and their mythical "Arab Street." This will result in more lives lost and wasted time. If we just let the marines do their job and kill our enemies this could be over in a few days. By letting it sit and fester we are making violence more likely.  I thought Bush was supposed to be giving the military free reign to do the job. But now I know he's just another spineless weakling bent on retaining power. he may still acquire my vote, but it won't be for his decision in this crisis.  Anyone care to argue that this is a good idea?

But I know it's a long road, and I wouldn't dream of extrapolating an outcome based on one game.  For either series.  But there is a lot at stake here for everyone involved.  We all know that our personal value as human beings is solely dependent on how far our team advances in the finals.

      I nearly forgot my hockey update.  Not much to say really.  We only had 4 skaters and two goalies, so the night was pretty much a bust.  The rink operators refunded all of the money but let us skate the session anyway, which I thought was classy.  We did some full rink 2 on 2 just to screw around, and I felt pretty comfortable out there.  My endurance is increasing, and I'm certainly getting the old moves back.  I still can't seem to keep the puck in the glove though.  No problems 'catching' it, but I loose the handle.  So I need a new glove.  First game is Sunday at 9 PM.

      I'm having a 'Matrix' moment at work today.  I'm sitting here, and suddenly the absurdity of my life comes home to me.  Particularly with work.  It's like everything around me is all wrong, and I'm living someone else's life.  I shouldn't be doing this.  It isn't correct.  Yet I'm stuck with it.  I think I've learned, over the past six or seven years, that it isn't the job that is a problem - it's the choices I've made.  The idea of another 30 years of this looms over me, and it certainly isn't appealing.  Last week I had to go to an all day training where a man gave a presentation on the new Quality System we are rolling out here.  It's derived from Six Sigma, if that means anything to you.  Anyway, this guy was passionate about it.  He's been doing this for twenty years, and you could tell that he absolutely loved it.  I watched him for 8 hours, and thought about the fact that he had already done the same presentation three times that week, with another one to go after ours.  He travels to all the Pfizer sites to work on this.  And he just loved it.    I admire that kind of passion.  I wish I had it for this work, but I don't, and I can't pretend that I ever will.    Something isn't right with my world.    How about you?

       urlLink CNN.com - Grand jury indicts Jackson - Apr 22, 2004   I'm struggling with my reactions over this.  Not that I'm investing a great deal of energy on it, but when I heard the news last night, my reaction wasn't clear to me.  On one hand, there's little doubt Jackson is a COMPLETE freak, but that isn't against the law.  Certainly, if he isn't guilty, he has exercised extremely poor judgment by placing himself into constant situations were credible allegations can be made.  On the other hand, it isn't a stretch to imagine that he is quite guilty.  It's easy to assume the truth in the allegations.  But that isn't the proper way to look at things.  He's innocent until proven otherwise, but I struggle to keep that in mind.  I have no schedenfreude over the idea of him going to prison.  He isn't a complete human being, and I can't imagine what prison life, even in a luxury prison, would do to him.  It doesn't give him a pass, of course.  If he's guilty, lock him up.  But he needs to get a fair shake in the legal system.  Like I said, it isn't a crime to be a freak and to display poor judgment.  I hope the process gets to the bottom of things.

       urlLink CNN.com - Pentagon officials grilled about?war's cost - Apr 21, 2004   Chuck Hagel is back.  Quote - Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska told NBC that the administration needs to "be honest with the Congress, be honest with the American people."  "Every ground squirrel in this country knows that it's going to be $50 billion to $75 billion in additional money required to sustain us in Iraq for this year," said Hagel, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which also held hearings on Iraq.  Yeah, it's pretty obvious that Iraq and Afghanistan is going to require additional budget appropriations.  To think that the White House is trying to 'hide' the obvious is kind of silly.  Who DOESN'T think it's going to cost more?  According to Richard Myers, they are working on the accurate estimates before submitting the request.  I'm sure we'll see it before the election.  Besides, if they came in either high or low, the Left would shriek about either 'trying to mislead' or 'overspending'.  Why go through that?  Just wait until you have a good solid number.  Again I have to question the seriousness of the people complaining.  Any reasonable person knows what's at stake here.  Why do we continue to put our own operations, resolve, and soldiers at risk for the sake of political points when the outcome is so crucial to our future?  Is it really that difficult to get behind the idea that we are at war?

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Senator says US may need compulsory service to boost Iraq force   Chuck Hagel is bandying about the idea that we need to begin a draft to fill out the ranks in the Iraq Campaign.  Never mind that the recruiting goals have been exceeded, and while some are selecting to leave the service, many more are answering the call.  While Iraq is tying up a lot of soldiers, we aren't in any real danger of being short of manpower.  The issue ultimately is the appropriate use of the bodies we have in theater.  Chuck Hagel has an 'R' after his name, but he's more of a RINO (Republican In Name Only).  If you google him, he has a long history of being against the war, and he's consistently a thorn in Bush's side.  Talk of draft is just another way to scare people and get his face on the TV.  What is it they say?  Not a single Senator can shave in the morning without seeing a President in the mirror.  A draft is really a dumb idea (aside from an Armageddon scenario where the US is being invaded).  Conscripts make lousy soldiers.  They get killed, and they get others killed.  Any sensible human being would rather serve in a volunteer outfit.  At least that way you know the guy next to you has chosen to be there, and is likely to hold up.  We've proven, in the post Viet-Nam era, that a volunteer force is the best way to wage war.  Calls for a draft are nothing more than irresponsible, unneccesary scare mongering, and makes little military sense.  Don't pay any attention to Hagel.

      Latest Hockey Report.  I had practice again last night, and we had a much better turnout.  Unfortunatelyl, I was still the only goalie there.  The gear felt much better this time.  I didn't really feel like I was wearing it, and my motions were much more natural.  I have to do something about the skates though.  Two years ago when I started playing in Peachtree City, I bought a nice pair of Mission blades, but for some reason, I purchased size 10 when I normally wear size 11.  By the time I questioned why I was experiencing so much pain, it was too late to return them.  I'm soldiering on with them now, but it can't go on without me ending up crippled.  The session went very well this time.  I managed about 75 minutes of play without taking a break, and most of that was pretty vigorous action.  I had a few dumb moments, like missing the puck completely when it rolled in on me as I tried to shoot it to a defensemen.  An another occasion, I missed a poke check by about ten feet and laid there like a beached whale while the guy stepped over me and shot into the empty net.  But I had some great moments too.  Some nice lateral saves.  Some very nice glove work that surprised even me.  I think I'm gaining some respect there, and I had at least two people arguing over which team I would be assigned to play on (they both wanted me).  So I think this is going to be a fun place to play provided the turnout improves.  Another session tonight, so I'll provide another short report tomorrow.

So far, we've had very little in the way of active discussion about things.  Is it because of the topics?  Are people not interested?  What can we do to get more action here??  I mentioned a few weeks back that I was looking for ways to get more people involved, and I'm no closer to an idea.  Anyone else have some thoughts?    Help me make this a better site.

      Meaningful to me...  WHY WRITE?  George Orwell considered the question in an essay, "Why Do I Write?" (first published in "Gangrel, No. 4" in the summer of 1946.) He came up with one of the most thoughtful responses you are likely to find. It reads, in part:    "...Putting aside the need to earn a living, I think there are four great motives for writing, at any rate for writing prose.  They exist in different degrees in every writer, and in any one writer the proportions will vary from time to time, according to the atmosphere in which he is living.  They are:    "1) Sheer egoism.   Desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on the grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc., etc.  It is humbug to pretend this is not a motive, and a strong one.  Writers share this characteristic with scientists, artists, politicians, lawyers, soldiers, successful businessmen -- in short, with the whole top crust of humanity. The great mass of human beings are not acutely selfish.  After the age of about thirty they almost abandon the sense of being individuals at all -- and live chiefly for others, or are simply smothered under drudgery.  But there is also the minority of gifted, willful people who are determined to live their own lives to the end, and writers belong in this class. Serious writers, I should say, are on the whole more vain and self-centered than journalists, though less interested in money.    "2) Aesthetic enthusiasm.  Perception of beauty in the external world, or, on the other hand, in words and their right arrangement.  Pleasure in the impact of one sound on another, in the firmness of good prose or the rhythm of a good story.  Desire to share an experience which one feels is valuable and ought not to be missed.  The aesthetic motive is very feeble in a lot of writers, but even a pamphleteer or writer of textbooks will have pet words and phrases which appeal to him for non-utilitarian reasons; or he may feel strongly about typography, width of margins, etc.  Above the level of a railway guide, no book is quite free from aesthetic considerations.    "3) Historical impulse.  Desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity.    "4) Political purpose   -- using the word "political" in the widest possible sense. Desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter other peoples' idea of the kind of society that they should strive after.   Once again, no book is genuinely free from political bias. The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.    "It can be seen how these various impulses must war against one another, and how they must fluctuate from person to person and from time to time...    "...All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery.  Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.  For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention. And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one's own personality."

      I had my initial hockey practice last night.  A chance to strap on the new gear and figure out if I can still play this game.    My goal for the night was to engage in some stretching, sweat a lot, and go through the motions so as not to strain anything.    That covered the first five minutes.  As is the custom at most rinks, goalies play for free.  They were having a referee 'training' session for the upcoming league starting on Sunday, so most of those guys joined us a few minutes after we started.  There were a grand total of nine of us, with me being the only goalie.  I expected a higher turnout, but I later learned that this is the first open hockey session they've ever done, and the word hasn't really circulated yet.  With three rinks, I'm shocked to hear this.  The new gear worked quite well, but it's going to take me some time to adjust.  The flak vest is instantly appreciated, as I took some shots that would have stung me with the old gear.  The leg pads are going to take quite a bit of adjustment.  They are like playing with a trampoline; when I drop to my knees, I literally bounce.  And since they haven't been scuffed yet, they tend to stick to the play surface.  That's a bigger deal, since my lateral motion will suffer.  I made maybe three saves that required more than token effort.  The rest of the time, I played the shots, and let the close in fakes go by.  No sense in straining anything right off the bat.  After about an hour of play, I reverted to my orange cone impression, waving my hands at the puck as it went by, and not moving too much.  The exhaustion was remarkable.  It's been too long since I've done this, and I have a long way to go to return to my Central Arena days (if ever).  I quit about 30 minutes early, and the guys there were quite nice about it.  It's a bad sign when you have to stop half way through undressing, to take a rest.    I have another session on Tuesday, and then again on Wednesday, so the plan is to ramp it up and reach full play aggressiveness by Wednesday.  The league organizer asked me if I'd like to serve two teams this season, since they are short on goalies.  I agreed, but that was before the practice started.  Now I'm uncertain, but I'll foolishly agree and sufffer for it later.  More later....

       urlLink USNews.com: Mortimer B. Zuckerman: The U.N. and the Iraq oil-for-food scandal (4/26/04)   While we are talking about the 'rationale' Left, let me bring this up from the latest US News.  It seems France and Russia, along with the UN scam, really had thier hands in the Iraqi cookie jar.  Quote -   Here's how the scam allegedly worked: Saddam sold oil to his friends and allies around the world at deep discounts. The buyers resold the oil at huge profits. Saddam then got kickbacks of 10 percent from both the oil traders and the suppliers of humanitarian goods. Iraqi bean counters, fortunately, kept meticulous records.  Coincidence. If you wondered why the French were so hostile to America's approach to Iraq and even opposed to ending the sanctions after the 1991 Gulf War, here's one possible explanation: French oil traders got 165 million barrels of Iraqi crude at cut-rate prices. The CEO of one French company, SOCO International, got vouchers for 36 million barrels of Iraqi oil. Was it just a coincidence that the man is a close political and financial supporter of President Jacques Chirac? Or that a former minister of the interior, Charles Pasqua, allegedly received 12 million barrels from Baghdad? Or that a former French ambassador to the U.N., Jean-Bernard Merimee, received an allocation of 11 million barrels? Perhaps it was just happenstance, too, that a French bank with close ties to then French President François Mitterrand and one of the bank's big shareholders who is close to Saddam became the main conduit for the bulk of the $67 billion in proceeds from the oil-for-food program. All told, 42 French companies and individuals got a piece of this lucrative trade. No matter how cynical you may be, it's sometimes just plain hard to keep up with the French.  But they're not alone. Russians received more than 2.5 billion barrels of the cut-rate crude. Some 1.4 billion barrels went to the Russian state. Not to be left out of the feeding frenzy, even the U.N. got in on the action. It received administrative fees of about $2 billion for the program, which may be fair, but the senior U.N. official in charge of the program, Benon Sevan, is reported to have received 11.5 million barrels himself. Cotecna, a Swiss-based firm hired by the U.N. to monitor the import of the food and medicine to Iraq, hired Kojo Annan, the son of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, as a consultant during the period when the company was assembling and submitting bids for the oil-for-food program.  End Quote.  Give all of this, can we question John Kerry's seriousness when he continues to claim that the Iraqi War is wrong because we did not have international support?  Can we continue to respect his claims that only the UN can give the war an imprimatur of legitimacy?  Or can we assume that John Kerry is not a serious man?

      An update on my loss of data (see below).  Apple responded to my problem by allowing me to download ALL of the music I have purchased to date, with the 'warning' that this is a one time exemption.  Fair enough.  If I had bought a CD from Best Buy and snapped it in half, I can't very well expect them to replace it, right?  We need to get over this thinking that digital data is unlike any other product.  Just because I CAN copy it ad infinitum ad naueseum doesn't mean that I SHOULD, or that I have the RIGHT to do it.  Apple has reasonable restrictions on these files, and they do not inconvenience me at all.  I can still burn all the Audio CDs I want.  I can copy them to other computers, but only three machines at a time can be authorized to play them.  And of course there is the iPod, which doesn't count.  About the only thing I can't do is email a compressed file to a friend.  I'm free to burn it as a CD format and do what I please though.  (Technically, I can only burn a playlist 10 times, but then I can simply move a song to a new position on the list and get 10 more burns, so it's really a token restriction).  So in short, I'm still happy with my decision to go legit.

       urlLink IRAQ THE MODEL   I'm starting to believe that real Blogs (not like this one, which isn't really a Blog) have a legitimate place in the journalism universe.  More and more, we are seeing stories being picked up and examined in the Blogosphere, and eventually noticed by the traditional outlets.  The well-produced Blogs are like having hundreds or thousands of freelance reporters combing the datanet for obscure events, and the important stories are being picked up and magnified in a self-reinforcing cascade.  The good stuff floats up.  Here is a link I found from Glenn Reynold's site (instapundit.com), regarding a Blogger who has been reading Arabic chat rooms.  Quote - "I've been visiting the BBC Arabic site in the last few days and I found a forum where people from many Arab countries –including Iraq- post their opinions about some hot topics, the main of those is Iraq and terrorism of course. I wasn't surprised to see that most Arabs (especially from Egypt, Palestine, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Syria) are forming one side of the debates while Iraqis and people from the rest of the gulf countries are taking the other side. But I was surprised when I found that the almost all the Iraqis who took part in the debates are on our side, maybe 95% of Iraqis expressed their rejection to the violent behavior of some Iraqis and condemned the terrorists attacks on both Iraqis and the coalition saying that the Arab world must stop supporting the terrorists and the thugs from inside Iraq. "  Interesting reading.  And it is encouraging to know that my belief in the average Iraqi is well founded.  Despite occasional bouts of depression over the situation, FUndamentally, I do believe the average Iraqi is on board with this whole thing.  That's why it is so important not to give in to the constant Established Media spin cycle of Viet Nam, Viet Nam, Viet Nam...

      Well, I had a fairly lousy evening last night.  I got home to hear Diane tell me the power went out at around 4 PM.  That explained why the police were directing traffic at the light up the street.  The entire neighborhood was out, and we didn't know why.  Of course, Diane is in to the Apprentice, and I admit I wanted to see how it turned out (I had picked Bill about six weeks ago).  Plus there were plenty of Hockey games on, and I also had some writing to get done.  It's amazing how dependent we are on power.  We didn't get it back until 12:30.  8.5 hours!  Completely unacceptable.  I'm thinking that an 8.5 hour outage should require some disaster on the magnitude of an asteroid strike, terrorism, or a rampaging Ted Kennedy on a bender.  I still don't have an answer.  For a time, I felt like a resident of Bombay...

      Here's a question for you guys:  A company donates a million doses of a cough medication for distribution in the third world, helping people in need.  A fine act of charity?  But what if that same company was going to have to scrap that medicine, and instead received a nice tax write off for the donation?  Does that change the 'worthiness' of the donation?  Or does it matter?

       The Future of America?   Today I sat in my Science, Technology, and Society class. The class focuses mainly on religion, which to me is a waste of time. No one is going to learn anything about religion in a classroom that will matter in their lives. Anyhow, today's topic was focusing on war and religion. Specifically the conflicts between Israel/Palestine and between Islam and civilization.   The format was to have students present a topic, give their views, and then we discuss it in a orderly fashion. Order was maintained, but sometimes rather poorly. I of course am the 400 lb. gorilla in the room, with cogent and well-articulated views on all things.   The first presenter painted a picture of the Palestinians as poor, oppressed victims and the Israelis as modern fascist oppressors. I took umbrage and informed the class that the Palestinian's plight is a result of their fellow Muslims refusing to open their countries and take them in. Countries like Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, etc. Instead they fuel the hatred at an "unjust" situation. I also remarked that this situation is voluntary because they could just stop fighting and join all their fellow arabs already living as full citizens of Israel. Those pearls of wisdom were met with disbelief and suspicion. The professors in charge of the class did acknoledge the truth of my claims, but they forwarded the position that "the cycle of violence has to stop." I did not get an opportunity to offer my solution to the cycle: allow total victory for one side and total defeat for the other. It is the only way to truly end any conflict.   After this were a trio of women presenting. They talked about religions motivating people to kill other people. Kamizaze, Timothy McVeigh, and suicide bombings/ 911 were discussed. We focused mainly on what can justify killing and specifically why the USA is hated around the world. All 3 of the women had foreign accents, and one said she was from "another country." The general consensus of the class was that America was evil, we had no business being the world's policeman, and that we were wrong to try to force our values and society on other peoples. They asked the class if any of us had something, some idea that we would die for. Amid the chuckles, my voice could be heard: "For my country." After further chuckles and head-shaking I amended my statement: "Well, maybe not for some of YOU, but I would for my country."   We all moved along right over that little outburst. It did make me realize that I would die for my idealized country. Until I said it, it wasn't real for me. But now I am fully aware that the idea of America is worth dying for.   From there we moved into discussing Iraq. In general, the class members remarked that it was unjustified, and that we were being bullies and oppressing people around the world. A Lebanese woman told us that the opinion of the US in her country of origin was that of a selfish, greedy thug. I almost went insane at that instant. I didn't get a chance to inform her that if we were truly greedy and thuggish, that she would know it in an instant.   I put the professoress in her place though. She tried to play the game of moral justification with us. "Why did we go into Iraq and not Rwanda?" I fired back: "So you're saying that unless we can help everyone we should help no one?" She said then "But it seems we only invaded Iraq to help ourselves. If there wasn't oil there we wouldn't be there."   "So what? Gas prices are only going up. If it was for oil then why aren't we getting oil cheaper? Besides, it only makes sense for us to help where we gain something by doing so. Helping with only gain for one side is worse than helping people and gaining benefit from it. The Iraqis are better off now than they were under Saddam. We're better off now than we were before the invasion."   "But how are we going to get out of this? How can we put an end to it?" This is a paraphrase unfortunately. I don't remember her comment at this point.   "To answer that, I might be saying something offensive but its the truth: We colonize them. We force them to conform to our values and that way we can leave."   At this point the subject was changed by some classmate. But I know I was right. Unfortunately, most of those present sided with the professor. They remained convinced that America was bad, our motives suspect, and that suicide bombers are justified because they are defying our oppression.   An atheist Jew classmate, who talks with me occasionally, summed it up best: "What a bunch of f-ing idiots."

       urlLink CNN.com - Bushes report $822,126 in adjusted gross income - Apr 13, 2004   This is why it is hard to get good people to run for office.  Bush could make three times this month in the private sector, and Cheney probably even more.  I think we should look at paying our elected officials much more, to attract really qualified people.  Imagine if each Senator made $5 million per year.  Suddenly you have the smartest, most driven private sector people considering the job.  Pay the President $100 million for a four year term.  Maybe Jack Welch would run.

      From the 'No Attempt to Do Good Should Go Unpunished Department"...  After my resolutions last month to go legitimate on my software, I managed to construct a dual boot situation on my PC, where I would run my Windows copy next to Linux.  The idea was to spend time learning Linux, so I could dump my unclean copy of Windows and no longer make Bill Gates my personal slave.  Over the past few weeks, it is clear to me that the two operating systems were not playing along together.  I was getting steady file corruption.  So this weekend I decided to clean out my system and return to a single boot Windows XP configuration for the time being, while putting Linux on my second PC so I can continue to learn.  Well, somewhere in the process, the corruption spread.  I lost a pretty good chunk of data (mostly replaceable), and all my iTune downloads (which may not be replaceable).  When you purchase a song from iTunes, you pretty much have to protect that data, since you can't download it again.  I had about $97 worth of music I had purchased over the past month, and it's all gone.  There is a small chance Apple will have pity on me and let me download it again.  I've contacted customer service, and await a reply.  There is some hope, as I've read of Apple having pity on others who have suffered crashes.  So I'm sure the wanton pirates out there will feel smugly superior over my misfortune.  Personally, this experience doesn't change my perspective, even if I the money and files are lost.  What price can be applied to your own values?  So laugh away.  It is pretty funny.

The best line was during a reply, showing only Mickelson hitting the putt and watching as it rolled toward the hole.  The commentator simply said - "Watch, as his life changes."  These are the moments for which we watch.

       urlLink boortz.com: Nealz Nuze Today's Nuze   I have to steal a quote from the Boortz page this morning.  "War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.  The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling that thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.  The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself."   .... John Stuart Mill.  I'm reading the two accounts of families losing people in the war in the past week (on the Drudge page as of this morning), and I have mixed feelings.  Of course it's tragic that this is going on, and these families are losing people.  I have no immediate family in theater, so it is hard for me to truly place myself in that situation and understand what it's like.  But I don't think that can change the fact that this is worth doing.  Not idividually, not to each person involved, but in the larger picture, it is worth it.  That is an unfortunate fact of nations - while we strive to seek individualism, there are a few endeavors that require a group mentality.  War is one of them.  Everyone who puts on the uniform should have a complete understanding of what that means.  Many see it as a path to college, or a relatively prestigious career with little risk in a peaceful world.  When things change, these risks are a consequence of serving in the military.  Of course, it is essential that we can trust that our leadership is using the military in an appropriate fashion, but they MUST be free to use the military when the time comes.  If we left it to every parent of a soldier, then there would be very little war.  No one WANTS to see thier kids fight and die, but sometimes it is required.  I saw Bush on TV last night, and it struck me how old he looks.  Hollow skin around the neck, white hair, and a face as lined as a rumpled sheet.  He looked about 120 years old, and I recalled thinking he looked too young during the 2000 election.  My houseguest last night exclaimed that BUsh should be sent to Iraq with nothing more than a non-functional pellet gun, as he was a heartless bastard.  I didn't bother commenting on the foolishness.  I'm certain every president who has ever had to order the death of a 19 year old soldier has felt it deeply.  But they gave that order, and we are a better nation because of it.  The best thing we can do for those serving over there is to stand firm, and make it clear to the leadership that we expect them to take the gloves off and fight as they are capable of fighting.  We want them home, but we want the job finished.  The slow, steady drip of casualties stems from the desire to limit the conflict, save 'civilian' lives and to keep the world liking us.  I think it's more important we save our own people by letting them do what they do so well.  Victory, low casualties, and quick resolution: pick two.

       urlLink My Way News   It's interesting to read of the Japanese reaction to the hostage situation.  There are old traces of the 1930s Japanese culture still lurking inside them - the old steel.    They aren't going to pull out, and if the Islamist actually immolate the hostages, it's going to be fascinating to see how the rest of the world reacts.  Will there be sincere outrage from the Islamic world?  Will the EU realize what we are facing?  And will Japan finally rethink their officially codified stance of pacifism?    I think it's time the Japanese released thier feelings over WW II and re-arm.  We could use them, and I can't imagine them returning to the policies of Imperial Japan, not after the reforms that have firmly taken root there.  The Japanese Soldier was among the best in the world at the time, and they could be again.  Imagine Japanese intensity with American doctrine of firepower!  On second thought...maybe this is a bad idea...

      The more I think about it, the more I'm concerned about the great mass of 'non-partisans' in the country and how they are reacting to the 9/11 hearings, criticism of the war in Iraq, and general media spin on how things are going.  I've heard a few non-partisans here at work talking about things, and generally I stay out of them because it just isn't worth it to stir it up here.  Maybe I should change that policy.  In short, it seems that ANY criticism of one group leveled by another group is immediately ignored as 'partisan', despite the facts involved - unless the charges are echoed by the media, in which case they stick.  For example, the conventional wisdom here is that Bush DID know things were moving forward, and he SHOULD have done more to stop the attacks.  At the same time, any statement that the previous administration had maintained a weak policy is simply sour grapes.  Despite the fact that we had the Cole bombing (no response), the 1993 WTC bombing (no response), at least two offers to hand over Bin Laden by the Sudanese (no response) and so on.  Those FACTS don't matter.  Because the charges have been leveled by the Right, they are dismissed as 'politics'.    I'm not saying 9/11 is Clinton's fault, but I am saying that the policies pursued before 9/11 were weak and contributed to the attacks, and those policies go all the way back through the first Bush, Reagan, Carter and Ford.  Remember the Munich Olympics?  We did nothing then either.  Non-Partisans need to take the time to really understand what's going on before they simply scoff: "it's just politics".  There are FACTS here that must be examined.  In a quote I read this morning, the late Senator Moynihan said: "You're entitled to your own opinion.  You're not entitled to your own facts."

      Tampa Bay 1 Calgary 0  I have mixed feelings about Game 4 of the finals, just concluded.  Either team winning it all would be fine by me, since they are both good stories.  But there were some problems tonight.  First off, Niemenen should be put away in a dark room for what he has done - again.  This isn't the first time he's run someone in like this, and the hit was both stupid and dirty.  Good call by the refs there.  But the refs blew the first two minutes of the game.  They called a marginal penalty on Calgary, then called the roughing (which was fine), putting Tampa up on a 5-3.  Then when Tampa scored, the goal was illegal!  The Tampa player was clearly in the crease!  Inconsistency, and a lot of marginal calls through the entire game.  Still, I'm glad the series is tied.  I still can't decide which team I'd like to see win.

      I heard the tail end of this on the radio today and did a little research... Apparently this was a hit single back in 1974, and yet it is so poignant today.  a link to the audio.... http://www.waynermiller.com/mp3%20audio/Byron%20McGregor%20-%20The%20Americans%20-%201973%20hit%20version.mp3  America: The Good Neighbor.  Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:  "This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.  Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.  When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.  When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody helped.  The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars! into discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.  I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes?  Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.  You talk about American technology, and you find men on the moon! not once, but several times - and safely home again.  You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.  When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still broke.  I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.  Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of those."  Stand proud, America!

Got that? America is "less cruel than some," but "more cruel than many." We just need to apologize for our errors, bow our heads in submission, and take instruction from the majority of nations in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America who are so well qualified to give us lessons in the avoidance of cruelty.

After the fall of the Taliban, he fled to northwestern Iraq and worked with poisons for use in potential attacks, officials say.  During the summer of 2002, he underwent nasal surgery at a Baghdad hospital, officials say. They mistakenly originally thought, however, that Zarqawi had his leg amputated due to an injury.   In late 2002, officials say, Zarqawi began establishing sleeper cells in Baghdad and acquiring weapons from Iraqi intelligence officials."  Late 2002...hmmm...the war started in March of 2003.

       urlLink www.BraveWords.com   I'm linking to a heavy metal magazine....  I actually saw this on  urlLink Andrew Sullivan's web site  yesterday.  The 'journalist' is a Noam Chomsky-reading-22-year-old-canadian-socialist who tries to get some anti-American action from a member of some band I've never heard of.  I took the time to read the entire interview, and it was well worth it.  It's always fun to see 'public figures' respond in gruff language.  You don't get these types of interviews on Fox or CNN.  BW&BK: "This next question is controversial so I'm letting you know before we proceed. Some political analysts have articulated the view that what happened on September 11 was justified due to America's presence in the Middle East, specifically Saudi Arabia. Some political analysts view it as retaliation for what the US has done in the Middle East in the past. As a Canadian, I'm interested in hearing what you have to say about this view that's been put forth by analysts."  JS: "No, it wasn't justified. Not at all. And anybody who says so needs to have their fuckin' head examined."  BW&BK: "Do you think 9/11 will be viewed as the first event in the US empire's decline and fall?"  JS: "No. This is not an empire, first of all. If the United States was an empire, your country would be our 51st state."  BW&BK: "I understand."  ...  BW&BK: "So you don't see the Bush regime as being cultural imperialists? You don't see them as trying to force the American way of life on to a nation that maybe doesn't want it?"  JS: "No. If you think that's true, then why are 70 or 80 percent of the people are thrilled to have us there. Have you not seen that? And it's not a regime, by the way. You keep up that kind of language I'm going to end the interview right now."  BW&BK: "Ok. I understand."   JS: "I'm serious."  BW&BK: "I'm sorry. It's just my Canadian bias I guess."  JS: "Yeah, it is your Canadian bias. I'm sure it is."

"Nevertheless, Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power. --Al Gore, 23 September, 2002  President Bush 'has exposed Americans abroad and Americans in every town and city to a greater danger of attacks by terrorists because of his arrogance, willfulness and bungling at stirring up hornets' nests that pose no threat whatsoever to us,'  --Al Gore, 26 May 2004"

       urlLink Dennis Miller    Last night I happened to settle in the basement around 9 PM, to set up and test a scenario for ASL I will be playing on June 5th.  (It is a massive 6 board map with about 50 squads in play, so I really need to think it out.  For the WWII buffs, it is a simulation of Operation Rosselsprung, where a combined force of SS paratroopers and SS assault forces are trying to capture Tito in Yugoslavia, defending by nothing more than partisans.  It promises to be gloriously bloody).  So since I happened to be in need of entertainment, I flipped on Dennis Miller and listened as I worked.  It's been awhile since I've watched, and he is really getting into his stride.  The show is really smooth now, and Miller certainly seems fired up.  He had Bob Dole on, which I thought was amusing simply when he announced that Bob Dole was going to be on!  Dole was sharp and funny, plugging the dedication of the WW II Memorial in DC today (and I really want to make a pilgramiage to see this).  Dole is an honarable man, and while I don't think he really had what it takes to be a president, he certainly brings a dignity to the discourse, and as we found out AFTER the 96 election, he has a sense of humor (I'll never understand why he didn't simply be himself during the campaign...he's funny and warm).  Miller casually asked if he was still popping the Viagra, and Dole didn't miss a beat, saying he recommends it and it makes your hair darker, better than Grecian Formula since he could never stand the taste of it.  It got a good laugh from Miller.  The rest of the show was pretty good.  The panel had a couple of people I didn't know, as well as Yeardly Smith (Lisa Simpson).  It was a little strange to hear the voice of Lisa criticize Al Gore in pretty strong terms.  I need to make the time to watch it more, but I'm always doing something else.  Over the next week while I game the ASL scenario, I'll make a point to turn Miller on.

       urlLink NHL   We didn't really talk much about Game 1 yesterday.  Calgary is impressive, no doubt about that, but the Lightning seemed out of joint as they played.  Is that a result of them being flat, or Calgary being that good?  I didn't follow too much of the regular season, so how did Calgary end up with such a low seed when they are so good? Surprising.    I hope Tampa comes back and at least makes a series of it, but if they keep on playing like this, it might be short.  I'm always conflicted in the finals.  It's great to watch, but I hate the knowledge that the whole season ends after this.  You get hooked on always having a quality game to watch almost every night.  Then nothing but baseball.....ugh.

       urlLink Cathey Seipp   Light blogging today since I'm in meetings most of the day, but I did take a few moments to read this column.  It's worth taking the time to read through the whole thing.  Excerpt -   Now in his early 60s, Chetwynd is a longtime naturalized American citizen who was born in England and raised in Montreal. He'd remembered from Canadian regimental history that of the 4,400-odd Canadians sent to Dieppe, about 3,600 were killed. Although they knew it was basically a suicide mission, not one man failed to report for duty. Chetwynd asked one of the old soldiers in his regiment, Sgt. Gordon Betts, why.  "My generation had to figure out what we were ready to die for," Chetwynd recalled Betts telling him. "You kids don't even know what to live for."   Many years later, when Chetwynd was a successful Hollywood writer specializing in historical dramas, he told the Dieppe story during a Malibu dinner party — as a sort of tribute to the men who died there so people could sit around debating politics at Malibu dinner parties. One of the guests was a network head who asked Chetwynd to come in and pitch the story.  "So I went in," Chetwynd told me, "and someone there said, 'So these bloodthirsty generals sent these men to a certain death?'  "And I said, 'Well, they weren't bloodthirsty; they wept. But how else were we to know how Hitler could be toppled from Europe?' And she said, 'Well, who's the enemy?' I said, 'Hitler. The Nazis.' And she said, 'Oh, no, no, no. I mean, who's the real enemy?'"

'They've captured the heart of Toronto, which means they must have captured the rest of the country already,' said Peter Mansbridge, who flew in for the day to interview Flames captain and NHL superstar Jarome Iginla. 'I couldn't find a single person who could say a bad thing about Jarome,' said Mansbridge, host of CBC's evening news show, The National, as he joined hundreds of media buzzing about the cool shelter of the rink on this 30C afternoon. 'It seems he's not just a nice guy, but he goes the extra mile.' Mansbridge, who's hoping to conduct one of his newscasts in Calgary during the series, says Iginla represents everything that's good about Canada. 'He offers leadership, commitment to community and so many other things. 'Plus, he wears a visor! Now, that's a Canadian to be proud of.'"  It's infectous to read the Calgary Herald now, I couldn't imagine living in a small market team that is in the finals...

Perfectly moronic choice."  More Bill Simmons, but more importantly...  What do you guys think about what Iginla did?  I watched him do it and about fell out of my chair.

       urlLink Michael Barone: Speaking to the nation   Michael Barone is in the same league as George Will when it comes to the importance of what he says.   "But for the most part, Roosevelt did not have to deal with one problem Bush faces today. And that is that today's press works to put the worst possible face on the war. "  ....  "But they seldom seek the good news -- readily available in Iraqi and military weblogs and confirmed in polls of Iraqis -- that incomes, electricity, schools, water quality, medical care, religious freedom and security are improving in Iraq. Some reporters, as the Daily Telegraph's Toby Harnden reports from Iraq, deliberately avoid good news because they think it might help George W. Bush win re-election."  I can't emphasize enough the importance of the Web Logs from Iraq.  Almost uniformly, they say the same thing - Iraq is going well, life is improving, and our service people are excited and engaged at the task handed to them.    As Barone says - " The gains to be won by persevering in Iraq are great -- an example of decent government can change the Middle East. The losses to be suffered by not persevering are even greater: Vast gains by terrorists determined to attack everything we hold dear."

      Hockey update.  I’m starting to feel odd about posting these, since it is more of a vanity post than anything.  But then again, the whole Blog is essentially for vanity.  The game was at 9 pm last night, playing the team that we beat in the first game of the season (12-10 I think…something like that).  They showed up with a full roster, while we had three people (and one of them was the woman on our team who runs the league.  She’s a solid player, but due to gender, isn’t as fast or physical as most of the players).  We borrowed a skater from the game before ours, giving us the minimum number of people for the game.  Ever optimistic, I pointed out that we now had the advantage, since it was impossible for us to be called for too many men on the surface…one less penalty for us to be concerned about.  We ended up losing 6-4, but I was so thrilled with my own performance.  It was a Zen game for me, where the puck looked like a beach ball and everything seemed to be in slow motion.  I was making miracle glove saves on one timers, terrific stack pad slides, and in one case, batted the puck out of the air while diving across the empty net…picked it clean out of the air like I was taking batting practice.    On the down side I took a savage spear to the neck (it was accidental – a collision on a two-on-one break).  The blade of the stick barely caught my mask, but the heel did hit my neck.  The falling player ended up driving his full weight behind the stick, and for a moment I thought I was going to impersonate a dandelion under the tender care of a six year old.  Fortunately the mask took most of it.  Another inch or two…  I rarely feel so positive about a lost game, but I’m still experiencing the warm glow of satisfaction.  It is rewarding to skate the post game handshake and see a proper amount of respect and awe from the other team, as well as the conversation afterward while everyone breaks down their equipment.    It was a great night.  I’m playing again tonight for the women’s league as a stand in.  With my luck, I’ll probably give up 10.

       urlLink Captain's Quarters   Michael Berg, the father of Nick Berg, seems to be an utterly craven moral coward!  As the writer here says, you can understand a certain level of grief when a man deals with the brutal murder of his son, but this is well beyond the pale.    How about an excerpt of Michael Berg's column in the Guardian?  "People ask me why I focus on putting the blame for my son's tragic and atrocious end on the Bush administration. They ask: "Don't you blame the five men who killed him?" I have answered that I blame them no more or less than the Bush administration, but I am wrong: I am sure, knowing my son, that somewhere during their association with him these men became aware of what an extraordinary man my son was. I take comfort that when they did the awful thing they did, they weren't quite as in to it as they might have been. I am sure that they came to admire him.   I am sure that the one who wielded the knife felt Nick's breath on his hand and knew that he had a real human being there. I am sure that the others looked into my son's eyes and got at least a glimmer of what the rest of the world sees. And I am sure that these murderers, for just a brief moment, did not like what they were doing.  George Bush never looked into my son's eyes. George Bush doesn't know my son, and he is the worse for it. George Bush, though a father himself, cannot feel my pain, or that of my family, or of the world that grieves for Nick, because he is a policymaker, and he doesn't have to bear the consequences of his acts. George Bush can see neither the heart of Nick nor that of the American people, let alone that of the Iraqi people his policies are killing daily. "  The writer of this link has a much better detailed analysis, so go over there and read it all.

       urlLink Patterico's Pontifications:  Newsweek  Columnist Jonathan Alter: Bushies Are "Clowns" :   Jonathon Alter is a columnist for Newsweek and I believe MSNBC.com.  He presents himself as a 'balanced' journalist in both forums, but lately he appeared on Al Franken's show on Air America and made the following statements about Bush and the administration.  "Here are Alter's money quotes:  The level of incompetence is so staggering here, and yet there's this gap between how astonishingly incompetent - and we can go over particulars in the last year if you want to - how astonishingly incompetent they've been and the perception is still of them as solid citizens.  ... The only way you can sort of start to let the public know is to say, no, they don't know what they're doing. They're clowns."  Alter can think and say whatever he likes.  I have no problem with this.  However, I think most of us should be aware that political agendas can not be seperated from how one approaches the news.  Bias exists on both sides, and for pious journalists like Peter Jennings proclaim they have no opinion, these same people shape the news and our perception of what happens (witness the lack of good news from Iraq).    The casual voter needs to understand this bias when all they get in the way of news is the Daily Show, or CBS once a week.  I think that's why most uninformed of detached people wind up voting for the democrats...they've been shaped, and they aren't thinking much anyway.  Read more Blogs.  I think the mainstream media is in deep trouble, and the Bloggers are making serious inroads in picking up the responsibility of reporting that the media has casually tossed aside.  Right now, I'm getting more truth from the Blogs, and I'm getting stories and facts before they appear on the major sites.  And in many cases, I can spot errors that end up being corrected later on.  The Blogosphere might be the future of responsible reporting.  Oh, and I have no illusions that just because I have a Blog, I'm part of this.  This is nothing but a pale shadow of the real Blogs...

The leaders and stars showed up - Preemow, LeCavelier - and the kids gave up nothing, either.  The referees swallowed their whistles about 1/2 way through the 3rd period, but no players complained.   The overtime was SO intense.  Up and down - and no TV timeouts!  God I LOVE that!  Constant hockey.    All that orange does something weird to the cameras....or maybe it's my old, tired eyes.  This serves to reinforce what Playoff Hockey is all about.

       urlLink Press can't let abuse story go - The Washington Times: Nation/Politics - May 21, 2004 :   More abuse news.  I think the media is overplaying this, as I've said, but now it must even seem ridiculous to the casual observer.  We know the relevant points here, and wave after wave of released pictures is adding nothing to the story, unless you derive some sick satisfaction in seeing the particular methods employed.  Nothing new is really being discovered, yet the media is feeding on this as if it were a brand new story each day.    Agenda?  Sure.  Is it really so unreasonable to think that the coverage is this intense primarily because it satisfies two impulses of journalism?  Destroy Bush and discredit the military.  Can anyone doubt that the media sees this as a primary mission?  Quote- "The center has been following 'the bias problem' among broadcasters who use the abuse story to build a case against the war in Iraq and the Bush administration. As a sample, the group tracked abuse stories from April 29 through May 11 on NBC and found that the network aired 58 stories on the abuse in that period.       The MRC also found, however, that in the past year, NBC had aired only five stories on mass graves found in Iraq from the Saddam Hussein era.

       urlLink Muslims, like Jews and Christians, must own up to problems in their holy book.   :   Ishrad Manji has an interesting article on OpinionJournal.com today that sounds a little like a rather inflamed conversation occuring on this blog last week.  Read the whole thing.  "But within no time the business establishment of Mecca grew threatened--and threatening. Mohammed and his flock pulled up stakes and moved to Medina in order to protect themselves. That, goes the argument, is when the Koran's message of compassion turns to retribution. In Medina, some residents welcomed the Muslim influx, and others decidedly didn't. Among those who didn't were Medina's prominent Jewish tribes, which colluded with Mecca's pagans to assassinate Mohammed and annihilate Islam's converts. The reason they failed is that God instructed Mohammed to strike preemptively. (Evidently, the pre-emptive doctrine didn't begin with President Bush.)  This, the argument continues, is where all the vitriol in the Koran comes from. However, the argument persists, retribution isn't the spirit with which Muslims started out. They resorted to it for the purpose of self-preservation, and only temporarily. The older, 'authentic' message of Islam is the one on which Mohammed launched his mission.  ...  Moderate Muslims, like moderate Christians and Jews, shouldn't be afraid to ask: What if our holy script isn't perfect? What if it's inconsistent, even contradictory? What if it's riddled with human biases? As an illiterate trader, Prophet Mohammed relied on scribes to jot down the words he heard from God. Sometimes the Prophet himself had an agonizing go at deciphering what he heard. What's wrong with saying so?"

(uh..that was Ice Man, EBs)    :) Not to sound gay, but is that not the most infectious, joyous canadian smile in the game?!  Can anyone of us truly imagine the feeling of being 4 wins from hoisting the Cup, not to mention all the little victories along the way!?!    And what a class act by Sutter - he stood at the Sharks bench and waited till the players shook hands, then shook hands with each of the Sharks - most of whom he coached just last year.  I'll be pulling for the Flames in the finals, even over the 'Ning.    On CBC, they had Mike Vernon on Kelly Hrudy's intermission show.  It was like two buddies chatting about the good old days, only without the brews and the cursing.  Vernon was talking about a toe save he made back in 1984!   It was the '89 playoffs really, but they WERE talking about stuff from 1984, like the Scouts and the Rockies!    I think 1984 was the last time I played goalie.  We got sticks for Christmas (it was sometime in the mid 80's...) and were playing in the lot next door to our place on Mulberry.  I took a tennis ball to the eye - flush-on -  scared the shit outta me.  And by 'shit' I DO mean "the desire to stand in front of projectiles intended to pass through you like chopsticks through a wooden door" - a'la Real People or That's Incredible, whichever it was.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Bush refuses to release oil from emergency reserve :  Wow, check out the slant in this news story.   "US President George W. Bush (news - web sites) refused to release oil from an emergency reserve to lower record gasoline prices, saying it would weaken the country in its 'war on terror'. "  All in the first sentence.  -First, Bush 'refused' to release oil.  Was there an official mandate to release the oil?  Is Bush getting in the way of someone who has the authority to do this?  This is like saying "Todd refused to post to the Blog in the past hour."  -Second, the SPR release would have no significant impact on the price of gas.  Hell, even John al-Kerry said the same thing back in 2001.  The amount that could be fed back into the system is too small to have a meaningful impact.  This comes up EACH and EVERY time gas prices go up.  Clinton dipped into the SPR all the time, to little effect other than glowing editorials from the NYT. -Third, why is the war on terror in quotes?  Reuters does this all the time, placing scare quotes around words such as 'terrorist' (after all, one man's terrorist is another man's patriot, right?).    Editorialized reporting has no place in journalism.  Unfortunately, it's now the rule rather than the exception.

I wish to denounce this barbaric act and the pathetic ideology that fueled it, to disown any person from my part of the world who would justify it, and to offer my sincere condolences and sympathy to the family and countrymen of Nicholas Berg.  And for Muslims, who are definitely going to say 'this isn't the real Islam':  'When you meet the unbelievers, strike off their heads; then when you have made wide slaughter among them, carefully tie up the remaining captives.'

       urlLink Amazon.com: DVD: House of Sand and Fog (2003)   As you might have noticed by now, I have included links to whatever DVDs I currently have on hand from  urlLink Netflix .  Yeah, I have a misplaced sense of my own importance, but maybe I'll rent something you have seen or want to see, and we can talk about it.  Anyway, last night I watched House of Sand and Fog and I felt compelled to blog about it.    What a movie!  This is how films should be made!  Every person in this film is full of pain and doubt.  Each character is simply trying to do what they feel is right, and as the consequences begin spinning, you have a sense of inevitability regarding the outcome.    The characters are just so well portrayed.  Ben Kingsley has vast reserves of dignity, and he plays an exiled Iranian Colonel to perfection.  He just wants to rebuild his life and maintain the dignity of his family, while at the same time demonstrating compassion for his tormentor.  Jennifer Connelly is perfect as a whacked out, depressed woman who can't accept responsibility for her own actions, desperately in need of love for herself and from others.  The actress who plays Kingsley's wife is simply amazing, conveying a sense of compassion and dignity with nothing but broken english and facial expressions.  It is a crime she did not receive an Oscar for her work.  The entire movie is a crime, really.  It recieved a total of three nominations (Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Music).  By far, it deserved Best Picture.  I've seen 21 Grams, and I liked it, but House was a better film.  I really can't understand why House was so  urlLink snubbed .    In watching the raw pain of this film, it is obvious that no studio suit got anywhere near making 'suggestions' on how to 'improve' the bankability.  I'm thankful for that.  House pulls no punches, and if you are a thinking empathic person, it will really strike you.   This one gets the EB stamp of approval.

       urlLink CNN.com - More pictures of prison abuse found - May 19, 2004   The Abu Ghraib 'scandal' is still the darling of the media.  Who was Nick Berg?  Do you think the media is overplaying this?  Are you tired, or does your sense of outrage grow?  I really think this is going to blow up on the Bush Haters, just as the 9/11 commision turned out to be nothing more than a stage for grandstanding politicians of both parties.  The public tuned out a long time ago, which is really a shame since there could have been some value in a proper investigation of 9/11.    Abu Ghraib is the new Vietnam-cadence.  Those that hate us will use this to justify thier hate.  Those that know better will see this for what it was and move on with life.  And I think most of the great unwashed undecideds can recognize this for what it is.  As for intelligence gathering, I wonder how much we've learned from these prisoners using these tactics?  The recent chemical weapon attack foiled in Jordan might have come from some data out of Abu Ghraib.  As someone else said - the intelligence didn't come to Queen Noor in a dream.  Someone had to wring it out of a bad guy, and as a result, a lot of Jordanians are still alive.    We should consider this with a little more sensibility than simple pious outrage.

       urlLink Brent Bozell: The media on Nicholas Berg: So what? :  Brent Bozell on the media's complete willingness to ignore the Nick Berg story,  "While NBC aired 58 stories on U.S. prison abuse in the first few weeks of that story, NBC aired only five stories over 16 months on the discovery of Saddam's mass graves. Abu Ghraib holds 1,500 prisoners, a fraction of whom were abused. Saddam's graves held as many as 300,000 people, all of whom were murdered. How is Abu Ghraib 10 times more important than that?  Sadly, the distortions continued. With few exceptions, the Berg beheading was at best a two-day TV story, an obstacle to get around, a white-noise distraction from The Scandal. Berg died. The media's take: sad, but so what? That shouldn't register in public opinion. On the very night the Berg story emerged, ABC's "Nightline" couldn't spend more than a few minutes on Berg before Ted Koppel was back to soliciting John McCain to explain what horrific treatment Americans might dish out next."

       urlLink France says 35-hour week is failing   This is going to be fun to watch.  France is trying to come to grips with the consequences of its own failed social state.  They're going to have to scrap the 35 hour work week and trim jobs.    France is in for some very real problems in the future, and this is one of the reasons I worry about a future EU-USA conflict in a generation or two.  Europe as a whole is facing a declining population and a contracting standard of living as a result of thier great experiment with socialism.  While not as extreme as Russia, things are going to get much worse before they get better.  To become more competitive in the world, unemployment will increase even more, and austerity measures must be imposed on budgets, cutting back on social services while you have a population growing more dependent on the 'safety net'.    Desperate people who have grown up to believe they are entitled to a government provided standard of living can be quite violent when facing reality.  This could get ugly.

Calling the terrorists 'militants' or 'radical Islamists' presupposes the existence of moderates willing to confront the radicals. Outside of Turkey, it is very hard to find moderate clerics who will stand up to Islamist terrorists, even though the majority of their victims are Muslim. In Iraq, Muqtada al-Sadr has been murdering his religious opposition and using armed gangs to establish political rule. He appears immune to anything resembling condemnation. We know that his militia receives outside support--and where would it come from other than Syria and Iran? "

      Pet Peeves of a Goalie.  As a referee, please do me the courtesy of checking to be sure I am ready before dropping the puck to start the game, or after a goal is scored.  It only takes a second to look at each end of the rink and get a nod.  Hitting the post is nothing to get excited over.  You missed the net, you didn't beat the goalie.  Had the shot been on net, it would have been stopped.  My job description says nothing about protecting the posts.  When the other team is dancing around the boards, don't just stare at them.  Make them make the play.  They're not all Wayne Gretzky.  Most of them will screw up under pressure.  Go get 'em.  If you're on my team and standing in the slot, you better not be watching the puck.  There are enemy skaters in need of molestation.  More if I think about it....

      Referee update, day 2.  Well, that didn't last long.... First game I called a penalty and the guy went nuts.  Screaming, bitching up and down, saying to me "just where you left off from last season!",  you suck, etc....  Rightfully, I shoulda given him 10, but this kinda thing doesn't bother - I find it entertaining, actually, and he was rather creative.  Still, my adrenaline was pumping, and it made the rest of the game quite interesting....  I had to give him AND his hard-ass brother more penalties at the end of the game.  Stupidity....It confounds me that they have to be such assholes about it - they're not getting paid, they're not even getting trophies - hell, they're 'the best team' out there and they didn't even win the championship last year!   The slightest infraction from the other team - an accidental trip or whatever - and they're ready to kick the shit out of the whole team!  Inane....  Then, the second game was a blowout - the squad of kids vs the squad of central grads that've played together for 5 years or more.  On play where I was the high ref, the puck was in the crease being batted around...I'm drifting in whenthe other ref blows the whistle, so I skate in hard because the puck is under the goalie somewhere.  I go to stop (moments later it occurred to me that I may have been trying an ice stop) and slide onto my knee, hip, and ass-in that order.  HILARIOUS, as I was the only one moving at the time!    A couple of the Central grads are irredeemable asses, too.  The were blowing out the kids and one accidentally got the stick up high - didn't come close to hitting him.  He said something threatening, then on the next rush fired a ROCKET at the head of the other goalie - a stiff and talentless giant with neck and belly flesh sticking out of ill-fitting equipment - and CONTINUED to fire it as hard as he could from any angle regardless of who was in the way.  Can't call a penalty for that, though.   (I did call one last year when a jerk fired it deliberately into the other bench.)   Mark, have you ever experienced that kinda play, from either side?  If someone fires at your goalies head like that, what would you do?  Would/did YOU ever fire it like that?  These people are missing the point of the game.  Sure it's grand competition, but it's supposed to be fun - especailly Inline.  It's not supposed to be rough or eminently dangerous.  What are they REALLY angry about?  missed opportunities?  bad domestic situations?    Who poured vineger on YOUR fruity pebbles?!    Does Tibet have a national hockey team?

       urlLink Belmont Club   I doubt most of you are interested in reading this one, but if you do consider yourself a 'student' of history, particularly military history, you really should take the time to read this whole thing.  It's a fascinating examination of the growing shift away from battlefield reality when it comes to determining the 'winner' of a conflict.  Quote - During the campaign of 1940, Heinz Guderian's panzers bypassed many French formations, leaving them unfought, knowing that if their command structure were severed, the whole musclebound mass would fall to the ground headless. What the Left gradually discovered during the course of the Vietnam war was that Guderian had not been bold enough. Guderian still felt it necessary to win on the battlefield. He had not realized that it was possible to ignore the battlefield altogether because it was the enemy political structure, not his military capability, that was the true center of gravity of an entire campaign. It was General Giap during the Vietnam War who first planned a military operation entirely around its possible media effect.

       urlLink My Way - News   A few days ago, I saw a story that revealed the US was quietly topping off the Strategic Pertoleum Reserve, buying up crude.  While nothing was revealed, it suggests the US could be expecting a problem in future oil supply.  Personally, it got me thinking of the post-election strategy of Syria, Iran or even Saudi Arabia....  In the wake of that story comes this story.  John al-Kerry is predictably calling for Bush to begin releasing oil reserves to combat the 'high cost of gas'.  There's so much wrong with this I don't know where to begin.  -Why is the President responsible for gas prices? -What part of STRATEGIC RESERVE isn't understood? -Gee, maybe we should build refineries? -Or how about drilling some of our own oil? -Or how about reducing the number of gas blends from 28 to 1?  But the American people will probably want these reserves released so they can save $2 a tank.  It's so easy to be a Leftist when all you have to do is appeal to emotion.

In one of the meetings I asked them about their opinion about the government and the president they would like to have in the future, here, a man said " I'd prefer a Christian president" as a matter of fact I was shocked as I wasn't expecting to hear such a perspective in an almost exclusively Shei'at village. Here the others agreed and clarified their friends point "we mean that we don't want an Islamic or Shei'at government" "see, the SCIRI party established a library and a school to give religion classes that no one attends despite it cost the party thousands of dollars and occupied one of the towns' buildings. Take a look at the water treatment plant that the coalition established, people gather around it every morning'.

      Referee Update.  Last wednesday was my first night back on skates to referree.  I didn't fall down.  It went well, really.  I was confident, made the right calls at the right time, and projected a professional attitude that announced to the players - "No bullshit this season, boys."  I have a partner this time, too.  It's a lot easier to feel confident when the other Ref has less experience than you.  I felt more in charge, more of a mentor - more responsiblity to the job.  It's also less nerve-wracking when you have the ability to share the blame for something missed.  I was quickly reminded how tricky it can be to maintain your balance at highspeeds.  (that's something Todd don't have to worry about!) These guys are fast, too.  Most of 'em anyway.  Don still plays - (Vern's cousin Don) so does Shwanger.  Buck-who was on the first Central-winning purple-jerseyed team with me - also still plays.

      Hockey Update...almost forgot.  I think I had mentioned that due to a schedule change, we ended up with back to back games last night.  As I usually have a hard enough time with ONE game, I was certain that I would breathe my last with about 10 minutes left in game 2.  I made appropriate Final Arrangements with my wife before heading to the rink.  The first game went well, despite the predictable high score.  We won 12-11 with the winning goal coming with 21 seconds left.  We played the best team in the league so far, handing them their first loss.  Again, the speed of the players here is difficult to believe.  Despite giving up 11, I played solid and made numerous saves that felt like the old days.  I lost count of the number of 2-1, 3-1, 3-0 and outright breakaways, and I acquited myself well.  When Game 2 started, most of my guys were barely moving, especially after coming off such a close, intense game.  We were down 10-5 at the end of the first half, and as evidenced by the score, I was playing quite poorly.  The fatigue was certainly catching up with me, but I can, in good conscience, dish a small portion of blame to my teammates for failing to cover anybody in the slot.  At least 4 of the goals were back door plays, leaving me all by myself.  Things changed a little at the half when we rested, and then immediately burned our timeout for a few more minutes of rest.  The quality of play improved all the way around, bring us to a score of 15-13 with two minutes left.  Then 15-15 with 60 seconds to go.  We took the lead at 16-15 with 40 seconds left on an amazing sequence of purely satanic give and go passes.  It reminded me of the Tampa Bay goal.  The final 40 seconds was a seige, with the other team just pounding away from eight feet.  I have no idea how I stopped so many shots, but it was as if someone was standing there with a bag of pucks, throwing them at me as fast as they could.  I don't mind to admitting luck had a great deal to do with it.  So we ended up 2-0 for the day, and despite the score, I was quite pleased.  I'm certainly feeling it today, but it is a pleasant sort of ache.  The kind of pain where you know it has been good for you.  I was invited to fill in tonight for the women again, but I passed.  I'm thinking about calling the rink and agreeing to go in, but haven't decided.  Looking forward to Steve's update on how many penalties he called, and how often he avoided getting in the way.  After watching our ref dodging pucks, it occured to me the ref is the anti-goalie.

       urlLink CNN.com - Car bomb?kills Iraqi Governing Council leader - May 17, 2004   Looks like the terrorist had a good weekend, knocking off the President of the Governing Council.  I spent the weekend at my parent's house and had some interesting conversation with my father.  His position as of last week was Abu Ghraib was the end for us, and we had lost a war that he already did not agree with.  He thought we were botching it, giving me the usual CNN litany of miserable failures and so on.    This week he was of a completely different mind.  The Nick Berg execution changed it all for him.  Now, he isn't all that concerned about Abu Ghraib, and in fact thinks the 'torture' might have been a smart thing to do.  He thinks we should escalate our involvment, and be more aggressive against al-Sadr.  He also is starting to wonder if it is even possible to coexist with Islam, but I didn't go into my position there since I frankly didn't have the energy to spend an hour ranting the contents of this Blog.  After all, it was the weekend and I was supposed to be relaxing.  While my dad isn't a representative sample, I do get the impression that many reasonable undecided people are having their attitudes hardening with the Nick Berg murder.  I hope so.

       urlLink We must carry the burden of being free   The Gazette finally published my letter, and they edited it!  The hacked out a few paragraphs that I thought were particularly meaningful!  Here's the whole thing for those who didn't see it the first time.  The recent controversy over photographs of our fallen soldiers returning to the US illustrates fundamental flaws in the positions of both sides.  The Pentagon claims that they wish to protect the privacy of the families.  That is a noble sentiment, but the anonymity of a flag draped coffin is assured.  In fact, as a symbol, the image serves as a reminder of the integrity, honor and dedication expressed by each of our volunteer soldiers who place our nation above themselves and their family.  It is our responsibility to understand the consequence of what they do for us, and to respect their sacrifice.  The Pentagon’s ultimate motivation stems from the immature and cynical nature of our national media.  There is little doubt that these images will be used in an attempt to destroy our resolve to see this conflict through to the end.  The merchants of cynicism have little use for the larger ideas represented by those coffins, seeking only to discredit, undermine and cheapen the meaning of the sacrifice.  However, the media’s failing to behave as adults is not a sufficient excuse for the Pentagon to hide these images.  (Removed by Gazette) War is a brutal and nasty thing, but when a nation decides to embark on this course, it deserves the seriousness of mature adults.  If our general population lacks the stomach and resolve, then we should not place our soldiers in harm’s way.  If our people wish to abdicate our position in the world by demonstrating our unwillingness to defend our way of life, then we are not worthy of the sacrifice of these men and women.    The best way to end these images is to treat this conflict with the seriousness it requires.  We need to engage the war fully, and remove political restrictions from the calculus of combat.  The lesson of Viet Nam continues to go unlearned by the majority of people in this nation.    (removed by Gazette) John Stuart Mill said it best.  “War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.  The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling that thinks nothing is worth war is much worse.”  These images are a reminder that there are still men and women in this country who understand the burden of being free in a largely tyrannical world, and are willing to carry that burden despite the scorn with which that idea is held by certain elements in the very society they strive to protect.

       urlLink TROY / ** (R)   Ebert has a good review of the movie Troy.  I think he hits it dead on when he says that characters from Greek myth aren't supposed to be nuanced or conflicted.  I still want to see it, but from the opening previews I feared the CGI/Summer Movie feel would make for a bad experience.  I still highly recommend reading, or re-reading, the Iliad.  It shouldn't take long, and it really packs a punch for a three thousand year old piece of literature.  Sing the rage of Achilles!

      Settle in for a long post.    For the better part of three years I’ve been beating my head against the wall over the Middle East and terrorism, trying to get beyond the surface appearance and really grok the issue from the inside out.  It’s far too easy to sink into the casual racism inherent in the idea that the Arab mind is incapable of being civilized, or that they simply aren’t competent to govern themselves in peace.  I can’t accept the idea that they aren’t capable, but I can examine why it appears this way.  Fundamentally, I believe that all Men are capable of freedom and civilization.  I heartily endorse the words of George Bush when he says that Freedom is the natural yearning of Man.  The problem in the Mideast and elsewhere lies in the structure of a culture and the imposition of values that are contrary to the natural desire to be free.  Nazism, Communism, and now Islam work against Freedom, and remove options from people until they no longer believe they Freedom is a viable option.    I still stand by my statements of yesterday: Islam as it is today is not compatible with modern civilization, nor do I believe that Islam or the Arab culture is compatible with Freedom and Human Rights.  I also believe that a lot of people need to be removed from society before we figure out a way to bring peace to the region.  Nothing like this has ever been done in such a short scale, but the availability of modern technology and weapons place us under time pressure unprecedented in world history.  Past lessons are still relevant, but less so than before.  1)	The structure of Islam.  Islam is a warrior faith.  I make no moral judgment with that statement; it is simply fact.  Mohamed was at war with the dominant Arabian pagan faiths of the time, striving to seize control of the region.  He wrote the Koran while running from his enemies, fighting them, and eventually winning a brutal, bloody war.  The Koran was a sequence of proclamations from Mohamed to his army.  He sold them the Paradise of Allah in exchange for absolute loyalty to his cause.  You’ve heard before that Islam means “Peace through submission to the Will of Allah”, convenient for Mohamed as the voice of Allah.  I’ve read large chunks of the Koran, and you can’t deny the violence contained within those pages.  As a field manual for an army surviving in a brutal era, I can’t quarrel with it. 	As an idea, Islam has been remarkably successful, rising from an idea to a major religion and seizing control of a large chunk of the known world in a few centuries.  It is as powerful as Christianity in its ability to convert and control.  However, where Christianity found a way to outgrow the horror of medieval values, Islam has changed little since its early days.  It is still a faith of the persecuted minority eager to convert the world by the sword.  2)	Islam as a culture Islam as the center hub of culture has manifestly failed to produce a modern society anywhere in the world.  There are two notable exceptions, and both help illustrate my point.   Turkey is more European than Islamic, due largely to the secularization of Islamic life in their society.  The Turks have removed control of the education system from Islamic control, and largely isolated the Imans from political life.  In Turkey, being a Muslim is a personal choice, existing on the outside of public life.  As a result, Turkey is somewhat prosperous, stable, and have nearly earned membership in the EU. Saudi Arabia, and the various small states surrounding it, have their oil wealth to thank for any sense of a modern culture.  Western influence and interest in that oil has forced them to import and accept exposure to western values, bringing with it a veneer of modern life.  Beyond this thin layer of civilization, Saudi Arabia still clings to Wahabi Islam; one of the most virulent strains of Islam.  Beneath the seeming modern culture, the old ways still fester, and Saudi Arabia is one large bomb away from reverting to 1979 Iran.  The role of Islam as the center of Saudi life plays a large role in the fact that most of the 9/11 culprits were Saudi, Usama Bin Laden is a Saudi, and Saudi organizations continue to funnel millions of dollars to Islamic terror groups all over the world.    3)	Middle East violence.  Every Middle Eastern terror organization has Allah and Islam at the core.  I don’t think that can be denied.  They recruit from the mosque community, they draw upon the cultural and religious influence of militant imams, and they prey upon worshiper’s belief that Allah rewards the faithful soldier in his cause, returning to the themes of Mohamed as he battled for control of his region against the pagan infidels.  Islam is a wonderful tool to raise armies and recruit fanaticism.  It seems to be inherent in its structure. Couple this with the theocratic control over the power of the state, and you have serious problems.   In the Middle East, Islam is the center of life.  Being a secular Muslim means trying very hard to convince everyone around you that you are a fanatic, while trying to avoid torture or murder.  The police power of the state coupled with theocratic fanaticism means you keep your head down and try to stay alive.  In such an environment, there is little room for a Martin Luther, or other figure, to preach reform.  Without an external influence to promote a stable and safe environment, Islamic reform is a dead issue.  This brings me to my solution.  It is an extension of what I mean when I say that Islam, as it is today, must die, and practitioners of Islam as it is understood today must be removed from society if they do not abandon their beliefs.  The key to Islam’s compatibility with the modern world lies in the secularization and reform of the Islamic message.  However it is done, Islam’s message, as a warrior faith practiced by an oppressed minority, must be changed.  Islam must be removed as the center of life in the Middle East.  It must be disentangled from government, and de-emphasized as the sole reason for living.  My initial ideas on how to do this are as follows: 1)	Secularization. a.	Some sort of council of respected and credible Islamic scholars must come together under our protection and reform the message of Mohamed.  The Koran needs to be examined and explained, combating the incendiary preaching of theocratic imams.  This council must bring Islam into the modern age by pruning what no longer applies.  The faith must be severed from its roots as a warrior religion.  Essentially, they need a Red Letter King George W. Version of the Koran.  It won’t be accepted immediately, but it is vitally needed as a starting point. b.	Control of the Islamic Message.  The new version of Islam must be preached to the masses.  The old version of Islam needs to be removed from circulation.  We need to make it clear: if you preach death, you don’t survive to give a second sermon.  If you, as a worshiper, try to protect an Imam, you share his fate.  If it brings an uprising, so be it.  We cannot tolerate a faith that continues to preach death and hatred, under any circumstances.   If you preach the New Islam, then not only do you benefit from our protection, you get your own satellite network.  Will people listen?  Perhaps.  I believe a message of hope and peace will always win over a message of despair and death.  Even in poverty, hope always wins.  A New Islamic faith can take root, given enough time, and the suppression of competition. c.	As I just touched upon, the suppression of Old Islam must be undertaken without flinching.  You MUST prune it out and replace it with the new message.  You do that by protecting the new Imams, giving them a forum, and demonstrating that peace begets progress.  The old ways of Fatwa and Jihad must be stamped out with extreme prejudice.  Muslims must be presented a choice. d.	Finally, we must work to secularize both Old Islam and New Islam.  We need to build equivalents to those big freakin’ Baptists Churches I saw all over Atlanta, seating thousands.  We need to make worship more of a social event than a literal interaction with Allah.  We need to offer incentives in a gross, base, and commercial American style: if you belong to this church, you get a leg up on jobs and contracts.  You get perks.  You get the secret handshake that gets you discounts.  Whatever.  Essentially, we need to turn the Mosque into a club.  This meshes with something I’m going to get to in a moment, so suspend judgment on this for a moment.  The second part of this reform is:  2)	Industrialization a.	Iraq has too much idle labor at the moment.  They are a highly educated people, but it’s going to take too long to ramp up the types of industry that can take advantage of their skills.  Therefore, we need to immediately progress to sweatshops.  There is no reason Iraq shouldn’t be making our clothes, shoes and other low cost items that can be manufactured immediately.  Private capital will not flow into Iraq right now with all the trouble, so the American government needs to underwrite these ventures.  Begin employing the teeming mass.  Give them something to do, and give them a salary while they produce goods.  This will gradually raise the standard of living, and eventually, more sophisticated industries will rise up and access the Iraqi skill set.   b.	Further industrialization enhances the secularization of the society.  As people gain employment, they begin to accumulate products and disposable income.  Life becomes a little more enjoyable.  A consuming middle class is a beacon of hope for those mired in poverty, especially if that middle class is grounded in the new social club of New Islam.  Join the New Islamic Mosque, accept the message of peace and hope, and gain access to middle class benefactors that will give you contacts to improve your life.  Attend an underground Old Islamic mosque and find yourself frozen out of access to jobs.  Yeah, it’s an un-American concept, but I think it is necessary for the type of change that is needed. Consumerism brings peace.  It’s hard to imagine a guy with a nice house, good job, an education for his kids, and luxury items like televisions and refrigerators going off and blowing up a bus.  It’s about as likely as an American wanting to die for Catholicism.  Undermining the central role of Islam, either New or Old, is essential to making this work.  Here in the US, spontaneously telling someone you are a Christian usually provokes a strained moment where everyone hopes the conversation doesn’t go into your personal relationship with Christ.  We need the same situation in Islamic countries.  Your relationship with Allah is your business, and should remain part of your private life.  I think the steps outlined above could get us there someday, perhaps in a generation. Reform proliferates through example.  If this works, and a free, happy, prosperous Iraq emerges with New Islam at it’s core, other Islamic states will have to cope with their people asking – “WTF?”  Avalanches start with pebbles.  I’m out of gas here.  I’m sure there are many things I missed that will come to me in a moment, and maybe those things will show up in the comment section.  Of course this isn’t perfect, or fully detailed, but I believe the principle is sound.  No one has ever had to confront a virulent religion in such a short span of time.  History is clear that you can’t stamp out a faith, but it is possible to replace it through alternatives.  Both Islam and Christianity have been successful in doing this in the past, over a long span of time.  We don’t have the luxury, so our efforts must be direct and focused.  This is what I mean when I say Islam must die, as well as those that refuse to turn away from Seventh Century values.  We have to address this.  Ideally, Islam itself would reform, but without the interference of the West, this change won’t occur fast enough to avoid the coming holocaust of nuclear Islamic Republics.  I see no other way.

       urlLink 630 WMAL   WARNING!  This is the video of Nick Berg being slaughtered.  I spent a lot of time last night trying to decide if I should watch it.  Finally, I decided I had to confront Evil.  I had to see what they did, and have my rage confirmed.  I can't put words to what I've seen.  It's like a wordless scream of rage and hatred boiling out of me.  Nick Berg screamed as they sawed at his neck.  It goes on and on, all the while these animals are chanting Allahu Akbar over and over again.  It is like staring into hell.  Where is this God that is so great?  This is Evil.  There is nothing more to say when describing it.    It confirms my disgust at a culture and religion that can promote this.  What sort of culture mires itself in the seventh century?  Islam delenda est.    Marcus Cato in the Third Punic war set out a simple concept.  "Carthago delenda est."  Carthage must be destroyed.  The Romans razed it to the ground, killed every man, and sold every woman and child into slavery.  They salted the ground and eradicated all traces of Carthage.  Rome was never bothered by them again.  Islam delenda est.  Watch the video, and tell me how we can coexist with Islam.  Explain to me how this is morally equivalent to Abu Ghraib.  Explain to me why I shouldn't beat someone senseless when they say Nick Berg deserved this?  There isn't much more to say that will be coherent in my current state.  I believe this should be aired on TV, at least once.  We should all confront this.  We should all understand what we are facing in the world.

       urlLink IRAQ THE MODEL :   A very long post from Ali at Iraq the Model.  Just when I was getting depressed, I read through this and found a little hope.  "My young cousin is a religious Sunni who goes to the mosque and listens to the cleric there every Friday and believes whatever he says, as he's still young. My uncle always teased his son about this but never prohibited him from doing that. We were talking about different stuff; the kids needs, clerics, Americans and the increase in the average income of most Iraqis. My uncle had some unusual sense of humor that didn't fit quite well in his somewhat religious family. He winked at me and turned to his son and asked him 'What do you think of the Americans?' His son answered, 'They are occupiers'. 'So you think we should fight them?' his father asked. Ibrahim said 'No, but I don't like them'. My uncle said, pretending to change the subject 'Do you like your new computer that no one shares with you?' 'Yes of course dad'. 'Ok, are you satisfied with the satellite dish receiver we have or do you need a better one?' 'This one is fine but I heard there's a better one that gets more channels' 'ok I'll get you that next week'. Then he said, 'Is there anything else you'd like to have son?' 'No dad I have all that I need'. 'Ok but how about a car?' Ibrahim was astounded and said 'Really? a..a CAR.. for me!?'. 'Of course for you! I'm too old to drive now and my eyes are not that well and you are the older son. So whom else would it be for!?' 'Oh, dad that will be great! When will that happen?' 'Just finish you're exams and you'll have it'. 'I will dad'. 'Are you happy now son?' 'Yes dad, sure I am!' 'Then why do you hate the Americans you son of a b***h!? I couldn�t get you a bicycle a year ago, I could hardly feed you and your brothers and sisters. You didn't know what an apple or a banana tasted like, I couldn't buy you a damned Pepsi bottle except in occasions, and now you can have all that you wish, and a car of your own!

Quote -  In an interview published Wednesday in the Rome daily La Repubblica, Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo described the abuses as "a tragic episode in the relationship with Islam" and said the scandal would fuel hatred for the West and for Christianity.   "The torture? A more serious blow to the United States than Sept. 11. Except that the blow was not inflicted by terrorists but by Americans against themselves," Lajolo was quoted as saying in La Repubblica.   Back to me - "A tragic episode in the relationship with Islam"?????  How about chopping off the head of a 26 year old?  How about chopping off the head of a newspaper reporter?  Burning western contractors and hanging the bodies while the crowd cheered?  Blowing up Spanish trains?  WTC...twice?  Not to mention the myriad assortment of hijackings, suicide bombings and outright murder of anyone not a Muslim?  Where the hell does the Vatican get off with this?  I'm am so sick to death of the moral equivalence the rest of the world wallows in over Islam.  I am sick of the apologies, of blaming the west, of putting the burden of coexistence upon the civilized world while indulging in the casual racism of excusing the Arabs for behaving like animals.

       urlLink Netflix: 25th Hour    .   I watched this last night on a DVD rental from  urlLink Netflix .  I'm a big fan of Ed Norton, from films such as Fight Club, Primal Fear, The Score, The Italian Job and others.  So despite this being a Spike Lee movie, I decided to give it a go.  I was entranced by this film.  It was art.  The use of the camera, the power of the soundtrack, and the near hypnotic quality of one particular voice over at the end was just masterful.  This was an Oscar quality film, and I'm surprised it wasn't recognized.  According to  urlLink BoxOffice Mojo  the film did a measly $23 million on a $5 million budget.  Sure, it made money, but it should have had a wider viewing.  This is not a film with a real plot in the regular sense.  It is a one night examination of the moral structure of three friends, a father and a girlfriend as they try to cope with the fact that Norton's character will be reporting to prison in the morning for a seven year stretch after being busted for heroin dealing.  The underlying commonality of each character revolves around their lip service to rules.  Each seems to think that rules exist, but when push comes to shove, they can break them without being all that concerned.    It's a long movie, clocking in at over two hours, and it might seem slow at times, but like many good movies, the real action is in what is NOT said.  The interest lies in watching the characters hesitate, clearly choosing their path, yet seeing an acknowledgement that this isn't good...but I'm going to do it anyway.  The movie plays over the backdrop of the World Trade Center, after the collapse.  In one scene, Barry Pepper's bond trader character is in his apartment, with a direct overview of the Crater.  He comments that they could bring down as many buildings as they want, but he isn't moving - he worked hard for this place, and he isn't going to be inconvenienced on the account of others.  His entire attitude suggests that the Crater, for him, is nothing more than a nuisance, devoid of any meaning outside of himself.  I highly recommend the film.  Pay attention to the music and how it sets the tone.  I'm not ready to sample other Spike Lee films, but he certainly impressed me with this one.

      The beheading of Nick Berg.  Can you guys help me out today?  I spent a block of time last night searching for some prominent Muslim leader condemning the murder of Nick Berg.  I surfed some Islamic boards and found nothing at all.  If you run into something, let me know.  Same for our EU friends, who were so worked into a frenzy over Abu Ghairb.  If you see some genuine outrage over Berg, let me know.  As for our friends at the DU, they spent the afternoon speculating that Berg was really murdered by the CIA or some other group at the behest of Bush/Cheney.  Various reasons were given: he knew something about the abuse in Abu Ghraib, Bush had it done to change the subject, or Berg was cutting in on Halliburton contracts.  The argument was quite genuine - little hint of sarcasm.  I know you guys get annoyed when I post DU links, but if you want this one, let me know and I'll dig it up today.

      A few moments of pathetic rumination....  I'm finding it difficult to visit book stores lately.  Over vacation, I was in several stores, loitering around and trying to soak up the atmosphere.  However, instead of the warm feeling of peace I normally associate in such a setting, I began to experience an itching agitation, driving me from the store as one would flee a creaky 'haunted' house in the middle of the night.    In standing in front of the Science Fiction shelves, I am struck by the feeling that I am standing in front of a shadowy portal, and on the other side, the real me is gazing back, ruminating on a life stuck in an 8-5 job as one of many possible pasts, thankfully avoided through the realization of my dream of being a successful writer.  I feel like the apparition, and the idea on the other side of this vision is more real than me.  I am seized with an intolerable urge to flee, to turn away from the obviousness of my unhappiness.  The strength of this feeling is beyond anything I've ever experienced, and I think it stems from the fact I've essentially given up on my novel, at least over the past few months.  I think about it daily, and I still feel good about the potential, but I'm having trouble getting back to it.    So these feelings are part of myself, angry over this abandonment of what I see as my vocational destiny and purpose.    Gotta get off my rear and get on with what I want to do.  Same old story, and I'm sure most of you are sick of hearing me whine about it.    On with it already....

       urlLink One Hand Clapping :  Tom Brokaw has the audacity to impart the Leftist lies on the Iraqi head of state in a lecturing tone.     Brokaw: I know that you and others like you are grateful for the liberation of Iraq. But can't you understand why many Americans feel that so many young men and women have died here for purposes other than protecting the United States?  Allawi: We know that this is an extension to what has happened in New York. And - the war have been taken out to Iraq by the same terrorists. Saddam was a potential friend and partner and natural ally of terrorism.  Brokaw: Prime minister, I'm surprised that you would make the connection between 9/11 and the war in Iraq. The 9/11 commission in America says there is no evidence of a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein and those terrorists of al-Qaida.  Allawi: No. I believe very strongly that Saddam had relations with al-Qaida. And these relations started in Sudan. ..."   Maybe Tom should have taken the time to actually read the 9/11 commission report.     With al Qaeda as its foundation, Bin Ladin sought to build a broader Islamic army that also included terrorist groups from Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Oman, Tunisia, Jordan,   Iraq,   Lebanon, Morocco, Somalia and Eritrea. Not all groups from these states agreed to join,  but at least one from each did.  With a multinational council intended to promote  common gooals, coordinate targeting and authorize asset sharing for terrorist operations,  this Islamic force represented a new level of collaboration among diverse terrorist groups.   Why does this lie that the 9/11 Commission found no link persist in the media in the face of numerous statements in the report that al-Qaeda and Saddam WERE cooperating.  They had not yet launched an attack on the US, but they were in the process of sharing resources and capabilities.  That is clearly in the report.  The Left seems to be hung up again on the lack of connection between 9/11 and Saddam.    Does the standard of defending ourselves still require us to accept the first blow from our enemy?  Were we to wait until Saddam and al-Qaeda got their act together and killed a few thousand Americans before the Iraqi was was justified?  The Left still seems to want to treat Terror as a law enforcement problem, confined to waiting for a crime before we can take action.  Can we afford this?

"'Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you,' Sen. Clinton said. 'We're saying that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.'

      For those of you who think that Bush manufactured the Iraqi War, or if you have friends that think so, could you answer a question for me?  Can you list all the benefits Bush will reap over the war in terms of financial gain, political gain, or personal satisfaction?  I'd be interested in hearing exactly how this war has been a good thing for Bush or Blair.

"'I send my congratulations to all Iraqis and every Iraqi home,' a woman who identified herself as Um Yassin gushed, her voice choked with emotion. 'I want to tell Dr. Allawi to be bold, to be strong. We need him to build up the army because we need them at a time like this.'   Her message was echoed by dozens on the day Prime Minister Allawi was given a letter transferring sovereignty back to the citizens of Iraq after about 14 months of coalition administration.   But in the midst of adulation for the new government, callers urged that all must be vigilant for insurgents seeking to sow more chaos in a country plagued by violence since Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)'s regime was toppled.   'I send all the Iraqi people my blessings,' said Ali, a caller from Baghdad. 'But I warn these terrorists, all the Iraqis will rise up and strike them with steel.' "   Yeah, they sound like an oppressed people who aren't capable of being free, right Mr. Kerry?

      More hostages, more killing to come....  Over vacation, the animals slaughtered the South Korean hostage, and it appears last night they murdered a US soldier with a bullet to the back of the head.  As of right now, they have a Pakistani, three Turks and a US Marine in custody and are threatening to behead them.  Putting aside my blind rage for the moment, I'm puzzled by this new collection of hostages.  If you recall a few weeks ago during the Saudi hostage siege, the terrorists made a point of releasing all muslim hostages unharmed.  They've also taken great pains to paint this conflict as a religious war against the infidels.  While it isn't unusual for muslims to murder muslims (take a look at Palestinian vigilente actions against anyone who tries to find a peaceful solution with Israel), it is unusual in the ongoing struggle in Iraq.  Surely they have access to non-Muslim hostage candidates.  They managed to snag a US Marine after all, but what are the odds they randomly get a Muslim Marine?    Are they targeting a new audience?  Are they growing more desperate?  Nick Berg and Paul Johnson got them nowhere, and it looks like South Korea isn't going away.  Is this a message to the Iraqi people that being a Muslim will no longer protect you?    The five men are certainly doomed, and it still troubles me to see little outrage in the Muslim world.  It will be telling if the death of Muslim men finally generates some reaction.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Smiling Bush quietly shares Iraq handover glee with Blair   While the Iraqi Sovereignty hand-off is symbolic in many ways, it still has a great deal of meaning to the real world.  It's obvious that the bad guys over there were going to continue murdering, beheading and blowing things up as we approached the established date of June 30th.  Anything that happens from here on is an unmistakable attack against the Iraqi people, despite whatever al-Qaeda might claim.  In reading some of the Iraqi Blogs today, like  urlLink Iraq the Model , the Iraqis are greeting this as more than just a symbol.     It’s a great day for all the freedom lovers. No doubt is left now that we’re winning while the forces of darkness and evil are losing a key round in this war.  With great delight we received th news. this is the right and important step to build the free Iraq and It’s a painful strike for terrorism and its allies. They really missed this surprising and brilliant timing. And I guess they’re deeply shocked right now. their luck couldn’t help them to scar this glorious day with a crime of theirs. .... It’s hard to appreciate the efforts of all those who helped us to get our freedom and rebuild our country. We will never forget them. We will keep them in our hearts. God bless Iraq and her people. God bless America and her people.  God bless all the coalition forces who supported operation Iraqi freedom. May God bless the souls of all those who sacrificed their lives to free Iraq.   It's important, even as a symbol.  As I heard on Fox today, an American general said that our exit strategy was training an Iraqi police and military to secure their freedom.  This is a good step in that direction.  With the Iraqis now running their own courts and having a little more freedom with thier police, the bad guys have to worry about harsher consequences than Abu Ghraib in their future.  The Iraqis aren't going to be as restrained when it comes to questioning their suspects.  The reaction from the Left is funny and predictable.  First, we would 'never' establish a viable Iraqi Government, and now we have.  The handover was taking too long, and now doing it early is evidence of 'chaos and confusion'.  The goalposts of success keep moving.  History will judge, and I'm comfortable in hearing the truth in twenty years.  When I saw Bush shake Blairs hand, both with a big grin, I shared in their moment of happiness.  We did what we promised to do, and while it isn't over by a long shot, we are meeting our obligations and doing the right thing.  Even if it isn't known or appreciated today.  Remember the adage - character is doing the right thing even if no one knows or appreciates it.  Both Bush and Blair have suffered massive electoral damage in pursuing the right course of action.  Both might lose office for it, but both men understand that the office is an implement to be used to further just causes.  If they lose, then at least they accomplished something meaningful.

      On vacationing in Cleveland….  My wife and I spent a few days in Cleveland, Ohio after leaving our daughter with my parents in Toledo.  We decided we needed a bit of a break, and since Wednesday was our ten year anniversary, it seemed as good a time as any to get away for awhile.  You might be wondering why we chose Cleveland, land of the Burning River, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the ignoble Browns.    I wondered that as well, but then I recalled that my brother lives there, so we had the added bonus of being able to visit him, as well as get some decent tips about what to do in town.  Since our time was limited, we really didn’t do a whole lot, at least not the sort of whirling tour you would expect from a typical vacation.  Despite the relatively sedate time, I thought it was worth noting a few things that I found amusing.  We visited the  urlLink USS Cod  moored in downtown Cleveland.  The Cod is a WW II submarine that saw seven tours in the Pacific, with a fairly remarkable battle record.  The boat is  urlLink moored  at the waterfront, with easy parking and access.  As a WW II historical nut, I really looked forward to this.  And at only $6, it’s a real bargain.    The tour is self guided, and since it was a weekday early in the morning, Diane and I practically had the boat to ourselves.  The condition of the tour is what makes it so interesting.  The boat has not been altered to accommodate tourists.  Entry is gained through the forward hatch, climbing in through a cramped ‘airlock’, then down through the hatch on a thin metal ladder.  The opening is so tight, I had to force my shoulders through.  Once I left the ladder below decks, I had to stoop slightly to get enough headroom to move around in the  urlLink forward torpedo room.     I won’t bore you with the blow by blow details of each compartment, but if you want to view some quicktime movies, click  urlLink here.   Suffice to say that the crowding on the boat is unimaginable.  I didn’t bring a camera since I wasn’t sure it was permitted, but after being inside the boat, I realized it wouldn’t have mattered.  I wouldn’t be able to get a coherent picture, since the subject of any picture would be too close to achieve proper focus.  I tried to imagine what these guys experienced as I shuffled along in this tiny little boat, bumping my head, knees and elbows with almost any movement.  90 men lived in a space unfit for half that number, and fought a war while doing so.    I wonder how they got around the boat with their enormous testicles in the way.  If you are ever in the Cleveland area, take an hour and go see the Cod.  You won’t regret it.  Next stop was  urlLink The Cleveland Museum of Art.   There were two primary reasons to go to the museum – 1) it isn’t something we usually do, and 2) it was free.  I put aside my entire ‘pay as you go philosophy’ for the moment and knowingly leeched from the taxpayer to go stare at  objects du’art  for a few hours.  I wasn’t really sure what we were getting in to here, but it turned out to be an enjoyable time.  The museum self guided tour started us out in the lower level, full of art from ancient Asia and India.  There’s something about antiquity that draws me in, and I’m willing to stare at about anything if you tell me it is four or five thousand years old.  The museum had no problems providing suitable moments where I could witness the creaking bones of time.  The most remarkable thing I saw was a five thousand year old clay pot, delicate and shapely, adorned with a spiral glaze pattern that looked quite modern.  I tried to imagine the circumstances that allowed it to survive 50 centuries without any significant damage.  I’m surprised some drunken Asiatic potentate hadn’t smashed it over the head of a clumsy slave, shortly before having him impaled for spilling tea.    We moved on through a vast collection of stone Buddhas in various states of decay.  Arranged properly, they would make a good Paleolithic animation of the ravages of leprosy, if one walked along quickly.  After the fifth statue, my respectful pauses to soak up the age and craftsmanship of each work degenerated to bare glances with a murmer – “Bhudda, Bhudda, Bhudda, Vishnu, Vishnu, yeah, okay…”  I think art appreciation requires small doses to be effective.  Next came various displays of Japanese art, running up until the Meiji era.  I’ve always loved Japanese art, especially the brush paintings, which are really designated as a Chinese style.  Whatever.  There’s something about Japan that has always interested me.  I appreciate how their culture values subtlety and understatement.  At least until they tried to grab the Pacific and we blew them to hell.  But we gave them Quality Control in exchange, and they turned out just fine.  There was one particular piece there that caught my imagination.  Upon entering the gallery, I was confronted with this massive  urlLink scroll painting  of a man who appeared to be in complete agony, yet with a dignified expression on his contorted face.  I also noted the proportions of the subject, thinking they looked very odd.  It turned out he suffered from gigantism, and stood over seven feet tall.  He was a samurai who turned to Sumo when he fell upon hard times.  As an added touch, the subject had placed his hand print on the canvas, just visible in the picture.  I can’t exactly explain the reason, but this portrait still sticks with me.  After this, the highlight of the museum, at least for me, was the Armor Court (a massive collection of European armor and arms dating from the 1200s through the 1600s), and the gallery of Baroque Art.  There’s just something about European art from this era, when they painted real people and real events as they imagined them appearing.  It is photo-journalism of the day, albeit at a much slower pace.  I could easily spend quite a few hours wandering in a place like this, feasting on the radiance of  urlLink this , or the transience of  urlLink this .    The gallery of modern art drove away any lingering desire to press on through my fatigue or hunger at this point.  I stared at a  urlLink Jackson Pollack  for a few moments, trying to understand what people see in the swirling mass of dribs and drabs.  With any respect that might be due Mr. Pollack, I remain an ignorant savage.  I had much the similar experience with works such as  urlLink this large piece of graph paper , or  urlLink this...whatever .  One of the funnier observations was the caption that accompanied these  urlLink squares .   ” Largely a self-taught painter, Mark Rothko stopped painting recognizable objects in 1940 because he wanted to "create a new language of painting" that made no reference to the kinds of things people were used to seeing in pictures.   May I translate?  Mr. Rothko is a talentless hack who disguises his inability to paint with an unbridled pretentiousness.  Modern art gives art a bad name, and we should identify it for what it is.  Famished from a long day of submarine exploration and a properly snooty art experience, we decided to go have an early dinner/late lunch at the Cheesecake Factory.  If you have not yet dined at the Cheesecake Factory, I strongly recommend you take the time to do so.  The food is really quite remarkable, and the portion sizes are simply ridiculous.  When our waitress brought our entrees to our table, I was immediately thankful that I had ordered a lunch portion.  While working my way through the first ten percent of my plate, I quickly grew weary of the fork-to-mouth action, and lost myself in the idea of opening up my own chain of restaurants with similar portion sizes.  I would be honest about it, and call it  Glut .  Then I considered that name too obvious, wondering if a properly umlauted name such as  Gl&#252t  might give it that touch of Euroness to make it acceptable to the upscale coast dwellers.  I fantasized about properly Germanic employees with an appropriate Teutonic dourness, operating with Prussian efficiency.  I considered the  Lebensraum  menu option, where you would get your entree along with all adjacent items.  The fantasy quickly fell apart when I contemplated the viability of German cuisine, but it was still a good image.  After I consumed an insignificant portion of my meal, it was time to consider desert.  After all, the name of the restaurant is the Cheesecake Factory.  Duh.  I had looked forward to this $7 slice of cheesecake for many days, and I wasn’t going to let a little thing like an entrée that could feed thirty get in the way.  I selected the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Cheesecake.  I’m sure many of you have had cheesecake that you might consider the equal of the cheesecake found in this blessed establishment, so I must embark on a deeper explanation of what this particular cheesecake really means to Western Civilization.  Imagine a Diabolic Machine that can take several dozen ordinary cheesecakes and condense them down to one concentrated slice of pure Experience.  This is a slice of cheesecake that diabetics speak about in hushed tones of awe.  Overweight people within three miles find themselves leaning in the direction of the restaurant, caught up in an inexplicable urge to take a few steps closer.  Small children may not be exposed to the cheesecake.  I believe that specially plated forks might be appropriate utensils.  I consumed half of my cheesecake slice and promptly forgot most of what happened afterwards.  There are fleeting memories of feverish hallucinations involving sugar, Dr. Atkins and the inverted cross.    All in all, I have to say it was a good day.

      I have some personal posts to go through, so for you hard-core political types, you may want to skip along.  I've been away long enough that I thought I should register some thoughts here.  For starters, my hockey season is now over.  My first season at SoccerZone, and I managed to reach the semi-finals.  We rushed back from Ohio on Sunday so I could make the 4 PM start time, only to see us go down in ignomious defeat.  Unfortunately, our team only dressed 4 skaters plus me in the goal, while the other side had a full roster of 8 skaters.  At the end of the first half, we were up 9-4.  We ended up losing 13-9, with the last three goals coming in the final 90 seconds.  They just wore us down to nothing and we couldn't keep up with the fresh legs.  Even so, I had a good time with the game, and played fairly well despite the score.  Next season starts in two weeks, and I'll be on the same team.  It was nice that they asked my to come back and wanted to retain me.  There's nothing like praise from one's peers, so I took it in the spirit with which it was intended.

       My Quest  --  This is a two-fold quest, with the ultimate outcome being the completion of the quest and the hopeful effect (affect?) it will have on me.  With all the hub-bub over the latest Moore flick, and some disturbing "You MUST see this" emails from some close friends, I have stumbled upon a new mantra for myself.  "I refuse to be spun."  So, I need everyone's help, I am on the look-out for Spin-free information.  Any ideas?  My issue is that I rail against the people who watch the Moore film and come out "spun".  It's a play on their own ignorance and they are too ignorant to understand it.  But then I realized, where are my beliefs rooted?  Is it because I myself have been spun (maybe even from the likes Todd himself, my main source of political information?)  I find myself in heated discussions re-hashing Todd's emails, not my own thoughts.    So I am on the look-out, along with Steve, for my  Own Opinion .  No more ignoring not having it.  Of course, I may have to give up this blog, and any hold on reality since it is impossible to be "spin-free".  So, let me amend my quest, I want  to be a regular reader of "extreme spin" news on both sides.  Maybe they will cancel each other out.  Ultimately, I would love to have a list of sites that will provide me with extreme spin news and some sites that are relatively spin-less.  I am going to start to gather this list and implement the plan as soon as possible.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Scientist Sees Space Elevator in 15 Years   This is one of the things I want to see happen beofre I die. We must explore and utilize space. And the United States must lead the way if such exploration is to benefit mankind. Whatever nation harvests the vast bounty of the cosmos fisrt will reap a bounty so great it cannot be overcome. This is like the great voyages of discovery of Columbus, Magellan, Cook and others. Rather, the elevator is a tool as important as the compass rose. With it, we can build space vehicles with no need for non-space flight. Costs will go down and utility will rise.  I ask myself how anyone can begrudge the paltry $10 billion this project is estimated to cost? This needs to be done, and the sooner the better.

Barham Salih, a prominent leader from Kurdish northern Iraq, made his plea June 19 to American reporters traveling in Iraq with Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz.   "I hope you from the American press will be able to tell people back home … that (through) this mission you are giving an entire nation an opportunity to be rid of their challenges," he said.   "These soldiers are helping renovate schools and so on, and very, very little of that is reported," Salih continued. "We have to be grateful to those young men and women who have come from afar, sacrificing their lives to defend our security and our freedom."   He said context is important, and many American papers don't put things in the proper context. For instance, he said, "Many of the op-ed writers before the war predicted that Kirkuk would become the scene of the most vicious civil war," he said, referring to the northern Iraqi city that has been the site of problems between Kurds and Arabs.   "There are tensions in Kirkuk," he said, "but no civil war."   New Iraqi President Ghazi al-Yawer explained his belief that 90 percent of what's happening in Iraq is good news, and 10 percent in bad. "The media is magnifying the 10 percent, ignoring the 90 percent," Yawer said.   He said the scandal surrounding detainee abuses at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison is a perfect example. The issue is clearer to people like him who have lived in the United States and understand American values, he said.   "I know this is outrageous to the American public (and) to the American administration as much as it is outrageous to the Iraqis," Yawer said.   But, he added, regular Iraqis "have been breastfed hatred to the United States and Great Britain for 45 years."   Yawer said he and other Iraqi leaders are working to acquaint the Iraqi people "with the real values of the American Bill of Rights and other great things you have in your constitution."

       urlLink CNN.com - Al Qaeda militants say�they were helped by Saudi forces - Jun 21, 2004   This ties in with my earlier post about Saudi Arabia.  Sure, there's a chance the AQ guys could be lying about this, but would you be surprised if the Saudi's are rendering aid?  When we talk about 'our friend the Saudi's', we are talking about the Royal Family, not the nation as a whole.  Much as it used to be 'our friends, the Iranians' back when the Shah was in power.  Yeah, it's ugly, and certainly lacks the idealism that Americans seem to prefer, but the reality is a little darker than we want to believe.  The royal family is useful to keep the Saudi's in line and keep the oil flowing.  That's about it.  We've managed to ignore the Wahhabi problem for decades, but as the nature of the War on Terror evolves, we're going to have to deal with the issue.    Another reason why Iraq is so important.  When the Saudi Revolution occurs, we need to be in a position to move quickly.  The oil fields are too vital to let them fall into the wrong hands.

       urlLink In the Media   As much as I bash Democrats, from time to time one of them says something that deserves praise.  I picked this up on  urlLink Instapundit .  Joe Leiberman, in his own words.   The Islamist jihadist terrorists who wage holy war against us in Iraq and elsewhere represent a system of values exactly the opposite of America's.   There is no better way to know this enemy than to read their words. The father of the jihadist movement, Sayyed Qutb [KUH-tahb] of Egypt, wrote in 1952, “The death of those who are killed for the cause of God gives more impetus to the cause, which continues to thrive on their blood.” The cause of which he speaks is to “establish a [Muslim] state” that “sets moral values,” “abolish[es] man-made laws” and that would impose, by force if necessary, the Islamic system on “all human beings, whether they be rulers or ruled, black or white, poor or rich, ignorant or learned.”   This is a radicalized, violent vision of Islam, as yet embraced by only a minority of Muslims. Pluralism of any kind – a diversity of views or faiths – affronts this radical minority's absolutist vision. Their theological totalitarianism leaves no room for individual freedom.   Restoring the caliphate – the seat of secular and ecclesiastical power that existed for centuries across a wide territory – is their goal. You can read it in their writings: They would create a new evil empire, stretching from Istanbul to Islamabad, from Khartoum to Kabul, from Kuala Lampur to Bangkok, and beyond.   Osama Bin Laden is the leading advocate of this jihadist view in the world today, the current mastermind of this malevolent movement. Every American should carefully read his clearly stated words of intention to know why we must defeat him.  In his “Declaration of the World Islamic Front for Jihad,” issued in February 1998, Bin Laden says that “to kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military, is an individual duty of every Muslim… every Muslim who believes in God and hopes for reward [must] obey God's command to kill the Americans and plunder their possessions wherever he finds them and whenever he can.”   In his November 1998 “Letter to America,” Bin Laden condemned the United States because, he said, like all democracies, it is a “nation who, rather than ruling by the Sharia of Allah in its Constitution and Laws, chooses to invent your own laws as you will and desire.” After September 11th attacks, he gloated triumphantly that “the values of Western civilization… of liberty, human rights, and humanity, have been destroyed.”   In this war of ideas and values, Bin Laden is the quintessential anti-American. . . .  The prison abuse scandal has caused many to question our moral standing in Iraq and to use it as an excuse to pull our troops out. That is thoroughly unjustified and profoundly dangerous. As I said earlier, the terrorists will never defeat us militarily. We cannot let them defeat us politically.    Here here!  Too bad people like Joe are driven from their party, much as Zell Miller in Georgia.  If the democrats could embrace rationality, then the nation as a whole would be better served.

       urlLink United Press International: 9/11 panel: New evidence on Iraq-Al-Qaida   Here's another reason why I think the harshest critics on the Left might be digging thier own metaphorical mass grave when it comes to the assertions that 'there are no WMD', or 'there is no connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda'.    Excerpt -  The commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks has received new information indicating that a senior officer in an elite unit of the security services of deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein may have been a member of al-Qaida involved in the planning of the suicide hijackings, panel members said Sunday.   News will continue to come out, and I think the case of the Left will continue to decay as we approach the election.  Unfortunately, the media will continue to grind away with their slant.  Here's an excerpt from  urlLink Boortz  this morning.  Excerpt -  The 9/11 Commission found there was a connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda.  Maybe not actual collaboration, but there was a connection.  Now ... read the headlines:  "Saddam, al-Qaeda Not Linked.  Sept. 11 Panel's Conclusion at Odds with Administration."  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.   "9/11 Panel Debunks Saddam Link.  Report:  No Evidence of al-Qaeda Ties."  Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  Now listen to the words of Keith Olberman of MSNBC last Wednesday.  "Memo to vice president:  9/11 Commission finds 'no credible evidence' of any link between al-Qaeda and Iraq."  You've already seen the stories ran by The Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN, Associated Press and more, all saying the same thing; all saying that the panel had found no link between Iraq and al Qaeda.  Now ... what does the Vice Chairman of the Panel say? Lee Hamilton says "There were connections between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's government.  We don't disagree with that.  What we have said is that we don't have any evidence of a cooperative or a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein's government and these al-Qaeda operatives with regard to attacks on the United States."   So the media is blasting Bush for something he didn't say, contorting his words of a connection between Iraq and AQ as a statement that Iraq had a leading role in 9/11.  Who knows, before this is all over, we might just find out that there was some connection, but for the moment, the US Administration hasn't made any such statement.  When will the media do their job?

       urlLink No One Asked Us   Major Stan Coerr is a Marine that served in Iraq, and has some things to say about why we fight.  Semper Fi.  Read the whole thing.  Excerpt- "I stood on the bloody sand where Marine Second Lieutenant Therrel Childers was the first American killed on the ground.  I pointed a loaded weapon at another man for the first time in my life.  I did what I had spent 14 years training to do, and my Marines - your Marines - performed so well it still brings tears to my eyes to think about it.  I was proud of what we did then, and I am proud of it now.  Along with the violence, I saw many things that lifted my heart.  I saw thousands of Iraqis in cities like Qurnah and Medinah - men, women, children, grandparents carrying babies - running into the streets at the sight of us, the first Western army to arrive.  I saw them screaming, crying, waving, cheering.  They ran from their homes at the sound of our Humvee tires roaring in from the south, bringing bread and tea and cigarettes and photos of their children.  They chattered at us in Arabic, and we spoke to them in English, and neither understood the other.  The entire time I was in Iraq, I had one impression from the civilians I met: Thank God, finally someone has arrived with bigger men and bigger guns to be, at last, on our side."

       urlLink Hammorabi :   The Hammorabi Blog is another originating from inside Iraq, written by a native Iraqi.  It's gratifying to see his reaction to the murder of Paul Johnson and the subsequent killing of the thugs who murdered him, even if the Saudis acted too late.  Excerpt- "It is confirmed now that Abd-Alaziz Bin-Essa Bin-Hammad Al-Muqrin (33 years) the leader of the Qaeda in KSA and top two of his thugs (Faisal & Abdulaziz Al-Dakheel) have been send to HELL killed. He was most likely the one who appeared in the video of Falluja Brigade which threatned to kill PJ. The question is not how he was killed but why not have been captured before or killed? And is this means the Saudi securty have not done enough to crak down the terrorist? Now the Saudi securty received the orders to finish Muqrin only now to avoid the wrath of the civilized people! Why not before!? Why not before? A big question need not answers but millions of answers! Finish the Wahabism which is the doctrine and ideology feeds the terrorists! Hell is the place of Muqriin and soon for Zarqawi! "

       urlLink CNN.com - Hospital: 17 Iraqis killed in Fallujah airstrike - Jun 19, 2004   US Forces struck a number of houses in Fallujah and killed 17 Iraqis.  At the same time, CNN is now reporting that one of the houses destroyed was a safehouse of al-Zarqawi.  This is encouraging news.  I wonder if we got him?  That would certainly be a plus.  We'll see how the news develops.    While the enemies of the war will certainly decry any bombing of houses in the middle of the city, I think we have to keep a historical perspective of war in general.  At least we aren't looking at Dresden or Tokyo here in terms of raw carnage.  I know, little consolation to the Iraqi boy playing the street when the bombs come, but I don't see how it can be helped.  The  enemy is engaging in asymettric warfare, using the general population to cloak the guerilla forces.  The best thing the civilian population can do to help themselves is begin to stand up against those that would use them in this fashion.  Evidence suggests that many Iraqis are starting to do just that - turning in their neighbors and feeding information to the coallition.  I wouldn't be surprised to find out that some Iraqis dropped the dime on these safehouses.  Civilian death is regretable, but the survivors will have a better life someday.

       urlLink FOXNews.com - U.S. & World - Saudi Al Qaeda Leader Killed in Riyadh   Well, at least we got one of the bastards today.  Although I have to admit some surprise that a terrorist was actually killed in Saudi Arabia, but Saudis!  The Saudis have a long history of not trying too hard to find Islamic terrorists on their own soil.  You may recall in the hostage siege a few weeks ago, the Saudi forces allowed several of the bad guys to get away.  I guess that's what you get in a country that actively supports  Wahhabi Islam.   Saudi Arabia will never really be a friend of ours, and we are merely uneasy dependents for now - we need their oil, they need our money.  The Saudi issue is so complicated, and the longer we are beholden to their oil, the longer we're going to be forced to maintain this uneasy dance with them.  All the more reason we need to return to domestic oil exploration, as well as doing all we can to help the Russians develop and export their vast oil reserves.  Until then, we can't afford to let the House of Saud go under, so we are forced to play this game that we are allies.  The reality is that Saudi Arabia is a ticking time bomb of potential hatred.   urlLink 43% of the population  of Saudi Arabia is under the age of 14.  Couple young people with high unemployment, radical Wahhabi Islam, and a festering hatred for all things Western, and the result are quite predictable.  So for now, we have to help the Saudi family remain in power, stabilize the oil supply, and build up Iraq as a nice convenient staging point to exert influence on the region for that inevitable day when the Islamic revolution takes over a sizable percentage of the world oil supply.  The war in Iraq extends well beyond the War on Terror.  This is just the first stage in a radical strategy to finally confront the mess in the Middle East.

      Why am I always so nervous meeting people?  I guess I'm surprised at how timid I can be when it comes to strangers.    Several months ago, I saw a guy here at work reading a book about screenwriting during lunch.  I quietly filed the observation away and didn't act on it, until recently.  A few weeks ago I sent him an email (after figuring out his identity), and introduced myself as someone also interested in writing.  We had a good exchange, but business at work and a vacation on his part prevented us from actually meeting face to face.  Until today.  I'm about to go have lunch with him, and try to figure out what we have in common with the hopes of finding someone who has a strong interest in writing.  Hopefully the email exchanges are some indication of a positive conversation.  I'm also taking a sample of Wrecks with me to pawn off on him.  I'll report back later.

         Might as well post two films tonight.  Diane and I watched Mystic River tonight, and I should comment on how good it was.  As much as I'd love to stuff both Tim Robbins and Sean Penn in a deep dark hole, I usually enjoy their films.  They continue with their strings of fine work with this one.  Mystic River was directed by Clint Eastwood, who continues to demonstrate his outstanding ability to craft films.  What struck me about this one was the pacing - the story can get quite convoluted, and at 2 hours and 15 minutes, it's pretty long.  But all of the details, and all the development never escaped me.  I never once had to stop and think "who is this guy again?  What was his name?"  It flowed along like a great novel, and when the tragic inevitability began to loom in the distance, I could see it while still hoping it could be avoided.    Like House of Sand and Fog, the characters in this story are all flawed, and essentially aren't bad human beings.  An argument can be made about Sean Penn, but I still found him sympathetic - a man living by a rough code, doing what he sees as right.  Everyone has a big jagged piece of glass in their soul here, and the pain propels them along in ever tightening circles, leading to mistakes that can't be undone.  The only weakness is in the Kevin Bacon character...not in Bacon's performance, but in the way the story manufactures his own little subset of pain that really has little to do with the story.  Maybe some of the meat had been cut from the film, but as it stands his issue should have been completely removed.  I would recommend Mystic River with the same enthusiasm that I recommended House of Sand and Fog.  Films like this work to return my optimism about cinema.

         I watched 28 Days Later on Tuesday, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  It's two hours long, so when I popped it in, I anticipated some impatience to get through it.  My expectations weren't that high.  The two hours flew by.  There's nothing huge here, no wonderful effects, no Big Moments that will Alter My Life.  It was just a fun, entertaining, well written, wonderfully filmed piece of work, even for an $8 million dollar budget.   urlLink The Mojo  reveals the film made $82 million on $15 million in expenses.  That made me happy, because it deserves to make some cash.  28 Days was directed by the guy who directed Trainspotting (which is another great film), and his use of digital video was a great choice for this particular story.  It has a grittiness that works well for the subject material.  The DVD includes two alternate endings, plus one radical alternate ending that changes the movie from the halfway point.  The radical ending is told with storyboards and dialogue, similar to one of the alternate endings on the Se7en DVD.  For once, the primary ending, despite being upbeat, was perfect for the tone of the film.  If you know anything about me, I love films that give you a good swift kick on the nether regions on the way out, but in this case, I liked it better with the 'happy' conclusion.  Call me soft, but it worked well here.  No, it isn't a typical Elite Bastard film.  It isn't the archetype of all films of this genre, and it won't whiten your teeth...but I really enjoyed it despite being skeptical.  Give it a view, and watch the different endings.

       urlLink  UNMOVIC Quarterly Briefing   This is in relation to the previous post, and the comments about the news report not being true.  I've linked here the Quarterly Briefing to the Security Council by UNMOVIC.    Excerpts -   The Commission’s experts are conducting an investigation in parallel with the IAEA Iraq Nuclear Verification Office regarding the discovery of items from Iraq that are relevant to the mandates of UNMOVIC and IAEA at a scrapyard in the Netherlands. In particular, following a visit of IAEA to a scrapyard in Rotterdam to investigate increased radiation readings, it was discovered, through photographs taken at the time, that engines of SA-2 surface-to-air missiles were among the scrap (see figure below). They are the type of engines used in the Al Samoud 2 proscribed missile programme. In addition, a number of items and equipment that may also be relevant to the UNMOVIC mandate were seen among the scrap. The existence of missile engines originating in Iraq among scrap in Europe may affect the accounting of proscribed engines known to have been in Iraq’s possession in March 2003. Both IAEA and UNMOVIC have kept the Security Council informed of this matter.  ...  Representatives of the scrapyard company indicated that a number of similar engines (5 to 12) had been seen in the scrapyard in January and February of this year. More engines could have been processed and passed through the yard unnoticed. Company staff confirmed that other items made of stainless steel and other corrosion-resistant metal alloys bearing the inscription “Iraq” or “Baghdad” had been observed in shipments delivered from the Middle East since November 2003.  ...  It should also be noted that the scrapyard that was visited by UNMOVIC deals in high-quality stainless steel. Items and equipment made of dual-use materials subject to the provisions of the monitoring plan may also be coming out of Iraq to other destinations. The Commission is continuing its investigation.  ...  In addition, the Commission is aware from comparative analysis of recent satellite imagery that a number of sites previously known to have contained equipment and materials subject to monitoring have been either cleaned out or destroyed.  ...  There is much evidence that from 1999 to 2002 Iraq procured materials, equipment and components for use in its missile programmes. In several instances, the items procured were used by Iraq for programmes, such as the production of Al Samoud 2 missiles, that were determined by UNMOVIC in February 2003 to be proscribed.  ...  The same Iraqi governmental trading company was involved, through a contract with two foreign private companies, in procuring components and equipment for the manufacture and testing of missile guidance and control systems, including inertial navigation systems with fibre-optic and laser ring gyroscopes and Global Positioning System equipment, accelerometers, ancillary items and a variety of production and testing equipment. The list of items sought includes several that were not declared or shown to UNMOVIC during the course of its inspections.  There's plenty more.  Read the whole thing - it's only 15 pages.  The evidence is clear that Iraq was 1) not revealing what they had, 2) pursuing proscribed technology, 3) violating UN mandates on weapons tech, and 4) making false statements about disarming.  Sure, as far as we know, we don't have the smoking gun of a nuclear weapon, but the UN mandate extended to many banned technologies, all of which Iraq had continued to pursue.  Do you really think he wasn't trying to get WMD tech?

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Text of Margaret Thatcher's Eulogy   This was the best moment of the service to me.   "He sought to mend America's wounded spirit, to restore the strength of the free world, and to free the slaves of communism."  What more can be said? It is his optimism, his clarity of purpose that I most admire. I think we all know we live in the world he more than any other created.

Both 'sides', if you will, need to discuss it more openly and with a greater sense of scope.

       urlLink MSNBC - Brigitte Bardot fined for inciting racial hatred   I meant to post on this yesterday but I had a busy day here.  Bardot is just another uber-Leftists who moved to France and spends her time supporting causes like PETA, but she's in hot water again for speaking her mind.  For the fourth time, a court in France has fined her for saying something bad about Muslims.    Quote - “Mme. Bardot presents Muslims as barbaric and cruel invaders, responsible for terrorist acts and eager to dominate the French to the extent of wanting to exterminate them,” the court said."  Uh, yeah.  And what part of that isn't true?  Anyway, remember that France is a model nation of the Leftist cause.  They want us to be more like that.  I guess this Blog would earn me quite a bit of court time if that ever came to pass.

       urlLink Georgia Property Tax Guide - Real Estate Transfer :   I picked up on this from Boortz today.  Here is what appears on the Georgia Department of Revenue web site regarding the Real Estate Transfer tax.  "The real estate transfer tax is not a property tax. It is an excise tax on the privilege of selling property."  Privilege???  Granted by whom?  Do we or do we not own our own land (unfortunately, the answer is 'no, we don't').  This is the kind of thing that is all too common nowadays, akin to Mark's post about 'Mandatory Registration'.  We just accept it and move on, without really considering what it means on a deeper level.  If you accept this statement, you endorse the idea that the State government owns your property, since they grant the 'privilege' of selling it.    Welcome to serfdom.  And thank a Leftist....

       urlLink Stem Cell Research   OK, here is an issue that completely sets me against GWB and the GOP position.  Any curtailment of bioresearch is unacceptable to me, and I'll speak out any time I have the chance.  The fact is - I want to live as long as possible, and if medical science has a shot at extending my life, then I want that research to happen.  There have been some promising finds in anti-aging research, and it isn't a fantasy to beleive that a child born today could live 150-200 years baring an accident.  By the time they finally pass on, children born in that year might live three times as long, or even have a reasonable life expectency measured in millenia, given body replacement technology.  Glenn Reynolds of Instapundit had a column at TechCentralStarion today, linked  urlLink here  about longevity.  It raises some intersting questions - notably, how will people react to research that might one day make death an accident?  And how do we meet the objections of the religious who might oppose the idea that we can 'escape God's judgment' by avoiding death?  Or how about the environmental people who complain about overcrowding (which is a myth) and wish to preserve our 'natural' life span?  I'm with Mr. Reynolds - death sucks, and natural is not always good.  Anto-aging research, as well as death prevention technology, is a moral requirement.  Anyone care to argue that we have a duty to die?  I'm loaded for bear on this one, so bring it on....(spoiling for a good argument too, so help me out here.)

      David DeAnda  20 Feb 1968 - 9 Jun 1993  Not to be all morose today, but this marks the 11th year since his death.  Time is lessening the impact, but it would be foolish to say that it doesn't mean anything to me.  While I don't feel a constant sense of loss, I do recognize that the person I am now was fundamentally formed in the few years after his loss.  So it has had a tremendous impact on my life, just not a constant, persistent presence as it was so long ago.  I still miss him, and I know there are so many things about today's world he would have loved (especially the net).  But he made a choice, and it can't be undone.

       urlLink ASL Pictures   This is a slow link since it is coming from my home server.  Since I've been desperately trying to recruit people into ASL, I thought I'd include some pictures of this past weekends action.  The map was hand made by my opponent, and is designed to convey the three dimensional aspect of the terrain.  Note that he built this whole thing for one specific scenario - it isn't usable for any other.  An example of the typical level of dedication you will find in ASL players, and yes, I would love to start building my own maps when I can accumulate some supplies.  The scenario revovled around an attempted capture of Tito by German SS  Fallshirmjagers  (paratroopers) arriving by both chute and glider.  It was an amazing scenario!  Particularly when a stick of SS men mis-dropped right into the center of town, only to be whacked by Partisans before they could even touch the ground.  On the other side of the map, another group of SS managed to come down right on top of my defensive position and engaged in Hand to Hand combat practically while still wearing parachutes.  They slaughtered some of my men and secured the flank.   Ubermenschen  in action.  Anyway, most of you don't really care, but my enthusiasm for the game knows no bounds.  It is the ultimate game system - really more of a lifestyle.  And I'll be glad to run demos at a moments notice....

       urlLink New England Republican: Tom Brokaw Interviews President Bush   Media bias?  New England Republican compared a video of an interview by Tom Brokaw with President Bush, then compared it to the transcript.  Take a look at this sample (bold items were excised from the video).  Brokaw: “And you were not greeted as liberators like Vice President Cheney said that you would be.”  Bush: “Well, I think we've been -- let me just -- I think we've been thanked by the people of Iraq.  And I think you'll hear more of that from people like Prime Minister Alawi and the foreign minister, who both have repeatedly, ‘Thank you for what you've done, and by the way, help us.’   “It's not easy work to take a country from tyranny to a free society.  And we'd been there a little over a year. And it's-- you might recall if you're looking for parallels in World War II, it took about four years to get an active reconstruction effort going.  “And in my speech that you referred to, I make-- pointed out that in the immediate aftermath of World War II, there was a-- the Soviet Union exploded a bomb, that China went communist. It was a question of whether or not the Greek government would go communist.  “The reconstruction effort was halting at best. The marshal plan hadn't been started. And I-- my only point is, these are difficult assignments. It was a difficult assignment then. It's a difficult assignment now. And what America must do is understand the consequences of getting it right. And the consequences of getting right is that  a free society in the Middle East is going to help change the country, change the countries in the Middle East and make us more secure and the world more peaceful.”  Remember this next time you see a taped interview of the President.  They don't seem to have a problem taking out portions of his answers that might actually help bolster his case for going into Iraq.

      The saddest thing you could ever experience, even from a distance....  My brother Mark and his wife Amber lost their baby.  She was about 6 months pregnant.  The cause is still uncertain, but an infection seems to be the likely culprit.  They were in the hospital on Sunday and all seemed OK.  They went back Sunday night and he was gone.  She gave birth to Aiden Curick Mayo on Monday morning.  He was about 2.5 lbs, about 13 inches long.  He had Mark's mouth and Amber's dark hair.   Curick (sp?) is for both his grandfathers' middle names - Curtis and Frederick.    I was there on Monday afternoon and got to hold him.  He was bundled up in blankets and wore a knitted blue cap.  At first it was difficult to touch his downy little face - my fingers just wouldn't go down all the way - but Mark unbundled him to show me his long fingers and encouraged me silently...  The hardest part, for the interlopers at least, is verbalizing.  What to say, what not to say.  How much to give without getting in the way.  Immediate plans, insipid details, emotional platitudes...it seems impossibly and simultaneously both vital and futile.  Though I am still uncertain as to what role the Lord has in my own life, I'm thankful that He is in my childrens' life.  It is such a fragile existence....I am eternally grateful that my two are healthy and intelligent - and more spiritual than I.

"He profited from good timing and good luck, coming along when the country was tired of the dour pedantry of the Carter administration, wounded by the Iranian hostage crisis, frustrated by rising unemployment and unyielding inflation. Mr. Reagan's stubborn refusal to accept the permanence of Communism helped end the cold war. He was fortunate to have as his counterpart Mikhail Gorbachev, a Soviet leader ready to acknowledge his society's failings and interested in reducing international tensions."  "...The flawed theory behind the Reagan tax cuts, that the ensuing jolt to the economy would bring in enough money to balance the budget, is still espoused by many of the Republican faithful, including President Bush..."  "...Today, we live in an era defined by that particular kind of simplicity, which expresses itself in semi-detached leadership and a black-and-white view of the world.

       urlLink From Revolution to Reconstruction: Presidents: Ronald Wilson Reagan: Speech at Pointe de Hoc :  Twenty years ago, Reagan gave a speech at Pointe-du-Hoc.  Since we've addressed both of them today, I went looking for the text of the speech.  It's worth reading the whole thing, but here is a taste.   "We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of France. The air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June 1944, 225 Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs. Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance.   The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers -- at the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine-guns and throwing grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting only ninety could still bear arms. "

       Ronald Reagan: Greatest President of the 20th Century   Forgive me if this is meandering and overly sappy.  Reagan is the greatest President of the 20th century because he showed us the truth of what we could be. He was our messiah in a time of great danger. A Moses who parted the Red Sea of Communism and lead the world to the prmised land. Do not scoff or roll your eyes. If you were in front of me I would slap you.   Communism was Reagan's great focus. I agree with him that collectivism is the greatest threat to humanity that has ever existed. Reagan led the world in the fight against it. People decry the spending and tax cuts that Reagan forced througha begrudging Democrat Congress. They say victory against Communism was a forgone conclusion. They say Reagan ruined the economy. They reduce Reagan to a clever actor in over his head. They are liars.   The President is the most important man in the world. He sets the tone for all of humanity. Nixon, Ford, Carter: these were weak men with small and timid ideas. Reagan had big ideas and the will to make them happen. Cutting taxes on the wealthy led to the greatest prosperity the world has ever seen. Building up our armed forces to undefeatable heights forced the Soviets to implode. Reagan's love of America, of freedom, and of the human spirit changed the face of the earth. Imagine the world if Reagan lost to Carter? You can't, and thats a good thing.  Reagan gave us hope in a time of hopelessness. He solved our problems by reducing them to insignifigance. Our spirits were lifted above them. We destroyed Communism in Europe and continue to do so In China because we refuse to stop being who we should be. We are now no longer afraid of petty tyrants and despots. There is no sense of hopelessness and defeatism in America today. At least not in the "real" America of the  urlLink Red  states.  My first recollection of Reagan was after the Challenger disaster. I remember being heartbroken, even at the tender age of 8. I don't remember what he said, but I do remember seeing Reagan on TV comforting the nation. I remember a few other of his speeches and conferences. Of course I was too young to appreciate it but I use Reagan as my reference for Presidents. I can tell you no man since has been his equal. George W. Bush is the inheritor of Reagan's spirit, but he cannot equal his progenitor.  I love Reagan and I believe the rest of America loves him because he was the best of us. What other President can be seen as so American? Honest, compassionate, dilligent, eloquent, steadfast, brave, and proud. He saw us as the beacon of freedom, the greatest hope of humanity. his legacy will carry on with us for the rest of our lives. How many other men can lay claim to such greatness? I consider myself fortunate to be able to look back and appreciate what those who came before have left for me. We should all seek to leave the world better than when we found it, as Ronald Reagan did.

      I can’t let D-Day get away from me without some sort of post.  As a World War II fanatic, yesterday had particular importance to me.  I can easily stand behind the idea that June 6, 1944 was the single most important day in the 20th century, and the outcome was far from certain.  While many may argue that Nazi Germany couldn’t possibly hold out against the combined might of the Allies, imagine what would have happened if this assault had failed?  Imagine fifty thousand dead, with a follow up invasion put off by another year, or even two.  Imagine the possibility that an exhausted England could have lost the will to fight, and would have given Hitler the peace he so wanted in the west.  Or imagine an America that lost interest during the delay, and decided that if England wanted peace, then perhaps America should pay more attention to the Pacific.  The days after June 6th were far from certain.  In light of the troubles we face today, it is difficult to imagine any current generation meeting this challenge the way they did back then.  While the 1940s generation made a decision over what was worth dying for, the current generations have a hard enough time figuring out what to live for.  These men (and women) accepted the situation and went out and got the job done in ways that still brings tears to my eyes.  I see these veterans on TV and I get emotional, knowing that all the adulation and praise being heaped at their feet on the part of the media is mostly phony.  Yeah, phony.  We praise their sacrifice and bravery while at the same time allowing our own children to fail learning the lessons they teach.  Children come out of school understanding that the American’s interred Japanese-Americans in camps, but they don’t recognize the name Iwo Jima or Tarawa.  They can’t name the date of the Normandy Invasion, but they understand that we dropped nuclear bombs on Japan when ‘the war was all but over’.  If we really honored the men of WW II, we would fix this.  I for one plan on making my kids sick with information about these men, and if they don’t also tear up when they see the graveyards in France, then I have failed as a parent.  Watching the D-Day clips on TV, I think about the rangers at Pointe du Hoc (climbing a 100 ft cliff in broad daylight while the Germans stood up on top and shot down at them), or Major Howard’s Englishmen at Pegasus Bridge, seizing a vital crossroads in a night glider landing in the early morning hours, or of St Mere-Eligse and the Airborne soldier hanging on the steeple, helpless as the Germans gunned him down.  I think about the miracle of the FUSAG deception, using the name of Patton to freeze two Panzer divisions at Calais, buying valuable time for the beachhead to gain a hold on the thin sliver of bloody sand.  And I think about the individual soldiers, nineteen years old, dropping from the sky or wading through five feet of water in a hail of gunfire, knowing only that this was probably his last moment on earth, yet filled with a resolve not to let his buddies down.

Every American kid dreams of the World Series, but do they think about holding the (insert name of trophy nobody even knows here) over their head and kissing it??    I watched the entire game on Saturday, that game points out what I love/hate about playoff hockey... I wasted three hours of my life to watch Calgary lose, what a deflating moment, I hated it and I loved it.  By the by, he kicked it in anyway, his skate clearly jumped off of line a bit right when he was staring down at the puck...  I wish I were in a bar in Calgary right now...

       urlLink The Washington Times: AP   As is usual, those directly effected understand the truth.  Reagan's death is being particular felt in Eastern Europe.  They get it.   "'For us, Reagan was important because we knew he was really anti-communist, emotionally anti-communist,' said Zdenek Kosina, 65, a Czech computer specialist. 'For us, he was a symbol of the United States' genuine determination to bring communism to an end.'  Laurentiu Ivan, 35, a customs officer in the Romanian capital, struggled to describe Reagan's legacy and then said: 'It is due to him that we are free.'"  I think in another ten years, we will see similar reactions from the Middle East.

      Ronaldus Magnus 1911-2004  When someone of importance dies, it is fashionable for all the columnists and news outfits to begun running eulogies or other commentaries about the life of whomever just died.  The web is choking with summaries of Reagan’s life and accomplishments, and I’m sure you’ve had your fill of them this weekend.  Instead, I feel compelled to focus on what Reagan meant to me personally.  The news of his death isn’t really a surprise, and in many ways, it is a relief to know that the body has followed the mind, years late.  I can’t fathom the experience of the past decade for his family, and particularly for Mrs. Reagan.  It must be a particular form of hell to watch someone drift away from you in slow motion, knowing that he isn’t really in there anymore, yet the body still demands attention.  If there is a God, surely Reagan has been restored, and that’s a thought that fills me with some hope.  Early on Saturday morning, I read on Drudge that Reagan wasn’t likely to make it through the day (how does Drudge do it?).  I went on to my day of ASL, but my thoughts were already turning toward the 80s and what it meant for the nation and the world.  When I left ASL at 4 PM, the news had broke on the car radio, so I had another hour of drive time to really think about things as the fading AM station began a long, detailed summary of Reagan’s life, complete with sound bites.  In fact, there were so many quality pieces both on the radio and Fox News later; I suspect people had been quite busy getting this stuff together for quite some time.  I’m sure they have prepared packages for a lot of public figures…  My reactions in the car surprised me.  Like I had said, this wasn’t a surprise.  Yet I still felt waves of sadness, while at the same time, a fierce appreciation that a man like this had lived, and had risen to office precisely when the world needed him.  History has a way of producing the right men at the right time, introducing them to us at the very moment we most need whatever quality they bring along.  With Reagan, history provided.  Listening to portions of speeches, I was reminded of his strength and optimism, his warmth and resolve.  Here was a man who didn’t need nuance.  He knew what he saw, and labeled it as such, while at the same time not letting us forget that the root of his optimism came from us – we lifted him, and he simply pointed that out to us at a time when we couldn’t see it.  It is a testament to Reagan’s success that the very things he opposed have been demolished to such an extent it is easy to forget how threatening the times were.  The Soviet Union a memory, the Iron Curtain a quaint historical term, the Berlin Wall nothing more than a museum piece, and the malaise of the 1970s as something we scratch our heads over in bemusement.  Whether you wish to believe his policies accomplished all of these things is your personal choice, since many will refuse to credit him until their last breath.  I don’t need to defend him.  History will get it right, and Reagan’s stature will grow with each passing year while history places the events of his presidency in the bright light of critical examination.  I trust in the final verdict.  Personally, I despised Reagan while he was president.  It matters little, but that is something that fills me with shame – that I was too stupid and gullible to fully understand the very times I had the fortune to witness first hand.  I was a raging leftist, growing up on a steady diet of the mainstream media, wondering why America was supposed to be ‘great’ when we were so obviously flawed and corrupt.  I wondered how we had the audacity to impose our way of life on other cultures, and how, after Viet Nam, we could ever have the hubris to think our military was strong enough to stand against another armed power like the Soviet Union.  The Cold War was a misunderstanding, made worse by us and our pigheaded insistence that capitalism was so much better than communism.  In my mind, they were morally equivalent, and one was just as good as the other.  The gas lines of the 70s, and the interest rates and malaise were further indications that indeed our best days were behind us, and the best we could hope for was stasis.   What does it say when an eleven year old views the world this way?  I don’t recall my parent’s being very political back then.  It came from what I saw on TV, and what I read at school.  It came from a general sense of our culture.  For people our age, it is easy to forget how bad things were, since we were so young at the time.  Those slightly older have a clearer memory, and that clarity enhances the impact Reagan had when he assumed office.  He strode onto the stage, full of optimism and hope for a nation that had neither.  The elites hated him because he was obviously too stupid to understand the truth of where America was headed – who could be so hopeful in the face of such facts?  Through his presidency, he picked us up, dusted us off, and when we asked him where he found such reservoirs of optimism, he held up a mirror to our disbelieving faces.  Despite my hatred for him, a growing sense of respect had taken root in me, and when I felt that warm glow after one of his speeches; I chastised myself for ‘falling’ for his stagecraft.  It took me many years to get my thinking straight, long after he had left office.    The biggest moment in the Reagan presidency, for me, was the Summit at Reykjavik.  The Soviets handed us a bold proposal – a 50% reduction in warheads and the elimination of an entire class of nuclear missiles (intermediate range in Europe).  Imagine that.  It was a tremendous step toward disarmament, and any president would be pleased to take such an agreement home and present it to the congress.  Yet Reagan refused to give up SDI as a precondition.  He refused to place SDI on the block, knowing that he could not morally defend abandoning a defense program that might one day offer a better form of protection to the American people.  World reaction was uniformly negative.   urlLink Quote  - The press reported the Reykjavik "summit" as a failure. One U.S. congressman complained that Reagan had squandered "a chance to cash in 'Star Wars' for the best deal the Russians have offered us since they sold us Alaska." Others criticized Reagan for coming too close to an agreement with Gorbachev. "For a generation the security of the Western World has rested on nuclear deterrence," said James Schlesinger. "The American position at Reykjavik seems to have reflected no understanding of these simple fundamentals." Henry Kissinger warned that notions like the Zero Option undermined "the cohesion of the Western alliance." Indeed, America's NATO allies were mortified; they depended on a Western nuclear threat to defend Europe from the possibility of invasion by conventional Soviet forces.   In later years, Gorbachev said it was the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union.    The cynics, secure in their worldview that all that has happened was ‘inevitable’, easily dismiss his accomplishments as president.  I think that is further testament to his greatness.

      Calgary 3 Tampa Bay 2  You non-hockey people are about to get a break, because at most there are only two games left in the NHL season.  I'm thinking it's going to be over on Saturday in Calgary.  After all, how long can the Lightning play .500 hockey?  They've been getting away with that for too long.  Great game last night.  Iginla is simply amazing.  I am seriously getting flashes of Gretzky from him - not to say he will BE a Gretzky, but the way he can hold the puck in traffic reminds me of Wayne.  Several times he just appeared in the right place at the right time, or held the puck long beyond the point where any normal person should maintain possession.  That translates into scoring chances.  Great hockey in the finals.  No one is really screwing up, and both teams are working hard for goals.  Too bad no one really cares, as they are all waiting in breathless anticipation for the start of the NBA finals.  Bah!

      If Bush falls in the forest, and no one's around, can we still hear his lies?  "By far the vast majority of my tax cuts go to the bottom end of the spectrum." -G.W. Bush. 02/15/2000, at a debate in South Carolina, et. al.  Truth: 64.4% went to the top 5 percent of taxpayers. 7.7% to the bottom 80 percent.  urlLink Source    Now, Mike: Is it insufficient to say  "Bush lied!"  on  this  one? I think to proove that this is a lie would simply be restating what was above. To cover my bases, though, I'll try to proove there's a lie here before questions arrive:   Here's Bush's quote again: "By far the vast majority of my tax cuts go to the bottom end of the spectrum."  Now, let's look at the facts: Fact 1: The top 5 percent of American taxpayers are not on the bottom end of the spectrum. Fact 2: The majority of Bush's tax cuts went to the top five percent of American taxpayers.  I suppose if you interpret "the bottom end of the spectrum" as "those earning less than the top 1%,"  then  you might have something. Besides a mathematical intellect of Arthur Anderson bookkeepers, that is.  The economy is improving, eh?

       urlLink My Way News   Some of the most amazing quotes from John Kerry here.  Tell me he doesn't try to have it both ways?   Stepping gingerly into another social issue, Kerry reiterated that he believes that life begins at conception - and that a woman has the right to choose whether to abort.     So conception means life, but killing it is just fine with Kerry.  And before anyone pops a cork here, I happen to be an Atheist, and I don't really have any strong feelings about abortion.  But I think Kerry should at least be consistent here!  You can't have it both ways.  Wait, he tries to offer a further explanation.   "I don't believe personally that it's the government's job to step in and take my article of faith and transfer it to somebody who doesn't share that article of faith," said Kerry, a Roman Catholic.   I wonder...is 'Thou Shall Not Murder' transferable?  If life begins at conception, John, then what is an abortion?  Or is infanticide just fine with you?    But then we get into viability.     Asked whether he believes abortion is taking a life, Kerry said a fetus is a "form of life."  "The Bible itself - I mean, everything talks about different layers of development. That's what Roe v Wade does. It talks about viability. It's the law of the land." The Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v Wade ruling legalized abortion in America.   So if it is simply a measure of viability, then can you give me a moral argument against euthanasia of the elderly?  Removal of life support against the will of the patient?  Severely handicapped?  How about 'aborting' a two year old by just withholding food?  Where's the line?  And while we are on the subject of killing, where's Kerry on the Death Penalty?   Kerry has long been an opponent of the death penalty, but in recent years has made an exception for terrorism. The former prosecutor said crimes like rape and child murder do not warrant the highest punishment.  "It's certainly terrorizing to the person who's undergoing it. I understand that," Kerry said. "But terrorism is a political act to terrorize a nation, to try to challenge a way of life and a standard.. It's just a different act."   Ah, so killing a child isn't as bad as 'challenging a way of life'.

       urlLink NDOL: Michael Moore's Truth Problem by Peter Ross Range   Well well.  This is interesting.  A group called the New Democratic Leadership Council has a review of  Dude, Where's My Country  and it isn't too flattering.   And there you have the essential Moore -- a worldview of America as a failed project and an abiding danger to the planet. No wonder they so love Moore abroad: His is a 1960s vision, hardened in the pre-NAFTA plant closings of the 1980s, of a nation hijacked by the suits, the very guys who for decades gave Moore's father a good job at General Motors. It's from this posture that all the Moorean invective flows.    And who is the New Democratic Leadership Council.   In keeping with our party's grand tradition, we reaffirm Jefferson's belief in individual liberty and capacity for self-government. We endorse Jackson's credo of equal opportunity for all, special privileges for none. We embrace Roosevelt's thirst for innovation and Kennedy's summons to civic duty. And we intend to carry on Clinton's insistence upon new means to achieve progressive ideals.   We believe that the promise of America is equal opportunity for all and special privilege for none. We believe that economic growth generated in the private sector is the prerequisite for opportunity, and that government's role is to promote growth and to equip Americans with the tools they need to prosper in the New Economy.    I'm confused...

      Mike says: "Prove he said there were no weapons in Iraq."  "David Kay has found the capacity to produce weapons. And when David Kay goes in and says we haven't found stockpiles yet, and there's theories as to where the weapons went. They could have been destroyed during the war. Saddam and his henchmen could have destroyed them as we entered into Iraq. They could be hidden. They could have been transported to another country, and we'll find out." -G.W. Bush, Meet the Press, 2/7/04 So I guess I mispoke. I said that Bush admitted there were no weapons in Iraq. I should have said he admitted that he has failed to  find  any weapons in Iraq. Too bad you don't probe  him  for proof the way you do  me .  Mike says: "The truth is we can't really say for certain."  While I think it's safe to safe to say that we're never going to find such weapons, let's look at it your way. We really can't say for certain, huh? OK, fine, we can't. However... "We found the weapons of mass destruction. We found biological laboratories...for those who say we haven't found the banned manufacturing devices or banned weapons, they're wrong, we found them." -G.W. Bush, at an interview in Poland, 5/29/03 Just because we  can't  say for certain doesn't mean Bush  won't  say for certain.  Mike says: "The evidence that he had them, was planning on getting them, and used them is in the CIA report above."  Well, he certainly acted on that report, didn't he? I mean, wow! He acted the hell out on it! Way to take action, Bush! Too bad he didn't do the same with  urlLink this daily briefing from August 6, 2001.   Mike says: "Where is your evidence? This isn't a matter of logic or ideas but of simple hard facts."  Here's a hard fact: Saddam didn't plan the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers. Osama bin Laden did. And what does Bush have to say about Osama bin Laden? "I don't know where he is.You know, I just don't spend that much time on him... I truly am not that concerned about him." -G.W. Bush, at a press conference, 3/13/02  Mike says: "Bush lied!" is insufficient.  He told false information to the American people, built upon our fears, and lead us into a war based on this fear he instilled. "Relaying false information that he was told was true." That's what some call it it; others call it a lie. Bill O'Reilly and Michael Moore had this very interpretation battle not long ago. I understand that you aren't particularly fond of Michael Moore. Do you really want to reinact this discussion he had?     AT LEAST NO ONE DIED WHEN CLINTON LIED

      Mike asked: "Why can't we all agree on the Facts? [...] Facts like the improving economy."  Oh, you  can't  honestly believe that!  Since Bush took office we've lost 1.8 million private sector jobs. Even since the end of the recession – and even over the last 12 months – job growth has been the weakest we have seen since the 1930s.  Every month, approximately 150,000 more people enter the workforce. Bush has created more than 150,000 jobs  only FOUR of the past 41 months .  Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Economy.com and others have all found that between 66%-90% of new jobs are being created in low-end industries and occupations (lower wage jobs), and that the growth in temporary jobs continues to outpace full-time hiring.  Our economy has  7 million fewer jobs  than Bush's own Council of Economic Advisors projected it would have by now.  This year, more of the unemployed have been out of work for more than six months than in any year since 1983.  There are over 4.5 million workers that are working part-time, getting no benefits, because  they can’t find full-time work  (1.3 million more than when Bush took office).  Real weekly wages of average workers have actually fallen since the end of the recession.

       A few probing questions for our&nbsp;newest resident Leftist:     &nbsp;   1. Is a market economy, free of government control and manipulation but subject to reasonable regulation, a good thing? By reasonable I mean preventing harmful or misleading products from being sold. Or is it better to have active government intervention, such as farm subsidies, tariffs, the Federal Communications Commission, etc?     &nbsp;   2. Do you favor a graduated or flat system of income taxation? Not that salex tax is an example of a flat tax that makes no distinction between rich or poor but has the rich paying more due to higher prices of goods and services.     &nbsp;   3. Does the United States have a right to act unilaterally to ensure the safety of its citizens? Also, do we have a moral obligation to make the world&nbsp;a generally safer and more free place?     &nbsp;   4. Why is President Bush so evil and loathsome to the Left? I can honestly see no rational reason for it, as he has implemented policies far mroe liberal than Bill Clinton was allowed to. A medicare perscription drug bill, letting Teddy Kennedy write the Education bill, No Child Left Behind, etc.&nbsp;These seem to be cornerstones of a socialist policy that the Left favors. Why isn't Bush then likable or at least tolerated? Is it merely some sort of projection - a need to blame someone for the things you don't like?     &nbsp;   5. Why can't we all agree on the Facts? I refer to Facts such as Saddam's use of andpossession of WMDs and his refusal to comply with UN sanctions. Facts such as Kerry's reversal of stated positions. Facts like the improving economy. These facts are real, yet they are denied or ignored by the Left. Why?     &nbsp;   6. Do you claim to understand the meaning of the National Debt and its uses? It is not simply a "Debit" column in the national ledger. It is not soem large amount of money that must actually be paid back some day. It is the obligations and securities of the Federal Government. It is simply the cost of running the Government expressed as a simple number. It cannot ever be "called in" like a home mortgage. To draw an anaolgy, Donald Trump made his fortune primarily in real estate investing. He took out gigantic lons in the hundreds of millions of dollars. He did so in the knowledge that he was&nbsp;not going to pay them back under the initial terms. So when he could not pay, the lenders were forced to give him mroe favorable terms because the sheer amount of the loan was so massive that if Trump defaulted the lenders would go bankrupt themselves. A similar situation exists in the world today. The US Dollar is so ubiquitous and necessary that to allow it to become devalued substantially (by refusing to honor the credit of the US) would collapse the global economy.     &nbsp;   Sorry about that tangential discussion. To put it simply, I want you to tell me why the National Debt is some sort of issue, along with the Deficit.     7.&nbsp;Why should taxpayers fund PBS/NPR? What&nbsp;clause or amendment mandates or even excuses&nbsp;raising taxrs to pay for&nbsp;some media broadcast?    &nbsp;   I think thats enough for now. Sorry to do a pseudo double-post with Todd's Litany of Questions.     &nbsp;   I make no attempt to be fair, objective, or open to your ideas. I believe you are fundamentally wrong on almsot every issue, given your previous posts. I seek to convert you, not to form some sort of consensus or compromise. This is my opening salvo. We should use current events to illustrate and discuss fundamental concepts. I don't care to discuss Michael Moore's latest stunt or Kerry's latest gaffe. Because those don't really matter. We can discuss issues such as the cost of medicine, the War on Terror, and other issues of the day but I will always try to steer it towards some basic concept.     &nbsp;   I want you to answer both Todd's and my questions with reason and in some depth. I may be wrong, but I wager you have never truly pondered the ideas behind your stands on issues.     &nbsp;   Don't dissapoint me and refuse to take up my challenge.

      This again proves my political ignorance, but what exactly are these (party) National Conventions for? How does the election process work from this point on? Why do they cost so much money, and who pays for them?!   Point me to a link, if yer fingers are too tired....

      I would like to hear, from both sides in 100 words or less, how 'Clinton' created a budget surples in some 8 years, after the nation has been in the red for, I suspect, nearly 200 years.  First of all, is that last assumption true?  When I say 'Clinton', I mean Bill himself, the Clinton administration, and/or federal leadership at the time.

      Now that we have an intelligent Leftist on board (and I'm genuine about that...I think Danny is a smart, articulate guy even if I have just met him), I'd like to ask some questions.  Many times, it is difficult to understand exactly what the Left believes and why.  We get bogged down in the details without really addressing the Big Picture.  So I'd lile to ask some fundamental questions and get Danny's perspective, and then maybe we can get to some real debate about political philosophy.  So if you could take a few minutes and answer the following, I think we would appreciate it.  1).  Do you believe health care is a fundamental right?  How would you address the cost of drugs or medical care?  2).  Do you believe in hate crimes legislation, and why?  3).  Do you believe in the free market?  How much regulation is required?  4).  What is more important - that we live for ourselves or that we live for others?  5).  What is your position on the tenth amendment and what it says about 90% of all Federal regulation?  That should give us a good start to have a real discussion about philosophy, rather than sounding like a poor version of Hannity and Colmes.

      A Numbers Game!   With Clinton in office: For fiscal year 1999, the federal budget  surplus  was $122.7 billion.  urlLink Proof   With Bush in office: For fiscal year 2004, the annual federal budget  deficit  is $639 billion, [...] a near-record level for the post-World War II era.  urlLink Proof   According to the U.S. National Debt Clock, right now, Outstanding Public Debt is $7,295,929,465,739.86. Still, that number is not quite accurate because, in the time it took me to type this large number, the Deficit has already grown. It's impossible to keep up with. For the current amount, please visit the U.S. National Debt Clock at http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/ .

      First off, I'm glad Danny came on board, because I'm going to enjoy this, in a Ken Jennings way.  I am a little disappointed that Danny chose to post essentially what is a Michael Moore screed from Stupid White Men.  If you look point for point, it bears a striking semblance to  urlLink this .  But Danny did say he was posting 'talking points', so it isn't like he was passing off some other work as his own.  In the future, I'm looking forward to hearing HIS views, especially when we start to dissect them on the cold table of logic.    Just to re-iterate for Danny's benefit - I haven't been too happy with Bush.  I'm more of a conservative than a Republican, and if it wasn't for the War on Terror (WOT in this forum), I'd be sitting out this election.  Bush hasn't earned my vote on the domestic side, even though the tax cuts were a big help.  Bush isn't my horse, and aside from WOT, I wouldn't be all that upset to see him lose.    But the WOT is real, so I'll do what I can to get him re-elected (or elected for the first time if you prefer...sigh).  Let's stipulate for a moment about the criminal charges made here.  Let me grant you in theory that all of this is true and ask you a follow up question.  Why does it matter to Danny?  I'm not saying it is not relevant...I just want to know specifically why it might anger you.  I want to know what you think about it, and why.  You might certainly question the man's judgment for covering up a checkered past, but I find it amusing that you defend Gore for the pot admission, when I very much doubt there was a problem with "I didn't inhale".  Truth be told, that didn't really bother me about Clinton, beyond it being a laughable excuse.  I'd just like to know where you are coming from on this issue.  Then I'll be glad to discuss specifics.  Now for the funding cuts.  I'm reading your list of 'cuts' and I'm getting excited.  Oh how I wish they went even deeper.  But for the sake of argument, let's take one at random and run it through the Google Machine.  "Cut $700 million dollars in funds for public housing repairs."  Well, according to the  urlLink Council of Large Public Housing Authorities , it's even 'worse' then you say.   Eight and a half months after President Bush released his Federal budget blueprint, which proposed cutting the Public Housing Capital Fund by $800 million and eliminating the $310 million Public Housing Drug Elimination Grant program, Congress finally passed a HUD budget that will result in a funding reduction for all public housing of approximately 3% from last years' amounts. On November 6, the VA-HUD Conference Committee agreed to the Conference Report on the FY 2002 VA-HUD Appropriations. The House overwhelmingly passed the bill, 401-18, on Thursday, November 8, 2001. That same day, the Senate passed the measure, 87-7.     Wow, so it was $800 million, and it passed the House and Senate by a nail biting 383 and 80 votes respectfully.  Damn Republicans!  But then we read on...    While the bill is an improvement over the original HUD request for public housing, it still leaves agencies and their residents woefully shortchanged. The Conference Committee rejected the President's proposed dramatic cuts to the Public Housing Capital Fund and appropriated $550 million more than the President requested, however, the result is a $ 150 million reduction over last years' level.    So looks like they got a big chunk of the money back later.  Too bad.  So the real problem isn't that Bush tried to cut the budget...it's that he FAILED to cut the budget.  I'm upset with him over that.  I want REAL cuts in all of these programs.  But I still think it is unfair to criticize Bush for cuts that never happened, or at least do the research to see how the Congress voted on each proposed cut.  As I'm sure you know, Congress spends the money...the President just suggests how to spend it.  Try it out.  Pick a random 'cut' and start looking into it.  It's like a party game.  Take a drink when you find hypocrisy.  Philosophically though, I'd like Danny to explain how any of these programs are legally the mandate of the Federal Government.  Where does the government draw the authority to spend money on advanced pediatric training for doctors?  Or why does the Government feel it has the mandate to fund libraries (some day we will talk about libraries in great detail, and many will rue the day).  This cuts at the heart of political philosophy, and I'd like to hear the new guy's perspective on why the government should fund these things.  And lets talk about glorious Kyoto.  According to this  urlLink CBS News  story...    It will be the first such vote since the Senate voted 95-0 in 1997 to reject many of the principles behind an international climate treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan. The treaty was signed later that year by then-Vice President Al Gore but the Senate never ratified it.     So Clinton's failure to get the Senate to ratify a treaty (95-0...damn Republicans), becomes Bush's failure to implement the provisions?  Actually, even if the vote was 50-50 with Dick Cheney casting the tie breaker while rubbing a bust of Machiavelli, I would still be pleased  that this thing was killed.    But shove that aside for a moment and let's talk about the specifics of Kyoto.  Kyoto is not the ultimate solution to CO2 emissions.  There are other ways of doing it, and most of them are market driven.  The major flaw in Kyoto is the exemptions offered to developing countries, which routinely employ less efficient technologies for energy production, resulting in a high per capita emission.  By exemption developing countries for the foreseeable future, Kyoto ignores what will be a massive contribution to the CO2 levels over the coming decades.  The economic costs imposed upon the developed world, such as the US, is not an acceptable solution in light of these exemptions.  If a true environmentalist wants to see a reduction in gas, he should support the development of nuclear power, but somehow I don't think that's going to fly.  In the mean time, signing on to a treaty of dubious value, and accepting the resulting economic impact, isn't a sane thing to do.  There are other ways,   Take a look at this  urlLink DOE study  on carbon emission in the US.  The graph is particularly interesting.    As discussed below, factors such as a drop in carbon intensity in the electric power sector kept emissions growth in 2002 to less than the average annual growth rate since 1990...  Between 1990 and 2002, U.S. economic growth averaged 2.9 percent per year. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, however, grew by an average of 1.2 percent annually.     We are getting more efficient at power production, and we are doing it without Kyoto.  Imagine that....Go on, read the whole report and let's dissect it.  Finally, I have to go back to a  urlLink Michael Moore  criticism that struck me as amusing.    Pushed for development of "mini-nukes," designed to attack deeply buried targets-a violation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty    Well, if you go look at the  urlLink Treaty  web site and do some poking around, you'll find the following - (And I can't link directly to it because it is some sort of Java thing.  You can find it on your own, it's easy.)     State Information United States of America  Annex 2 State* Yes  Signature Date 24-SEP-1996  Ratification Date Not Ratified      Hmmm....we should honor a treaty that isn't ratified?  Between the Test Ban and Kyoto, it seems Bush's biggest crime is honoring the Congressional power to ratify treaties.  Damn Bush for following the Constitution.  See, the  urlLink Senate  voted down the treaty in 1999, by a 51-49 vote (okay, now you can say Damn Republicans).  So it has no force of law.  Why should we restrict ourselves to something that has no legal standing?  Oh yeah, it's kind of like the 'unilateral' argument with the UN, isn't it?  So, in the words of a great man...Bring it on!

      Hey, everyone! Full-blooded Lefty here to defend his fellow liberals.   I'll apologize in advance if I happen to say something that has already been covered in this blog. While I've read several postings, it's very likely that I may unintentionally repeat something. After all, I haven't been here as long as the rest of you.   For now, I'll hold off on my comments regarding Iraq, just because I'm pretty confident that that topic has been brought up a lot already.  For my first contribution, here are a few talking points regarding our President. (Note: It is not out of sloth that I don't bother to spell out his full title, "President-elect." I just call 'em as I see 'em.)    *When asked in 1999 about his alleged cocaine use, he responded that he has had "no felonies in the last 25 years." What do you suppose that tells you about his life prior to 1975?  *He's been arrested three times, including a time in 1976 when he was found DUI. I'm not saying that something that happened twenty-four years before his campaign for President should keep him from running for office. I just wonder why he and everyone involved in his campaign lied about it and covered up the truth for so long. Al Gore was man enough to admit that he had smoked pot as a teenager, and he still managed to get 500,000 more individual votes than Bush.  *Later on, when people found out why he really was arrested in 1976 (drunk driving, not "driving too slow" like he proclaimed), he responded "It was back in my youth." His youth? He was 30!  As for stuff that happened after within the first few months after he took office:  *"It's amazing I won. I was running againnst peace, prosperit, and incumbency." -George W. Bush, July 14, 2001. Speaking to Swedish Prime Minister Goran Perrson, unaware that a live TV camera was still rolling.  All kinds of funding cuts: *Cut $35 million in funding for advanced pediatric training for doctors. *Cut $39 million from federal spending on libraries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun side-note:  He actually proposed eliminating the "Reading is Fundamental" program, which gives free books to poor children. *Cut funding for research into cleaner, more efficient cars and trucks by 28%. *Reduced, by 86%, the Community Access Program, which coordinated care for people without health insurance among hospitals, clinics, and other health care providers. *Cut funding for the Girls and Boys Clubs of America programs in public housing by $60 million. *Cut $200 million from workforce training programs for dislocated workers. *Cut $200 million from the Childcare and Development grant, a program that provides child care to low-income families as they are forced from welfare to work. *Cut $700 million dollars in funds for public housing repairs. *Cut $500 million from the Environmental Protection Agency's budget. *Cut $15.7 million from programs dealing with child abuse and neglect.  Among his broken campaign promises: *He did not invest $100 million per year in rain forest conservation *He has not regulated carbon dioxide emissions, a major contributor to global warming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun side-note:  He actually pulled America  out  of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol agreement on global warming, ultimately signed by 178 other countries  Ooh, and here's a goody: He denied college financial aid to students convicted of misdemeanor drug charges, though convicted murderers are still eligible.  Yes, all of that happened just within the first few months of his administration, but he still managed to spend 42% of his first seven months on vacation.   Any rebuttles?

"As if that weren't bad enough, former Denver mayor Wellington Webb then introduced singer Wyclef Jean to sing a song as a companion piece.

       urlLink Redistribution Is Theft No Matter Who Does It   Terry sent me this tonight, and I think you've heard a similar argument from me in the past.  I still don't think Steve buys into it though...    "Regardless of the purpose, such behavior is immoral. It's a reduced form of slavery. After all, what is the essence of slavery? It's the forceful use of one person to serve the purposes of another person.   When Congress, through the tax code, takes the earnings of one person and turns around to give them to another person in the forms of prescription drugs, Social Security, food stamps, farm subsidies or airline bailouts, it is forcibly using one person to serve the purposes of another. "   Hard to argue with the premise.

      &nbsp;  urlLink Teresa Kerry’s Remarks   So I’m checking out the sites this morning and I run across an excerpt of Te-RAY-sa’s remarks to the DNC last night.&nbsp; I didn’t see her speak, but I did tune in just in time to see Fox News talking about it, and the collective attitude, even with the token Leftists, was – “What in the world just happened?”&nbsp; Chris Matthews said he half expected her to break out in “Don’t cry for me, Argentina” at the end of her speech.&nbsp; Funny stuff.  So I find her remarks on Drudge, and I can’t resist a little  urlLink fisking .&nbsp; I know, she’s just a candidate’s wife, but it still is kind of amusing.    John believes in a bright future.He believes he can, and will, invent the technologies, new materials and conservation methods of the future. He believes that alternative fuels will guarantee that not only will no American boy or girl go to war because of our dependency on foreign oil. But also that our economic security will forever become independent of this need.   We can, and we will, create good, competitive, and sustainable jobs while still protecting the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the health of our children, because good environmental policy is good economics.    John, personally, will invent new technologies?&nbsp; I know he is smart, but sheesh.&nbsp; But I guess it fits the template of the Left…ALL that is good springs from the government.&nbsp; But after seeing Kerry in the NASA bunny suit, I wonder if it is a good idea to point out his nerdy uber-competence with science.&nbsp; You know, if Kerry can invent the technologies, maybe he should be spending his time in a lab and leave the presidency to someone with fewer distractions.&nbsp; For the good of the nation, I call upon Kerry to turn his awesome intellect to the problem of conservation.&nbsp; He would be of better service there. &nbsp;Isn't it time we began working to give parents more opportunity to be with their children and to afford to have a family life?    Let me rephrase that – “Isn’t it time we work harder so parents can work less?”&nbsp; Hmmmmm…&nbsp; I, too, look forward to the day when people without families sacrifice so I may stay home and spend time with my family.&nbsp; It is for the good of the nation, and no call to service can be nobler.&nbsp; Mike and Eric, I expect a stronger effort from you two in the future.&nbsp;    John is a fighter. He earned his medals the old-fashioned way, by putting his life on the line for his country. No one will defend this nation more vigorously than he will-and he will always be first in the line of fire.    Always first in the line of fire?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Has he cleared that with the Secret Service?&nbsp; Do we really want the man who can single handedly solve conservation problems in a position of danger?&nbsp; Wouldn’t it be better to let the Marines do what Marines have always done?&nbsp; Maybe we can get Kerry in a Dukakis helmet on an M-1, but after he takes off the NASA bunny suit.  The truth we must speak now is that America has responsibilities that it is time for us to accept again. With John Kerry as President, global climate change and other threats to the health of our planet will begin to be reversed.    So while we are off confronting the biggest threat to western civilization, she thinks it is time for us to accept our responsibilities once again.&nbsp; Namely, the larger threats of climate change that Kerry is going to solve for us in his spare time.&nbsp; Hmm…&nbsp; Raving Islamofascist…greenhouse gas….yeah, I’m having trouble with that sense of perspective as well.&nbsp;

      ***Vanity Post Warning***  I'm trying out a new writing group here in town&nbsp;tonight, and I decided to take this piece in to submit.&nbsp; I read it a couple of times today, and am still quite pleased with it although it is three years old now.&nbsp; I thought 'what's the use of having a blog if you don't inflict your writing on others?', so I thought I'd try to post it with the new Blogger system and see how it handled the format.&nbsp; Turns out it isn't too bad, so here it is.&nbsp; If you aren't interested, scroll right by and ignore it, and rest assured I won't do this too often.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Allgemeine Kosten  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rats celebrate the carnage.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rest for a moment, with my back pressed against the rough plaster wall, watching the rats as they chew on the blasted remains of the man who died here last night.&nbsp; He was Russian, so I leave the rats to their feast.&nbsp; Before long, it will be my turn, so I watch them with interest as they take small bites, licking their tiny lips and cleaning their little claws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dead man’s face gazes upon me, eyeless and empty.&nbsp; What do you leave behind, I wonder? &nbsp;Is there a family to mourn you?&nbsp; Will anyone remember what you did here?&nbsp; If we survive this city, we will write the history, and you will be forgotten. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My breath escapes in ragged plumes.&nbsp; The cold air cuts through my thin uniform.&nbsp; The light cloth was never intended to shelter us from the depths of a Russian winter, but like most of my fellow soldiers of the Reich, I endure.&nbsp; I shiver to keep my muscles warm; marshaling what little strength I have remaining. I can hear the Russians in the next room, waiting across the hallway.&nbsp; I count three men by their voices.&nbsp; In the vastness of the Russian countryside, the front line has degenerated to the hallway separating these two rooms.&nbsp; We’ve been here for a few hours, waiting on relief, waiting on a mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting to die. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expected grenade through the doorframe never comes.&nbsp; The Russians have their own problems with proper supplies.&nbsp; While the Luftwaffe commands the skies, the suicidal supply convoys continue to cross the Volga, losing far more than they put ashore.&nbsp; What meager supplies that make it through are insufficient to equip the defenders of the city, but somehow they manage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side of the hall, the Russians stir.&nbsp; I can hear a new man there now.&nbsp; He has the voice of authority.&nbsp; I thumb the safety on my gun and shift behind an overturned metal file cabinet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A burst of fire punctures the thin plaster walls, spraying the room with small powdery flakes.&nbsp; I duck behind the cabinet, waiting on the hail of gunfire to stop as I aim my weapon at the open doorway.&nbsp; The first man charges through the door, empty-handed.&nbsp; His task is to force me to expend ammunition, depleting my meager supplies.&nbsp; Such is the determination of our enemy.&nbsp; In his face, I read the all too familiar resignation I have seen in so many.&nbsp; He glances around, taking in the room in which he will die.&nbsp; His eyes close as my gun cuts him down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second man leaps over the body of the first, knowing where I am from the sound of my gun.&nbsp; He stumbles on a loose brick and snarls at me with contempt.&nbsp; He, too, goes down before my gun.&nbsp; A third man hurdles the bodies of the first two, screaming in terror as he fires his rifle.&nbsp; The bullets bite into the file cabinet and small metal slivers strike my face.&nbsp; I fire my final burst, and my gun is empty.&nbsp; He staggers forward despite the wounds.&nbsp; I club him down with the butt of the gun, smashing his face twice before looking up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth man is on me with a knife.&nbsp; I block his thrust with my gun, and the shoulder strap tangles on the blade, tearing it from my hands.&nbsp; I back away, grabbing my own entrenching shovel.&nbsp; We circle each other, stumbling on the blasted rubble covering the small floor.&nbsp; The room is filled with our heavy breathing as we grapple, dancing around each other, feinting and attacking.&nbsp; I look into his eyes and see nothing but the blank, feral stare of determination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lunges again and I throw the shovel, hitting him in the face.&nbsp; He stumbles back, falling down and losing the knife.&nbsp; I land on top of him, pinning his arms while my hand closes on a brick.&nbsp; As I bring it down on his face, he goes limp.&nbsp; I strike again and again, feeling the bones splinter and break, seeing the blood well up from the wounds.&nbsp; I watch from a distance as I strike over and over again, long after the Russian is dead.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is some time before I realize I have survived.&nbsp; I sit back and wipe my bloody hands on the vest of one of the Russians.&nbsp; It is only then that I feel the disappointment. Stalingrad is not finished with me yet.  ********  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The war was a glorious thing to me once.&nbsp; I embraced the excitement and glory, drunk with the speed of our conquest.&nbsp; We made such rapid progress in those first few months, it seemed nothing could stop us from taking Moscow and the rich oil fields of the Ukraine.&nbsp; The greatest effort in those early days was the simple act of walking.&nbsp; We struggled to keep up with the Panzers as they blasted great lanes through the crumbling Red Army.&nbsp; Even the villagers greeted us as saviors at first, happy to be free of the lash of communism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was before the Totenkopf SS began to sterilize the countryside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, they strap grenades to their children and send them to our camps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are within sight of the Volga, here in Stalingrad.&nbsp; For months, we have fought house-to-house, room-to-room.&nbsp; The Russians, so deserving of our contempt in the early days, now fight like some great cast iron beast, unfeeling of pain, unmindful of death.&nbsp; All around us, the city is a flaming ruin, rubble piled upon rubble, streets covered with bodies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle never pauses.&nbsp; They ordeal never ends.&nbsp; There are only more buildings, more rooms, and more death.&nbsp; Many good men have died here.&nbsp; Men with whom I had crossed the steppes, driving the Russians before us.&nbsp; Men whom I would call brothers.&nbsp; We died for each other, holding to the hope that some of us would see our families again one day.&nbsp; Our deaths bought the lives of our friends and brothers, and for them we embraced our fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, there are new men around.&nbsp; Men I will attach myself to out of necessity, never taking the time to know their names.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter.&nbsp; The young recruits were the hardest.&nbsp; They were new to this war, transported in on rail from the Reich, not understanding what this war has become.&nbsp; Those new men insisted on talking.&nbsp; They wanted the comfort of companionship and the safety of friends.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The veterans knew this safety was an illusion, but we didn’t speak of it.&nbsp; These new men died hard, screaming for their mothers or wives, shouting out at the rude betrayal of fate.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that had come to know the truth of Stalingrad died with relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I no longer think about living.&nbsp; My mind is occupied with dying.&nbsp; The months grind on, obliterating our memories of home, and erasing our hopes for life.&nbsp; One night, after the last of my friends died, I burned all of my personal items.&nbsp; I lingered over the photo of Helena and Daniella; my wife and daughter back in Munich, but it went into the fire, along with my hope of survival.&nbsp; I could not bear to be reminded every day of the things that I will loose when I die here.&nbsp; That night, I declared myself dead and accepted my fate.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I no longer remember why I fight, but I continue on.&nbsp; I fight out of joyless habit.&nbsp; I will die from mindless repetition.&nbsp; I know nothing else.  **************  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I am an ammunition bearer.&nbsp; I shoulder my weapon and help the man next to me carry the large steel box.&nbsp; Ahead, three other men wrestle with the heavy mortar.&nbsp; We move down the shattered hallway, heading for the staircase that leads up to the roof of the massive Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory.&nbsp; We step over the decomposing bodies of both Russian and German, locked together in battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down below, thousands of bodies covered the factory work floor, punctuated by the burning hulks of Panzers. &nbsp;We secure the factory by day, only to have the Russians sneak back in at night.&nbsp; They travel through cellars, or they knock holes in the walls and pass through from room to room.&nbsp; An empty room suddenly becomes an enemy gun emplacement, and more men die clearing it out.&nbsp; They are like the tide, and we can’t keep them from finding the cracks in our walls.&nbsp; We kill ten of them for every one of us, and the Russians count that as a good trade.&nbsp; They will drown us in their blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reach the end of the hallway and the mortar team pauses.&nbsp; The lead man opens the stairwell door.&nbsp; The explosion hurls me back and something heavy strikes my head, knocking the helmet away.&nbsp; I collapse on the floor, dazed.&nbsp; In my mouth, I can taste the bitter iron of blood; the taste of this city.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I roll over and look.&nbsp; The three men of the mortar team have been shredded.&nbsp; Parts of bodies are strewn around the narrow hallway and the walls are painted in a fresh coat of blood.&nbsp; The men shielded me from the blast.&nbsp; I run my hands over myself, surprised to find no injury.&nbsp; I recover my helmet, and the bloody smear on its side tells me I was hit by a piece of a man.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I retrieve my gun, checking to be sure that it still functions.&nbsp; The other ammo bearer moans.&nbsp; He has taken shrapnel in the gut.&nbsp; I pull his clothes aside and see the wound is fatal.&nbsp; He will bleed to death before anything can be done for him.&nbsp; I look into his eyes and see the acceptance written there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He manages to reach inside his bloody shirt and pull out his ID tag.&nbsp; He doesn’t have the strength to break the chain, so I do it for him.&nbsp; I tuck the small bit of metal into my pocket without looking at the name.&nbsp; I rise to go when he utters the phrase I was dreading.&nbsp; “Bitte.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look down at him.&nbsp; I consider carrying him, but the reality of my situation gives me no choice.&nbsp; We both know the only option available to us. He nods as I draw my knife.&nbsp; Bullets are precious, and I have a limited supply.&nbsp; I turn him on his side and place one hand on his forehead to steady him.&nbsp; With a quick thrust to the back of the neck, I relieve him of his pain.&nbsp; I wipe the blade on his shirt and prepare to move on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I open the steel ammo box and remove two rounds for the shattered mortar.&nbsp; A few more may fit in my pack, but they are bulky and dangerous.&nbsp; I set out with them in my hands, heading back toward the bunker built into one of the massive cold furnaces.&nbsp; There, I will get a new assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I round the corner and come face to face with a group of Russians creeping down the hallway. &nbsp;We stare at each other for a moment before I react.&nbsp; I hurl one of the mortar shells at them and jump back around the corner.&nbsp; The shell was not armed, but it served its purpose as I hear them shout and scatter.&nbsp; I pull the arming pin on the other shell and slam it against the wall.&nbsp; I count to three and throw it around the corner.&nbsp; The blast throws me down on the floor and I hear the splintering of timbers and the rumbling of collapsed flooring.&nbsp; The dust is thick in the air as the silence descends. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look around the corner and see that the hallway is gone.&nbsp; The entire floor has collapsed, and I see the pile of bodies down below.&nbsp; A few still move, crawling over the dead, cradling broken limbs or gaping wounds.&nbsp; I stand on the edge of the hole and chamber a round in my pistol.&nbsp; I select the men who might survive, and begin shooting them in the head.&nbsp; The work is mechanical, and I finish within a minute.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I turn back to find another passage, I block out the cries of the mortally wounded.&nbsp; They will be quiet soon enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ******************** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The days blur together.&nbsp; The long battles are interrupted by brief interludes of numb sleep.&nbsp; I wonder if I will notice my own death when it comes.&nbsp; God has forsaken all of us in this shattered city.&nbsp; Our ghosts wander the streets at night, turned away from both heaven and hell by His wrath.&nbsp;  Today, I am patrolling streets behind our own lines.&nbsp; When the shots ring out, the adrenaline takes over.&nbsp; I throw myself down against the rubble.&nbsp; Next to me, the flammenwerfer bearer adjusts the tank on his back.&nbsp; The steady flame from the barrel nearly burns me as he rolls over.&nbsp; I cuff him on the shoulder, shoving him away.&nbsp; He mumbles an apology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rise up just enough to peer through a gap in the rubble.&nbsp; A dozen meters away, a small wooden shed blocks our way.&nbsp; I can’t see the sniper, but I know he is there.&nbsp; Three dying squad mates lay twitching in the street behind us.&nbsp; I survey the scene and make a decision.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We move around to the back of the shed.&nbsp; I can’t see any cracks or openings on this side.&nbsp; The sniper can’t see us, but we must move quickly before help comes.&nbsp; My squad mate stands up and douses the dry, wooden shed with a long blast from the flammenwerfer.&nbsp; The wood begins to pop and crackle beneath the onslaught of flames.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the shed begins to burn, I move further around the pile of rubble, gaining a vantage from which to see the door of the shed.&nbsp; The sniper will exit right in front of me, and I am ready to cut him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shed burns for a long time.&nbsp; I motion to my partner to move around on the opposite side of the shed, ready to burn the Russian when he comes out.&nbsp; The shed door opens and a flaming man staggers out into the snow.&nbsp; Even as he burns, he fires his gun at my partner.&nbsp; I shoot him in the back, but he continues to fire as he drops to his knees. The flammenwerfer explodes, engulfing my partner in flames.&nbsp; He runs toward me; a flaming torch of a man.&nbsp; His shrieking tears through me as I roll out of his way.&nbsp; I ignore him, firing again and again into the sniper.&nbsp;  Finally, the Russian collapses onto the snow and I turn my attention to my partner.&nbsp; He is running in small circles, screaming as the flames consume his clothing.&nbsp; I can see he is doomed, so I do the only thing I can.&nbsp; I empty my entire clip into him.&nbsp; He falls to the ground, but the cries of agony continue.&nbsp; I rip open my vest pocket and search for another clip of ammunition.&nbsp; It takes me several seconds of frantic searching to find it. I step up and hold the muzzle close to his head, making sure to finish him.&nbsp; The heat from the flames singes my hands and face.&nbsp; The thick, black smoke carries the taint of burning flesh, and I fear I will never escape the smell. Once again, I find myself alone with the dead.  ******************* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we began another assault.&nbsp; Our leaders tried to inspire us with words about victory, but their voices wavered and their eyes revealed the truth.&nbsp; We have been cut off here in Stalingrad, and the Russians surround the city.&nbsp; We are to fight on, and with our deaths, buy time for our forces to fall back and fortify the lines for the coming counter attack.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am alone.&nbsp; I have been separated from my brothers by the fury of Russian artillery.&nbsp; I sprint from crater to crater as the shells rain down from the heavens.&nbsp; The ground beneath me shakes from the explosions, and I hear the jagged metal as it screams over my head.&nbsp; The barrage behind me makes going back impossible.&nbsp; My only hope is to find shelter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were pressing onward to the Barrikady factory; yet another immense building demanding its toll in blood.&nbsp; The assault faltered as the guns on the other side of the Volga opened up upon us.&nbsp; The Luftwaffe cannot find the batteries in the thick fog, so they are free to expend all they have so carefully hoarded through the months of battle here in the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fear they will let us have the factory and then smash it down around us.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dive into a gully running beside the road and slide down to the bottom on a wave of bloody mud.&nbsp; At the bottom, a cushion of bodies breaks my descent.&nbsp; I lay there for a moment, gazing at the men who died here.&nbsp; Their slack faces reveal little of the agony they endured. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I crawl along the gully, heading back toward the German lines.&nbsp; The artillery hammers the elevated roadway, and seems to be shifting north, away from me.&nbsp; I reach a small stream running beneath the road through a large metal pipe, big enough for two men to walk abreast without stooping.&nbsp; Here is where I can rest a moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dead are piled deep.&nbsp; Here other men have sought shelter, only to find their deaths.&nbsp; I crouch down next to one of them and lean back against the pipe.&nbsp; For the first time in days, I remove my helmet and scratch my head.&nbsp; My hair is matted and filthy, and I realize that it will never be clean again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a fit of disgust, I hurl the helmet away.&nbsp; I am sick of this war, and I wish an end to it.&nbsp; The artillery shifts back toward me and before long the pounding shells begin to bracket both ends of the drainpipe.&nbsp; On either side, I see the eruptions of mud and blood and flesh as the shells dig down into the bloody strata of the city.&nbsp; The ground shakes beneath me, and the great pressure-wave of the explosions tear through my ears.&nbsp; I feel myself screaming, but the echoing rage of Russian ordinance drowns me out.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pounding continues for several seconds, then shifts away to the south.&nbsp; I stand and prepare to move out to the north, before the fire returns, when a small bundle of rags move in front of me.&nbsp; In the flashes of exploding shells, I make out the small form of a girl cowering next to a body.&nbsp; She holds a small sack close to her body and stares at me with cold eyes.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For an instant, I see Daniella. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child starts to back away, and I lean forward.&nbsp; “Ich verletze Sie nicht, mein kleines Mädchen.”&nbsp; She seems to understand me, and hesitates.&nbsp; The explosions recede as the artillery moves farther away, taking this war with it.&nbsp; For a moment, I am just a man trying to comfort a little lost girl.&nbsp; I open my canteen.&nbsp; “Wasser?”&nbsp; I take a sip of the water and hold it out toward her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She moves forward into the light and I can see her gaunt features.&nbsp; Beneath the tattered rags, she is so tiny.&nbsp; Her mouth is smeared with blood.&nbsp; She looks about ten years old.&nbsp; I open a pocket on my vest and pull out a piece of linen to clean her face.&nbsp; She moves closer to me, and I kneel down, teetering as I try to find my balance.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I can move, she springs forward, barreling into me and knocking me on my back.&nbsp; As I try to catch myself, I feel a sharp stinging on my cheek.&nbsp; She leaps on my chest and slashes at my face with a Russian bayonet, nearly as big as she is.&nbsp; I try to shove her away, but she is like a rabid dog, shrieking as she slashes again and again.&nbsp; I take a deep cut on my forearm.&nbsp; In the flashing light, I see the blood and grime smeared all over her face.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without thought, my training takes control.&nbsp; I draw my knife and thrust upward through her chest.&nbsp; The blade catches on her ribs, and I shove harder to make sure I reach the heart.&nbsp; I watch her face spasm above me, and her bayonet falls from her hands.&nbsp; I catch her as she slumps and roll over with her body cradled in my arms.&nbsp; What have I done? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look down at her with tears in my eyes.&nbsp; The hilt of my knife quivers in time with her heartbeat, slowing even as I watch.&nbsp; Her eyelids flutter as her life leaks away.&nbsp; As she dies, I hear her last word barely escape her lips.&nbsp; “Otets”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tears flow down my cheeks as I think of Daniella.&nbsp; The artillery returns, pummeling the ground in great heaving rage, thundering its anger at what I have done.&nbsp; The small pouch tied at her waist has fallen open, and within I see a gnawed human hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have turned little girls into cannibals.&nbsp; I scream my rage and anger over the explosions, matching their fury with my own. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I scream for my daughter in Munich who will never again see her father. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I scream for the little dead girl before me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I scream for all of Russia and the things we have done to her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I scream for one weary soldier in a drainage ditch, who can never be human again.

       urlLink Activists sue to stop random MBTA bag searches    I'm no Constitutional Lawyer, which should be a big relief to Eric, but I don't think this is a good idea on the part of the Civil Rights groups.   Two civil rights groups filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority from randomly inspecting passengers' bags, saying it's an unconstitutional violation of personal privacy.    It would seem that the search is defined as a term of service, just as you are required to wear a shirt or shoes in a store.  You are free not to wear said articles, but then the store is not required to srvice you.  If the MTBA hasn't already done so, they need to get this condition printed upon the tickets or posted in a way to be clear to the consumer.  Just like airlines require a search as a term of the flight, the transit people can and should do the same.  I just don't see a problem here.  No one's rights are being violated if the terms of the contract are established up front.

      So, I watched most of the DNC last night on Fox News (I figured it would cancel it all out).  I was shocked by two things:  Gore using the phrase  urlLink Brown Shirts  to refer to Bush supporters and staff.  How is this not made a big deal of?  Where is the outrage?  If not for Fox News I would not have known of this.  I have also heard that Teresa has made some not so kind remarks about the Kennedy's which are set to be leaked soon, that should be fun.  Also, love him or hate him, Clinton's speech was the best political speech I may have ever heard.  Outstanding.  He could possibly be the best pure "politician" ever.    No wonder they scheduled him as far away as possible from Kerry.

      A few observations from the weekend.  I heard some talking heads on Sunday speculating about the renewed tempo on the abduction of foreigners in Iraq.  We aren't seeing any more Americans being kidnapped, and the thinking is that the insurgents are now going after soft targets.  They are tired of having their butts handed to them by Marines, so they are going to get the unguarded personel of the weaker nations.  This is a good thing, and further evidence that the bad guys are having problems.  Also, I don't believe the bad guys have executed a muslim hostage yet.  I'd rather not see them execute anyone, but it is interesting that the muslims have been spared.  That would actually be in accordance with the Koran....  The History Channel has a new series called  urlLink Decisive Battles .  The notable thing about this series is the technology being used to illustrate the battles - a computer game.  Some years back I discovered what is called the Total War series of computer games, starting with Shogun: Total War.  Later, they came out with Mideivel: Total War, and coming soon is Rome: Total War.  In the TW series of games, you command a large force of ground troops, appropriate for your era.  The game is known for an amazing level of detail, and you can actually watch individual soldiers as they battle in large formations.  Hands down, this is my favorite game.  Anyway, Rome:Total War is the newest in the series, not yet released, and features a new 3D engine for rendering the battle.  The History Channel is using the game engine to illustrate the battles, and what I saw was quite stunning.  Screenshots of the game can be found  urlLink here .  I will actually upgrade my graphics card just to play this game.  The Democratic National Convention starts today.  Yawn.  The only thing I'm curious about is the possibility of terrorism.  Hopefully, nothing bad would happen, but I sort of wish we actually catch something in process.  Perhaps a foiled attack would wake up the Left to the very real war we are fighting.  I doubt it though....it would be part of a Bush plot to Steal The Election.  My dad was in town this weekend, and since he is a Democrat, I couldn't wait to discuss Sandy Berger's pants.  Unfortunately, he flat out refused to discuss it.  I think he's losing interest in politics, since he's pretty much disgusted with his own party.  He's turning into a Zell Miller Democrat.  I guess that's a good thing, but I do miss the heated discussions.    Alas....

A beheaded body has become another mundane report.  Kidnappings and executions in the name of Allah has sunk to the same level as the latest labor dispute in Europe.  Maybe I need to go find the Nick Berg tape again and remind myself what this means, and why we are fighting over there (or maybe not, since some believe that the entire war was strictly for WMDs....never mind that the WMD argument was only trotted out to get the UN onboard, in deference to the multi-national crowd.  It never really mattered, and for the record, I still believe Saddam had them, or was very near building them despite the sanctions.  But that's another post...).

       urlLink THE BELGRAVIA DISPATCH: The Berger Follies: The NYT Has No Shame :   The NYT is spinning Sandy Berger's Pants.   "You see, the main story here isn't mostly about whether/why Berger surrepetitiously stole away with classified documents from 9/11 committee chambers.  No, it's about whether the Justice Department should have clued in the White House regarding the investigation.   The White House declined to say who beyond the counsel's office knew about the investigation, but some administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believed that several top aides to Mr. Bush were informed of the investigation. President Bush himself declined to answer a question Wednesday about whether he had been told, saying: 'I'm not going to comment on this matter. This is a serious matter, and it will be fully investigated by the Justice Department.'   Bush, not Berger, is not answering Qs right now!   I mean, you couldn't make this stuff up folks.

       urlLink Michael Moore to be Feted in Boston   I don't normally link to Newsmax, but this one is pretty much free of spin.      "While in Boston, Moore will be honored by the Congressional Black Caucus and plans to address its membership. This event will take place at 4:00 in the afternoon on Monday, July 26th at the Sheraton Hotel in Boston."   Are we agreed that Michael Moore is a Leftist kook?  If so, then what does that make the Congressional Black Caucus, composed of Congressmen and Senators who happen to be black, and all happen to be democrats?

      Maybe I’m wasting my time, but since Mike didn’t respond to Eric’s questions, I feel I should spend a little bit of time on the old Halliburton lie.  It probably won’t matter to anyone, but it does to me.  I’m linking here to a page on  urlLink Moorewatch.com , consisting of a series of pieces from the National Review and the New York Times (gasp) about the Halliburton mythology.  We’re talking 5,300 words of journalism, so if you want to continue with this idea that Cheney is darkly manipulating things to get contracts to Halliburton, you go right ahead.  Here’s some excerpts, but I encourage you to take ten minutes and read it all.    Last November, the Corps assigned Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR), which has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Halliburton since the 1960s, to do a classified study of potential damage and repairs in the Iraqi oil fields. Contrary to Waxman’s assertion, the work was done under a competitively awarded contract system known as the U.S. Army Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, or LOGCAP.  ….  LOGCAP is, in effect, a multi-year supercontract. In it, the Army makes a deal with a single contractor, in this case Halliburton, to perform a wide range of unspecified services during emergency situations in the future. The last competition for LOGCAP came in 2001, when Halliburton won the contract over several other bidders. Thus, when the oil-field study was needed, Corps officials say, Halliburton was the natural place to turn. “To invite other contractors to compete to perform a highly classified requirement that Kellogg Brown & Root was already under a competitively awarded contract to perform would have been a wasteful duplication of effort,” Corps commander Lt. Gen. Robert Flowers wrote to Waxman in April.  ….  “Only KBR, the contractor that developed the complex, classified contingency plans, could commence implementing them on extremely short notice,” Flowers wrote Waxman. “The timing was driven by Central Command’s operational requirement to have support available in advance of possibly imminent hostilities.” Flowers added that the contract was always intended as a temporary “bridge” to a more permanent contract that would be offered for competitive bidding.  ….  The LOGCAP payment method, known as a cost-plus-award, calls for KBR to be paid its costs plus a profit of 1 percent. According to the General Accounting Office, KBR could also earn “an incentive fee of up to nine percent of the cost estimate, based on the contractor’s performance in a number of areas, including cost control.”  ….  The first LOGCAP was awarded in 1992, as the first Bush administration (including then-Secretary of Defense Cheney) was leaving office. Four companies competed, and the winner was Brown & Root, as it was known at the time (Halliburton changed the name to Kellogg Brown & Root after an acquisition in 1998). The multi-year contract was in effect during much of the Clinton administration. During those years, Brown & Root did extensive work for the Army under the LOGCAP contract in Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia; contract workers built base camps and provided troops with electrical power, food, and other necessities.  In 1997, when LOGCAP was again put up for bid, Halliburton/Brown & Root lost the competition to another contractor, Dyncorp. But the Clinton Defense Department, rather than switch from Halliburton to Dyncorp, elected to award a separate, sole-source contract to Halliburton/Brown & Root to continue its work in the Balkans. According to a later GAO study, the Army made the choice because 1) Brown & Root had already acquired extensive knowledge of how to work in the area; 2) the company “had demonstrated the ability to support the operation”; and 3) changing contractors would have been costly. The Army’s sole-source Bosnia contract with Brown & Root lasted until 1999. At that time, the Clinton Defense Department conducted full-scale competitive bidding for a new contract. The winner was . . . Halliburton/Brown & Root. The company continued its work in Bosnia uninterrupted.  ….  New details are emerging that suggest the energy giant Halliburton did not overcharge the Defense Department for fuel in Iraq  contrary to the claims of critics in Congress and in the field of Democratic presidential candidates.  The Pentagon is investigating allegations that Halliburton overcharged it by $61 million for gasoline and other fuels delivered to Iraq. Halliburton delivered gasoline to Iraq from Kuwait at a price of $2.27 per gallon, while it delivered gas from Turkey for $1.18 per gallon.  ….  But why did the Corps specify that fuel be delivered from Kuwait? The answer appears to lie with the nature of fuel shortages that swept Iraq in the late spring. After the war, the country’s oil refineries were operating far below capacity. Both gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas, which millions of Iraqis use for cooking, were in very short supply.  American officials feared that the shortages might spark civil unrest. Of particular concern was Basra, the city in southern Iraq that had seen increasingly violent expressions of popular anger against coalition forces. According to a source in the Corps of Engineers, in May, Lt. General Ricardo Sanchez, leader of American forces in Iraq, demanded that fuel be supplied to Basra  fast.    If you are still reading, congratulations, and go read the whole thing.  If not, then I’m wasting my time and I’ll stop here.  If prompted, I’m prepared to debate this with Eric or anyone else.  I ENJOY this, so bring it on.

       urlLink The New York Times > Editorials & Opinion   Let's see what the NYT is talking about today on the editorial page.  1).  A free trade issue with Vietnam and China. 2).  Giving insurance salesmen access to the military. 3).  The Illinois election. 4).  The firing of Linda Ronstadt.    Hah.  Where's the pants???  And on Ms. Ronstadt, here's further proof that they don't get it...   This behavior assumes that Ms. Ronstadt had no right to express a political opinion from the stage. It implies - for some members of the audience at least - that there is a philosophical contract that says an artist must entertain an audience only in the ways that audience sees fit. It argues, in fact, that an artist like Ms. Ronstadt does not have the same rights as everyone else.  Perhaps her praise for Mr. Moore, even at the very end of her show, did ruin the performance for some people. They have a right to voice their disapproval - to express their opinion as Ms. Ronstadt expressed hers and to ask for a refund. But if their intemperate behavior began to worry the management, then they were the ones who should have been thrown out and told never to return, not Ms. Ronstadt, who threatened, after all, only to sing.

      More questions about Berger's pants.  It seems that Clinton knew about this all along, based upon his comments on Drudge and other outlets.  Do you think he bothered to tell Kerry?  Do you think Kerry might want to know, if he didn't already?  Would it be useful for Kerry to realize one of his campaign advisors on National Security has 'paper-attracting pants'?  If Kerry has been blindsided by this, then I wouldn't be surprised if the leak came from the Clinton camp.  Kerry's poll numbers have been stronger than expected, and a Kerry win would be the end of Hillary's chances.  Given Clinton's history, is it unreasonable to think this is possible?

      I should make a mention of the Linda Rondstat and Whoopi Goldberg incidents, since they illustrate the long standing differences between the Right and the Left.  In case you haven't heard, Rondstat broke off in the middle of her Vegas act and praised Michael Moore, saying that he preaches the truth and called him a great American.  The audience booed and many left the show.  As a result, the casino owner fired her that night and asked her to vacate the hotel immediately.  Maybe a little heavy handed, but it's his casino.  The ever-lovable Whoopi spouted off a potty-mouth tirade against Bush during a Kerry fundraiser, with Kerry and Edwards in attendance.  Slim Fast decided they didn't want to be associated with Ms. Goldberg, so they canned her the next day.  In both cases, outrage Leftists are invoking the First Amendment.  Not surprisingly, this demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the guarantees of the First Amendment, as well as a fundamental disrespect for the notion of 'private property'.  The First Amendment allows you to say anything you want without fear of persecution (although there are limits imposed by the general welfare clause, such as not being able to shout fire in a theater and all of that).  However, this freedom of persecution does not establish a right to access private property or to require someone else to continue an association against their will.  Does the Left really believe that they should be able to say anything and still force others to provide a stage or hire them to endorse a product?  Note that in both cases, the Federal Government had nothing to do with the consequences of this speech.  These are private citizens/entities exercising their own rights in response to activities they did not appreciate.  The philosophical differences between Left and Right are vast....

Excuse me??  Nice to see the NYT ran the story on page  urlLink A-16 .  A-16?!  Is this NOT news??  I guess it won't be news until they can get a picture of Cheney shoving those docs down Berger's pants when he isn't looking.    The LA Times ran the story under a section called  urlLink 'In Brief' .  Come on, can anyone honestly talk about a 'balanced' media in the face of this crap?  And now the NYT is running a correction about the  urlLink 'Niger'  reference in the State of the Union.  Wow, they just got around to fixing it?  Or is the urge to misquote Bush so undeniable?  Imagine if a Republican had done something this stupid?  And Berger used to be the National Security Advisor!  Was he not clear about the meaning of security?  Was this a routine method of document transportation?  I know when I come home from work, I'm always finding documents in my pants.  Happens all the time.  Sheesh....   Update - Kerry has cut Berger loose as an 'advisor' to his campaign.  But this incident actually occurred six or seven months ago.  How long has Kerry known about this incident?  What did Berger show Kerry?  Why didn't he act on this earlier?  Another Update - From the  urlLink NYT    "Mr. Berger does not want any issue surrounding the 9/11 commission to be used for partisan purposes," Lanny Breuer, Mr. Berger's attorney, told The Associated Press late this afternoon.    Pardon me while I laugh like a constipated Frenchman.     The decision to step aside came after a day in which Republicans zeroed in on the disclosure that Mr. Berger, who was President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, removed classified documents from the National Archives last year.    Republicans are zeroed in on this??  How about normal law abiding Americans concerned that important information is walking out of secured areas in the pants of a man who once held a post that had the word 'Security' in the title??  Is the NYT convinced that only Republicans are worried about obeying the law?   While Democrats had seemed inclined to give Mr. Berger the benefit of the doubt and accept his explanation that the incident with the documents was inadvertent, Republicans were decidedly less charitable.   So violating national security should be met with charity??  Unbelievable.

Next week's much anticipated final report by a bipartisan commission on the origins of the 9/11 attacks will contain new evidence of contacts between al-Qaeda and Iran&#8212;just weeks after the Administration has come under fire for overstating its claims of contacts between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Iraq.   A senior U.S. official told TIME that the Commission has uncovered evidence suggesting that between eight and ten of the 14 "muscle" hijackers&#8212;that is, those involved in gaining control of the four 9/11 aircraft and subduing the crew and passengers&#8212;passed through Iran in the period from October 2000 to February 2001.   If we have strong evidence that Iran is aiding and sheltering Al Qaeda (and I should point out again that the paralyzed guy who turned himself in last week was in Tehran), then would you support a unilateral invasion of Iran followed by the establishment of a western style democracy?  Would you get behind Bush and support it in the face of UN resistance?

       urlLink A Measure of Media Bias   I don't enjoy banding the media bias drum, but when something like this comes along, I feel like it needs to be banged.  This study has been out there for more than a year now, but you probably haven't heard it about it through the major outlets.  What's wrong with the media policing themselves?  Or at least having an honest discussion about their own bias?    "Our results show a very significant liberal bias. All of the news outlets except FOX score to the left of the average member of congress."  All but three news media outlets (Drudge, ABC World News Tonight, and Special Report) were closer to the average Democrat in Congress than to the median member in the House of Representatives.  The average Journalist is less than half as likely to have voted for Bush as the average voter in and around Berkeley, California.  The average journalist is less than a third as likely to have voted for Bush as the average voter in and around Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Journalists' voting habits in 1992 are more than twice as unrepresentative of the public at large as the voting habits of the residents of the most conservative state in the union, Mississippi.  The news outlet with the scores closest to the median member of congress--hence the most CENTRIST news outlet, was the Drudge Report. CBS Evening News was furthest from the center.  The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, USA Today, and CBS Evening News each score closer to the score of the average Democrat in congress than they do to the median.  The New York Times score is twice as far from the congressional center as Fox News.  CBS Evening News scored closer to Senator Ted Kennedy than it did to Joe Biden.     Right now, someone is pushing a documentary striving to illustrate Fox News as a Right wing outfit.  The movie is being used heavily at Democratic fundraisers.  It's interesting that Fox has done several pieces reporting on this film, and asking the question 'does it have any truth to it'.  I've seen them do analysis on their own coverage while dissecting parts of the documentary.  Why doesn't the NYT or CBS do the same thing?  What's wrong with a little introspection?

       urlLink Another dry run?   I can't vouch for the veracity of this story, but it is well worth reading.   The take-off was uneventful.  But once we were in the air and the seatbelt sign was turned off, the unusual activity began. The man in the yellow T-shirt got out of his seat and went to the lavatory at the front of coach -- taking his full McDonald's bag with him.  When he came out of the lavatory he still had the McDonald's bag, but it was now almost empty. He walked down the aisle to the back of the plane, still holding the bag.  When he passed two of the men sitting mid-cabin, he gave a thumbs-up sign.  When he returned to his seat, he no longer had the McDonald's bag.   Then another man from the group stood up and took something from his carry-on in the overhead bin. It was about a foot long and was rolled in cloth.  He headed toward the back of the cabin with the object.  Five minutes later, several more of the Middle Eastern men began using the forward lavatory consecutively. In the back, several of the men stood up and used the back lavatory consecutively as well.   For the next hour, the men congregated in groups of two and three at the back of the plane for varying periods of time. Meanwhile, in the first class cabin, just a foot or so from the cockpit door, the man with the dark suit - still wearing sunglasses - was also standing.  Not one of the flight crew members suggested that any of these men take their seats.

       An addendum to the last post.  &nbsp; It occurred to me yesterday that the Left's criticism of the Bush policies all stem from one fundamental complaint:   Bush isn't a psychic.   Bush should have seen 9/11 coming. Bush should have spent more money on security when he came into office. Bush should have known where Bin Laden was in Afghanistan. Bush should have known that there were no large stocks of WMD, despite what the world intel services were saying. Bush should have known Iraq would take a long time to pacify. It goes on and on, all of it centered on second guessing decisions that were made before the outcome could have been known.   Kedwards talks about what he would have done. How he would have handled it differently, as if that is supposed to be proof of leadership qualities. Maybe Kerry would be a good leader, but this approach isn't sufficient to illustrate that ability. What about those on the Left that predicted ten thousand dead Americans and a one year campaign to take Baghdad? What about the claims from the Left that Saddam would use the WMDs (that they knew all along he didn't have anyway) and take out whole divisions of American soldiers?   Again, I can't imagine being so twisted up that I can't acknowledge that Bush has done a pretty good job given the situation and information he has had to work with. Yes, mistakes have been made, but I don't think any of those mistakes came from malfeasance, a dark desire for power, or the presence of a pentagram beneath the Oval Office carpet. Maybe if Bush was in league with Satan, that psychic ability would be part of the package.   I frequently bash Bush and my own party when they do stupid things. I've praised Clinton on a few occasions. I LIKE Joe Leiberman, despite the 2000 electoral mess and his willingness to sell out his convictions for the #2 spot on the ticket. I'll praise things when I see them, even if it comes from the other side.   All I ask is honesty in our handling of the War on Terror. I ask principled democrats to disavow things like Michael Moore, or comparisons of Bush and Hitler, or Ted Kennedy saying that Abu Ghraib is just like Saddam's practices. We don't need that in a reasoned debate, especially when the stakes are so high.

      Red Vs. Blue   Again, since I haven't been as diligent blogging lately, I've lost the link on this particular observation. More and more, America is divided along the lines of the electoral  urlLink map  of the 2000 election.  Each side even has their own movie now.   The link I lost pointed to a distribution of where Michael Moore's F911 is making the most money, and it lines up with the Blue regions on the electoral map. Similar data was displayed for The Passion of the Christ, and of course, it lined up with the Red regions.   What to make of this polarization? Obviously there are whole books worth of conjecture about why this is so. My concern is in the increasing divergence of our perception of reality, as I had posted about last week. A typical person in the Blue region believes that Bush is dishonest, Iraq is a failure, and the best course of action is to figure out how to get the world to love us. And that's just on foreign policy. Domestically, we have the old Big Government solutions of the 40s coupled with a fundamental distrust of the market and a need for government oversight to assure the prosperity of all.   A typical person in the Red region believes the Iraqi war was more than justified, and our standing in the world isn't quite as important as our resolve to confront those that means us harm. Domestically, they general distrust the government, and would like to see a reduction in government size at various levels.   We both can't be right.   I'm young and relatively blind to the more recent trends of political history when it comes to personal experience. I can go back and read accounts of the last fifty years of politics, and I can see that many of the fundamental questions have not been resolved. Nor are they likely to be solved anytime soon, at least in a manner that forces one side to abandon their ideas. What concerns me is the inability of either side to have an honest debate. There's has always been distortion and mudslinging, but at least there seemed to be honest disagreement about what to do regarding issues, rather then the default assumption that the other side is either evil, stupid, or both. We're becoming two Americas, and not in the way that John Edwards means in his stump speech.   I'm a Red state voter. I am conservative, because I believe conservatism is a good thing, and is the correct way to govern a large collection of people. I believe in our response to Terrorism, and as a matter of fact, I think we should go even farther with our application of force. These perceptions, given the facts at hand, seem the most reasonable to me. I can only imagine abandoning them if some unimaginable evidence surfaced that we're doing the wrong thing, and note the word 'unimaginable'. So I find myself entrenched in a position I can't imagine leaving, yet I look at the other side in the mirror image world and wonder 'why can't they wake up?'. I'm sure they say the same thing about me.   I can't abandon my beliefs. I can't move to the mushy middle and try to pretend that both sides have merit when I see so very little on the other side of the fence that is worth defending. I can't be one of these so called high minded moderates who seem to enjoy not having any beliefs in anything, unless it is a belief in relativism. If two people are arguing about whether or not a house is on fire, it isn't 'principled' to say that 'the house could be on fire, but maybe it isn't'. So I can't embrace the middle, and the Left is the opposite of everything I believe.  &nbsp; What do I do?   I remain a Red Stater. And I'll continue to look at the other side like they are from another planet, so long as they refuse to embrace the bulk of evidence that they are wrong. I imagine they will pretty much do the same. Where do we go from here?   Is  urlLink secession  a bad thing?

       urlLink John Edward's Tax Shelter   Via Iraq NOW.  I want to be fair when it comes to criticism of the Kedwards ticker, and this attack on John Edwards is not valid.  Edwards has been accused of sheltering his income in a way to avoid paying $600,000 in 'taxes'.  In fact, all that Edwards did is incorporate his business as an S Corporation, which is a standard practice in professional practices.  An S Corporation provides a liability shield on personal assets, and also allows 'pass through taxation', meaning that the corporation does not pay taxes on dividends, so Edwards takes his compensation and then pays taxes as an individual.  This way, Edwards doesn't have to pay Medicaid taxes on dividends.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with this.  It's smart, and the right thing to do.  I'd rather see us be fair to Edwards on this one and hammer him on legitimate issues.

      Some thoughts.  I waited too long to link to a news site, but most of you have seen the surrender of the 'spiritual advisor' to Bin Laden giving himself up under the Saudi amnesty plan.  There are a few things about this that I find interesting, beyond the obvious glee at bagging another bad guy, even if he wasn't an active terrorist.  1).  This guy appeared in a video with Bin Laden in December 2001, where he praised Bin Laden on the 9/11 strike.  They gloated together for some time.  2).  This guy is paralyzed from the waist down, confined to a wheel chair.  3).  He turned himself in to the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, Iran.    Now, if Bin Laden is hanging out in the Afghan mountains through late 2001 and early 2002, how does this paralyzed elderly man get to a meeting with Bin Laden?  Strap him to a mule?  Or is it likely that Bin Laden was or is hanging out in the outskirts of Tehran?    What seems likely?  And by the way, I just noticed that this is post number 1,200 in the history of this blog.  I don't know if I should be proud or disturbed.

But based on one op-ed declaring 16 words spoken by the president a lie, he transformed himself into an instant celebrity and, for a while, it seemed, a contender for power within the chien-mange-le-chien world of foreign policy. That dream has now probably evaporated. It is hard to see how a President John Kerry would now want Wilson in his inner circle. But if he desired to return to Gabon or Niger I, for one, would not be among those opposing him.    Joe Wilson is going to be a huge factor in the campaign if Kerry doesn't publicly rebuke any connections with Wilson.

      A few things going on here...  Blogging has been very light lately, and I hope to get back to my usual volume.  I am grateful for the two or three people who do read this, and I hope I can continue to entertain or anger you depending on your particular views.  I feel as if I am about to navigate out of a long and dark storm at work.  I can see the light on the horizon, and the waves are subsiding as we get closer to Emancipation Day - Wednesday July 14th is the final day I will have to deal with a particular person here.  I regret that things have reached this point, but based upon all that I've heard regarding her ability to interact with integrity, this isn't entirely my fault.  The important thing is I will be free from a great source of stress and unhappiness, even as I wish her well on her new job.  This is one of those situations where the magnitude of the unhappiness isn't obvious until it is removed, so my disposition in general has improved remarkably.  I returned to hockey last night, starting another 8 game season.  Unfortunately, we lost in overtime.  The teams have been mixed this season, so I had to face a few of my old team mates, who seemed to have a good understanding of my weaknesses based upon how they were exploited.  The humidity on the rink last night could best be described as 'Soul Rending', and I think I'm still dehydrated twelve hours later.  It's just going to get worse from here on, so if blogging suddenly ceases, you know what will happen.  Jeopardy-boy racked up $52,000 last night, tying his previous high score in a relentless display of knowledge.  He should pass $1 million tonight, I think.  Maybe it's getting dull to some, but I love watching him crush the enemy, drive them before him, and hear the lamentations of their women.   More later...

       urlLink www.AndrewSullivan.com - Daily Dish   Oh man, this is huge.  You all remember Joe Wilson last year with the Yellowcake-Niger-Iraq thing.  Remember BUSH LIED?  The outing of his wife as a CIA 'operative'?  Wilson claimed that his mission to Niger uncovered proof that the yellowcake claim was a lie, and then claimed that Bush retaliated by outing his wife.  Well....   Wilson last year launched a public firestorm with his accusations that the administration had manipulated intelligence to build a case for war. He has said that his trip to Niger should have laid to rest any notion that Iraq sought uranium there and has said his findings were ignored by the White House.   Wilson's assertions -- both about what he found in Niger and what the Bush administration did with the information -- were undermined yesterday in a bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report.   The panel found that Wilson's report, rather than debunking intelligence about purported uranium sales to Iraq, as he has said, bolstered the case for most intelligence analysts. And contrary to Wilson's assertions and even the government's previous statements, the CIA did not tell the White House it had qualms about the reliability of the Africa intelligence that made its way into 16 fateful words in President Bush's January 2003 State of the Union address.      This is melting down  urlLink all  over  urlLink the place .   urlLink Here  too.    This is huge.

      I'm a little worn out by political news today.  I was chatting with Mike last night, and the whole weight of this campaign seemed to come crashing down on me.  It's increasingly clear that we will never have a landslide election again, at least for a generation or more.  It seems that all elections are now destined to be close, as each side is fully entrenched, and no real debate happens anymore.    Don't get me wrong - I endorse the two party system as the best possible way of running the nation.  A parliamentary system of factions coming together long enough to govern before dissolving in rancor is not the way to go.  But it is clear that we have reached a point of irreconcilable differences between the two sides.  And I find that sad.  Particularly when we contemplate the magnitude of the challenge before us.  The crater of the World Trade Center, for a moment, looked like a scar that would bring us together with a common purpose.  Now, that crater has just been turned into an amphitheater, where both sides gather to hurl invective at one another.  It is the cusp of the fracture that is running through the country, and that frightens and amazes me.    I have honestly tried to understand those that say, to various degrees, that the WOT is unwinnable, should not be fought, should not be widened to Iraq, or should only be pursued with other nations that are clearly intending to block us on this.  I have tried to remain open to the arguments, but the stacks upon stacks of hard evidence limit my ability to seriously examine the flights of fancy of the entrenched Left.  Just as they believe I am a brainwashed zombie, I am now looking at them as aliens from another planet at best, and mentally damaged children at worst.  How can people cling to the idea that either Bush Knew, Bush Lied, Bush is Evil, or Bush is In Bed With Terrorists?  How can someone make the principled argument that Iraq is a failure in the face of so much evidence that things are going quite well there, or how can they ignore the historical precedent of occupation in Japan and Germany, with the same sort of insurgency and difficulties?  How can people blind themselves to history when the stakes are so high?  The other side can try to make the same argument about my positions, but for the life of me, I can't understand where they are coming from.  I can't comprehend a chain of events that suggests America is at fault, or a strong response is wrong, or that the establishment of freedom in another part of the world is wrong, immoral, or simply not our problem.  In the words of  urlLink Tony Blair ...    And I know it's hard on America, and in some small corner of this vast country, out in Nevada or Idaho or these places I've never been to, but always wanted to go...   I know out there there's a guy getting on with his life, perfectly happily, minding his own business, saying to you, the political leaders of this country, "Why me? And why us? And why America?"   And the only answer is, "Because destiny put you in this place in history, in this moment in time, and the task is yours to do."    This   is   our task.  And I believe we should have honest debate how to go about it.  We should have honest discussion about the mechanics of war, the targets, the timing and so forth.  Instead, we are consumed with a gleeful desire to see our efforts fail, in the name of political gain.  In the months before the Iraqi War, we HAD a good debate on going to war, but once war is entered, the time for that debate has passed, and we must focus on making it work - not trying to see it fail so one can point to one's earlier objection.  We should be asking the question - what next?  We should be debating the need to strike Iran or Syria, instead of being dishonest about the occupation, the justification of war, and the ever growing evidence of WMD programs in Iraq.    This is an issue that goes beyond traditional politics.  If Clinton had been in office on 9/11 and he had been the strong one in the face of GOP resistance, I'd vote for him.  Nothing else matters at this point in time, and despite my issues with Bush, I see him not as the best man, but as the man defending the best ideas.  I don't give a crap about his affiliation, his social policies, and his economic policies, many of which I don't like.  This is a single issue election.  Let's be honest.  On 9/12/01, how many of you thought that we would go 34 months and counting without another attack on US soil?  Yet 40%+ of Americans think we are losing the War on Terror, or at best, not engaging it properly.  Where is the honest introspection?  Have we made mistakes in the War on Terror?  Of course we have.  We've blown some calls.  Iraq didn't have as much as we thought, but I believe we acted with honor in our misunderstanding of the true capability.  The WORLD thought Saddam had more, and I still believe that we don't yet have a good understanding of his true capabilities even now.  Abu Ghraib?  Yes, that was a mess.  Poor PR?  Absolutely.  It hasn't all been roses, but to paint these errors as evidence of utter failure is simply beyond my ability to comprehend.    The differences seem too great to breach.  How do you have a reasonable discussion with people who refuse to believe facts, or choose to embrace the lies of Michael Moore or the New York Times?  And how do you deal with it when the stakes are so very high?  I'm just worn out.

       urlLink CNN.com - Reporter gets inside look at insurgency - Jul 7, 2004 :   I'm not quite sure what I think about this.  My first instinct is to stand up for journalism and their freedoms (even if they don't exercise responsibility).  But then later, I begin to wonder if the bad guys should have this kind of access to media channels.  Yeah, I know there isn't much that can be done to stop it, so I'm reduced to forming an opinion about a journalist who would serve as such a conduit.     "'This video is straight from the mujahedeen,' journalist Michael Ware said as he viewed the tape at a hotel in Baghdad. 'This is the Blackwater killings. They talk about planning it. I can't believe this.' Ware, an Australian reporter working for TIME magazine, is walking a professional knife-edge, an unlikely go-between for anti-Western militants and the media."   The terrorists are becoming more and more media savvy, and by providing these tapes, they demonstrate an understanding of what moves an average Westerner.  Just as they calculated correctly on Spain's response to 3/11, they think they've got a handle on what makes an American react.    So should we be helping them in this way?  Is this responsible journalism?  Or is it the same as the non-stop Abu Ghraib pictures inciting more and more hatred?  I'm not sure I'm ready to render an opinion on this one.

       urlLink CNN.com - Review: A ponderous 'King Arthur'? - Jul 6, 2004   This one is completely senseless, but in reading this movie review yesterday, I couldn't stop laughing.  It is a tired but true cliche that in Hollywood, all movies must be pitched in terms of other movies.  Things are always described as a mating of two or three other concepts in order to get the suits to understand the concept in under eight seconds.  Well, this review is a good example.     "King Arthur" was directed by Antoine Fuqua, and resembles his earlier film "Training Day" in the visceral, gritty nature of its battles. It was written by David Franzoni, and resembles his earlier film "Gladiator" in its manly-manness and its obsession for historical lore.  ...  If "King Arthur" brings to mind any previous film that Bruckheimer produced, it's "Black Hawk Down." Both share the same cinematographer, Slawomir Idziak, and at times share a similarly bleached-out, grainy look.   ...  But Knightley continues to prove herself a versatile young actress: She can do comedy ("Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"), she can do romance ("Love Actually"), she can be young and fresh in a girl power movie ("Bend It Like Beckham").   ...  Winstone, so excellent in "Sexy Beast," here provides sporadic, much-needed comic relief as a knight whose girlfriend has given birth to so many of their children, they've assigned them numbers rather than names.  ...  And Owen, so suave in the excellent noir hit "Croupier," provides weight, intelligence and heroism to go along with his dark good looks.   OK, maybe it is only funny to me.  But reviews like this make me long for the days of  urlLink Paul Tatara.   And speaking of Tatara, here's a good  urlLink interview  of the funniest reviewer ever to work at CNN.

      Early morning quote from T.E. Lawrence about radical Muslims from 1922.  Very applicable 80 years later and describes a cycle we are going through...  "The Wahabis, followers of a fanatical Moslem heresy, had impressed their strict rules on easy and civilized Kasim. In Kasim there was but little coffee-hospitality, much prayer and fasting, no tobacco, no artistic dalliance with women, no silk clothes, no gold or silver head ropes or ornaments. Everything was forcibly pious or forcibly puritanical. It was a natural phenomenon, this periodic rise at internals of little more than a century, of ascetic creeds in Central Arabia. Always the votaries found their neighbor's beliefs cluttered with inessential things, which had become impious in the hot imagination of their preachers. Again and again they had arisen, had taken possession, soul and body, of the tribes, and had dashed themselves to pieces on the urban Semites, merchants, and concupiscent men of the world. About their comfortable possessions the new creeds ebbed and flowed like the tides or the changing seasons, each movement with the seeds of early death in its excess of rightness. Doubtless they must recur so long as the causes -- sun, moon, wind, acting in the emptiness of open spaces, weigh without check on the unhurried and unencumbered minds of the desert dwellers." --T.E. Lawrence, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom (1922)

      I just saw Todd's post from August 6th. I don't know how I missed it with those big yellow letters saying "WHAT WAS HE THINKING?!?!" along the top of it.  Todd was referring to John Kerry's quote: "I believe I can fight a [...] more sensitive war on terror [...]"   Here's a little snippet of Todd's thoughts on this quote:  Todd:   Regardless of what he meant, does he really want to tie the words 'sensitive' and 'war' together in one neat little bundle? Are the American people interested in being 'sensitive' as we try to protect our way of life? Keep talking John. I thought Bush had the monopoly on entertaining speech.   Well, not to worry Todd. The president took hold of that monopoly the very next day:   "Now in terms of the balance between running down intelligence and bringing people to justice obviously is -- we need to be very  sensitive  on that." --G.W. Bush, August 7, 2004.  And, before Mike calls me out on it,  urlLink here's the source .  I'll also add this Bush quote as a comment in that post. I just wanted to make sure you saw it.

       urlLink OpinionJournal - Featured Article   Stem Cell Research  You probably have heard and may think (as I did) that Laura Bush and the Bush administration wants to ban embryonic stem cell research. This is plainly not the case as this editorial shows.   It seems all that Bush wants to prevent is the growing of embryos for the purposes of harvesting them for stem cells. I disagree with his reasons for this, but I can accept a compromise that uses the already destroyed embryos for research.  This is the future of medicine, and I'm heartened immensely to learn that we are forging ahead in this field. I dream that one day we will be free of cancer, alzheimers, and a host of other ailments. Perhaps it is too much to dream, and the taxpayers should spend the money on paying unwed, unfit mothers to have babies.  What do you think about this issue? I say there is nothing wrong with paying women to grow a fetus to be used as medical material. I know this sounds wrong in some way, but it seems a logical outgrowth of the pro-choice position. Yes, I am pro-choice. The only condition I have is that an arbitrary stop point must be legally enforced as to when an embryo becomes a US citizen. Until then it is a part of the woman's body.  Back to the "Stem Cell Ban." Do you see how the Government's involvement in this issue (as funding research or not) has made progress less likely? Since they have been willing to fund it, they control it. Different politcal whims and expediencies could put an end to this promising new field. If the government obeyed the COnstitution, they would never been involved with this at all. Provate firms would pour money into it and breakthroughs would be more likely. Instead we have edicts from on high telling us what we can and can not research.   The government is not the answer to all of life's problems!

       urlLink The American Spectator   This blurb can be found at the bottom of the page.   "According to a Kerry campaign source, senior campaign advisers tasked two Washington-based campaign staffers to vet the recently published Unfit for Command.  'The purpose was to compare what that book had with what we had on file from Senator Kerry,' says the campaign source, who said that the research project developed more than 75 instances where Kerry's recollections, previous remarks, or writings conflicted with the book's reporting.   'We took some of the most glaring examples, like the Christmas in Cambodia story, and presented them to senior staff, and we assume that those things were put in front of Senator Kerry,' says the source. 'We haven't heard a word about it. All we were told is that it was being taken care of.'  The campaign source said that the book was not considered a 'serious' problem for the campaign, because, ' the media wouldn't have the nerve to come at us with this kind of stuff,'  says the source.  'The senior staff believes the media is committed to seeing us win this thing , and that the convention inoculated us from these kinds of stories. The senior guys really think we don't have a problem here.'"   Nice....no bias though...not at all.

The longer Sadr is alive, the more radicals flock to his cause, streaming into Najaf and mixing it up with US Marines (usually that's not the healthiest thing to be doing).  Perhaps we've let Sadr hang around to serve as the lightning rod, drawing the bad guys out into open conflict.  They've invested heavily in Sadr's viability as an alternative to the Provisional Government, and they're going to fight to keep him going.  Crazy like a fox?

The mission was meant to mark the return of the UN presence in Iraq after a year's absence and help organize and monitor national elections in January 2005. ....

They didn't give our troops all the equipment - the body armor and the armored Humvees and things they need and deserve."   'Other countries'?  I guess England is now one of our colonies.  Did France and Germany merge under the new title Other Countries?  Interesting...   Kerry: I can guarantee that … within my first term, I will have a substantial reduction in troops [in Iraq], yes.  Stripes: Is 17,000 [troops] enough in Afghanistan?  Kerry: No.  Stripes: Would you put more Americans in there first? While your diplomacy works?  Kerry: No, I’d like to expand the NATO presence there, and I’d like to expand other countries’ involvements. But I do think that this administration is diverting from the real war on terror, which was in Afghanistan against al-Qaida, to Iraq, and I think it’s cost us dearly.   France already vetoed NATO presence in Afghanistan.  Is Kerry just going to ask nicer?   Stripes: Increasing end strength, even the 40,000 soldiers that you’re talking about, that takes time. We have a readership of young troops in the field right now, and I think they want to know what you’re going to do immediately to help their situation.  Kerry: I will seek a much greater level of both NATO and other-nation involvement in the training of Iraqi troops and Iraqi security [forces]. We’ll provide greater Iraqi security on the ground and reduce the burden on our own troops … so it’s not an American occupation. And that will greatly reduce the risk to the soldiers in Iraq.   Uh, France also vetoed using NATO to train Iraqi troops.  Again, ask nicer?  I thought our policy wouldn't be held hostage to other nation's interests?  Elect Kerry - because the French will listen to him?

      OK, long post coming (surprised?).  First, I'm going to start continuing what I consider the best thread of the day with Danny to a new entry at the top of the Blog each morning.  It's difficult to follow the comment threads as they drift downward to the bottom of the Blog.  And I'm really pleased with some of Danny's answers, because I think we're getting closer to that root I've been seeking.  Addressing Danny directly, let me say a few things.  I'm not here to set you up, or try to trap you in a logic puzzle.  I'm not seeking out inconsistencies as a means to annihilate your entire platform.  I'm not here to 'defeat' you.    I really want to understand the core of your beliefs, and I appreciate the fact that you have came out and said, on one thread, that you weren't sure of the answer.  I'm not always sure either, but I think exploring these uncertainties serves a few valuable functions.  Notably, beliefs should be challenged, because it either exposes a flaw or strengthens them through a rational, well thought out defense.  I don't really care which way we go here, as both are worthy pursuits.  So I want to keep prodding your replies, as well as my own, in an attempt to find the cracks and see how that changes our views on issues.  So keep that in mind as we go back and forth, at least with me.    Why am I so interested?  The answer might surprise you.    As late as 1990, I was just like you.  I was a rabid leftist.  I hated Reagan.  I remember being so depressed when Dukakis lost.  Kennedy was a great man.  I thought Ollie North should burn in hell (although I never could articulate why).  I was way out there on the left, and couldn't ever imagine how someone could be so twisted as to believe in the conservative movement.  So I see some of myself in your positions, and I'm really curious about your internal logic and consistency.  Sometime we can talk about my own transition to where I am now, but I'd rather kick some of these things around and see where they go.  And again, please don't feel like it's a trap.  If you change your mind on an earlier statement, that's fine!  It's the point of the exercise.  I really want this to be a positive conversation - no one 'wins', we're just talking.  That being said, there are a couple of things I'd like to lay out for more conversation.   Well, I'm really not the best to explain this. I'm not entirely sure what all the president is supposed to do to encourage job growth. However, Bush has given tax breaks to companies that export jobs out of the United States. Kerry has stated that, if elected, he'd overturn these tax breaks and start offering tax incentives to companies that keep more of their labor force in the U.S.A. What does this mean? Bush is discouraging domestic job growth while Kerry is suggesting that we encourage domestic job growth. As a freshman in college, I'd be happy to know that the man running our country was working to increase my chances for employment, rather than the alternative.   A wise person recently pointed out that the only real flaw in capitalism is the illiquid nature of labor.  Capital and money can flow where they are needed almost overnight, while labor, in the form of human lives, requires a bit more effort to deploy and change as the economy alters.  I acknowledge this as a limitation, but I see it as more of a problem in culture than a problem in application.  We are slow to let go of industry that no longer offers a competitive advantage to our economy, and this slowness is a result of the inconvenience to the workers displaced.  Speaking from the perspective of a healthy macro economy, I agree that we should not attempt to hold on to jobs that can be done elsewhere for cheaper.  If a good or service can be obtained for a cheaper price, lowering the cost and making said good or service more widely available due to this lower price, then this is a good thing.  And while you can take that to an immediate extreme and say that no one has a job so no one can afford the product, the economy rarely works in that way.  As an example, at one time we made almost all of the steel in the world.  We had the skills and labor to do so at a rate that couldn't be beat by other nations.  That isn't true anymore, but we have replaced those types of jobs with higher technology applications.  It's bad for the steel worker, sure.  But all labor must face the possibility, the reality, that new skills must be acquired.  While it isn't always reasonable to expect a 30 year steel worker to morph into a clean room worker in a medical device plant, the inconvenience does not alter the reality of economics.  It isn't always possible to hang on to industries that are no longer an advantage in terms of labor and cost.  In the big picture, we are healthier for moving from older technologies to new industry.  How many telephone operators are employed in the US?  Typists?  As a nation, we are better off in the long run.  The recent pain of these transitions is more of a function of the pace of technology.  In the past, it took us a whole working career to transition from agriculture to manufacturing.  Most people could squeeze out their working lives in their job, and the younger force coming up would take on the new industry.  Manufacturing to Information Technology was a much faster transition, catching a lot of people in the middle of their career.  Now these transitions are coming in the span of a few years, displacing people at a faster rate.  The required adaptation of labor is harsher now, and we must all be ready to change lives two or three times in our working career.  So I'm wondering, beyond the idea of creating tax incentives for retaining domestic jobs, how does this help the nation as a whole?  If Mexico can build a consumer electronic for $3, and we can do it for $4, how does offering a tax incentive affect the final consumer price of said item?  Should the consumer be asked to pay more to retain a job that no longer makes economic sense?  Again, I'm not attacking you or your idea here.  I want to understand your thinking.  My perspective on this, given the difficulty in making labor liquid, is that there is opportunity in shedding these jobs that no longer make sense.  Again, speaking on the macro perspective, a depressed pool of labor breeds opportunity for new products and new industry.  For example, if I have invented a product, but I cannot afford to take the plunge and hire some people to build it when the going labor rate is $20, then my product doesn't take off.  If a plant shuts down in my area, I may find some people willing to do it for $15, and suddenly I can afford to hire a few guys to make the product work.  If I have a good product, it could take off and I'm hiring twenty, fifty, a hundred people.  Wages go up to retain good labor.  Efficiencies increase, allowing me to divert money to new applications, resulting in even more jobs at a higher wage.  This is how the computer came about, or software publishers get started.  Displacement results in people willing to try something new, which can grow into something better.  The capitalism axiom of creative destruction applies to outsourcing.  Yes, again it is hard on the worker, but new industry breeds security, while dying industries rarely can be saved.  Of course my example is intended in general terms, from the macro perspective.  And this segues into my question about Gates vs. The Mother.  First, I should make it clear that I do admire and respect what she did for the poor over there.  No doubt about it, I could never do it, and she deserves praise.  However in terms of actual benefit for humanity (as opposed to Seattle residents vs. Calcutta residents) I think Gates is hands down the more useful human being.  You said that if Gates hadn't done it, then someone else would have done it.  Okay, same for the Mother.  Let's talk about the Gates persona vs. the Mother Teresa persona.  Someone would have done both tasks, but that doesn't change my discussion about which task is better for humanity.  You've obviously grasped the thrust of my argument - job creation, but it does go a little deeper.  Not only has Gates actions created jobs, but those workers went on to create products that have fundamentally altered the way business is done.  The effect of their work has decreased the price of about every product imaginable, through the streamlining of distribution models, the efficiency of cash transaction, and the multiplication of R&D efforts in about every product out there.  These second and third order effects have reduced cost, increased output, and raised standards of living for just about all Americans, and a good chunk of the world.  So in those terms, I'm not sure what you mean when you say that Gates has done 'no good'.  How is good defined?  Improving the lives of others?  Sure, Mother Teresa helped ease suffering for an astonishingly poor people, but her actions did not create self-sustaining conditions that offered a way out of blinding poverty in India.  She couldn't do that, because that wasn't her purpose.  The people she tended to do not have access to the means to improve their fundamental situation, and her actions did not address this shortcoming directly.  And that isn't her fault directly.  She was more concerned about immediate pain, and didn't really address the cause of such pain.  So can you clarify your criteria for good vs. bad?    And that brings me back to outsourcing.  Lets go to India, the turf of Mother Teresa and ask some questions.  Indians are figuring out how to turn the one commodity they have, brains, into a product that will attract capital and elevate their standard of living out of poverty.  They have entered the world economy, peddling their people as phone workers.  This is a real attempt at addressing the poverty plaguing their nation.  By all the rules of Free Trade, they have the right to do this.  Would you deny them this opportunity?  Which should they have - ten more Mother Teresa's holding their hands as they die, or access to a job sector that can provide food, education, better housing and hope for a future?  Which is the moral choice for India?  I look forward to a good conversation about all of this.

      My movie odyssey.  Saturday morning dawned with nothing much for me to do, so I decided it might be a good time to get in some movies that I've been wanting to see.  Since most everything on my list didn't interest Diane, I decided to go by myself and just do a marathon of matinee showings out in Maumee, Ohio.  The first thing I did was apply to the Department of Justice for a travel permit, in accordance with the draconian PATRIOT act and the martial law that had been imposed in a Bushian attempt to control our lives.  After swearing allegiance to Mein Fuhrer, permission was granted for me to drive across town.  The barricades and roadblocks were easily negotiable, as I am a white man - a member of the privileged class.  Upon arriving at the theater, I decided to start with a 10:40 showing of I, Robot.  I had fairly low expectations for this film, but I decided to view it anyway since I did love the Asimov story, and was curious about what they had done to it.  I noticed no interest in F911, but that might be due to the machine gun emplacement at the theater doors, along with the Republican hate squads on the prowl for anyone even looking a little liberal - more stifling of dissent!  After sitting through several public service announcements, and reciting the PATRIOT Act mandated Pledge to Our Savior, the best part of any movie going experience started - the trailers!  If you are like me, this really is the purpose of seeing a movie.  Each upcoming trailer is a small thrill, like a present to be unwrapped.  You don't know what is going to start rolling after that green or red frame displaying the rating, and as Mark had said earlier, the previews are so much better than the resulting film.  Several average movies paraded by, none really getting my attention.  Until  urlLink this  hit the screen.  This has got to be one of the best trailers I have seen in many years.  If there had been a credit card machine embedded in the seat, I would have purchased tickets right there and then.  I couldn't wait to hand my money to someone.  I'm becoming more and more of a fan of Asian cinema, and this fulfills all the criteria of a good Asian movie.  The visuals are stunning and the violence stylized.  The plot might suck, but I would still be happy if the film delivers what the trailer promises.  Watch the whole thing, to the very end.  I Robot actually surpassed my expectations by NOT being an utter pile of garbage.  It was still mostly bad, but not mindlessly bad.  It had that Minority Report feel in terms of the technology - clean, functional lines and a dependence on computers even when a simple 'on' button would be better.  The plot conventions are typical of Hollywood, where no one actually designs anything while thinking about what might go wrong.  No Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in the future.    "Gee, what if we have to shut it down?  The off switch is suspended 30 stories in the air reachable only by narrow gantries and a switch guarded by the very thing we might want to shut down someday."  "Be quiet, and make the gantries more flimsy."  I Robot was a wonderful story about racism and the definition of life.  I Robot the movie had a few moments where they could have really explored racism, especially when the two major cops were both black.  Instead, they squandered a real nice chance to explore the issues that make Science Fiction such a nice medium for turning our world on it's head so we can see if from another angle.  Instead, we get flash and bang, guns and bullets, and poetic scenes of Will Smith flying through the air while pumping lead into a moving target a la Neo.  Too bad.  After this film, I received permission from a Homeland Security agent to leave the theater and grab a quick lunch before returning for a showing of Collateral.  The preview cycle for Collateral was very good, and I got a second viewing of the Hero trailer, mentioned above.  Once again, I felt like waving some cash around and begging someone to give me a ticket.  A mediocre trailer for Alexander offered nothing more than an instant of Alexander on a horse facing off with a mounted elephant - a great image, but gone too fast.  It's an Oliver Stone film, so I'm sure Alexander travels to Viet Nam and is ultimately killed by plague introduced by the CIA.    Another 'new' movie (to me) was Suspect Zero, staring Ben Kingsley.  If you've seen Sexy Beast and House of Sand and Fog, then Kingsley automatically earns ticket money from me, at least until he makes something bad.  He plays a remote viewer (to reach Art Bell, west of the Rockies dial 1-800....) who decides to take our serial killers on his own.  So he's running from other agents while slaying his way across the country in various colorful ways.  Again, I don't know if it is any good, buy you have Kingsley looking menacing and killing people while speaking with a slight British accent.  What more do you need?    I had mentioned on Friday that I had high expectations for Collateral.  Michael Mann is a great director who isn't afraid to let a story develop at it's own pace.  I'm not ready to declare Collateral as the major film of the year so far, but it was VERY good.  If you are old enough to remember Miami Vice, you'll see similarities here.  Mann lets the camera roll while the characters are doing what normal people do, and you get a sense of normalcy and everydayness that works well.  There are a couple of long sequences where we follow the cab as it drives around LA, accompanied by whatever music is appropriate (electric, jazz, classical), all the while getting a sense of the disconnectedness of LA and the characters from one another.  It's like a small music video that really sets the mood.  We see Cruise and Fox in the cab through rain drizzled windows, out of focus as they drive by.  A sense of regular life, which makes the events of the film more interesting.  It builds a sympathy that is believable, since it is so easy to reflect on your own quiet, boring moments waiting on something to happen while driving across town, or just relaxing.  It works so well.  And Mann has structured the film like a bunch of smaller films all related by certain themes.  Each extended scene plays like a self contained story, exploring a specific aspect of the characters.  You watch Fox absorb some of the hardness of Cruise while at the same time repulsed by what his passenger does for a living.  You also get a longing sense from Cruise, a man who denies life, and we wonder why.  It's nice to see two actors act, just sitting in a cab talking about an improbable situation with a minimum of hysteria.  The dialogue is really good, but a little hard to hear at times.  My only complaint is about a shootout in a nightclub, where I'm not entirely clear about who represents whom.  I can't tell the cops from the bad guys from the other bad guys.  It doesn't ruin it, but it takes me out of the scene a little when I'm trying to figure out who just got capped.  There is also another minor thread following a couple of cops trying to sort things out, but it seems out of place in the film, and I suspect editing disposed of a lot of footage.    Collateral is a film that requires your attention.  You need to pay attention, relax, and let it happen.  I think you'll find your time rewarded.  This isn't a film to half-watch on DVD while your kids play in the next room.  You need focus.  I nearly bought a ticket to the Manchurian Candidate, but Diane called and asked me to come home.

      I'd like to pursue this question, because I think it drives to the heart of each person's philosophy.  Which person has done more good in the world - Mother Theresa or Bill Gates?  And to make it easier, I'll exclude all the charity work of the Gates Foundation when making this determination.  Obviously, because I'm asking when the answer appears so obvious to most, you can correctly assume I'm all for Gates over the good Mother.  I think we've discussed this before, but I'd like to go over it with Danny, to get to those core values.

      On July 30th, Mike asked me, "Why can't we all agree on the Facts? [...] Facts like the improving economy."  Here are a few tidbits:  urlLink In Blow to Bush, Only 32,000 Jobs Created in July  by David Leonhardt at the New York Times on August 7, 2004.  The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indices are at 2004 lows. The Nasdaq has fallen 9.1%, the S&P 2.8%, over the past 7 months. Source:  urlLink Bulls are unfazed by long decline  by Adam Shell and Matt Krantz at USA TODAY on August 5, 2004. That fact seems to conflict with the unsourced "fact" you stated. Care to elaborate, Mike?      *As the print edition of this USA Today article asked, "In face of new lows, is it optimism - or denial?" Ask yourself that question, Mike, and get back to me on what you decide.

      A continuation of  urlLink this thread.   Mike says: I'm flabbergasted. Todd and I offer reason and facts and all you say is "Bush ignored briefings."  No, Mike, if you look a little deeper into all the posts I've made in this thread, you'll probably notice that the total word count vastly surpasses  3 . Bush ignored briefings, yes, as did Rumsfeld, Ashcroft and (most of all) National Security Advisor Condi Rice. And they didn't just ignore briefings. Look back a little, and you'll surely notice that I mentioned a few other things they ignored.  You asked me earlier, "You truly and honestly believe that 9/11 could have been prevented?" I responded in the affirmative. Then you said "Don't tell me there was some sort of way we could have prevented 9/11."  What do you want, Mike?!?  You ask me a yes or no question, I tell you "yes," and then you tell me not to tell you yes. What is your problem here? I'm not answering the way you want me to answer, obviously, but is there some other problem?  Remember the first post you addressed to me? Here's a little quote from it: "I make no attempt to be fair, objective, or open to your ideas. I believe you are fundamentally wrong on almsot every issue, given your previous posts. I seek to convert you, not to form some sort of consensus or compromise."  So what are we doing here then, huh? You're not converting me because I'm too well-read on the issues to vote for Bush or any other conservative. I'm not converting you because you outright said that you aren't open to what I have to say. This is becoming more and more clear, though there is a difference between 'not being open to my ideas' and 'shitting all over the facts that I present.'   The way you talk to me is the same way Bill O'Reilly talks to his non-conservative guests, only I'm able to complete my statement  before  you can rush in to obscure it.

      I said: "Why should our tax dollars be sent to fund "The Rush Limbaugh Show"? "  Mike said: They don't.  HERE'S THE TRUTH: From  urlLink indybay.org : "Limbaugh’s radio program is broadcast to American troops via the American Services Network, a taxpayer-funded radio and television broadcasting agency."  -------  Mike said: People actually Pay Money to carry [his] show since doing so in turn makes them money. This is how success is measured and rewarded in the USA.   I SAY: Not everyone believes that wealth equals success. Mother Teresa wasn't a wealthy woman, per se, but we are now considering her for sainthood. Was she not a success?  -------  Mike said: Tax dollars only fund failures.   I SAY: In the case of Rush Limbaugh, this is very true.  -------  Mike says: If PBS was so valuable to its audience they would be worth advertisers' dollars.   I SAY: Advertisers bring bias with them. That's what makes NPR great: There are no advertisers to please. Advertisers only care about ratings; about how many people will hear there ads. With advertisers, stations are pressured to pull in the biggest audience they can, which means providing programming that appeals to the lowest common denominator, which means shows like "Who Wants to Marry My Dad?". You won't find these mindless shows on PBS or NPR. And by the way, PBS and NPR are valuable to its audience. That's why, twice a year, individuals (like me) pledge their support to help fund them.  -------  Mike says: Why would it matter if anything is "fair and balanced"? Fox claims it because they ahve shows like Hannity and Colmes. Hannity is conservative and Colmes is liberal. Fox claims to be free of bias, but of course being human they can't be. But they are at least making a try at it. CNN and NPR probably think they aren't biased, but they surely are. And guess which way their dishonest bias shifts?  I SAY: If you want the truth about Fox News, buy  urlLink Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism . I'm not even going to discuss Fox News as if it were a genuine news source. It's not. Watch this documentary.   -------  Mike says: I don't care how biased any "news" source is as long as they are up-front about it.  I SAY: That's a shame. So you're just going to give in to growing media consolidation, resulting in more bias, and say "I don't care"? As a media reform activist, and American citizen, this attitude offends me more than you'll ever know.  -------  Mike says: The NYT and CNN are certianly not up-front with their liberal bias yet you probably think they are the most objective sources out there. Another fact you can't seem to acknowledge.  I SAY: I don't think you never mentioned NYT's and CNN's bias, so how was I supposed to know you needed me to acknowledge this "fact"? But now that you brought it up, I'm going to deny that their biased until you show me proof as to what makes these news sources bias. You love to demand proof out of me, even though you just ignore or disregard any proof that I present (remember our little chat on preventing 9/11?). So now I ask you: Prove to me that CNN and NYT are bias.  -------  I said that Limbaugh said: "Playground bullying is good for kids"  Mike said: He specifically said that bullies, as a recent study shows, are more assertive and popular. He didn't say it was good for kids, just that bullying has 2 sides. It was in his "light-hearted stack" so it was meant to be humorous. I laughed at it myself.  I SAY: If what you say he said is true (which you haven't proven, the way you demanded I prove that Bush said that they had found WMD), then it still is a mean thing to say. As a victim of bullying, I know that there is nothing humorous about it.   So, Rush said this was meant to be light-hearted? You yourself laughed at this? That's a kick in the teeth for all I'm concerned.  -------  I said that Limbaugh said: Environmentalists are "wacko"  Mike said: Whacko environmentalists are whacko. For instance, those that support Kyoto, that say global warming will kill us all, those that would rather save trees/animals than people. Those are whackos. Greenpeace is whacko. Most of these people are really just socialists and anti-capitalists. They wield the environmentalist club to beat down their enemies.  I SAY: So Limbaugh DID say this, huh? You're not denying he said it. Now you're just fanning a flag of hatred. I don't even know how to respond to these accusations you've spewed out with no regard to proof or facts. Do you have facts to support your claims here? You demand them out of me, I'll demand them out of you.  -------  I said that Limbaugh said: "Corporations that set up phony headquarters in the Caribbean to avoid paying income taxes are doing the right thing"  Mike said: A company's actions are never right or wrong. They merely "are."  I SAY: So you're not only admitting that Rush  did  say this, but you're also disagreeing with what he said? Good to hear.  -------  I said that Limbaugh said: "A war every 20 years or so would be a good thing so that young Americans of every generation would know what it's like to be victorious"  Mike said: What's wrong with this?   I SAY: Again, you are saying that these words did come from Rush, so I was not making it up. As for this question of "what's wrong with this," my reason is simple: war is meant to be the last resort. We try to resolve conflict through peaceful means before we go to war. Pearl Harbor was bombed, indicating that the Japanese were not about to listen to reason, so we went to war. Terrorists flew planes into the twin towers, so we went to war against these terrorists. Sadaam did not have anything to with 9/11, nor did he present any clear and imminent threat to America, so going to war in Iraq was uncalled for.  -------  I said: "Rush expounds on education, though he never went to college."  Mike said: He has experience and accomplishments to back up his advice.  I SAY: Such as...?  -------  I said: "He [Limbaugh] expounds on the war on drugs, though he has a drug problem and has purchased illegal drugs."  Mike said: His opinions on drugs have matured over the years. You can't say for sure if he has committed a crime until he is convicted. But I'm sure a little thing like due process won't stop you.  I SAY: You seem to like jumping to conclusions about how I feel about a lot of fundamental American ideas. No, I agree with due process. As for whether or not he's guilty of having a drug problem, lookey here:  urlLink Limbaugh admits addiction to pain medication . It mentions in the third paragraph that these painkillers were illegal to buy/own unless prescribed by a licensed physician. What do his medical records show?  urlLink Here's a peek . Looks like he  was  prescribed these painkillers for a while, but when his prescription ran out, he went "doctor shopping" ("trying to find a physician willing to prescribe drugs illegally," as defined by the investigators in the context of this case.)  -------  I said: "You don't like the idea of the wealthiest Americans paying taxes to support the poor? Rush Limbaugh has been on welfare."  Mike said: Is he on it now? We conservatives judge the success of a government program by how many people no longer need it.  I SAY: Then why do "you conservatives" want to cut the funding of welfare programs, or cut them all together? Is it because you don't think people should  ever  get the aid of this government program? If so, what do you have to say about Limbaugh using it?  -------  I said: "NPR is non-partisan; it deserves funding. Rush Limbaugh isn't; he doesn't deserve squat."  Mike said: To close us out, what in the world caused you to think that Rush Limbaugh got any government funding?   -------  I SAY:  urlLink This, for one.   -------  Mike said: The closest thing I can think of is that Armed Forces Radio does carry 1 hour of Rush every weekday.  I SAY: Exactly.  -------  Mike said: They pay him for this the same way they pay for all their programming. They also carry NPR.  I SAY: NPR is not partisan. Rush Limbaugh is extremely partisan. Carrying NPR doesn't cancel out the fact that they carry Rush Limbaugh (which, as you've said, is a for-profit, commercial program). A right-wing radio show can't be balanced off with politically neutral programs from NPR. Maybe if they also carried Air America programming, then that would be fair.

       urlLink Kerry's remarks at the UNITY 2004 Conference   Stereotypes lurk on both sides of the aisle. Conservatives must be wary of appearing callous and cruel, while Liberals have to be wary of being way too granola and weak on defense. I think any smart politician is aware of this.  So what's up with John?   I believe I can fight a more effective, more thoughtful, more strategic, more proactive,   more sensitive   war on terror that reaches out to other nations and brings them to our side and lives up to American values in history.    Regardless of what he meant, does he really want to tie the words 'sensitive' and 'war' together in one neat little bundle? Are the American people interested in being 'sensitive' as we try to protect our way of life?  Keep talking John. I thought Bush had the monopoly on entertaining speech.

       urlLink DRUDGE REPORT 2004?   Well, Kerry's fellow war vets are speaking out in a new book, and they aren't painting a good portrait of the Senator.   George Bates, an officer in Coastal Division 11, participated in numerous operations with Kerry. In UNFIT FOR COMMAND, Bates recalls a particular patrol with Kerry on the Song Bo De River. He is still "haunted" by the incident:   With Kerry in the lead, the boats approached a small hamlet with three or four grass huts. Pigs and chickens were milling around peacefully. As the boats drew closer, the villagers fled. There were no political symbols or flags in evidence in the tiny village. It was obvious to Bates that existing policies, decency, and good sense required the boats to simply move on.  Instead, Kerry beached his boat directly in the small settlement. Upon his command, the numerous small animals were slaughtered by heavy-caliber machine guns. Acting more like a pirate than a naval officer, Kerry disembarked and ran around with a Zippo lighter, burning up the entire hamlet.   Bates has never forgotten Kerry's actions.   You wanna know something?    I don't care.  I don't care about what happened in Viet Nam, good or bad.  I didn't really care about his Silver Star and Purple Heart(s), and I don't care about some questions surrounding said medals.  Viet Nam was a long time ago, and it really has little bearing on today's situation.  I'm much more interested in what Kerry has done in the Senate, and what he says he will do in Iraq and in the War on Terror.  That gives me plenty of ammunition to oppose him.  This book, and these questions about Viet Nam will have an impact, but I think the country would be better served to let this drop and focus on TODAY.

       urlLink An Overview of the U.S. Department of Education-- Pg 4   I'm starting a new thread on the Financial Aid issue found below.  I looked this up during lunch, and I thought it would be interesting.  First, check out  urlLink this  page titled "What the Department of Education does  NOT  do".   Under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Nothing specific is said about education in the Constitution; therefore it falls outside federal authority.  In creating the Department of Education, Congress made clear its intention that the secretary of education and other Department officials be prohibited from exercising "any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system." The establishment of schools and colleges, the development of curricula, the setting of requirements for enrollment and graduation -- these are responsibilities handled by the various states and communities, as well as by public and private organizations of all kinds, not by the U.S. Department of Education.    Well, that's a relief.  At least they acknowledged the Tenth Amendment.  However,  urlLink here  is what they think they are allowed to do.   1. The Department of Education — establishes policies relating to federal financial aid for education, administers distribution of those funds, and monitors their use.  2. The Department of Education— collects data and oversees research on America's schools and disseminates this information to educators and the general public.  3. The Department of Education— identifies the major issues and problems in education and focuses national attention on them.  4. The Department of Education— enforces federal statutes prohibiting discrimination in programs and activities receiving federal funds and ensures equal access to education for every individual.   How do these activities differ from the prohibitions acknowledged in the Tenth Amendment?  They hand out money, collect data and 'focus attention'.  All for  urlLink $63 billion  per year.  $63 billion for an organization that really has no right to exist.  Why can't we abolish it?  What vital service does it provide that can't be done by the states, where it belongs?

"'Europeans are surprised to hear that John Kerry is talking about America the same way as George W. Bush does,' the paper said. 'They are amazed that at the Democratic Convention in Boston, he saluted like a soldier, one hand up at his temple.  They would prefer not to hear it when Kerry promises that he would never hesitate to use force in case America is under threat. They are disappointed.'"    Get that?  Europe is disappointed that we would use force when America is under threat.  You really want any administration that spends more than two minutes worrying about European concerns expressed as they are here?

      The Village.  Diane and I went to see this last night, despite the reviews from Ebert and other places.  I decided that my desire and blind hope for a good film outweighed the risk of wasting my money on crap.  Unfortunately, Ebert was mostly right.  That isn't to say there are some moments of redemption in the movie, but if you added the good together it would make a solid trailer.  The rest of the film was mostly forgettable.  I found myself thinking about work, the Blog, housework, my own writing and so forth, even during some of the more dramatic moments in the film.  The pace was ponderous, the tension flat, and the characters mostly empty.  When the Big Reveal comes, I had a Matrix Reloaded moment in miniature.    That being said, there were some positives in the film, but not enough positives for me to recommend seeing it.  And it pains me to say that, because unlike Mike, I've mostly enjoyed Night's films.  I enjoyed William Hurt's character - a man who wanders around the film with a woodenness that is actually appropriate.  I liked the formality and stiffness of the dialogue, which certainly gave it an antique feel.  We witness one of the most visceral and disturbing stabbings I think I've seen, remarkable for the casualness with which it occurs.  And finally, Bryce Dallas Howard, the daughter of Ron Howard, makes what is essentially her debut in a major role, and she's going to be something to watch in the future.  Her performance was one of few things that made the film watchable, and I think she's going to be commanding relatively large salary in the future.  She has some real acting talent, well beyond the current crop of 'I'm just a pretty face' actresses making the rounds today.  It's really a shame that this film suffered from such a weak story when you get right down to it.  I've been thinking about it now for a few hours, and it isn't too difficult to come up with a great many improved twists and story arcs from the original material.  I don't know much about Night and how he works, but I'm thinking that he should dump the 'Written, Produced and Directed by' trend and bring in some help.  He dreamed up some real potential here, but it needed an outside hand to help shape it into something stronger.  There was something here at the core, but he didn't bring it to the screen.  Too bad.  Night doesn't have to be 'the trick ending guy'.  I do believe he has a valid claim to Hitchcock, and he should stay with this type of material.  But he should also recognize his limits and bring in some fresh perspectives to help restore the meat to his projects.  I'll still see his films without hesitation, at least for the near future, but if he strings off another Village, I'll have to put him on my rental list.

"When asked who would be a better president, the journalists from outside the Beltway picked Mr. Kerry 3 to 1, and the ones from Washington favored him 12 to 1. Those results jibe with previous surveys over the past two decades showing that journalists tend to be Democrats, especially the ones based in Washington.

"Regardless of the purpose, such behavior [socialism] is immoral. It's a reduced form of slavery. After all, what is the essence of slavery? It's the forceful use of one person to serve the purposes of another person. When Congress, through the tax code, takes the earnings of one person and turns around to give it to another person in the forms of prescription drugs, Social Security, food stamps, farm subsidies or airline bailouts, it is forcibly using one person to serve the purposes of another.   ...   Some might rejoin that all of this is a result of a democratic process and it's legal. Legality alone is no guide for a moral people. There are many things in this world that have been, or are, legal but clearly immoral. Slavery was legal. Did that make it moral? South Africa's apartheid, Nazi persecution of Jews, and Stalinist and Maoist purges were all legal, but did that make them moral? "    Indeed.

       urlLink CNN.com - Poll: No 'bounce' for Kerry so far - Aug 1, 2004   I'm going to try to step out of my partisan mold for just a moment and talk about this.  Kerry didn't seem to pick up any convention bounce whatsoever.  That's not a partisan statement.  It just is.  What does this mean?  The last time a major party convention failed to generate a bounce was 1972 McGovern convention, which resulted in a 520-17 loss for McGovern in the all important (and rightly so) Electoral College.  Now, I don't think for a moment that this election is going to be anything BUT close.  We aren't going to see a landslide either way.  But I do think this is really a significant problem for Kerry.  This was his big chance to introduce himself on his own terms, and it seems to have not had much of an impact.  I'm not making a judgment on his speech, just reacting to the polls.  Now, if Bush fails to get a bounce, then all it means is the electorate doesn't give a crap about the election this year.  Or alternate, you can try to argue that almost every single voter has already decided which way to vote, but the data doesn't support that interpretation.    It's going to be an interesting finish.

       urlLink National Sales Tax??   Oh please let this be true.  If Bush got behind this and got serious about it, I'd walk over broken glass for him.

      Hey, I have a request for everyone:   Go to the following page: http://selectsmart.com/PRESIDENT/ . Once you're there, answer the questions honestly. Really think about how you feel about the issues asked of you, and respond accordingly. Before you submit your answers for calculations, uncheck the three boxes at question 17, "Candidate Viability." Leaving them checked will limit what candidates can appear on your list. (Based on your answers, you'll receive a list of candidates in the order of how well they reflect your point of view, starting with the best/highest match. Then post your list here. Here's mine:  DANNY'S LIST OF IDEAL CANDIDATES, FROM MOST IDEAL TO LEAST 1. Your ideal theoretical candidate. (100%) 2. Cobb, David - Green Party (90%) 3. Nader, Ralph - Independent (85%) 4. Sharpton, Reverend Al - Democrat (82%) 5. Kucinich, Rep. Dennis, OH - Democrat (81%) 6. Brown, Walt - Socialist Party (78%) 7. Dean, Gov. Howard, VT - Democrat (78%) 8.
