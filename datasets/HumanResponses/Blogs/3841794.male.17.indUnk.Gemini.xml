      Well here I am, posting from Canada (more specifically in Victoria), using the AirPort on my dad's laptop.  I might be posting from the Seattle Airport, also using AirPort, but they were charging $7!   $7!  for it and our flight was boarding in 10 minutes anyway.  But now I'm in Canada.  Not much is really different.  Although you  can  buy Cuban cigars here.  I'll come up with some more stuff after I've watched some Canadian News TV (looks good though), slept in a Canadian bed, and breathed Canadian air for a whole day.

      Starting tomorrow I shall be forced to journy though a foreign land surrounded by trackless wastes.  I shall live amoung strange people with strange customs and strange forms of government (especially concerning healthcare...).  I shall be in a place that can only be described as the Land that God gave Cain!  That is right, (gasp) I shall be in Canada!  If I run out of stuff to do, I'll probably post some observations, probably dramatically exaggerated for comic effect.  Our hotel should,  should , have internet.

      As far as I know the RPG Exalted is the only RPG in which one can play a gunslinging courtier who, while imprisoned by his mother, an insane mage, and a renegade monk for the fact that he is a reincarnated god, composes an epic poem about tragedy and betrayal and writes it on the walls of his cell, in blood.  He composed music too, but he couldn't play it, his hands being bound by White Jade Shackles.  Yeah, and he wanders around with a shapeshifting, blood-drinking demon bodyguard, who protects him from the ninjas sent after them by the sinister lord of a massive trading cartel known only as the Guild.  He has also dabbled in bandit hunting, diplomancy, illeagal arms sales, and impersonating a god (that one worked great!).  And basic zombies will kick the (explitive) out of you because they JUST WON'T DIE!  And despite all that craziness, the setting holds together and presents an interesting world.  Three cheers for White Wolf.

      I was going to post something deeply insightful about arbitrary meanings, but it's late and I need to get up before noon tomorrow, so ponder it yourself.

      I have noticed, lately, an interesting shift in the content of my hotmail junk mail.  Instead of recieveing e-mails advertising porn sites, I am now recieveing e-mails telling me about hot buy stocks.  Could this mean that lust for money has finally overcome lust for sex in American culture?  But being someone who is "more interested in martial arts then sex" (from Outlaws, though I'm not quite a Song Jiang), I'm waiting to get junkmail from 5h1j1n@outlaws.com about HO*T CR3SC3NT H4LB3RD L*U B*U 4CT10N!!!! FR33!!!

      At an article remarking on the 200th aniversery of Burr killing Hamilton.  The article talked mostly about Hamilton and said basically nothing about Burr or the events leading to the duel.  It ignored the fact that Burr was only pushed into calling for a duel by the arrogent position Hamilton took in their corrispondence.  It also claims that Hamilton missed on purpose, something I have seen no evidence of elsewhere and something I very much doubt Hamilton would do.  In this view it also fails to consider the incredible innaccuracy of the weapons they were using in the duel.  It does a good job of describing the period, but forgets that Burr doing the killing is just as important as Hamilton being killed.

      I just watched the Japanese movied Onibaba, so here are my thoughts.  It is all set in an endless field of tall grass.  Two women, one old, one the first's daughter in law (we never get their names, or at least I didn't catch them), make a living by murdering samurai fleeing from the endless wars and selling their equipment to an old man, who then sells it back to the constantly fighting armies.  These two have a miserable existance, but it is a stable one.  They live in harmony with each other and the only other person they have contact with.  Then the husband's friend (Hachi) returns from the wars.  He reveals that after being drafted he and the husband (he had a name, I think it was mentioned once)  fought on one side, until they were captured, at which time they fought for the other.  Eventually they fled and tried to steel food from some farmers.  The farmers beat them and Hachi abandoned the husband to die.  Hachi's return disrupts the balance and "lust, jealousy, and rage threaten to drive a wedge between the mother and daughter-in-law.  It isn't long before the presence of an ominous demon mask seals the trio's fate." (from the DVD case)  Now, my thoughts:  Completely opposite to the spirit of such films as Yojimbo, Sanjuro, Seven Samurai, Zatoichi, etc.  which were actually made at about the same time which display the Samurai spirit even in situations completely lacking in it.  More in common with The Bad Sleep Well (good movie, btw, but the suptitles of the one at That's Rentertainment are horrible, Toshiro Mifune), but Mifune is again the Samurai in an unlikely place.  Also the supporter of traditional morality dies a pretty nasty death.  Rasies some question about what is right and what is wrong when you have to murder to live.  Effective, but I'm not sure I would really recomend it, see The Bad Sleep Well instead.  Unrated, but should be R for nudity.

      You may not know it, but John Kerry just wrote a book called "The New War."  In it he describes a strategy of fighting against international crime, eg. the Yakuza.  He makes no mention of terrorism.  One only seeing the Bush add would say it was because Kerry has no clue what he's doing.  One checking Amazon.com would say it's because he wrote the book in 1997.  I guess 7 years ago is still kindof new.  For lies, lies, lies, and more lies: www.gerogewbush.com

      A conspiracy?  Do the Democrats intend to create a Johnocracy in which people named John rule the world?  What about people who spell their names Jon?  Does Johan count?  Whan about Ian?  I'm still (illeagally) voting for Burr-Van Ness.

      go here: http://www.mydd.com/files/user/2/bushgas.gif, interesting, but if you look carefully, meaningless.  By the way, read Tom Tomorrow's blog, at www.thismodernworld.com, everyday.  Even though it's not actually Tom posting right now.  Colleges are getting more aggressive.  I was called by Cornell today.

      ... where there are lots of things to do, and yet you have no energy to do any.  Probably a good defence mecanism; if you don't have the energy to do anything you can't work yourself to death.  Think!  What if Zhuge Liang had felt like this some days.  He might not have died at Wu Zhang Yuan!  I was gonna say something about the arrogence of the left, or maybe talk about an anime, or maybe complain about the Bushies, or maybe even talk about philosophy, but I think I'll just sit here and listen to the Noir soundtrack.

      I recently saw a Bush add that compared Democrats and Nazis.  It had footage of Kerry and Gore speaking and then faded to an image of Hitler and then had German in the background as Kerry and Gore continued to speak.  This initially confused me.  How are the Democrats, a liberal party with peace on its platform, like the Nazis, the hardest line right wing militerists you can find?  Then it all became clear.  Both the Democrats and the Nazis support economic recovery!  Both of them plan to do it by providing jobs to the lower classes!  Clearly the good intentions of wanting to help the Americian people had led the Democrats to the Hell of Nazidom.  Clearly, of course, the Bushies are nothing like the Nazis, they support further economic decline, and giving money to the rich.  And they don't have any good intentions so there's no chance they will be likewise corrupted.   I think I have made myself clear.

      Lots of wonderful ideas come into this world, bubbling with promise, offering to end all problems.  Communism will create true social equality for all!  Democracy will insure the protection of our liberty!  Nuclear power will provide clean, endless electricity!  Dynamite will proove so devestating as to end all wars!  [Obscure Reference Alert! (henceforth, ORA) ]  Creating the Imaginary Numbers will allow the Da Han Zhong and Sir Basil to rule the world!  Createing a blog will allow me to release all the pent up emotions that society forbids me to display!  Things don't often turn out that way.  Eventually you end up with Stalin, Bush, nuclear waste, more devestating wars, an army of genetically engineered, white haired clones with the latest military hardware and training, or, well, um, actually the last one's working out pretty well, but still...  Anyway, it would thus seem that a less than completely optimistic perspecive would be best suited to dealing with the real world.    I recently saw a Bush add that, as well as comparing to Democracts to the Nazis, but that is an outrage for another post, proclaimed that the Bushies have optimism.  The only thing this add says about the Bushies is that they have optimism.    One could argue that it is optimism that caused 9-11 (I won't, I personally believe it was stupidity).  Does this remind anyone else of Andrew Jackson "who can fight" vs. John Quincy Adams "who can write?"  This time, lets actually look at what their chants are actually saying and decide that we really would prefer a literate president over a muscular one.  With the exception of Aaron Burr.  Burr-Van Ness for President 2004!

      Some of you may notice that the photo in my profile is not original work!  It is, in fact, art from a card from the collectable card game Legend of the 5 Rings, published by AEG (website www.l5r.com).  Many other things, including the name of this blog are also references to this game.  I inted to escape from my violation of copyright law by unrestrained flattery and blatent promotions.  Legend of the 5 Rings is my favorite CCG, and if anyone asked me I would say that it is the best currently in print.  Anyone who plays Magic: the Gathering should sell (or burn) all their cards and take up L5R right away!  Now to address this particular artist:  I am really impressed with your work.  I think it captures the spirit of the Scorpion Clan perfectly.  I would be honored if you would allow me to use your art in my profile.  Thank you!    By the way, I am not responsible for damages caused as a result of burning M:tG cards following my above suggestion.  That is your own [explitive] fault.  Sue WotC.

      "... and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes!  Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not.  Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary:  so let them go."  Thus spoke Zarathustra!  It's really quite interesting.  I am of Jewish descent so I picked up Nietzsche, knowing that the Nazis had used him, fully expecting to end up disagreeing with him and hating him.  But, I immedietly discovered that not only is he completely anti-facist, but he also puts into words, much more poetic than my own (or at least in this translation), many of my feelings about religion and reality.  "Once the sin against God was the greatest sin;  but God died, and those sinners died with him.  To sin against the earth is no the most dreadful thing, and to esteem the entrails of the unknowable higher than the meaning of the earth."  Thus spoke Zarathustra!   There are some times, however, that Nietzsche wrote too well for his own good.  These are the quotes that taken out of context allow the Nazis to use the work of someone who declared that in his perfect world, "I am just having all anti-Semites shot."  One of the Nazis most popular quotes was "You shall love peace as a means to new wars - and the short peace more than the long."  It may seem that Nietzsche is advocating militalism, and he is, just not the literal kind.  What he is really proposing here is something akin to Plato's Dialectic, the idea that truth can only be found through constant mental debate.  Nietzsche is just using the metaphor of war to describe such internal debate.   Of course, Nietzsche did kind of go crazy later is his life...

      Hello all.     I finally gave in and created a blog so I can say all the things about you that I'm too timid to say to your faces.     Don't worry, I won't use any real names...               ...maybe...                                   ... if you bribe me...                                                                     ... a lot...    Anyway, I'll try to post some interesting things now and then, if you keep reading it.

      ... my heart's on fire, This base deception burning to repay, This very night, My vengance dire, Shall glut itself in gore, Away, away!                    - Pirates of Penzance  Well just the first part, but as I have previously warned, I am scheduled to vanish for this next week and return tired, but signifigently richer (assuming I return at all, which is always in doubt, on the other hand I have been burning insence to Guan Yu for luck and it has been working so far, I won my last 3 games of L5R, even going so far to pump the mighty Hida Kuon full of arrows with Tsuruchi Takasu, Tsuruchi Hunters, and a bit of Tsuruchi 'magic' [new flavor text for the Hunters  "This is not the one we're looking for.  This is the best warrior in the Empire and the champion of the mighty Crab Clan, who, every day, risk their lives to keep us safe from the unspeakable horrors of the Shadowlands.  Kill him anyway." ], all delivered from the deck of  The Deathless  [there were also elite spearmen in the unit and I needed to be naval to avoid Tani Hitokage's thrice damned duel of force].  Bow control is not using more than five arrows at once, but I ramble.).  I should have web access at my undisclosed (for reasons of State Security) location (which may or may not be the same location as Kachiko), so I should continue to post, assuming anything interesting happens.   On Summer Reading.  Portriat had some interesting parts, but otherwise seemed to drag.  It was interesting to get a look into the inside of the Catholic Church.  Not much of an ending.  The style, and the development thereof was indeed interesting, but not all that easy to read.  Invisible Man has some good parts, but seems to drag a bit in others.  I dislike the fact that no white people appear as positive characters (or remain as them for long), as, well, I should hope that it is possible for me to be viewed as, at least, a decent person, if not much more, by African-Americans, something the book does not provide much hope for.  Of course, I haven't finished it so, well, we'll see.  On music.  Any movie I make will have "Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi" from Carmina Burana as a theme, probably for climactic fight/battle scenes.  On rain.  Wounderful dramatic and emotional effect.  Will use in any movie I make.  On the time.  It is late.  On jingasas.  Good hats.  Look cool.  On the eating of human hearts.  Always remember to splash the victim's chest with cold water before extracting the heart.  It makes it crispy and improves the flavor.  But, also, always make sure that the victim is not someone of great renown in the Fraternity of Galant Men first, like, say, Song Jiang.  But alas now I must go, I've got places to go, people to meet, and much anime to watch before I sleep.

      I know I said that I'd post last night, but I got in at 2 after 15 hours of transit and I decided that my sleep was more important than posting my observations (selfish, arn't I).  Well, I'm back from Canada, back in a country where you make sure cars are going to stop before stepping onto crosswalks (in Canada even SUVs would stop), back in a country where you go through customs and then security and only make it to your flight because it was delayed, back in a country that elected Bush.  Not much has changed, except now there's a statue of a diefied Chinese hero on my desk next to the Greek revolutionary, and my internet was down for a few hours this morning  If you want to know details about my trip, ask me at the party Nate   IS   going to hold before I flee the state again on Sunday.  Random side note, all the other people on the kayaking trip hated Bush.  I'd say this is a really good sign, but then they were all from strongly Democratic states, Canada, the UK, or the Netherlands (which by the way, has a legal minimum of 6 weeks vacation time for, as I understand, ALL jobs), so its not really news.

      This is just me saying that I'm still here, I haven't been swallowed by the fearsome nation of Canada.  My lack of activity the last few days has been because I was out kayaking on Johnstone Strait for the last several days (great fun, by the way) and they don't have wireless several hundred kilometers from civilization.  Right now I'm posting in a hotel in Campell River, BC (British Colombia for you ignorant Americans), and the wireless here is  very  weak.  I spent my first 30 min. online trying to check the new L5R Wrath of the Emperor previews (which, of course, tells you that that card game means more to me than you do), then an hour trying to get headlines from the New York Times website (which of course tells you that world events mean more to me than you do, but not more to me than L5R, especially with Do Not Dely the Inevitable), several minutes checking a web combic (you can fill in the sarcastic comment yourselves), and now I just got around to posting here (and telling you where you rank in my priorities).  It is late and I have to get going early tomorrow.  I probably post something more complete about my trip when I get home, if I get home.  See you then.

      Tonight I was treated to dinner that was provided by the meeting my dad is attending.  This was a most interesting experience.  The dinner was at Royal Roads College, which's main feature is a castle.  We sat between two Brits, across from two Frenchmen, and at the same table as two Germans (I think), and someone from elsewhere in Europe.   A German and a Russian stood outside smoking.  After dinner music was provided by a bad rock band composed of middle aged Canadians.  Not only the grey-haired, respected, Japanese atmospheric scientist sitting at the next table, but also his two female grad students (who happened to be dressed in kimonos) danced.  A word on scientist conversations, as I have observed many over the last few days and they all seem to follow a set pattern.  First the two scientists will introduce themselves.  Then they will work out their connection to each other ("So you were Jim's student before I arrived?").  Then one will ask some very specific question about the others work, completely abandoning anyone else trying to follow the conversation as they lunge into a morass of technical terms.

      Yes, today (or yesterday for you now) is British Columbia Day, enjoy it.  Anyway, an amusing anecdote.  To get dinner tonight I had to mix with atmospheric scientists (and they are a frightening lot) to slip into the Empress Hotel and partake of the buffet.  There was, however, a shortage of chairs and tables.  Thus, one could see extremely respected professors from all around the world sitting on the floor.  It was quite a sight.  It seems odd that they would invite all these people and neglect the matter of seating.
