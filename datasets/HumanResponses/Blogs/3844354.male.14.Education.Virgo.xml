      Great day today! Sunny. Did swim in the pool, had a barbecue and played on the computer. An average day. Don't want to go to bed yet, not tired. Hope my dad doesn't get mad because I'm not in bed yet.

      My dad is inflating the upper ring now. My mum took the electrical pump, so we have to inflate it manually. I think setting up the pool will take longer than 10 minutes.

Anyway, it is al little better now, but still not good enough, and we're trying to set the pool up. The package says it should be ready in 10 minutes. Let's see...
