        hey!--what's up--well David finally called me yesterday while I was at work--I still really care for him but Sheryl said not to worry about him--this other guy named Justin(not Tabb) that I've been really good friends with for the past 4 years & I are going to do something tomorrow night so I guess ill see how that goes!--he is a great guy & is so sweet!--he is the Justin that bought my bunny for me!=)--anyways--Sheryl, Justin Tabb, & I have all decided to turn our lives around!--I'm so excited too!--my life was just going more & more to hell everyday but now I feel better about myself!--I haven't drank in two weeks!--some of my friends said I wont be able to keep it up but that just makes me want to keep it up even more!--I'm so ready to go to panama!--I wish both Justin's could go with us but =*( they cant!--next year hopefully we will all go on a trip after I get out of summer school since it'll be my *SENIOR* year!=)--but anyways I guess id better get back to work before I get into trouble!--love you--oh & Bubba if you read this I LOVE & MISS you very much!!--
