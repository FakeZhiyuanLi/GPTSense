      Well here's my big post covering the last three days of my boring life; here we go...  Bored Day #4 Friday, May 21, 2004    Friday was awesome because of the edge! They had a new obstacle course, which was cool, no trampoline this time though, that's fine, I'll just jump on mine... I bought this really cool hat in the beginning but let my friend borrow it for the first couple hours of the edge,(the edge runs from 6pm-11pm), but then I got back and was wearing it when a group of 15 people came over and accused me of stealing their fiends hat, which was really bougus. But then my friends: Justin, Anthony, Becca, Selina, Michael, Megan, Erica, Ariel, Rita, and John, came and backed me up. Then went to one of the edge staff members, who unfortunately was a friend of Selina's, and had acctualy seen me buy the hat, so that was that... well not exactly they went to 3 more edge staff members, before the put out a bullitan on the walie-talkies about people wanting a hat from me, and if they did, they would have to go home! After that I saw someone running the BIG JUMP Slide that I knew from when she visited my health class, and it was really cool, she let us get cuts for about 2 hours as long as no one in line said anything! it was so awesome! Well anyways, that's Friday...  Bored Day #5 Saturday, May 22, 2004    Saturday was pretty boring, we dug a small ditch aroung the house, powerwashed the house and cleaned off the porch, after that we watched Miricle.  Bored Day #6 Sunday, May 23, 2004    Today was a little bit better than yesterday, we sprayed the new siding for the house with primer, we just got a new paint sprayer. Now we just have to prime the rest of the house, then paint, then were done, anyways...                                             GOOD NIGHT

      Well today actually wasn't that boring! In computers I learned tons more stuff to make my webpage, it was sweet! After school I went over to Logan's house, then Anthony and Josh came over; we went down to the creek and went wsimming for about an hour. Then Anthony and Josh had to go eat, then they came back and we had a pinecone fight, except we didn't use pinecones; we used sheetrock. Me, Anthony, and Logan were up in the treehouse, and Josh was on the ground, later he started throwing rocks at us, then he hit Anthony in the back of the head with one and Anthony just went off on his "BEEP". Punches were flying, then the fight turned ugly, so I threw a handful of rocks at Josh, then he left, just as Anthony got a baseball bat. Tommorow is the Edge! It is so awesome. Well, anyway, I should probably get going, Night.  13 1/2 Days of School Left!!!

      Today was yet another boring day at school and afterschool; me and Dylan went over to Becca's house for an hour and she threw our bikes into her pond, she is really RUDE. She broke my front and back brakes, but luckily when me and Anthony came over she fixed them, which was cool! We ran the mile today, which I found is really about 2 miles, my time, a sad 18:30, each mile-9:15(times 2). We are writing a really boring essay for Social Studies/English where you have to compare two historical figures, and write a paragraph for each area of comparison. We started "The Quadratic Formula", in Algebra, which really sucks. In case any of you are wondering, I'm in the 8th Grade. Night.  Only 14 1/2 days left!!!

      Well, I'm Mickey and I will be supplying tones of storys from my boring day. Well, today was "fun", my neighbour brought over some kittens that we had to find the mom of, which we did, then my friends came over and we dug up dirt to fill up holes in the front yard. Around 6 we went over to Becca's hous which was really boring, except when becca broke some plastic chairs with one swing, that was cool, also when she chased Josh off her property. The edge is this friday which is really cool. It's this huge party at the Parkway Christian Center, they have tons of inflateable jump things and go-karts, and trampolines, and music, and food, totally awesome! Well, I gotta go to bed, night.
