      I left work at midnight and came back at 10am, just to find  urlLink this sick site  for you. What the fuck is their malfunction?? How idiotic and retarded can these guys be??!!  On more serious issues,  urlLink Make Trade Fair  is an interesting website I plan on reading through. A reminder to open one's eyes every once in a while.  And if you still beleive what the media feeds us, you should browse through  urlLink this site .  And stop beleiving  urlLink everything you heard in school .  For the couple of idiots I know (and the millions I don't - and don't want to) who don't know how to speak correctly, please  urlLink memorize this shit  (My father's wife, my mother's aunt). And for god's sakes drop the condescending tone of voice!!! You are nobody to be condescending with me. Better yet, shut the FUCK UP!!!! with people like you,  urlLink even this starts to make sense .    For the ultimate gaming experience, dump your Xbox and PS2, and check out the new urlLink  iTari .  Some  urlLink seriously good design here .  This is a great idea to help you deal with  urlLink telemarketers  and  urlLink ugly chicks .  In case you have some extra cash... pass me some!! ....then  urlLink buy one of these .  The DEA tells us how to start a new carreer  urlLink growing opium poppies and processing it into heroin !! Make sure you tell your kids!!  This is  urlLink just too gay .  Why wait for  urlLink Gmail , when you can get your 1Gb e-mail account at  urlLink Walla.com !   Farenheit 9/11  urlLink defense  , and the film's  urlLink unanswered questions . I'm still waiting to see it.   urlLink A nice gallery of funny pictures .   urlLink Somebody's got a point here .   urlLink They all are fucking morons !   Thats all I could gather today. Ill be back soon.

      ... to actually start this blog. It's been a while since I'd told some of you I'd be posting those vacation and party pictures...  Sorry I'm late. I still haven't downloaded all of the pictures, so I guess we'll have to wait some more.  But in the meantime, hope I can make you spend some time in some of my favourite pages.  Some may be  urlLink funny , others may be  urlLink stupid  or  urlLink interesting , others  urlLink serious . Just browse around and see if you are interested. I'll appreciate any comments. Thank You.  If you're feeling  urlLink nosstalgic for your long-lost childhood tv shows ...  urlLink buy a piece of them ! Gotta love these  urlLink crazy commercials . Play  urlLink Lemmings  online.
