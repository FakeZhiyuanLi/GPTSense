         I love to read novels. I like strong characters, that get under my skin. When I am reading a good book I can hardly put it down. I look forward to reading it, I get addicted to the book. I get upset if I am disturbed, I put myself inside the book. When I am reading, it is my personal time to get lost in the story. My favorite books usually deal with females, struggling for happiness, independence, fairness, romance.      One of the books I would be interested in reading would be The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd. I do not know much about this book, except that the cover has caught my attention at Barnes and Noble several times. It was on the  best seller list for a while. The story has to do with a young girl growing up in the south being raised by her father. Her mother died and she struggles with this. I think this will be an emotional story.       Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier is another novel I would like to read. I have seen the movie several times and enjoyed it. I know by past experiences the movie rarely does the book justice. This is story of a handsome widower who marries a young lady. They return to his big English manor in the country. There the new wife lives in the shadow of his first wife who was quite beautiful. The new wife is awkward and unsure of herself. In the end I think she proves to be a strong character.      Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is a novel I have been wanting to read for over a year now . I saw the author on one of those morning shows. She was discussing her book and how she had been raped like the character in the book. I know this book deals with a young girl who is brutally attacked and killed. She somehow is able to watch her family as they continue with their day  to day lives. I think this book deals with a lot of raw emotions.       These are my three choices not in any particular order of interest. I think the three books listed will have strong characters and make for interesting reading.

      I was born and raised in California. I assumed I would work, live, retire, and die in Southern California. This was all I knew. I had traveled some, but I tend to be very settled in nature. I like to know what I am doing the next hour, day, week, month and definitely the next few years. My husband was a military child and moved around and he is more adventurous than I am. After the adoption of my daughter, I began to feel a need to be with this little person all the time. My maternal instincts, which I thought didn't exist were turned on like a faucet. My job took a back seat to this little creature. I began to discuss being a stay at home mom with my husband. As much as he wanted this for me and our family, it was very difficult due to the high cost of living in California. Not being deeply religious I began to pray about this. My husband met this man through his job and had been in contact with him for a year about a potential job. One afternoon I happened to be home when this man called. I knew as I spoke with him he was calling to offer my husband a job. The new job would mean a big move, a move to North Carolina. I would give up a job with the State of California, where I had moved up career ladder, leave my family, friends and all I had ever known. Something in my gut told me to do it, I had to take this chance. I have been in North Carolina for over 2 years and I have no regrets. I have learned you can't plan everything, you never know where life is taking you.
