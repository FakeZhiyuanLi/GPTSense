      Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up. -Pablo Picasso   when one considers themself an artist, what does it really mean? i caight myself when i started saying that i was an artist to everyone. what does this entail? do i, as an artist, get special privileges of thought or inspiration? What defines me as an artist and not a regular worker? these are my thoughts as of late.   here is my answer, with a little help from my friends.... Georgia O'Keefe one said that "Everyone has mahny associations with a flower. You put out yor hand to touch it, or lean forward to smell it, or maybe touch it with your lips almost without thinking, or give it to someone to please them. But one rarely takes the time to reall see a flower. I have painted what each flower is to me and i have painted it big enough so that others will see what i see."  If one takes the interpretation of the flower to mean a person's views, thoughts, and emotions, this defines what an a artist does. They use those visual, auditory, sensual, olfactory, and all other senses to help others see what they see. When i was a young child, (7,8,9) i would always question what i saw. Am i seeing what everybody else sees, or am i interpreting it differently. If i looked at the color of a flower, i would think about whether everybody else saw that same color. I believed, in some way, that i saw everything different from everybody else. This, it seems, fueled my desire to be an artist. I wanted to relate my own thoughts, emotions, visions, and perceptions to others through my art. Art, as cliche as it sounds, is the window into my thoughts, emotions, and on the deepest level, my soul. I want to stay a child, as picasso said, we are all artists when were children. We all thought differently, without any preconceived notions or fore thought. We had no control over it, and that was the beauty.

      It seems that everything in this damned world of ours is set up in a way to scare the living hell out of everybody populating that world. If the world isnt ending in one million different ways, the terrorists are planning to do it in yet another. Then there are the natural disasters, the emotional ones, the ridiculously obscene ones. Everything these days is no longer built to spill, but built to scare. I hate the fact that i am effected by these things. I read something in the paper today, and it jarred me. I literally stopped, and just thought about what that could mean.   Rick said to me immediately after that day in September, that if its going to happen, it will probably happen whether we want it to or not. Because of this factor, we cant spend every day of our forsaken lives worrying about whether we are going to get nailed by  a taxi or fumed by some gas. We have to love the ones we love, and live the life we live. We cant spend our entire lives hiding in a hole to afraid of what  could  happen. This is not my attempt to be a pseudo intellectual, or to be something im not, its just my thoughts for the night. I got scared today, and i shouldnt have been.

      things go so fast these days. Im not talking about high school, and about how its almost over, or how much im going to miss SO MANY people...because i dont really feel that. Im talking about how fast  everything  goes. Today everybody was speeding on the highway...the day blew by...i ended up home without realizing i was home...everyhthing seems to be moving so much faster. Maybe the world is spinning faster. Maybe im just losing control over what i normally call "control".  Throughout these past few days, i would have a train of thought and realize that i really wanted to write it down in this thing. BUt now, as i have found time to do it, nothing comes to me. Its like a pen sitting in front of you waiting to be used, but every time you need to use its run out of ink. I dont know why i made a metaphor for somethign that was clear to begin with.   Today i played 4-square. Today i talked about my art to people who didnt care. Today i did a lot of things which nobody will know about, or more importantly care about. Today was a day like many other days, except for the fact, that it was most certainly today. today i thought about people. Some that i care about, and some that i dont.   This post seems like one of those overly melodramatic things which i scoff it from time to time. It's different because i wrote it though. Thats all thats necessary.  I am currently listening to: Yo La Tengo- Summer Sun

      It seems, as a departing gift for me, my brother bought me a ticket to Day 2 of Lollapalooza on Randall's island. First Off, the PIXIES ARE PLAYING...second off, THE FUCKIGN FLAMING LIPS ARE PLAYING... im really excited two of my favorite bands in same fucking concert will be amazing. I leave for college the 19th I think, so its going to be my last real time with my brother for a long time.   Thats all for today... my shoes are really comfortable no school tommorow because of Metropolitan Museum of Art trip with school.... i say things are pretty fantastic at the moment rock on

      Today was a thoroughly enjoyable day for many reasons. To begin with, today was the Senior Lunch Cruise. Meaning, that i didnt have to get to school until 9, and furthermore that i had no classes which meant no homework which meant further brightening of my day. the cruise itself was an enjoyable experience in its own right. i got to sit on the bow of a very nice boat, and comment on anything i liked with Dr. Zoubeck. I took lots of photographs (only because i could)... However, my day got SO much brighter when i got home and my new shoes had arrived. Now, i am not one to obsess over an article of clothing. But these shoes are very shway. they are puma anjans in blue nights/chinese red...pic will be posted for all to enjoy. So essentially, my day rocks. Now all i have to do is write an essay that was due on monday. Sweet!

      Of all the days to be sick i had to choose this one. Today, as i have just recently found out, was FUN DAY at school. Now Fun Day was devised as a way to lighten the mood at my school as final exams approach...Being a senior, with no final exams, it means a day like everything else with good food, dodgeball, and other rockadelic stuff. But, being the idiot i am, i became sick this monday. And this is the first monday i have   really   been sick. oh well... i slept till 11 30 so it was fun either way. My mom came home from Hong Kong today which was awesome. And she got my cumberbun (such a fun word) and my bow-tie while she was there. They are very much shway (a word i very rarely use). So that was my day i shall post something later of greater intelligence and meaning later...but right now im kind of out of it.

      Just to let you know...i should be writing a paper about the conditions which forced people in Germany during the holocaust to either commit crimes or survive them. But this weekend has been incredibly strange and very much enjoyable.   It began on Friday when i went to the Yankees v Mariners game in the Bronx. Our seats were two rows back from teh Mariners dugout. Seated all around us were the funniest hecklers in teh entire world. They began by making fun of the Mariners in general. Slowly, they moved to taunting and tormenting the bat boy. At one point, the bat boy, a kid no more than 15, turns around and screams FUCK YOU at all of us. At that point, we all applaud the batboy for his ballsy, and seemingly hilarious outburst. For the rest of teh game, whenver he would come out we would all scream BATBOY!!!!!!, and we pleaded the manager to let him pitch the rest of the game. the game itself was one of the weirdest i have attended. In the first inning, the Mariners walked 6 men leading the yankees to score 3 runs. Mussina, also, gave up 11 hits, but still managed to hold on to the lead of 9-5. in the 8th inning Suzuki Ichiro hit a foul ball down the third base line, and it was thrown to me by the Bat boy...amazing...its my first foul ball, and Ichiro is my favorite baseball player because of his Samurai like stance and his incredible agility. Overall the game was a blast...it was so much fun, and i couldnt stop laughing the whole time from the hecklers.   So Saturday i wake up at 11 and immediately (because it was hot and sweaty outside) had to go do yardwork. Now yardwork is not something which i am morally opposed to, and im not normally a lazy person, but sometimes i just dont get the point. The grass is going to grow, some people like it at different heights. Rick, likes it to be short, even though he never even spends anytime outside unless he is doing the yardwork to keep it short. So yardwork is a paradox of sorts in my mind. In the end, i always end up doing it because otherwise rick would destroy me. I then proceeded to do random house work and errands till 5, when....  I was to be  chilling with my room-mate from Yale last summer Brian. i hadnt seen him in ages, and it was really awesome. He is going to Harvard ( so i got to make fun of him for it), and we played pool, ate at a ridiculously good Sushi restaraunt Wild Ginger, and eventually hung out with some of his other friends. It was a splendid time, and i realized that i lived just 15 minutes away, so i plan on invading his household much more these days.   The finale to this crazy weekend occurred at Alec's afterprom. Now, i didnt even go to John Jay's Prom so immediately i felt out of place when i showed up. There was no drinking so it was all sober fun. I felt awkward again because i only knew 20%of the people there. But as it dragged on, and we watched the atrocious An American Werewolf in Paris with the stunning Julie Delphi (who?), it became more fun. At about 12 30/1 lots of people left. At this point the lateness got to my head and i began doing the most random things. Animal Planet was left on for a record 4 hours as we watched COlin Mochrie (the guy from Whose Line is it Anyway?) tell us all about animal attakcs. We were up till 5 with Elmers 3d Glue Paints detailing Mountain Dew can's as well as Ian's arms and legs. All together it was completely random.  Sunday= nothing happened  Overall, this weekend has truly rocked. I doubt anyone really cares about my strange and random weekend. But then again, i have the right to write about anything i wish, and you have the right to stop reading what i write. So i say take a stand and make a choice

Flowers are one of my favorite photographic subjects, but i, unlike most photographers, liek to take pictures showing the less romantic side. This one i particularly like because of the contrast, and the different shades of grey and the touch of yellow in the middle. You will probably see many many more of photos like this one in the months to come. Probably better ones to! &nbsp; urlLink

      If you ever have found yourself driving down the same road for the millionth time you may have noticed that you never are driving the same road. Something is always different about it, and this is what differentiates the past from the future. Perhaps it is the change from WInter to Spring occurring so quickly but recently i have noticed the changes in a million different ways. The sun sets later, and the trees get greener. For some reason these changes on this day struck me more than on others. I mean for christ sake the trees have gone from Bare to fully clothed in less than a week. They are going photosynthesis happy, and the pollen is laid across everything. What, in God's name, do these changes signify? Every year we experience the same change from Winter to Spring to Summer to Fall to winter and to Spring ( a seemingly beautiful movie). But every year is not the same. Trees bloom on different days and with different intensity. I never noticed how major these changes were. I cant remember teh alst time the trees looked so heavy with flowers and so green with life. The better question is why did i write about this? and why would you care about reading it?  Currently Listening to: Jack Johnson Live at the Orpheum

      Today,as i went to Greenwich Library to pick up some new tunes the skies were clearly about to open up. Everything becomes faded and begins to look like one of those old photographs. The light becomes that dull yellow, but everything seems wonderful. The wind begins to blow, and the sky darkens. I love this period right before the sky opens. I cant explain why but i just like to stand there watching the flashes of lightning miles away, and then let the rumble of the distant thunder roll over me like a crashing wave. Well, anyways, as i was standing there immensely enjoying this wonderful experience, a girl,  of  about my age, stood there doing the same thing. We both kind of stared at each other as the first droplets splashed on the ground. I dont know why, but it just seemed sort of kooky but awesome.   I picked up someseriously tasty tunes....

      Isaac Newton defined what we know as gravity. I sit here in this physics class of mine thinking about whether or not it would be possible for me to discover something new within this world which is quickly becoming claustrophobic with lack of ned possibilities. It is forcing me to no longer think out of the box, but re-create how we define the box. My level of thought is, on a scale of pools, lounging in the baby pool. Artistically I think of things in ways which even i surprise myself with. I need to progress my logisitic and scientific thought to the next level. I can do most of the tasks which are typically associated with a hard science, but i cant reach that next level of astounding thought. i feel that like i can read, but  at the same time unable to write.   As I move on to the next level of academia, the question of "higher-level" thinking becomes apparent again. Will i be able to succeed in the races with all my other incredibly successful peers? or will i be smothered under their greatness? hopefully, i wil be able to develop some sort of snorkel which enables me to breathe under all those other successful people.

      a generation gap appeared again today between my stepfather, Rick, and I today.  it was his belief that cleaning my room was of the utmost importance, not because of the necessity of cleanliness and organization, but because it   should   be done. I cleaned up most of the room, except for a little stack of papers in the corner, i had a train to catch, and i told him i would do it in the morning. He exploded screaming at me that if it   could   be done, it should be done. i could have easily cleaned up the mess the next morning, without any delay or inconvenience to anybody. he is from a generation that demanded something different. it wasnt teh fact that you could clean something later, its just that it could be done now, so why not get it done now instead of waiting until later. i ended up catching the train, and i did clean up the pile of papers...  the train took me to Grand Central, and my feet carried me to Penn Station, and from then on it just got weird. i met Scott Satkin, a long time friend from The Rock, and we were going to a Neil Young tribute concert in Prospect park. to sum up the day there are a few key quotes:  upon meeting one of scott's friends, he didnt even say hi he just said "i need a yo-yo", and thus we went to find him a yo-yo.  so we began to walk to the subway station, and we ask a cop for directions to Prospect park in Brooklyn, O:Excuse me officer, whats the best way to get to Prospect Park? Officer:Prospect Park? Why do you want to go there? O: We are going to a concert there? Officer: You guys are crazy. Do you know what your getting yourselves into?  Scott: YUP! Wait...maybe I dont.  Officer: All you white boys down there...you dont know what your getting yourselves into. Your crazy to go down there.  Prospect Park was one of the nicest, seemingly safest places i have ever been to in NYC.   On the F train to prospect park, a debate arose over the movie A Day After Tommorow, it pinnacled when scott said "DOES ANYONE ON THIS TRAIN NO THE FREEZING POINTS FOR DIATOMIC GASES?"  It was even funnier, when a random guy on the train with a PHD in Chem told us......  At the concert we were sitting there listening to Iron and Wine and scott turns around and says to the guy behind him "Could you please stop tapping the back or my chair, or at least do it to the beat of the music?" Guy: "My foot hasnt left the ground in 10 minutes" said in a gruff voice Scott: turns around quickly and shuts up.....  After some strange performances, and some really amazing ones, Scotts friends decided to bounce, and so Scott and I left with them to find one of their backpacks in the "Manhattan Lost and Found"....we eventually found the back pack and hit up a Bubble Tea Cafe, and we all had delicious japanese beverages with a waiter who knew nothing about agar (to the dismay of scott who looked up the exact definition up on his phone)..it turns out its a marine plant whihc is used for medicinal and cuisinary purposes... after bubble tea scott and his friends dropped me off at the Subway at 11 15 whereupon the train i took did not stop at grand central so i got off at Times Square. got to times square at about 11 30 and went to teh S shuttle, which turns out is not in service (which nobody informed all us standing there)...so that was 15 minutes wasted...so have to take 7 train ot Grand Central, but that doesnt leave for an additional 20 minutes as it needs to collect passengers....so its about 12 40 when i finally get to Grand Central, and this is when teh express leaves...i missed it by 2 minutes and had to wait an hour in grand central with these drunk guys who kept hitting on 14 year olds. weird. it was alright in the end, even when i got home to find my bed was stripped of sheets, and thus i am now about to sleep on the couch...its 3 30...i got home 30 mintues ago....  best bands at Neil Young Tribute: Iron and Wine (David Beam has the most amazing voice) Cat Power  Eric Mingus Sun kil Moon Bonfire Madigan

      Gushter, Rufus Rainright, and Ben Floods... this torrential wednesday was filled with good music, good friends and good times... it poured rain so hard that you couldnt help but laugh...if it had rained any lighter it would have been an annoyance, any harder it would have been a disaster... in reality, teh rain was awesome... everybody who went to that concert will remember because of the rain. becaue of Ben Folds rendition of "Rain Drops Keep Fallin", and Rufus's "Somewhere Over the Rainbow"...Guster, well, they were guster.  every band who played was really amazing. Each had their own flair, and each played in a style which made the music that much better. Ben Folds was on fire, and he just looked like he was having too much fun... Rufus sang his heart out to the Boys of NYC, yes, to the boys. Guster played fantastically, and they really had the crowd's full attention.. it was great to be in such an enthusiastic audience...Guster and Ben Folds played Boy With the Arab Strap as an encore (by Belle and Sebastian), and Ben also played Late ( a tribute to Elliott Smith)...Ben kweller showed up at the end, and the last song topped EVERYTHING off...it was Ben Folds salsa version of a guster song..but it never ended...it went on for 10 minutes. and everybody just ROCKED OUT...it was an immense concert, and it has to be one of my best...   p.s. Siren Fest on saturday - yay! for death cab! and trail of dead! and har mar!

      Those of you who have been honored enough to receive a collection of songs colloquially called a mix from me know that i take mixes very seriously. yeah, what i just said was pretentious, i know; bare with me. in the past few years, i came to a revelation about music in general. When you listen to music your listening to an auditory art form. Just like art today, its not meant just to be pretty. within the skillfully crafted rhythym, and the oh-so-carefully worded lyrics lies something more sinister. First, i have to distinguish something. There is music, and then there is commercial music. Music examples are Franz Ferdinand, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, Charlie Parker, Bach, Debussy, and Beethoven. Commercial music is not crafted, it is designed for the sole purpose of making money. Everybody inevitably says "isnt that the point for all musicians these days?" The answer is no. The musicians mentioned above each had a desire to communicate through song, and to help relate a common cause or theory. Commercial musicians, i.e. MTV spewed crap, were designed not necessarily to communicate, but to fuel the money making machine; this is not to say that it doesnt sound pleasant, but there is simply no substance. Now, i sound like a total asshole/snob/pretentious erodite fuck by saying that, but its really what i believe. now i have cleared that up i return to my original topic of mixes. A mix is a carefully crafted playlist of songs. Each mix, in my view, has a "soul" to it. You cant just throw together any random songs, that would just be shuffling your fuckin music library. A mix conveys much much more. There are simply good music mixes which are meant to have nothing but good music on them, and those are important too; because, in the end its good music. But a crafted mix composed of meaningful and carefully picked songs has the ability, just like the songs, to convey something more to the listener. You can tell a story, you can create an emotional rollercoaster, you can create a soothing prozac mix, you can create a mix which bursts forth with mounds of energy which just makes you want to sing at the top of your lungs. Mixes, in the end become an art form. Just like Van Gogh's "Starry Night", you can create the feeling of that cool blue star-lit city with the perfect set of songs.  Many people ask why i confront a mix with same ferocity and dedication as i would with a piece of my art, and i give them the same reason i give with my art, "because i care".   songs are my paint, and mixes are my canvases  this is why its an honor to receive a perfectly crafted mix from anyone. Your not just getting a cd which might be nice to listen to; your getting a little window into that person, and your getting a piece of audible art.

      the beauty of photography is that you can capture a moment in time. there is a sliver of time in each negative, in each exposure. we fly through time barely noticing any of the details, i.e. the good stuff. with a photograph you can notice the extra petal or thorn on the flower, the freckle that wasnt there before, the distinguishing features in a lovers face. we pass all this by without the slightest grimace, but with a photography we pause time for that instant, and capture it within our own frame. a photographers duty, or at least what i believe, is to take these moments, and to convert them into something meaningful. you dont just take a "pretty picture", you express something. thats why its an honor to be called a photographer. an honor.

      a question came up involving the level of standard involved with my past few blogs...it is true, they have been slipping away from me. the entries are more accounts rather than intellectual concerns, more memory than thought. but, as i sit here and ponder why this has occurred, i came to the realization that these memories, accounts, and happenings all add up to total life. from these piles of experience, emotion, actions, and involvements i find ammunition for my intellectual pursuits. how can we examine life, if we never live it?  these memories, be they comic relief or not, play an integral role in the development of future thoughts and ideas.   so now, it seems i am back on top of my commentary on life...my more involved words, and more thoughtful comments are flooding back to me, but all come with the experience of life.   over and out oliver

      it seems that every time i enter NYC ridiculous things begin to occurr which are worthy enough (or at least i think so) of talking about in my dear sweet old journal. i visited the city with Scott, Sarah, and John THomas ALL Wash Uers...we walked around contemplating whether or not we should eat and eventually ate at a place called elmos. scott, being the vegan he is had to send back his food due to BUTTERED bread. it was a shame...as we left our brunching we continued to walk downtown towards the village, as we were walking it began to rain, then pour and then hurl buckets of water....and if you can believe it our only shelter was Fantasy World...a sex shop...so we spent 30 minutes parusing teh shelves of the most perverse and awkward shop i have ever been in. it was made all the better by scott screaming the name of everything he saw... many discussions about flavors and leather emerged during this 30 minute interlude in NYC...as hte rain died down we got out of there, and we headed over to Rice to Riches (a tapioca bar)... after delicious rice pudding we just sat and talked about Scott's origami affair, and college that loomed ahead of us. we somehow ended up in a magic shop and were being magicked by a magician named ALbert Cadabra..yeah...all fun and games...eventually we walked to union square and made our way home...now that i write this i realize that perhaps it wasnt totally necessary for me to write this, but it wasnt totally necessary for you to read it either.  good day to you fine ladies and gentlemen like a record baby

      Today, was absolutely ridiculous....ridiculously awesome, and strange, and bad, and happy, and awesome again....  after work, i had made plans to pick up Evan and head into the City to see Sufjan Stevens (a folk singer)...the plan was to drive in to the city from Katonah...so i had directions and all, and we eventually made it (and skipped a toll while we were at it)...we then called Trev to get directions to South Street Seaport and he told us or at least we heard 19th street...so we parked at 19th street and were walking around, and eventually we asked someone how to get to South Street Seaport. so, we were 27 blocks off, and 10 minutes late...so ev and i took a cab down and eventually made it at some expense....when we finally got there, the opening band hadnt started, and we met Trev....so the opening band wasnt very good, but they were decent. Alyssa and Liz(trev's girlfriend) showed up, and we all had a party... Evan and I just repeated the words after the Silent League, basically being really annoying (maga maga maga magazine).....yeah....so Sufjan Stevens was amazing. He has an incredible voice and his songs were well crafted and soothing to listen to...it was the most surreal  concert i have ever been to because everybody was sittting down on teh dock...everybody was...i have never been to a concert where people sat the entire time...but it was lovely...Alyssa and I talked for the whole thing, and it was great to get to know her a little better....this concert was the most hipsterriffic thing i have ever been to....all in all the highlight of the entire concert was when Sufjan, and his band, sang the most beautiful rendition of Star Spangled Banner ever....if it was always sung that way, i would be more proud to sing it...it was really a moving song...  sunkching- v. to hit someone in the head with fingerling banannas.       once the concert finished, we piled into two cabs and got to my car, where i drove all the way CROSS TOWN, and UPTOWN to 116th and broadway, where we had dinner and bubble tea. the bubble tea was good, and so was dinner. so after this it begins to get weird.... weirdest comment of the night: "Its basically abortion" said by Liz to Evan referring to his bubble tea.....  WANTED ASIAN FEMALE ROOM MATE   as well as some other weird things.... so Trev and Liz get on the 1 down to catch their train, adn we head out...as we are trying to get onto the west side highway, i make a turn, and a cop pulls me over saying that it was illegal. i swear by my britches that i turned with a green light, but this cop thought otherwise...he asked for license and registration, asked what i was doing, went to his car, came back gave me everything back asked where i was headed and left...thats it...no ticket or anything...it was so weird, and i was totally weirded out...Evan is convinced that i should buy a lottery ticket because the chances of that ever happening are 1 and a million...oh well, im one in a million waht can i say... so we are driving driving driving down teh west side highway, and get onto the Saw Mill, and the hutch, and my gas light goes on...evan has been warning me constantly about how much gas i had...i left home with a half tank this morning...and now it was on the E...so i decided to pull off at New Rochelle to find a gas station...we drive and drive and drive and drive, we ask a drunk guy and he points us in the right direction.....we get to this gas station, and its closed, but it has a credit card slot, so it should work...it doesnt, we are almost out of gas and it is 11 30....so we drive and drive, and eventually find a mobil station and fill up...but it was weird, because i am normally the most responsible driver...never gets tickets, never runs out of gas, never gets lost...all that changed on the night i needed it not too...its sad...so i was flustered, and Alyssa and Ev calmed me down, and all was good....  in the end, the night was awesome and it was adventurous and an experience. it was one of the best nights this summer just because of the memories i will have from it...im sorry, Evan, if your mom gets mad or stops you from driving with other people....im sorry Alyssa if you came home tooo late and your parents were mad...cest lavie...  ill be lighter than an Oreck vacuum cleaner- Evan  FIREWORKS! Will someone at least say OOOO, AAAA?????????  LOOK! There's ANOTHER cop!- Alyssa as she points to her third taxi  They are all half-asian....  the fates shined and frowned on me today..... oliver
