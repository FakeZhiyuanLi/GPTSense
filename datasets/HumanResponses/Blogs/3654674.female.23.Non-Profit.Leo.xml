      OK..this is gonna be brief. there are all kinds of folks that want to get online.  aah ok lets just share what is going on right now.  we are circling the flying J truckstop parking lot for the millionth time because christy is huddled soaped up in the shower cause the gray water tank is full so the water wont run.  first we thought we ran out of water so drove and filled it up, but that was only part of the problem.  so she has been huddled and soapy for damn long time.  meanwhile robin has the fridge open with the unprotected eggs ready to fly out and join the beer, maple syrup and dish soap that have all spilled all over the floor.  alright...i should be online tomorrow to check in.  perhaps i will try the audio post too.  have fun all of you normal living people.

      currently i sit on my brother's bed over looking mission st in SF! never would have thought that i would be here now, but its pretty fucking sweet.  ok so basically it took forever to get here, blah blah, running down terminal at Phoenix for connection, blah blah blah.  anyways....  showed up at zacks last night dropped my shit in his room and was immediately handed a PBR.  screw the fact that it was something like 1AM to my body.  i got to meet zack's roommates and their friends from back home in OR.  finally got to put a face to a name with josh after hearing and reading about MfA.  i heard all about what  urlLink Music for America  has been up to, very sweet.  after we kicked the beers we headed over to a nearby bar, very cool, with a burning man sorta feel.  got to have a glass of Fat Tire from a tap, man i havent had any of that in a damn long time, good beer.   however, little bro is still little and underage.  we tried to have him fade into the background but she asked for his ID.  poor innocent one answered truthfully and said he was 20.  the bartender thought it was cute and probably would have let him stay if he had said he was 21 but didnt have ID on him.  poor little zackie as iana would say.  ok shower time then head over to Berkeley to meet up with the MAY guys.

      all right, i really should be getting ready for bed, but something tells me that i wont get a very good night sleep tonght (too excited).  i fly out for SF tomorrow afternoon and will be staying w/my lil bro :D.  hopefully, i will get a chance to see Jo and Pete (fyff) while i am out in Cali.  stay tuned for hopefully fairly regular updates, i do have a laptop coming with me, but who knows how often i will get access.  political thought for the evening:  tonight Kos has a  urlLink post up  about Dean being a potential Veep.  as much as i admire the man, i really dont think he is the best man to match  urlLink Kerry  right now.  if i had my choice i would go w/Edwards.  it was fun to dream of the power of a Kerry/McCain ticket, but reality sets in, despite the large respect i have for the man, he still has mostly right viewpoints.  at least he has principles (plus he is the only well-known politician i have ever met in person).  rugby thought for the evening: despite being totally bumned that i will not be joining the MARFU U-23 team in Blaine this weekend (for the third time this year), i am excited for my upcomming trip.  hey emily, just suck up to the coaches really bad, maybe pretend to flirt with them by throwing rugby balls at them and you will get some playing time. :P

      and this is why i love the internet, for its ability to connect people together  every morning  urlLink Bill in Portland  on  urlLink dailyKos  writes his cheers and jeers for all to read.  it is always the highlight of my morning, the man makes me laugh out loud on a daily basis.   his diary lets people share in his joys and dissapointments and express their own.  for months now i have been reading stories about Bill and his partner, reading him rail against the FMA and the like.  today i happened to read on  urlLink 365gay.com  that Maine is  urlLink allowing for DP (domestic partner) registries .  i immediately though of Bill and wanted to know if he an his partner were registering.  so what did i do, i posted a comment on his dairy asking.  he writes back and says:   YES!      We weren't able to drive up to Augusta, but we're going through the online paperwork.   This is a big deal.  It means that, if one partner dies, their property and posessions and other assets automatically go to the other partner.  Sounds kinda like marriage, don't it?    The religious right is choking on their own spittle up here...but there's not a damn thing they can do about it.    Let me type that again, because it's been a long time coming:    There's not a  damn  thing they can do about it. There's  not  a damn thing they can do about it. There's not a damn thing they can  do  about it. There's not a damn  thing  they can do about it.    And since God speaks directly to me, I can tell you that he and Jesus have a rainbow flag hanging from the balcony of their condo in West Heaven.   CHEERS!   how wonderful is it to share in the joy of someone i have never met.  i am grinning from ear to ear, once again struck by the power of the internet.  the power of the web is people interacting.  it is not some static webpage created by a fortune 500 company.  it is people sharing their joys, trumphs and tears with everyone in the world.  this is what motivates me every morning.  to tap into that power and bring more people together.  to share simple joys or to elect a new president.  so mazel tov Bill to you and your partner and anyone else sharing their life with the world.  don't stop, keep talking and this world will be a better place.

      on a happy note, my  urlLink diary on dKos  today generated as of now 45 comment and 88 poll votes.  god i love the power of the Internet.    how to generate debate: tie Republicans and gays together in one topic, the week of debate on the FMA.  interestingly, there was very little dissent from my main claims    1) those who happen to be LCRs did not form their political philosophy based on their sexual preference  2) when they became LCRs there was little possible hope that gay marriage would be feasible anytime soon  3) they are starting to have to reconsider who they back, not just on this one issue, but the fact that the Republicans are not acting like true conservatives in the vein of McCain    on a unhappy note: my job search starts in earnest tonight. as much as i am truely dedicated to the goals of Common Cause it is time to move on.  if anyone out there in the blogosphere has a tip, feel free to email me.    rugby note:  7s is a great way to get an awful tan and a chance to get to know ruggers that are my own age.

      is this really a surprise?  not with how the conservatives (bush administration) operates.  we have heard eccos of this in regards to AIDS research, academics having to change the language not to refer to homosexuality directly.  Mireya Navarro of the NYTimes writes today:  "Mr. Wagoner is among the professionals in sex-related fields who have started speaking out against what they say is growing interference from conservatives in and out of government with their work in research, education and disease prevention.  A result, these professionals say, has been reduced financing for some programs and an overall chilling effect on the field, with college professors avoiding certain topics in their human sexuality classes and researchers steering clear of terms like sex workers in the title of grant applications for fear of drawing attention to themselves."  the world today has changed.  a time when research can not be honestly talked about or sponsored harkens to communism.  the united states government was set up to make sure that those in control cannot easily impose their thinking on others.  unfortunately, very few are willing to stand up to the bullies.

      in the last couple of days  urlLink articles  have been written about the outing of GLBT legislators and staffers as a tactic in the fight against the FMA.  this troubles me very much, coming out is a very personal experience and should be done on our own terms.  the proponents argue this (from the DC Blade's southern sister paper  urlLink Southern Voice .  "So who are we talking about? Semi-closeted Hill staffers who happily play in gay D.C. but who work in positions of authority with real influence over members of Congress who support an amendment to the United States Constitution that would prohibit states from legalizing marriage, civil unions or even domestic partner registries for gay couples."  however a friend of a coworker had a coworker call asking about a staffer who is involved with foreign policy.  while they may have influence over their boss, it may not necessarily relate in any way to the FMA.  the Southern Voice goes on to say:  "IF EVER THERE were a definition of a gay Uncle Tom, it would fit these people. These are not dishwashers or short-order cooks at Cracker Barrel, facing poverty if their redneck bosses learn they’re big homos.  These are smart, talented, well-educated professionals who could find success in any number of highly paid positions on or off the Hill but who instead have chosen to devote their professional lives to advancing the careers of politicians who would strip them and their friends of basic civil rights protections and even redress of their grievances in the courts."  very true, but then the author says:  The level of rationalization and denial it must take for these people to show up for work each day must be mind-boggling. Add to that their newfound paranoia that an activist — or even the gay press —might reveal their sexual orientation, and thereby their hypocrisy, and you have some pretty unhappy people about whom all of us should feel absolutely no sympathy whatsoever."  the last clause troubles me the most.  as the daughter of a therapist, sympathy and understanding are one of the most crucial emotions human beings have to be able to relate to one another in a positive constructive way.  there has to be a reason why these people have made the conscious choice to stay inside the closet to some degree.  we do not have the right to judge that for them.  it is much more effective to lobby them directly and give them a chance to respond than publicly out them.  what influence would they really have on their boss if they were forced out?  after all the bosses know they were most likely only acting under duress.

      i just havent been online for a couple of weeks on a consistent basis to post.  actually i just realized that i have not had a full 5 day work day of work since the beginning of may.  there have been 2 rugby tournaments, visit home, memorial day, independence day and the march across america.  perhaps next week i will be around for 5 days straight.  blog moment of the day: realization that it was a mechanic for usairways that first broke the news that edwards was the veep pick.  he saw kerry's plane being repainted in a hanger and posted on a aviation site.  you can read more  urlLink here  including links to the original post.  zackie says he heard about it last night from a buddy.  i was too busy driving back from the beach where edwards was  urlLink visiting .
