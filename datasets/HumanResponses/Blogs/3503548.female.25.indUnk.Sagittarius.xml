      ....To this blogging thing. Funny thing is, one of my "friends" was doing this and we found it on the internet....and he was talking all kinds of crap about EVERYONE! So I guess I should stay away from talking about people! I don't quite get this yet or understand it's purpose, but why not give it a shot hey. So what does everyone write about? Feelings? What went on in the day? I guess I'll have a looksy around and see!

      So here I am work, wanting so bad for it to be 5:00 so that I can go home. I usually don't get off until 6, but I had to come in early today to cover for someone else who isn't here.  I am sooooo tired I can barely stay awake!! Bubbs and I were up pretty late talking about "us" and how all of this hurts me so much. And then I couldn't fall asleep until about 4:30am. My heart was beating so fast, I have no idea why?? Whatever. I want to leave work to go home, but don't want to because my dad will be there and he has been such a bug lately. Where's this, where's that? What are you doing? .....It is like being a defendent in a courtroom! Urg it bothers me!! Well I guess I better get back to my job, more typing!

      Its late and I am all emotional. Me and the man have been going through some weird times lately and it is really taking its toll on me I think. I feel like I feel so much for him sometimes and I feel that he doesn't feel the same. It sucks! Sometimes I just wanna hear how he feels so I can feel like we are on the same page, I guess it would be kinda comforting. Well I need to go to bed, don't wanna be bitchy tomorrow! :-)

      So James is a lying cheater! Turns out the whole time we were dating, he was STILL going out with his ex girlfriend of 6 years. She had no idea about me either, and the poor girl is only 18. She is gonna stay with him and work things out! I am still in so much shock! This all happened about 2 weeks ago, 4 days before he was to leave fot Wymoning for a year and a half. I am so glad though that I caught that cheating lying son of bitch! He was speachless! I slapped him across the face so hard!!! He lied to me EVERY SINGLE day, more than once, for the last 10 months, and I am so disgusted!! So if any of you women ever come across a man by the name of James Paul Adkins, stay away! He is the most selfish, heartless, lying bastard you will ever meet!!!
