      chatted with mah ex just now.. not joey.. my 1st gf.. hes tha currect gf of my friend kenny.. holy cow.. i really wonder how kenny can stand her.. she msg me 1st 1st.. and we started chattin.. 1st we were talkin bout her stuff with kenny.. i told her to appreciate kenny.. and blah blah.. and she always take kenny's feelin for granted.. seriously if i were kenny i would threw her into the mlk river and feel the staving crocs.. hahaha then she started chattin bout me.. and thats why made me angry.. as far i as i can remember, our chattin session always ending up like this.. i got angry and the session ends.. she talks without thinkin much.. its like whatever she thinks she'll say.. if its true, i dont mind.. but most of it are her assumptions.. holy cow.. she said my ex [joey] still loves me .. blah blah.. blek blek.. then i shouldnt have break.. lala lele.. then outta sudden she points the gun towards me and start shootin.. saying im bad la to treat joey like that.. say cuz of me shes very sad la.. say cuz of me she lost trust on guys la.. then ask me go think what ive done to her.. and go think does she deserve that.. and say im cruel la and say i this kinda ppl duno how to appreciate.. blaH! how much does she knows bout me and jo? shes not even a close friend of joey.. needless to say bout me.. yeah when i broke with jo i hurt her alot.. and frankly.. i was very guilty bout it.. we been through everything for more than a year.. those memories is enough to kill.. thinkin bout those time&nbsp;we spent together.. really makes me dont wanna leave joey.. and yeaH i still love&nbsp;her then.. i lied i lost my feelin already.. just to make her give up on me.. i was selfish then.. but i was having a hard time also.. seriously i cant concentrate in my studies.. and when reachin the end of the relationship that time.. we always quarrel.. everytime we quarrel.. it hurts inside.. and at nite i'll keep thinkin bout it.. and its like.. even in class i keep thinkin bout it.. its like a kinda worry.. or whatever feelin its called.. u always think bout it.. and it isnt a happy thing to think about.. yet u cant help it as it always haunt ur mind.. this kinda feelin goes on for 3 months.. if im not wrong.. though i pretended nothing happened.. and yeah.. in between the last 3 months we had some happy time too.. but the few days of mental torment is enough to kill me.. im that kinda of guy who always wanna be carefree.. this kinda thing makes me feel like.. urgh.. givin up everything and dont wanna bother anymore.. and yeah i did.. for my own good.. ignoring joey feelin.. i was guilty for the 1st few months.. and then things got better... i got over it.. and to tell ya the truth.. single life is carefree.. i'm happy with it ... though it can be lonely sometimes but its a small price to pay lak.. like as i said .. if i ever wanna start i new 1 .. the girl will be the 1 i very love.. and i'll sacrifice to make it last... but.. ahh.. not easy to find that kinda girl... sometimes we see pretty girls, we admire... but to love.. u need to know that girl.. to know so well that u can predict her next word she gonna utter.. and yet accepting everything that she is.. from the looks to the heart =) hahaha blah.. im talking too emo-ly.. blah its my journal anyway.. i write whatever i want here.. today i read a book in my friend's house.. its like.. bout coping with life's obstacles... it says when we face a problem in life, if we dont solve it, bigger problem of it will surface.. until the moment u solve it and learn a lesson from it..&nbsp;how true uh.. hahaha  &nbsp;  -peKie-  [ =)= ]

      "She Will Be Loved" Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get so insecure  It doesn't matter anymore It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved..

      "Verse 1  If I die tonight  What would I do  On my last day  I know I'd wake early  In the morn' for crack  Of dawn's last pray  Then prolly go for breakfast  Like I used to do  Fried kuey teow FAM  And roti canai at Raju's  With my boo  And friends from way back  Neighborhood homies  Extended fam  They only know me  As that same cat  With that shaved head  Rocking Cross Colors  Sneaks to school  Writin' rhymes at the back of class  Playing tricks on fools  Then I'd come back to the crib  Tidy up a bit  Y'all know my room's messy  Though classy  Start arrange my ish  Line up my shoes one by one  Start with Jordans  And end with them Air Force Ones  Put a Post-it on the tongue  Of each one  With the name of each dun  I think I know my homies  And who would want which one  Get on the phone  And holla' at everybody  It's nearly noon  Gots to have lunch  With the family  Then spend the last day  I don't know  Try do a million other things  Hoping somehow  Time will slow  I guess what  I'm trying to say is  Take everyday  Like it was your last  Work towards your dreams  Before you pass  And have a blast  While you at it  'Cause we don't know  When we go go  So make the best of it  Just keep it real to yourself  And to all people  If y'all lost somebody before  Remember there'll be a sequel    Chorus (2x)  If I die tonight  You know it'll be alright  Just smile for me  Reminisce the fond memories    Verse 2  Well if I die tonight  I wonder  Where I'll be tomorrow  Nobody cry please  Push away the sorrow  'Cause I ain't been  The best of men  The best of friends  The best of mom  And daddy's last son  The best of anything  Tell Joe here's a last one  If I die tonight  Would I be forgiven  By all the people  I been slackin' with  When I was livin'?  Those who I hurt their hearts  Took advantage of  And even lied to  Hug you one last time  For forgiveness  Yeah I would like to  If I die tonight  Would you feel the loss?  Tomorrow would you dial  My number by accident  Then suddenly... pause?  If I die tonight  I wonder who would get  To keep my caps and shoes  Jerseys, even my little  Stuffed crocodile Coco too  Get my cell phone  Message everyone from A to Z  Tell 'em this ain't Malique  He passed away last night  And pray he rest in peace  If I die tonight  Would you think of my room  When you see blue  Wanted to clean it up this morning  But then I never knew  If I die tonight  What would happen to Tim  How long would it take  Before she kissed another man?...  God damn...  At fast food joints  Would she still order  The same combo meal for two?  Things I wish I knew...    Chorus (2X)  If I die tonight  You know it'll be alright  Just smile for me  Reminisce the fond memories    Verse 3  A cute lil' thing  To many eyes  To me you were simply  A beautiful thing  I tell no lies  We went from  Mere invisible friends  To pals real tight  Rendezvous up on the net  To chitty chat all night  I used to pick you up  Until you got your own ride  A slammin' two door whip  A grey 36-72  Lookin' all slick  Remember when I asked why this  You said because it's real fast  So you can rush  To see your boy after class  The last time  We met was '01 September  You left feelin' upset over... something  I can't remember...  I never apologized  Till January 10th 2003  When I heard you passed away  When I was deep in my sleep  Your loss taught me  Not to take my friends for granted  Misunderstandings  Gotta slam it quick  Death you never plan it  You're sorely missed down here Wawyn  Rest in peace  This too shall pass  But our true friendship will never cease...  Love...    Chorus (till end)  If I die tonight  You know it'll be alright  Just smile for me  Reminisce the fond memories.."  thats a full song of too phat... a song that's dedicated to their close late pal wawyn.. who passed away in year 2003.. =\ meaningful song huh..  yeaH.. i went to the planet shaker's peformance.. their songs were cool ignoring the lyrics.. =P ima free thinker.. no offence to all christians.. =P probably they're classified in a genre called "god rock".. haHaha =P they aint no punK.. no spike hairs no punk shoes.. no tattoos either.. they aint no metal.. thier songs arent that heavy.. hmm.. so i created a new genre and fit them in..
