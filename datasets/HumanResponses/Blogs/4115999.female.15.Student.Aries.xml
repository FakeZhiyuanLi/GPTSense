        Well, the summer is coming to a fast end, which means I must go back to the boring monotonis life back in Hillsboro. I'm going to miss being at my dads so much, I have had so much fun these past two months. It was so great not having to deal with John. I'm going to miss all the new people I met while here, its kinda sad. I don't think I'll miss Austin that much just because I won't. But I'll miss seeing people like Lisa, Antonia, Denim and Drew. They've been cool to hang   out with even if it wasn't that much. But I guess I am looking forward to seeing some people, like Kim Cortney Jessica Mindy Katielynn Sarah and some other people too. This was a really big summer for me, I don't think I'm as shy as I used to be at the end of school. It's going to be  so great when mom and I move at the beginning of October. La la la. I have this freakishly huge bruise on my right thigh from trying to skateboard. I don't think I'm ever going to get good at that, I fall t oo much. Woot, I am somewhat tan!!! But not that much. Hmm, I want some hot coco, but its to warm to have that. Last night was fun, I went to Lisa's at like a 'lil bit after 6pm an   d we played Mario cart for like an hour or something till her parents got home. Then we went outside, and I attempted to ollie multiple times and came very close to doing it, but sadly I didn't. Then, Drew and Brandon came walking down the street and sat by use in Lisa's front yard, it was odd we just kinda threw grass back and forth and thanks to Lisa I had the whole front yard down my shirt. After a lil bit we ended up playing kick ball with Lisa's two little brothers Kevin an  d Ryan, and Kevins two friends Doug and...umm....I don't remember the other ones name....He kinda freaks me out anyway. Dougs pretty cute he's 14 I think and turning 15 in like two months or something that. But anyway, the teams were Lisa, me, Dr ew and Brandon. Then the other peoples were together. We won!!! Woot woot!!! Happy dance!!!......I love the happy dance its so goo d! Lol. If you people haven't checked out www.homestarrunner.com you need too and watch teen girl squad, its so good! I think I pulled a muscle in my bum. It hurt. Well I'm going go so I'll talk to you people later!

       woot I went shopping with mom yesterday for school stuff it was fun I guess, but I was so tired afterwards. Then around I dunno maybe 5, I met Antonia for a little "get together" cause it was her  birthday. We stayed at her house for like three hours, then we drove to Washington Courthouse to go skating, little did we know they weren't open....So we drove back to Wilmington and rented some movies but we only watched one of them, Cabin Fever, it was pretty good, I'd seen it before thou  gh. It was fun I guess. Today I have no clue what I'm doing, might hang out with some people, it all depends I guess. I'm so bummed that school is happening again this year...Woo go teen girl squad!!! lol... Yeah it starts Monday, which sucks monkey toes, but oh well nothin I can do about it. At least I get to see some people I haven't seen since school let out. Yeah, I'm going to go my fingers are getting tired...

      I am so confused. I think I fell to hard and to fast and wishing that you felt the same way, I took things way to far for the short time I had known you. I would never act like that in my normal setting of life in Hillsboro, and I think this started because it was something I could control, or atleast I thought I could. When things started out they were great, I didn't worry about what was next or how you felt, but now.....Its like tension all the time, or like your always in another state of mind when we're together. I would like to have a serious talk with you but you would just laugh it off or change the subject, but whatever.

      By Jewel  Please dont say I love you, those words touch me much too deeply and they make my core tremble Don't think you relize the power you have over me And please dont kiss me so sweet It makes me crave a thousand kisses to follow And please dont touch me like that makes every other embrace seem pale and shallow Please don't look at me like that It just makes me want to make you near me always  Please don't send me flowers they only whisper the sweet things you'd say Don't try to understand me your hand already know too much anyway It just makes me wanna make you near me always  And when you look in my eyes please know my heart is in your hands It's nothing that I understand, but in your arms you have complete power over me So be gentle if you please 'cause Your hands are in my hair but my heart is in your teeth And it makes me want to make you near me always I want to be near you always I want to be near you always I want to be near you always Please don't look at me like that It just makes me want to make you near me always

      Today has been a crazy insane day. It started off horrible, but its getting better.  I'm at my dads, thank God.  I'll probably be here for a week or two, hopefully. I really don't want to go back to Hillsboro untill school starts. Eh I guess I'm going to go.

       It is such a crappy day it been raining for awhile which means I can't really walk around town eventhough I have no reason to. I go back to Hillsboro tomorrow around 7pm, I really don't want to but my cat, Carmen, is being declawed and I have to take care of her while moms at work. Hopefully I'll come back to dads sunday or monday and say awhile. Being here helps pass time faster untill we move out from John, when I'm there I'm always all sad and depressed but here I'm like WOO lol. I'm really nervous about school starting again, so much about me and about my friends has changed to much over the summer.   Like, Melissa (cheese)  getting a job even though today was her first day its still weird because its one of the steps in her life being "all grown up" lol. I am no where near as shy as I was when school let out, I have some people to thank for that.  It's so weird to think that in three years I'll be out of school and going off to collage somewhere, hopefully NYU or UC.  Frankly, I am so terrified about not being able cope with whats to come in the next chapters of my life, but I am gratefull for all my friends because I know that they will always be there me, and thats really comforting.  Dude my friends are so awesome, they're so random and funny. But I'm goin go, cause all this mushy stuff is gettin to me.

      OMG...I hate this computer I had a lot of stuff typed and ready to publish and guess what?! It freezes! I lost all of it. Well anyway, this guy called at 5:30 in the freakin morning asking for someone named Jenny....Well it took awhile for me to convince him that no one named Jenny lives here. I swear it was so aggravating. Well, dad doesn't get home till like 11 tonight, kinda cool. I really want to go to the mall this weekend, I feel like shopping. I want to go to Sweden. Don't know why just do. Geez...I am so bored, I need to do something....Maybe I'll go for a run or something. Eh maybe not it's kinda hot outside. Plus I'm way to lazy for that type of thing. Well, I have nothing else to bore you with at the moment.

       *blank stare* It's kinda late but I have no intension of going to bed anytime soon, even though my eyes are excruciatingly tired, but oh well. Is ponderment a word? I guess so. I feel like sky-diving anyone wanna join me? When will I ever meet a guy that I truly c  onnect with. I like someone now, but I pretty sure they don't like me like I like them, but oh well I suppose. I have a deep feeling for a serious relationship like a few of my friends, but I'm not predicting that anytime soon in the forecast of my boring "love life" or "like life" whatever you want to call it. Eh, I got to sneeze....Just thought I'd let you all know that. Welp, my fingers are tired so ITS OVER!!!
