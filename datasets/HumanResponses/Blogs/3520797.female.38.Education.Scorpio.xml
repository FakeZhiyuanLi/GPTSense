      Just got back from northern Michigan today after having been gone for 10 days.  Have done 3 loads of laundry so far and am ready to drop dead... waiting for the dryer to stop and hoping for an IM from D.  D is really on my mind all the time now, like a stain.  I like this stain though... I am working hard not to fall fast for him, to take one thing at a time, to live "in the moment".  All of this is not in my nature though, and I want him now, I want it all now!   He was on the phone with a college friend when I got him tonight - he said he'd be back on IM but then never was.  I'm not sure what to make of this... was hoping he'd be glad to talk, welcome me back, all that good stuff.  I did talk to him yesterday though so I shouldn't be making a big deal out of it.  But of course I'm obsessing already... wondering why he didn't call or IM back when he got off the phone.  Could be any number of good reasons.  I just miss him and wanted to talk, to set something up for this week.  Had a GREAT time up at the cabin.  We suprised my mom with a 60th bday party and about 20 of her closest friends and relatives.  She was very happy with the whole deal and it really worked out well.  My sister, aunts and uncles and I did all the preparation.  Keeping the secret was hard - I tend to give off a "somethings up" look on my face and can't usually hold back something I'm excited about.  I go back up north here in less than 2 weeks :)  Can't wait for that.  Am so ready for the down time again - this time it's solo and I hope to get my head together on some personal issues and begin to move forward with some lifestyle changes.  I'm not so unrealistic as to think I can change everything in a week, but I'm going to try to get started.  Would like to write more, and more often, but have been busy, away or just plain pooped.  Want to make something more of this blog but right now you'll have to settle for this.  Ciao!

      Man, I thought I would be able to blog every night or at least every other night but I've been crazy busy and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight.  I am counting days (8) until I'm on vacation.  I need it sooooooooooo bad.  Problem is, I'm going to have to kill myself working late so I can feel OK about leaving my job in the state that it's in.  I so want to be caught up!  I'm sure I'll get there before the students get back, but usually I'm in an easier pace and get more rest and have steady productivity.  Part of my problem has been a lack of focus due to the office dynamics but that will change soon enough.  So much is on my mind... I have met someone on e-harmony who, so far, I have really clicked with.  He seems taken with me, and I'm hoping that I don't disappoint.  We are going to meet in person next week and I'm really excited about it.  He's funny, smart, quirky, full of energy, has a great voice, laugh, my age, taller than me, motivated, accepting, and hey, he thinks I'm beautiful!  Of course I gave him an array of pictures of me - from thin to now and I was up front about the now.  He doesn't seem to be shallow and he has struggled with weight too so he understands.    If he likes me "for me" and can accept me this way, when I do shed my protective layer, he's going to have a total package.  Maybe I can replace food with sex?  Ha ha ha!  He's really an interesting, unique person.  He seems intense.  We're both Scorpios, and I've read that could be bad.  I've experiences that before with an old boyfriends.  Lots of fireworks.  Well, enough for now.  I hope to keep this blog going but may not be able to get into the rhythm for a while.  I'll be on the road to Ohio this weekend.  Good Night Blogland!

      I took today and tomorrow off work and my intentions were to be very, very productive.  Two of my college friends are coming to visit me from Cleveland this weekend and I am so unprepared!  I moved into my house last fall and have yet to mop the floor.  Now, that might sound gross, but truthfully it does not look too bad!  I live alone and am pretty neat and tidy most of the time.  Well, I used to be at least.  Lately I don't know if it is that I don't care anymore or that I'm just way too tired to do anything but go to work.  Half crazy, half lazy.  There it is again!  I have depression and rheumatoid arthritis and both kind of drain me.  Plus... damn sinus infection or allergies or something is taking hold of my head.  I'm not a hypochondriac, really I'm not.  I'm tired of being tired.  I know to feel energetic, you have to put out some energy.  I need to get off my ass and do some walking.  I know this would be very good for my mood and my joints, yet I don't do it.  A wierd form of self sabotage.  Why?  It's like cleaning my house.  No one is going to know if I do it or not, unless I tell them.  And if I don't care, why bother?  But why don't I care?  I mean, life is pretty good for me right now.  My arms and legs work, I have a job, I just got a new car that I love.  Friday is payday.  I have friends and family.  Sure I'd love to be married and to have no worries, but as humanity goes, I'm living in the lap of luxury and I am grateful.  I try not to get bogged down in any woe is me modes because it's a waste of time and energy and there are so many people worse off that me in the world.  I'm hoping a new "friend" will send me an email soon... wondering what he is thinking re our relationship.  If he's feeling the friend thing too or is interested in more romantic things.  As for me, I don't feel the sparks.  I like him - he's funny and nice and kind and stable...  but after two dates, a lot of emails and phone calls I just don't get the sparkle in my eye when I think of him.  Do you think that's okay?  I mean I always think I need to feel that within the first few dates or we shouldn't waste each other's time.  Some people think that chemistry can develop over time.  I wonder how much time?    Well, I'm going to play a game of Scrabble.  Maven is set at advanced, which is helping me raise my rating.  I'm not advanced yet, but I'm moving along.  Very exciting, huh?

      I'm really curious about this whole blogging thing and interested to see if anyone reads this.  How much can I reveal in this anonymous kind of forum?  Can I post my deepest, darkest secrets and have assurance that no one will be able to track this back to me?  Can I rant incessantly about people that drive me nuts?  Can I use this as a way to do that daily journaling and writing I'm always avoiding?    Well, here it is.  Welcome to my blog.  I had no idea what to name it ~ my best friend originated the half lazy/half crazy phrase.  We both agree that all psychotherapy would just boil us down to that diagnosis.  Half crazy, half lazy!  Yep, that about covers it.  I don't have to work tomorrow so maybe I'll come back and just ramble on.  Until then... good night!

      Sonofabitch... dumped again.&nbsp; I can't believe it and I don't quite yet understand.&nbsp; I must have been misreading his signals.&nbsp; I didn't think he was a player but maybe he is.&nbsp; It's obvious to me now that the reason I haven't heard from him in 10 days is that he has decided to seek others.&nbsp; But he doesn't have the common courtesy or anything to tell me so.&nbsp; All I need is something from him saying, sorry, this is what I'm doing and why.&nbsp; Then I can move on.&nbsp; I just need closure! &nbsp; I know for sure that he's looking for someone else because he's taken new photos of himself and had them posted on his yahoo profile.&nbsp; When you look at "My Photos" you see like nine different shots of him, and they all have file names like "pers2", "pers3".&nbsp; I don't know if he's using eharmony still or something else.  &nbsp; I'm crushed, yes.&nbsp; And mad.&nbsp; Mad at him for letting me down.&nbsp; Mad at me for getting so hopeful.&nbsp; The last time I saw him it went really well until he got paged into work.&nbsp; Maybe that wasn't a page?&nbsp; Maybe he set that up to use as an escape? &nbsp; Other facets of my life are going well, I'm going to continue to work at things.&nbsp; I have been going to the gym and working out for over two weeks now.&nbsp; I'm in my third week and it feels good!&nbsp; I also gave up caffeine while I was on vacation, so I think that will really help me a lot! &nbsp; Anyway, don't feel much like blogging much tonight.&nbsp; Later.

      Well, I've been to a GYM two whole days in a row!  And I feel GREAT!  Do you think this is just a flash in the pan or will I stick with it?  We shall see.  I certainly hope to keep going every night that I can.  I'm not watching TV at night anymore so it's replacing that ~ takes care of the "I don't have time" excuse.  I have gained and lost a lot of weight and muscle tone over the years.  If I could just harness all the motivation and adrenalin and endorphins that made it work before, and tap into it every day, I'll be fine.  Next week I'll be on vacation and I intend to give up caffeine.  I'll have time and be in a place where I can sleep and bitch and moan and relax and just work through it.  Kind of like a detoxification retreat.  I'm also going to work on writing and taking some pictures.  I've been really wanting to take photos of barns.  I know, sounds nutty, but there are some really neat barns out there and I want to capture them.  Maybe do a poster you know, like Barns of Michigan or something.  I'll have to keep track of where I take them.  I don't think my camera is quality enough to make it real professional though.  I'm still moving along nicely with D.  We are going out Friday night and I can't wait.  The tension is building and I don't know how long I'll be able to hold off.  It's been a loooooooooooooong time.  Ciao.

      I am at a the brink of either a really good relationship or totally screwing things up with D.  I just want to jump in with both feet and hurry up and get to the good stuff.  This whole dating thing.... wondering and worrying about phone calls, does he still like me, did I say something wrong, why haven't I heard from him today, blah blah blah - it's driving me up the freaking wall!  OK, so truth be told.... I have never had a long term relationship in the first place.  Yes, it's sad at my age, but it's true.  I'm ready for one - boy am I ready.  I'm so ready I'm afraid I'm going to screw it up and scare him away.  He says he doesn't scare easily.  When he talks to me he uses futuristic language as if we'll be doing this and that down the road.  He seems so perfect for me so far.  I am so much attracted to him it scares me.  I am both eager and anxious for things to get physical, and I'm also scared to death that he will be turned off by the state of my body.  I think I've hooked him with my mind, and he's proven so far that he's not shallow.  I really think this is going to be the most serious relationship I've ever had... it feels that way.  When I think about him I turn to goo.  We have great chemistry so far.  He's not in a hurry, but I am.  I'm doing really good and trying to chill out.  He is out of town this weekend, and I go out of town next weekend.  We are going to get together this coming Friday night.  We did a lot of joking around on messenger on Friday... very sexual in nature, jokes about packing my suitcase.  It's fun... it's dangerous though, I can't do that again at work.  I think the big brother software we have monitors that kind of thing and I don't want to get caught.  I know of someone who worked at her company for 14 years and started messenging boyfriends during the day and got caught - they had records of every thing, all the time she spent, the words she typed.  That would be so embarrassing.  Even if our IT guy told me it was okay to have messenger, it's still not cool to be mixing work with pleasure every 5 minutes on company time.  I know better.  I joined a gym today!  Yes, I'm on a quest.  Whether things work out with D or not, I have to do this for myself.  It's my own life, my own future, and I want it to be a full healthy one.  I want to live life to it's fullest.  One of the things I am worried about with Doug is my inexperience and body image.  Hopefully I will get an A for effort and desire...  Because of my weight and my arthritis, I'm afraid I won't be as flexible and mobile as would be optimal for both of our enjoyment.  Is that a nice way to say I need to go into training.... for SEX!?  Well, I do.  It's the honest truth :)  OK, so now you know I'm old, horny and insecure.  But hopefully you also see that I'm excited, happy and optimistic.    Happy fourth of July!
