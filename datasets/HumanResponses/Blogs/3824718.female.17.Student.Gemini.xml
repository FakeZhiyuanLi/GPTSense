        wow. I'm so exhausted.&nbsp; so much is going on. Today was out last day of camp and im not to stoked about the way i threw. Monday i did ok which was rather shocking cuz my&nbsp;shoulder&nbsp;didn't hurt. Tuesday i did really well and wednesday i sucked. He wanted to see my drop alot and it just wasn't workin out. So yeah. And then today my shoulder was killing me so i sucked even worse. Anyways this morning the doctor dude called mom and told her that its seperated and he wants to do surgery after the season. The deal is he said it takes 6 to 8 months to heal&nbsp;completely and i only have 4 after highschool ball before for the maverics start up agian. and theres no way i can even go for months with out pitching cuz i'll be screwed. Anyways my dads taking me down to arizona to visit the campus next week and im stoked. I've wanted to play for the wildcats for like..ever. lol.     &nbsp;   Jesse just went back to doing the same things he did before. Pete came over and gave me like the worst most romantic moment of my life. So i'm spending the week at Harlies apartment ~>all by myself :^)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Anyways someone tells jesse that they saw pete's car and that me and him were there alone. not even anything about he was naked lol. And jesse calls me on my cellphone&nbsp; while im in the middle of watching sex and the city so of course i was a little pissed. And he is all chewing me out for having pete there and being "bitchy" about him finding out. And im all flustered cuz i'm missin my damn show for this so im just like look jess i'll call you back later and being the asshole he is he is like "holy jesus he's still there isn't he?" so i just hung up and left the phone off the hook. damn. So i called him at nine and told him what went down and how i "upset" i was that he thought i could do anything to him. (like him thinking i cheated on him would be any big shocker.) So i told him i couldn't take it anymore and broke up with him. And thats where we are now. bye :^)    P.S. Katie Ebbins is coming how from UCLA this weekend so im gunna get to see my favorite 19 yr old in the whole world ( including my sisters lol) LOVE YOU HAYLIE!&nbsp; LOVE YOU HARLIE! heh :^)

      i spent the night at eric's last night. Life is pretty much stinky right now. Everyone thinks i broke up with jesse but i haven't. (atleast not yet)And of course he is being really sweet. i don't know wether its because he knows im not happy or because he is finally over this jealous asshole faze. either way im totally confused. anyways...i went over to eric's last night and we watched a ben stiller movie marathon and i showed him some tape of roger federer ( HOTTIE ). he deffinatly thinks roger is hot cuz he was like salivating the whole time. anywho we just hung out and it was kinda relaxing and then sharon made us hot cocoa and i fell asleep. Anyways this morning we went for a run and then slept some more. i came home and i had 8 missed calls. 2 from allie and the rest from jesse and mom said he called the house alot too. So i guess i should call him back but i don't feel like it yet. Me and eric talked alot about it and i had forgotten how easy he was to talk to about everything so he was really helpful. Now i have ->CC-> camp this week and softball camp next week. Dad has me throwing 600 pitches monday wednesday and friday and 300 tuesday and thursday so im gunna be really tired. Coach Ellington already told us that for CC monday we are running 18 hills 12 400's and 2 miles so its not gunna be fun. he'll probably throw ome stadiums in there 2 if someone doesn't barf before practice is over. anyhow im just not too happy so im gunna go   ~>check out Eye Of The Storm By Blindside

I didn't really have any plans so i was like sure.Jamie and Jesse are really good friends so jamie called jesse and he asked what she was doing for the 4th and she said we were going to the boat.

      i'm so confused about everything right now.i don't even know if me and jesse are even dating...we are kinda just there...its sucks because i used to love to spend time with him because he was so perfect for me...he just...i dunno got me..its crazy now tho. i mean i can't talk to him like i could before. before i didn't even have to tell him how something made me feel cuz he could tell me how it made me feel and he could listen to me talk about how insecure i am and how nothing feels real around me and he always knew what to say. now he just makes me feel like im stupid and tells me that im cheating on him. im not. and we fight so much and he takes everything i say the oposite of how i meant it.Before i met jesse there were like 3 people in the world that had any idea what was going on inside me head at any point in time. I mean brody and allie are my best friends and i think its becuase they have known me for so long that they just understand how i am. and then vaughn was like the *first love* thing and he was the only good thing that happened to me last year. and then he just up and leaves. And right when i feel like im getting over that i meet jesse. I mean he was so cool back then but now it just sucks. it sucks that we were ever that close because now we aren't. and i want so bad to end it because i feel like maybe me and pete could have something but probably not. and everytime i try to tell jesse how im feeling i think about how it used to be and i never say anything...damn.  ~peyton pryce~   CHECK OUT- she's gunna break soon by less than jake
