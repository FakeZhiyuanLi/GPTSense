      I know this is going to sound very weird but bear with me.......  You know how when you watch movies like Emma and well i cant think of the others right now but like they meet some guy and he isnt always the likely one or the most dashing, suave or handsome but yet he has some other special zing we will call it that makes him stand apart. They are always so polite with a sense of respect toward the other and self dignity none of this hi how r u your hott.. lets go out and make out loose our virginity even though i really dont care more than two cents about you mess. i mean granted it happened anyway... they always end up on the lake surounded by trees and peaceful waters shes wearing a pretty, yet modest dress none of this lets see how much cleavage i can hang in his face business... he shows up during the day and wisks her off on a walk through a peaceful forest they chat about everyday stuff they dont dwell on emotions its not important its about getting to know the other...its all about the mystery Nowadays its all about oh hes cute lets date him or shes hot lets see how far i can get with the least amount of talking.. or still there are those normal relationships i know several and its wonderful to see they can have fun just playing pingpong or hanging out with friends they dont always have to be alone they also dont always have to be all over each other I mean what happened to modesty and self respect and you know just like opening the bible and following it I mean God gave us so much and all we have to do is try to at least live by his book it doesnt seem that big compared to all that Gods done for us.... but today thats disregarded people dont always care about those simple things like spending time with the others family or just sitting and actually watching t.v. they only just want to get the most quickly. now the people who dont wear their shirts two sizes to small to wear their boobs hang out or their jeans and skirts so tight and so low they might as well not wear them. Somebody explain to me why its so hot to where a skirt where your butt cheeks are hanging out and your skin tight shirt is sucked above a fat roll? it must be sense people where it... where are the parents these days, or maybe they were never taught... i feel sorry for the kids who were brought up to think this was ok or maybe their parents just dont care. the other day i was walking through the mall and this little girl she couldnt have been more than 4 or 5 was on the little stage outside Libby Lu she was dancing to the music not cutsie little girl twirls or leaps but shake the butt seducive mess i mean your probably thinking how can a 4 year old seduce someone well that must be what shes learning and her parents were clapping can they not see that they are bringing their daughter up to be a common slut?  Everybody claims they want to be different and orginal well ya know being modest sadly has become orginal and different even looked upon as squarish and geeky. How sad is that that we have stooped to that level. you know i dont consider myself a square or a prude but if thats what you have to be called to be decent and follow God's command then I'll deal with that and proudly call myself one. There was also a wonderful article in Seventeen in the June issue i believe about modesty the girl writing said "My guy will love me for more enduring things than my figure"  Also this only helps to reenterate what i said in my last post: "I've learned that you don't have to settle. I've made guy friends that respect me and aprreciate my personality.She also talks about what she will wear this summer;takinis and shorts to the figure tips (my kinda girl!) I agree completely with her in saying " I would rather have had one good conversation with a guy who's interested in who I really am(which is how good relationships start) than have 20 guys hitting on my because of my short skirt.My favorite quote: "Because when it comes down to it, the impression I want to leave with a guy is not "She'd make a great one-night stand..."but"She'd make a great wife." Now that is a motto to live by! This is what i strive to live after God's plan will never lead you astray!

      Today i got up at 5:15! yes that early you might wonder why? or prolly not but ya neway i got up that early so that i could be at my cousin's house to babysit her two kids Heather and Blake. I am babysitting them during the weeks that they orginally would be at their dads house but he didnt want them because he is remarried so anyway....I arrived around 6:30 and watched t.v. till they got up i wasnt expecting them till like 9 or 10 but surprise suprise they got up at almost 8. By 10:30 they were bored and ready for lunch so we popped a pizza in the oven and sat down and played playdough! i forgot how much fun that stuff was with the McDonalds set until it got under my nails and i was left with the mess when the playdough lost their interest. So lunch came and went me and Heather made friendship bracelets and then made brownies, but since we couldnt fine the right pan we made them in cupcake dishes. Blake then informed me he wouldnt eat them because he hated cupcakes and those looked like cupcakes, no persuading would change his mind, so me and Heather chowed down for the rest of the day(they were excellent). We then went out side and played gotcha and horse with the basketballs, i had forgotten how bad and uncoordinated i was at this i could stand 5 feet from the goal and miss it was sad, but they thought it was hilarious so at least all wasnt lost right?! We then went inside ate more food(they are like extreme snackers) and played sock football in the living room. Then we settled down to t.v. and a dry erase board until their mom came home at 4ish. Over all though it was lots of fun i havent been that active in a while really but i did go home and nap till 6ish and then took a run after dinner. Ben came over we had a nice talk i got some nerd ropes the most fabulous candy of course i am now going to bed because im zonked and still have to get up at 5:15 again.. so good night

      Many while in a relationship are in there looking for love, some fall in love, some give their whole heart in everyone, and yet some, some are in it for the fun, the experience, and the relationship. I find nothing wrong with any of these views or ways especially if your looking for marriage.But I on the other hand are one of the percentage that are often looked apon as the insensitive ones. i cant say they all arent but why is it that way. just because they dont give themselves (their hearts) completely during the many relations you might encounter I for one am not one to date but one person. as one of my best friends extremely wonderful mom told me you date for the experience so you can find what type of person you want to spend the rest of your life with. so do people that think like that need to change their views just because they can see the realisticness in things the fact that ya you probably will break up and ya it will hurt if you ever had any feeling. thats just life i dont dwell on it, im just ever mindful is there anything wrong with that?? I want someone to have fun with so laugh and go places with to know they are always there not a soul mate.... not now thats for the future. and you know it might seem like im afraid to get hurt, but i dont think thats it, its the fact that i would rather be the one to shoulder all the hurt if the other person could go free feeling nothing more than a mere sting. My sentiments and my emotions are the one part of my being that i actually have all figure out! i cant say much for the rest of me im a loony bin :)

      Tonight I thought since I'm already up at 12:28 I might as well share my thoughts with all you wonderful learners out there. So here goes....  I am an odd ball like the grinch in a way I am far from a conformist if you think that the sandwich is peanut butter I will think its jelly so anyway...  Now you probably all are wondering what in the world is the realism plane, well it is simple this, imagine you are in the air high above it all in a plane you can see everything that is normally covered by clouds or walls on the ground and up here its clear you can see where roads end that you thought didn't end and you can see where drifting rivers meet beautiful gullies. So now I'm quite sure you are all thinking what the crap is she saying she must be on chocolate, but alas no I will explain.  That is how life is, my dad used to tell me that if you can climb to the top of a problem your having and sit on the wall then you will see how to fix it, in other words look at it from afar. And you know that really works. So here I am I am stuck in that plane that never runs out of gas and is always on the realism highway in the sky. I'm like the procedures who is scared to let go of the door because down there things are so cluttered. Instead I choose to live up here away from the bother and hurt of the world. But I'm afraid that not everything will always roll off your back and sometimes things are still too high or too far to see even in the plane. And of course I have another wonderful analogy for that too... I have no idea these just come to me bear with me its late...... So ok if your mom goes shopping everyweek she probably buys Campbells soup in a can you can use that stuff for anything, well if for awhile you stop using it and you suddenly go all natural you forget about them and so they get jumbled up and when you go to get one to finally eat when your moms out of town and will never know you realize that everything is a mess they are in no order. So you must then take them out and look at them all later and fix them correctly.    that's how I see to fix problems except that that analogy really stinks but whatever I hope you get a good laugh out of it still...  And so now that it is nearing 1 I must bid farewell and you can have fun deciphering this mess. Tomorrow I will get down to the real juicy issues I just know your waiting to read really these things are quite nosy but whatever. Good night!

      Im really bored today ever since they cancelled the brodies thing i just have like nothing to look forward to i guess. neway i fell asleep before i went to shower and i just woke up to mom's yelling for me to bring down all the dishes up here(you cant beat that to wake up to) so as i was bringing  them down stairs i did the inevitable and i dropped one and it broke making a glorious smash all over the wood floor water and glass everywhere i then got ranted at because it was one of her good glasses(isnt that the way it always is) and two just because she just wanted to yell at me. i am no banned from using the good glasses actually that one already exsisted but now i cant use the old ones i get to use plastic only yay! i guess i cant break anything at least and im also not allowed to ever bring them upstairs again.... so yea that was alot of fun i just kinda tune her out and go on. soo now i think im going to actually finally go shower and buy school supplies if i can get money by myself i dont think she would want to come anyway and then come home and be bored and stay out of mom's way and look at my lovely daisies and just do nothing.

       Saying I love you    Is not the words I want to hear from you    It's not that I want you    Not to say, but if you only knew   How easy it would be to show me how you feel.  More than words is all you have to do to make it real    Then you wouldn't have to say    That you love me    Co'z I'd already know.     What would you do If my heart was torn in two    More than words to show you feel    That your love for me is real    What would you say    If I took those words away    Then you couldn't make things new    Just by saying    I love you    More than words.     Now that I've tried to talk to you    And make you understand    All you have to do is close your eyes    And just reach out your hands and touch me    Hold me close don't ever let me go.  More than words    Is all I ever needed you to show    Then you wouldn't have to say    That you love me    Coz I'd already know.     What would you do    If my heart was torn in two    More than words to show you feel    That your love for me is real    What would you say    If I took those words away    Then you couldn't make things new    Just by saying I love you      More than words.       Isnt it true though!

      well since im bored i thought i might just write about my really weird experiences today while shopping...  ok so first i was at Target which by the way is so much better than walmart its well lit, clean, spacious, and over all wonderful.....neway like the guy was handing me my change and i promise he was like trying to hold my hand he like took forever to hand me a five and&nbsp;a ten it creeped me out. ok so then i was at the mall and i went into AE to get some jeans and like there was this guy there and he was gay or nothing just really really really helpful like he asked me all these questions and by the time i managed to sneak out and leave&nbsp;we could have been married i mean he knew like everything my size the lenght the style the kind my name etc etc..yeah so that was kinda freaky it was like he knew i didnt want to be helped to he went out of his way to help me or maybe he was on commission i duno he didnt treat anybody else that way. so yeah and then i got in the elevator and there was just me another girl and this asian guy and while we were standing there like he had a big gash in his hand and he like bent down and licked it like a dog it was soo gross yet hilariously funny but i couldnt laugh i saved it for later! and if that wasnt bad enough as i was leaving i got to view to gay guys walking in the parking lot.. so yea that was my fun shopping experience!

      ugh shopping is just so stinkin hard! it just doesnt excite&nbsp;me any more.... its like you go in find something you like and its too low or too tight or too short! what is the worlds facination with trying to appear like your wearing nothing! Do you really want the whole world to see everything? all the clothes are soooo sleazy! i mean you watch movies that are set in the past they dont dress like that they look beautiful in their nice long skirts and tops that dont have cleavage hangin out! our society is so trashy now adays. everybody is grundgee and skanky. i dont get it and what really gets me is that half the people that wear this stuff have fat rolls hangin all over the place! i mean come on gross but then what can we expect when over half the&nbsp;US &nbsp;is overweight anyway? it just really doesnt make any sense. should we not leave alittle mystery about us or by the time people are married its not gonna be anything special well as it is its getting to where its just another fun activity anyway... and its even funnier that these people go to a church and call themselves christians and say they know what the bible says and what god wants for their life ! HA HA ha ha

       While working with the adorably cute yet satanic three year olds at vbs i realized how when you get older everything gets more complicated. its weird like when does it happen? i mean you go from being 3 and 4 to suddenly being a walking teen angst defintion(finally learned what that meant thanks kris for the dictionary work). So when do things become so complicated when do our minds change over i guess puberty(eeww i really hate that word it just sounds so gross) neway... i just liked sitting there watching them they got such joy out of the little things in life like coloring and getting candy and while i baby sat kenzie i watched her giggle&nbsp; in delight over squeezing a sponge full of water out and then filling it up again and running around the yard. I guess in a way it comes down to the fact that we become very unappreciative and ungrateful little wretches. Suddenly everything must evolve around us and if something goes wrong we ask why has god cursed us?&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything becomes the parents fault and Gods why because we are too big headed to realize that stuff is our fault and that if maybe you went back to church or just opened the bible that thing you used to laugh while you patted it in bible class maybe then we would realize that everything happens for a reason and that things have consequences and that its not all about just doing what we want but what god wants! Its really a good thing god doesnt get teen angsty cause we would probably all be dead because of the amount of people that just push aside his word his knowledge his path the guidance and light of our life... its so simple yet so hard to grasp....   I dont understand why people always have to go somewhere to have fun. Its so nice just to be able to sit in a hammock in your own back yard under gods trees and just think and swing. and to just smell a flower and to run and climb a tree for some reason those things become to very "immature" but why there really isnt nothing wrong with it. We tend to forget the simple pleasures of life ... its weird that just watching three year olds for 4 nights could show you all this....

This has got to be the first time ive been sad that its ended but this year just wasnt what vbs has been in the past.......... like the bubble ahh the bubble the most ingenious vbs invention ever i still remember being so fascinated with the bubble. But now things hav e change we are all about keeping up with the pentacostal people as todd says and we cant just do bible skits anymore noooo gotta have goofy characters. but anyway it is kinda fun.........and the kids are adorable we only had five again tonight but it was fun we sang lots of songs and did the hokey pokey and sang where oh where is sweet little so and so a wonderfully time consuming song! The snacks were good tonight though we went and go lots of extras too... oh well.&nbsp; it was sad though we tore down our beautiful room it looks so bear now.........and the crazy frog lady is gonna put all her suffocating frogs back up again...ugh. i did feel bad though because i didnt finish Larry David's shoes because i took a nap and forgot to go and buy more balloons.        Its sad all the mission trip people are leaving on saturday for over a week&nbsp; its going to be very quiet at church except that i wont be there because of band camp and going to homecoming at Hawk Pride!&nbsp; i wish i could go though it would be soooooo much fun! but at least i will still have claire so its all good... i think we might go see the notebook tomorrow night it looks like one of those romantic type movies i duno maybe a chick flick oh well something to laugh about! yay.    But i have figured something out i think the reason we have so many problems today with people saying I love you just anytime they feel like it is its not really our fault its the stupid english languages fault! because we only have one word for love and it has to mean all the different kinds of love! and there is many......so it usually gets you in trouble when you say it cause then people say you dont mean it even if you do just not in a romantic way ya know i mean goodness why couldnt the english have been smart like the greeks and had four words for it! we should just start using them it would make things easier that way you could tell everybody you loved them in just the right ways and nobody would get hurt or offended or put off....

      Wooohoo! Last night was so incredibly fun! It started off with boring, uninformative VBS meetings(just keep saying fun fun fun) neway then the some of the mcocyg went to TACO SMELL! which was a blast we filled up half there eating spots there must have been like 20 or so of us! But the lady had a headache so we pretty much got kicked out for "being loud" and the sad thing was was that some of the elderly people from church were there too oh well maybe they didnt recogonize us(ha). but it was ok cause ya know we just took it as a thrill plus the baptists had just let out so they were coming in so we left so they could have some more seats. We then needed somewhere to go having like alittle over an hour till KING ARTHUR started at 10 soo we went to Rainbow Elementary's play ground cause we all love to swing(yeah we are very weird) neway just as we were starting to have fun these lights came on and it looked like from like a small go cart or something so we were like uhoh the police! and then they blew their air horn so we went back to our cars i duno why cause that just made us look guilty and plus they could block our exit out anyway... but we did and it ended up being some other people from church who thought it would be extremely funny to scare us. since we were already in our cars we followed J-Love to the mall and made a car train all through the parking lot (listening to 70's music haha) until we decided we could get in trouble so we left and went to Carmike for the movie. and lemme tell ya that was a good movie! all the guys were on the edges of their seats watching Kiera Knightley wearing almost nothing and painted blue. But ya it really was good everyone should see it! After that we just kinda went home cause goodness it was 12ish which is why im writing this now and not last night!Overall it was one of the best spontaneous outings we've done in a really long while!

      Oh My Goodness! Ocoee was the most fabulous thing ever!! it was even better than last year like we had comfy beds and lots of sleep i slept till 10(ohhh ya). on friday as soon as we got there we changed and went White Water Rafting!! i was sooooo excited. we put on all that yucky gear that smells really gross LB said it was saturated in pee water. they then informed us that no matter what percautions we took we could still get hurt. which was so comforting lol. by this time LB was kinda freaked. neway we got on the buses to drive to the put in spot. and thats when we first layed eyes on sparky!ahh he was gorgeous but i wont bore you with the details. we were being so goofy bout it but anyway he ended up being our guide!! we where estatic if i might add. he was really nice and crazy cool too! me and ashley sat in the front. we were "hardcore" neway we took off down them rapids it was a blast we got out and swam and we "baptised" LB in the ocoee for fun. i also got the ever fun part of falling out of the boat on a rapid me and ashley did i actually ended up pushing her up under the raft unintentionally though! lol it was great.Rafting wa soooooo much fun! we ate mexican that night omy that was torcherous! we were so hungry having no eaten since 10:30 this was about 7 ish we pigged out  soooooooo bad i had fried ice cream for the fist time too! but on the way home we all ended up having to pee so freakin bad on the way home it was hilarious. newayz we got home and played some poker with candy! it was crazy fun! then me and chicken wing(sara) played western and tried to make eating oreos seductive! i then collapsed into my way comfy bed. we were so lazy saturday we didnt even get dressed we just plopped on the couch in the main room and watched everybody else eat while me and LB and Ash sat there on the couch which is where we sat listening to music and playing poker till we left for the water park at 2! we ended up sharing the water park with the evangel temple group and some pentacostal baptists as well. but it was all good and tons of fun me and sara played mermaids and dolphins and me and LB tried to jump through waves. overall it was fabulous. i then went back and curled up on the couch for 5 more hours playing catch phrase. we must be hard core! actually im just lazy but i had some very enlightening discussions bout weird weird stuff.. we then did fire works ate ice cream and just did more crazy stuff! This weekend was soooooo much fun i miss it already

      Back in the old days people use to see sunday as a holy day and businesses were closed sure it still is but its not the same. they used to walk to church because hitching up the horses was "work". They would then walk home eat left overs or things cooked the night before and study the bible in silence and reflect on their lives or visit friends, neighbors or family. Now we rush to make it on time sit through class and service all the while wondering how fast we can get out of the parking lot to beat the "baptists" to our favorite lunch spot. Even while you eat your constantly thinking of what the day holds who has to be where, when and how long instead of just slowing down and enjoying your familys company. Sunday was once a day to relax and reflect to rest up for the next week to prepare yourself spiritually, mentally,and physically. Thats 52 days a year that they had to rest and relax. Sundays for some is just another day to get caught up on work or other activities not god or self reflection. We no longer have "time" for that in our fast pace world of self indulgence and greed. No wonder everone today is stressed constantly we have lost 52 days of rest and renewal! thats like 520 days in ten years days that are wasted when they should be used for god... maybe its time for us all to reflect and reverse

Peter Pan: " to die would be a great adventure" Maggie: "he is just a mean old man who needs a mommy very badly" Wendy:"give me a squench"(what in the world is a squench?)  *you know that place between sleeping and awake where you still remember dreaming.....well that is where i will always love you*

      i was just watching the health channel and its one of those shows where they deliver peoples babies. why in the world do people say that those things are beautiful! they are ugly blue, squished wrinkly ugly blobs of skin! yet for some reason they rant and rave aww look he is soooo cute i mean is it just me or are they missing the fact that they are slimy little babies with a little bit of hair....i just dont get it. there just isnt anything cute about them. sure they are small but come on. id rather wait and look at them when they are like i duno a month old when they actually look like humans with eyes and hair and actually a normal color no blue.......... if i was a doctor i couldnt say aww thats just the prettiest baby ive ever seen cause one id be lying and two none of them are pretty they all look the same.

      Well today felt just wonderful! I love this kind of weather not to hot and not to cold it just makes you feel so fresh! I had a wonderful surprise history test and then fell asleep during spanish 2. umm in anatomy we had to draw cells! Mrs.Whitworth: "Now we are going to do something fun!" Class: "Movie?" Mrs. Whitworth: " yes" Class: "Can we have popcorn" Mrs. Whitworth: "OH yeah! lets save that for the puberty video its the best!" But yea that was fun! practice felt really good i said something that sounded really dirty but i didnt mean it and im not gonna explain it! so too bad.  What i learned today:  1.the proper word for a fart is "air biscuit" 2.it is impossible for me to take tests with out gum in my mouth 3.dont ever repeat things when people tell you too

       Frank:  "Make me something to eat"  Marie:  "Make it yourself"  Frank:  "If i could make it myself than you would be out on the curb."   Marie:  "Your such a problem!"  Frank:  "You know what my problem is....I have a lifetime subscription to you!"   Frank:  "You think your telling us something we didnt know?!" "Marie knows she is a pain in the butt!"  Marie:  "And Frank knows he is a pig with shoes on!"   Ok things to do if you had a bad day:   1. go to target and buy yourself some  flowers . 2. go to atlanta bread  company and buy a  chocolate chip muffin top (cause chocolate makes you happy)    3.   come home and watch  Everybody Loves Raymond  4. Find the  song  that makes you smile and listen to it on repeat 5.  Talk  to your favorite people 6. If all else fails go  lay in the road  around 7:30-8:00ish and just  look at the sky  and talk to somebody

      Today was boring so i wont bore you but i will tell you what coach styles so thoughtfully instilled once more again today in our brains....  1. never believe anything a guy tells you until he slips that ring on your finger 2. You can make your g/f cry to make sure they still care 3. (this is not coach styles) you can make a girl very mad be telling her she cant use the bathroom and instead has to stand still.

      Monday monday..... coach Styles sang that to us this morning. well today was monday...yase... not too bad though actually... i mean anything is better than my crazy night with joel playing the pink panther song  till 11 and then keeping on waking up at random intervals thinking i was still watching a movie at Todd's. I then woke up in a ocd cleaning mood and so this afternoon i cleaned really good but that was because it is part of the get on moms good side  so i can do stuff this weekend without grief plan. School was just kinda school i zoned out a good deal, conjegated some verbos en espanol and finished my anatomy homework in band and almost killed patrick and robby...all in a days work really....i feel like im having to raise two 3 year olds who have never been spanked in their lives...  This afternoon went very fast actually and I cleaned like an ocd madwoman and was very sociable and nice to mom( very important to do since i got no sleep this weekend to show i can still be in a good mood)...im so brilliant! id better not gloat untill after it works ok so on with it. i had me some chicken salad  just makes me happy but then i watched Everybody Loves Raymond! that show makes me laugh i love Marie and Frank they freakishly remind me of myself....so mean and yet they still love each other crazy.... ok so i lost my thoughts...i guess ill end now! today was a good day  oh ok so first of all things i have learned today: 1. it takes 3 shots to kill a possum 2. There are mountain Lions in Alabama 3. I am a funny child 4. I am actually a useful girlfriend  ok so i dont know why i did that but it was kinda neat so now the thing that made me laugh the most:  Frank: "Cant you ever just shut your mouth?" Marie: "Why I have a mind of my own...i contribute.....I'm not like one of those...Trophy Wives!" Frank: "Trophy Wife?!" "What contest in hell did I win?!"  Have a good night kids!

      It’s amazing how you can speak right to my heart Without saying a word you can light up the dark Try as I may I could never explain What I hear when you don’t say a thing  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There’s a truth in your eyes sayin’ you’ll never leave me The touch of your hand says you’ll catch me if ever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all  All day long I can hear people talking out loud But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd Old mr. webster could never define What’s being said between your heart and mine  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There’s a truth in your eyes sayin’ you’ll never leave me The touch of your hand says you’ll catch me if ever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There’s a truth in your eyes sayin’ you’ll never leave me The touch of your hand says you’ll catch me if ever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all  well i was gonna put this other song on but bailey stole it from me sooo yea.

      Ok so your probably wondering what that has to do with anything but ill explain maybe youll get and maybe you wont but dont cry to me! ok so today was sunday and it was suppose to be a good day ya know church and then the end of summer cookout... so thats kinda like sweet like claires trifle which she made for the cook out! my cake that i made kinda looked like the custard on top after it had been outside and started to lump but i guess people said it tasted good so yea they were probably just saying that....ok so like church was good we got there kinda late and i got the i know you know the answer stare all through class from Dr. David but yeaa it was ok.. then i didnt save david or todd a seat well me and julie didnt and so of course i never heard the end to that one! that part doesnt really have anything to do with the trifle. ok so then at the brodies if was sooooooooo hot we like "glistened" as mrs. brodie said cause girls dont sweat(yeah whatever) and that was kinda like the watery sticky part of the trifle....ok so then everything was good i stayed clean which if you know me is hard for me cause im like a huge clutz anyway as we were leaving some slob got chocolate cake on the outside of my container so when i held it got on my shirt on yeah neway ok so that wasnt good this was the beginning of the gloopy moist cake part of the trifle right ok. so at sonic nadia and jen thought theyd get in my car to i duno why neway they must have totally missed the HUGE TRIFLE bowl cause they just plowed on in and KNOCKED it over. jen was very apolegetic and she wasnt even the one who really knocked it over NADIA did!! neway all i got from her was a laugh and a im sure it will come out while claire scooped the mess up with her hands! so at church we cleaned it out best we could and then went in to church smelling like strawberries and "glistening". which is gross if youve ever done it. its really a great experience HA... so yeah never got an apology nope not one from her no is your car gonna be ok or anything! how RUDE!!!  oh yeah something else while at sonic bailey ordered me and claire some french fries and while we were "freshening up" in the sonic bathroom which is actually quite nice neway NADIA (again i know) well the girl ate our frys yes this was before the trifle disaster so yea i was like ok thats umm cool you just ate my fries that i WANTED and you laughed AGAIN about it and now we have to leave and i dont get any! so then i guess she thought she should leave a very lasting impression in my brain today so she spilt the trifle! so see today i wasnt really in the most joyous moods and this just let set my bomb right off i bout freaked one because she ATE MY FRIES two SHE LAUGHED three SHE SPILT STRAWBERRY TRIFLE IN MY CAR. yes i freaked really bad......neway so i came home and cleaned it and no kris i know i told you i might cry but i didnt cause after church  me and bailey and claire and ashley and sara and todd went to sonic and got SOME FRIES which i ate and thouroughly enjoyed mostly..so yes now i sit here and im feeling slightly but not really better! but its nice when you feel like complaining and people dont let you and just still kinda make fun of you and make you laugh it works out better that way because then you kinda forget for awhile about YOUR TRIFLED CAR and EATED FRENCH FRIES! so yeah thanks to those who do that so faithfully! ok i think im finished........bye
