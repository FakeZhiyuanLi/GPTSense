      I have realized that all of the 20 million safelists I have joined are pretty much useless.  I'm holding on to the Gold Rush account because well, I just feel like I should have only one.  Maybe that was the problem... We'll see.

      Here's the stats on my ebay sales. Information products: (3) everything else: (0) I just wish I could figure out how to sell them for more than $1.00 Well maybe when my feedback score increases... Also, I wish I could figure out what else to sell.  It just seems like I should find something besides information.  But if that's what the people want...

      I'm revamping my website.  I'm trying to make it a little more user friendly.  I'm thinking about using tables or something like that.  The idea is that I want there to be less stuff on my homepage.  The only thing I want on my homepage is maybe a few free ebooks, the article for the week, and the subscription box.

      I created this blog to serve as my business journal.  I thought it was important to keep this one separate from my writing blog.  From here on out, this is where my business updates will be.

What Makes An Entrepreneur Tick? By DeAnna Spencer   It is only natural that when you start a business, you are doing something different than most people. They will not only look at you because you stick out like a sore thumb, but human nature will cause people to naturally ridicule what you are doing.  They will tell you all types of things like: “You’re not business material.”  “You can’t make a living working for yourself.”  “You’ll fail because nobody can ever make any money that way.”  “Pish Posh” and “Phooey” are what you should say to those types of people.  Entrepreneurship is not just about having a lot of ideas or business sense.  It is also about having a lot of guts.  You have to build self-confidence in yourself.  You have to only be concerned with pleasing yourself and your Creator (God),  not mankind.  Then, when (and if) you should fail with this particular venture, you’ll just dust yourself off and start again.  It doesn’t matter if people “think” you’re nuts!  They ain’t payin’ yo’ bills.  (had to get colloquial for a minute.)   And if you have self confidence issues, you should definitely address those before you start in any business.  I used to have issues about eating alone in restaurants because I thought everyone would be looking at me wondering why I’m eating alone.  Now, I prefer to go out by myself because I only have to worry about my own schedule.  Furthermore, no one was paying any attention to the fact that I was alone, anyway.  It was all in my head.  But I digress, back to business.  When most people fail in business, they try to “play it off” by saying they are just “in a slump” and everything will be back to normal soon.  They do this because they don’t want people to say “I told you so.”   WHATEVER!! The smart thing to do would be to figure out what wasn’t working and then try something else.  Or go get a JOB (gasp) and work on your business part time.  Whatever you do DON’T QUIT!!!  I know, I know, you’re wondering, “Why should I try again if I failed once?”  Just because you failed once doesn’t mean that you are destined for failure. If you built something successful once before (but failed), you are certain to learn from those mistakes and build a stronger business.  Just keep on trying and eventually you will build a successful business.  DeAnna Spencer publishes the weekly newsletter Prospecing and Presents.

      write a poem with the following words preview mark experiences forgetful  she doesn't even watch the preview it's a waste of time to see all of those ads she'd rather write a haiku commercials should be placed on launch pads  headed straight for outer space maybe there they can make a mark and save us the disgrace of figuring out who is all bite and who is all bark  draw from experiences you've shared have you seen a preview that wasn't dreadful by a writer who lived in a shed that explains why he's so forgetful  he doesn't have a tv so he forgets about the awful marketing that makes us all want to flee and something controversial

      Well, I still don't have a "real job" yet.  That's giving me a lot of time to devote to my online business.  I signed up for a couple of affilate programs and posted the first copy of my newsletter to the crickets. (Smile)  If you'd like to subscribe to my newsletter you can visit my website at http://www.pnewsletter.bravehost.com  I also started a store.  You can check that out at http://delspintravel.vstoremarket.com.  I still have to get my writing exercises for the past few days.  I've gotten behind.  Sundays are my days to rest, so I don't go near a computer on Sunday.  That makes me have to pull double duty with my writing, but I know my brain needs that break every so often.  I'll come back when I get my writing exercise.  Peace.

      No matter where I go or what I do I find this one thing to be true  I keep seeing this vision it keeps me on a mission  I can't rest at night nor get it out of my sight  I See Poetry everywhere I go I see poetry, sometimes I wish it weren't so  When I see poetry I have to write it down And sometimes what I write makes me frown  But the poetry that I see it usually starts from within me.

      The Unemployed Lady From Nantucket  There once was a Lady from Nanucket She needed a job because she lived in a bucket  She was behind in her bills She had a car but no wheels  The only food she had were noodles Her clothes also smelled like oodles  Her husband left her alone Mumbling something about needing a home  She couldn't do her hair because she didn't have a comb Her credit sucked so she couldn't get a loan  She didn't have rhythm so she couldn't be a dancer So what would she do with the stage name of "Prancer"?  At 5'3" she's too short to model And she wasn't going to toddle  Oh what would she do? Her hair was turning blue  Now who would hire a woman whose hair was blue? I wouldn't, would you?  Just great, now she'd have to buy a wig Oh well, at least her nose wasn't too big  Maybe she can get a job driving a truck Nah, she probabbly shouldn't push her luck  It doesn't matter anymore because she's in a better place With beings more advanced than the human race  Where you don't even need a job And you can live like a slob  On the planet Bafoon You don't have to carry a tune  Or be able to dance Or have to wear pants  You just have to be nice to all And be ready to catch the king's fall  And be willing to fight those Who insist on pantyhose  Because that's the only thing that stops the phone's ring  Well she moved to Bafoon and got a life No longer is she defined as someones' wife.

      I have awakened in my favorite show Charmed.  The sisters are fighting a very powerful demon.  In order to get home, I have to find a special herb to help them defeat this demon.  In order to find the herb, I hae to go to Centennial Park in Atlanta Georgia.  This is where the herb is grown.  Because I want to get home and because i want to defeat the demon, I go to Centennial Park to find the herb.  Of course, as I'm trying to find this herb, i'm accosted by several panhandlers asking me for spare change.  Of course, I tell them no and proceed to search for this herb when all of a sudden a summer thunderstorm happens.  I race inside to find protection from the storm.  Fortunately the storm only lasted about 5 minutes.  Once the storm is over, i hurry back into the park and locate the herb and Paige teleports me back to the mansion and the oldest sister finishes the potion that will defeat the demon.  Well now we have the potion but we need to find the demon.  I remind them that my part of the task is completed.  true to their word, they used a spell to get me back home.  Since I'm home and Charmed is on.. well duh, I watch the rest of charmed.  the sisters find the demon, use the potion and pouf he's gone and the sisters are back at p3 to celebrate.

      Okay, I'm trying this blogging thing out.  Maybe I can actually stick with this and get a book out of it.  I've had this book idea brewing in my head based on my dating experiences and how i decided to stop focusing my entire existence on having a date for the weekend.  Well I'm kind of stuck about how i want to word it.  i have my outline and everything.  This is a rambling blog, just to get started.  Okay that's all for today i have to go watch my dvds on how to start an information business.

      As I feared, today wasn't very productive for me. The only thing I managed to get done was to get my email cleaned up (some) and to update my adlandpro page, which is located at  urlLink http://www.pnewsletter.com/adlandpro.html  The housewarming was fun, though. My friend's house is very nice. It's not as boxy as I was afraid it was going to be. It's in one of those new subdivisions they keep throwing up in my city. I guess they think people want to live here or something. :-) Hopefully, I'll be able to do some writing on Sunday. I'm not holding my breath. I have rehearsal tomorrow too.   Oh well, good night.  8:15 comes pretty early in the morning.

      For those of you following my business endeavors. I've got great news... I just saved a lot of money on my car insurance with Geico (just kidding).  I couldn't resist doing that.  I love those commercials.  Anyway, I made my first sale on Ebay today.  Happy dance, happy dance, happy dance.

      write a poem or short story using the following 4 words Candy Folder Shaken Wander  Now why does my mind wander? It really makes me feel bothered because I can't remember a thing. I don't remember where I put my folder I'd put a string on my finger to help me remember but then I'd forget why that was there too. I decide maybe I should quit and get some candy. I go upstairs to my room. Then I see the broom. Of course, when I saw the broom I started sweeping. Then I started sleeping. When I woke up, my dream left me shaken. Now what did I come up here for again? I forgot.

      Today I published my ezine.&nbsp; I also decided to start sending a supplemental advertising message so my readers wouldn't get bombarded with advertising in each issue.&nbsp; I also acquired a list of wholesale sources.&nbsp; When I visited the sites on that list, I felt like a kid at Christmas.&nbsp; Of course, I can't tell you my sources yet.&nbsp; Once I get my business up and running, I might promote one of the sites...&nbsp; Until then, you have to find yours the way I found mine.&nbsp; Happy hunting.&nbsp; One word, EBAY.&nbsp; I'm not kidding.&nbsp; You can find a lot of stuff on ebay.

      Well sports fans it looks as though this blogger will be one of those "adult children living at home" again.  I still haven't been able to find a full time job.  I'm going to have to drop out of school and live at home.  I know that is the most logical thing to do, but I feel like such a failure... I just needed to vent.  Hopefully there won't be too many posts like this.  I try to keep things upbeat around her.

      trouble graph camping float  She knew it was going to be a long day.  The trouble started when she was walking to the train station.  A couple of the regulars were camping out in the park.  One of the gentlemen asked her for a quarter and as usual she said no.  That shouldn't have been unusual, but I guess the heat must have gotten to the man.  He said "Stupid ho."  She turned around and said, "Excuse me?  I just know you didn't go there."  He said, "Hell yeah, I went there and what are you going to do about it?"  She said, "What makes you think I'm going to do something about it?"  "I don't have to give you anything.  Why don't you get a job?"  Just then a cop walked by.  "Ma'am are you bothering this man?" asked the cop. "No," replied the woman.  "This man is bothering me.  He just solicited me for a quarter.  I know there has got to be some kind of panhandling law."  "There is one, but because people usually don't file complaints, these people just kind of float from corner to corner." "Well you know what? I'm going to file a complaint."  "This man made me late for my final exam.  I've got to graph formulas and stuff." The officer said, "No problem ma'am.  I can take your report here."  She filled out the report and took it to her stupid professor who wouldn't even let her make up the final exam.  He said she should have given the man a quarter...

      west best nest zest I wanted to see the beach, so I decided to head west. I know Georgia has beaches too, but it was also time to leave the nest I felt like a monkey in a zoo. Besides, I heard that their beaches were the best. If I'm going to disprove that fact, I have to go see I'm going to do it with a lot of zest. The zest that you see only comes from me.

      write a poem using these words. Capture Glass Reluctant Light  Why is she reluctant to talk? Is there something wrong with her voice? Does she think she'll get turned into a celery stalk? Or does she have an unpaid invoice?  Maybe she doesn't want to turn into glass. Maybe it's just too hard to speak. Or maybe she's afraid she'll say something crass. At least if she writes, she can sound unique.  Maybe she can't capture her meaning with her mouth. Maybe she's better with her ink pen. Maybe she's afraid she'll bring on a drought. One of the prophets did it, she doesn't want to do it again.  Well at least she sees the light That's something that most people just don't do. She knows what she says won't come out right. Maybe she'll try to start anew.

      It's official.  I am a workaholic.  I have a god-awful summer cold.  Instead of laying down like a sensible person, what did I do today?  I published my ezine and I promoted.  I'm still up because I decided to add another product to my website.  I'm going to add it tommorrow, but I decided that I should upload all the files tonight.  I'm not even taking my own advice.  I promise that I'm going to sleep eventually....
