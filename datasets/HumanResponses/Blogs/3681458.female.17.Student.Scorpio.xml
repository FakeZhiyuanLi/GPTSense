      My ex-boyfriend, Matt(that's an alias), tells me today that he is leaving for Georgia tomorrow morning.  He ignores all my calls and acts mad at me, even though he is the one who waited until today to tell me.  I don't know how I expected him to tell me.  Whatever hope we had of getting back together has now gone up in smoke.  At least I feel that way.  He even mentions that we should go back to the way we were when he knows what's coming.  Right now, even though I am in love, I hate him.  I want to sneak out tonight.  My sister's window has no screen.  I can leave and come back in the morning.  I could act like I am just tired from my stay at a friend's house this week.  I want to spend every second with him until he leaves.  I know this isn't possible though.  My parents are psychotic.

      Well, I have a short amount of time to write this... Yesterday, while I was working there was this group of guys.  There were maybe about 8 or 9 of them and they were watching me in the window.  One of them came in, got a carmel apple.  And as I was handing it to him, he says, "Damn you look good." I just smiled and rang him up.  Then he was like, "do you have a b/f?" no, but I'm probably too young for you.  "How old are you?" 17.  Are you in school? "No, how bout I take you out to dinner tomorrow night?"   Note to Guys Pursuing Me: There is nothing wrong with telling a girl you think she looks good, and there's nothing wrong with asking her on a date.  But you've only had a 2 minute conversation with me, tops.  How do you know I'm your type.  And also, I'm not the type of girl who would go out w/someone who's name I don't have just to have "fun".  Good lord, step up and act like a man.  Ask me for my number, get to know me.  Then we shall see.

      I feel so completely betrayed.  I was talking to Matt's friend, Quinton the other night, and he told me so many things about Matt that I really had a hard time believing they were true.  I had a couple of days to think about it, and I finally talked to Matt last night about it.  by that time, it had all built up and I pretty much figured everything Quinton had told me was true.  Turns out, I shouldn't believe Quinton because he tells Matt the same things about me.    At one point and time both of them liked me, and basically I had to make a decision between the two (which wasn't hard to do).  But in the meantime of me making that decision, I basically tore that friendship apart.  We all still talk, but it's not like we hang out like we used too.  I can't figure why Quinton would want to lie to us like this.  He told me a long time ago that he was over me, but is that really true?  I don't want to jump to conclusions, it's not like I will be talking to him for a long time anywho.  I just can't figure why so many people want to tear us apart.   I have now made the decision, and regardless of a promising opportunity to date someone else... I am sticking with Matt.  I am glad we are getting back together.    Did I mention I got a new job?  I am working at the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory in our town's mall.  Wahoo!  Nothing like being surrounded by chocolate and being asked to try it because you need to know what it tastes like for the customers.  =) I work tonight, and it feels weird, b/c I'm actually excited.

      I found out today that my parents are putting our dog down.  I am done crying about it.  I am trying not to be a hostile, cold-hearted bitch (that my parents describe me as) about it, but at the same time I'm trying not to get it out of perspective.  I will miss her, but all the same I can realize it's for a good reason.  She almost bit me the other day when I came home.  I was standing in the living room talking to the rents about my new job (at the chocolate factory) and she tears across the room, leaps over my dad and lunges for my stomach.  I don't know when she's going.  Sometime in the next couple of days.  My mom's friend, Jan is coming over to pick her up.  My dad was torn up.  He is so attatched to her and it's fucking Father's Day.    It's amazing how I can plan to act one way and feel another and everything falls to pieces when I hear he is going away.  I was really trying to play it off as, 'I don't want to jump back into anything just yet, I'm not sure what I think of you, and tons of other crap.'  I know how I feel about it, and I can't bear the thought of him with someone else.  This Summer is turning to crap.  Very quickly too.  I haven't run in two days... dont know why I've all of a sudden become lazy and careless about our soccer conditioning...  And by the way.  I found a really good cd to drive around with when I am angry.  The new Avril Lavigne cd, which I don't traditionally listen to this type of music.  More along the lines of Modest Mouse or RHCP, but... I must say her vocals have tremendously improved since her last album (which gave me a headache).  But my sister and I like to compare her to Alanis Morissette now.  =)  I strongly reccommend it to all the angry and discouraged girls out there, who would like to rant and rave about their boy problesms. =P  Although her lyrics still need help, I can honestly to relate to them.  This is all for now I have things to do!

      I got home yesterday from the waterpark, and my parents called me in their room.  They told me that my friend, Jared had died in a carwreck that morning.  They told me how he died, but I can't remember much.  I am so emotionally spent that I could sleep for three days.  He was an incredible person.  I will never forget him, or these next few days.

      Wackiness: 40/100 Rationality: 46/100 Constructiveness: 38/100 Leadership: 60/100    You are an SEDL--Sober Emotional Destructive Leader. This makes you a dictator. You prefer to control situations, and lack of control makes you physically sick. You feel have responsibility for everyone's welfare, and that you will be blamed when things go wrong. Things do go wrong, and you take it harder than you should.  You rely on the validation and support of others, but you have a secret distrust for people and distaste for their habits and weaknesses that make you keep your distance from them. This makes you very difficult to be with romantically. Still, a level-headed peacemaker can keep you balanced.  Despite your fierce temper and general hot-bloodedness, you have a soft spot for animals and a surprising passion for the arts. Sometimes you would almost rather live by your wits in the wilderness somewhere, if you could bring your books and your sketchbook.  You also have a strange, undeniable sexiness to you. You may go insane.

      My Dad walked into my room today and handed me a piece of paper.  I was expecting it to be the usual junk, about a hurricane or some natural disaster or something that is completely unimportant to me, but something I should read just to humor him.  On this piece of paper is a picture of a girl.  "Do you know her, she goes to your school," my dad tells me.  "No, she must be a freshman," I say.  "She died in a carwreck."  On this piece of paper is the sad account of this girl and her boyfriend who were driving home on Monday night.   He was speeding, and the car drifted into the Southbound lane as they went around the curve.  He over corrected and they spun off the side of the road.  The car struck a driveway, became airborne bounced and landed twice more and finally struck a utility pole while upside down and still in the air.  His girlfriend was dead when the cops arrived.  He, however had no life-threatening injuries and is in stable condition. BASTARD!  Uggh.  Why is it necessary to drink, and drive your girlfriend home?!?  This has been drilled in our heads since we have been in school!  I am not saying that he's a bastard for drinking underage, but for being completely irresponsible with someone's life in his hands.  Charges, such as vehicular homicide and underaged drinking are being placed against him.  He deserves everything that's coming to him.  This is one of the many carwrecks that have occured involving people at my schol, and it sickens me to think that nobody has learned thier lesson yet.

         I was just cleaning out my junk drawer this morning, and I came across a letter that I had written my ex boyfriend.  I, being the loser that I am wanting to hold on to this for future reference, made a copy of it, and threw it in my junk drawer.  His name was David and he was my dream guy.  He was 6'3, jet black hair and an olive complexion, and he had deep chocolate eyes.  His Mom was Haiwaiian, so he was gorgeous.  He was in a band, and played electric guitar.  He was musically talented and wrote songs for me.  He played guitar, drums, piano, mandolin and so many other instruments.  I don't think I ever got to the point of possibly falling in love with him.  I broke up with him, b/c I was afraid of "getting hurt".  I walked away from that relationship without crying a tear.  We were together for nearly six months, and it was my first serious relationship.  David now weighs nearly fifty pounds heavier, he never leaves his house, and doesn't talk to anyone anymore.  I broke his heart.     I look back and realize how many guys hearts I have broken.  The list is long and I'm only seventeen.  I have grown bitter against guys, and I'm not afraid to shoot them down.  I have decided I'm going to try to be nicer.    The reason I say all of this, is I'm letting my self be madly in love with Matt.  I don't to walk away from him and not feel a thing.  If my heart is broken, so be it.  This is what I want.  I want to feel love and pain in this relationship.

      There's this girl I work with who's name is Felisha.  She's 19 and has been working at the chocolate factory for two years.  It's not exactly like she gives you a great impression when you first meet her.  Her face is usually caked in so much make up that her face looks orange, and she always smells like cigarette smoke when she walks past you.  Well, today Felisha was obviously p.m.sing, and told me so... like I needed that cleared up.  It's not like this is really a big huge deal, but when I'm cutting almost eighty pounds of fudge and you're complaining for the three hours that you're around me about how much you hate this job.  Then I just want to scream!  I realize people pms, but why is it that some girls make you take the brunt of it?  Especially when they realize how they're acting. One of these days, I'm just gonna go buy some Midol at WalMart and hand them a  FEW  of them.  Maybe six, then they can pass out and I don't have to hear them.

      Nothing works out the way I plan.  Some friends of my parents are paying me to paint their deck.  It's 300 bucks.  But... in the meantime I have gotten a new job and gone on vacation.  Plus the weather hasn't been all that nice lately.  Their deck is friggin huge.  I am getting to the point that I just want to get this half finished.  I am usually not a quitter, but since they are pushing me so much, and my life has suddenly gotten alot busier I just want to finish this half, and let them get a taste of what it's like.  It is not worth it.  I can work in the air conditioning, and not have to worry about bugs, getting paint on myself, doing three coats, getting to their house (not that big of a prob since I drive, but it's not like they're neighbors or in this part of town) or taking care of their three dogs.  I averaged it out, and I'm getting paid around six bucks an hour... NOT WORTH IT!!    Last night, Quinton asked me to go out to lunch with him today.  He doesn't know that Matt and I are back together and nor do I want to tell him.  Does he want to go out as a date?  I certainly don't want to.  If so, that's the third person in a week.  I need to wear a sign that says I'm not interested.  I am going to try to post more, and I will try to  keep it interesting. =P

      Tonight was my first night as keyholder at work.  My manager likes me so much that I got a key!!! So tonight, I am done with everything... and feeling great because I am on top of it, and the store looks wonderful.  I am closing alone and my manager has given me the access code and password for the alarm.  I get the store closed, set the alarm... walk outside and I can't get my key out of the friggin lock.  I know this is lame, I know how to get a key out of a door.  I think I was just nervous.  I walk back inside and the alarm is beeping really obnoxiously loud at me.  I punch my code in.  It doesn't work!  I punch it again.  It still doesn't work.  I do this like ten times in a row, before the alarm makes this horrible sirening sound that made my ears ring afterwards.  I decide that I am going to remain calm, but I can't.  I begin to cry.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know where anything is. The phone rings, and it's the alarm people.  I explain to them that it's my first night to close and the code my manager gave me wasn't working.  Nothing is working. Not even the "special code that I'm not supposed to have" that the nice guy gave me.  I accidentally call the owner of the store, before finding my manager's number in the pile of papers on the desk.  He says, "hang on, I'll be up there in a minute".  It didn't take him five.  His code works, but mine still doesn't.  I have to get a new one.  Bah.  Thank you Jason!  You're my hero!

          Binging must be a sure sign of the stress I have gone through recently.  I need to knock it off.  I am going to drag my sister with me tomorrow to the park so we can go for a run.  Then, she is coming back and doing pilates with me.  (this is of course if she wants to, but I'm not sure if I will give her too much of a choice.)     I cried myself to sleep last night.  I feel so unhappy.  I really need to go back to the shrink.  I need to do so many things, but I lack the energy to motivate myself.  I told Ben that if I loved him, I would go back.  I haven't made an appointment.  Does that say anything?  I felt like he was blackmailing me to go, therefore I wanted to rebel and not go.  I know it's for my own good though.  I just felt so overwhelmed with emotions yesterday.  I pretty much didn't cry at the funeral.  The only time I really cried was with Spencer.  The rest of the time I spent supporting everyone else.       Lately, everyone has sad that I need to smile more.  Like, the other day... there was this group of guys at work.  It was right after I found out about Jared.  They asked me what was wrong, (after asking me to get drunk with them) and said I needed to smile more.  It's not like a group of nine guys is going to be able to sympathize, so I just blew them off.  I hate to be glum and grim... I really am trying, it's just so fucking hard.  I don't understand life or the point of it sometimes.  It sucks so fucking much.  Why do my friends have to die?  Why do my parents have to be asses? Why has my life been the way it's been?   Who fucking knows.  Life sucks, and I miss Jared.

      This morning, I woke up sort of in a daze.  My parents wanted to go to the funeral, just to be emotionally supportive to my sister and I.  So, after being really upset about finding something to wear... although, I know that's not what I was truly upset about, I finally settle on something, we begin the somber ride to Hermitage.   We arrive at the funeral home.  There aren't too many people when we get there.  Most of our friends are already there and they all wave and give us hugs.  I just want to break down, but I know I must be strong for those who hurt more than I do.  Sad music is playing over the speakers, and you can hear Jared's mom sobbing on someone's shoulder.  There is a line through the pews that ends in a semi circle where there's Jared's urn, a slide show, and photo boards of him.  Everyone offers his mom their condolances, and finds a place to sit after looking at the pictures. Kelly shows up with Catherine, and she is already a mess.  My sister walks around with her, and gives her the support she needs, while I talk to Alex who is obviously hurting.  He isolates himself from everyone else, even when he could cry on someone's shoulder and nobody would think he was less of a man for it.  There are so many people there.  Boy Scouts, Friends, Teachers, Family, people he probably didn't know he had an impact on.  There were too many people to fit in the room.  Some had to stay outside, and jsut listen to the service.  I am glad we got there early.   The Reverand gets up, and talks about what a great person Jared was, and how he still lives with us...  Frank gives a eulogy.  It was so sad, because we all remember our last moments with him and never would have thought that it would be the last time.  Frank's eulogy is wonderful, and then they play a song by Yellowcard.  That's Jared's favorite band.  It was about saying goodbye.  Everyone is crying.   The funeral is over, and everyone groups outside, where I hug Spencer and just fall apart and cry on his shoulder. Drew is there from Florida.  Even though he had classes, he skipped them to be with us.  Quintin is crying in Emi and Kelly's arms.  I have never seen him cry until now.  Frank's face is all red and his eyes are bloodshot.  Jared was his bestfriend.  Sheena looks like she's about to lose it, and I walk over and give her a hug.  Everyone cries in someone's arms. We all came together today, in such a horrible time. Today I realize that life is too short to hold so many grudges.  I don't want to die with my life like this.  I am sorry Ben.  I am going to get my life in order so if I die tomorrow, I can leave an impact like Jared did.   God Rest his Soul.

      1.) Your five o'clock shadow 2.) My stupid paintings and notes and pictures that you gave me 3.) Your stupid cologne 4.) When you held my hand in the car, but had to switch gears every five minutes 5.) The way you say I love you like 50 times in a row, b/c you know it makes me have butterflies 6.) Your unpredictableness 7.) Your hot temper that is completely sexy. 8.) The way you always close your eyes when you kiss me. 9.) The warmth and comfort of your embrace. 10.) The way you wipe my eyes of their tears.

      Seems the shit hits the fan when the rain falls.  I just got enlightened about my crappy ass (ex) boyfriend.    You knew that my friend had died in a carwreck.  You never called my house, because you were a pussy about my parents.  They have never been unkind to you, and you're too chickenshit to call my fucking house (b/c my cell phone is temporarily taken away from me...).  You won't even step up and call me when I am extremely depressed about losing Jared.  You won't show up and see me at work, b/c you fell asleep.  You laugh it off like it's funny when it actually hurts me, but that's because you're an asshole and it's time for this to stop.  You won't do anything, b/c you are "busy"  I was indisposable to you.  Everything was according to how it worked out for you.  And then I call you tonight, and you're like ughh, everyone is out with their significant other and I'm driving all alone...  I am not feeling any fucking sympathy since you could have spent almost all night with me last night.   I feel like a bitch, but I have a fucking point.  I am mad, and I'm stronger than you'll imagine.  You won't be getting a fucking phone call for weeks.  You can forget it.  Until you can step up and act like a man, you can shove me having a part in your life right up your fucking ass.  I don't want anything to do with you.  You disgust me.

      It would seem that some people cannot fight thier own battles.&nbsp; The drama with Ben goes on, and all I can do is apologize for his immature friends.&nbsp; My manager and coworkers laughed their asses off at Jennifer today.&nbsp; Apparently she thinks I'm not over Ben.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her IQ must be low.&nbsp; She can't be any more wrong.&nbsp; lol, I can't explain how over him I am.&nbsp; I hate him.&nbsp; He's ugly, queer, and incapable of acting his age.&nbsp; When I'm 18, my mommy won't be fighting my battles for me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Today, I went out to eat with my grandmother at Olive Garden, and then we went to Victoria's Secret.&nbsp; It was fun, we found all kinds of cool stuff.&nbsp; Then, we went to Kohls.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found some stuff I wanted there.&nbsp; It was fun to hang out with her, and just keep her updated on everything that's going on.&nbsp; We talked about Ben, College, Jason... and the list goes on. =) &nbsp; Alex from Nashville is here today.&nbsp; My sister went and picked him up.&nbsp; He's like 19, so he feels like an older brother.&nbsp; I like him.&nbsp; He's silly, but can always keep the mood light. &nbsp; Jason wanted me to come over to his house tonight.&nbsp; He was going to cook me a spaghetti dinner.&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp; I never said if I would or wouldn't go.&nbsp; It feels too soon.&nbsp; He's a hopeless romantic, and I love it.&nbsp; Someone needs to sweep me off my feet for my attention.&nbsp; But, I didn't go... because it felt too soon, and I got invited to go have pizza with friends.&nbsp; So, I opted for the latter since I don't want to rush anything.&nbsp;  &nbsp; But this is all.&nbsp; I must go.

      All three of us are sitting in the front row facing the judge.&nbsp; Dad is called up to the podium and is asked if he wants to plead guilty or not guilty.&nbsp; We chose not guilty, so we wouldn't have to pay any fines.&nbsp; We have a court date on August 26th, the judge says.&nbsp; The cop will be there along with Quintin who got called into work.&nbsp; We weren't allowed to give a testimony or anything.&nbsp; ( For some reason, I think the judge should decide if you're guilty or notguilty through your testimony.) &nbsp;  So, last night I had court and then my sister and I went to Amanda's house on the way home.&nbsp; Her mom is from New York, and her Dad is from Italy.&nbsp; They have awesome accents.&nbsp; But her mom likes to cook, so she made us home-made spaghetti.&nbsp; It was the most I've eaten in the past couple of days.&nbsp;  We stopped at blockbuster with Amanda on the way back to our house, and met Alex up there.&nbsp; We rented  Girl with a Pearl Earing  and  Wuthering Heights. &nbsp; We watched  Girl with a Pearl Earing  first and it was good, but I was the only one who read the book, so I don't think it held a candle to the book.&nbsp; They left out alot in the movie.&nbsp; We started  Wuthering Heights ,   but the acting was so terrible, that we stopped it.&nbsp; For some reason, when my sister and I rent movies we are attracted to the independent films.&nbsp; This is good and bad.&nbsp; Bad, because you can get the movies with absolutely no plot, and horrible acting.&nbsp; Good, because you can run accross one that is really intriguing.&nbsp;  Jason called me last night, and I got to talk to him until 12:45.&nbsp; For some reason, I didn't think he'd actually call me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe that's because of Ben's sorry standards.&nbsp; I really stooped down for Ben.&nbsp; Amanda is in a serious relationship and her boyfriend treats her like a queen.&nbsp; I want someone like that.&nbsp; Someone who will show they care by simple things.&nbsp; Like leaving a rose on my car for me or something.&nbsp; I want someone desparately romantic.&nbsp; I'm jealous of Amanda =).&nbsp;  So, back to Jason.&nbsp; We talked about alot of stuff.&nbsp; Don't know if I like him or not.&nbsp; I'm trying just to see where everything goes.&nbsp; Right now, I just want a friend to talk to... (I call him my rebound friend) heh. It just seems that the age gap is so huge.&nbsp; I feel like his little sister when I talk to him.&nbsp;  This is all for now.&nbsp; Amanda is making pancakes, and I've got to get ready for work.

      Yesterday, Jason insisted on walking me to my car.  He thought maybe somebody would jump me or something. (they have proven themselves to be that dumb) By the time he is done closing his store, and I'm done closing mine, and the storm is over, there is not a car in the parking lot except both of ours. We laugh, we hug, and he's like let me know if anything happens I will get my fraternity brothers together, and we'll kick his ass.  Jason is uber nice.  I talked to him today again, and told him everything that had happened.  He asked how I was, and I told him that it has made me physically sick.  And I was embarassed for myself and for him.  I can't eat.  I don't want to eat. I cried myself to sleep last night.  He, like me, is all but prejudice against homos.  I can't help it.  It is so disgusting and repulsive.  I only have like two friends who are, and I get the heebie jeebies from Zac.  I wonder so many things.  So many questions will always be unanswered. I wonder if he really truly cared for me.  Did he ever imagine I was a guy?  Did he cheat on me?   I doubt he would have broken up with me, and I imagine he was going to cheat on me with guys.  Was he ever going to tell me, and if he was, did he think that I would be cool with two guys in the bedroom?  Gah. I don't know what to think.  I want to yell at him.  I want to hurt him.  I want to file charges. (but he may be happy because he'll be getting butt sex. =P)  I want him to be miserable, unhappy.  He is a festering sore on everyone's back.

      It's weird how being emotionally sick to your stomach can make you phsysically sick.  I can't believe no one in my family knew or said anything.  Especaially  me for that matter.  I am sick to think that I kissed him.  It is repulsive.  My stomach is in knots.  I would have liked to have thought that it was real.  It was all a lie.  I doubt he would have broken up with me before college.  Ugg.  I don't want to think about this.  I hate him, I am burning his paintings and pictures.  Anything that has to do with him, I am burning today.  Maybe I will send his mom the paintings.  Not sure.  Ack.  I don't want everyone to know.  I'm sure he doesn't either (but who really cares now...).  I am embarassed.  This will change so much.

      So, the signs that Ben and his dumbass friends posted about me said:  Missing Dog Breed: Psychotic Ex Name called : Johnna Last seen: Cleaning herself at the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.  (First I have to say, that this is entirely unoriginal.  This has to be something out of a book.  There's no way he could have thought of it, nor his friends. And, now that I look at it, I have to laugh.  I am laughing at him right now...)  My sister and Alex found this yesterday.  Emi brought it home and showed Dad, who asked me for Ben's number.  I begged him not to call him, but he called him and threatened him.  It was all my friends and I could do to blow that off rather than seeking revenge.  Like slashing tires, rolling, egging, putting chemicals in his car so it would blow up.  Man, we had some awesome plans.  But anywho back to my story. So, we thought that was all of the signs, but Bernard the security guy at the mall came into the Chocolate Factory today.  He showed my manager the sign and talked to me.  He asked who it was, and for the number.  Which I more than gladly gave him both.  They called him, and apparently scared him so much that he came up to the mall.  Bernard is nice, and it's good to know that he's on my side.  We could have kicked some major ass.  My manager was fucking pissed at Ben because the store's name was on it, and because it was about me.  So, later this afternoon Ben shows up at my house WITH HIS MOM!  I'm sorry, but this is fucking funny.  I laughed my ass off when I found out.  If only I could have seen it.  Don't know what I would have done.  I hate him.  I don't ever wnat to lay eyes on him again.  As Bernard said, if I wasn't already over him, then I am now.  That's the truth.  Hahaha.   Rhia asked how long I was with him, and so did Bernard.  Only seven months. They were both like, "dang." Can't believe he would do all this over seven months...  Dad knows all the charges we could have pressed.  Like Stalking, Slandering (the store's name) and a few others.  Can't remember all that cop stuff.  Eh, but he could be in jail right now.  I'm sure Dad would be sure and talk to the judge and his ass would be in jail for at least 5 years.  But I am not the heartless bitch he says I am, and couldn't bring myself to press charges.   Might get revenge one day, but certainly not now.    And on a side note.  Can't help but think his friends are fucking immature, dramatic idiots.  They could all run around slandering everyone even if it's none of their business, only because they don't have their own lives to worry about.  Good God, they're stupid.  Don't know why I was with him. What a waste of time.    But I have the last laugh.  Wish somebody would have photographed him saying he was sorry.  lol.

      I would be embarrassed to write about what my ex boyfriend did to me yesterday.  Embarassed because I actually dated him, and he's fucking dumb. lol.  But I am done.  I have all the support I need.  It's over, and I don't ever want to see his ugly face again. I finally met Asher last night.  He's fucking cool, and I know why Alex hangs around him all the time.  Al and I decided we're gonna hang out more.  He's the one who found the sign yesterday.  We all wanted to do so many things, but my dad took care of that.  I could have a restraining order put on Ben if I wanted.  I want to see his ass in jail man.  My dad would be more than happy to put it there.  Al and Asher had barbed wire and were going to wrap it around his tires or something... But I was like  no, he's probably already shitting in his pants b/c of the phone call he got.  I don't want us to do anything so it could screw up my dad's plans.   Quintin is awesome.  He always makes me laugh when I am down.  Emi and I both layed on his shoulders while watching the movie last night.  It was fun.  But the movie was boring.  An independent film as usual and of course Emi loved it.  It was about a midget.  I hated it, and talked to Alex the whole time.  Quintin had already seen it, so he was telling us the story.. bah. Asher was absorbed in it.  Like it took a while to interrupt his concentration on the movie. Oh, went to go see Spider Man 2 with my brother yesterday.  It was awesome.  I liked it better than the first. =)  That's all for now.

      BAH.  Ben leaves me a comment on my blog (which I gave him the link a while ago... but I write in it, regardless if he's reading it or not) and tells me a I am a whore, and that his parents refer to me as a whore.  That shows how mature his parents are.  Around here, at my house we don't call him names.  We don't make fun of him.  We all loathe and despise him.  I hate him.  He needs to choke on some guys cock.  Then maybe he can get a feel (just maybe -if that's possible at all) of how nasty it was to suck his.  Leave me the fuck alone!

      I think I am starting to like Jason.  He has asked me out like three times, but I keep turning him down.  Don't know why.  He's cute, 21 and definently man enough.  Speaking of man enough, I've had some recent doubts about Ben.  Megan and I were talking last night.  I have been asked by more than one friend if he was gay.  It never really occured to me.  But as Megan said, hindsight is 20/20.  I think it could be true. Let me list the facts: 1.) I was hardly ever kissed.  I had to be the one to make the first move. (which I fucking hate) 2.) He never let me see him cum. (I don't know if this is that big of a deal) 3.) He only had girl friends, and his guy friend is Quinton.  4.) He was very concerned with how he dressed. 5.) He was scared of my parents, and definently wasn't a man about it. He acted like a girl.  Well there's my summed up list.  I have more, but don't really want to list them all.  I also had a huge list going of all the things he did that annoyed me.  I am not even upset about it being over.  I miss the company, but not the person.  That is so sad to say, and I hate writing it.  I don't really know why I was with him.  I just ignored the things he did that bothered me.  Granted, I know that I won't meet a perfect person, but there has to be some things I like about them.  I read his journal now, and don't really know who that person is.  He has changed so much.  He swears now, and never did that before.  Almsot like he had a separate identity around me.  So sad, I could have dated so many other people too.  Who definently weren't gay, who would have treated me right, and who I am friends with now and they don't get on my nerves.  I feel like I wasted my time, but I am happy to move on, and I can't wait to see what will happen.  In the meantime, I wait it out.  I will flirt with whoever I want.  I will date casually.   That is all for now.  Going to a movie with Jared.

      Jason read my journal, and said that it was a lot deeper than he was expecting.&nbsp; I guess that's a good thing.&nbsp; I only write it for myself which results in a deeper look at myself.  Work today was okay... Krystle cracks me up.&nbsp; She's awesome.  Saw Jason tonight.&nbsp; Went and gave him a massage after work, and took him a rootbeer float, a chocolate covered strawberry, and a couple PB buckets.&nbsp; Heh. I'm nice =).&nbsp; I guess we decided that we'd be friends, but that sorta went up in smoke.&nbsp; Don't really know what's happening.&nbsp; Eh.&nbsp;  Saw Amanda&nbsp;at work.&nbsp; Gosh I love her.&nbsp; She's awesome, and I can talk to her about anything.&nbsp; I'm glad we're getting to be&nbsp;better friends.&nbsp; Especially recently.&nbsp; She's been&nbsp;coming over alot.&nbsp;  Talked to Nathan tonight.&nbsp; Seems that we can never really get a&nbsp; conversation going.&nbsp; Something usually happens.&nbsp; Blah.&nbsp; I hate that about him.&nbsp; I really want to be better friends with him.&nbsp; I can't maintain a conversation with him.  My sister is dumb.&nbsp;&nbsp; She thinks I can't figure out the mileage for the car, and whether or not she put gas in it.&nbsp; Good lord.&nbsp; What kind of an idiot does she think I am?&nbsp; I'm not.&nbsp; I've had phsyics and all the simple math I need to figure out how much gas you would need, how many gallons were in the car. etc. etc.&nbsp; I can't wait to have my own car.&nbsp; Oh gosh, I can't wait.&nbsp; She's such a slob it annoys the piss out of me.  But moving right along...&nbsp; I think I"m going to go to sleep now.&nbsp; But anywho.&nbsp; Have a good'n.

      I am sitting here listening to the Smashing Pumpkins.&nbsp;   Jason and I decided last night that if we weren't together we could at least be friends.&nbsp; I must decide soon, so I can call him after tonights practice.&nbsp; I can't help but be bitter against guys.&nbsp; I don't want to hurt anyone, but I am in pain right now.&nbsp; This completely turned my world upside down when I didn't do anything mean, and someone retaliates in such a&nbsp;cruel manner.&nbsp; Someone who said they loved me.&nbsp; You knew better!&nbsp; I've been hurt too many times by people who say they love me.&nbsp; You didn't ever love me.&nbsp; You blew smoke up my ass.&nbsp; You used me as a pawn.&nbsp; I used to care about you.&nbsp; I am over you.&nbsp; I can't be anymore over you.&nbsp; I am not over the things you've done to me.&nbsp; Fuck you Ben.&nbsp; I hate you.&nbsp; You're worthless.&nbsp; You made me feel worthless, and for that you need to go to hell.&nbsp; I can't describe how much I hate you.&nbsp; You and you're stupid friends will never learn.&nbsp;   There is someone I want, but I'm not sure if he still wants me.&nbsp; He would be perfect for me.&nbsp; He's liked me for so long, I can't imagine if he's completely moved on.&nbsp; He is my fairytale ending.&nbsp; I have never really told him how I've honestly felt.&nbsp; Megan and I were talking about it, and&nbsp;it hurts to think about it.&nbsp;   Don't want to hurt Jason.&nbsp; Don't know what to say.&nbsp; I am too confused right now.&nbsp; I am bitter.&nbsp; Not against him, but just bitter towards relationships right now.&nbsp; &nbsp;I feel like I can't trust anyone.&nbsp; He says he means all the things he's said.&nbsp; Everyone else has lied.&nbsp; Don't know why he should be any different.&nbsp; For that matter, anyone.  Will keep you updated on what I decide.&nbsp;

      I am currently surviving off a grand total of like 24 hours from the past five days.&nbsp; okay, I'm not really surviving.&nbsp;. . Went to practice this morning even though I felt like I was gonna puke as soon as Megan, and Emi jumped on my bed at 7:15 this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; We all went to practice and ran a whole shit-load.&nbsp;&nbsp;Becca, surprisingly, didn't get on my nerves at all.&nbsp; I had a great time even though I was exhausted.&nbsp; Drew brought two of his lab puppies to practice today too.&nbsp; Emi and I might buy one.&nbsp; They are AKC registered.&nbsp; Man, they're friggin cute. After that, Quinton and Ashley came over.&nbsp; Emi, Quinton and Jared went to go do communtity service at Mrs. Snowden's house. (she's a little old lady down the street)&nbsp; I took a shower and went to go see Jason, and then to work. Jay came in.&nbsp; Interesting that "Evan" is hanging out with him now.&nbsp; Back when I was hanging with Jay, Evan said he didn't like him, that he couldn't stand him.&nbsp; Blah blah blah.&nbsp; But maybe that's because Evan was a fruit and was threatened by Jay, and me watching...&nbsp; I talked to Jay and found that he was dating Katie Dempsey.&nbsp; Okay, that is a little weird.&nbsp; Double weird.&nbsp; I can't imagine Evan hanging out with him.&nbsp; (Explains everything-love how everything comes together afterwards..)&nbsp; Jay also didn't know about the stuff that Evan has done to me, so I just told him to ask him.&nbsp; I hope Evan's embarassed.&nbsp; He needs to be.&nbsp; FUCKHEAD. Jason and I were talking last night about running.&nbsp; He swore taht he would get up and run this morning, but he slept in.&nbsp; I ragged him about it at work, so he drove home and actually ran to the outlet mall.&nbsp; Lol.&nbsp; By then I had a really bad fever and wasn't up for anything.&nbsp; Jason told me he's a carrier of mono last night.&nbsp; I don't think that's what I have though.&nbsp; Just probably exhaustion.&nbsp; So, he hung out at work for two and a half hours.&nbsp; He helped me wash dishes, got me some tylenol.&nbsp; Gosh, he's so sweet.&nbsp; Then, we stayed after I was done closing... won't say what we did.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; But I lose all control with him.&nbsp; Maybe it's because he's constantly telling me I'm gorgeous.&nbsp; I like all the compliments.&nbsp; Let's just say that Ben can't even hold a candle to him.&nbsp; There's absolutely no comparison.

      Today, I went and took senior pictures with my sister.&nbsp; We took Daisy, and everyone loved her.&nbsp; Then, we went to see my mom and stopped by the Sprint store to pick up my sister's new phone.&nbsp; We came home, and I fixed my sister dinner.&nbsp; Dad was mad at her becasue she made a 2 on her A.P. test.&nbsp; Good grief.&nbsp; I got really mad, and felt guilty because I passed and will be able to get out of Freshman English in college.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; I fell asleep for three hours because alot of my time this weekend&nbsp;has been spent on the phone with Jason. &nbsp; Ah... Jason. =)&nbsp; What can I say?&nbsp; I spent a couple hours at his house tonight.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; He gave me a back massage which was nice... among the other things that were. &nbsp; Dad talked to Ben's mom.&nbsp; (I threw everything away today, and I'm not going to take his paintings to her.&nbsp; screw it.&nbsp; She might think I did something wrong by doing that.)&nbsp; So, I had to ask him what Ben had his panties in a wad about.&nbsp; Apparently he thinks I'm going to have him beat up or something.&nbsp; Lol.&nbsp; I could tell that Dad probably thought it was funny.&nbsp; He kinda just blew it off.&nbsp; I think he's sick of getting phone calls about a bunch of bullshit.&nbsp; I am as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not going to have him beat up.&nbsp; If he does get beat up, I won't have anything to do with it, and I imagine he'll deserve it.&nbsp; (not like he doesn't now.)&nbsp; I am tired of him reading this journal, and I don't know how to make it private, so fuck it.&nbsp; If he wants to read it and weep, then so be it.&nbsp; I don't care anymore.  &nbsp; But this is all for now.&nbsp; I've gotta call Jason. &nbsp;

      Jason fucked with me. Glad he got what he wanted. Some ass to make him feel better. Nothing like self-absorbed, self-gratification. Fuck. I dont want to be friends right now. I know I should forgive him, but right now fuck him. I can't believe he tried to convince me that he was any different than the rest. Can't believe I was buying his load of crap. He's the same at the rest of the population that has a dick. I don't want to see him right now. I asked him if he was sure. Fucker.  When I say, "they're all the same" Alex wants me to say, except him. He did the same fucking shit to me. He betrayed me. I can't fucking trust any guys right now. I do it to humor him, but he doesn't know I know what he's done. Gah!  How can someone keep up with so many identities? I don't understand. I wish I knew who the real friggin person was. All I can do is remember the good times. The time we fell asleep in the hammock, and when I was chasing him around the yard. When he wrestled me so his psycho cousin could beat me up. When we washed his car, watched movies. Drove around. Got caught by the cops. Got caught in the Love One Another Church parking lot..  I dont' want to be anybody's friend right now. I want to push everyone the fuck away. Leave me alone. I hate you all.

      I need some closure.&nbsp;  I really feel like things are unfinished.&nbsp;   Lately I guess I have reviewed how I have treated people.&nbsp; I guess it's been shit.&nbsp; Spencer and I were laughing about all the times that I have made fun of so many people.&nbsp; Man, I was a bitch.&nbsp; Al and I were just on the phone discussing him.&nbsp; He really deserves what he gets.&nbsp; It's not like I should be the one to show him how it is though.&nbsp;   Jason is the same as the rest.&nbsp; Fuck guys.&nbsp; I hate them right now.

      Gosh, I've been thinking about alot lately.  For starters, I found out the other day that it was Alex who told Kelli all that stuff about Logan and me.&nbsp; I thought I could trust him.&nbsp; Apparently not.&nbsp; I guess I forgive him for it, but right now I'm proceeding with caution.&nbsp; I don't know how close to him I can actually get without seriously trusting him.   Saw a guy in the Army today.&nbsp; Reminded me of my brother.&nbsp; Wonder how he's doing.&nbsp; Everyone asks why I never talk to him.&nbsp; I have nothing to talk about.&nbsp; I haven't seen him since he was sixteen and now he's almost twenty.&nbsp; Seems like yesterday.&nbsp; He's supposed to be coming home for a couple of weeks in Oct, so maybe I'll gain some ground then.&nbsp; I feel so closed off from him.&nbsp; Almost like I dont' trust him.&nbsp; And I ask myself why I should have any expectations.&nbsp; He was never there when I was younger.&nbsp; He fucked things up himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does he need a second chance.&nbsp; I guess he deserves one.  Jason tells me that things are different with him.&nbsp; Not really sure about that.&nbsp; I guess it started out nice, but I think it's rapidly losing momentum.&nbsp; I think too much.&nbsp; How will this work?&nbsp; I'm very very very busy.&nbsp; And he's in college.&nbsp; I feel like he will get bored.&nbsp; I am looking for all the wrong things, I think.  Bah.  Well, I've gotta get up early for running/practice.&nbsp; TTFN

      The topic of Matt came up today.&nbsp; Gosh I miss him.&nbsp; I've thought about calling him up, but I know he won't come over, because he hates Emi so much.&nbsp; I think he's the one I miss the most.&nbsp; We weren't any thing but friends, we could have been more.&nbsp; My sister just used his vunerability to her hormonal advantage.&nbsp; God, I could kick her now for that.&nbsp; I want to hang out with him so much.&nbsp; He was my best friend who helped me through hard times.&nbsp; I wish he was here to help me now.&nbsp; I am not willing to lay it out on the line to be hurt.&nbsp; I don't want to be hurt by him again.&nbsp;   I'm a closed off bitch.  I feel like a&nbsp;bitch.&nbsp; Look what's happened to Ben.&nbsp; Gone off the deep end.&nbsp; I'm tired of hearing about him and what he's doing now.&nbsp; It's depressing.&nbsp; He's so different.&nbsp; I feel like I have done it to him.&nbsp; Was everything a lie when I dated him?&nbsp; How much was real?&nbsp; I am sick and tired of wondering these fucking questions.&nbsp; I want to know the truth, even if it hurts.&nbsp; I want to know how much he felt, how much was real, and if he truly meant anything he told me.&nbsp; Was sitting in Jason's car today... after work.&nbsp; and he has a stick shift.&nbsp; I was leaning over exactly how I used to when Ben and I were driving.&nbsp; He would kiss me on my forehead, and say I love you.&nbsp; His hand was on my arm.&nbsp; I could hear his heart.&nbsp; Jason did the same thing.&nbsp; I dont' want everything to remind me of him.&nbsp; I hate him for not meaning any of it, for using me as a pawn.&nbsp;   Megan was at work today.&nbsp; I got her side of the Jay and Katie story which was pretty interesting, since it's the third side of that story that I've heard.&nbsp; She tells me she never sees Ben, but I don't believe her.&nbsp; I think she's lying and doesn't want to tell me.&nbsp; I feel guilty for distrusting her.&nbsp; She keeps so much from me now though.&nbsp;   I don't know what to believe or who to believe.

      Jason told me last night what he thought my "inner psychie" was.&nbsp; It seemed somewhat negative.&nbsp; But mostly true.&nbsp;   I am hestitating so much when it comes to him.&nbsp; He's already like my boyfriend, I almost just don't want the label.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I'm scared of the label.&nbsp; Only because that's what Ben used me for.&nbsp; At the same time I wouldn't mind saying that I did have a boyfriend, that he was twentyone and in college.&nbsp; I think I move too fast.&nbsp; I really am timid in getting what I want.&nbsp; He is what I want, I just don't want to get hurt again.&nbsp; I'm afraid of being used.&nbsp; I know he cares for me.&nbsp;   I miss kissing Ben and saying I love you afterwards.&nbsp; Gosh, I miss that.&nbsp; I truly meant it too.&nbsp; I did with all my boyfriends.&nbsp; I loved each one in some form or fashion.&nbsp; Sometimes I wish I could just say it and mean it.&nbsp; Almost like I want to snap my fingers and love Jason.&nbsp; I care about him, but I'm not in love.&nbsp; I could see myself falling in love though somewhere down the road.&nbsp;   Apparently Jennifer thinks I'm psychotic.&nbsp; Funny since she's the one who spent a week in a hospital for her unstable mind.&nbsp; Hah.&nbsp; Interesting diagnosis from her.&nbsp; I don't mind that Ben trys to make me out as bad, especially since my friends already have a heads up.&nbsp; Everyone he's talked to already know the story, and keep coming to me and telling me what he says.&nbsp; I like it that way.&nbsp; Not that I really care, but everyone feels the need to tell me what's going on.&nbsp; I appreciate it and feel like my friends truly care about me.

      I have worked my Saturday away.  Piss.  It was especially hard because Megan did a shitty job closing.  Oh well.  Life goes on.  I hope she gets better at it.  I think Alex and Asher are going to come over and watch a movie with Emi and I tonight.  Spencer, I think, is out of town... and Nathan is watching The Village as I write.  (what a waste of time.)  I am so worn out.  Last night was really late, and today was long.  I don't know how long I will go on like this.  Not long.  This is silly, but I guess I get butterflies in my stomach now when I think of him...  I haven't felt that in a long time.  Not even with Ben.  I didn't really feel anything with him.  Tyler asks me why I went out with him.  God knows why,  becuase I sure as hell don't.  I was talking to Emi about Ben, and we came to the conclusion that I no longer have those Migraines, nor do I need my anti-depressants.  It must have been him, because now that he's gone I feel 50 times better.   Speaking of which, apparently Jennifer and Mallory came up to work yesterday.  Glad they're "subtle", since my coworkers use the same descriptions about them.  Ha, I know who it is everytime they describe them.  Well, anywho, life awaits.  TTFN

      So... Alex got mad at me today because I was flirting with Nathan.  He says I flirt with everyone including Spencer.  Whatever.  I got pissed because I don't see how it's any of his business.  Maybe he's just jealous.  I don't know.  He called me a sell-out because I told Nathan where his clogs were. (Al hid them)  I say, as far as I can tell, you're the sell out.  He knew what I meant, but for some reason he wanted to delve into it deeper.  Yeah right.  I wasn't about to get into an argument over that shit.   Spencer and I were talking about him on the way to Opry Mills tonight.  I briefly told him the story of why Big Al is such a sell out.  Nobody can believe that he'd betray me like that.  But he did.  That's the cold hard truth of it.  I want to talk to him so much sometimes, it just feels like our conversations are limited.  Spencer and I are getting closer.  Emi got mad because I really wanted to go with him to the movies.  She swears up and down that he likes me.  Everyone is messing with us about this shit.  I don't believe it's true.  Right now, I'm not laying anything out on the line.  Fuck it.  I've had a really bad past month concerning guys, and right now I don't have any time to invest.  I dont' know who I like right now either.  I really do like to flirt, I just wish things would go farther with one person in particular...  So, I got paid today and I went shopping.  I got three pairs of pants, a collared shirt, and a pair of Kangaroos for 125 dollars.  Woo!!  I'm a bargain hunter, what can I say?  I'm excited and can't wait to wear my Kangaroos.   I am not writing in this enough. I'm having trouble finding time.  I need to write more, so people can stay updated.  Oh!  Jason came by to see me at work.  Interesting.  I really wasn't prepared for that and everything was going shitty already.  I had a hard time from just breaking down in front of him and letting him have it.  Bah.  But this is all for now.  Work in the morning.   By the way, Spencer and I saw Anchorman.  Very good.  Hillarious.  You'll laugh until you cry.  =)  Peace out.

      Let me just post some stuff about my closest friends.   Alex  is probably one of a couple of people that I am closest to out of our group.  He and I are sharing a locker this year.  He can make me laugh like no one else.  He is completely independent and doesn't care what the rest of the world thinks about him.  Everyone laughs at his hair, which is always going everywhere and he has so much of it that it turns out fro-like.  Alex is also pale.  A tan for him is considered a slightly darker shade than pale.  He is honest and completely reliable.  He can be very sarcastic, and alot of people take him way to seriously.  Alex can't dance either, and prom was the first time that he's ever been to a dance of any sort.    Spencer  is the one that everyone thinks he likes me or I like him.  I walk him to just about every class (since we have everyone together) and we just fuck around with people's minds.  It's fun.  I believe Emi has a serious crush on Spencer, and right now she is mad at him because he switched from her A.P. Pych, to my A.P. Gov.  Spencer used to have a crush on me.  I'm not sure if he still does.  But his laugh is contagious.  He's very cute.  He's a hard worker and he's sensitive, and on top of that he's really smart.  He's always someone I can talk to.  Spencer has a couple of talents, and they would be running (he's very driven) and math.  For some reason math comes to him like nothing else.  I hate him for it. =P   Nathan  is a guy that I have a hard time counting on.  I really really want to, but things aren't working out.  He has recently had his heart broken, and he's usually the brunt of all our jokes but everyoen has taken it easy on him lately.  He is like the "sensitive jock" of our group.  He plays football, and he informed us today at lunch that our team is ranked fifty- fourth out of fifty five.  I congratulated him on being on the second place losing team.  He grins.  Nathan is a ladies man for sure.  Everyone wants him, and it's understandable.  He is very hot.  He likes to skate by in school by copying off of al, spence, and I, but lately everyone keeps reminding him that he's going to college.  I really think he is smart.  He is very deep and interesting to actually get to talk to.  Sometimes I take that for granted.   Jason  doesn't drive yet.  He's still either riding the cheese-wagon or he's a car rider.  I pointed out that he was a senior, and he's gonna have a hard time keeping up with us if he doesn't have a a car.  He still doesn't care.  Alot of his time is spent playing video games.  One thing I've learned about him, is he will be there for you no matter what.  I can always ask him for help on homework and he's willing to help me.   Whenever we're at lunch, Jason gets two bags of two cookies.  I am special and I always get one.  =). I always feel special.  He is very shy and introverted, but we have managed to get him to come out a bit more.   Travis  is very quiet, but loves to laugh.  He's a prankster.  He will do just about anything you ask him to, if it includes throwing Emi's pea's at Nathan while he's pretending to be doing his prose passage in A.P. Eng 4.  He has really grown on me, as has his sense of humor.   David  only has two classes with us this year.  We always laugh at him becuase his favorite word is "fuck".  Everyone plays jokes on him just to get him riled up.  He talks smack and it's so funny.  We all know he won't mess with us, and he's just angry and wants what he wants.  David will get what he wants, no matter what.  He's got the girl, the car.  He would be someone that I would have thought was "unreachable" when I was a freshman.  He is super friendly and funny.  He is always lightening the mood.   Foster  has a blonde curly afro.   Everyone says he was born with a six-pack.  I don't doubt it.  He does 1000 sit ups a day.  He works for what he has, but he's got a nice body.  And on top of that a very nice brain.  He's as smart as Spencer.  He and I talk about Ben alot especially since he was in my chem 2 class where he was the topic of alot of conversations.  He and I have connected lately, and I'm hoping we can be better friends.  He's really nice, sweet, sensitive, loves God, reliable.  He's just all around a good guy.   Megan  gets made fun of by Alex alot, only because she's trapped in a dumb blonde's body.  She can act really dumb.  She seems lost in what she wants out of life.  She's lost in her search for God.  I have offered everything to her.  She knows that whatever I have is hers.  I have been there for her through thick and thin, as she has been there for me.      Emi  is my sister, and she has recently kind of become apart of our group.  It's fun, I guess.  Sometimes it's hard to handle, becuase of Spencer.  But life goes on.  Well that's all.  These are the people my whole day is spent with.  There are a few others, but I don't know enough about them to post...

      School started yesterday.  *YAY* It's so much fun to be back, and our whole group all back together again.  I really feel so much closer to them already.  There's a group of us that has all four blocks together.  Me, Alex, Spencer, Nathan, David, Travis, Jason are all together.  And I have three blocks with Foster.  One with Emi.  And we have lunch with Megan.  Oh gosh, it's so much friggin fun.  My schecule is: A.P. Calculus A.P. English 4 A.P. Government Anatomy and Physiology  It's not really that hard, surprisingly.  The one class I am sorta worried about would be the calculus class.   Jason has me working at six. So, I go to school, go to practice, and then I go to work.   I pulled my groin muscle at practice.  Ouch, so now I have to wrap it and ice it.  It hurts uber bad.   But this is all for now.  Maybe I will find something interesting to post about in the near future.  But not for now.

      oh man.  I really love having all my friends in my classes.   Today we heard a funny story about Nathan.  Apparently he and his "girlfriend" (otherwise known as Hannah) were driving along, and decided to go "swimming" (I think he meant skinny dipping) in the pond behind his house.  He wasn't supposed to be out with her.  He starts driving through his yard with the lights off and drives on the trail... BAM!  He gets stuck in a big pile of brush.  His dad had told his neighbor that they could put their trees and crap that they cut down in their yard.  Nathan had to get his dad to help him out.  He found out later that his dad was on the front porch watching them.   Spencer and I laughed our asses off.  Thank you Big Al for the story.  Good lord, Nathan's an idiot. 7 out of 20 on your calculus test is not good Nathan...  Do not grin.  Do not laugh.  Your stupid jokes aren't funny.  Nobody's laughing with you.  We are laughing at you.   Well, been dealing with alot of crap lately.  A bunch of drama with my dad and me and some other matters.  We will see what happens.  I just hope this person doesn't fuck up again.  Otherwise they will be burned.

      A guy played this song for me the other night...  She's got a way about her I don't know what it is But I know that I can't live without her She's got a way of pleasin' I don't know what it is But there doesn't have to be a reason anyway She's got a smile that heals me I don't know why it is But I have to laugh when she reveals me She's got a way of talkin' I don't know why it is But it lifts me up when we are walkin' anywhere  She comes to me when I'm feelin' down Inspires me without a sound She touches me and I get turned around She's got a way of showin' How I make her feel And I find the strength to keep on goin'   She's got a light around her And ev'rywhere she goes A million dreams of love surround her ev'rywhere   She comes to me when I'm feelin' down Inspires me without a sound She touches me and I get turned around  She's got a smile that heals me I don't know why it is But I have to laugh when she reveals me She's got a way about her I don't know what it is, But I know that I can't live without her anyway

      Gosh. It has been almost a week since I have posted. I'm a slacker... lol. ummm I have been extremely busy, and getting busier by the day. Soccer season starts tomorrow. We have had five preseason games. My saturday was spent in smyrna at a "playday" (the team calls it a tourny..) and we did okay. We had four games. My scalp got sunburnt really bad. I hate that feeling, because then I can't brush it.  School is going well. Calculus is actually turning out fun. That sounds weird, but I really enjoy math.  I am trying to be nicer to Nathan after two weeks of relentless bashing by me and the guys...  Alex and I are getting closer. He asked me if I wanted to go to prom with him again this year. I don't really know what to say to that. It's like this: I do and I don't want to go with him. He can't dance which is a major downfall, and I can't see why he's thinking about it this early with me. Who knows. At the same time I don't want to really let him down. He's been shot down by alot of girls. I am just his friend, and I'm sure we would have a blast like we did last year. He is just hard to read. That is hard for me, because I know pretty much everything about him, and I can read him easily...  I am getting reprimanded for all these girly things that I listen to/watch now. Eh. Like Dirty Dancing Havana Nights. -This was a good movie, or so I thought... but my guy friends reprimand me for watching stuff like this. I get frustrated for not getting to be the girl in the group of guys. OH well. Sad to say, but I really liked the afro-cuban music in this movie. ON top of that... I really liked that actor. Gosh, he was cute.  but this is all for now. i'm gonna go chillax. Peace out
