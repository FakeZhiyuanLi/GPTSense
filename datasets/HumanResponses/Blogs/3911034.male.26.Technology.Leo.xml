      Today I took the first steps towards going on student exchange in the US. I hope to get into the Los Angeles campus of Ithaca University which concentrates on film & TV. Students also get assigned internships at TV & film studios such as Warner Bros and Universal - so I am really banking on getting in. It is in Burbank right next to Hollywood which is a much nicer area than the other choice California State University which is downtown LA.

      Played 18 holes of golf today. The first 9 holes I got 22over par again!!! (What are the odds) Did much better in the 2nd 9 holes with 11 over par so I'm back on track and almost ready to go have a hit with Dad.

      After Farenheit had finished and the credits started to roll the majority of the 100 or so crowd started to clap. I find this behaviour weird, do they clap at all movies? I've seen some crap films but when it was over none of the audience or myself felt the need to boo or hiss. If you saw Farenheit and people clapped let me know!

      Here is an anti-Moore website that has various bits of info about Moore. It is not that great but there is an article about Moore lifting various scenes of Farenheit from other filmmakers one of them is an Australian, represent! There is also a book out at the moment available on Amazon called "Michael Moore Is A Stupid Fat Man".  http://www.MooreWatch.com/

      This film made me snigger a lot. I was amazed by the unique individual that is George W. Bush. I had heard this film was incredibly bias but I was surprised at the restraint that was actually used. Sure Bush and his pals cop it, but David Letterman has probably showed Bush to be more of an idiot and incompetant than Moore has managed to. I did enjoy the film and it was good to see almost absolute majority new footage of Iraq war. The images of the civillian and army casualties was pretty horrific but the interviews with the teenage officers was even more shocking. I thought it was a bit too broad of a subject and I would of been more interested if the whole movie would have been of Bush, he intrigues me. The stunts Moore pulled weren't very elaborate and didn't really prove much but the interviews and research were insightful. Not as good as Bowling For Columbine and seemed a little rushed but I guess he was trying to put it out in time for the election. Story: 3/5    Production: 4/5    Film: 7/10

      Went and saw Wil Smith get jiggy with robots tonight. I didn't expect the greatest film I just hoped it would be better than the advertisements that TV has been flooded with of late. It was indeed better than the ads, but the obvious ads inside the film were a bit insulting. The filmmakers would like to thank Audi, JVC and Converse! Converse actually got a couple lines of dialogue and JVC and Audi got numerous plugs throughout the film. Other than that, the effects and overall look of the film was very clean and directed OK by Aussie Proyas represent! Being a fan of Dark City it was interesting to see his approach for I, Robot. The story wasn't overly great but the themes of prejudice and trust were pretty evident. I did enjoy it especially the robot on robot battles and the cute old school robots which are replaced. The robots did move a bit like the robots from Phantom Menace but that is to be expected. Story: 2/5   Production: 4/5    Film: 6/10

      Played golf today for the first time in about 10 years. I played at the Merrimac 9 hole course which is the first one I ever played on. It is a piece of crap but cheap $8 for 9 holes. I got 52 on the par 30 so I was 22 over but got progressively better as the game went on. I'll try to play once a week to get me out of the house.   This is not the course!

      I have not left my house now for 48hours and it looks like being 72hours before I leave again. In Japan this behaviour is called Hikikomori, it has become a major problem with some Japanese males staying in their rooms for like 6months or longer. I'll keep you posted on my progress.

      I learnt a big lesson a few years back Fiona wanted to go see Fight Club at the cinemas. I was like "Brad Pitt! No chick flicks!". I hesitantly agreed to go along to see it at Showcase Cinema in Newcastle. I was pleasantly surprised when David Fincher's name came up and it turned out to be an awesome film. Even though I loved Se7en and 12 Monkeys I still thought Pitt was a pretty boy, after Fight Club I changed my opinion and I no longer avoided Pitt films. This has been a bit of a bad move since as I have sat through Legends Of The Fall, Spy Game, Interview With A Vampire, Troy and Meet Joe Black and have found pretty much fluff. The Mexican was vaguely acceptable and Oceans Eleven was enjoyable though. I did however re-watch Kalifornia and Pitt is pretty awesome in what is a pretty shite film. Thanks to Brad Pitt I will watch pretty much anything. If you have seen any other good or bad Pitt films let me know.

      Watched City Of God last night on DVD and was pretty much blown away. Wish I had seen it on the big screen, like the ghetto it is set in there is so much going on my TV screen doesn't do it justice. The cinematography, direction and editing made the film so real, being based on a real story I imagine that is what they were trying to do.  The depiction of the 60s, 70s and 80s  and the depth of the information presented in the film was top notch. Loved it! Story:   5/5  Production:   5/5    Film:   10/10

      My lil brother Ben and I are having a stand off over who is going to take the rubbish to the big bin in our housing complex. The main problem is it is about 100m down the street past the swimming pool and tennis court so it is easier to drive there. I guess I can do it tomorrow when I check the mail which is another 50m on top of that and outside the complex.

      Jeremy paid a four figure sum to play for Conference team Barnet against Arsenal in a pre-season friendly on Saturday. Barnet lost 10-1 and Jeremy got 4 minutes on the pitch towards the end of the game and managed to get a couple touches of the ball. Nice work Jeremy your a true football fan!

      Finally saw elephant at the Gold Coast Arts Centre. I enjoyed how Van Sant shot the film with quite a short depth of field. The glimpses into the school through following the characters with long steady camera shots was quite weird at first but made sense towards the end. I was even able to work out part of the plan of the school from it. As far as the film as a whole is concerned it was ok, not quite what i'm looking for in a film. I guess I was more impressed with the production side of it. The direction and the way Van Sant used actual students in an actual high school with improvised dialogue was great.

      Went and watched my soccer club, Griffith University play in the quarter finals of the Gold Coast FA Cup. it was a bit of a David and Goliath battle with Goliath winning 4-2. The Griffith boys barely had a team with the majority of their regulars back home in Norway for the holidays. After a couple dodgy goals the Gold Coast Knights went into the break 2nil but didn't look too convincing. Griffith came out in the second half a lot stronger but the Knights got another goal, 3nil. The show wasn't over with Griffith coming back with a couple quick goals, 3-2. After a couple of missed opportunities for Griffith to level the score the Knights scored another to put the game out of reach of Griffith.

      Went and saw Dirty Pretty Things last night. Loving Audrey Tautou she's the bomb! I was pleasantly suprised when the film started and i was the only one in attendance.  The pleasantness was dashed when two girls walked in 5 minutes into the film and decided to whisper throughout the whole film, urrrghh! After the film finished they left and one declared "That is the worst film i have ever seen!". Nice to know they were watching whilst whispering. Well i enjoyed it, nice english film about illegal immigrants working shit jobs and looking out for each other whilst getting involved in the underground human kidney trade. Audrey was treated a bit rough in it though. :( Story: 4/5    Production: 3/5   Film:7/10

      Probably the most secretive person I have ever known is Mark Roberts. He is quite an interesting character and since I saw that old photo again I have been thinking of things he used to say and do. I f you have seen this man let me know. I think Deano hasn't seen him for like a year or something so I am intrigued as to where he is and what he is up to.   "Remember in 1982 when they solved the mystery of the Loch Ness monster?"

      17yr old Spaniard Cesc Fabregas (Ces-say Fab-re-gas) gets my Legend of the Week for his mature and confident displays for Arsenal during the last two games. Despite the fact he has one of the best Joe Dirt style hair dos he is running circles around players 10yrs his senior and earning  3 times his wage if not more! I was going to pre-empt him as Legend of the Week before last nights game but I thought I'd give him a chance to prove himself and he passed with flying colours. Expect big things from this youngster in the not too distant future. Everton 1 - 4 Arsenal.

      Me and Polar Bear went to Starbucks last night in Cavill Mall. We have been there about 4 times in the last 6 months and the last time we were there was about 3 and a half weeks ago. Anyway the Starbucks guy recognised me as a regular customer and knew I was going to order a hot chocolate with cream. He gave me a stamp card for future visits. Considering there has been atleast 1000 people enter starbucks since my last visit this guy has an exceptional memory or he is stalking me.  Ben "Polar Bear" Davies at Starbucks.

      Last night I got out probably the most shocking and unforgetable film I have ever seen. The French film Irreversible is basically about the boyfriend and the ex-boyfriend of a woman who is raped and bashed going out to get revenge. It takes place over about 5hours over the course of one night. Kinda like Memento the scene order of the film is reversed and the credits roll at the start. The whole film is shot with one camera with no cuts in each scene.  The acting and direction of the film is top notch with some scenes going for 10-15mins. The special fx in Irreversible are probably the best that I have seen this year including Spiderman2 and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. They are so subtle and at times I was awestruck into almost believing they were real. The first 25 minutes is pretty crazy especially the first ten minutes I thought I wasn't going to be able to sit through the whole film the camera movements were so irratic but it does become clear why it is used. Gaspar Noe has made a basic story into something incredible. I'm surprised the Australian censorship board didn't ban this film. Considering they banned Ken Park which is play shool compared to this because it is French it probably slipped through because not many people would see it. If it wasn't for the intense 5min rape and bashing scene I would recommend this to everyone. I'm going to give this film a 10 I haven't been so disturbed by a film in a long time. Monica Bellucci is so beautiful in this, what is it with my French ladies getting treated so poorly - first Audrey now Monica!  Story: 5/5   Production: 5/5   Film: 10/10

      Made an appearance in a one minute video we filmed in my Advanced Digital Video class today. I was surprised I actually took on the role with no apprehension. Of course it was a small role but we did the majority of the filming in front of atleast one hundred students coming and going to their classes. I'll post some pics from the film tomorrow.

      After 8 years at Arsenal, Pat Vieira looks likley to set sail to Spain in search of Champions League glory with Real Madrid. Arsenal may lose their captain and best central midfielder but considering he missed about a quarter of last season and the Gunners were still undefeated Arsenal have shown they can cope with such a big loss. No hard feelings towards "La Grande Saucisse" regardless of what happens over the next couple days. In a time of mercenary players he and most of Arsenal have stuck together through good and bad. Good luck Vieira, just don't take Henry with u next season!

      Had some free time after Uni today so I went and had a look at the Chronicles of Riddick. Bit of a weird film but I always am interested in sci-fi films. The overall appearance of the film was pretty spectacular. The effects were very top notch especially the external scenes on the various planet surfaces with there different atmospheres. The space ships were done very realistically with heat distorting the surroundings. Vin Diesel was his normal robot self. The story was a bit slow at first but then started rolling along nicely but sort of stopped suddenly and left issues unresolved. I could of done with another half hour to be fully satisfied. More disappointing was the similarities to other films like Dune, The Mummy, Pitch Black and The Matrix. Story: 2/5   Production: 4/5   Film: 6/10
