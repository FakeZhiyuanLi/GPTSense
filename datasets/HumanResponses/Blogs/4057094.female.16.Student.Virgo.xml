       Hello, hello, hello, hellooooooooooo...just kidding. Hi! Lol, ok I'll stop with the hello's now. **Sigh** Today was a bit tiring for me. I woke up at 7 and then fell asleep and woke up again at 9. I showered and then got ready. I went to my mom's friend's house to help them bring a couch to where they live. After that I went to some moving truck place. I guess it's almost like "U-Haul" but it's called "Penske", well yeah I went there to go drop off a truck because my cousin and her boyfriend and kids came from North Carolina to visit&nbsp;or something, I don't know but they brought a moving truck with all there stuff and everything, so yeah. Then we went to Lotaburger and came home and ate. Then my cousin and her boyfriend left to get an oil change for their Caddy or Cadillac. And I stayed home and watched the kids. But it kinda sucked because my allergies started acting up and it started around 12 and it went all down hill from there. I took some allergy pills. It said Day-Time Allergy Relief or something like that. So I thought it wasn't supposed to make you drowsy but I guess it did...or well it made me.&nbsp; I was watching Shrek with my little cousin and I kept falling asleep. I kept thinking her mom would walk in the door any second. But my allergies went away. So that was nice.&nbsp; Then I went outside to play with my cousins and came back in because mosquitos were starting to bite me. I guess I'm just&nbsp; juicy...just kidding..haha. Anyways, I watched a little bit of Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune... Around 7 my cousins left to go see my other relatives. Baby-sitting was alright. The kids weren't bad...they listened and I got payed $20, so that was good. Yup.&nbsp; Matt called me earlier this evening...at like 9:45...well I guess at night..lol but something was wrong with him because he sounded a bit down. He wouldn't tell me why. I don't know but it's weird talking to him, because like he always says things to me and I start thinking he likes me..which he probably doesn't. Oh geez..it's sooo confusing. Why are guys confusing? But he would say stuff like....fine..and I would say fine...and he says...yeah I know you are....and I could tell by what he means...I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. Or he would say, something like...yeah really?...and I say yeah...really..and he'll say..wow you're really pretty..and then he'll say something else real fast..to cover it up. It's like he doesn't come out saying it...but he does it all secretly...it's tough to explain...but I hope you're getting me. And then I'm supposed to be getting a call from my friend but I don't know what's up with her. She and her ex-boyfriend are talking again and I kinda get the feeling like they're going to get back together, even though she says she won't. Because he treats her like crap and she knows it....it just bothers me a lot though. Well I guess I better get going now...Bye!    &nbsp;

        Well hello everyone. Today&nbsp; is going alright for me. I woke up at 6:30 because my back started hurting...I swear, I think I'm an old lady.&nbsp; I did my usual thing. This time no call from my friend, Matt, the one I told you about yesterday. Anyways, I took a shower....cleaned the house....did the laundry, woke up my sister and told her to go in the shower...and called my mom to see who had called me earlier. That's pretty much it. Yesterday my mom nearly killed herself with the lawn mower. She was outside&nbsp; mowing the lawn and then it started to rain. Did that stop her? Nooooo...she kept on mowing. Then it started to thunder...and you could tell the lightning was near, did that stop her? Nooo....she kept on mowing until she was done.&nbsp; I swear she is stubborn. I just hope I don't become as stubborn or nearly as stubborn as she is. Then this morning I found out that one of my mom's cousin's or relatives died this morning. I knew&nbsp; who he was but I like didn't know him enough to were I would be weary and all down the whole day. I mean don't get me wrong...I am sad that had happend. I jsut hope my momma will be okay. I guess since that happend I have to go out of town this weekend and I really don't want to. If I do, then I want to tell my mom that I want to see my dad. Now that's another story. You see what happend was that my dad had left us when I was in the 8th grade..which was almost 3 years ago. He had been cheating on my mom with her best friend...and ugh..everything was just chaos. I mean..that was my mom's best friend. When my mom had found out that my dad had been cheating on her..she went to her friend...but my mom never he was with her friend..she alwasys thought it was someone else...but then she found out...Boy was she mad. I was pretty upset too. But I was soo close to my dad...we were like best friends..then all of a sudden he just leaves. But yeah...I haven't seen him since the week after Valentines Day this year. Oh yeah and another thing, my mom found out about this whole cheating thing&nbsp; like 2 days after Valentines Day. That kinda sucks. Well I guess I better get going now...sorry for the whole story..there's much more to it...leave a comment or something if you want to know more. Later!

       Hey guys! I hope everyone's day is going good. Let's see...today I didn't really do anything. I woke up a little before 7:00 am because one my friends called me. I have no idea why. He just did. He seems to always be doing that kind of stuff. Sometimes I wonder if he likes me...but then again I think he doesn't because he has a girlfriend. I would ask him but I don't want to look like an idiot when he tells me he doesn't. Plus I don't want to feel this awkwardness between us when we talk. So I just don't know what to do. The reason I think those things because he calls me very late at night and really early in the morning...and I'm the only one he does that too. Plus he told me awhile back that he liked me...nothing escalated from that. And then he told me that I was pretty on the phone this morning...I just keep thinking that maybe he's delusional or verrry tired when he's saying these things. Oh well....anyways, after that I listened to music and then sat there doing nothing. So I went back to sleep and then I woke up around 12. I watched the news...and watched a movie...then I got ready...and then I went and watched some more t.v. Then I made dinner and went to my room and texted my friend. All of a sudden I got the urge to check my email...so I did and to my surprise I got an email from someone! Woohoo! Just kidding. Well anyways...after that...I decided to do this. So here I am. Well I guess I better get going...talk to you all later!
