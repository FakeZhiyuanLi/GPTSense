        urlLink Google   This is my favorite site. It isnt my favorite site just because it is the best search engine online but because it does so much to make going online more fun. Its email service is great and not even finished. and it has links to other great places like Blogger.

        urlLink Gmail - Inbox (1)   This is the Gmail site where i get all of my mail. Right now Gmail isnt totaly finished and i am just using a beta version for testing. I had to go through alot of trouble to get this email. Since Gmail is not widely avalibe yet google is giving certain people Gmail and 10 invites. The person with the invites can let 10 other ppl use Gmail. People made sites so ppl with invites could hook up with people without Gmail and wanting it so they can have the invite. Im not sure but i think if you got invited by a person not by Gmail then you dont get any invites but im not totaly sure. I didnt get any invites to give out. I think this is the best email service avalable that i have heard of. It has so many features to sort you mail as you store it or as it comes it. It also has a spam blocker and a folder that it puts spam in but i havent got any spam and never have in the past so i can not say how good that is. I would recomend to try to get Gmail if you can. It would be worth it.
