       Well, today is the day. At about high noon I will be under the knife, and I sort of can't wait for this thing to be over. I'd appreciate your thoughts/ prayers. I might be able to update/ talk online on a laptop, since I won't be able to sit for a week or two. I can't wait for that (note: read with sarcasm).

       So I ran around town today, doing some errands con mi madre, and the last thing we did was cash a ninety- five hundred dollar check. The check, my inheiritance from some distant aunt or great aunt of mine who I never met before she died, will pay for the car that I am currently driving. That will happen soon, when the lease runs out and I buy off the car. Plus I will have a little (about 500) left from interest and leftover that I can use towards a large purchase. So even though I never met this lady, she has impacted my life in a very big and positive way. I can only hope to do things along the same lines.

                 So I just saw  urlLink Spinal Tap , one of the funniest and creative movies ever. I recomend it to everyone who enjoys subtle humor, creative writing, and good humor. Along the same lines, I can now see R rated movies without a parent. Woo hoo. Yeah for being 17.       Another random thought. As of right now I wear boxers, but I am considerating the switch to boxer briefs, allowing more support without being too constricting. I am afraid that I would miss the freedom of boxers, though. Perhaps a blend of both would suffice.       Also, a little story about today. I woke up around 330 in the afternoon because of my tiredness from the trip, and learned that I would be helping some old folks get rid of their vinal records at 415. So I go up to their door (I have already helped them out before) and some random old lady appears and I, being polite, had their newspaper in my hand. She grabs the paper, and without a word begins closing the door. So I explain that I thought that I was supposed to be getting some records, and she yells down to Mrs. McComis that I was here, and finally let me into the house. I am still not sure who she was, but I then spent 45 minutes putting a heck of a lot of records into boxes and carrying them out to my car. I didnt know those things were that heavy, but I guess carrying about 300 at a time will do that. So my little car is full and riding about an inch lower, and I need to take them and some other stuff to Salvation Army sometime tomorrow.  That was an interesting experience, and its kinda sad because the McComises have lived their their entire married life (they are early 70s) and now have to pack up everything they have accumulated over 50 odd years and move into a retirement community.    It is a little early in my life to say this, but I really dont think I want to be preserved by medicine when I am getting up there in years. It seems more than a little useless to me to have my kids paying for my health care when it only prolongs my life ( which by that stage is poor in quality) by a couple months, not to mention the massive costs of medication for old folks, and the strong probability that medicare will expire when my generation needs it. I understand that kids want their parents to live for a long time, etc, but look at something like Ronald Reagan. The guy was decimated by Alzheimers for a decade before he died. He didn't truely live for over ten years. I really do not want to live like that. So  go live your life to the fullest, cause you only got a few years. Don't waste it sitting around watching tv or doing something that you don't enjoy        "Well, I don't really think that the end can be assessed as of itself as being the end because what does the end feel like? It's like saying when you try to extrapolate the end of the universe, you say, if the universe is indeed infinite, then how - what does that mean? How far is all the way, and then if it stops, what's stopping it, and what's behind what's stopping it? So, what's the end, you know, is my question to you.

        urlLink  After kids club on monday and tuesday, we would join the rest of the group working on building another classroom for the elementary school. Our job was to level the ground inside of the 4 foot high cinder block walls, so that we could eventually pour concrete. This work was incredibly frustrating for me, because it entailed moving/relocating vast amounts of clay, and I only got to work for two or three hours total. Why? Because it is the wet season in Jamaica, and when we started at one o clock it would begin pouring at 230 or 3, and we were not allowed to work through rain. After work, we would shower and have free time until 530, then we would eat, have evening program, and have some time with our church groups before bed.     On tuesday, our evening program was pretty cool. Brad (the evening program guy) set up stations all around the school, most dealing with who we are, and self reflection. One station allowed us the time to just sit down and look out over the valley, where there were lights and fires from all the Jamaicans, as well as an awesome lightning storm out in the distance. This reminder of Gods power is something that will stay with me for a while. Also, one station had you create something that symbolized the week so far by making something out of duct tape. That was interesting.     Wednesday was our day off, and we got up for a three hour bus ride to Dunns river falls, where there was a beach and a set of waterfalls that we could climb. The waterfalls were really nice, the water was cold, and we did that twice. Some people from the group snorkeled or just relaxed at the beach. We then went a couple miles away to Ocho Rios, where there was a market and some restaurants. The marketplace was interesting- everything was bought by bartering- and the sellers were very entertaining. We met some serious rastafarians (Jamaicans who smoked a lot of pot and had not cut their hair for 20-30 years.)     We then got to the restaurant where our church was eating at 545, and we had to leave by 7. Here, we waited and waited, and our appetizers arrived at about 7, and we didnt leave until 830. we got back to Catadupa at 1130 and went to sleep. On thursday we switched workplaces, and headed down to the market at Catadupa to rebuild part of it. This worksite I liked much better because we interacted with Jamaicans much more. That morning one guy was cooking for us, and he was making codfish and dumplings, with some breadfruit. All morning we were smelling this stuff cook and it smelled great. We learned a lot about how to make that particular dish, and he showed Jesse Raines and me how to make the dumplings- Jesse could do it but I couldnt. We also befriended a guy named Twinney, who I'll tell you about later. It began raining during lunch, so we didnt get to work in the after noon.         The community threw a party for us that night, with some people selling us things and people cooking jerk chicken and power water (goats head soup). Both dishes were delicious. A couple of us bought shirts and such, and I bought a turtle and two pipes ( and I was asked if I wanted anything to put in the pipes, and he wasnt talking tobacco. I declined). Then, with some late 90s pop songs blasting and the food cooking, Jesse, Adam, and I went over to Twinney and started talking about the marketplace. Then we asked him a couple of questions, and then we started talking about marijuana. He was really stoned and excited to talk about his favorite subject. It turns out that most Jamaicans only smoke heavily when they are working (Twinney said he had ten that morning, these were fresh fatties, about a centimeter and a half diameter). He also listed off the uses- boil it and eat it like cabbage, make tea, squirt it in your eye to make it better, make wine, and on and on. We didnt really have to ask much, he loved talking. He then said he would bring us a plant to show us on Friday. We didnt really think he would, but the next morning he pulled Adam and I aside and took us into this little meat shop (just a little shack, not exactly clean) and reached behind a fusebox and pulled it out, and handed it to Adam. That was pretty funny. We worked for the rest of the morning on painting the skeleton of the roof, and then we mixed some mortar. To do that, you have to only use the smallest particles of the sand, so we used the seive that gold miners use, shaking it furiously to get the little stuff onto the ground. It was intensely hard work.     By the end of the day, the pittsburg group had already left (they got there a day early) and it hit us that we were leaving already the next morning. I really didnt want to come home, and I still wish I was in Jamaica. Its hard to descirbe the difference in cultures. In Jamaica everyone says hello to everyone, everybody wants to make sure everybodys doing ok, and they sincerly mean it.Its very laid back, things are frequently late, and its all good. "no worries, mon" they'd say. Here its completely different, and I can;t help feeling caught up in the rush of America. We drive our SUVs because we feel a need for power, not because we go offroading. In jamaica they drive little toyota sedans on roads with potholes the size of bathtubs, and they enjoy it because they can stop and talk to people while crossing them. Here we live in montrously huge houses- look at windom hills, where four person families have houses in which 30 people could live comfortably. Jamaican houses have a kitchen, with a bedroom and common area, with 8 person families. The houses are the size of typical windom hills living room. The funny thing is, these people who live in filth, without electricity and little education, are ten times happier than your average York Suburban High School student. There is something to be said for the power of love, something freely given in Jamaica. We complain about something not going just right  every day.  And I am not different. We have incredible comfort, financial stability, and resources, yet we do nothing of value with them.     If you didnt know already, I am supposed to have surgery soon-  urlLink pilonidal cyst - and it was scheduled for tomorow, but has been changed to friday. This cyst thing has been incredibly annoying and sometimes painful, but mostly annoying. It will be a blessing to get rid of it, but i wont be able to drive, sit for long periods of time, run around, play sports, or do much of anything for a couple of weeks. So, i would appreciate some prayers for that. The good thing is that I now get a couple more days of activity, but the recooperation will be that much longer. I hope that no one else that I know gets it, cause it has made my life kind of difficult.

               Hey ya. So much to talk about on this here first entry. I'll start by summarizing my summer. I laid around for awhile, sleeping, and that was nice, then headed to Wildwood, (New Jersey: the armpit of America) for Fun in the Son, a christian youth conference. That was womping good. David Crowder and friends (music group) rocked and the speakers had solid messages. Then home for a few days before a short trip to visit my aunt and uncle in louisvile KY. We went to a few minor league baseball games, and it was pretty fun. Then summer got interesting.   After that trip, I prepared to go on a missiontrip to Jamaica. I didnt know much about the island, other than the fact that there were pretty much two locations, the resorts and the real Jamaica. Most white people are tourists who travel to a Carribbean island like Jamaica and never see what the island is really like. I knew that as missionaries, we would be in the "untouristy" part of the island, but I was utterly floored by my surroundings when we arrived. We flew into Montego Bay (beautiful beaches, fast food, and tourists; everything that I really dislike) and waited around, ate lunch at the airport (at this amazing little restaurante entitled Island Grilll), played cards, and relaxed (we had gotten up at 330 that morning) until a second group arrived sans their youth leader. He (Matt Otto, very cool guy, 24 yrs old) had been the person without a seat on the plane due to overbooking. So we loaded the buses and began the trip                   to a town called Catadupa, located                   twentysome miles away. We stopped to exchange all 40 peoples US money into Jamaican dollars, called "J"s (exchange rate is 60 J to one US dollar) While we waited on the bus for the leaders to do this, we experienced a taste of the Jamaican culture, that is, everyone who walked by wanted to make sure we were having fun and enjoying ourselves. Well apparently one man (probably tweaked up on weed, which is obviously a huge part of their culture) made some moves on a girl or two in our group. These girls proceeded to calmly ignore him. This upset the man greatly, and he started screaming at us, calling us fake Christians, and saying that what we stood for was bullpoop (he used stronger language). He left (after actually boarding our bus to yell at us), and the guys in the front of the bus were greatly confused, because we didnt know that he had been touching girls and saying some rude things, and we thought that they should have just talked to him. This caused some angst in the group until it was all settled, but it was an interesting way to begin the trip.   We then traveled up some mountains, flying around blind turns in a coach-sized bus on a road that was about 20 feet wide and two lanes. It was insane. Along the way, we saw immense foliage, immense beauty, and immense poverty. The drivers in Jamaica are amazing, the horns are used for saying hello, goodbye, hows it going, im coming around a turn at 50 kph, etc, but never in anger, and we navigated bridges in this huge bus over which I would be frightened to drive a sedan. We then arrived in Catadupa, and went to the elementary school where we slept. A 40ish person group from pittsburg was already there (our group of 22 and the maryland group of 12 made a total of around 80) and we settled in and had some free time. About6 oclock I learned that Adam Hake ( who plays the jimbay and is wicked good) some girls who sing and myself on guitar would be leading worship that night at 730. I got out my guitar, and lo and behold when I was tuning it my G-string broke. I was repairing it and my backup g string broke. At dinner Brad (the evening program coordinator) asked me in front of the entire group if I was ready to go that night. I decided to break some "ice" between the groups, so I said "All I need is a G-string." Everyone laughed and it was all good. I then went to tune my guitar sans gstring, and my Dstring broke. So I borrowed Matt Otto's (who still had not arrived) guitar for the night.  Sunday was church, which absolutly rocked. Pastor Leroy, the Jamaican connection with World Servants (the organization we went with), gave one of the most passionate and well constructed sermons I have ever heard. Then, he was kinda asking the crowd if anyone wants to sing a song, say some words, etc later in the service, and Amy (the main World Servants staffperson) asked if Adam, the girls, and myself would do a version of Amazing grace that we had written a little while ago. So we went up and Adam used the drum set and there was an eltric guitar for me, a rather nice one, and I pluged in and strummed an A chord. I had already realized that I had no pick so I was a little "tense" about how it would sound and such. Well guess what. The Jamaicans who did the music didnt use the guitar at all that day for a reason. It was dreadfully out of tune. I quickly tried to tune a could notes, but Adam had started playing and the girls were already singing, so I played mostly horrible sounding power chords very softly. That was interesting. Later that day the three Jamaicans who played music were chilling at our home for the week, and I walked past them with my half dead guitar (two pegs are chipped and held in w/ duct tape, and some other stuff is messed up). They grabbed my guitar, threw on my strings for me (using a b string for the g ) and we played around for a good hour, hour and a half, playing some worhip songs that were familiar to all of us. It was very cool.  Then on monday, we did music for kids club. I dont think of myself as good with kids, and I kinda dont like little kids very much. However, the kids in Jamaica are amazing. This is kinda gonna turn into a little rant against American society. I find that little kids here in the states are horribly spoiled, selfish, and sheltered. Parents cater to their every whim, and most middle class and upper class kids are complete brats. I can't stand them. The same aged kids in Jamaica dont want the latest toy, dont want more video games, dont want anything except love. That, I discoverd, I can do. Little girls (ages 5-8 ish) actually were sitting me down and doing my hair, little kids of all ages all wanted to climb on everyone, and I had at least two on my back/arms/neck/waist/legs at all times. This one little guy drew a picture of me, goatee and all, and shyly gave it to me. I dont cry easily, and I tend to not show much emotion; i could be incredibly happy or angry, and I kinda always have the same expression on my face. However, this is a little kid whom i had met for about 10 minutes, had been on my back for a bould and in my lap for a coule, and he all of a sudden wanted to give me a picture he had drawn. At that point i didnt even know the kids name (it was CJ). I had trouble for a couple minutes, cause I was dumbfounded by this kid. He had nothing, I was the rich white missionary coming to Jamaica for only a week before coming back to my massive home in the US to live in sickening comfort. And  he  was giving me something he had made, and this was after a couple minutes. wow. Kids club was the first real wakeup call God gave me this past week, telling me that He can do things in very unexpected ways- I would never have guessed that the two days I spent at kids club- about 5 hours in all- would be the highlight of the trip for me. Another cool thing at kids club was on tuesday, when the same amazing kids (125 of them in all) came back and displayed the same need for love and giving it freely that shocked me and amazed me. with about 5 inutes left at kids club, we were lining the kids up to leave, and I had a little group of about 6 kids that were all over me that day, and I was kinda herding them out, and they left. I was just walking around and I felts this little hand grab my pinky finger. I looked down and this adorable little girl said "lift me up" and I did. In about a minute she was asleep, her head on my shoulder. She slept for a bit and then woke up, and would not let go. 15 minutes later she had to be pried off of me. It was a very cool experience, to be able to fill her need for love for just 15 minutes was awesome.   All this while we had been getting to know the community members, and the attitude of Jamaica, the "no problem, mon", and "no worries" ; the laid back and extremely friendly and open culture was awesome. I felt myself kind of just slipping in, and I found that if something was late, or if the toilet was rank or showers occured when it was raining so all the clothes were wet, or whatever problemswe encountered, I was able to simply trust in God to take care of it, and to not stress out over anything. It was wonderful.    Well, its late and I have some crazy Montezuma's revenge from the trip. There is so much more and it will have to wait until tomorow. Congrats on actually reading this far, if anyone did. The trip was awesome- if anyone wants to talk about it or what-have-you, comments etc, drop me a line or comment or something. This blogs for both my use and yours- you get to  see a little of how my brain works, my thoughts, and my opinions, and I want some feedback. If I say something on here that you disagree with, I want to hear from you. thats enough for tonight.     I leave with a quote                   and a short reflection                   ... Carl Sandburg claimed  "          I won't take my religion from any man who never works except with his mouth."      God is love, and to simply say it is not enough. I met people in Jamaica who were inspired by the mere fact that we rich white people cared about them enough to come and give a week of our lives to better theirs. This process of putting faith into action is found in every religion, from Islam to Christianity to Hinduism etc. Sometimes as Christians we tend (as I use a horribly overused cliche) to talk the talk and not walk the walk. I believe mission work of any kind, whether it be in Africa, South America, Europe, or York, Pennsylvania, elaborate missions or simple compassion to a neighbor, is what we need to do in order to have any kind of spiritual life. This is the Great Commision, and fulfilling it is extremely satisfying.     Peace    Ryan Mosser

       Oh my goodness, sitting rocks. I sat for about ten minutes today, and I cant describe the awesomeness. I am at the point where things that I usually find horribly boring are now engaging and entertaining: for instance, I watched an entire soccer game on tv, as well as one of those espn documentarys about the 1968 steelers team or whatever. I have also read every profile on my "buddy list". And seen most of the democratc national convention.      Good news: the US Open series is on espn, and it gives me a couple good hours of tennis. Also, the daily show and late night tv (letterman then conan) are fantastic. I love walker texas ranger (but only when the clips are short and taken out of context.).

       i havent done anything since friday. I dont wanna complain, but this is sucking more each day- I feel better each day, but I still am nowhere near normal. So I feel better, but still cant do anything for several weeks.  weeks.    I'll get better eventually    I watched  urlLink Serpico  yesterday- go see it. its a late 70s movie with Al Pacino. My dad saw it back when he was young (er) and liked Serpico so much he grew his beard out and bought a hat to look like him.  urlLink Here is a pic of Serpico.  Picture my dad looking like that, walking around the streets of philly. Wow.     Well, on my road to recovery i have been able to watch a lot of tv that I usually dont watch, like Queer Eye for the straight guy, trading spaces, lot of Game Show network, etc. And now I am going to watch what is sure to be another installment of TV reaching new lows, with Fox's "trading spouses." Weeee.

       Hello there. I have not sat or put any pressure on my bum since friday. This is extraordinarily annoying. My brother got me a laptop w/ wireless connection, so I wont be quite as bored. If anyone has any suggestions for things to pass the time, let me know: TV sucks, I have several movies, and I have a lot of summer reading to do for history and english. By the way. If there are any AP euro people out there, I kinda need a copy of the reading list.     Peace

       I havent been sleeping well since surgery, and I have been having some seriously wacked out dreams. Last night it was that Pat Kirby's family won the lottery and moved somewhere, and sold the house to 15 kids from Suburban for like 2 dollars. And the entire dream was about 15 guys living together. It was crazy.  I cut my nails today.

       I really have no need to update this cause my days are indistinguishable.  It looks like I might be putting together a slideshow for the Jamaica mission trip reunion party shindig. So if anyone has any pictures on disc, let me know or drop them off here so I can do that. I really need to do something with my time, and since I can't quite motivate myself to reread  Owen Meany , a really good book that I need to summarize chapter by chapter as well as comment, in addition to keeping a list of characters with descriptions. And do that for  Snow falling on cedars.  Both books are fantastic, but as in all scholastic pursuits, busywork depresses me. Plus I have to read three books for history. Time management is not my forte.   urlLink this land

       the internets been down for two days, not allowing me to communicate through the usual means. Thats been a bummer  I am depressed. I have been outside only three times in a week and a half. I am completely bored. People say they are bored, but try not being able to sit for more than 10-15 minutes, not being able to do any physical activity, and have the damned tv for entertainment.There is nothing intelectually stimulating on tv so I watch bad 80s sitcoms until I doubt if I will be able to "think critically" come september.  I woke up this morning at noon, realized it doesnt matter what I do, when I get up  cause I cant do anything. So I slept until 3. And have been frickin laying for a week and a half. I havent had an appetite for two weeks, cause I get no exercise. I am too depressed to get any work done for school. pray for me

       "The fourth lesson schools teach is indifference. By bells and other concentration-destroying technology, schools teach that nothing is worth finishing because some arbitrary power intervenes both periodically and aperiodically. If nothing is worth finishing, nothing is worth starting. Don’t you see how one follows the other? Love of learning can’t survive this steady drill. Students are taught to work for little favors and ceremonial grades which correlate poorly with their actual ability. By addicting children to outside approval and nonsense rewards, schools make them indifferent to the real power and potential that inheres in self-discovery reveals. Schools alienate the winners as well as the losers." ~ Excerpt from John Gatto's The Underground History of American Education  read that excerpt carefully   urlLink http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/index.htm   credit to Andrew Purcell for enelightening the world

       here is my future as I see it:  -read five required books by september first -relax and have fun junior year, get a "B" for a marking period for the first time ever -do the usual for summer '05- beach thing with church, mission trip, frisbee, sleep, go places by car -get accepted to a college in new england, such as BU, where I can relax and not work to hard -have one heck of a senior year -go to europe for a month or two over the summer, just traveling wherever and whenever and sleeping mainly             where I feel like it, and spending as little money as possible- If you wanna join me let me know -spend four years in college studying something that interests me, like history - determine if I wanna teach high school or college, get a degree - Find a job somewhere, probably in europe, (ireland, perhaps, maybe sweden) - teach for a while - open/buy/own a pub, bartend during the summer - laugh at americans who are too busy, stressed out, and concerned about money - laugh some more   if I could do what is on this list, I would be the happiest man alive

       i have been slowly going insane, just laying around for two and a half weeks. So the doc said on monday that I could probably do lowlevel activities. Whats a better low level thing to do than golf. I got to walk a couple miles, whack a few balls, and piss off half the people at the course by being rather loud when I hit a straight shot. It was fantastic. I cant wait until I can play a real sport.  We then went into Gettysburg to do some stuff regarding this cabin we are purchasing, then ate. Good food over there.

I ate their monday night and was thoroughly satisfied: thai tea, egg roll, coconut soup, and lemongrass beef and greens over noodles...i am drooling   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WARNING...THIS MAY OFFEND SOME READERS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Do you like Hoobastank, Evanescence, Linkin Park, Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera, Sting, Ruben Studdard, or Staind?

       On saturday we went to the house/cabin/summerhome/prettycoollittlehouse that we just bought up in Pine Grove Furnace state park/forest, which is about an hour away, heading west past Gettysburg. My dad, when he became president of gettysbug hospital, also became contractially (not spelled correctly) obligated to buy property in Adams county. And so we got a pretty sweet little cabin thing near two lakes with a volleyball court in the back yard. Its alot like the cabins you can rent at Pinchot, if you have ever seen those, except about two-three times as big.  That, my first extended public excursion since surgery, was very nice but made me extremely tired- so much so that I woke up Sunday morning and really couldnt go to church, which was a bummer.  The doc said today that I can start doing more stuff- no driving yet, and no real physical activity, but we might be able to squeeze in a short vacation. I can sit pretty long now and things are looking up. This is the first really good news i have had in a couple weeks. Yay for recovering.  The altoid gum stuff is really good. try some.  I watched the entire xgames. I am officially stoked
