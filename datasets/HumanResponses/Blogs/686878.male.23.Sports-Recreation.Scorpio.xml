          Counterpoint:  Baby seals were  made  for clubbing!  If there's one thing worth doing on this planet, it's clubbing baby seals!  Man, there isn't much I like better than taking a launch out to the icepack and then tracking down a cluster of seals.  There's nothing quite so invigorating as the crisp arctic air as you trek across the snow towards a group of seals.  And the barking?  Music to my ears.  Ah, but let's not forget the actual clubbing.  There's something about a baby harp seal staring up at you with its cute little eyes...it's like it's  begging  you to hit it with some kind of blunt object.  Who am I to deny them?  I mean, if they didn't really want you to do it, they'd do a better job of trying to escape, right?  They're just playing hard-to-get.  But the real beauty of clubbing baby seals?  Once you club one baby seal, you can use it to club  other  baby seals!  Just grab its tail and swing!  It's like that "recycling" stuff those Greenpeace people are always preaching about.  Man, I can't wait until my children are old enough to come with me; they're gonna love it.  (harp seal image from http://collections.ic.gc.ca)

          Point:   Please don't club me.  Listen, I know what you're thinking.  I can even see the dollar signs in your eyes.  But really, is it worth it?  I'm almost helpless here...and so cute and lovable.  You won't like yourself very much after you club me.  The guilt will gnaw away at you for the rest of your life.  Just think about how five years from now your daughter will see a picture of me in National Geographic and exclaim "Ooh  look , Daddy!  Isn't that adorable?  Can I have one?  Please?   Pleeeeeease ?" and you'll have to tell her, "No, dear.  Daddy brutally slaughtered them all with a wooden club."  Is it worth letting that come to pass just so some obnoxious woman with more money than she knows what to do with can wear a seal-skin coat?  I mean, what have the rich done for  you  lately?  Or perhaps you're doing it for the thrill of the hunt?  I can understand how I might appeal to you, in that case, as my kind is known the world over for its guile and cunning.  The way we gather together into large colonies?  That's just so you can have a shot of picking off even one of us as we slowly lurch away to our escape holes in the ice.  The ability to catch a single harp seal as it painstakingly undulates across the snowpack separates a true hunter from those who merely dabble.  But still, I can suggest several other options which could elevate you above even the greatest of seal-hunters - you could capture the elusive candy guarded by the ever-vigilant Baby of Doom.  Or perhaps you'd prefer the Trial of Fish in a Barrel?  So please don't club me.  I'll even be sure to have Greenpeace spraypaint me next week to take away the temptation.  Deal?

        Counterpoint:  Stop squirming, bitch!  You stupid, hag!  You deserve everything you're getting right now.  "Shouldn't have said those things to you" - you're goddamn right you shouldn't have said that crap.  I mean, I can take it if someone starts talking shit about  me , but NO ONE makes fun of my son.  Just because he wasn't born as "perfect" as you doesn't make him any less of a person, you heartless insensitive crone.  And yeah, I didn't move fast enough for you, but I'll be damned if I  ever  rush my son out of some geriatric harpy's way.  And what's this nonsense about "respect for your elders?"  How about having some respect for human life, you soul-sucking banshee?  That "puppy" you kicked was my child, you whore!  And since he looks nothing like a puppy, I must simply assume that your apology masks another vicious slight against my son's mental capabilities.  So stop squirming, you wretched excuse for a woman - you horrific waste of space and oxygen, so I can send you to the Hell you so richly deserve.

          Point:  Stop stabbing me with that knife.  Hey you, young man.  Yes, you - the one with the knife.  Would you please stop that?  Listen, I can see that you're angry about something, but did you really have to plunge that sharp piece of metal into my stomach?  Okay, I realize that I shouldn't have said those things to you, but did you really need to start slamming that knife home between my ribs?  Hey, that last one went into my lungs - could you possibly agree that perhaps you've done enough?  All right, all right, I admit that beating you over the head with my umbrella was maybe a little bit excessive, but you must understand that as an older person I am entitled to the right of way at all times (Oh come on!  That last thrust was  way  below the belt), you simply should have moved faster.  Still, I promise that I will no longer hit people with my umbrella without justification - will that satisfy you?  No?  You youths are so demanding these days.  No respect for your elders.  I just bet that you're going to keep on stabbing me with that knife, huh?  Look, had I known you felt that strongly about your puppy, I never would've kicked it in the first place.  I'm sorry.  There.  I said it.  S-O-R-R-Y.  Now would you  please  stop stabbing me?

           counterpoint:  i'm just not looking date YOU right now, or at any point.  really, i don't want to be alone right now, but you in particular are the not that guy that i'm looking to date.  sure, i like hanging out with you, and you're really funny and NICE, but i could never see myself dating you.  there's just nothing intriguing about you.  you're just you, an open book.  you just don't do it for me.  i mean, c'mon, be reasonable here.  did you honestly think that you could win me over?  oh, you did?  well, i'm sorry about that, but there's just nothing that i can do.  we're just friends, and that's all we'll ever be.  get over it, you big baby.

          Point:   I'm just not looking to date anyone right now.  i'm sorry, i'm just really tired of guys at the moment.  i need a break from...you know.  just a break.  i'm so tired of all the crap that comes with a relationship and i need some time on my own.  it's not you, i just need some time to become comfortable with  me  before i start dating again.  it's been so long since i've been on my own that i feel like i need to find myself again.  i know it's been a couple months, but breaking up with Rob took so much out of me.  i'm too emotionally drained right now to get involved with anyone and i really need some time...until i feel right again.  thank you so much for understanding - you're such a great guy.  i wish there were more guys like you out there.

        counterpoint:   bradley mitchell is the coolest guy on the planet (and an expert lover, as well)  eric, you ignoramus, you couldn't possibly be more wrong about this paragon of humanity.  just look at his knowing smile and his gorgeous flowing locks of hair - business up front, party in the back, and a long trail of heartbroken women trailing behind.  it's mouth-breathing nitwits like yourself who give respectable, intelligent, and handsome men like bradley mitchell a bad name.  i shudder to think of how wrong you'll discover yourself to be after you finally delve beyond the superficial (albeit, mightily impressive) aspects and note the incomparable presence and charisma locked into this stunning sample of what people can be if they but strive.

          point:  bradley mitchell is a dorfwang  this 'winner' is bradley mitchell, the computer networks expert at  urlLink about.com .  his hair is striking, no?  truly a dorfwang and choad to the fullest extent of the definitions of the words.  sometimes, you have to wonder what goes through the head of a guy like this when he wakes up in the morning and looks at himself in his bathroom mirror.  'wow, the ladies are gonna love me.  i'm gonna knock them dead today.  they're gonna be so impressed that i'm a computer networks expert.  heheh.  hey, where's my black trenchcoat?'  so, yeah, bradley's a dorfwang and choadblaster.  'nuff said.

        Counterpoint:  the webpage won't load, but that cannot stop me from wholeheartedly asserting that the template is an aesthetic work of the highest order.  eric lee has unparalleled depth of vision when it comes to webpage design and the simple fact that i cannot, in truth,  see  the page in no way limits my anticipatory appreciation of it.

        point:  this is the ugliest template ever.  i don't know what i was thinking.  it's just wrong in every possible aesthetic sense.  i'll change it soon, i hope, but who knows, it might stick.  and that would be horrible.

          Counterpoint:   We have the  same  moves.  Jesus, Ken.  You arrogant little jackass, we have the same freakin' moves.  At what point did you forget about "oh yeah, that Ryu guy I trained with my entire life."  Christ.  What's wrong with you?  Listen, you're not invincible.  Let E. Honda get to close, for example, and he'll bitchslap you out of the fight with that "1000 Hands" thing he does.  And what's this "fireball" and "dragon punch" nonsense?  You're not fooling anyone - everyone who sees you is going to say "oh wow, he can throw a 'hadoken'," or "oh look!  that's a 'shoryuken' there."  Translating the names into English doesn't make them "your moves."  And who the hell ever picks Ken in this game, anyway?!  C'mon!  I don't know a single damn person who chooses Ken over Ryu in Street Fighter II: Turbo.  We may have the exact same moves, but everyone seems to think I do them better for some reason.  Dorfwang.

          Point:  My fighting skills are unmatched!  I've trained long and hard and feel that I can state unequivocably that my Street Fighter II: Turbo combat skills are second-to-none.  I am undoubtedly the greatest.  No one dares go up against me because they fear my mighty arsenal of attacks.  I know some of the others think that with "just a little more training" they might possibly be able to best me, but they are the ones who simply do not wish to face reality.  My fireball, dragon punch, and hurricane kick are all superior to anything they could throw against me and I laugh at their pitiful attempts to challenge my preeminence.  My opponents must accept the fact that they will never approach the same level as my fighting ability.

          Counterpoint:    Bow before me, foolish mortals!   How  dare  you?  The sheer arrogance of your skepticism astounds me!  I, Bill Clinton, God of All shall unleash my wrath upon each and every one of you!  There shall be no mercy.  I have Spoken;  Armageddon approaches.

        Point:   Bill Clinton is not God.  Bill Clinton is not God.  He's just not.  I mean, c'mon, look at the guy!  Would any supreme being voluntarily  choose  to have pasty white thighs like that?  Granted, he appears to have strange powers, but those are all easily explained.  His sex appeal?  Women are drawn to men in positions of authority.  And they're crazy.  Most definitely crazy.  What about his ability to avoid any and all culpability?  Clever planning, that's all.  Maybe a pact with Satan, but mostly clever planning.  And his ability to capture the media spotlight at will?  Massive payoffs to journalists and cameramen.  Now, I just know that you're going to bring up that guy he brought back to life, but there was never any proof that he was dead to begin with.  And leprosy?  We don't even know what causes it, so how could we possibly say for sure that whatever Clinton did got rid of it?  Listen, I'm sick and tired of this argument.  Bill Clinton is not God, and we're all going to have to accept that.

          Counterpoint:   He's funny once you get to know him.  What are you talking about?  How can you say that Blake is "devoid of any sense of humor"?  He  totally  has a sense of humor - you just have to get to know him, that's all.  Look, I know that from the outside it seems like I'm doing the same thing I always do, but this time it's different.  Yes, he's got a six-figure job and he works out at the gym every day, but he's also incredibly funny.  Like, last night?  So picture this: he turns to me and says "you're awesome in bed, but I think your roommate gives better head."  I just started  dying  laughing.  He even said it with a straight face!  It's that kind of deadpan delivery that people simply don't understand unless they get to know a person.  Trust me, if you'd been there...well, even  you  wouldn't have been able to restrain your mirth when he followed that up with: "no, don't laugh.  I'm completely serious."  You have to be  born  with timing like that.  Trust me, once you're a little more familiar with Blake, you'll see just how funny he really is.

          Point:   I'm looking for a guy who can make me laugh.  Why do I always end up dating assholes?  I'm sick and tired of it.  I don't understand why I have such bad luck with men, but from now on I'm only going to date a guy if he has a sense of humor.  Jesus, how dumb could I have been?  Every relationship I've had has been with some good-looking guy with cash to blow.  That's my problem.  I should have seen it before - I just can't seem to use my judgment when it comes to these things.  I see an attractive, well-dressed man, and I find myself drawn to him without stopping to wonder if he's actually a  decent  guy.  Or if he can carry on a conversation.  From now on, I'm going to be less superficial.  I admit it, I've been rather shallow lately, but from this point forward that's all going to change.  I resolve that I will no longer get involved with a guy simply because he has a full bank account and a good body.  I don't care about either of those things as long as he can make me laugh.

              Counterpoint:  Yeah, you did.  You totally did.  Don't lie.  "At no point did I ever engage in sexual relations with that woman"?  Yeah, that's just a blatant lie.  Didn't your mother teach you not to lie to people?  "Baseless and unfounded" - what a load of crap!  Damnitall, why'd you have to be so damn attractive?  And let us "state for the record" that you certainly had a jolly good time with all of us.  Pig.  (Flowers pic from http://saraayers.com/gchaymes/semicelebrity.php.

          Point:  I did not have sexual relations with that woman.  My fellow Americans, I come before you today to respond to the allegations that have been made against me.  I have been accused of carrying on improper conduct within the Oval Office; conduct unbecoming of the President of the United States.  I am here to tell you that these efforts to sully my reputation are completely and utterly baseless and unfounded.  I wish to state for the record that the accusations are entirely unmerited; at no point did I ever engage in sexual relations with that woman.

           Counterpoint:  It was only a couple of flipper babies!!!  Oh God, no!  Please!  Don't do this to me!  I saw what you did to that other scientist - you wouldn't even let him keep his monkeys...  Why?  Why?  C'mon, you said that you needed another drug or the company will go under - you don't have anything else!  "Worms to ex-girlfriends?"  What kind of a drug is that???  Listen to me, the drug is ready.  I  know  we've isolated the problem this time!  Just gimme another week, I'm begging you.  You're not listening, damnit!  For the love of Christ, it was only one or two flipper babies after the last batch of drug we tested - we reduced the number by almost 90%!  Let me just talk to Don again...  That's all I'm asking.  Please?  I'm sure he'd give our funding back if he knew that almost all the flipper babies were stillborn.  You're still dragging me away!  Why aren't you listening?   It was only a couple of flipper babies!!!   (same credits as on the post below)

           Point:  That's okay, just so long as there haven't been any "flipper babies."  Listen.  We really need a drug right now to release to the public.  Okay, so there are some side-effects but, honestly, that doesn't matter - we need this drug badly enough that we'll find a way to smooth things over.  Stummies was immensely popular and got this company off the ground (Oooh, Stummies *crunch crunch*), so if you say that the drug you're working on is just like Stummies (Oooh, Stummies *crunch crunch*), we're going to run with it.  The "much bigger pill" thing?  That's sheer marketing brilliance - people always think things work better if they're larger.  I bet we could get away with charging double what we did for Stummies (Oooh, Stummies *crunch crunch*).  It boils down to this: if we don't get a drug out pronto, this company is going to be eliminated; any side-effects your drug might induce are negligible considerations...just so long as there haven't been any flipper babies.

       righty-o.  joe responded...and he took it personally!  so yeah, i've been pretty much savaged.  have fun.   Counterpoint:  My mom said Mike was a terrible lay!  I mean, my mom gets around, but she said Mike really takes the cake for being an absolutely terrible piece of ass.  Woefully inadequate.  And as much as I hate hearing about Mom's skank-tacular adventures, I especially hate it when my mom isn't satisfied because that just means she's going to be a big fat bitch for the rest of the week.  I understand that sometimes the magic just doesn't work, but she said Mike didn't even seem to try.  First, there's the size issue.  And while I've heard that fucking my mom is a "hot-dog down a hallway" type of experience, she said she was terribly disappointed.  When Mike first whipped it out, she thought he wasn't... "prepared" and decided to go "Presidential" on him to see if she could get the soldier to salute.  After she realized that she would not be re-making any "porn movie title used as a pseudonym for a Watergate informant" with Mike, she gave up.  And then there's the issue of "staying-power".  She said that all she did this little flick of her tongue and then it was "Game  Over".  They say that sexually frustrated people sometimes chew ice.  Well, she went through a whole party bag of ice.  You know, the kind you can buy at the grocery store or 7-eleven.  A whole damn bag.  Mike, if you're gonna fuck my mom, have the common decency to do it right.  I'm the one who has to suffer if Mom doesn't get her "cookies".  Anyway, if I were you, I'd get a doctor's appointment pronto to get my ass tested for nasties.

          Point:   Your mom is a really good lay.  MILF.  that's your mom.  a total milf.  i should know.  technically she's a MIAF - "mother i actually fucked," but she was so damn good i want her again, which means your mom's still a milf.  wait.  hang on, "so damn good" is a completely inadequate description, allow me to rephrase  -  damn  she was so good!  i mean, my god, the things she was willing to do.  we all thought your mom was hot, but i don't think any of us imagined just how wild she'd be in bed.  and skilled.  let's not forget skilled.  like, she did this thing with her tongue... i simply can't put words to it.  and did you know she has no gag reflex?  none!  i could go on for hours...of course, so can she if you catch my drift.  i gotta say, your mom is absolutely amazing in bed - just a great lay, man, a great lay.

        Counterpoint:  it's morally prudent(and fun) to put kittens in the blender  boy, i hope this somehow guarantees that i'll never hold public office(just playing by the rules).  anyways, it just makes sense to put kittens in the blender.  as kael pointed out, they fit perfectly.  it's like kittens and blenders were always meant for each other.  and what could be better than picking up some kittens at the shelter and taking them home to meet your blender?  and really, nothing lures sharks quite like kitten chum.  that's a proven fact, just ask steven spielberg.  and what would we do without watching 'shark week' on the discovery channel?  vote 'yes' to the pureeing of kittens.

        Point:   It's wrong to put kittens in the blender.  Just imagine - a helpless little kitten sits in your lap.  You pet it, play with it, and then cruelly and viciously grind it to death in a blender.  There's simply no call for kitten-blending in this day and age.  Just because a kitten  fits  in the blender doesn't give you the right to do it.  Kitten shakes are not meant to be consumed by the enlightened human beings of the new millenium, nor should kitten chum be allowed to lure sharks for National Geographic anymore.  I say that the time has long come when people should rise up and say "No!" to this horrific act of violence against kittens.

          Counterpoint:   Wait - You have a twin???  Oh sweet jesus.  There are  two  of you?  There is a god, and god is good.  Oh man, if only there was some way to get the two of you in bed at once, that would undoubtedly be the greatest night of my life.  Christ.  Wow.  I mean, LOOK at you, you're so unbelievably hot that I spend practically every waking minute wondering what it would be like to screw your brains out, and now I find out that there's another one of you floating around out there?  That's just not fair.  In fact, some might argue that you are morally obligated to make up for your unfairness to me in some manner...  And what's this nonsense about the "perverse fascination for an idea which amounts to nothing less than incest when you pause to examine it"?  What's so perverse about it?  I mean, have you looked at yourself lately - who  wouldn't  want twice the fun?  And the incest argument is patently unconvincing - it's not like there's any chance of inbreeding when two girls are involved.  C'mon...just talk to your sister - what'd you say her name was?  Abby?  Yeah, that was it.  Abby.  Please, I'm not asking for much.  All I want to do is strip you both naked and bang the everloving daylights out of the two of you.  Is that so much to ask?  Please...?  (image from marykateandashley.com...but it's popup hell, so don't go there.  futhermore, should anyone from the marykateandashley site come here, they just happened to be the first twins i thought of that i knew i could locate a thumbnail pic for.  the twins in the debate are hypothetical twins and not representative of any actual people.)

          Point:  The male twin-fetish is sick and demeaning.  Honestly, if I hear one more guy mention how much he'd like to get together with two twins at the same time, I'm going to scream.  It's unbelievable how often this conversation seems to spring up, though it might have something to do with the media's egregious portrayal of the issue.  Remember that Budweiser commercial where the man sings "I love football on TV, hangin' with my friends...and twins"?  Well,  I  certainly do, and let me tell you that it is  not  a pleasant memory.  And don't let me get started about Playboy and the Barbi Twins...  Speaking as a twin, I can't tell you the number of times I've made some comment to a guy about my sister Abby and watched as his eyes lit up with lust.  It's positively sickening.  I mean, how would  you  feel if I were to tell you that "oh my god, the thought of you and your brother going at it gets me sooooo hot"?  Exactly.  That's what I thought.  I may not understand the whole "guys love lesbians" thing, but I accept it.  On the other hand, I simply cannot deal with this perverse fascination for an idea which amounts to nothing less than incest when you pause to examine it.  The male twin-fetish has no place in modern society and must be eliminated.

       okay, i'm posting my matrix rant here on the counterpoint page to avoid revealing spoilers to people reading my real blog.  soooooo.....if you are here for something else - such as some flavor of 'hot mom fucking', according to the tracker - beware that  THERE ARE MATRIX RELOADED SPOILERS HERE  (nor are there 'hot mom fucking' pictures or anything).  all right, my moral obligation is out of the way now.  first off, the middle installment of trilogies is supposed to be much darker (in terms of plot) with more character interaction (or possibly development).  at least, they should be like that if they don't want to be crappy.  prime example of this conjecture: The Empire Strikes Back.  pure sequels, on the other hand, tend to be "more."  more explosions, more effects, more sex, more cars.  you know - "more".  i'd say the quintessential example of this is "Aliens" where they increased the number of aliens, the number of people fighting them, and the size of the aliens (think of the queen...) by a factor of approximately 50.  the matrix reloaded seems to have forgotten that it's the middle of a trilogy and  not  a pure sequel.  now, here are some of my observations about the movie...specifically, the things that bugged the hell out of me.  let's do it semi-chronologically.  first (and this is really minor, but a good lead-in), when mr smith delivers the envelope at the very beginning, why does neo just rip the damn thing in half down the center?  the only reason he'd open it like that would be if he already freakin' knew there wasn't a letter/note inside.  just a stupid little gaffe at the outset of the film that makes you realize that they haven't paid much attention to detail.  (and no, i don't accept that he magically sensed the earpiece inside just as he felt the arrival of mr smith).  secondly, what the hell was with that hedonistic orgy right after neo et al get back?  for one thing, it came out of nowhere.  but more importantly, was i the only person on the planet expecting the camera to pan back and to the right so that the audience all of a sudden sees "Hi!  This is Brooke Burke and welcome back to E!'s 'Wild On: Zion.'  As you can see, Zion is one of the hottest clubs in this part of the world etc etc etc."  i hope not, because it sure as hell should have happened.  and in my opinion, something really sinister should have happened to disrupt the general bacchanalia - that might have redeemed the scene (remember the whole "plot needs to be darker" theme?)  now, that's also the scene where neo starts exhibiting his extra senses in the 'real world'.  he does this several more times throughout the movie in really obvious ways...maybe you call it 'foreshadowing', but i call it 'getting hit in the head with a plot hammer'.  who the heck  isn't  expecting neo to down the probes at the end?  certainly not me.  furthermore, Mr Smith's little "i can take over people in the matrix and get translated back into their body in real life" is a blatant ripoff of the "ghost warriors" in simon green's deathstalker series.  ben might remember the ghost warriors - you know, the computer programs which took over people in the matrix and then got translated back into their bodies in real life?  hey, that sentence sounds familiar...  hmmmm.  all right, and lastly...  neo got fucking  shot in the head  in the first movie and came back to life.  trinity gets shot in the chest and neo brings her back to life...and we're supposed to be surprised?!?!?!  big fucking deal.  come back after you've been decapitated, run through a woodchipper, fed to wild animals, and then brought back to life -  then  we'll talk.  when i see it in english, i may have even more rant-worthy material, but i didn't follow all the dialogue so that's all i have for now.

          Counterpoint:   I'm a whiny bitch.  Wah!  Wah!   Waaaaaaaaaaaah!   I'm a spoiled little brat who makes every single person who watches the movie want to strangle me.  Whine whine whine.  I'm also a gigantic dorfwang who's insufferable complaining won't get any better until Return of the Jedi.  Wah!  (pic located on imdb.com.  furthermore,  luke  is the whiny bitch.  mark hamill actually seems like a pretty cool guy - i mean, you have to have respect for the guy who voiced the Joker in the animated 'batman' series.)

          Point:  But I wanted to go to Toshi Station to pick up some power converters!  Clean the droids?  But Uncle Owen, I was going to go to Toshi Station!   What do you mean, i can "waste time with my friends later"?!?  Come on, Uncle Owen - Aunt Beru  said  I could go!  Besides, if I don't get those power converters now, someone else might buy them and I won't be able to work on the landspeeder or the T-16.  You're being so unfair, Uncle Owen!  You know I've been saving up for months and who knows when they'll get in more converters at that price!?!  Listen, the 'speeder's not all that important, but if I don't install some new power converters in the T-16, I won't be able to work on my flying, which means I won't pass the admissions tests, which means that I'll  never  make it into the Academy!!!  Biggs has already been there over a year, Uncle Owen!  ...but looks like  I'm  going nowhere...

        Counterpoint:   I learned it by watching  you !  Fine, Dad, I'll tell you who got me playing this game.  You really wanna know, do you?  Well, I'll tell you then.  It was  you , Dad.  You and you alone.  Think I didn't notice all those nights you spend downstairs while Mom was alone in bed?  Think I didn't feel the tension at the breakfast table when you stumbled in with bloodshot eyes you could barely keep open against the light?  Or the wall that seemed to spring up between you and Mom?  Did you?  You wanna know about all those nights I spent watching you from the stairs as you desperately tried to get a bunker or two in place before that first zealot rush?  Or the times you cursed the comsat for not being ready fast enough?  Well I saw you, Dad.  I saw the thrill you'd get when your squads of siege tanks turned an invading zerg ground force into so much goo.  The way you'd catch your breath at the chorus of "WHA-BOOM"s they'd release.  Oh yes, Dad.  Let's not forget your glee when Brood War came out and your Goliaths suddenly had the Charon Boost upgrade.  I could feel the buzz you got when they finally had the range to compete with the Guardian squads that would inevitably menace your tanks.  The way you laughed...  Oh yes, Father dear.  I watched, all right.  And at long last, I decided that  I  wanted to feel what you felt.  That it wasn't enough simply to watch.  So I "acquired" a copy and got it running with the help of a little crack and keygen, playing a little more each day until things are as you see them now.  And it's all thanks to  you , Dearest Father.  All thanks to you.

        Point:   Where did you learn how to do this?  What are you thinking?  You want to ruin your life?  I can't believe you'd do something like this to yourself - don't you have any respect for your body?!  It can't handle this crap.  Jesus, were you doing this last night  too ?  I wanna know who got you started on this.  Who was it - huh?!?!  I walk into you're room and you've been up all night playing Starcraft.  You haven't slept - you haven't eaten - you haven't even bothered to bathe.   Two  straight nights!  Do you have ANY idea of what you're getting into?  How long has this been going on - I mean it, I want to know exactly how long you've been at it.  When did you get this disc!!!  TELL ME!!!   Who taught you how to do this???

       REVAMPED - (mostly the last couple segments)   the anti-americanism in france occassionally has me absolutely livid.  there's really nothing i can do about it except be the asskicking-est goddamn lecteur these frenchies have ever seen, but it bugs me nonetheless.  that probably at least partially explains why i put back a perfectly good book so i would have enough money to purchase the bright read "Captain America" t-shirt - might as well flaunt the fact that i'm from the US after doing my best to win them over.  "hey, he's not a bad guy and he's from the US!  they can't  all  suck..."  still, there's very little you can do here.  even when they like you, sometimes that crumbles away to nothing once they find out you're from the states.  my friend jennifer was at a bar talking with some guy.  they were chatting and getting along fairly well and eventually he asked where she was from - - - - and the amiable look and friendly demeanor melted away into this vicious snarl "i  HATE  americans!!!" and he promptly refused to have anything to do with her.  i guess that alone wouldn't bug me overmuch - i mean, there are plenty of times the US pisses me off too - but to hold every single american accountable for the actions of a small portion (government, tourists, etc)?  that's just blatant prejudice.  you're view of someone shouldn't suddenly spin 180� solely on an accident of birth.  what's worse is the gigantic hypocrisy of the sentiments.  all right, i'm perfectly willing to accept that the US is pretty darn hypocritical too when it comes to telling other countries stuff like "oh you can't burn the rainforest down; it's precious!  the very thought of all that forest burning makes tears come to my eyes as i sit here in my nice plush Gas Guzzler 5000."  but it's really fucking annoying when american music, TV, books, and movies are so eagerly sought after here while the culture that produced them is vilified.  AND it's not even like they understand the US...  actually, it makes me think of Mr. Griswold's description of the anti-masons.  "what are you?" �we're anti-masons.�  "what do the masons want?"  �we don't know - but we're against them!�   for instance, they have a sandwich in the local cafeteria called an "american".  why?  because it has mayonnaise.  it's like they think we inject it in our veins or something.  "american pizza" is so strange i can't even describe it.  burgers come with "american sauce" which is some kind of bizzare blend of ketchup, mustard, relish, mayonnaise, and coca cola.  okay, so i made the coca cola thing up, but the sauce is unlike anything i've ever encountered previously.  it goes beyond that too.  people (and not just french people) are under the impression that everyone in the US has a gun - almost as though we're issued them at birth.  i don't think i KNOW anyone who owns a gun (excluding police officers, of course).  maybe someone i know does have one and i just don't know about it.  in fact, it's probably likely - but nowhere  near  everyone.  or the flag?  riiiight - there's some kind of "children of the corn" impression they have about our flag; that we have some kind of cultish reverence for it.  first off, yes it IS a symbol and the government tries to promote it as such - but it's not like i go around saluting every american flag i see.  in fact, i doubt i've done the pledge of allegiance since 8th grade.  even before that, do you think the pledge  means  anything to a child?  it's not as though 99% of them understand what they're saying.  it's more like "hey, after i say this they let me sit down again."  however, i also admit that the american flag is much more prominent with this new wave of patriotism.  and yet, the only place i can recall seeing the flag on a t-shirt is here in france...on french people.  in regards to another relatively recent phenomenom, one of my friends was talking about people flying american flags from their cars/trucks and said something about "driving along with pointy white sheets over their heads" and that "the Klu Klux Klan is very patriotic."  i don't think he believed me when i said they were one of the most reviled groups in the country.  and perhaps they ARE patriotic...but to what nation?  i always viewed them as having secessionist views given their allegiance to the confederacy.  sure, the flag's important to them, but it's the stars and  bars  flag.  and aren't patriots supposed to uphold and safeguard the ideals of their nation?  it's really sad to find out that other countries think the US has the same ideals as the KKK.  i think i'll stop my little cathartic rant here.  see you tomorrow.  same bat-time.  same bat-channel.

      saturday, as i mentioned, was notable on account of its riots...but only to those of you who weren't lucky enough to have a spot at WaffleFest 2K3.  there's really no comparison, when you get right down to it - waffles so completely out-cool a riot that it's not even funny.  some of you recall my "i haven't gotten paid yet and i've been here almost two months" woes.  some of you may also recall that after my first paycheck, i went on an apartment-stocking binge - acquiring such luxuries as frying pans, extra silverware and plates (to complement my  a  knife,  a  fork,  a  spoon,  a  plate, etc.), a table, one of those 'bed' thingies i've heard so much about, and more.  and me being me, i made up my mind that come hell or high water (but not both at once), i was gonna buy me a waffle iron.  my reasons for doing so aren't altogether clear to me even now, but i think it mainly came down to the underappreciated "why the hell not?" rationale.  however, regardless of my motivations (or seeming lack thereof), i was prepared to defend my waffle iron's honor against the ruffians i felt certain would attempt to sully its worth with their heathen comments.  translation: i was expecting to get teased...a lot.  something strange happened, though - against all expectations, the waffle iron purchase was not mocked in the least.  in fact, it somehow captured the imagination of the lecteurs here - i almost could've started my own cult.   The Cult of Waffles!!!   mwuh hah hah hah haaaaaaaaah!   ummmm... i mean, yeah.  right, anyhoo - do any of you remember that old MST3K episode where joel reprograms the 'bots so that they love waffles so much that they pretty much create a little shrine out of waffles and start worshipping?  yeah, that was patrick here.  Waffle Party!!  because of course we have nothing better to do at 8 pm on a saturday...  well, i know  i  don't.  so first thing, it looks to be about 5 people or so - and we figure out who's bringing what (a true waffle party needs a variety of toppings, after all): syrup, powdered sugar, butter, strawberries, ice cream, and - at my suggestion -...nutella.  a couple days later, yann tells me that "it's gathering steam".  we've hit double digits of people - with only one waffle iron (and each waffle takes approximately 4 minutes to cook).  we actually debated buying another waffle iron, but by some stroke of luck we ran into someone who had one of her own.  couple drawbacks: it was smaller...and made waffles in the shape of Cute Little Hearts, but waffles nonetheless.  WaffleMania arrives and we're all set and ready to go at yann's place...until yann realizes that we are severely lacking in one area - those "plates" that i've heard so much talk about.  it being 8:10 and the only chance of getting paper plates closing at 8:30, i made a dash for the metro - - - and got SCREWED by the riot.  freakin' shut down the metro.  bastards.  we ended up decreeing that the people using ice cream would have to eat their waffles out of bowls (the only other choice was frying pans).  mmmmmm....waffles.  i took waffle-making duties upon myself (though i declined generous offers by others to take over), and kept popping out waffles to people probably for about an hour or so.  took the last three for myself and plunked down.  good times.  good times.  grocery shopping beckons, but i'll be back tomorrow with either a radio rant or a random slew of non-french stuff.  much shorter - More Rant, Less Plot.

      given that ben's request was, in my humble - but correct - opinion, completely bloody insane, i've decided to indulge colin's request and talk about his politically-minded counterparts over here in New Gaul (or as the New Gaulians call it, 'France'.)     Not-so-generic Protesters  (credits to theonion.com, of course)  all right - around 9 on saturday morning (sacrilege, i know) i got up and headed out to do laundry.  when i got to the square near my apartment, i saw a whole crapload of things that looked like bigger versions of the old VW bus - all parked along the side of the road, and every single one of them filled with police.  still, they weren't  doing  anything, so i just passed on through the little square and went off to do my laundry.  as the day went by, the highly effective french forces continued to sit on their collective ass in Place de Bretagne - for no apparent reason.  come evening, i found out why they were all there....it turns out that they were just a small portion of the police presence and that the rest of them were all clustered around the really busy square/intersection (R�publique).  there simply wasn't enough room.  word had gotten out that there was going to be some kind of big demonstration that night and the city had called out just about every officer available.  not that i realized this at the time - i was just walking to the metro so i could make it to the waffle party (that'll be tomorrow's blog) - had the damndest time wondering why the hell all the police were there.  unfortunately, whoever organized the demonstration ran into a little problem...  namely, another demonstration.  oh yes, my friends, there were two simultaneous and unrelated protests scheduled for the same time and the same place.  one of them came for a sort of continual background beef the french have been muttering about for some time - war in iraq.  the other is a relatively newer testiness engendered by the installation of video cameras to help cut back on crime.  "police everwhere, justice nowhere!" was a favorite slogan on the posters i saw the next day.  so anyway, just like two weather fronts colliding, the one protest met the other protest and Things Happened.  RIOT!!!!!  they smashed a bus shelter, knocked over some chain link fences, generally ran amok, and went after the police.  now, the same people upset about the cameras also had a problem with alleged 'police brutality'...which meant that the police there were treating the rioters with kid gloves.  my friend patrick saw the demonstrators knock an officer off his motorcycle as he was riding along - they then proceeded to beat the crap out of the motorcycle, bashing in its flashing lights and keeping at it until the siren finally gave out.  in the words of patrick "you would  never  see something like that in the states.  anyone who tried would get fucking  beat. down. "  i'm not totally sure what happened beyond that.  patrick says he saw tear gas at one point, but that it was "wussy tear gas.  probably not even tear gas, anyway."  R�publique was completely empty of people when ben and i walked back from the waffle party.  lots of trash, but no people.  kinda spooky, actually.  man...it's all Clinton's fault.    The Evil Plan  (again, thanks to theonion.com)

      i forgot one saving grace about the doughnuts here - unfortunately, it doesn't make any difference for  me , but i realize that to some of you nutella is like an unholy combination of crack and heroin...so if you want a fresh nutella doughnut, you better mosey on over to france.  now, on to the REAL topic of the day: my increasing nuttiness.  it's like my idiosyncrasies have been breeding and spawning brand new quirks ever since i arrived in france.  for instance, i never used to talk to myself before - not that i carry on conversations with myself or anything, but i appear to be awfully fond of keeping up a running commentary in regards to what i'm about to do.  common statements include "now i just gotta..." or "okay, i'm done with that so i'll move on to..." or even the classic "who am i talking too?"  and the  really  sad thing is that that last one happens on a regular basis.  you'd think i'd catch myself and go "wow!  i REALLY need to stop talking to myself", but you'd be wrong!  not like i'm having arguments with myself...yet.  on the other hand, i AM dealing out cribbage hands and playing both sides of the game.  granted, i'm not pegging, but i'm tallying up all the hand totals and keeping track of scores.  not that i have a cribbage board, which would be infinitely cooler.  still, it's Mike Anderson vs. Mike Anderson in an all out battle for Mike Anderson dominion!  and a 21 point hand, to boot.  fun for the whole family.  and let's not forget the frisbee, eh?  i need a fix so fucking hardcore... i mean, it was bad when i started keeping the disc in my bag at all times "just in case", but now i walk around tossing it up in the air so i can catch it without breaking stride.  it's kinda like a particularly stupid yo-yo.  i don't know if maybe i hope someone will see me doing it and make a cut while calling for the disc, but the day can't be that far away when i just start wingin' the frisbee at people and seeing how they react.  can they come up with some kind of frisbee drug that i could inject into my veins?  i think the world would be a better place.  i'd be happy with a frisbee video game, though.  is that too much to ask?  is it?  shigeru miyamoto, can you hear me?  i'll ask louder... WOULD YOU PLEASE MAKE A FRISBEE GAME FOR THE GAMECUBE ?

      doughnuts - they don't exist here in france.  okay, so you can get something called "beignets", which are like those powdered doughnuts you can get in the states (usually filled with strawberry or lemon filling or somesuch), but you can't find a plain old glazed doughnut - and certainly nothing that approaches the sheer utter melt-in-your-mouth joy of a hot krispy kreme.  even those "beignets" just don't compare.  for example, i bought a "beignet fraises"...and it was just the powdered doughnut cut in half, spread over with strawberry jam, and then closed like a sandwich.  amazingly disappointing.  the apple ones have pure apples diced up and injected inside, instead of the somewhat sweeter version in the states.  and don't get me started about the chocolate doughnuts.  actually, i'm going to subject you to it anyway.  so i buy this thing called a "beignet chocolat", and think to myself that "self, i don't like chocolate, but chocolate doughnuts have chocolate creme or chocolate frosting or something sufficiently non-chocolatey that i kinda like 'em."  of course, then i proceed to take a big ol' bite out of the beignet and discover - to my horror - that it's filled with pure unadulterated chocolate.  not that it was like a hershey bar or anything, so at least there wasn't a solid core to the doughnut, but it was like having a mouthful of hershey's chocolate syrup (with a bit more consistency).  more tomorrow, but i'll leave you with a picture of my dulcimer playing alter-ego. "Mike plays guitar, banjo, jaw harp, noseflute, bones, and more. He is best known as an outstanding mountain dulcimer player - one of the very best in the state and indeed the entire Midwest."

      i was going to stop at one blog for the day, but then yann and i practically got cavity-searched by security at carrefour.  we walk through the sensors and then get immediately called over by Agent Officious Bastard, Carrefour Security.  he searches through our bags and then makes some call on his walkie-talkie, then asks us a question... of course, Agent O. Bastard opted not to take the walkie-talkie away from his mouth, so we both assumed he was still talking to some other security dude.  so instead of lowering the walkie-talkie and making it clear that he was addressing the two of us, he instead snidely asks us if we speak french.  us:  "yes, we do."  O.B.:  "we have a policy against bags here."  us:  "really?  we've always worn them before..."  O.B.:  "is that so?  i take it you don't come here often."  us:  "no - many times.  at least once a week and there's never been a problem before."  O.B.:  "fine.  just be prepared to show us the contents of you bags at the checkout." (makes some comment over walkie-talkie about "two guys with large backpacks" as we walk away)  not that i've  ever  seen them stop a woman walking in with a purse large enough to hold a small african nation.  nooooooo....  and no, they didn't search our bags at the checkout, but they did have 2 security guards hover like vultures.  what really sucks is that we were probably fantastic decoys for real shoplifters.

      okay, so france appears to be the anti-shoplifting center of the universe.  it's ludicrous the lengths they go to in order to prevent people from making off with things from their store.  first off, even my  grocery  store has some sort of bouncer-type on duty at all times (they employ several so that there's one on duty at all times).  when you walk in, he stares at you forbiddingly with his arms crossed...when he's not prowling the aisles watching all the customers like a hawk.  and usually, one of the managers is ALSO making the rounds through the store.  and this is at the freakin' grocery store.  every store i go to has some kind of setup so that you can't get out the way you came in - or at the very least, those electronic sensors that look like metal detectors.  "but most shops in the u.s. have those!" you say.  true, but that's the  minimal  security measure in france.  a large number of places have gates that only open inwards, or even turnstiles.  to get out, you often HAVE to go through the cash registers...even though the storeowners frequently neglect to provide easy access through the register aisles for those without any purchases.  a couple times, i've had to wait in line to get out...even though i wasn't buying a damn thing.  and there's one place called "carrefour" which is a lot like walmart...if walmart was completely and utterly psychotic.  1) no fewer than 3 "bouncers" at the entrance and oft-times more.  2) electronic sensors at that same entrance.  3) people who roam the store and watch the customers.  4) electronic tags on the  hand-baskets  so you can't steal the stupid plastic pieces of crap.  5) yet ANOTHER set of sensors at every checkout aisle.  6) occasional bag-checks after you've made your purchases.  6) i'm sure there are cameras.  the money they save by preventing shoplifting can't possibly match the amount they spend to do so.  maybe it's a paranoia thing...which might explain the old women around here.  okay, somehow in a country of 60 million people, there are roughly eleventy billion 80-year-old women who  might  reach 4 feet tall on a good day.  they walk around and body check people out of their way while rolling their little handcarts behind them.  they won't try to maneuver these carts around any obstacles either.  they will - without hesitation - roll them right over your foot.  maybe saying "body check" wasn't quite right, but there's absolutely no consideration whatsoever.  not even the mutual "both parties turn sideways so they can pass without hitting each other."  it's even worse on the bus, because they'll put their stupid little handbags on the seats next to them to prevent anyone from sitting in their "personal space."  it doesn't matter if every other seat is full and people are standing packed in like sardines.  nooooooo - their handbag needs a seat.  it reminds me of the old women at the casino who sit in front of one slot, put their bag in front of the slot machine on their left, then put their leg up on the seat to their right...and gamble in three machines at once.  they're just way too paranoid about people getting close to them, i guess.  one of the other lecteurs here spent a year in Tours, and described how the old women would sit in their apartments with the blinds mostly shut and watch people with binoculars as they passed by in the streets.  it's so spooky here - i mean, i thought the attitude of older people towards the younger was wary in the states, but it's about 300 times more so here in france.  riiiight, doughnuts just don't mix with the previous two topics.  i'll save that for another day.

      here are a few things that mystify me about france.  first and possibly foremost - the pizza places.  pizza should be available at all hours of the day, yes?  i mean, you know those times at 2 in the morning when you all of a sudden get a craving for papa john's?  well, you're s.o.l. in france.  in fact, you're s.o.l. at freakin' 4 pm.  that's right, pizza joints in france have the absolutely asinine hours of 11-2 and then 6-11.  isn't pizza, by definition, supposed to be available even after practically everything else is closed?  some might say ESPECIALLY after everything else has closed.  and it's ridiculously expensive - something like papa johns' hawaiian pizza will run you over 20 dollars/euros for a large (assuming s/m/l sizes).  keep in mind that the mediums can easily be demolished by someone with even a marginal appetite.  at least they run you offers that if you order one pizza takeout, they'll give you a second one of same or lesser price free.  of course, they have to be the same SIZE too, which sucks.  so if you order a medium "country" pizza for 15-odd euros, they won't let you get a large cheese pizza for free, even though it only costs 13.50.  you have to get the medium cheese pizza instead - bastards.  then there are the one way streets.  the french seem to have this opinion that it doesn't matter which direction you're traveling on a one-way street, so long as you're  pointed  in the right direction.  every single day, i see people zippin' down the wrong way on one-way streets...in reverse.  i don't understand why they seem to think that having the front of the car pointed in the proper direction means they are obeying the traffic laws.  makes no sense to me...  and let's not forget the fun of trying to figure out how to pronounce the french products that have english names.  the entire menu at Quick (think 'mcdonalds') is in english.  "je voudrais les 'cheek-enn noug-ets'."  and then they look at you like you're insane, even though it says "chicken nuggets" on the board and the LAST time you came in, you asked for "chicken nuggets"...and they looked at you like you were insane.  i don't even want to try asking for the "Big 'n' Tasty" - adding apostrophes is just a recipe for disaster.  same problem with movie titles.  should you ask to see "Mee-noh-ree-tee Reh-pohr" instead of minority report?  either way, they can't seem to understand what movie you want.  incredibly frustrating.  if you're going to write a product name in english, at least put forth some modicum of effort to pronounce it properly.  it's more difficult than you'd expect trying to fake a good "french person speaking english" accent.  consider whatever problems you may have had doing a decent french accent in  french  and then do that while countering the way you automatically pronounce your native language.  it's LOADS of fun!  back tomorrow with tales of doughnuts, paranoid 3 foot tall old women, and the anti-shoplifting psychosis here.

      since i can't access the internet tomorrow, i'll do my best to write a healthy french-related blog today.  right - so the french grading system?  much less lenient than in the states.  now, most of you already knew that, but let me elaborate a little bit.  first off, the grading scale goes from 0 to 20 with 20 being the highest possible grade.  i use "possible" rather loosely, since they give those out every other blue moon.  secondly, a 10/20 is considered passing...but then they basically do a bell curve around a 10, so approximately 1/2 the class ends up failing.  okay, maybe not that bad, but at least 40% do.  you'll hear things like "she's   well above average.  12?"  ANNNNNNND, the professors grading the students on their pronunciation say that british/irish/american/etc accents are all okay, but then the hypocritical bastards get all snooty about how "only british english is acceptable."  not all of them, but some of them.  one of them gave a  native speaker  a 17/20...and the lecteur had to fight to get it that high.  in another class, a canadian girl pronounced 2 words differently than the american lecteur (and the british professor) out of an entire long passage...and got dropped to an 18 (again, despite vigorous complaints by the lecteur).  why CLAIM that there are several acceptable accents but then be so disparaging about anything non-british?  ooh!  ooh!  and the fact that the test for second year students was completely and utterly different than any of the labs they'd done throughout the entire semester?  yeah, that was total crap, huh.  all semester they get to listen to a pre-recorded passage, which they then repeat sentence by sentence.  in the exam, they were handed a piece of paper and told to read it onto the tape...without ever getting to listen to it.  how are they supposed to magically guess how to pronounce "acetylene"?  that's just plain cruel.  of course, there's this weird thing where they can miserably fail their english class, but if they get an 18/20 in swimming (yes, they CAN take sports for a grade) then they get credit for the english class.  i'll try to explain this on monday.  i'll also try to post that picture of bearded-mike, if the stupid NT computers here would freakin' let me upload (or even attach files via email).

      here's my summary for the first 360 pages of robert jordan's "crossroads of twilight" (i've only read 360 pages thus far, but the recap may hold true for the entire rest of the novel):  "Meanwhile, back at the ranch..."  it's like "ender's shadow" was to "ender's game", taking place over the exact same period of time but from a different (in this case, several different) perspective.  every time the book reaches the last day from "winter's heart", robert jordan abruptly cuts off whatever character he happens to be on and shifts over to a new focus.   MINI-SPOILERS  (and blatant theft of eric's "hi, my name is so-and-so" theme):  "Hi, my name's Mat Cauthon!  I'm still stuck near the Seanchan and still dealing with the Daughter of the Nine Moons!"  blah blah blah, time passes.  "Huh?  You say that someone is using a crapload of the One Power?  But who possibly-"  Meanwhile, back at the ranch...   "Hi, my name's Perrin Aybara/Goldeneyes!  I'm still chasing after my wife who got captured by the Shaido!"  blah blah blah, time passes.  "What's going on?  Why is everyone who can Channel staring way off into the west like that?  I'm confused, what's going-"   Meanwhile, back at the ranch...   "Hi, my name's Faile Bashere t'Aybara!  I'm still a captured gai'shan in the Shaido camp!"  blah blah blah, time passes.  "Wow, all the wise ones who can Channel sure look perturbed by something out west.  What's up with-"   Meanwhile, back at the ranch...   "Hi, my name's Elayne Trakand!  I'm still fighting to get my throne at Caemlyn!"  blah blah blah, time passes.  "OH LIGHT!  Who could possibly be using that much power!?!?!  Oh no!  Rand is there too!  I wish I knew what was happ-"   Meanwhile, back at the ranch...   and that's just in 360 pages and omitting a couple "Meanwhile, back at the ranch"'s.  and yes, i AM a colossal nerd.

      DONE WITH FIRST SEMESTER!!!  one more semester to go, and almost three weeks of break before i kick it off.  all i gotta say is that my oral expression kids better freakin' talk next semester.  it's rather infuriating sitting there deliberately leaving awkward silences in the hopes that someone will feel compelled to fill it...especially since no one ever does.  eventually, i stop pausing and keep right on ramblin'.  i really don't think i want another semester where every oral expression class turns into the Mike Comedy Hour.  besides, if they don't talk i won't get to hear the hysterical mixups they make.  no more "i do not want, ummmmmmm, children because i am, er, too tight."

      fun with the french!  my friend yann has been waiting for his "carte de s�jour" for months - a handy-dandy little card that lets him get paid by the personnel department here at UHB.  on friday, he goes to the pr�fecture and asks if his card is ready.  they inform him that no, it is not, but it will be finished by the end of the month.  yann leaves disappointed and comes back two hours later to renew his temporary card...at which point a different person behind the desk happily supplies him with his brand-new carte de s�jour which has been ready since early december.  go figure...

      my posts thus far have been almost uncannily similar to my former away messages.  unfortunately, it's just a painful reminder of how i don't have instant messenger anymore - the computers here at the school don't have it installed, nor can you download it and do it yourself.  maybe someone smarter than i could figure out how to get around the administration here and install it anyway, but sadly i'm not smarter than myself.  even worse, i can't access aol quickbuddy, denying me even THAT altogether sucky and unsatisfying replacement.  now, before y'all start going off about "addict!"-this and "you just need your fix!"-that, i have some fairly practical reasons for this.  first off, take the time difference.  often, i'm in bed asleep before you people are even out of work/class for the day.  it puts a definite cramp on my ability to call people.  this leaves emails, which simply don't flow the same way as phone calls or IM.  the latter give you a nice give-and-take conversation where you can feel where things are going and have a good idea of what's catching the interest of the other person.  emails and letters are just a one-sided proffering of information that you think the other person MIGHT like to hear and which don't reach the other person until after an unknown delay.  with IM, you know who is or is NOT available at any time.  i would almost never call anyone in the states pre-11 a.m., and yet if i saw them on IM, there's nothing to prevent me from striking up a conversation.  this effectively counters the time difference problem.  secondly, there's less flexibility.  for the most part, phone calls limit you to one person/conversation at a time, whereas with IM you can simultaneously carry on 2 high quality conversations, 3 good conversations, 4 decent ones, or more (depending on your typing skill and ability to keep multiple conversation threads going in your brain).  furthermore, IM allows for "dead zone" periods, where neither party has something immediate to offer, nor do they feel obliged to add something simply to avert an awkward silence.  and lastly, of course, is the price.  IM from the school: free.  Phone calls to the states: 6.5 cents a minute.  admittedly, the price isn't that bad, but i find a rack up a looooooot of minutes.  so i guess the short of it is that i'm really making an effort to keep in touch with everyone from home, but if i had instant messenger i could be doing so much better.

S.O.S.!!!  BONNE ANNEE 2003!!!"  help!  s.o.s.!  happy new year!   ummmmmm....transition?

      a tidbit for any of you who ever decide they want to visit france: if you find yourself craving a Milky Way while you're here, go pick up a Mars Bar.  DO NOT, on the other hand, buy a Milky Way.  Mars Bars here are deliciously misnomered Milky Ways.  Milky Ways, on the other (and much less satisfying) hand, are filled with some strange white nougat-like substance..and no caramel.  no caramel!!!  sacrilege!  on the plus side, coca cola is made with sugar and not corn syrup.  sacrilicious...

      by the way....FRANCE IS ON SALE!!!  that's right, folks.  pretty much everything is on sale here in the land of groundskeeper willy's "cheese-eatin' surrender-monkeys."  it's a post-christmas blowout to the extreme and i've never seen anything like it.  granted, books are still sky-high, but amazon.fr has made a compelling case for me to buy my books off of their site.  reasons: 1.  "livres en anglais".  a full section devoted to them and probably linked with the main amazon site in the u.s.  no longer shall i be scraping the bottom of the barrel and lowering my standards just so i can read something in my native language. 2.  price.  books here are freakin' 11-13 bucks a pop for paperbacks and what they charge for hardcover books is simply unconscionable.  and all the bookstores nearby import books from the UK, which charges the same number value as in the states....in pounds.  amazon.fr for some reason lets me choose books from the u.s. and gets them over here for 7 bucks apiece. 3.  delivery.  a bit of a combo of 1 and 2.  i don't have to scour the local bookstores anymore and if i order more than 20 euros worth of stuff, shipping is free.  now, for those of you who know me, you realize that i can ALWAYS find 20 dollars in books to read.  (the euro is so close to the dollar that i can't be bothered distinguishing between the two.)  and did i mention france is on sale?  the only way this could get better is if monkeys were somehow involved.

      someone took my blue hooded sweatshirt back in november...  i folded up the sweater then placed it neatly under a table in the computer room.  i then folded up my jacket and put it on top of the sweatshirt.  when i returned in the afternoon, the sweatshirt was gone.  wtf?  it was UNDER the jacket - a much nicer jacket, i might add - and yet the jacket was left behind and the sweatshirt taken.  today (over two months later), i walk into the computer room and run across the magical disappearing/reappearing sweatshirt - not-so-neatly folded and placed in exactly the same position under the table.  who the hell would take a ratty ten-year-old sweatshirt for two months and then decide to bring it back?  on another note, no classes next thursday...2 fewer hours of class in the making.  still the same amount of money.  rock.

      it's a blogfest today!!!  so i get back from break and have one week of half-assed classes to teach before yet another(!) break.  why half-assed, you ask?  because the students have already HAD their exams.  that's right, all you little geniuses out there - they have their final exam, then go on a two week break...then come back for more.  frankly, i'm completely flabbergasted that any of them bothered to show up this week at all, especially since the grades for the semester have already been determined.  so i'm cancelling all these nonsense classes for next week, which gives them some extra time to prepare for their other exams (there's an official "exam week" for all non-lab classes).  actually, the part about "more time to prepare" is total crap; i'm cancelling them because they're completely pointless.  translation:  i have almost an entire month where i'm expected to do absolutely nothing.  in fact, from december 20th until february 4th, i will work precisely six - count 'em! - SIX days.  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand, since i'm cancelling 9 classes for next week, i'll only teach 19 hours in that time.  and who am i kidding?  i already cut my 5 hour day today down to a whopping 3 hours of actual work.  that 19 hours looks a whole lot more like 12 right now.  sooooo - one month.  12 hours.  1200 dollars.  good deal.

      is there any situation that cannot be improved (or at the very least, made funnier) by the addition of more monkeys?  secondly, it appears that PETA is about to boycott KFC.  what i'd like to know is if they take action based on past acts of cruelty.  i mean, does ozzy osbourne still get crap from them today for biting the head off that dove?

      Why are women always cold? I don't get it. I mean, they're smaller, so they have less volume to heat. They get that layer of adipose in their teens, so they're better insulated. And, well, I can't think of anything else right now, but I'm sure there's an "and." Is it poor circulation or something?  Disclaimer:  I know it's not every woman, it just appears to be true of a rather high percentage.  Moreover, it's not a value judgement - merely curiosity about a question I can't seem to answer.

      Right, so since I'm in Bretagne (the city of Rennes, to be precise), there's all these references to Arthurian legends. For instance, near the grocery store I shop at, there's the "Square du roi Arthur," or "King Arthur's Square." It's more of a courtyard in between a few high-rise apartment buildings than anything else, but it's nice to think big I guess. However, given that I'm from CT, that I love the BoSox, and that I'm living in a city with places like the aforementioned square, I could be "A Connecticut Yankee-Hater in King Arthur's Courtyard." I don't know why that amuses me, but it does.

      ahhhh, oral expression classes - such a source of amusement (sprinkled intermittently amidst interminable agony of boredom).  i've already mentioned a few events, but here are a couple recent ones:  student: "the women were beaten with wisps" me: "i think you mean 'whips'..."   me: "what do you think about cloning organs?" student: "yeah, i think it's great!  you can smoke all you want, and then when your lung is dead you can get another one!"   and then there are expos�s where people give little 5-minute talks in english on a topic of their choice.  the two worst ones: one student walked up to the front of the room, wrote some vocab on the board, then sat down and read an article from a magazine.  i stopped him a couple paragraphs in once i finally realized he had nothing of his OWN to say.  then i made him cite his source and taught the class the word "plagiarism".  the other one sat down and gave me pretty much an encyclopedia entry for Senegal.  "its population is blah.  its average temperature is blah.  its main industry is blah."  basically, it was a "where i went on my summer vacation" speech after i specifically told them NOT to do one of those under any circumstances.  on the plus side, you get to teach them whatever vocab you want.  "to bogart, as in 'hey, stop bogarting the cheese'."  or "have you ever seen the phrase 'knocked up'?"  okay - come on back tomorrow for the second installment of point/counterpoint (what mike didn't know at the time is that tomorrow might be the first point/counterpoint and i emphasize the might because who knows if it'll even happen. -e)

      it's weird, but being in france has turned me into a total eavesdropper.  it's bad enough if the person is speaking in france.  i end up listening because i want to see if i can understand what they're saying.  it's really difficult and i think it might help my french, since it means i have to figure out what's going on in spite of background noise, slang, speed, and the slurring that comes into play when someone talks to a friend.  it's still damnably difficult, but it's getting easier...  on the other hand, if the person's speaking english, you end up doing your best "i can't wait to get off this metro" blank stare and try as hard as you can to hide the fact that you're listening intently.  you get this little thrill out of feeling like you're in on a secret that you weren't intended to know.  sometimes you feel like jumping in on the conversation just to see the reaction on their faces when they discover they've been talking in front of a native speaker.  at other times you struggle not to laugh...  i don't know how i would've held back if what happened to ben had happened to me.  Ben:  (gets on bus, followed by a few american girls who are chatting it up and stand right the hell in front of him) Girl One:  blah blah blah Girl Two:  blah BLAH blah blah Girl One:  blah blah.  you like him, don't you? Girl Two:  no! Girl One:  yes you do!  you wanna hump him. Girl Two:  hey!  quiet... Girl One:  what?!  it's not like anyone can understand me!  (singing) you wanna hump him. you wanna hump him." Ben:  (desperately trying not to laugh)  good times.  good times.

      there's a giant store here on the order of walmart called "carrefour."  think of walmart...now take away about 1/2 the toys, rearrange the store every week so you can't find anything, take away 1/2 the clothes, ADD a fairly large supermarket, and then top it off with a buttload of alcohol.  that's carrefour.  it's pretty much the only thing that stays open after 8pm.  it's open until  9:30  - wow! (dripping with sarcasm).  it's housed in this gigantic warehouse-type building, kinda like BJ's, Sam's Club, and Walmart.  here's the thing though, if you listen...you can hear a positive flock of birds.  looking up at the ceiling, you'll see tons of nests built in the rafters.  i really don't understand what the french health code must be that this doesn't violate it about eleventy billion times.   especially  after i watched a bird hop across the racks of fresh-baked pastries, picking at whatever it felt like eating.  unbelievable.

      so i always preferred cats to dogs, but the time in rennes has really cemented that choice.  it's gone from disinterest in dogs to actual antipathy for them.  part of the problem is that there's no law requiring people to clean up after their pets - and who's going to walk around with a little plastic baggie on their hand if they don't have to?  you learn very quickly to always scan the ground near your feet as you walk along.  there's dog crap almost  everywhere ...and this city is supposedly one of the "cleanest" in that respect.  secondly, 99% of these dogs are stupid little teacup-sized foo-foo dogs (who seem to produce an extraordinary amount of crap given their relative lack of stature).  i've seen bigger chipmunks in my back yard than these ridiculous excuses for canines.  so damn annoying.    thirdly, these people bring their dogs everywhere they go, practically without reservation.  they even bring them onto the metro and into the malls.  i can't tell you how fun it is to see a stupid white poodle decide to mark its territory on an escalator you were about to use.  and lastly, to be perfectly honest, i lied about the 99% thing.  there's a significant number of actual "dogs".  creatures that wouldn't be ashamed to bear that name in the u.s.  however, the mangy things belong to the professional homeless kids here (the "Underground").  so whenever you see a dog of anything approaching a normal size, you know you're going to be hit up for money in approximately three seconds.  it wouldn't be so irritating except that these kids are  not , in fact, truly homeless.  they just decide to live on the streets, preach anarchy, and be general pains-in-the-ass.  maybe i'll tackle these people later, but as it is, this post is starting to run a little long.  besides, how could you not like cats after reading  urlLink get fuzzy ?

      i think eric lee's onto something here.  the other night on the phone (in the "what the hell did you expect" tone of voice)   eric: "there's always an evil twin".  that's right, every single one of you has someone who looks exactly like you running around wreaking havoc.  and what if someone's  already  evil?  does their counterpart become the "Evil er  Twin"?  there's so much potential here...

      ah yes, friday.  or as everyone else calls it: "the day before Point/Counterpoint."  perhaps it'll be scholarly, perhaps it'll be something out of the jerry springer show - who knows?  i don't.  i don't even know if colin and joe worked out a set of rules for it (although i sent a very rough outline of potential guidelines to them a few days ago).  in honor of the forthcoming debates, here's a link to theonion.com's archived  urlLink point/counterpoints .  i don't know who's going to start on saturday.  colin, joe - you could do rock/paper/scissors...  or just decide on your own.  (rock/paper/scissors?  but how? if you both had eric's address, you could email him a list of 10 choices or so.  then he'd compare the choices - first to win two gets to pick when they want to go.)  let the games begin!   ummmmmm....begin tomorrow!

      ohhhhhhhhh my.  the professors here record audio clips off the internet and put them onto tapes for their students.  now, amongst all the clips from the BBC, New Zealand National Radio, and NPR, i suddenly hear a familiar voice...Steven Carell from "The Daily Show" doing one of their fake news segments.  it's as if they handed out a slew of newspapers and then unwittingly included an issue of The Onion.

      last-second updates:  it's "snowing" right now, but if my parents saw it they'd say "oh good, it's finally stopped snowing" given the gigunda snowstorm they just went through.  as i mentioned before, the department scheduled a grammar class during my second-year language labs - effectively forcing the kiddies to be in two places at once; a task they simply aren't up to tackling.  the solution?  to reschedule the class such that i teach it the next day instead...while i'm otherwise occupied teaching my oral expression class.  soooooo, the solution for the kids having to be in two places at once is for the teacher to be in two places at once.  okay, so i pulled it off as a student (i am just way too proud of that particular feat), but i simply can't do it as a teacher.  i can't simply employ the strategy of "never showing up" like i did in college.  gah.

      there's really very little funnier than watching two french kids get onto the metro with rolled up posters who then proceed to yell at each other through the tubes: "we are the kna-eeeeghts who say-eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee........'nee'!"  which, amazingly enough, was followed minutes later by the two people next to them attempting to sing "lucy in the sky with diamonds".  (take THAT, shatner!)  i almost don't feel jealous of patrick and anna anymore, who got to watch a group of drunken french kids singing along to nirvana's "rape me".

      today was rather eventful in the "only in france" department...  first off, i got my phone bill, which broke down as follows: local calls - 6h52m    fee - 10.11 calls to cell phones - 50m     fee - 10.22 (note to self: don't call cell phones.)  then i got on a bus where the driver seems to have watched a few too many episodes of "speed racer" lately - either that or he was practicing for his future career as a stunt driver.  of course, while we were whipping by the various sights, i managed to catch a fleeting glimpse of a mcdonalds ad on the side of a bus shelter - an ad in which there's a father in 1950's-style attire looking down as his son points at two little white poodles...poodles that are in the process of humping away at each other.  and the caption?  "on t'expliquera chez McDo" - 'one will explain it to you at mcdonalds'.  and yes, they abbreviate mcdonalds as 'McDo'.  where do kids go to learn the facts of life in france - mcdonalds!  and i've got to say that my students were absolutely useless when i asked them how they'd say 'waddup' in french.  i mean, even after i explained it to them about 8 times, then wrote "waddup = what's up = hey, how are you" - nothing.  grah.

      right - allow me to say something deliberately positive, lest people think that i'm having an awful time here or something.  rennes has GREAT public transportation.  i'm seriously impressed on a regular basis with the quality mass transit here.  there are at least a dozen different bus lines (and i think it's more like 2 dozen) that run all over the local area, there's a brand spankin' new metro here which rarely breaks down (in spite of yann's insistence that it does so every time it rains), there are racks of bikes that people can rent for the day, and if you've got a little farther to travel there's a bigass train station serving all your TGV needs.  i also appreciate the "carte campus" they offer, which allows students to get unlimited transport on both metros and buses/busses between nov. 1st and may 31st for 129 euros.  man does that thing come in handy...  on another note, i'm debating turning sunday's into "point/counterpoint" � la old-school SNL - between my republican friend joe and my hippie friend colin.  not that i've asked joe, but he might be interested - especially if i offered him the dan akroyd role.  Colin:  (liberal hippie-speech) Joe:  "colin, you ignorant slut!  i guess dried-up, dirty hippies like you never learned the finer points of using their brain.  (and so on and so forth)"

      Surprise guest blog!  Bet you didn't think I was gonna come through and blog for Whitey today.  I just wanted to talk about how much fun snow is.  See, it started snowing in DC last night, which is where I was, and it kept snowing all the way through today.  I was supposed to catch an 11:25 train from DC to Philly, except, thanks to the snow, I didn't get to hop on a train until 3:50 or so.  Much thanks to Annie for being home when I called and making the wait actually fun.  It then took about 3.5 hours to get from DC to Philly, when it normally takes 1.5 to 2.  But the real fun (and there is NO sarcasm there, I swear) was when I drove home from Villanova to King of Prussia.  There was about 1.5 to 2 feet of snow on the ground, and about half that height on the roads (because there's only about 2 plows in eastern PA).  It was so much fun driving through that, with controlled (and uncontrolled) fish tails all over the place, skidding, and just plain fun.  And laughing at people in 4 wheel drive SUVs going 5 miles an hour.  Fools.  One of the coolest things was seeing my speedometer get up to 40 as I went up a hill, when my actual speed was between 10 and 15 mph.  It's too bad they cancelled classes tomorrow, because I'm really starting to love driving in the snow.  Ah well, c'est la vie.

      prices here - some good, some bad, some just plain strange.  first off, some clothes are dirt cheap, but others are expensive beyond all reason.  most of the ludicrously expensive ones are brands that are popular in the united states, it seems.  for instance, levis jeans will run you approximately 90 dollars.  the  cheapest  i've found for a pair of levis is 73 bucks, which is, quite frankly, unconscionable.  you run into much the same problem with shoes - anything like nike, reebok, or adidas will run you consistently 10-20 dollars more than expected.  it's even worse with electronics - especially those which have entertainment value.  dvd's in the states mostly cost between 15 and 25 dollars, with an impressively varied selection available at the lower end of that range.  you can even get plenty of choices of movies that don't suck for less than ten dollars.  here, only the crappiest of craptacular movies can be acquired for 15 bucks.  cd's are even more unpleasant - 21-23 euros for a new album.  it seriously inhibits any desire you have to pick up new music.  on the plus side, it makes the cd's they randomly lower to 8.99 seem far more attractive...  (here's the kicker - apparently cd prices are even WORSE other places over here in europe...to the point that the irish lecteurs comment about how cheap cd's are here.)  and how about a whole paragraph dedicated to the outrageous prices on video games?  i think it's appropriate.  i also think i'm a giant nerd, but that's another matter.  anyhoo, every single gamecube game is at least 10 dollars more expensive than in the states.  gameboy advance prices are far more horrifying - they tend to cost at least twice as much as they do in the states.  Golden Sun - US: 19.99  France: 44.50.  Castlevania Harmony of Dissonance - US: 19.99  France: 54.50.  Metroid Fusion - US: 24.99  France: 44.50.  golden sun  used  cost 5 dollars more than it would brand new in the states.  and yeesh - system prices are absolutely through the roof.  i also hearken back to the days when i thought 2 bucks for laundry at college was expensive.  not so anymore when it costs 3.50 to wash your clothes and 40 cents for every 5 minutes you get in the dryers.  i mean...wow.  i had absolutely no idea it was that bad.  i would LOVE to pay 2 dollars a wash with unlimited free drying these days.  on the not-first hand (you know...the other one.), you can get into movies for something like 6 bucks with a student discount, and buy 9 liters of bottled water for a dollar.  and not crappy water, but good mineral water.  you can even get a liter and a half of evian for something on the order of 54 cents.  and pastry prices?  with so many boulangeries duking it out all over the place, you can snag things for pretty much dirt-cheap.  AND here's a great thing...you don't tip!  not at bars and not at restaurants - i should go out to the bars more often and take advantage of this little gift.  righty-o, it's friday night, which means....grocery shopping!  see y'all.

      an addendum to the prior post: i also discovered how smart an idea it was to unplug the cordless phone and turn off the ringer on the corded one when retiring early for the night...given that i had 3 messages waiting for me in the morning, including two sent somewhere between 10:30 and 11:30 which would've been painful even on normal nights before working (since i need to get up at 6:45 for my 8 am classes.)  gotta leave now because it's 6:45 pm and i'm starting to feel sleepy.  he may be kinda pudgy now, but joel hodgson is still damn cool!

      okay, i am duly impressed by the english department here.  i have yet another lab that has been double-scheduled, as do many of the other lecteurs here.  i mean, what the hell?  on another note, for those of you who didn't grow up in the 'Bury (that would be you, Sockless...and okay, so maybe ben drew and yann as well), 'Whitey' refers to me.  a comment on my pasty skin, as most of you know.  not the most thrilling of names, as you might guess, but it stuck.  on the other hand, it's slightly more descriptive (and less boring) than 'Mike'.  of course, when  I  say 'mike', it has a certain flair to it.  maybe i should start going by Kael instead - i mean, it works for Xander, Topher, et al, so why not Mikael?  hmmmmm....  there's the added bonus that i might possibly be the first one, but i'd have to do something drastic to override what everyone else calls me.  you know...something like 'move to california' (although, with colin and eric there, i'd never get away with it.  bastards!  keepin' me down...)

      why are so many people so tiny over here?  more specifically, why the hell can these people not conceive of someone whose foot size is larger than 12.5?  it's positively vexing.  very very vexing.  in fact, i am irked.  it doesn't even matter how good the sales are (because france is  still  on sale) - at least, how good the sales on shoes are - because i can't find anything to fit my gigantic american feet.  i spent days upon days searching for something that i might conceivably be able to wedge my foot into.  of course, i was completely thwarted by the tiny people here and ended up buying a kite to make myself feel better.  wallowing in self-pity, i know.  why a kite?  i don't know.  i wanted one and it was there at the store.  had to give in and ask my parents to send my running shoes to me.  stupid france...

      Hey everybody!  It's Colin here with a Sunday rant!  And believe me, this one's gonna make the world LOVE me!  (Can you FEEL the sarcasm?)   So basically, last night, I was reminded just how much I hate humanity.  I had to go to the mall to pick up a new powerstrip, because I thought my old one had gone kaput.  Turned out the socket it was plugged into just died.  Anyway, I live about 30 seconds from the Third Largest Mall in America, the King of Prussia Mall!  Ooo, how exciting that is.  So I had to walk through the teeming masses of people from one end of the mall to the other to find myself a RadioShack, the only place in this mall that actually sells powerstrips.  Because really, who would want one of those?  Anyway, dodging through the crowds of fools, jackasses, and idiots, I realized just how much I despise people.  Which is kind of awkward, since, politically, I'm an anti-authoritarian socialist.  So for those few of you who read Whitey's blog and don't know me, that's your intro to rant-a-riffic me.  See you next week, when I rant about something else that really pisses me off... probably more specific than the human race.

Ben: "what?  foreplay?  no kiddies, you like  to  play.  you might LIKE foreplay, but that's not what you're trying to say."    and - i shall also take this time to reveal that colin has admin privileges (surprise!  even to him!).  i cannibalized the old "we-don't-drink-enough-for-this-'drunken-blog'," of which he was one of the admins.  so colin, you are cordially invited to contribute a weekly sunday column on whatever topic you choose - an offering to the blog gods, as it were.

        (imdb.com) does anyone else think it's time that jack black changed his imdb photo?  is it just me, or is Destiny's Child just a sluttier, less-talented version of En Vogue?  (i mean, right down to the fact that both groups started off with 4 people and then duked it out until only 3 were left.)  having trouble understanding things lately (both spoken and written).  for example, i was at a bookstore and thought i saw "tom stoppard - 'transvestites'."  it took probably about 5 minutes before i realized that it was ' travesties '.  finished reading "watership down" the other day then looked inside the back cover to see "ankles to head w/music" written in pencil.  great.  just thrilled to know that someone used my book to plan their sexual encounters.  though i guess it was their book at the time, since i bought it used.  and last, but certainly not least - your secret name is Usul!!!  did you hear that everybody?  HIS SECRET NAME IS  USUL !

      from mike's earlier post(btw, this is eric, utilizing my all-powerful admin rights), here is  urlLink tori amo's take on 'smells like teen spirit'  in full.  as a nirvana fan, i'm truly appalled, and thankfully, i have no perspective as a tori amos fan, not being one.  download only if you're already completely desensitized to the state of music today.

      those of you from the 'Bury will appreciate this:  i was told that i "looked really pale the last couple weeks" and i think something about how it made it look like i was sick.  furthermore, i "look much better today"...the irony being that it's the color i get when i'm not at my best.  i'm not sick, but i basically pulled two consecutive all-nighters, so my face is a bit flushed at the moment.  of course, "flushed" on me translates into "healthy" for any normal person.  so anyhoo, i'm planning on sleeping about 15 hours tonight and getting back my healthy pallor.  by the way, i made a mistake when i called brain candy the "greatest movie ever".  it's probably the greatest *feature film* ever, but the greatest movie ever is quite possibly the sock puppet video alex and the gang made back in the day.  (okay, so technically there were two of them, but i'm treating the two as one singular entity.)  it has  everything ...  action!  romance!  head(errrrrr....socks have heads, right?)-banging!  the slaying of diego!  ("i sense something whiny."  john-in-'catherine-kelly'-voice: "it's diego.  it's hideous."  at least i think it was murph's voice.  maybe it was stalin's.)  a sean tulin head replacing the forgotten sean tulin sock puppet!  i'm tellin' you, these puppies should be issued to every single person in the class of '99 (and to me and eric, of course.  matt too, if he wants one.  and a special "whinier version" with director's commentary for diego.)

      Sleepless McGee... 2 hours or fewer last night after none the night before.  is it possible to have a book addiction?  because i don't have a valid reason for either night except that i had a good book i wanted to finish.  poor french students.  didn't mean to inflict them with this.  one of them knows a tae kwon do group here, though, so the day has already been productive and it's only 9:50.

      okay - the other classes ended up meeting pretty much as normal.  definitely had several fewer students in each lab than normal, but enough to actually run the lab.  besides, i made up the extra time by teaching them some frisbee fakes...  hold the phone - i've got a whiteboard...and a dry erase pen....it's time to introduce them to stack and cup!  (though, of course, 'Bury Rules are best.  free form ultimate being so much more fun than "okay, we're going to run this play now"-ultimate.)

      wow!  not even 20 minutes into teaching again and the games have begun!  right - so i show up at the university at 7:45 under the impression that i will be teaching at 8.  could i have  been  more wrong???  i think not!  apparently, the department secretary scheduled multiple classes for the kiddies at the same exact time.  now, to be fair, that type of scheme CAN be done (take, for example, the second semester of my senior year when i took 'history of math' and 'realists and romantics' concurrently/simultaneously), i just don't think these frenchies are up to that challenge.  my class of 12 students had 2 show up...doubling the attendance of each of the other lecteurs (except patrick, who got an earth-shaking *six*).  right now there are 4 lecteurs sittin' around wondering if the same thing is going to happen to all the other classes throughout the day.  it's like recess!  here's the really great part - or unfortunate part, if you're a french student missing out on my labs - i didn't sleep last night.  not one wink.  and lack of sleep in mike leads to much lunacy in the classroom.  and boy did i come prepared for lunacy; what with the frisbee shirt, bandana, and rochester ultimate disc.  personally, i liked this exchange: (singing) "good mornin'  good mo-o-ornin'!" "well you're wide awake this morning..." "which is ironic, considering that i didn't sleep last night." "oh - partying?" "nope.  good book."  anyway, i'll check in later with the final tally of the day.  while you're waiting, i highly recommend checking out theonion.com's "what do you think" section.

      random day!  where the heck did the term "cakewalk" come from?  who the hell was walking around stepping on cakes thinking "man this is easy!" ?  besides, wouldn't be kinda slippery with the frosting?  another thing - the star spangled banner.  "spangled"?  according to dictionary.com, on of the definitions of spangle is "A small sparkling object, drop, or spot."  that's just weird.  that's yet another one of those words that sounds dirty but isn't.  i was coming back on the metro today and at one of the stops there was a guy standing about 2 feet away from the glass doors moonwalking.  he had this big dopey grin on his face and he was just dancing around and bustin' out with his moonwalk skillz.  for people who have read the sword of truth series (of which i've only finished the first two books), does Richard Cypher seem like Mr. Furious from 'Mystery Men'?   "and you are....?" "Richard Cypher." "and your special power is....?" "i get very very furious." "and how is that special?" "i'm a volcano - a ticking timebomb of fury!"  i saw a CD at the virgin megastore the other night - "Short Music for Short People: 101 Bands Singing 30 Second Songs."   so bizarre...  there was a sign at the bus stop:  "avec notre produit, vos mains peuvent faire le nudisme jusqu'� -20�".  welcome to france - home of the nudist hands!  amazon.com wants YOU to listen a clip from tori amos' album  urlLink crucify.   that clip?   urlLink smells like teen spirit.   imdb mentions "Recovering former Beverly Hills 90210 star Jason Priestley..."  makes it sound like "recovering crack addict jason priestley."  90210 musta been bad for his health.

      i forgot one thing about the waffle party.  i think my favorite moment from that night was when i managed to get 3 or so other people going off on a full rendition of the fresh prince of bel air theme.  come to think of it, was there any better running gag on tv than dj jazzy jeff getting thrown out of the house by uncle phil?  man, and then the time will and jazz bought the car and pissed off uncle phil in the driveway? "haHA - you can't throw me outta the house 'cuz i'm already outside." (uncle phil slowly sidles up to jazz) "aaah!" (as jazz gets flung  into  the house)  right - anyway - moving on...  french radio!  i've promised details for quite some time now, and i think it's time to follow through lest you, loyal readers, dub me a tease.  first off, the radio stations here would play ONLY american songs if they could get away with it.  well, a few british ones too, but mainly american.  unfortunately for them, there's a law that states that 40% of airtime must go to french songs.  unfortunately for  me , that 40% gets taken up by - at most - 5 songs.  one of them starts off with some cool edgy slide guitar and then inexcusably shifts into a sappy duet/love song.  it has quite possibly ruined my appreciation for slide guitar.  a second one is this weird-ass song about how "when i was young, i was a jedi."  now, 95% of the song is in french, but there's one line in english when the guy sings "when. i. was. a child.    i was a jedi." - which took my about 2 months to figure out because of the way he said "jedi."  first, take the "g" sound from "beige" and use that for the "j" in "jedi."  then, when you say the "i" part of "jedi", try to create a sound halfway between "eye" and "oy."  for those of you who have taken french before, that's very similar to the word "oeil."  not only is it a terrible song, but it completely mangles the word "jedi."  oh yes, and let's not forget THIS little gem... there's a song here that goes (translated) "i was having a problem on my plantation..."  who cares, you ask?  well, one of the aforementioned "five songs" is a parody of the plantation ditty.  "i have a little problem in my pants./why won't it get bigger?/i have a little problem with my erections" etc etc.  the singer then proceeds to tell you about all the things he's tried - including one lustily-sung segment where he says "i tried shakira" followed by a defeated "why didn't that work?"  great, i'm sure shakira is absolutely  thrilled  that there's a song about a guy trying to masturbate to her.  i'm not sure which is more humiliating: the fact that the guy is singing about trying to jerk off to her, or the fact that he does so unsuccessfully.  (Aside: back in college, one of my friends explained a phrase to me.  he told me that "'bate rape" is when one masturbates while thinking about a particular girl, then tells her about it.  i think this song qualifies.)  speaking of shakira - do you like her "objection/tango" song?  do you really really like it?  do you want to hear it every hour - nay - every  half  hour?  then come on over to france!  how about eminem's theme from "8 mile"?  or pink's "like a pill"?  or phil collins' "i can't stop lovin' you"?  do you dream about places that play "all the things you said" and that new robbie williams song ("i just wanna feel real love" or somesuch) practically non-stop?  then france is the place for you!  and how about the timeless never-gets-old anthem "jenny from the block"?  or perhaps your tastes swing more to - wait,  fooled you !  there ARE no other songs for your listening pleasure.  the one plus side, it never gets tiresome hearing the dj's say "pheeLEEP co-LEENS avec 'kent stoap loveeng you'."  two consequences: 1. i'm counting the days until my cd binder arrives; 2. my soundgarden album is getting a LOT of playtime.

      since i don't have as much time as expected today (said i'd make a recording as a favor to one of the profs here), i don't have enough time to tackle french radio...  instead, i'll just inform you that there was ANOTHER protest today.  this time it was a big march protesting retirement stuff - that's right...gobs and gobs of uppity old folks.  i was able to cross the street just in front of the parade or i would have been s.o.l. at reaching the metro.  the worst part was that they had multiple vans driving along with some old woman singing...badly.  "we're here!  we're clear!  we don't want any more bears!"  and i found a frisbee game...   (pic on videogamereview.com)  too bad it  urlLink sucks...

         Police Nab Suspected Ringleader of Hussein Sympathizers   In a triumphant coup for domestic peacekeeping officials, the Federal Protective Services arrested Father Louis Vitale at an anti-war demonstration yesterday.  Long suspected of organizing the nation's largest pro-Hussein group, Father Vitale was seized after allegedly instigating Thursday's anti-war rally in San Francisco.  "We have been keeping Father Vitale under tight surveillance for the past several months," said Officer-in-charge Tim Hayworth, "it was only a matter of time before he slipped up."  Although Father Vitale was unavailable for comment, his followers have been very vocal in their support for the priest.  "He's always telling us about the value of peace and how war leads to the corruption of the human soul," said one disciple on condition of anonymity.  Upon hearing this statement, Hayworth responded, "Do you see the type of subversive message this man was spreading?  He has gone out of his way to undermine the faith these people have in their country and seriously destabilized the security of the American people.  His attempts to dissuade the U.S. from its righteous war on Iraq clearly show him to be in league with Saddam Hussein."  Hayworth continued on under his breath in a voice possibly not meant to be audible, "Lousy peaceniks..."  Many eyewitnesses described Father Vitale as a "menace" and an "insurrectionist" while many more intimated that they felt much safer with him off the streets and secured behind bars.  "I bet he was hiding chemical weapons under that fancy dress he was wearing," area carpenter Mark Hobson declared.  "I mean, come on!  A man wearing a dress in San Francisco?  He must've been up to something shady."  No court date has been set as yet, but prosecutors are expected to push for an immediate trial.  Assistant DA Clara Williams let it be known that "we must send a message to all would-be supporters of our enemies that such action will under no circumstances be tolerated, that they will be caught, and that they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law" before adding a jubilant "take that, bitch!"

      oral expression classes are...weird.  especially when the instructor for the other half of the class has them work 6 straight weeks on writing a short little play/skit in small groups and then has each group perform for the entire class.  three observations:  1) french students really  really  like to use the word "fuck."  2) it's possible for a play to be entirely in english while i remain incapable of understanding more than one word out of five.  3) there's not much funnier than watching a short blonde french girl acting like a hulking sex-crazed american guy.  i'll just summarize the first play - before they even start, the two girls write "Condom or No Condom?" on the board...good times.  oh hell, i'll just hit the highlights.  short blonde girl sidles up to "drunken" girl (who's wearing a blonde wig).  starts hitting on her in amazingly brazen male fashion.  takes her to the bathroom to puke (and doesn't even hold her hair back!).  "drunken" girl asks 'how can i ever repay you?' ("repay you" for what, for cryin' out loud?  not holding your hair back?  invading the women's bathroom?  buying the vodka that made you boot?)  to which the other responds - 'you're so hot, i want you!'  "drunken" girl seems amenable...until "whoops!  no condom!"  meanwhile, i'm desperately trying not to laugh as she recounts to her friend that the dude "wanted to fuck with me in the bathroom!"  ("he wanted to fuck with you??"  "yes!  he wanted to fuck with me!").  at some point i'm going to have to bring up how "fucking" someone is different than "fucking WITH" someone.  ("okay, kiddies.  you can  fuck  someone or you can  get with/have sex with  someone.  however, if i'm 'fucking with' someone, odds are very low that my pants are undone.")

      damnitall - i went home hoping to get a letter from the Allocation Familiale people saying that they put money in my account (lodging aid), and instead i get the complete opposite: a letter asking for my work contract and salary bulletin (which means that they're going to give me less money)...and an electric bill for 131 euros.  so instead of  receiving  at least 200 euros, i'm expected to shell out over a hundred.  for those of you scoring at home (or even if you're alone), that's more than a 300 euro swing in the unhappy direction.

      dolphins are  urlLink cool .  on the other hand, what if a dolphin finds a mine and then reverts to sea world days?  "ooh!  a round ball!  i think i'll balance this on my nose..." disaster ensues.  also, the weather here is fantastic.  sunny, but not  too  sunny.  warm, but not overbearingly so.  and by some miracle, it hasn't rained in almost 2 weeks - i'm a fan.  it's funny watching the students flock to every available patch of grass, though it has become obvious that this university needs more grass...or fewer students.  i'm not sure which i'd prefer.  it's also bizarre in the extreme to see hundreds of students putzing around outside...and not a single frisbee in the air.  so weird.

      Rennes has an exposition celebrating the 200th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase, which - in my humble opinion - would be akin to the Red Sox throwing a party to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Larry Andersen for Jeff Bagwell trade.  On a completely different note, there's been half of a dead bird lying at the top of the steps outside for over a week now.  Actually, that's being a bit generous to the (former) bird - it's only the legs and tail feathers section, so it's really more of a bird  ass  than anything else.  Well, whatever it is, maintenance should definitely have cleaned it up by now.  I hate segues...almost as much as I hate paying taxes (grumble grumble grumble).  And with the coming of spring and warm weather, it's time for the traditional reference to the onion archives...   urlLink Check it out .  To be perfectly honest, the women here seem to take this article a little bit too far.  I was walking to the bus stop today and this woman passed by walking in the other direction - I'm pretty sure she took the concept of the push-up bra and applied it to a dinner platter instead.  If she had removed her top, I wouldn't have been surprised at all to see her breasts supported by a large silver dish - although I obviously would've been fairly startled to see her remove her top in broad daylight in the middle of a busy intersection, come to think of it.    because how could i  not  follow the above paragraph with a picture of bill clinton... and because his pictures are funny.

      taxes are due today, which begs the question: do i need to declare?  you'd probably be surprised about the sheer amount of contradictory information you run into over here.  "yes, you do."  "no, you don't."  "i dunno."  "only if you've worked here two years."  "you should declare...then abscond."  "lecteurs don't have to declare."  "you don't make enough money/work enough hours."  "you don't make enough money/work enough hours....but only if you're working for an american company over here."  "i eat paste."  gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  the sucky part is that i'm going to end up declaring (i have another 5 hours or so to decide), and then i'm guaranteed to get this "taxe d'habitation" for around 500 euros - which i can supposedly get a reduction on, but still...  only one lecteur declared last year, and it seems to be common policy, but if i ever decide i want to work in france again, i might as well not have "tax evasion" on my record here.  yet another example of me screwing myself out of a lot of money because i'm too damn honest for my own good.

      here's an email i sent to eric yesterday:  > it appears that CRI has reset the NT server here or > something, which means that my text documents, > bookmarks, and saved files have all disappeared.  most > infuriatingly of all, that means that EVERY SINGLE get > fuzzy i've saved since i got to france has been wiped > away.  i hope that this is temporary and that they'll > restore everyone's files soon, but somehow i doubt > it... >  > i am so fucking pissed.  well, it's not any better today.  even worse, i went through the get fuzzy thirty day archive and re-saved all the ones i wanted to keep...only to have the stupid server erase everything by the time i next signed on.  in fact, it does this EVERY time!  whee!  which means that i can't save a goddamn thing ever again - bring on the emails to myself, because that's the only way i'll be able to keep reminders on these computers now.  what  really  sucks my will to live is the fact that i now have to go through those stupid windows "this is the first time you've used this program, do you need help?" messages every damn time.  "for the twentieth time, i do NOT want internet explorer to be my default browser!  stop asking me!!!"  here's the fun part, i'd almost  want  to get that message now, because it would mean i was using internet explorer instead of avoiding it because it's non-functional.  unfortunately, i get this weird-ass alert message that "you're not administrative personnel, so don't expect to use the internet, foo'."  (so i'm paraphrasing - shoot me...).  netscape works, but the version of netscape they have here (netscape negative-6.7) sucks my left nut.  and since i don't have admin rights, i can't upgrade it.  sooooo, this means i can no longer do any financial stuff on the computers here because neither my bank, the phone card, nor the loan center sites allow you to use a browser without 128-bit incryption.  why would i want to pay my student loans, anyway?  what a silly idea.  and the suck-tastic part is that to add insult to injury (or rub salt in the wound, if you prefer), netscape has heart attacks whenever i try to load yahoo sports, or espn, or gamespot, or pretty much any marginally cool site that i might want to look at.  and it messes with the blogger posting site such that i have to type in the html crap by hand instead of just highlighting and clicking a button on the upper right toolbar.  and wanna know something funny?  this university is probably the only one where the computer people don't have an email address on their university homepage.  how asinine is that?  the only "contact information" is a list of hours that their info desk is open.  makes you real confident in their ability to fix stuff if they don't even appear to have an email address, huh?  of course, what should you expect from a department that sends alerts out to you that "you are using 60% of the space alloted to you.  please delete something" after they've gone and erased everything.  two questions: 1) if i'm only using 60% of the space alloted to me, why do i need to delete anything?  this is like that stupid 'flair' thing from office space - if i'm supposed to get 10 megs of space (i just made up that number, i don't know if it's real or not), but they tell me that i have to delete things after i use 6 megs, then shouldn't they just give me freakin' 6 megs instead and call that my share?  ("yes, it  says  17 pieces of flair, but we really think that...").  and 2) how the bloody fuck could i possibly be using 60% of my space after they wiped my file cleaner than god?  (assuming god to be a fairly clean dude).  in the words of bill murray from ghostbusters: "mother puss bucket"

      Quick note about French protests:  it  sounds  like people are getting pretty uppity here, but i'm fairly sure the french are trying to pull a fast one on us.  i mean, yes, there's a lot of yelling and a constant barrage of discontented chanting, but oft-times it's just one dude with a bullhorn shouting into a crowd of his two best friends.  sometimes, one of the friends has a bullhorn too.  it's reminiscent of Sigma Nu in the basement of Crosby at UR - they'd blast party music at max volume out of these gigunda speakers to make it sound like their frat was really "rockin'," but usually if you wandered by you'd find just one guy sitting alone on a couch drinking soda.

      france loves its irish heritage!  really.  i mean it.  from irish bars to irish stores, they're pretty loaded over here.  okay, so i exaggerate a little bit, but it's far more than i'd expect out of a country that values it's own culture so highly.  still, there are tons of billboards around with black sheep dressed in stereotypically irish attire advertising jameson's irish whiskey.  and st. patrick's day got a far greater response than i expected - although considering that the Westport was packed and O'Connell's was so full that people had to mill around outside (i'm sure the other "irish" pubs were suitably plenished as well), it seems rather suspicious that not a single one of my students says they went out.  lying bastards!  lots of cool-ass clown 'fros too.  orange, green, and white.  incredibly bright green.  good times.  i think my favorite was the old drunken toothless dude who got on the metro with his huge green 'fro.  that's the spirit!  ummmm....'cause it's "irish" and stuff.  yeah.

      forgot to mention that i changed the url for point/counterpoint.  it is now  urlLink here  at http://pointcounterpoint.blogspot.com.  evidently, the windows nt server here prevents people from viewing websites with an underscore in the address.  paranoid freaks.  among baseball's  urlLink crappier ideas  (espn.com)...  baseball officials talk about europe as an "untapped resource", but don't stop to wonder if there's a reason it was left untapped.  honestly, they don't even know the rules of the game over here in france.  and i don't mean things like the infield fly rule.  i'm talking about not knowing that there's a fielding team and a batting team.  baseball caps are virtually nonexistent, and even then they rarely represent a team of any kind, just a company logo or somesuch.  i've seen one dodgers hat, one cardinals hat, and one red sox hat.  the only team that has any sort of significant following over here is......you guessed it!  the yankees!  and probably only because people think the logo looks cool.  reminds me of my french professor telling us about how back in the early 80's UCLA t-shirts suddenly started sprouting up all over paris.  apparently, my professor asked a girl why she was wearing one of them and her response was "what's wrong with my ookla t-shirt?"  stay away, baseball.  stay away!

      people here are getting really testy about english - more and more often of late, you'll get dirty looks from people solely because you speak english...or "the devil's tongue" as people in New Gaul seem to believe.  today though, it crossed the line from dirty looks to bitchy loud-mouthed complaints.  not once, but twice!  maybe it's because today is "The Deadline" for iraq.  who knows?  i really couldn't care less about the jackasses here, though.  i'll just wear the captain america shirt more often now.  that'll teach 'em.  looking forward to getting my travel photos back...even if the eiffel tower (at night) didn't come out on my friends' cameras.  maybe that'll finally prompt me to give you the lowdown on some nearby places.  of course, i'm pretty damn lazy, so it probably won't.

      i got totally faked out by the post office the other day.  after i got out of the shower, someone buzzed on my doorbell.  thinking to myself, "i'm dripping wet, i sure as hell ain't rushing to talk to that person", i opted not to respond.  only afterwards did i realize that "oh man, i hope that wasn't the post office."  sure enough, when i got outside there was a little notice in my mailbox about how "i came to your door but i could not deliver the letter or package because (X) absent  ( ) other reasons __________ .  please go to the post office sometime between tomorrow and 2 weeks from now to collect the item."  first reaction - someone sent me a package??? second reaction - and it was TOO BIG FOR MY MAILBOX!!!! third reaction - whoo hoo!  so i'm practically bouncing up and down with excitement for the entire day wondering what the heck it is and who sent it...  the next day i go to the post office, happily hand them the little notice and wait patiently while the woman retrieves my package.  when she returns with a miniscule little letter that she opens in some complicated fashion, i continue to stand there awaiting her return with the expected *big* package.  not the case.  nope - it was an insured letter (2 euros and 82 centimes postage) demanding payment...for a bill i'd already paid.  such a freakin' letdown.  i had to dig out my receipt, walk over, explain the situation, and then come to terms with the fact that i would NOT, in fact, be receiving a package of any kind.  on the other hand, at least the idiocy of the people demanding payment ended up costing them almost 3 euros.  teehee.

      Kittens are like cotton candy:  they're sweet, fluffy, and best consumed on a stick.  ....and on to the metro!  right, so last march, rennes debuted its brand spankin' new metro - only one line, but it does a more than admirable job covering a large portion of the city.  the Powers That Be, however, seem a little too taken with it and have declared this week "Metro Anniversary Week", completely with smarmy pictures hung everywhere of the metro as it was being constructed...and closeups of people that look like they came straight out of political "family values" posters.  oh yeah, and the return of crappy music.  (oh-so-craptacular music).  fair enough, but the metro isn't all that and a bag of chips - in fact, it's not even all that OR a bag of chips.  i like it; i'm glad it's there, but this whole propaganda thing is practically sickening.  so without further ado, here's a list of things that have gone WRONG with the metro:  1) The Fire - Part I:  Early in October, a particularly heavy rainstorm shorted out the power generators and started an electrical fire that shut down the metro for the entire day.  2) Maintenance-time:  The metro is closed between 12:45 am and 5:45 am - so when do they choose to shut down several cars and work on them?  During the morning rush hour, of course!  3) Rush Hour:  French people find the concept of a line beyond there comprehension.  Therefore, every morning leads to a free-for-all of flying elbows, shoulder checks, and low-blows until you battle your way into a metro which tends to be so crowded you need a shoehorn to squeeze yourself into place.  4) The Puke Incident:  Can't figure out why there's a nearly empty metro car during the morning rush?  That's because of the pool of vomit slowly oozing across the entire floor!  5) The Fire - Part II:  Yann was on the metro last night when the damn thing caught on fire...while he and everyone else were trapped inside.  6) The Gestapo Inspectors:  They swarm to a station and interrogate every single person who gets off there - if they had turnstiles, this would be unnecessary, but nooooooo.  Usually, they pick on the university stop because they seem to like making students' lives hell.  Oh yeah, and if you get caught without a pass/ticket, you get slapped with a 58 euro fine (which happened to my friend Patrick here...the poor bastard).

      by the way, feel free to check out the kael/eric  urlLink collaboration that i cannot load  but to which i can contribute, nonetheless.  tomorrow's debate should be fun....  teehee.  given that it's "metro anniversary week" here in rennes, i would be remiss if i didn't talk about it by the morrow.  sorry, no songs by Lyle Lanley as it's not a monorail.

      sadly, i must inform you that with the coming of spring (and warm weather), france has proven to smell just like canada.  eric can tell you what that means.  at least the warmth prompted some of the music students to go outside and play a mini-concert.  random live jazzy music at lunch-time?  sweet!

      people who take kitten-blending as a serious topic of discussion are sick.  sick i say!  foolishly believing i had chosen a topic so far over-the-top as to never in my wildest dreams elicit anyone's ire, i "Pointed" in such a manner as to force eric into the indefensible position that kittens should be run through the blender.  how could i have been so naive?  after my rant about how much i disliked dogs and my decided preference for felus domesticus, i thought that surely no one could possibly take my posting without a grain of salt - or hell, a whole salt mine.  bah.  hmmmm....something french....  colin found  urlLink this  article: check it out.

       counterpoint:  it's morally prudent(and fun) to put kittens in the blender  boy, i hope this somehow guarantees that i'll never hold public office(just playing by the rules).  anyways, it just makes sense to put kittens in the blender.  as kael pointed out, they fit perfectly.  it's like kittens and blenders were always meant for each other.  and what could be better than picking up some kittens at the shelter and taking them home to meet your blender?  and really, nothing lures sharks quite like kitten chum.  that's a proven fact, just ask steven spielberg.  and what would we do without watching 'shark week' on the discovery channel?  vote 'yes' to the pureeing of kittens.

       POINT:   It's wrong to put kittens in the blender.  Just imagine - a helpless little kitten sits in your lap.  You pet it, play with it, and then cruelly and viciously grind it to death in a blender.  There's simply no call for kitten-blending in this day and age.  Just because a kitten  fits  in the blender doesn't give you the right to do it.  Kitten shakes are not meant to be consumed by the enlightened human beings of the new millenium, nor should kitten chum be allowed to lure sharks for National Geographic anymore.  I say that the time has long come when people should rise up and say "No!" to this horrific act of violence against kittens.

      i need better minions.  thinking that someone would make a "point" on saturday, i chose to run some errands instead of making a special trip to the university just to blog.  little did i know that my peons put the "lack" in "lackey" and left my blog bereft of a saturday point or a sunday counterpoint.  looks like i shall be coming in on saturdays again and perhaps emailing eric a sunday post to keep my loyal following happy (all two of you).  i'm pretty tired from running around throwing a frisbee to...myself, so this blog will be pretty short.  this homeless dude asked me for some money, and - feeling magnanimous today - i gave him about fitty (spelled like that on purpose) cents...at which point he tried to buy the bandana off my head.  i mean, this guy was very taken with it.  after i said no, he quickly responded "i have money!" and brought out a handful of change (which actually tends to amount to several bucks over here in europe where they have one and two euro coins).  i told him no again and that i only had one and he just kept asking how much i wanted for it.  finally he was like "but i wanna look like a pirate!!!"  oh yeah, and i really don't like the birds here...especially the one that crapped on my hand as i was walking home.  just walkin', mindin' my own business, noticin' that a few drops of rain had started to fall - felt a big fat drop on the back of my right hand and thought to myself, "wow - that one was warm.  what's up with that?".  sure enough...bird crap.  hmmmm....tomorrow?  haven't talked about any of the places i visited over break (first time i've really gone traveling since i got here) - orrrrrrrr, i could take point/counterpoint into my own hands (with a reliable second, eric lee).  new rule - the counterpoint person MUST disagree and argue the antithesis.

      bubba ho-tep has got to be one of the greatest movie ideas i've ever heard of - the real elvis (who switched places with an impersonator back in the day) is alive and geriatric in a nursing home.  he and a black guy who thinks he's JFK team up to fight an ancient egyptian demon which is preying on the residents.  and it stars bruce campbell!  and it's directed by don coscarelli, who brought us Phantasm and "TNT's Second Greatest Late Night Movie" - The Beastmaster (which ranks slightly below Gymkata).  it's sheer genius!  did i mention that it stars bruce campbell?   beyond  genius!  bruce campbell is probably at the head of the list when it comes to movies i will see solely because of a particular actor.  (jason lee is a close second).  why at the top of the list?  because he has the power to overcome the most craptacular of plots, premises, budgets, costars, etc, and pique my interest enough to see truly horrendous films which i would otherwise disparage.  usually there has to be some spark of interest that the actor brings to life for me to see a movie that i would normally avoid  - but bruce campbell IS the spark of interest.  "maniac cop" here i come!  you should all read the book, "if chins could kill: confessions of a b-movie actor."  you will be entertained.  you will thank me.  or suffer the consequences.

      i love french movies!    (cine35.com)  right - so see the incredibly white guy with the cheesy 'stache on the right?  (yup, that's him!)  yeah....so his character apparently thinks he's alphonse brown, the secret child of james brown.  movie ensues.  of course, it's somewhat of an eerie reversal of  urlLink Bubba Ho-Tep  (imdb), in which a distinctly black ossie davis thinks he's JFK (because the CIA dyed him black, dontcha know?)  hmmmm - i think i'll devote tomorrow's blog to Bubba Ho-Tep....or maybe Bruce Campbell: Acting God (as in "god of acting", not like when riker calls himself "acting captain" when picard goes down).  here's the  urlLink official site  as an appetizer.   on a completely unrelated note, i saw a yahoo headline which read  urlLink "Republicans Can't Stop Estrada Filibuster"  and thought to myself "what the hell is erik estrada doing in the senate?"

      yeesh.  i just discovered that sophie and i contrived to give a native english speaker a 12/20 for their first semester lab grade.  to be fair, she moved to france 8 years ago, speaks far too quietly, makes occasional mistakes, and never appeared to be putting out any effort (which i guess makes sense  now ...)  oh well.  Stupid Sports Things that Piss Me Off ("Rule Violation" Category):   The "Double-Play":  if you don't touch the base, you don't get the out.   Lane Violations:  damnitall - why don't they call basketball players for jumping into the lane early on free throws anymore?   The Ewing Shuffle:  establish a pivot foot!  for chrissakes ESTABLISH A PIVOT FOOT!  on the flip side, i finally pinpointed my favorite nomar play.  first off, the dude is a postseason god - too bad he's only been in it twice.  secondly, he was just about the only player who stepped up to the challenge during the '99 ALCS against the yankees (as did pedro), which featured the play to which i refer.  the two leaping stabbing catches?  amazing...but neither's the one i mean.  oddly enough, i most remember a soft infield grounder.  nomar hit this little tapper straight at one of the yankees, but he fucking TORE down the line - he was out of the batter's box faster than any other player i've ever seen and literally streaked up the line towards first base.  no regard for the hamstrings that had hampered him all year; when he hit the bag he was  flyin' .  it should have been the easiest out of the game, but nomar turned it into one of the closest plays i've ever seen at first base.  it's a shame the ump called him out, and maybe it would've been different at fenway, but i can't really fault the ump for the call he made.   and somehow it doesn't diminish the play for me, possibly because of nomar's reaction - how fired up he got about it, like at that moment the most important thing in the world was  that call  and how much the red sox needed it.  it wasn't about him being safe, it was about how the team absolutely NEEDED something to go their way.  if the red sox ever trade nomar, i'll probably cry ('cuz i'm a little wuss and a crybaby).  don't worry joe, no sports tomorrow.

      allow me to rebut:  french beer deserves far more credit than it is generally accorded.  in fact, france has several beyond-decent ones that my friends and i tried over the last week - i can't recall their names because they were ones i'd never heard of before.  and lest you dismiss my claim because you know of my drinking habits (or lack thereof), i can assure you that adam and beer are well acquainted.  i wouldn't be surprised if it had completely taken over his arteries and veins.  france simply suffers from its close proximity to the most famous beer-producing nation in the world.  and california wine a close second to french?  surely you jest.  consider that in france, you can get a drinkable (not pleasant, but drinkable) bottle of wine for 73 cents.  note that i said  bottle  (and i ain't talking a plastic one).  1.95 gets you a good bottle of wine, and the 16.90 version was described as "orgasmic."  i shudder to think of what the upper-end bottles are like...  ...you ignorant slut.

      The Beer Rant: Crimes against humanity - A Pennsylvania Assemblyman has indroduced a measure to ban French wine and other French imports.  Supporters also suggest dumping German beer.  Even though the resolution would be non-binding even if it passed (not to mention Unconstitutional), some tavern owners who support the anti-Franco-German sentiment are going to dump their German beer anyway.  THEY ARE DUMPING GERMAN BEER!  What the hell is wrong with these people?!  American beer sucks!  Well, not ALL American beer, but all national brands with the exception of Sam Adams.  There are also a few regional brands that are de-lish, such as Dominion (from VA - not too bad) and Yuengling (PA - mmmmm... $5 pitchers...).  Consider these "premium" beers, often similarly priced: Killian's Irish Red (A Coors product), or Beck's (or even better, Beck's dark... yum.).  The choice is obvious.  Coors even tries to pass Killian's off as Irish (to fool unsuspecting beer drinkers into thinking they aren't getting crappy American beer), but the label betrays its loyalty to Colorado.  Thankfully, we will still have Irish (Guiness) and British (New Castle) imports.  Even Corona, a crappy Mexican beer, is still better than at least 90% of US beers.  As for wine, California wine is at least a close second.  Buying Cali wine (or Italian wine) instead of French is not as enormous a step down as buying any beer made by A. Busch or Coors... or, God forbid, Genesee.  And as long as we're comparing apples and oranges, I've heard some good things about German wines, but never French beer.

      So in preparation for Point/Counterpoint, I thought it would be a good idea to let you, John Q. Public, know the rules Sockless and I were too lazy to agree upon.  The guidelines suggested by Kael are as follows:   "whoever makes the "point" chooses the topic (probably political, since you two are nearly polar opposites...) and the "counterpoint" person does a rebuttal.  then the next week, you switch off.  ummmmmm - rules?  we don't need no stinkin' rules! well, maybe just a couple.  write whatever you want - personal attacks and character assassination are not only allowed, but encouraged! (the 'ignorant slut' thing).  i figure if you both know it's in good fun, why the heck not?  i think there should be a length limit.  maybe not words - work it out between the two of you, but perhaps a line limit?  that way, you COULD post a picture, but you'd have to factor it in to the space limit.  if you use up your space with a giant picture of you giving the "point" person the finger - that's fine, but you won't be allowed to write anything. ummmmm - just no nude pics or anything.  anyway, it's kinda still in the incubation period - any suggestions?  feel free to work out the finer points between the two of you.  don't forget, it doesn't have to be political."  All the places where Kael suggested we work out the details between the two of us, we didn't.  So there you have it.

       Geek Post IV: Geeks in Love  does anyone else have absolutely no idea what the  Streaker  discovered in  urlLink startide rising ?  okay, so they found some huge derelict ships that no other race knew about, and they nabbed this mummified corpse that they called "herbie", but why are all the other species so upset about it?  they (both the terrans and the other species) have pretty much zero information about what was found, and can't even properly examine it.  i'm pretty sure the other races don't think that the  Streaker  discovered one of the Founders, but what else could explain such an uproar?  what bugs me is that david brin proceeded to write a "new uplift trilogy" which elucidated absolutely nothing and somehow managed to raise more questions and confuse the issue even further.  then again, what bugs me  most  is that we never know what happens to Creideiki, Tom Orley, and Toshio.  they're just left there stranded on the planet - brin occasionally alludes to them throughout the second trilogy, but never sheds light on their situation.  piss me off.

      so let's do some french posting, eh?  at least for the first part of the post.  checking the tracker, i ran across a search engine referral for "french food baby ducks."  so basically, i'm not planning on eating french food anymore...i say that it's time to stop consuming baby ducks.  perhaps i'll even point/counterpoint about it.  secondly, you would think that the french would've discovered the miraculous "screen" thing for their windows.  however, you'd be dead wrong.  of all the windows i've seen in france, not a single one has had a wire mesh screen.  someday the french will learn how that enables you to get fresh air into the building while eliminating 99% of the insects which would otherwise venture inside.   Geek Post III:  Zorba the Geek    so yeah, that's probably my favorite book of all time.  i don't know what it is about it.  i'd never recommend the book to anyone - in fact, i'd be far more likely to endorse  urlLink shadows fall  by the same author (simon green).  or even his  urlLink deathstalker series  under the category Good Stupid Fun.  shadows fall has one of the best premises i've ever come across for a novel in addition to its sharp writing.  deathstalker, on the other hand, is just a fun read.  don't expect any brain-stretching, but sit back and enjoy it.  it's kinda like star wars - lots of aliens, lots of ships, an evil empire, and lots of "going up against impossible odds."  mucho fun in spite of green's tendency to become enamoured with certain phrases - but since the series doesn't receive recommendation for literary value, some slight repetition doesn't knock it.  and there it is.  were someone to ask me which simon green novel they should read, i'd probably respond: if you want a really cool book that's unlike most anything i've read before or since, check out shadows fall.  if you want something that'll keep you occupied (five books) and entertained, check out deathstalker.    however, if you want more fodder for making fun of me, read Blue Moon Rising and then mock me mercilessly.  (do  not  read Beyond the Blue Moon.  it's a direct sequel, but it feels like the publishers forced him into writing it.  just leave it be after the first one.)  i by no means recommend it, but by and large i'd say it's my favorite book.  sometimes another book catches my fancy and becomes "my favorite book" for a little while, but i always wind up back with blue moon rising in the end.  and yes, i'm a stupifyingly huge nerd.

       Geek Post II: Return of the Geek   Okay, so let's say that only one of the following shows would be syndicated:  Star Trek Star Trek: The Next Generation Deep Space Nine Voyager Enterprise Babylon 5 Battlestar Galactica Farscape Seaquest: DSV Doctor Who Stargate SG-1 Mystery Science Theater 3000 Martha Stewart Living  ...which would you pick?  keep in mind, that means that no reruns of other series would be shown.  furthermore, we're trying to keep to a basic theme here, which is why X-Files isn't included - (and yes, we all love the outer limits and the twilight zone, but they don't fit the mold either.  nor does quantum leap.)  we can argue about exclusions later in another post.  so here's my take on it:  first off, i say gets rid of all the ones where the episodes are too interconnected.  syndication always manages to screw up the chronological sequence, and that would infuriate me.  Eliminated:  Farscape, DS9 (because of the later years), Babylon 5  next, toss out the ones with little in the archives.  if i only get  one  show, it better not start repeating itself too soon.  Eliminated:  Star Trek (79 episodes at 5 episodes per week lasts less than four months.  besides, they've all been played about a bazillion times), Enterprise (only one season in the can...wait five years and ask me again), Seaquest (oh yeah, and it sucked too)  it would probably also be a good idea to get rid of any series that's been put out on DVD (in its entirety).  if you can rent the episodes, you can still see them, right?  Eliminated:  ST: TNG, Stargate SG-1, Doctor Who  and i hope no one thought i was serious about Martha Stewart Living.  Eliminated:  Martha Stewart Living  let's see...that leaves - Voyager, Battlestar Galactica, and MST3K.  much as i love the adventures of starbuck and apollo (and lorne greene as adama!), i'd prefer them not to be my  only  option.  and according to imdb, there's going to be a freakin'  urlLink mini-series ...with starbuck as a woman.  Eliminated:  Battlestar Galactica  MST3K?  love it.  but let's face it, it doesn't belong with the rest of the shows.  it's mainly a comedy, and the movies they ridicule aren't even always sci-fi.  true, it'll give you two hours per day instead of just one, but that only counts for so much.  and don't neglect that many (though not all) of the episodes are available on vhs/dvd.  besides, i'm still bitter about joel leaving the show.  Eliminated:   MST3K  So basically, that leaves Voyager...until they release it on DVD.  and no, i'm not any happier about that than you are.  i kinda wanna say "screw it, i'll take Doctor Who instead."  after all, the box sets each cost upwards of 100 dollars and you probably couldn't rent them anyway.  besides, even with the 109 missing episodes, there are still almost 600 available ones - and at 30 minutes apiece, you could play two per day.  plus, the other series have all had their fair share of US airtime lately.  bring on the Doctor for a change of pace.  and if the episodes turn out to be interconnected, i'll take my chances that the station won't butcher the order...

      ummmmm... urlLink good rebuttal!   way to silence those critics.  (yahoo news)  i'd just like to say that next time someone criticizes me, i'm going to respond by posing nude.  on another note, why can't anyone start protesting against jennifer garner?  (who actually looks kinda weird to me, but she's all the rage these days and i want people to jump on board the bandwagon)  and is there anything funnier than female athletes who pose nude (or near-nude) in order to "raise awareness for the sport" ?  how do they keep a straight face when they say that?  "uh, yeah.  so, my decision to pose for a spread in playboy was based on, errrr....on my desire to further the interest of the american people in the, uhhhhhh (damnit, what the hell organization do i play for again...?), in the wnba/wusa/whatever.  and on the giant wad of money they offered me.  aw crap, did i say that out loud?  goddamnit, can i try it one more time?  no?  this is live?  crap."

      actually, i just thought of a pretty damn good reason  not  to bleach my hair, and it involves my overwhelming lassitude in the depilatory arts.  basically, it would look really weird to have bleach blond hair given my inability (on account of i-really-couldn't-give-a-rat's-ass syndrome) to shave regularly.  not that my facial hair matches my scalp hair anyway, but m'eh.  point two:  what the hell kind of album purports itself to be the "best of" billy idol, yet does not include "cradle of love"?  egregious false advertising.  point three:  urlLink not one of my better efforts   point four:  there is no point four  point five:  the people at my grocery store are finally starting to remember that i don't like plastic bags.  it's much easier carrying my purchases home in my backpack, and it cuts down on the excess of plastic bags in my apartment.  i can only use so many for trash a week, after all.  but hey, it's nice to be recognized, even if it's for "that crazy american's 'bag phobia'."  (and no, they didn't say that.  i just made it up.  i think.)  point six:  that's all, folks.  minimal building hours during break week means that i've gotta cut this short.  see y'all.

      i wouldn't mind paying student loans nearly so much if i didn't have to send money home from france in order to pay them.  if i do an electronic transfer, it costs 17 euros from my bank in france, and another 10 dollars from my bank in the states.  if i mail a check and have my dad deposit it, the bank in the states only pays 1.016 dollars per euro instead of the official exchange rate of 1.16.  it remains to be seen whether or not my bank in france will charge me for that check.  basically, i've had to pay about 70 dollars for the privilege of paying my 200 dollar per month student loans.  (and i'll need to transfer money at least once more, likely bringing the total cost up to 100 bucks.  damnit.)

      i love (but only facetiously) how the french have "easter monday," on which everything is closed.  it's great.  on another note, i have a slight issue with asimov's "Foundation" trilogy (the original, not the second set nor the new foundation books written by other authors).  here's the deal: the foundation on terminus was designed to work on condition that no one would have any idea about the forces pressuring the planet's society.  the foundation was supposed to react blindly to any given situation, especially to the "seldon crises" (a planetary crisis threatening the existence of the foundation itself in which there would be only one viable solution); the key word being "blindly."  as such, no psychologists were included among the settlers, aside from one man close to seldon who went along to teach the bare rudiments of psychology to the people of terminus.  any anticipation of future problems could ruin seldon's plan...so why didn't he account for the natural development of psychology as a science over the course of those thousand years of the "dark ages"?  not 50 years into the foundation's existence, and salvor hardin has enough foresight with his "rudimentary psychology training" to endanger seldon's plan.  he is forced to act as though he can't see the upcoming difficulties, but in spite of his care, the planned timeline of the foundation already starts to wobble a little.  the idea that people will remain in the dark for nearly a thousand years is based on the faulty assumption that the science of psychology will remain basic, at best, during that time.  of course, if seldon had planned on that, maybe the terminus foundation wouldn't have thrown things off kilter.  In which case, they never would've needed the Second Foundation at star's end to fix things...and asimov would've been out at least one book in the trilogy.  and yes i'm a giant nerd.

      i had this really weird dream where i made michael jordan cry.  and, ummmmm, as a Disturbing Look Into Mike's Subconscious, he started crying either because he felt violated or because he thought i was "better than that" - because man was i a little tramp in that dream.  there's a small possibility that i was a woman in the dream, but i'm pretty sure that we were both just plain gay.  i can imagine the discussion with my non-existent therapist now... me: so doctor, why do these....types....think that i'm one of them?  doctor: because you *are* one of them.  you are gay.  you are a gay man.  gay, as in the opposite of straight.  i know it.  your family knows it.   dogs  know it!  me:  so why am i not aware of this?  doctor:  it's called "denial."  me:  listen, doctor.  are you just going to keep spouting that psychiatric mumbo-jumbo, or-----  whoops.  slipped into "Brain Candy" there.  heh.  how'd that happen.

      good news!  well, for  me  at least.  the university will be open during the two-week break.  sure, there'll be limited hours, but it's not like i have anything pressing that will keep me from swinging by when it's open.  unfortunately, that all that i have time for today.  i didn't bother getting up early because i fully expected the building to be closed today (especially since it's the day before easter - given how seriously france takes religious holidays, i figured the country would shut down for at least a extra day on either side of easter).  getting up early on saturday  and  finding the building closed would've just been that "adding insult to injury" thing.  so looks like i'll be back in a couple days.  see y'all.

      wow...had to post one more time.  i was searching imdb to try to figure out what the hell movie "girls and sex" is (since it's listed as a new video release at the local cinebank), and i was finally able to locate it after going to www.cinebank.fr and clicking on the box cover - then searching imdb.com for "diana amft".  turns out that it's a german movie called "M�dchen, M�dchen" supposedly titled "girls on top" in english (which explains why i couldn't find it at first).  however, diana amft also starred in a movie titled (english translation)  urlLink "ants in the pants" .  i wouldn't have posted about this, except for the credits, where they list the following:  Tara Young (II)   ....   Sexy Krankenschwester  oooh baby, that's one sexy krankenschwester there!  (i had altavista translate it for me.  you should too.)

      among the more disturbing rumors i've heard lately: UR is trying to do away with D-Day.  they haven't hired any bands or even scheduled any on-campus musical acts (local a cappela, etc).  know word on whether or not there will be any carnival rides, but we'll see...  honestly, there'd be a bloody revolution of the student body if they attempt to eliminate D-Day.  in fact, i might just return to take part in it.  annnnd, i've mentioned politicalgraveyard.com and the magical link they put up to my site (technically only one guy runs it, but he finds it flattering to be referred to in the third person plural form).  not only has he visited my blog on multiple occasions, but he's even provided the first non-acquaintance comment.  it seems only fair to mention  urlLink "their" blog  in return: "Polygon, the Dancing Bear."  lastly, it's vacation time here in france, and i don't know if the university will be open during the next two-week period.  that may, unfortunately, mean that i will be unable to post until May.  we'll find out soon.

      what the hell are the french doing to "rock, paper, scissors"??  i had two of my students square off, and on the last exchange one of them tosses out "the well".  the  well ???  what in god's name is that?  according to them, both rock and scissors fall down the well (though paper covers it).  i'm sure my game theory professor would be horrified by this development.  on a more annoying note, amazon.fr is doing crazy things with my book-ordering.  i chose five books for delivery, all of which claimed to ship within 24 hours.  then, when i got the amazon "your account" page, one of them magically said "8-14 days."  so of course i said "screw that", since i wasn't about to have the four 24 hour books delayed by one 8-14 day book.  then suddenly after cancelling that part of the order, the other books all came up as "8-14 days" with one "unavailable."  i mean, wtf?  buuuuut, the "estimated delivery" is listed as 2-3 days from now...which is a lot shorter time than 2-3 weeks.  then the confirmation email i received for the original order showed  all  the books as 24 hours...including the one i had to cancel, which now actually  will  take the extra time (which i found out after re-ordering it).  so i had to re-cancel that book, and yet have not received email confirmation of that decision in spite of the fact that the damn thing no longer shows up on the "my account" page.  simply infuriating.  i don't have any idea when these things will be delivered, but i'm going to be pretty darn pissed if it's later - i picked these books expressly because they were immediately available and would therefore stave off vacation boredom.  i have no intentions of re-re-reading the sword of truth series again after doing a second reading of them last week.  and if i read one more time that "richard is a rare person" in the sword of truth series, i'm going to scream.  it's even more overused than deathstalker's "below the subconscious, past the backbrain, to the undermind."  ooh - and let's not forget "who but richard would think of making friends with (insert group name here)."  that one also bugs me.

       Two Days of Twice the Pleasure?   falling squarely in the category of "It's About Damn Time" comes  urlLink this  announcement from imdb.com.  honestly, ever since TNN started showing reruns of star trek: the next generation, the station has seemed as poorly named as the Utah Jazz and the LA Lakers.  and that crap about "The  New  TNN" just wasn't cutting it for me.  i wonder who took over in the last couple years, because obviously somebody in charge said "to hell with the female audience, they've got 'lifetime' and 'we' - we're only going to bother with the male audience now."  especially with programs such as "an animation block featuring  Stan Lee's Stripperella , starring Pamela Anderson."

      i went to the used bookstore for books in english, and it was even harder than normal to avoid porn or porn-like literature.  the problem is that the "policiers" have pictures of half-nude (or all-nude) women on the cover.  some of the women have guns, some have knives, some are in crosshairs, etc, but they're  all  in some state of undress.  next, you find the "romans espions," which are just like the policiers but a little more brazen...and they're located pretty much right nearby.  after that, there's a slight break with the sci-fi section (which is kinda bad, but not nearly on the same level) but then the OTHER side has romance novels and erotic literature (which have much more provocative covers, as you might imagine).  and here's the kicker - the table in the center is covered by secondhand playboys and penthouses and "new look" mags.  now - here are my issues with that.  first off, they're on a table at head-height for any kid who happens to walk by.  secondly, european playboys etc. are quite different than the US version (having never actually owned a playboy, i had to confirm this with a couple other people) in that you don't just find the nudity on the inside.  it's smack-dab on the cover.  so any of the aforementioned kiddies will get a nice introduction to ALL of shannon elizabeth.  and lastly, and perhaps most importantly, who wants to buy secondhand porn?  especially when you know what the first hand probably did with it...

      the Mr Friz excursion was among the more disappointing things that have happened to me lately - not because they sucked or because they were too good.  no, because i couldn't freakin' find them.  okay, so first off, i got on the wrong bus (fuckup number one goes to mike), but i managed to correct that error and arrive at the park not too atrociously late.  however, the fields were located in the middle of this gigunda park - and not only was the website map incredibly vague, but the park didn't have a single map posted anywhere in spite of the myriad of confusing/intersecting paths.  one of the most frustrating things was that you could see somewhere you wanted to go, and it might be only ten feet to the left but you wouldn't be able to get there because there'd be a giant ditch or a stream in your way.  which, of course, made my attempts to find the magical fields much more difficult.  at least there was cool wildlife and attractive athletic women to make the search more bearable.  i saw about a dozen rabbits, tons of ducks (including one in its nest in the middle of the reeds), some non-duck water fowl, a small furry mammal (actually, not that incredibly small.  larger than cat size.), and other random animals.  i'm really not sure what the small furry mammal  was , but rather than poke it and find out "hey, it's a badger!" i decided to leave the mystery be.  probably the best part was watching a duck hustle about five ducklings out of the way as i headed towards a low bridge (everybody down...low bridge 'cause we're coming to a town.  sorry - too much time in elementary school singing "the eerie canal").  and then when i stepped on it (the bridge, not the baby ducks you sickos), about five more ducklings shot out from underneath.  anyway, when i finally found the field, but there were no frisbee players on it.  rather, there were three soccer players on the adjacent field and a sign that said "field forbidden" on the place indicated on the map.  what sucks worst was that i'd seen people playing frisbee at the rennes campus as i walked to the park, but i didn't know them and had contacted Mr Friz, so i kept walking.  they were still there when i swung by on the return trip, but i was only able to watch.  Sum total: 2.5 hours of walking, zero hours of frisbee, 15 minutes of watching other people play frisbee.  further note - when writing "duckling," be careful not to write "fuckling."  (although i think "fuckling" is a stupendous term for a baby.)

      playing frisbee for the first time in months today with the Mr Friz rennes club team.  i'm hoping that the playing level is somewhere between intramural and college club team, that way i won't suck too hard at the beginning, and once i improve i'll be a decent contributor.  although today will be interesting since i slept in crappy one-hour increments for about 5 hours total.  furthermore, i was invited to dinner saturday night and decided not to decline, for once.  note to self: decline next time.  i mean, the food was good and the company was pretty good, but i only really knew one person and my french is total shit so it made for a difficult evening of conversation.  plus, i was the youngest person there by at least ten years.  shoulda just stayed home and read.

      there's  urlLink this  article on sportingnews.com.  it reveals that a woman is suing kenny anderson for not following up on certain financial promises between 1997 and 2000 (when she claims to have been his girlfriend).  The article also states: "She added that she stayed with the 32-year-old Anderson even though he was married, after he offered her $1 million to quit work and stay home to be available to him."  does this automatically put her in line for prosecution as a prostitute?  and what about kenny anderson for soliciting?  maybe she'll get around it because of the wording - "be available to him" could mean many things, after all.

      while i was heading into one of the main entrances to an on-campus building, i saw a couple girls putting on backpacks in a room just to the right of the entrance.  "huh," i thought to myself, "their class must have ended late, too."  at which point i realized, "hey - wait a minute...why is there a hand dryer on the wall behind them?"  followed by, "and what's with that random partition in the room, and why are there urinals on the other side of it?"  and ending with "oh crap, i've been staring into the girls' bathroom."  on the other hand, what the hell possessed the french to build a bathroom right next to a major traffic area and then install a gigantic picture window?  the minimal bathroom privacy they provide was too much?  they had to make it  more  awkward?

      From yahoo news: "Saddam Hussein's rule over the capital has ended, U.S. commanders declared Wednesday, and jubilant crowds swarmed into the streets here, dancing, looting and defacing images of the Iraqi leader. A Marine tank toppled a giant statue of Saddam in a sweeping, symbolic gesture. In the most visible sign of Saddam's evaporating power, the 40-foot statue of the Iraqi president was brought down in the middle of Firdos Square. Cheering Iraqis, some waving the national flag, scaled the statue and danced upon the downed icon, now lying face down. As it fell, some threw shoes and slippers at the statue � a gross insult in the Arab world."  does this article seem a trifle, ummmmm, biased to anyone else?  and how come when L.A. loots, it's a riot, but when people in iraq loot, it's "jubilant crowds"?  furthermore, why would people wave the national flag if they were happy with the situation?  if someone overthrew the u.s. government, i'm pretty sure that i wouldn't think "hey -maybe i can show my support for these new guys by frantically waving my old flag!"   urlLink Point/Counterpoint:  The "Brain Candy" Edition.

      The Already-Nude Principle:  france applies different standards to what they allow on tv.  as many of you already know, european tv programs often show nudity that would be censored in the states.  for example, the local equivalent of HBO, Canal+, shows hardcore pornography on the first saturday of every month.  yes, it  is  cable, but there would be an absolute uproar in the US if HBO did the same.  after all, even Skinemax shows a marginal amount of restraint.  however, network television best exhibits the difference in standards.  nypd blue might show someone's ass, but french tv will show pretty much everything.  dennis franz's buttocks at 9 pm are a far cry from random topless women in the midafternoon.  however, here's the kicker: french tv never seems to show women  removing  their clothes.  any time you see a pair of breasts on the screen, it's guaranteed to be right after a cut of some sort.  it's like "man...i can't help but feel like we're forgetting something here.  well, go ahead and shoot anyway, we'll figure it out.  whoops!  we forgot to put clothes on her!  ah damn.  i guess we're going to have to use this shot anyway.  shucks.  i  knew  we'd forgotten something.  don't worry, we'll remember next time!"

      random day:  someone's going to come over to do a "state of the place" thing for my apartment today.  apparently, some things in france ARE just like they are in the united states, as i will be expected to be in my apartment between the hours of 2 and 6 pm.  i finally found lemonade yesterday - and not the carbonated nonsense they try to pass off as lemonade here in france.  too bad it was "snapple classic" and cost 2 euros a bottle (same size as snapple bottles at home, so we're not talking a 2-liter bottle here).  still looking into the mr. friz ultimate team now that the warmer weather has arrived and they're no longer playing in a gym.  i guess i partly admire their dedication to play, but that feeling is coupled with horror at their decision to play in a school gym somewhere - how can you lay-out on a wooden floor?  why do so many atheletes have amazing performances when suffering from "flu-like symptoms."  it seems most common in basketball, but it happens all the damn time - even in golf (tiger woods just won his last tournament by eleven strokes...in spite of constant vomiting on the course).  i can just see the gm's now: "okay, before Kobe's next game we'll infect him with the ebola virus - he'll score 300!"  in five boxes of apple minis, i've gotten three Shere Khans.  admittedly cool, but i'd like a Baloo please.  and i consumed an entire jar of cheese salsa yesterday.  in one sitting.  yum.

      playing word games in oral expression classes?  great idea!  i can't believe it took me this long to think of doing that game where each person gives their name and then names a food (or whatever type of item you choose) that starts with the same letter.  then as you go around the circle, each student has to repeat every single name/item combo given up to that point.  sure, it's a lame-o RA icebreaker, but it sure as heck worked better than anything else at getting the young'uns to speak.  besides,  they  didn't even know all their classmates' names either (and this after half a semester working together in small groups).  i no longer feel guilty for not learning every kid's name in the other two groups.

      this dude walked up to me and asked me "excuse me, young man, do you speak english?" and i inexplicably answered "oui."  even more strangely, i paid careful attention to the sign he had written describing his problem.  i guess that wouldn't be strange except that he had written it in french and was already recounting his difficulty in english, and yet i felt compelled to follow along as he pointed at each of the words.  maybe i'm simply trained to look at things with a thoughtful expression when people gesture at them.  it's probably the most valuable social skill i learned at college - feigning interest convincingly, that is.  no new point/counterpoint today (though i've reposted "Kitten").  i mean, i like doing them, but i get the feeling that i'm not exactly disappointing a vast loyal following here.

      two conditions that when combined become a problem:  condition one: there are a large number of people standing at strategic locations handing out fliers.  condition two: there are many fewer trash containers than are found in the united states.  separately, neither of these matter very much, but together they turn into a bit of an annoyance.  every day, you're virtually guaranteed to collect at least three useless advertisements.  however, given the dearth of trash receptacles, you end up holding onto those ads for irritating lengths of time.  if rennes were either to cut down on the number of Strategically Placed People or increase the number of trash bins, then this issue would be miraculously solved.  so vote Mike/Kael Anderson for Mayor!

      damnit - the red sox got a raw deal to start the season.  if they win, then they beat the  devil rays , which is effectively the same as beating up a 6th grader.  but if they lose...  of course, i would have much preferred the option of having the red sox pummel that 6th grader, but hey, you can't have everything.  and happy april fool's day - already had a "poisson d'avril" today.  (a fire alarm.  laaaaaaaaaaame.)  oh yeah, and the lemon tart turned out pretty good, the flan was/is great, and i'll let you know how the apple crumble is after it cools.

      and here are the point/counterpoints:   point:  where did you learn this?  counterpoint:  i learned it by watching  you !   point:  actually, the color of the drug in it's non-synthesized state is sort of a light blue-ish hue.  counterpoint:  right, so orange it is?   point:   (insert here)  counterpoint:   that's what she said...   point:  (marge) coffee!  counterpoint:  (crocodile dundee?) be-er?   point:  some people just can't take a joke.  counterpoint:   you  shot  me, you jackass!  couple others that don't seem as good, but maybe i'll do 'em up later.  either email me your take on one (or two) of these, or vote on which one you want and i'll set aside enough time to do it.

      dinard yesterday was a lot of fun - i'm not normally a fan of going to the beach, but i'd been stuck in rennes for a little too long and it was unpleasantly hot in the city.  it was so much cooler on the beach and ben, alice, and i spent the entire day there (left at 1 pm from rennes and got back at midnight).  it was a bit bright, so my eyes got a little bugged and i managed to burn in spite of my keen sense of shade, but it was pretty rad (that one's for you, eric).  apparently, there are no public decency laws in france so lots of the women were sunbathing topless.  personally, however, i would be happier if there WERE such laws because the majority of the topless women were old husky grandmothers.  "my eyes!  ze goggles - zey do  nussing !"  on a different note, check out  urlLink stacey pressman  on espn's page2.  just seems like she'd be really cool to hang out with - probably to date as well (since that's the subject of her articles thus far), but since i'll probably be totally outclassed by the competition i'd settle for duking it out on 'contra' with her.

      and a couple random things to tide you over until tomorrow's Big Music Post (TM) (in addition to a couple things i haven't been able to squeeze in yet without making the daily postings overlong.  i'm limiting myself to two per day.)  firstly, i appear to look 19 or younger, given that the metro people were handing out "Carte 'Jeune Libert�'" flyers and went out of their way on two occasions to give me one.  thing is, the card only applies to people under the age of 20...  too bad they missed me by three and a half years.  ben, on the other hand, had them stop in the process of giving him a flyer and say "wait, you're too old for this.  it doesn't matter to  you .  however, if they're still giving me these handouts in about 5 years, i'll probably be fairly pleased.  secondly, for a variety of reasons (mostly tied up in my somewhat limited access to the internet), i am having trouble keeping up with the point/counterpoint.  i have at least 5 tandems ready for development, but i don't have time to write out the arguments for each side.  maybe i'll write them out at home and then just copy them over at some point, but i'm pretty close to just posting the ideas here and asking people to submit a response via email.  audience participation!  point/counterpoint starring  you , the viewer!  and lastly, if they ever start posting "envelope porn" on the internet ('the FINEST in envelope-licking'), the first person they contact should be on of the girls from the exam i had to monitor.  in france, you're required to seal the upper-right corner of your exam booklet in order to keep your name secret while the professors are grading your test; this one girl just had waaaaaaaaay too good a time sealing hers.  it just wasn't right.  in fact, it was wrong.  very very wrong.

      music day today:  first up, more fun with french radio.  there's not much more disturbing than hearing someone cover "House of the Rising Sun"...in french.  the french version of "california dreaming" comes close, however.  still, it's a step up from their english offerings.  "we will rock you" as performed by The Annoying Children's Tabernacle makes me want to stab someone.  on the other hand, i almost busted a nut laughing when that "short short man" song came on.  itty bitty, teeny weeny, shriveled little short-short man---           (don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want no) itty bitty, teeny weeny, shriveled little short-short man---           (don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want no)  probably gonna get some karmic backlash from my amusement, but hey.

      and i think i can one-up colin's "he ended up in the hall.  you know...to get away from the sharks" story.  because last night i ended up in the hall (which requires unlocking my door with my keys) in order to escape the super-intelligent snake that had decided to kill me.  now normally, once i get into the hall i realize that there are  no  swarms of bees,  no  grenades being lobbed through the window,  no  giant spiders in my bed, etc.  unfortunately last night, my stunning hall realization wasn't "you're doing it again.  go back to bed, dumbass."  nay, it was "i can't escape without at least a pair of shoes!!!"  so i scooted back into the apartment, ducked into the bathroom and threw the door closed, and then attempted not to have a heart attack for a bit.  sadly, as soon as i realized that maybe the super-intelligent homicidal snake could get under the door, the whole "calming down" process came to an abrupt end.  i think i came back to reality just as i was preparing to wedge the bathmat under the door, but at that point i had so much adrenaline pumping through my body that it took another 15-20 minutes before i reached a level where i was fairly certain i wasn't going to hurl my guts out.  indiana jones i ain't, but even he can't stand  regular  snakes, let alone super-intelligent hell-bent on evil ones.  i have two other posts i want to make, but that would be just way too much for today so i'll leave them until tomorrow.

      The band thus far:   Name:  Hard of Herring   Talentless Lead Singer:  Samay Gheewala - in the tradition of David Lee Roth, Axl Rose, etc.  (his description, not mine)   Talentless Lead Guitar and Backup Vocals:  Kael Anderson   Rhythm Guitar and/or...Drums?:  Sandeep Raghow - could probably switch over to lead guitar.   Talentless Bass Player:  Joe Collins - he sucks...mainly because he's never really played bass before, but he's worked out some Stone Temple Pilots basslines and that's good enough for me.   Sexy Backup Dancer:  Vijay Sookdeo -  � la  Carmen Electra  personally, i think we need to work in eric lee (on violin?  probably better doing mixing and electronic stuff.  he's actually talent ed  on the violin, so that just wouldn't fit at all), and isa loundon - but isa would leave us with a talent problem again.  mainly, she's got some.  now we just need to acquire some sort of "mission from god" and we're alllllll set.

      why doesn't PETA freak out about those people who cover themselves with bees for tv shows?  for that matter, are vegans allowed to eat honey?  it's high time someone led a crusade protecting against the exploitation of our tiny apiary friends.  i can see the slogan now: "Honey Lovers - Buzz Off!"  (keep in mind, slogans of this type are usually lame.  i'm merely following tradition.)

      i can't figure out why Natalie Imbruglia's "Torn" is getting played all the time on french top40 radio these days.  the song's probably five years old at this point.  on another note, if i see one more couple making out in broad daylight (at bus stops, on the metro, walking the sidewalks, standing in line for movie theaters, etc), i'm going to punch someone in the face.  it's really rather sickening and i've taken to yelling "GET A FUCKING ROOM" in english whenever i see it.  JFC (tip of the cap to joe on that one), keep it private!  maybe i can train myself to projectile vomit on them instead.  after all, it makes me want to retch anyway.

      more protests yesterday, and several of the department members are "on strike."  they're still giving exams and classes, which confuses me a little, but they're doing their best to make a strong point.  i think one of them suggested that having to postpone exams until later in the year would just create a whole lot of headaches, so they've decided to finish out the semester.  i also completely forgot about the franco-american institute book sale.  there's more to the story, but i'll just leave you with the best part: i chose two books and brought them to the counter.  the guy there asked for two euros, and since i had only a ten-euro bill, i handed him the bill.  he looks at it.  looks at me.  looks back at the bill.  i offer to go buy groceries and come back later with a two-euro piece.  he says no.  opens a drawer.  looks under a folder in the drawer.  swivels in his chair and gazes at the desk.  looks back under the folder.  calls out to one of the people there and asks if they have change.  looks under the folder yet again.  reluctantly pulls out some kind of change-purse.  removes a 5-euro bill and a 2-euro piece.  hands them to me saying "eight."  i and my copious math skills wait for the remaining one-euro piece.  counter-guy notices me waiting patiently.  counter-guy tells me: "just take another one" in this tone of voice that explicitly makes it sound as though he's doing me a favor or letting me take a free book or something.  i seriously wanted to give him a verbal beatdown at that point, adding that "no!  don't make it sound like you're doing me a freakin' favor by letting me take another book!  i'm doing  you  a favor by not insisting that you give me my goddamn money, you bastard."

      the NBA just finished passing out awards, so it's time to dish out some hardware for the blog crew.   MVP:   Eric Lee - was there really any other choice?  between setting up the template, adding the comments and tracker features, posting while i'm away, and lots more, he's the clear-cut choice to win this award.   Coach of the Year:   Joe Collins - excellent advice and good evaluation of blog entries.  Solid guiding force in blogdom.   Defensive Player of the Year:   Colin Girgenti - the quickly-deleted "i don't eat kittens" post and the momentary boycott of blogs puts him over the edge to a runaway victory in this category.   Rookie of the Year:   Ben Gross - Hit the rookie wall and slumped during final exams time, but bounced back for the stretch run to make crucial blog-enriching contributions from the "comments" venue.   Most Improved:   Matt Woodruff - Breakout performance for evil twins everywhere.   Notable Snub:   Samay Gheewala - who also drops to a  D-  in "Procrastination for Fun and Profit."

      just got back from the last oral expression class for one of my groups.  i had them do skits for the last day, and holy crap was that entertaining.  just to give you an idea, one group did a game show where the grand prize was "a night with mike."  also, one of them snapped a photo of my long-haired, unshaven self and said she's going to put it on her website.  i'm pretty sure i'll come out looking like a total fatass slob, so it'll be interesting to see what it ends up looking like on her homepage.

      i realize the theme has strayed away from "french" lately, so let's get back on target at least for today.  three classes left and then i'm done with my teaching career at rennes.  right now they're finishing up final lab exams, and i'm damn glad of that.  especially since the new person in charge of first-year labs and i differ so much in our assessments of the students.  it's really kind of ridiculous just how much, in fact.  for example, there were at least three students today that i thought deserved an 11/20 (putting them in the top quarter), and in each case she wanted to give the student a 7/20 (the bottom quarter).  it's rather mystifying when the professor/head honcho slashes points wholesale for things that seem incredibly minor to you...or completely non-existent.  i guess my ear's just not trained in the same way...  besides, i have no prior experience in these matters, so i should probably defer to her.  actually, now that i think about it, i may not even have classes tomorrow; there are rumors that the university will be on strike.  given that there have been 4 major protests/strikes in rennes over the last week and a half, i wouldn't be surprised at all.  and i think that eric wins the prize for quote of the week:  "any time i'm laughing uncontrollably, i realize in the back of my head that somebody's probably deeply offended."

      couple non-spoiler things about the matrix:  monica belluci has received more publicity here in europe for her role in the movie than all the other cast members combined...and appears for, at most, ten minutes.    secondly, who's trying to sell stock in "carrie-anne moss is the hottest woman on the planet"?  because frankly, i'm not buying.  as promised a while back, here's the x-men 2 mini-spoiler: why the heck would mystique want to get with wolverine?  i mean, he  stabbed  her in the last movie and left her for dead.  was it admiration for his detective skills in the first film?  was it just because she was super-attracted to him?  was it cruelty/trickery?  i guess the last one would make sense because of the sowing of general mayhem among the x-men.  but - be honest - weren't some of you rooting for wolverine to just say "screw it, close enough"?  well, maybe not quite that, but perhaps some sort of romantic relationship starting up between wolverine and mystique-as-mystique?  heck, he might even bring her over to the good team.

      just got back from seeing the Matrix Reloaded and i just want to say "wow."'  as in, "wow, was that a big fat disappointment."  i think i'll watch x-men 2 again to take the sting off.  by the way, anyone who's read the Deathstalker series will notice a blatant plot ripoff (though simon green may have ripped it off from someone else, for all i know) involving one of Mr Smith's new abilities.

      which morphological synergistic kids series did  you  like best?  Power Rangers:  (i can't remember if they could power up individually, but they could combine to form that giant Mecha-Ranger)  Voltron:  (also don't recall individual abilities, but yet another example of coming together to form an �ber-being)  Thundercats:  (Thundercats, unite!)  Transformers:  (more than meets the eye)  Dinosaucers:  (they had those cool rings that could transform them into raging dinosaurs.  no group stuff though, strictly individual basis.)  Dragon Ball Z:  (didn't want to put them on here, but they can power up individually AND sometimes meld with one another, so i kinda had to.)  this is kinda easy for me - i never watched any of them except for Dinosaucers and Dragon Ball Z (though i've heard good things about thundercats).  plus, dragon ball z just doesn't feel the same as the rest of them.  the characters develope their abilities through training whereas in all the other series, each character has a small set of innate and immutable traits.  so yeah, go  urlLink Dinosaucers!  (imdb.com)  and apparently GoBots never got their own tv series or movie.  they got so shafted.

      a helluva long time ago, eric asked me to come up with a "List of Five" � la "Seinfeld"...at least, i  think  it was based on seinfeld.  anyway, he asked me to come up with this list, and i'm really bugged that i appear to be utterly incapable of doing so.  as it stands right now, it's a "list of one" and the one really angers me.  it feels similar to those times when you're picking a team and you choose someone you really hate because you grudgingly have to admit that they're your best option.  it's like selecting barry bonds for your fantasy-league roster.

         lots of fun, but what's left after you find all 96 exits and collect all the dragon coins?  how long will the fun last before you simply get nothing more out of the game?  maybe i should go back and beat all the levels with luigi.  then again, quite frankly, luigi sucks.  he sucked in Mario 2 (he could jump a tiny bit higher than his brother, but if you cared about jumping you obviously had to pick the princess), and he sucked in Luigi's Mansion.  heck, even in Super Smash Bros/Melee he's just a crappier version of mario.  the only time he had a chance to not-suck was when he was played by John Leguizamo in the Super Mario Bros movie...but then the  film  sucked.  he's like the roger clinton of the video game world.     (super mario world box cover located on gamespot.com, roger clinton appears courtesy of http://www.korea-np.co.jp/pk/ and sony records)

      don't you love how you can fall dead asleep fully clothed at 10 pm, but when you wake up in a puddle of your own drool at 10:30, change, brush your teeth, and get to bed sometime before 11, you find yourself completely incapable of falling asleep until 4 in the morning?  yeah, me neither.  i also made the critical mistake of mocking the "wussy french spiders" sometime at the beginning of the year.  the comment has since come back to haunt me, as i have been beset by some of the biggest goddamn spiders i have ever seen in my life.  last night, for example, i splattered one just inside the bathroom.  i would write "squished", but that would not be an accurate assessment of the situation.  "squished" sounds relatively clean and sterile whereas Arachnor the Spider apparently was competing for the title of "juiciest spider alive."  when i tried to pick up the carcass and throw it out, i ended up smearing a distressing amount of green ooze all over the floor.  i really regret making the observation about the inherent wussiness of french spiders, or at the very least, doing so out loud.

      National Strike Day in france today.  annoying as all getout - had to walk to the university twice.  and the franco-american institute was also shut down (which, of course, included their book sale).  ooh, and best of all, the post office was closed too...kind of.  you could use the automatic machines, but the counter area was roped off with some bouncer woman keeping everyone from crossing - it was like the Maginot Line...only it worked.  oh yeah, and for no apparent reason, there was a woman sitting behind one of the counters attentively waiting for customers by all appearances.  wtf?  and remember when chris interrupts the bris in Brain Candy?  yeah, i don't know why but i've been substituing the french word for strike (gr�ve) into don's bris-talk.  all freakin' day it's been: "hi chris, we're having a gr�ve here - can this wait?  we're in the middle of a gr�ve...?  we're gr�ve-ing...?"  of course, not even the other lecteurs have seen the movie, so i'm s.o.l.  and to top it all off, it hailed.

      holy shnikes, it's getting suckier and suckier to be a kid these days.  why?  check out  urlLink this article  on yahoo.com.  no oreos?  nooooooooo!  i still remember how in elementary school chris sillari and nick shapiro tried to set some kind of guiness world record for "biggest oreo."  basically, they bought about a bazillion oreo "big stuffs" and then cut the white filling out of all but two of them (from which they removed one chocolate side) and then slapped it all together into a Mecha-Oreo: The Monster Cookie.  plus, is this a figment of my imagination, or did nabisco release jars of "Stuff", the white oreo filling?  also, my blender makes me think of spinal tap sometimes.  specifically, the speed settings do.  remember how i wrote that "it has three speeds.  0, 1, and....2" ?  well, for the past couple days, this keeps running through my mind: "let's say it's time to blend, and you're blending, you're blending, you're blending, and you're blending and 1 just isn't enough?  well, this one goes to 2.  very rare that - had to have it specially made."  also, upon reflection, i have decided to alter some of the procrastination grades.  Joe Collins receives an  A- , but it's one of those weasel A-'s which are really B+'s in disguise.  And Samay Gheewala receives a  D .  And although not truly an alteration, Matt Woodruff receives a nepotism-induced A.  (for contributions to Evil Twindom).  think of it like those "honorary doctorates" that colleges are always handing out at this time of the year.

      received my Official Rejection Letter from the caf today.  i wish the explanation given hadn't been a blatant lie about how i make too much money per month - two of the other lecteurs earn the exact same amount per month (and have 2001 income declared) and neither of them got screwed.  ah well.  i also saw a study recently that said americans don't feel they're "grown up" until 26 (26.2 to be precise).  seems about right to me, but i wonder about other stuff such as if there's an age beyond which making out just doesn't happen anymore.  i mean, is there an age with no making out middle ground where people either have sex or don't have sex?  where if you  start  making out with someone, you know it's going to lead to sex?  i'm not so sure i'm a fan of that age.  furthermore, i appear to have reached the age where friends throw dinner parties on their birthday.  does that mean i'm starting to get old?  probably not, since i'm not "grown up" yet.

      i picked up one of those walkman-style FM radios and the thing kicks ass.  great reception, auto-scan, cheap as all hell, and really small.  i is pleased.  and they're plugging lipton ice tea like mad over here.  you see it everywhere in the stores, nowadays, and it's usually on some kind of promotion.  in addition, they sent squads of lipton ice tea goons to the university to accost thousands of helpless students into trying free samples of their crappy product.  sorry, that's my anti-ice tea bias coming through augmented by my distaste for people who accost me in order to shamelessly plug a product of some kind.  leave me the hell alone, i say.  you and your annoying yellow lipton ice tea vests and your supersoaker-esque backpacks of ice tea (you all remember the supersoaker that had the quarter-inch stream?  the one with the backpack water supply and the clear plastic tubing that you had to hook into the gun?  yeah, like that) can go suck it.  i is not pleased.  AND THE CAF REJECTED MY APPLICATION YET AGAIN.  I IS  EXTREMELY  NOT PLEASED.

      jennifer brought me Country Time Lemonade (powdered version) when she came back from the U.S.!  I have since professed my undying love.  she also inexplicably apologized for not bringing back several other things she had  intended  to get me but did not have enough room for.  basically, she's trying to apologize for not getting me  enough  free stuff.  wtf?  this seems to suggest that i have a reputation for being a giant ingrate who scoffs at gifts he deems "unworthy".

      I'm handing out grades for the imaginary course "Procrastination for Fun and Profit"  Eric Lee:   A-   Known to work at times (which accounts for the minus), but better known for his dedication to video games, internet browsing, football, softball, and spending way too much money on romantic comedies.  Colin Girgenti:   B+   High level of slacking, but somewhat lacking in the "wow - i sure pulled that one out of my ass"-quality that separates the A's from the B's.  Joe Collins:   B   Bullshits with the best of them, but prone to spending just that little bit too much time working for my liking.  Samay Gheewala:   C   Simply doesn't get away with it.  Procrastinates for  too  long and thereby incurs professorial ill-will.  However, he garners a gentleman's C for his "deadlines are really just 'suggestions' " philosophy.  Benjamin Gross:   F   Procrastination?  What's that?  I'm sorry, I've been working on this paper that isn't due for another two weeks and I wasn't paying attention to your distracting ramblings.  Unfortunately, I'm not qualified to grade anyone else who visits the blog with any regularity (sorry, matt.  would you like an A for being the evil twin?  it could be arranged...), so we'll call it a day and scoot.

      did you know that "Jerry Springer: The Opera" is playing in London?  ...did you know that it's playing to "rave reviews"?  the chipmunks still have not done anything, and the building will be closed tomorrow, so i won't be able to check again until friday (presuming, of course, that the university doesn't shut down until monday like it did  last  week).  of course, that means no blog post tomorrow...  i'll email eric a couple posts just in case they screw me over until monday, but i think y'all can handle one day without my particular brand of insanity.

      i don't know how, but i managed to hold off purchasing a hawaiian shirt for 20 euros.  i'm gonna give myself a pat on the back.  heck, maybe i even earned myself a little gift.  i think a hawaiian shirt would be an adequate choice, don't you?  i finally got a viable reason to cut my hair - one of my male students confided in me (while stoned) that several of the girls in my oral expression class think i look like Dawson.  maybe  he  thinks that's a good thing, but james van der beek is a total dorfwang and i'd like to resemble him as little as possible.  okay, i'm going to say it - Kelly Hu has really ugly hands.  now it's off to see if the CAF has finally stopped prochainement-ing the �tudi� of my dossier...

      holy crapola, batman!  i signed onto this computer and the people at CRI have mysteriously restored a bunch of my files that they deleted...months ago.  this is almost like the unexpected reappearance of my sweatshirt.  maybe it means i can use internet explorer, but it's only on the other two (occupied) computers here.  can't wait to check...  anyway, i saw x-men 2 on friday (sooooooooo good.  so good.), which means that today's post is movie-related (but no spoilers until at least a week from now).  first off: methos!  yes, indeed, that  was  peter wingfield of "highlander: the series" fame.  sweeeet.  and now to matrix reloaded stuff.  i don't have a TV and hadn't seen a movie in months, so i was pretty darn pleased when they showed the matrix preview before the x-men movie.  looks really cool, but it's got a lot to live up to after the spectacularly solid showing x-men made.  my friend vijay mentioned certain new bad dudes who "look like blond rastafarians" - personally, i think they look more like the Predator without mandibles, but they seem like they'll be a damn good enemy.  plus, after seeing the preview, i think we should all thank keanu reeves for ditching a buttload of money to save the film.  from what i remember, they were going to run out of money before he offered to waive his percentage of the box office.  three cheers.  they also showed a preview for 2 Fast 2 Furious and i gotta say that it looks like nothing but eye candy (both girls and cars).  i really doubt there will be any plot or acting value to this movie at all, but it has a chance of becoming the "MTV's Undressed" of the big screen - sucking in viewers through sheer trashiness.  and finally (and perhaps most importantly), one of the cinemas here will be showing Evil Dead.   Evil Dead !!!  i mean, what the hell?  it's not even a crap-cinema, either - it's one of the two big ones in the city.  i'm really not sure what this says about france.  is it good?  is it bad?  will they be showing Evil Dead 2 soon?  just, wow.  (and for about a week, i've randomly busted out yelling  CINQO DE MAYO ! ...which may or may not be spelled like that.  how should i know?  i majored in french, for cryin' out loud.)

       proxy mike 2 note to self: don't wear shorts to the university again.  basically, i want to avoid any situation where the secretary, Franck, pauses on his way out of the department to yank on my leg hair...while giggling.  either that or it's time to get some 'nair' or something.  and secondly, the security people here at school must hate me.  or perhaps they hate "that mysterious person who keeps setting off the alarms after we close up the building."  to which i respond, "it's your own damn fault for closing the buildings early, you dorfwangs."

      right, so the whole "jennifer's letting me borrow her tv while she's in toulouse" thing didn't go according to plan.  somehow, where she gets 6.5 channels (canal+ comes in half the time), i  sort of  get one.  we're going to try setting the tv up in her new apartment, though, and if more channels come in, she's going to let me borrow the keys while she's gone.  the actual "watching tv" part of having a tv isn't really all that important, though i must admit it's oddly intriguing watching american programs in french.  mainly, i was thinking of picking up a super nintendo for around 20 bucks and then snagging some el cheapo games (street fighter II, here i come).  so even if no channels come in, the AV option will be jimdandy.  on another note, on my one semi-channel, i got to watch this show called "Nice People" where a mysterious Mr. Nice gives members of a household different tasks to do each day - and every week people get chucked out of the house.  it's like big brother, except that the "cast" consists entirely of foreigners from around europe who speak french.  similar to big brother, however, the show sucks.  Mr. Nice makes them do things like "go outside in full eskimo attire until 4:30 PM"...while it's 92� outside.  and there was no chance of redemption after the one contestant i wanted to ax-murder was the first person selected as a finalist.  horrid show.  and now it's off for a big day of sending a certified "i'm moving" letter and then helping jennifer move.

      and how about them red sox?  25-8 win, 10 runs in the first inning before recording an out, 28 hits...  i guess the only shocking thing was that nomar only went 1-4 (he got a break midway through the game, so that's why he only had 4 AB's) in a game when the sox batted .608 as a team.  plus, i may have been a bit premature in saying that the celts screwed up the draft.  we'll wait and see.

      somewhat sore today for no apparent reason.  oh wait, there was that whole "helping ben move" thing yesterday.  got a cactus and a cd rack out of it though - whoo hoo!  and a full-sized ironing board, but that's for jennifer (since i picked up an iron from the  last  person who moved out).  and on monday, i'm helping another person move (jennifer), but this time it'll involve lugging stuff across part of the city and not just taking it downstairs to a waiting car.  but hey, she's gonna let me borrow her TV for the summer - double whoo hoo!  that'll make my books last a little longer.  since i'm reading them all for the second (or third) time, the tv will help me stave off finishing the novels too quickly.

      hey, check it out -  urlLink samay  has a blog.  and the celts managed to screw up the draft yet again - what are they, the new clippers?  (only in drafting sense, however.  though, come to think of it, if they were out west...)  the Quest for Pants continues with no end in sight.  mostly because the Bigass Market the other day was a fair representation of the actual proportion of men's clothes to women's clothes.  my options are severely limited.  ran around the track for a bit after my morning post.  almost made myself sick.  but that's mainly due to my idiocy of running on four hours sleep after helping a friend move and not drinking any water.  (plus, the whole "i haven't run since last august" thing i've got going for me.)  the talking heads are cool.  tina weymouth is also pretty amusing.  discussing Al Green's "take me to the river" (some paraphrasing): "it combines teenage lust with baptism ... All praise the mighty spurtin' Jesus."  she also thanks the band for not choosing someone taller to play bass.  shoot, there was something else.  can't for the life of me remember.  drat.

      okay, i just found out that the building closes at 8 today instead of 10, so i only have ten minutes.  damnit.  right - so there was a giant market yesterday in which they closed down every street in the center of town to make room for all the vendors.  unfortunately, more than 90% of the goods for sale were intended for women, so it was a big fat bust for me.  secondly, a couple months ago i told my parents about ryanair.com.  yesterday, i received a letter from my mom saying "i was researching ways to travel through europe, and i just found this airline called 'ryanair.com!'"  ummmmmm....thanks?

      horoscopes!   Aries  (March 21 - April 19): Bill Clinton will ask to be your running mate in 2004, which you think is kinda nice until you discover his elaborate plot to assassinate you just after the inauguration.   Taurus  (April 20 - May 20): Okay, so your script for "Planet of the Humans" is frankly derivative, but it's really not all that bad for a rhesus monkey.   Gemini  (May 21 - June 21): You will soon find true love.  In other news, make sure you don't miss next week's Farming and Livestock Convention.   Cancer  (June 22 - July 22): Jupiter enters your house and stays on the couch for a few weeks.   Leo  (July 23 - August 22): Your desperate efforts to save the woman you love will inspire future generations to new heights of laughter.   Virgo  (August 23 - September 22): All your problems will be solved in a half-hour of whacky sitcom antics, after which everything fades to black.   Libra  (September 23 - October 23): Your friends will be mystified by your inexplicable insistence that the machine gun is superior to the spread fire in "Contra."   Scorpio  (October 24 - November 21): The stars point to many things, but even they're not sure what you were planning to do with a porcupine, a roll of duct tape, and a copy of "Gymkata."   Sagittarius  (November 22 - December 21): You will never look at "Wayne's World" in quite the same way after an unfortunate incident in which several dozen monkeys do, indeed, fly out of your butt.   Capricorn  (December 22 - January 19): They say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but that doesn't make your collection of human eyeballs any less disturbing.   Aquarius  (January 20 - February 18): Signs indicate that this is a bad week for change in the workplace, but since you're a ring-tailed lemur, your alternatives weren't all that exciting anyway.   Pisces  (February 19 - March 20): Yes, you passed a camel through the eye of a needle, but everyone agrees that your use of an oversized blender was cheating.

      okay, the phone thing - obviously this didn't come off as i intended it; sorry about that.  what was meant as a  urlLink "barry and levon" -style "awwwwwww yeah"-feel at the end, evidently turned into an eeyore-esque tone.  my bad.  considering that you all read my blog (or i read yours) and talk via email, i didn't think y'all would take it as an attack on you.  i mean, what else can i say on the phone that hasn't been written on this page already?  you probably have more to contribute than the miscellaneous things i pick up from comments, emails, blogs, etc. but that's putting way too much pressure on someone else to carry an entire conversation.  5 of the 7 non-france people don't even have the blog address, and one of the remaining two has visited once or possibly twice.  even if the posting had been meant as an indictment of some sort, there's  no way  it could've been aimed at any of you - it would be the rest of the non-readers incurring my wrath.  on the other hand, i think that some of my irritation at certain email delinquents (3 in particular, and none of them are you) probably leaked into my blog.  which means that beneath my ill-fated attempt at humor was an undercurrent of annoyance at something else entirely.  so my bad.

      F�te de la Musique was awesome.  crappy - but enthusiastic - bands everywhere.  people thronging the streets to the point that you could barely move.  vendors selling all sorts of foods.  bbq's.  soooo fun.  didn't get nearly as drunk as i intended (well, didn't get drunk at all), but i still had a great time.  by the way, cotton candy is called "barbe papa" (papa's beard).  weird, eh?  F�te du Cinema is also going on now - one full-fare entry gets you unlimited 1.50 viewings until the last showing on tuesday.  okay, technically you're limited by time, but i only mention that to stave off the nitpickers.  oh yeah, and some ass-monkey left gum on my seat at one of the films - and of course i'd worn the pants i washed on the previous day.  freakin' tool.  and although yesterday had reasonable lines, today's have been ungodly.  i'm actually going to go buy my ticket for the next movie now...and hour early.  that way i can come back and just waltz straight on past the line when it's time for the showing.

      furthermore, tomorrow is D-Day: Rennes (F�te de la Musique), so i won't be coming in tomorrow to post.  i'll also most likely be drunk off my ass the entire day.  therefore, i'll give you something on which to ponder and provide feedback during the weekend:  ben has connections with the onion...what should i do with this knowledge?  hell, of course i'd love to write for them, but these are the people who make me laugh out loud every single week and think "man, i wish i could write stuff like that."  ergo, the whole "mike writing for the onion" thing seems patently unrealistic.  however, since it's harder to gauge one's own writing i'm asking for objective feedback from you, the viewer, as to how you think i should approach this.  if you want, i'll write up some onion-ified horoscopes so you have more material to consider.    all righty, that's it for the week - back on monday (provided the university computers are functioning properly).

      three things happened today worth mentioning:  first off, i had a bit of the epiphany in that i realized i'm the derrick coleman of the academic world - putting up good numbers on little effort while other people lament the waste of potential.  i guess i'm not just a procrastinator, but an underachiever as well.  secondly, some kid asked me for a light while i was walking home from the laundromat.  my first thought: "hey, that's a funny-lookin' cigarette."  second thought: "wait a minute, that's no cigarette.  that's the whacky-tobaccy."  third thought (five minutes later): "it's 4:25 now, so my laundry will be dry in - - - hold the phone..."  lastly, and perhaps most importantly, some girl about my age deliberately crossed the street to avoid walking past me - i mean, it wasn't even subtle.  blatant attempt to stay as far away from me as possible.  yeah,  that  made my day.  (note the dripping sarcasm).  it's also a huge and unexpected shift.  at what point did i go from "the nice guy that girls feel safe around at all times" to "the creepy guy that girls cross the street to avoid" ?  and at when, if ever, do i become "the hot guy that girls want to spend the night with on sight" ?

      the computer people here at university of rennes 2 and the french postal service can both collectively fuck off and die.  the postal service appears to be deliberately delaying the delivery of items (just noticed the alliteration...sorry about that) in an effort to support the "mouvement sociale" against the retirement re-organization.  CRI (the computer people), managed to "fix" the problem from monday such that i could sign onto the system...but the system couldn't connect me to anything.  which is weird, because everything was working just  fine  on tuesday.  so damn annoying.

      actually, this was a pretty busy weekend.  there was a fairly large musical fest in the city on saturday - lots of conflicting music though.  put it this way: at the top end of one of the squares there was a long line of men in women in traditional Breton costume doing some kind of traditional Breton dance/parade.  then in the middle of the square, you had the "gay pride" section with a little platform/truck blasting techno music while surrounded by drag queens and people waving flags.  and from somewhere  else  in the square, you could hear the old woman who apparently goes to every single retirement funds protest and sings the same damn song.  oh yeah, and some dude had put an inflatable raft in the fountain near my apartment building and was towing people around in circles.  and to think,  next  week is the BIG music fest.  it's gonna be D-Day: France!  ummmmm - wait a second...  (stupid UR, trying to cancel D-Day.  grrrr...)

      so i'm back after yet another annoying screwup by the computer people here.  i got in yesterday to check my email, etc. and when i tried to sign on, i got this error message that "your itinerant profile is not available.  we'll try to connect you to one registered locally."  unfortunately, the "local profile" wouldn't let me do  anything  since the system assumed i wasn't authorized.  nyargh.  what made it doubly-annoying was that i wanted to order a couple things for my parents.  well, i'm back now, so all's good i guess.

       Area Man Wants To Know When The Hell The Onion's Going To Get In Contact With Him   Simsbury, CT -- Area resident Mikael Anderson, 23, a former English-language assistant in France, wants to know just what in the hell is keeping the satirical paper "The Onion" from getting in touch with him.  "I don't know what's keeping them, but it's about damn time they got a hold of me," Anderson said.  "I mean, c'mon!  Some of this stuff is pure genius; I can't imagine what's causing the delay."  Anderson further argued that his two blogs (rennes.blogspot.com and pointcounterpoint.blogspot.com) have more than adequately demonstrated his ability to write for the popular weekly issue, adding that he's "not going to wait on them forever."  Sources at the offices of The Onion were unavailable for comment.  Visitors to Anderson's two sites have noted his increasing obsession with the online version of The Onion (www.theonion.com).  College-friend Joseph Collins, 24, remarked that "at first it was kinda funny.  Mike would bring up The Onion every once in a while and we'd all have a good laugh - it was like that weird Clinton-thing he had going.  But he's gone completely over the edge now.  I mean, JFC, he relates  everything  to The Onion these days."  Eric Lee, 22, another regular visitor to Anderson's sites, thinks the problem might be rooted in the poor economy of the U.S. at the moment.  "I was talking to Mike on the phone a few months back and we were bitching about jobs and how we couldn't find any.  Then he jokingly said something about how 'maybe I can write for The Onion' and we both had a good laugh," Lee reported.  "Next thing I know, he won't shut up about the damn thing.  It's always 'The Onion This' and 'The Onion That.'  God, I just want to smack him sometimes."  Lee did, however, allow for the fact that any sort of job was difficult to attain in the current economy so "it's not like (Mike's) being any less realistic than I am."  "At first I was worried about finding a job when I got back to the States," Anderson said, "but then I realized that I'd found my calling while posting on my blogs."  Anderson's blog initially chronicled his observations about the French and their way of life, but gradually gave way to more and more pop-culture references.  "I really saw the light," said Anderson, describing his decision to alter the blog-theme.  "It was like in 'The Blues Brothers' when that shaft of sunlight comes through the church window and lights up John Belushi.  I just knew I had to do it."  Several friends indicated that Anderson's decision to begin a "Point/Counterpoint" blog marked the juncture at which his Onion obsession took full swing.  Colin Girgenti, 22, a recent graduate of Villanova University, feels that a certain mishap regarding kittens featured prominently in the decision.  "Yeah, Mike and the guys were picking on me about something my friend Annie had written.  They were, like, 'Colin loves kittens...if properly prepared' and 'man, Colin sure loves his kitten shakes.'  I kinda overreacted a little and there were some misunderstandings on both ends, and next thing I know, Mike's posting a debate about kitten-blending."  Soon after, Anderson started his point/counterpoint blog.  "Yeah, that was awesome," Anderson said.  "After the kitten debate, I just knew I had the right touch for that kind of thing.  I think most of them are at least as good as the ones on The Onion."  Friends remain dubious.  "He's deluding himself," Collins stated.  "Some of them are good, but most of them are just pop-culture re-hashes."  Lee agreed, remarking that "he can't even post one debate a month anymore.  How the heck is he going to be able to write for The Onion?"     Above: An enraged Mikael Anderson refuses to admit that The Onion might not want to hire him.   These opinions, however, appear to have had no effect on Anderson.  "It's so obvious that the guys at The Onion are already visiting my site," said Anderson.  "I mean, they're even using some of my material!  That stuff I wrote about evil twins made it into one of their horoscopes.  And remember that rant about the Dixie Chicks posing nude in protest?  Well, one of my friends left a comment that 'we really need to speak out against Shania Twain,' and next thing you know they've printed almost exactly that on The Onion!"  Anderson concluded by saying, "if they're already using stuff I've written, I honestly can't fathom what's holding up the hiring process."

      i hate how every time i'm at home i remember a particular topic i want to blog about, but once i get  here  i have no idea what it was.  well, at least i remember the second post for later this evening.  oh yeah, and someone in the department mistakenly called me "isabelle" yesterday.  it was rather disconcerting - i was sitting there on my own in the computer room and someone walked in saying "isabelle."  i thought he was concluding a conversation with someone else, so i didn't turn around.  when he tried "isabelle" again, it occurred to me that - since there was no one else in the room - he must be talking to  me .  turning around elicited a rather stunned look and a wealth of apologies.  i feel like dave at the halloween party on "newsradio": "how do you think  i  feel, to find out at age 32 that i'm much better-looking as a woman..."

      apparently you can get a "customer service representative" on the line if you start cursing at the automated response system.  basically, after trying every possible phone tree option, i went back to the recorded voice told me that "I can help you!  But  first  I'll have to ask you a few questions.  If you've already talked to me and want to answer before I finish asking the question, go ahead!  I won't mind." in the hopes that maybe i'd abandoned that option too soon and that there was a "if you do press any buttons, please hold for the next available customer service representative" message hidden at the end.  but noooooo.  rather, the automated recording blithely continued on in that indescribably aggravating "let's pretend i'm actually self-cognizant and  not  really a computer program!" way, asking for my flight number.  at this point, all semblance of barriers broke down and i started to let loose with an array choice words.  "what the f*ck?!?  you goddamn piece of sh-" "please hold for our next customer service representative!"  me: (stunned silence) me one moment later: "yes!" inner me: whoo hoo!  and just so y'all know, i'll be returning to the states on September 30th.  included in the travel itinerary is a 3 hour afternoon layover in chicago (so if you're still in the city, eric...).  and yes, i'm somewhat irked by american airlines' decision to eliminate the "Charles de Gaulle ---> JFK ---> Bradley" option.  however, given the choice between switching planes in chicago or doing such in miami, i picked chicago, thinking that adding  four  hours to my flight time was quite enough, thankyouverymuch.

      so i've started eating meat again - not that i ever deliberately stopped, but i looked back over the past couple months and realized "huh.  i haven't eaten any meat in a really long time.  that's weird."  then again, it's NOT that weird given my prior habit of forgetting anything not derived from grain (yeah, pasta!), dairy (mmmmmm....cheese), or legumes (the last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers).  so anyway, i've taken to eating turkey sandwiches.  i've also decided to eat more fruits, so i've upped my apple and orange intake and reduced my peanut butter consumption.  i figure i've been inexplicably not blimp-sized for the past 3-4 years, so why push my luck now?  on the other hand,  something's  evidently been right with my diet, so i probably shouldn't shake things up.  i've got quite the little conundrum on my hands, don't i?  ah well, i gotta go attempt to get in touch with the elusive American Airlines right now so that i can change my departure date.  i was highly unsuccessful in this bid last night, so we'll see if i have any more luck this time around.  back later for the second post - fear not, loyal fanbase.

      based on numbers 100-81 and espn page2's examples, i feel fairly safe in asserting that vh1's "Top 100 Songs of the Past 25 Years" is going to fill me with uncontrollable blinding rage.  "Say My Name" by Destiny's Child at 79? Eminem's "Lose Yourself" at freakin' number 4??? or how about the incredibly-overplayed (and boring) "Don't Know Why" featuring Norah Jones gracing the chart in the 99th slot?  and although i admit that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is worthy of selection, putting it at number 1 seems patently ridiculous.  the whole "let's elevate 'smells like teen spirit' to legendary status" movement has been one of the most infuriating trends of the last five years.  i mean, for crying out loud, i remember it showing up as the "number one music video of all time" on mtv, in spite of the fact that the video isn't even very good.  i'm so pissed off and they haven't even released the complete list yet.

      i shouldn't poke fun at minor issues in otherwise well-written articles, or else people  urlLink more accomplished than i am  might link over to my blog and be offended.  apologies to Mike Bayham.  here's his  urlLink most-recent article , in which he manages to ply the new york times for a job while simultaneously chastising them for their decision to hire Jayson Blair (of "i make up my own stories" fame).  given the leftist tendencies of the Times, he's likely not serious in his desire to write for them, but - who knows - he may be trying to give the paper a little more balance.  anyhoo, i'll be more careful about writing nonsense about other writers in the future, especially given what a wealth of material i provide daily in this blog which could oh-so-easily be turned against me.  (want an example?  how about the "other writers" thing i just wrote?  yeah, i'm a "writer" all right!)

      ooh - and in a second dose of "mike's making the world better", wouldn't society be so much better off if everyone had a visible "respect-o-meter"?  (those of you who read "Who Cares" in the UR comics know what i'm talking about)  think of the possibilities!  you wouldn't have to put out any more effort "masking contempt" (as joe put it recently) because it would be a fruitless endeavour.  bosses would know exactly which policies made employees want to stab people, as they could implement a new idea and then watch the meter.  perhaps most importantly, girls would  know  that the asshole guy has no respect for them.  heck, guys (for that matter) would have real-time updates as to how well they're doing with a particular girl (or guy if that's what floats your boat).  so much potential for good...probably for evil too, but mostly good!

      it's kinda sad when managing not to finish an entire tube of pringles in a day is a source of pride.  are there support groups for this type of problem?  can we get some kind of legislation going through to order pringles to make their product less stackable?  that kind of temptation can't be legal.  who  can  resist the deliciously insidious desire to munch on stacks of 2, 3, 4 at a time...or more!  along these lines, i'm also calling for new laws requiring Bugles to contain no more than the amount of fat you  expect  them to contain.  they LOOK like a low-fat snack.  they taste like a low-fat snack.  so it must be a low-fat snack, right?  wrong!  they've got  more  fat than potato chips.  at least here in france...  i feel very strongly about this.

      in regards to the post below, i have decided that i am the gaming world's equivalent of the utility infielder.  soooooo, that means i'm handing out positions/roles for the regulars.   Colin:  Pinch Runner - based primarily on recent blog-pattern.  bursts of speed at infrequent intervals.   Ben:   Enforcer - largely on account of his harrowing "disc of death."  the guy that's willing to plunk any and all opposing players for even a perceived slight.   Joe:   Long Relief - woulda been a starter, or a crafty veteran member of the rotation, but he ditched his blog and thereby got moved to long relief.   Evil Twin Matt:   Defensive Specialist - disappears from time to time and then suddenly returns for some very-snappy commenting.  quick reactions and solid keyboard-work.   Eric:   Youppi!  (haha)   Samay:   Optioned to the minors.   Yann:   "Baseball?  What's that?"   So he gets to be a batboy.  to be fair, i should make eric a top-end of the rotation starter but youppi/olympic stadium is kind of a running joke.   furthermore, samay would be the "quirky reliever", but it's always fun to snub samay.

      i recently realized that my video-game playing (mainly in RPG's or in games with RPG-like qualities) eerily reflects my real life.  i mean, i was thinking about how i set up my characters when i noticed that i never specialize in any particular abilities - instead, i try to build up every possible talent equally.  a couple examples: in jedi-knight, you choose which force powers to which you assign stars earned by finding secret locations.  was i willing to accept a lesser-ability in force sight in return for a higher level in force speed?  no!  no, indeed, i forced myself to track down  every damn secret  so i could spread the wealth as evenly as possible.  or how about the special abilities in diablo II?  i never reached the really cool stuff at the end of the building tree because i insisted on trying to develop every possible skill.  then i look at my real life...  first there's my 2 majors and a minor because i didn't want to close out any options.  or how about the times it's seemed like two or three women were interested in me simultaneously and i ended up with... none  of them?  maybe if i was the type of gamer to go all-out for the kickass talent at the end of the skill-tree, i'd also be the type of person who'd pursue one of the women even though it meant passing up on the other two.  it makes me worry about the fact that my starcraft strategy is entirely too defense-oriented and how i'm unwilling to expand to another base unless i have overwhelming force.  it also makes me wonder what it says about me that i always pick female RPG characters...

      from my friend kelly in regards to the "F�te de la Musique" on June 21st:  "Yeah, la fete de musique....tons of drunk young kids clinging from  statues, dropping one by one on the heads of the people below them listening to french people sing english lyrics they don't quite understand.  Been there.  Rennes Summer 2001.  Had some big fat guy fall off a statue on my head and spent the night holding the ice that we begged for at a bar to it."  and to totally switch topics, discounting the drummer who left the band, wouldn't you agree that George Harrison got the worst deal out of any of the Beatles?   Paul McCartney - tragic loss of his wife after many years of marriage...but fell in love again and got remarried.  has a bazillion dollars.  was "the cute beatle."    John Lennon - shot in the head...but revered by countless fans worldwide who still hold vigils for him.  fell deeply in love with someone who loved him back seemingly just as much.  considered the antoine walker to paul mccartney's paul pierce of the beatles.  Ringo Starr - well....he's ringo, the butt of many jokes...however, he's got the "always good for a joke or two reputation."  best roles in the beatles movies.  no really significant personal tragedies.  and then there's George Harrison...the forgotten Beatle.  the guy who always seemed pretty lonely.  the guy who got stabbed in the chest by a stalker approximately 50 times...and survived (no vigil for  him ).  and as if that wasn't enough, he beat cancer once...only to die from a second round of it a few years later.  total shaft.

      it looks like the older era artists have had more success when it comes to going solo than most recent efforts.  every single one of the artists on the first list have had solo success though less so for stephen stills, and perhaps tom petty's solo releases should be considered "Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers Minus Stan Lynch" ("Stingers S-T" comes to mind...).  then add in artists such as paul simon, john lennon, ted nugent, pete townshend (not quite as successful, of course), lou reed, neil young, jeff beck, and the illustrious OZZY.  extend into the mid-80's and you can include michael jackson, peter gabriel, phil collins, george michael, sting, don henley - hell, even belinda carlisle made it.  contrast that with more recent attempts to go solo - geri halliwell and melanie c(hisholm) of spice girls fame, chris cornell's disastrous solo outing, dave navarro's hideous offerings, scott weiland, the list goes on and on.  and let's not forget ones who split, had one of two albums of success and then disappeared into oblivion - artists such as wyclef and lauryn hill (though, to be fair, lauryn hill has enough talent to come back and buck the trend).  it's like every single one of the newer artists took a look at david caruso leaving nypd blue and thought "man, that's a  great  idea!"  and it's not like the problem is reserved for the younger generation of musicians, it seems to be a timing thing...note mick jagger's "electrifying" single 'god gave me everything i want' released just last year.  let's just ignore that anyway because the stones are running on the fumes of their fumes, and expecting jagger to release anything worthwhile is somewhat far-fetched.  to be honest, i've probably neglected several solo artists from the 90's and beyond who left popular bands for individual success - maybe i just don't want to accidentally disprove my conjecture.  and perhaps the most persuasive argument against my theory - two words: art garfunkel.

       The Big Music Post   i was looking through some Stevie Winwood releases when i noticed that he didn't go solo straight from the Spencer Davis Group.  instead, he moved on to Traffic before he went off on his own.  this got me thinking, why is it that there are so many artists from the 60's and 70's that hit it big with two or more bands whereas nowadays it's virtually impossible to "make it" with more than one group?  let's ignore people leaving bands to go solo for the moment.  furthermore, something like Melissa auf du Mar switching from Hole to Smashing Pumpkins doesn't count.  it's just not the same level.  Tom Petty - Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Traveling Wilburys (yeah, that's stretching it a little, but you gotta love petty.  if you count the wilburys then i need to put in...) George Harrison - Beatles, Traveling Wilburys Stevie Winwood - Spencer Davis Group, Traffic Joe Walsh - The James Gang, Eagles Paul McCartney - Beatles, Wings Eric Clapton - Cream, The Yardbirds Jimmy Page - Led Zep, The Yardbirds David Crosby - The Byrds, Crosby Stills and Nash (and Young) Stephen Stills - Buffalo Springfield, Crosby Stills and Nash (and Young) ...to name a few.  on the other hand, what do you have recently?  Dave Grohl, of Nirvana and Foo Fighters fame.  Temple of the Dog doesn't count because it was a one-and-done tribute album to the lead singer of Mother Love Bone who had died of a drug overdose.  Pearl Jam members don't count either, because Mother Love Bone simply wasn't around long enough.  besides, it's virtually the same band with a new lead singer - would you count the two different incarnations of AC/DC?  or the many eras of Van Halen?  Audioslave runs up against the same problem in that it's basically Rage Against the Machine with a new lead singer.  Perhaps Chris Cornell should count, but the rest of the members get no consideration.  And  Cornell  only counts if Audioslave hangs around long enough.  Same with Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins, Zwan).  Check back in a few years and we'll see what they're up to.  Damon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz), Chris Frantz (Talking Heads, Gorillaz) and Tina Weymouth (Talking Heads, Gorillaz)  get the same treatment until another Gorillaz album or two comes out.  However, here are some stunning failures of the recent past:  Joe Perry - Aerosmith, The Joe Perry Project Slash - Guns 'n' Roses, Slash's Snake Pit Scott Weiland - Stone Temple Pilots, Some GNR spinoff band  i can't even be bothered trying to find more, though i know there are many out there.  is there any explanation for this?  could it be marketing, perhaps?  fan backlash when a band breaks up or a member leaves?  or maybe i'm completely off the mark.  going solo seems to hold the same pattern, if you extend the 60's and 70's into the mid-80's or so.  i think perhaps i'll treat this in tomorrow's blog.

      joe's already gotten this in an email, but...  i found an article  urlLink here  on imdb where Dole wanted to do a debate with Clinton (teehee) beginning with "Mr. President, tonight I'd like to talk about the danger of unemployment . . . for me and you!"  my first reaction is that had bob dole shown the same sense of humor  during  the 1996 election as he has afterwards, clinton (teehee) woulda had a lot tougher time getting re-elected.  then, however, joe informed me about several columnists who had made the same conjecture i did about clinton (teehee) wanting to run for president again if they repeal the 22nd amendment.  here's  urlLink some dude's  take on the matter.  (okay, so 'some dude' is mike bayham and he writes for gopusa.com).  i really only include this article because of the part where he writes: "Bill Clinton (teehee), in the eyes of more than a few Republicans, is perceived to be an indestructible juggernaut that cannot be defeated, a fear that has been taken to an almost superstitious level. The very mention of a potential Clinton (teehee) candidacy could have the same effect on GOP leaders that the uttering of Richard the Lionheart's name had on insolent Muslim children."  ("teehee"s added by me, of course, because the name makes me laugh)   ignoring all the "avatar of vishnu" stuff, here's the dictionary.com definition:  juggernaut   n 1: a massive inexorable force that seems to crush everything in its way  sooooo....an "indestructible juggernaut that cannot be defeated" is  how  many times redundant...?

      i miss futurama.  is she still-she still jenny from the block?  i don't have to pay any income tax in france!  and i'm so goddamn pissed off that i wasted almost 1/2 hour of my time at the internet caf� working on thehartford.com's resume builder, only to have it inform me when i went to save that my session had expired and that i should've better spent the time with my thumb up my ass.  i wanna strangle someone right now...it's not looking good for the guy at the computer next to me.

      It's Joe again.  Here's everybody's dose of humor for the day...  "In an  urlLink unprecedented move , pop diva Jennifer Lopez today retracted sixteen key words from her hit song �Jenny From the Block,� in effect conceding that she is no longer the down-to-earth neighborhood girl depicted in the platinum-selling single."  In other news,  urlLink RIP Futurama .

      i sent 600 euros home and inexplicably only ended up with 602 dollars.  i'm so pissed.  the first time i sent 600 euros home, the exchange rate was 1.035 dollars per euro, and i ended up with about 620 bucks.   this  time, the exchange rate was 1.1311 dollars per euro, and i somehow ended up with 18 bucks less?  makes no sense.  there's gonna be a whuppin' handed out.

      stupid internet cafes...  once again, keepin' it brief (and real.  keepin' it very real.)  i have to move out of my apartment on the 26th of september, even though i have to pay for it until the 30th.  why?  because they can't do the �tat de lieu thing on the 28th (it's a sunday), and they don't do them on saturdays either.  in addition to that, i have to hand over my keys immediately upon completion of the inspection.  can't wait to crash at a friend's place for a few days.  "yay"  also, someone in this internet cafe really smells.  damnit.

      heya - me again.  at an internet cafe, so i don't have time for anything lengthy.  just got back from paris and compiegne.  good times.  seeing kelly was really cool, as was staying with ben at his place in the ritzy 16th "district" of paris.  oh yeah, some guy at the train station came up to me and we had the following exchange (in french) while i was putting my change away:  him - are you from paris? me - no. him - do you speak french? me - yes. him - finish what you're doing then come see me.  i have a little present for you. me - (with no intention of doing any such thing) okay.  yeah, so i left Mister Little Present wherever the heck he went and got on the subway like i initially intended.  outta time.

      Hey, it's Joe.  Kael hinted that I could write something, so here it is.  I'd like to bring your attention to HillZoo's Hill Staffer of the Week,  urlLink Hewitt Strange .  Most of the staffers of the week are airheaded bimbos (Best advice: "Never give your number to a guy born north of the Mason-Dixon line."  Screw you, biatch!), or pathetic geeks who are under the impression that they're cool.  Mr. Strange lives under so such pretense.  He knows he's a chunky, goofy-looking guy, and he's willing to have fun with it.    Some highlights from the profile: Q: What is the first thing you'd do as a Member of Congress? A: What can you do as a freshman? I reckon sit there and look pretty, which I admit I have a natural talent for. In the meantime, I would hire Snoop Dogg to be my intern coordinator.  Q: Behind my back, people say ... A:  ... "Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life"  -"...he plays football much like I did: just fall on top of the skinny kids and don't let them up."  -"Like Uncle Earl said, I want to be buried in Louisiana so I can stay active in politics."

      right, so i'm in paris at the moment, and there are approximately two french people in the city.  it's at least 90% anglophone tourists.  anyway, ben has a qwerty keyboard and i suck at it (though it's coming back fairly quickly).  this is also costing him money, so i'm going to sign off.

      the university is closing so my blog will be going on hiatus for the next couple months.  i won't be writing anything unless i scrounge up the cash to go use an internet cafe.  maybe joe will write or something, but eric and colin are too busy and i won't be online, so don't expect too much.  also, even though my hair is falling out at an astonishing rate, at least i've managed to go from a major-league fatass to only a minor-league one in the past month.

      the first compelling argument i've heard for me to have children:  "for some reason, i picture mike having a child being something along the lines of when bill mcneill was going to adopt a kid. like when he's walking around with a sandwich in the baby carrier. except mike would just have a mello yello and a pack of club crackers in there."  ~Eric Lee in a comment on Samay's blog.  i mean...i almost want one of the little bastards now.

      on sunday, i was looking through the TeleGuide to see what was on after Third Watch when i came across " Some Title I Can't Remember : film erotique italien."  at first i thought i was looking at the wrong teleguide, since that's what had been on after third watch in the previous week.  but then i found the old teleguide, and - sure enough - there had been another erotic italian film the week before.  tracking down the teleguide from two weeks ago uncovered the same thing.  so apparently, sunday night is "Erotic Italian Film Night".  (and never erotic french, or erotic german, or whatever.  just italian.)  extremely explicit too - the people at Cinemax would be shaking their heads, saying "well now that's just going too far."  the french also have a bizarre predilection for drinks that are half fruit juice and half milk.  i tried one once and it was absolutely vile.  vaccuum cleaners are best employed for sucking up spiders - cleaning rugs?  screw that!

      Bastille Day was yesterday here in France, which meant yet another week in which  everything  was closed for 2 out of the 7 days.  they even had the fireworks display on the 13th, and i'm guessing that was so no one would have to work on the 14th.  Cherie FM - the "love songs" station - often plays Dido's "Hunter."  the irony being that it's such a blatant breakup song.  and once again, i garnered more than one top in my box of "Pops".  this time i netted only two, but still...  add that to the 5 slices of turkey i got in a 4-slice pack, the 7 slices of cheese i got in a 6-slice package, and the 5 tops i got out of the  last  box of cereal, and i'm thinking it's time for me to buy a lotto ticket or three.

      on the plus side, rickey henderson is back in the big leagues!  however, in an utter travesty, roger clemens is on the all-star roster.  just two days ago i was feeling like the new system actually works and that i couldn't thank the Powers That Be enough that roger clemens had been left off the roster, thereby avoiding yet another year of Cal Ripken Syndrome.  then some idiot goes and decides he should replace barry zito  who isn't even injured .  check out the infuriating story  urlLink here  on sportingnews.com.

      i was watching M*A*S*H last week on TF5 (Arte), when it occurred to me that M*A*S*H is very similar to Monty Python's "Holy Grail" in that both are more a collection of sketches than they are typical movies.  i picked up a pair of socks today to get dressed and put them on my bed.  i reached down for the second sock and noticed that there was a big honkin' spider on it, which promptly declined to be squished (i slammed a kleenex box on it, and it said "thank for the massage, but i don't need another one"), and scuttled away into my futon somewhere.  i managed to find it and tried to vacuum it up, but the loose fabric kept trapping the vacuum hose, and the damn thing got away.  so now i have a large spider hiding somewhere in my bed.  given my already-disturbed sleeping habits, i'm sure i'll sleep  great  tonight.  i keep waffling on my decision to purchase "Frampton Comes Alive" for 2 euros on CD.  monday is Bastille Day (and ben's birthday), so i will be unable to come in.  see y'all on tuesday.

      i watched Shanghai kuh-niggits last night in an attempt to wipe out the memory of "equilibrium."  too bad that movie sucked too.  Lord Rathbone was a great nemesis, but the movie was just way too gimmicky.  too much effort to be "clever" about historical allusions.  and on top of that, the music wasn't nearly as good as it was in  the first film.  let's take two "escape scenes"  shanghai noon: "back in the saddle" escaping the gallows. shanghai knights: "magic bus" escaping the burning barn.  now, magic bus is a pretty decent song, but it didn't even come close to fitting into the movie as well as back in the saddle did.  argh, i'm irritated.  it's really going to suck when i end up seeing "van wilder" in a desperate effort to watch something that lives up to my expectations.  after all, it's much easier when your expectations are exceedingly low.

      let's all take a moment to thank CCF (my bank) for screwing up my trip to dublin!  (pausing to thank CCF)  basically, i ordered - and paid for - an international ATM card when i opened my account in november.  when my card arrived, the person behind the counter took a look and said "whoops - there's been a mistake.  we'll send you another card, which should arrive in about a week."  a week later, the replacement card arrives.  all is sunny.  flash forward to yesterday - the first time i attempt to  use  my card in a situation where i'd need international capabilities, it let's me down.  i confirm from the signup papers that i do, indeed, have a international/visa card and proceed to try again - failure!  so today i trucked on over to CCF and asked them to look at my card and tell me if it's a visa.  the answer, of course, is a big fat "no", at which point i hand them the papers from when i created the account and show them that the box for "visa bleue" is clearly checked-off.  "oh okay, we can take care of that.  oh look at this!  you  had  an international card, but then it got cancelled."  which means that i was given the right card at the beginning, only to have it taken away and replaced.  i'm definitely going to get in touch with someone at CCF about this, seeing how they screwed me out of my trip to dublin - especially given that i PAID to have the international/visa option and they apparently just took my money and didn't do jack.

      here's ryanair.com's response to my attempt to books a flight:  " SORRY  Regrettably, your card has been declined. Please go back to the previous page and ensure that the information you entered was correct. Otherwise, please try another card or call our reservation center."  three confirmations of information and subsequent attempts to book the flight resulted in the same message.  now, since i dug out my initial bank account setup, i am positive that i have a Carte Bleue Visa Debit Card (TM) - even so, i tried clicking on "Visa" instead of "Visa Debit/Electron", to no avail.  which seems to indicate that in an extremely irksome turn of events, dublin is now unavailable.  and don't get me started about the exorbitant "reservation center" phone charges.  hasn't europe heard of the toll-free customer service number?  1.35 connection fee plus .34 a minute for the internet helpdesk?  unheard of!  33 cents a minute for plain old reservations?  absurd!  i will nevertheless suck up the 33 cents a minute in one final effort to make these arrangements.  however, it does not bode well.

      in a completely unexpected turn of events, "Equilibrium" ended up being a really bad movie.  maybe it would be better in english...  then again, that wouldn't do anything about the fact that it was entirely predictable.  also, the trip to dublin has hit a bit of a snafu on the payment end - namely, that ryanair.com doesn't appear to accept Carte Bleu.  i have approximately 4 hours to figure something out or the trip's off.  i was starting to get annoyed that my box of "Honey Pops" didn't include the advertised "spinning attack top", but then i looked at the bottom and saw it.  then something else...  then another something else...  and eventually i pulled out  five  tops.  party time(?).  why can no one spell "definitely" ?  it's way too hot here.

      trying to swing a "2 days in paris then 4 days in dublin" trip starting a couple weeks from now, but it all depends on when i get responses from people involved.  also trying to swing a trip to poland in september, but  that  one depends on my ability to find a flight for under 490 dollars.  plus, my left shoulder just looks really strange.  always has.  it's just way knobbier than it should be.  more "Top 100 Songs of the Past 25 Years" issues: (no repetition of prior ranting)  "don't speak" at number 16 waaaay too high. "i will always love you" performed by whitney houston (but WRITTEN by dolly parton) unfortunately belongs (given how many times it was played), but still makes me want to hurt people. "waterfalls" by tlc?  puh-leeze. oh god, no!  it's "when doves cry"!  why?  WHY???  jesus, that was the Top 20 alone.  moving on to the other brackets... (80-61) what the hell?  "work it" by missy elliot? mary j blige's "real love"...  riiiiiight. has anyone ever heard of "good times" by chic? i can't believe i just saw nelly's name on the list.  and for "hot in herre" (no, that's not a misspelling by me, i copied directly from the vh1 site) same issues with backstreet boys "i want it that way" as with "i will always love you"  whoa christ - "i don't want to miss a thing", one of the worst aerosmith ballads.  it wasn't even one of the alicia silverstone trilogy.  all told, 60-41 has the least issues thus far.  40-21's contribution to the "oh hell no" list?  "baby one more time" by britney spears.  with a spot left open for "my heart will go on (theme from titanic)"  100-81 was already ranted about, in addition to misc. items revealed on Page2's daily quickie.  vh1 sure put a lot of dreck on that list.  yeesh.

      i'd like to introduce legislation that makes it legally within my rights to shoot people who don't dispose of their gum properly.  My voicemail message: "i'm running now - stop laughing! - after which i shall be showering and then checking on jennifer's apartment.  since she has a TV, i will probably also plunk down in front of it for a couple hours." My dad's message:  "sounds like you have a fun night ahead of you!" the worst part is that he was dead serious.  in a huge change from a couple weeks ago, two girls deliberately smiled at me and said "bonsoir" instead of crossing the street to get away from me.  of course, they'd just been verbally accosted by two drunken amateur homeless people (they're not  really  homeless, they just like to pretend) from the other side of the street, so i was the lesser of two evils, i guess.  pants: 44 is too big, 42 is too small, and 43 doesn't exist.  (not inches)  it's the same damn problem i have with shoes - 14 is too big, 13 is too small, and 13.5 doesn't exist.  i think Roger Daltrey would make a great Dr Who, and not just because of the band connections.  i mean, he  looks  like a Dr Who!  plus, he's acted before in a bunch of stuff - he was great as Fitzcairn (spelling?) on Highlander: The Series.  and as i've said before, i hate french radio.

      so i've been running a bunch lately, but it's pretty sad.  personally, i think that what's most likely to make me stop running isn't so much that it sucks, but that i'm really pathetic at it...  i'm also still infuriated that i left Ferris Bueller off my re-list.  dreamcast looks less and less likely to happen, given the unexpected scarcity of games (and the inherent higher prices).  unfortunately, i was getting more and more enamoured with the idea - but then again, why get a dreamcast if you can't find any decent games for it?  and  especially  if you can't get Soul Caliber?  i think kevin spacey gave my all-time favorite exercise goal in American Beauty: (paraphrasing on this part) "so, do you want to work on muscle endurance, on cardiovascular fitness, or what?" "i wanna look good naked." cracks me up every time.

      and are owen wilson and ben stiller trying to knock john cusack and jeremy piven off the top of the "movie buddies" list?  OW and BS: Starsky and Hutch The Royal Tenebaums Zoolander Meet the Parents Heat Vision and Jack (TV) Permanent Midnight The Cable Guy  JC and JP: Runaway Jury Serendipity Grosse Pointe Blank Floundering Bob Roberts The Player The Grifters Elvis Stories Say Anything One Crazy Summer  at first blush, it looks like JC and JP are the clearcut favorites...until you look at the release dates.  JC and JP's collaborations cover a period from 1987 to 2003 whereas with OW and BS, other than The Cable Guy, every movie was released 1998 or later - they've clearly got the momentum going for them.  in that same time period (1998 or later), JC and JP have done exactly *two* movies (Serendipity and Runaway Jury).  and yes, i deliberately excluded anything by Kevin Smith.  and no, matt damon and ben affleck haven't done enough together to enter consideration.  and yes, i realize that if directors were included, we'd be talking Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson versus Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.

      Okay, so  this  time, everything " connects " but you can't load any webpages for some new and altogether mysterious reason.  So once again, you're getting a " wastin' time until stuff works again " post.  Maybe i should write a short story or something.  Wait, the last time i wrote one of those was for Mrs Neighbours back in senior year of high school.  Holy crap did i hate that class.  Of course, it helped that she pretty much despised me as well.  I remember that we had to write a short story for her, and not only couldn't i care less, but i had a buttload of other work to do.  I ended up writing a " screw this "-paper in which i titled the thing " Frank " and then wrote about the birth and growing-up of " Frank " as if it were an animate entity. " Frank was conceived on such-and-such a day when Mrs Neighbours assigned� " " He was born on a crisp, cool evening a few days later� " " Frank wasn't sure what he wanted to be when he grew up� " " Then the Big Bad Physics test came and scared Frank so badly he ran and hid� "  etc etc i think i styled it like a children's book to emphasize how little respect i had for that awful waste of an hour of my life.  every freakin' day from 7 :48 - 8 :40 am, no less.  that woman seriously hated my guts - brutalized my papers, and tried to give me some flavor of C one quarter because " whoops, i forgot to record the re-grade on the paper i had everyone in the class rewrite. "  actually, i'm not altogether certain that it was a deliberate " i hate mike " situation (those of you who read " Zits " may recall the sequence in which the english teacher sits down and thinks " Jeremy Duncan, how i hate him. "), she may have genuinely decided that i was too dumb to be in the UConn Co-op english class.  I really wish i could've seen her face when she got a list of grades from the AP exam.  Or the SAT II Writing scores, for that matter.  two of the most satisfying " take  that  " moments in my life.  of course, i realize i'm virtually guaranteed to have her randomly come across my blog now.  oh well.  All right, let's try the internet again�  Right.  Big-time failure right there.  Shoot.  Not only did i not have enough time last night to finish all the crap i needed to do, but it looks like i won't be able to catch up today despite coming in way early.  Apparently, my " five-year reunion " is coming up in november.  Since i'll be living the high life�at my parents house�, i may end up at the high school that day.  I don't have any intentions of going to the  reunion , but i think it would be fun playing frisbee on the soccer fields while everyone else who shows up is doing something much lamer.  Maybe i should heckle as they pass by so they end up saying " screw this, i'm playing frisbee instead. "  or maybe i could take a poll as people enter to find out how many have moved back in with their parents (hey, at least i put it off a year and a half by staying in rochester for the summer and then high-tailing it to France for a year.)  There's a japanese version of Soul Caliber II for the 'cube at one of the stores here in Rennes.  Looks like a sweet game.  I'm still kinda weirded out by the inclusion of Link, but i guess they had to do something to appeal to the Nintendo crowd.  Also, i think i'm going to pick up some kind of used console for the summer.  Here are my options (only used games are under consideration):   Dreamcast - about 50 bucks.  Games - 9-15 bucks Pros - great RPG stuff.  Soul caliber.  Sweet graphics.  Good controller. Cons - 50 bucks used ?  it's freakin' 50 bucks  new  at home, and that includes games !  the game selection is somewhat limited.  Playstation - low price, 30 bucks.  Most prices, 35 or 39.  Games - 6-12 bucks Pros - fairly cheap.  Wide variety of games.  "castlevania: symphony of the night " Cons - i hate the controller with a passion.  N64 - low price, 25 bucks.  Most prices, 29 or 35.  Games - 8-20 bucks. Pros - great system.  Cheapest console.  Large selection of games. Cons - already own it at home.  Games a bit pricey.  Sega Genesis - price ?  Games - 1-5 bucks Pros - cheap-ass games.  Streets of Rage II, if i can find it. Cons - lame controller (press start to switch from punches to kicks in Street Fighter II ?  puh-leeze).  Not many games.  No price listed for the system.  Super Nintendo - think i saw it for 20 bucks.  Games -  2-9 bucks. Pros - like the controller.  Cheap system.  Cheap games.  Already found Street Fighter II. Cons - not much game choice.  Not certain if it would hook up to modern TV's.  system difficult to find, and disappears quickly.  I flat-out refuse to consider X-box, PS2, or the 'cube, because the used price is ludicrously high for both systems and games.  I only ever saw one old-school nintendo, and i doubt i could locate RBI Baseball, so i can't consider it.  So anyway, that's what i'm choosing from.  I had super nintendo on the brain for a while, but i haven't seen any in about 3 weeks, so that might not be an option.  Then i was leaning towards playstation because it was cheaper and had a wealth of games, but i'm liking the idea of a dreamcast more and more lately.  I just wish that the prices for Game Boy games weren't so ridiculous.  (35 bucks for Golden Sun  used  when it costs a lousy 15 bucks new in the states ?  screw that.)  Trying the 'net again�  Christ.  I hate this place.  I think i'll work on my resume for a bit and then post this once the computers start not-sucking again.

       urlLink Elodie  appears to have posted my picture on her website.  Unfortunately, i look rather�odd.  But at least i don't look enormously fat or anything - i just have a misshapen head.  Oh well.  On the other hand, i rock !  (according to the caption on the  urlLink photo page )     The world seems to be evenly divided between people who think i never curse and people who think i curse all the time.  A lightbulb blew in my apartment last night, but it seriously tried to take my apartment down with it.  Punk lightbulb�  went out with a huge bang and overloaded the main fuse, immediately putting me in the pitch black.  Luckily, i was near the door, which enabled me to get into the hall and turn on the light out there, giving me enough illumination to see inside the fuse box and reset things.  Homeless people appear to love my shirts.  the Captain America t-shirt and the bright tie-dyed one have elicited glowing praises from " the man on the street.

      so i'm pretty sure that i've mentioned the whole "movies mostly make crappy video games" thing before.  in fact, i've probably also brought up the "video games make crappy movies" deal as well.  however, that made me start wondering which video game made the  best  movie.  well, there's not a lot to choose frol.  you've got Tomb Raider, Super Mario Bros, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Final Fantasy, and Resident Evil.  maybe a couple more, but i can't think of any at the moment.  supposedly, they're intending on making a Diablo movie (which is why the new vin diesel movie was called "a man apart", as blizzard or someone owned the rights to that film name), but A: it hasn't been made anyway and probably never will be, and B: even if they  do  make it, it'll probably suck.  i've also heard tell of an "alone in the dark" movie, but that's just rumor, to the best of my knowledge.  personally, i think "thief" would make an awesome flick, but when has my opinion ever counted for anything in the movie biz?  i'm also somewhat surprised that "golden axe" was never made into a movie starring arnold schwarzenegger, though maybe we can just count the conan movies (and pretend that he wields an axe).  but anyhoo, i'm going to have to give my vote to Mortal Kombat.  it's just fun to watch, in spite of the enormous cheese-factor.  hell, probably  because  of its overwhelming cheesiness.  street fighter and mario brothers just plain sucked, tomb raider and final fantasy provided eye candy and little else, and resident evil was fair at best.  so in a war of attrition, Mortal Kombat comes out on top...most likely due to the preponderance of random cartwheels throughout the movie - it's like they all decided to try out for Gymkata a decade too late.

      It's now 6 :53 and i've been waiting for the computers to start not-sucking for approximately half an hour now.  Normally, i would've left by this point and returned tomorrow, but i've got some rather important emails to send so i'm wasting time typing in microsoft word in the hopes that the computers will magically fix themselves sometime in the next 30 minutes.  It ain't gonna happen, but we'll chalk it up to eternal optimism that i'm even making the attempt.  Who do you need to email, you ask ?  well, eric for one, because i just realized he moved today or yesterday and want to check in on how it went.  Yann, because i need to ask him a couple time-dependent questions.  My dad, because he sent me job info but mainly because he gets all weird when i don't respond (even if there's absolutely  no  reason to respond, if i don't do it i get frantic " hello, are you okay ? ?  did you get my email ? ? ? " messages).  my roommate pete, because i've been somewhat delinquent in responding to the email he sent me a couple days back.  Kelly, to see if she's still planning on visiting at the end of the month.  Among others.  Okay, now it's 7 :02 and i'm going to try again�  FAILURE (surprise, surprise)  Well  that  was a big 'fuck you'  from jesus (probably my favorite matt vitale expression). Actually, let's go through some of the UR people and list phrases i particularly liked from them. Matt : " that was a big 'fuck you' from jesus "  " hey look, i'm a 'fuck you'-powered rocket ship. " Joe : " dolp. "  " ruh roh, george. " Veej : " damnit, mike !  i can't lie when you're telling the truth ! "  " she's tall�like, taller than  me . " Samay :  " yeah..it was like - you know, i mean.  Right, so anyway�this one time - or was it�wait, no.  Awww crap. "  Wait !  7 :09, the computer next to me just booted up !  score !

      good times last night.  decent "americain steak hach� frites" followed by a bizarre animated movie called "les triplettes de belleville" - really cool, but very strange - then drinks and darts (and somehow i seem to have a knack for playing a game called "20", even though i got annihilated at "killer").  and on the way home (12:38 am) this cool green burning thingie streaked across the sky.  looked like a firework, but didn't explode, so it was probably a flare of some sort.  still cool though.

      and the random stuff -   i've been running more.  3 times in the last four days and i'm going to try to go again tonight depending on when i get back from the movie.  i tried to tell BVI that i was moving out and they informed me that i needed to send them a certified letter.  "but i'm right here.  i'm telling you i'm moving out.  can't you just write it down somewhere?"  "oh no, we can't do that.  you really have to send us a letter."  Fred and George are the only things J.K. Rowling has going for her right now.  the clearance rack simply doesn't exist in france.  as i was helping jennifer move, some dude stopped in front of us and started dancing while holding up a postcard for us to see.  i'm not even sure if he said anything, i think he just started dancing.  another dude asked me a question, so i stopped and put my hand in my left pocket since that's kind of the natural standing position for me.  of course, he immediately got all testy and asked me "why did you put your hand in your pocket!?"  after which he tried to get all buddy-buddy with me about my Captain America shirt.  "ohhh, you must be Irish, huh?"  "yup, you guessed it!"  and now i have to run, because i'm meeting my friend miriam at 7:30, but i have some errands to run first.

      another thing about "Nice People" - one girl had to take a phrase and set it to music (and perform it in front of the others later).  while she's practicing, the show runs a little caption that reads "Katrin has chosen to put the words to a Guns 'N' Roses tune."  which is all well and good, except that it was "knockin' on heaven's door" which clearly should have been credited to  Bob Dylan .  makes me so mad.  just because GNR covered it doesn't make it *their* song (just like "Live and Let Die")  i guess it's slightly better than the songs that rip off the main riffs from classic songs and pretend to be something "new" (like shaggy's "Angel", the new eminem song, virtually anything from puff daddy, that "i think i'm in love" song that samples "Jack and Diane", in addition to many others.  hell, i even heard one that i'm pretty sure copies "saving the day" off the ghostbusters album - the song at the end while they're driving to the building while huge crowds cheer them on...right before the earthquake nearly kills them.)

      i obviously don't get MTV here, but based on the pictures on Yahoo, britney and madonna had some serious French-style lip-locking going on...  yesterday had an overwhelmingly high proportion of jaw-droppingly attractive women swarming around rennes.  i'm surprised i didn't garner more dirty looks given that i went into sensory overload towards the end and could do little more than gape in absolute astonishment.  oh yeah, some idiot a couple days back decided to take a leak near the main intersection of the city...15 feet away from a mob of police officers who immediately started yelling at him.  ("yeah, yeah, i just can't hold it!")  in the re-read, i noticed that JK Rowling doesn't appear to be giving character descriptions anymore for the students.  i wonder if she's doing this to make casting easier for the movies still to come.  okay, i've got about five more points to make in the next blog, but not enough time to handle it now given the backlog of emails (in addition to the newly received ones).  and who knows when i'll finally get around to posting on Pathetic Steve (check  urlLink samay's  blog for the link).  outta here - thanks again to guest-posters.  keep your skills honed for the 10th-19th of september while i'm in poland, eh?

      i hate it when author's use excess exclamation points in their novels.  it really pisses me off.  i think my favorite seen in the Royal Tenenbaums is when Luke Wilson's character self-destructs on the tennis court.  you know the part where the announcers keep saying things like " what  is wrong with the Bomber?!?" while luke wilson waves ineffectually at the ball flying past him with only one shoe still on.  oh, and i booked my flight for poland.  nine days in krakow - should be damn cool.

      who's most likely to play the nutcase?  johnny depp, christopher walken, brad pitt, or steve buscemi?  i'm not sure steve buscemi should count, since he's always a sidekick-ish character whereas the others play larger roles.  oh yeah, and i think i coulda tackled a purse-snatcher...if i'd had any idea what was going on.  some old woman rounded the corner with the most inept run i'd ever seen (she was also pretty damn large), and yelled something incomprehensible, at which point the guy walking towards me turned around then took off running in the other direction.  by the time i saw the out-of-place purse-ish thing he was holding, he'd rounded the corner and was long gone.  so yeah, if i'd just understood that woman, i coulda been the "random passerby who foils a robbery."  drat.

      so there's this extraordinarily attractive girl who works at the post office.  unfortunately, she's also extraordinarily incompetent.  this leads me to a bit of a quandary every time i need to mail packages home - part of me thinks "oh sweet!  maybe i'll get Post Office Girl."  while another part of me simultaneously goes "oh crap, what if i get Post Office Girl?"  i'm thinking of maybe starting a website: "hiremike.com"  it would make the job search so much easier.  maybe a spinoff site "HireMikesFriends.com" would be in order as well.  k - boogie time.

      given my reputation for whining about the heat ("it's too hot.  wah!  wah!"), i thought it would be prudent to mention that it's the biggest heat wave france has ever experienced - news reports abound on the subject ("3000 dead in french heatwave", "180 parisians fall victim to heat", "bodies remain unburied in paris due to record temperatures", etc).  and on an unrelated note, i went running last night and had a guy shouting encouragement to me from his third story window.  "allez allez allez allez!  bon courage!"  oh yeah, and thanks to joe for updating when i can't get to the internet cafe.  i'm able to get out much more frequently than expected, but there are still some pretty big lapses from time to time.

      wolfenstein 3D on the GBA makes me realize just how much i like the mouse/keyboard combo.  and also what a gigantic nerd i am.  don't you love those moments when you say something along the lines of "yeah, my friend so-and-so - - - wait a minute.  no.  not my friend.  in fact, i hate this person."  eric's statement that any time you hear "not to be racist" you know you're about to hear something really funny seems to tie in closely with his earlier declaration that "any time i'm laughing uncontrollably, i realize in the back of my head that somewhere, someone's probably deeply offended."  i really really hate trying to buy tickets for movies with english titles here in france.  i can't win.  if i pronounce it like it should be, they give me crazy looks.  if i pronounce it "french", they give me crazy looks.  either way i'm screwed.

"when you walk away without talking to someone, that can be seen as racist!" (dude was some indeterminate minority).  got an electricity bill today...for -31.74 euros.  i like negative bills.  and lastly, now that kelly is gone, i am back to knowing zero people in rennes - but at least ben is still in paris and i should be off to poland in mid-september to see my friend angie.

      probably my last post until at least the 20th of september - though i may post on monday, and there's an off chance i'll hit up an internet cafe while in poland.  odds are low, however.  monday is the most likely, if at all.  here are my expectations for the next book in the series by the following three authors:   George R. R. Martin  - as i lie on my deathbed many decades from now, George R. R. Martin finally releases the fourth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series.  it kicks ass.   Robert Jordan  - sometime in early-2005, Jordan publishes the next book in the Wheel of Time series.  it's a whole lot of crap except the parts with Mat in it.   Terry Goodkind  - "richard is a rare person."  "who but richard would make friends with (insert person/thing/group here)."  kahlan does some stuff to prove she's not extraneous, likely military in origin.  zedd does cool stuff.   also, why is it that every time a female friend visits me, or i visit a female friend, the first question asked of me by people at home is some variation of "so, are you going to get laid?"  (though, to be fair, it would probably be a little less irritating if the answer wasn't consistently "no."  not that i'm dying to get laid or anything, i just like to shake things up.  don't want everyone at home thinking i'm a pathetic loser, you know.  don't wanna be a 'steve' - samay's version, not the donal logue movie-version.)

      right.  so my mom got a cell phone a while back but really doesn't know how to use it.  here's how bad it is:  she called up technical support and said "i need some help.  my phone is flashing and making noise and i can't figure out why or how to stop it.  do you know what's going on?"  i mean, can you imagine the guy at the other end of the line?  "ummm.  could it be...ringing?"  people who want jobs as computer programmers in france are required to take an english test before people will hire them.  i couldn't figure out why until the guy i was talking to told me that all the books are in english.  man, that must really suck for the french, huh?  can we make it illegal for girls under the age of 16 to have breasts?  thank you.  (it's either that or i have to start wearing my glasses again so that i can better judge age from a distance.)  and no, that doesn't mean i think it's okay to go after 16 year olds.  16 should be "look, but don't touch, and only look so long as you feel guilty about it afterwards."  17 could be "look, don't touch, and feel mildly skeevy."  and 18 and up could be "fair game, but only if you aren't too old, you dirty dirty bastard."

      tiger woods recently set the record for most consecutive cuts made.  good for him!  oh wait...i distinctly remember a tournament (the british open, i believe) in which the Powers That Be  restructured the cut  after tiger didn't make it, solely so he wouldn't be eliminated from competition.  man, you gotta love tv revenues.  or at least, somebody in charge appears to love them.  what a lame way to set the record.  way lamer than nykesha sales' layup that gave her the all-time scoring record for the UConn women's basketball team.

      i'm not certain why my posting frequency has declined so dramatically, but i think it might be related to my ability to once again sign on to instant messenger.  i've mentioned before how i noticed my posts had become similar to my IM away messages, so now that i'm able to actually create those away messages...  well, that could explain the dropoff.  anyway, i just got back from watching "Mystic River" and i'm really not sure what to think.  i  think  i liked it, but i'm not certain.  definitely a disturbing ending (which can be a good thing).  the disappearing/reappearing boston accent was slightly distracting, but i can't really hold that against the movie.  i'll have to ponder this for a bit.  whatever conclusion i draw won't change the fact that i'm glad i  saw  the film.  i'll try to get back into posting more frequently - on top of following up on a few more "pathetic steve" stories, and coming through with that online mag article for eric.

      haven't been really posting lately mainly because i wanted to avoid a giant soul-killing rant about the red sox (specifically, grady little).  things are going well here - my throws are still on the money, and i'm catching the frisbee much better than i was a week ago.  my mobility still needs a little work, but that's also improved already - just need to start reading the disc a bit better and i'm all set.  i also picked up TimeSplitters 2 on the gamecube.  damn good game.  damn good.  it's by the splinter-group that broke off from Rare when microsoft bought out the company, so the multiplayer is very Bond-like.  plus, it has a MapMaking feature, so i'm currently recreating Stack/pistols.  should be fun.  furthermore, i'm borrowing metroid prime from my friend burke - it's damn cool.  amazing graphics, great gameplay, and an incredibly good job of translating the 2-D game into 3D.  in fact, the transition is comparable to what nintendo managed with Mario.  and lastly, i got a haircut today.  took off about 7 inches worth of hair, and then shaved off the beard.  i now look approximately 16 years old and am fully expecting to be carded for R-rated movies.

      grady little is officially the Worst Manager of All Time.  the 8th inning just ended, and his asinine pitching decisions have allowed the yankees to tie the game.  i'm upset to the point of being speechless.

      just got back from Kill Bill.  man, that was...bloody.  also, the cute girl who'd been working the counter laughed at me as we were leaving because i went momentarily blind.  i stood up, my vision went black, i said "oh no - can't see...  can't see...", and the girl heard me and started chuckling.  not fair.  just not fair.

      score!  the red sox beat the yankees, and then family guy immediately came on the cartoon network - followed by futurama!  on top of that, i got my gamecube and n64 back after hiking up talcott mountain in the absolutely gorgeous autumn foliage.  translation: it's been a really good day.

      it's sickening how physically superior jessica simpson and nick lahey are.  i take solace in the fact that at least their not entirely genetically overwhelming - they just don't seem to have too much going on upstairs.  still, at least nick seems to be a pretty sincere guy who puts out effort and doesn't rely on personal assistants to follow him around picking up after him.  it's unbelievable just how spoiled jessica simpson is.  and the way she  whines  about her lot in life (usually regarding doing laundry, cooking, making things "look cute") irks me to no end.

      we all remember the movie "Predator" don't we?  well, apparently the voters do as well, since we could conceivably have three stars of the movie installed as governor simultaneously.  jesse ventura (MN) and arnold (CA) are already in, and  urlLink sonny landham  is running in KY.  with that in mind, why stop there?  don't we owe it to ourselves to further this great ambition?  carl weathers - what else are you doing right now?  and what about the rest of the predator gang?  unfortunately, Kevin Peter Hall - the man in the predator suit - cannot be considered as he died back in 1991.  david prowse wore a big suit for a few movies (the star wars trilogy, as vader), maybe we could substitute him...  there is serious potential here.

      i am absolutely infuriated by comcast's supposed "high speed internet" service.  to begin with, it frequently runs into significant wait times while attempting to load pages - it practically grinds to a halt on occasion.  secondly (and perhaps more importantly, in my opinion), it appears that comcast has made it such that you are unable to utilize any other search engine except their own.  you can load yahoo, but not search on it, and you can't even  load  google or altavista.  you get this bullshit error page that claims that there's no website configured at that address.  riiiiiiight - google and altavista don't exist at those sites.  i mean, what the fuck!?!?  in other news,  urlLink ben  has a blog.

      went to the City Steam Brewery in Hartford last night (it's right next to where that dude asked us for baby formula, samay).  cool place - kinda crummy band, but a cool place.  actually, i also had my first beer bong while there.  20 bucks for 3 liters of Naughty Nurse.  ooh!  and in related news, smoking has been banned in restaurants/pubs in CT (though i think bars are still legit).  personally, i couldn't be more thrilled.  and speaking of large quantities of alcohol - my friend alex apparently has a higher keg stand time than disc chug time.  which, from what i have heard, is an impressive feat.

      damnit - the bosox blew a lead in the ninth and then lost in 12 innings.  plus, i can't seem to catch a frisbee anymore.  on the plus side, i got to throw around, and i'm reacclimating to the keyboard fairly quickly.  oh yeah!  and the first day i was back, i managed to catch an episode of elimidate.  sweet!

      i gotta say, ABC used to be the Network I Couldn't Care Less About, but CBS is rapidly taking the place of honor in that race.  to be fair, it's not because CBS has gotten any worse.  rather, it's a function of just how cool Alias and The Practice are.  the weird thing is that Alias never really clicked with me until this year - - - maybe it was because it was one of the few decent shows they'd air over in France, which even gave me the opportunity to catch up on backlogged episodes (albeit in French).    furthermore, i really thought The Practice was going to suck after they eliminated half the cast.  that assessment couldn't have been further from the truth.  where prior seasons of The Practice had begun to get bogged down in dramatic overload, this year's addition of James Spader's character in particular has injected a pleasant dose of humor to the series.  nice going, ABC.

      wha?????  a cover of behind blue eyes...by LIMP BIZKIT?  that pretty much renders all the music sections of my brain incapable of thought.  well, maybe one thought... doesn't it look like The Darkness (brit heavy metal-type band)stole Peter Frampton's wardrobe?  also, given the sheer amount of dance floor grinding and bare flesh in the previews for "Honey" (jessica alba's new flick), it seems inexcusable that the movie has been rated only PG-13.  and i mean that in the Otto-goes-to-"Stoners-Pot-Paradise" kind of way.   blatant  false advertising.

      Joe here, guest blogging to warn everybody about a recent crime against humanity - Limp Bizkit's cover of "Behind Blue Eyes".  I was watching a little TV with my brother last night when an ad for the movie "Gothika" came on.  I was immediately captivated by a familiar tune, which I soon identified as somebody's rendition of "Behind Blue Eyes".  Noticing my interest, my brother explained to me that it was "a badass Fred Durst song", to which I replied that it was really a baddass Who song.  Obviously enthralled with the Durst version, I was unable to convice my brother of the badassness of The Who's original version.  So today I get online to investigate this a bit.  I'm not a knee-jerk Limp Bizkit hater (I think "Counterfeit" is a great track), so I was willing to give  this a shot.  I was initially irritated by what some apparently retarded chick wrote in her blog as the lyrics, including the phrase "but my dreams they aren't as empty as my  conscious  seems to be". [Emphasis mine].  So I think to myself, "ok, so I found a retarded Bizkit fan - no surprise here."  But oh no, it gets worse.  I decide to fire up KazaaLite and download the track in question.  It starts out as expected - Durst's sub-par voice was doing its best, which I found to be passable for the moment.  Not quite the "eye-socket raping" I was warned about by another internet site.  Then Durst gets to the line I mentioned earlier.  He does indeed say "conscious" rather than the original (and grammatically correct) "conscience".  I expect this kind of idiocy from Durst in his impromptu statements, but you'd think somebody at the record company would have noticed this and fixed it.  Then, as I'm anticipating the thunderous peak of the song, starting with "When my fist clenches crack it open...", I am met with some lame-ass speak-n-spell break strain, "discover l.i.m.p. say it" [4x].  The song never reaches the dynamic peak expected by fans of The Who, but rather, it just fades into a whimpering little pile of crap:   "no one knows what its like to be mistreated, to be defeated behind blue eyes no one knows how to say that they're sorry and don't worry"  Durst takes a few more lyrical liberties, but largely the song ends the way it's supposed to, with the startling omission of the cool part of the song.  How pathetic.

      Metroid Prime is an awesome game, but i think i'd like it even more if it didn't involve so much backtracking.  it doesn't have levels, as it were, but a giant world map where as you gain new abilities you can access new areas on the map.  however, it's not a linear progression, which - though it may be more realistic - becomes frustrating when you start wondering "is this the seven-hundred-fifty- first  time i've been through this room or the seven-hundred-fifty- second ?"  i think importing the warp feature from the zelda games would have provided a significant improvement.  in zelda, you have the same kind of expansive world map, but once the area you can access reaches a certain critical size, you start discovering warp zones placed at key locations.  now, they aren't exactly sprinkled about liberally (Ocarina of Time only had 4, to my recollection), but there are enough to cut down on the dead-time.  of course, i'm sure that purists would decry this addition to the Metroid Series, so it's never gonna happen...  ah well.

      i think what's holding me back from purchasing titles for the gamecube isn't so much the expense (it's really not all that bad, and you get a lot of playing time out of the games), but that it just wouldn't feel right playing so much when i don't have a job.  maybe when i start feeling a little more active about tracking some employment down i'll have a change of heart.  speaking of... - does anyone think that being a tae kwon do instructor is viable?

      espn2 appears to be suffering from programming difficulties.  perhaps they're simply running out of sports to show?  they've delved pretty deeply into pseudo-sports, of late.  as i type, they're showing chess - kasparov vs. x3d fritz.  the other day they showed the world scrabble championships.  a little before that, the world double-dutch jump rope championships.  i have no doubt that the world series of poker also made it onto the channel at some point in the past two weeks.  personally, i like watching the mini-golf tournaments, but at least there's some kind of sport-quality to them (and with double-dutch too, i guess).  however, even i can't think of how the programmers can show things like Magic: The Gathering tournaments on an espn network channel.

      well, this is fun.  in spite of cleaning out the gutters and proving i can get up for specific times in the morning, i've just been blamed for not being awake to help out "when it's needed."  soooo....those times that i wasn't awake to help?  you know, those times for which no one ever asked me to help?  those tasks that remain secret even now?  yeah, that was pretty inconsiderate of me.  by the way, what magical tasks are there that can only be accomplished before 11 in the morning?  and even if there are, it's obvious i can get up if someone tells me something like "hey - you need to be up at 6:30 tomorrow to help me do (insert whatever here)."

      hey - i'm back!  well, since the last time i blogged, i've been to a frisbee tournament, played another game, went to krispy kremes for the first time since i've been home, saw Alien in the theaters, and have been offered a job as a tae kwon do instructor at the place i've been going for the last 16 years.  eventful, eh?  i think other stuff happened too, but i can't seem to recall it at this juncture.  actually, alien was really cool - especially since i went with 4 people who had never seen it before.  on the other hand, the woman working the ticket counter was a total bitch.  i got to the line and she said (in a completely exasperated tone of voice): "lemme guess.  matrix, 9:45." and then immediately punched it in before i could even respond.  me: "actually, no.   alien , 9:30."  at this point, she got all huffy and pissed at ME.  why?  i don't know.  after all, she's the one who jumped the gun and punched in a ticket for the matrix without bothering to wait for me to tell her what movie i wanted.  i fail to see how i'm at fault here.

      hmmmm......sports news or geek news?  how about a little of both.  vin baker played two amazing games to start the season - looks like he's gunning for Comeback Player of the Year (not that the award actually exists anymore).  good to see that he's made some strides coming back from alcoholism.  the celts overall are playing better than i anticipated, and although i was appalled at the walker trade at first, it seems to be working out thus far.  i also refuse to discuss lebron james.  read about it yourself on any sports site, if you wish.  on the geekier side of life, TimeSplitters 2 on the gamecube is one heckuva game.  i admit it's a little annoying that the analog stick is too sensitive, but that seems to hold true for every game i've played on the system thus far.  it seems to be a controller "feature."  it's as though they engineered the stick to respond to the tiniest movements - not realizing that it makes it difficult to keep a steady aim on your target.  to be fair, it probably only requires a bit of time to adjust to it, but when you switch back and forth between the gamecube controller and the one for the N64 on a fairly regular basis, you don't get that opportunity.

      okay, we're going through yet another round of "Mike Disappoints His Mom."   whee!  yet again, my chosen job path evidently conflicts with what the maternal figure would prefer, thereby creating a good deal of tension.  actually, it's more of a "isolating herself in her room and not speaking to me even when she emerges" thing than outright tension, but let's not quibble.  in other news, i think i'm going to accept master yu's offer to become a Tae Kwon Do instructor at his school.  in addition to that, i shall be taking hapkido and judo lessons.  we'll see how this goes.

      i was going to blog about the List Of Things I Can't Do In The Eleven Minutes It Took Some Dude From Japan To Beat Super Mario 3, but i just discovered that my sparring gear is missing so i'm going to sit here and fume instead.  the tae kwon do pants that got thrown out?  cost me 60 bucks to buy a new uniform - 1.5 uniforms didn't do me any good since i still had to do a laundry every freakin' day.  now i have 2.5 and can alternate.  i also cannot locate over a dozen books that were on my bedside table before i left - that'll be another 80 bucks or so.  annnnnd, let's not forget the missing sparring gear - another 100 bucks there.  total cost of parents throwing stuff out without asking?  240 dollars and counting...  (though there's a chance that the books or sparring gear will resurface.  not that i'm holding my breath.)

      Joe here again, bringing everybody the latest from the "bad cover songs" front.  I've finally heard the Kid Rock "Feel Like Makin' Love" cover.  Eh.  I've head worse - specifically, Kelly Osborne's cover of the classic Black Sabbath song "Changes" from Black Sabbath Vol 4.  Of course, dear old dad lends a hand on young Kelly's slightly overproduced remake.  As much as the new "Changes" sucks, I can only hate it so much since Ozzy had a part in it.  Wait, no.  It still sucks.  Screw Ozzy.  I'm working on a theory of "the good cover'.  There are basically four types of covers:  The straight cover, the "modernized" cover, the "totally opposite style" cover, and (my fav), the "even more [blank] than the original" cover, where "blank" could be depressing, ass-kicking, or what-have-you.  "Makin' Love" and "Changes" are slight modernizations, but largely true to the originals.  A totally opposite cover would be Tori Amos's "Smells like Teen Spirit".  A "more [blank]" cover might be Radiohead's cover of "Wish you were here" by Pink Floyd.  Radiohead's version is even more depressing and sullen than the original, making it the perfect example of a good cover where substantial liberties have been taken with the music.  Kid Rock's "Makin' Love" fails to be substantially more ass-kicking than the original, and thus falls short of greatness.  Just don't get me started on Limp Bizkit again...

      watching KITH right now...  which of course means that i immediately saw a counter to my earlier proposition, in that bruce and mark were doing a sketch with dave.  then again, it lasted less than 30 seconds, during which time dave and bruce's roles consisted of slapping each other and looking like they hated each other.

      it's not much of a secret that the Kids In The Hall had a lot of divisive tensions going on in the group.  i think i recall reading that dave and bruce in particular disliked each other.  i guess it kinda makes sense, in a way.  after all, kevin and dave had some sort of connection already, as did bruce and mark.  the two tandems simply joined together, with scott coming seemingly out of nowhere.  that type of formation doesn't exactly lend itself well to group bonding or cohesiveness.  anyway, watch the show on comedy central and keep an eye out on the group dynamic.  you'll be amazed at how kevin and dave almost always partner up, and how mark and bruce do the exact same.  in fact, unless there's a scene with all five Kids, you'll rarely see either pair (or its components) work with the other.  if they require a third player, it's almost invariably scott.  if they need a fourth?  well, then it's time to bring in some random dude off the street.  here's a short list of some recurring roles (and yes, some of them aren't the  exact  same role, but bear enough similarities to be listed):  Dave/Kevin (and scott) Hookers Simon and Hecuba Lounge Performers Husband and dissatisfied wife  Bruce/Mark (and scott) Cops Sales Marketers  okay, i'm really drawing a blank here about bruce and mark.  i guess dave and kevin's stuff just stuck with me a little better.  either that or i'm trying to push mckinney out of my mind because i associate him with Chicken Lady.  well, that was just supposed to be recurring roles.  you'll find that the standalone sketches usually support the same viewpoint.  so check out the show and see what i'm talking about.  or just check out the show.  it'll do you good.

      it's somewhat bumming me out that 2 in the morning has become ridiculously late for me these days.  i'm regularly in bed between midnight and one.  regularly up by 9:30.  and i don't even have a job.  i mean, if i had some kind of gainful employment that required me to be up and alert at some godforsaken hour (like, uhhh.... 8 or something), that would be one thing...  but to have no actual demands upon my time and to still arise considerably ante-meridian?  christ.  also, i might have to start lifting weights.  it's either that or to start practicing throws from the other side, because judo's starting to make me asymmetrical.  certain muscle groups are getting more of a workout than the corresponding section on the other side of my body...so i'm starting to look crooked.  maybe i should try to even things out now before the difference becomes much more pronounced.  or maybe i shouldn't give a rat's ass.  oh yeah, and finally saw Return of the King.  sweet movie.  (in the "sweeeeeet" sense of the word, and not in the "awwwwww....how sweet!" way.)

      so the good people at tae kwon do have decided to live vicariously through me.  (yeah,  that's  a great plan).  actually, it's mainly the married guys.  one of the women who goes to the school just broke up with her boyfriend, and now there are about 5 guys constantly badgering me about her.  now, keep in mind that she's 32 and has already remarked upon how much of a young'un i am.  reminds me of the last part of Garth's "wake up, you idiot" line to Wayne:  "Okay.  Cassandra's not interested in Benjamin because he's A) rich, B) good-looking, C)  does not live with parents...? "  one of them in particular is keeping an eye out with me in mind.  every time i show up to class he's got some new girl he brings up.  last time it was "i'm tellin' ya, man.  you gotta go get your hair cut at Gallery One.  ask for 'paula'.  i mean....oh man.  wow.  just go!"    which brings us to a potential liability of substitute teaching.  let's face it, girls are dressing sluttier and sluttier.  it's just a fact.  now throw me into the picture.  recall that i'm being accosted every day at tae kwon do about women galore.  furthermore, toss in the fact that as a sub, i'm probably going to be handing out worksheets and then sitting there for 50 minutes of class with nothing to do to occupy my brain.  classes with high-school girls all tarted up for the day.  under those circumstances, just how long do you think it'll take before i start rationalizing "well....i'm only looking.  and only because i'm  supposed  to be watching them.  she's probably 18 anyway."  and what happens if i drop even  that  standard?  it's just not right.  ehhhh - maybe once i start earning some money (ANY money.  i'm not asking for much here.  just some sort of positive cash flow coming my way.) i'll start taking that dude up on his suggestions.  and i guess subbing would provide the required cash, thereby eliminating the potential difficulties.  so yeah, don't start looking for my name in the paper just yet.  no scandals for me!  (and yeah, i know you're all gonna have a field day with this in the comments section.)

      so how about some updates?  i'm still doing judo, hapkido, and tae kwon do.  i've also started going to various classes in the mornings.  by consequence, my sleep schedule has shifted to something that approaches normality.  once it hits midnight, there's a very limited amount of time left to me before i pass out and start drooling on myself.  even on the day's i  don't  need to get up for classes, i'm getting up early.  broke a toe in judo class.  or not.  i'm not certain.  if i did, it was a minor break.  sailed a lot in wind waker.  sooooooo much sailing.  bought a new game and a new memory card for it...and then haven't had time to play it (largely because i feel compelled to finish wind waker first).  got totally shot down by the tv station.  even for the internship - evidently, you MUST receive credits.  "you need to be affiliated with a university and receive credits.  it's a policy.  sorry."  on the plus side, i guess someone at The Hartford really liked my resume.  on the down side, it's gonna be a lot longer before the tkd instructor thing kicks in.  gotta find me some work in the meantime.  master yu told me to look for a job from 7am-2pm...which isn't exactly the easiest thing to find.  ....unless i do substitute teaching.  hmmmmm.  there's a new bathroom in the house - and they actually installed the showerhead high enough for me to use without ducking.  i'm positively giddy over the prospect of showering without hunching over.  got back into starcraft.  man that game's awesome.  i think there's other stuff, but for the life of me i can't remember.

      wind waker is cool and all, by there's just so much sailing that it's ludicrous.  there have been times that i've set the wind in the direction i want to go, raised the sail, then let the boat go while i head off to another room to fix a snack or whatnot.  i think i'm going to pick up viewtiful joe sometime soon.  though perhaps i'll snag mario instead and wait for the price to drop on viewtiful.  of course, there's always Rebel Strike (which just dropped to 29.99), but as i already have rogue leader, mario or viewtiful would interest me more.  has anyone played simpsons hit and run?

      note to self:  make sure to eat breakfast before going to morning judo class.  otherwise you will get lightheaded and have to stop.  also, i'm apparently staying too tight when doing the one-on-one free exercise.  after making a deliberate effort to relax, the green belt i was working with told me "stay loose!  stay loose!"  and so i responded in an i-see-the-error-of-my-ways tone "i thought i was staying loose."  you know, the tone of voice that indicates the conclusion "but evidently i was wrong.  i'll work on that."  BAM!  i'm on the mat.  "don't correct me!"  "that statement didn't contradict what you said" (oh that was a mistake)  BAM! i'm on the mat.  he's an excellent technical practitioner, but he'd be a better martial artist if he'd work with people rather than try to show everyone how superior his skills are.  this goes beyond just this exchange, of course, (and yes, i did correct him the second time, but i told him afterwards that he can throw me as much as he wants, but i contend the first one was not in opposition to his statement).  when practicing, the black belts make sure to guide the lower belts - to let them practice their techniques.  and if something is done well for their level, they go with the move and allow the lower belt to complete it.  this particular green belt gives excellent advice but is incapable of allowing anyone to gain the upper hand - even for instructional purposes.  he'll show you the technique but tell you nothing about the counter...and then he invariably uses those counters when you attempt the move.  more to the point, what does throwing around a guy who's been to 5 classes prove?  congratulations, you have proved your superiority to a white belt over a perceived slight.  well, either way i'll just make sure not to try to talk things out with this particular judo guy.  i'll save that for the black and brown belts.  breakfast time.

      so i had an away message up relating an exchange i had earlier in the day - in a conversation, i mentioned to this guy that i was going to a party, and he responded "do you have a date?" and all i could think was: man, this guy obviously does  not  know me.  (well, that and "dude, that question is seriously cracking me up")  anyway, i put the conversation-snippet into an away message for amusement purposes. eventually, this girl i know IM's me with (and i'm not altering letter-case): "WILL HAS A BIG DICK"  now, i have no idea who Will is.  at all.   so all i can think is "well, gee, that was......germane."  truly a pertinent comment, no?  let's just drive this home one more time for emphasis (and because i know you all want to know.  you NEED to know): i don't have a date to the party...and WILL HAS A BIG DICK.  aren't we all glad we know that now?  (and to be clear, lest you think i'm bemoaning my situation - i don't  want  a date to the party.  besides, with my luck, she'd turn out to be someone else's girlfriend.)

      i went to see  urlLink "Gov't Mule"  at the hippodrome in springfield (MA) last night.  awesome show - warren haynes is one excellent, if under-recognized, guitarist.  allman brother's fans may know him as the second replacement for duane allman, and those of you who own the Dave Matthews: Live at Central Park DVD might place him as the guitarist on "Cortez, the Killer."  bangin' performance - almost three hours long, split into two sets, featuring the most wasted audience i've ever seen.  oddly enough, the highlight of the show for me may have come when i unintentionally quelled some overeager dude with a look.  i mean, this guy's standing behind us yelling "are you ready?   are you ready ???" during a long vamp/jam session.  i hear one of my buddies eventually yell back "yeah, i'm ready!" and soon after my other friend does the same.  next thing i know, i feel someone start poking me in the back, and then hear that dude's voice - "are you ready!?!?!"  so, tired and now somewhat mystified (i mean, ready for *what*?), i turn around and give him what i think is a bewildered look, and then turn back to the stage - only to get MORE confused when i catch a very meek and subdued "....sorry...."  on the ride home allen and adam kept cracking up because i apparently looked like i was going to kill him.  instead of seeming perplexed, i managed to nail the "Don't. Ever. Touch me."-face.

      scrolling through slashdot (because i'm a giant nerd), i discovered  urlLink this  article.  it's a press release from rochester.edu which seems to indicate that the university is finally getting a handle on something they can do to improve dormlife.  when i attended rochester, file-sharing was a relatively new phenomenon, without so many of the potential consequences.  mentally, we probably relate to this period in much the same way the prior generation does to those years after the release of the birth control pill but before the advent of the HIV scare of the early 80's.  in much the same fashion, our nostalgia for that time is tempered by our understanding of the potential pitfalls of similar activities these days.  suddenly, music sharing isn't "safe" anymore.  the same concept of risk-behavior holds true, only now it's not a virus we fear, but the watchdogs of the RIAA.  some people engage in high-risk behaviors, downloading thousands of songs - hundreds of albums, and sometimes they are laid low.  and each time we see someone succumb to the legal web of the RIAA, there's the same feeling of "why was  this  person chosen and not someone else?"  the newspapers even portray them as victims.  there's a clear sentiment in the articles expressing the "unfairness of it all," as evidenced by the preponderance of columns about "little 12 year old Jane who did nothing but love music, but now faces charges that could affect her for the rest of her life."  some might consider the university of rochester to be a sort of safe haven.  personally, i view it more along the lines of paying tribute.  the university hasn't truly put the student body under its aegis - rather, it has diverted the attention of the RIAA to other sources by agreeing to an acceptable payoff.  nor has it likely done so for altruistic reasons - the university plainly has its own best interests at heart.  the administrators recall the scandal at Carnegie Mellon when many of the users were banned from the institution's server for file sharing.  since it would be impossible to  stop  the students from transferring files, the people in charge decided to condone the action instead - after all, the cost of payment is negligible as compared to the potential damage incurred to the school's reputation were the RIAA to launch some sort of sting operation.  and even better, a positive spin can be put on their decision in that the University of Rochester can trump up its commitment to improve the quality of student life on campus.  but hey, given UR's ridiculous conception of what should be included in free cable (your 4 main networks, every conceivable news channel, and court tv), this is arguably a step in the right direction.  so for now, give the university a reluctant benefit of the doubt and wait patiently for their 2005 review of the Napster policy.

      anyway - though running was a giant catastrophe earlier today, the trip to mohegan sun was  not .  first off, mohegan sun is just plain cool.  i'd like to go there even if i'm not gambling, partly because the unintentional comedy level is off the charts.  i mean, how many other places have the "michael jordan steakhouse" where the outside has huge posters of inspirational quotes by jordan himself?  and then there are signs like "Such-and-such Club - Dancing!  Cocktails!  Pizzeria!"   ummmmmm, pizzeria?  that doesn't exactly seem to fit, does it?  actually, that sign leads nicely into the humorous dichotomy in the level of attire.  half the people are dressed clubs, dancing, etc, while the other half are dressed for pizzeria, burgers, etc.  you end up seeing people in grubby boston red sox jerseys seemingly mingling with men and women dressed to the nines.  quality.  and even better?  i actually won money at mohegan for once!  sure, i only put 5 bucks at stake, but i walked out with 12.50.  and i won that 12.50 on my last quarter.  in fact, i did a great job of fouling off 2-strike pitches until i hit that home run.  here's a rundown:  #of quarters in the bucket: 0 #of quarters in the machine: 1  ***spin*** strange combo.  5 coin winner.  not really sure why.    (5 in the machine)....loss. (4).....loss. (3).....loss. (2).....loss. (final coin)....1 cherry. (2)....loss. (final coin)....1 cherry. (2).....loss. (final coin).....1 cherry. (2)......1 cherry, 1 wild.   me: "oh for crying out loud, just put me out of my misery."  (3)......loss. (2)......loss. (final coin).....random piggie bank combo.  shift up to the screen above the slots.  breaks a 10 coin bank.  breaks a 20 coin bank.  breaks a 20 coin bank.  hits a bomb.  total payout?  50 quarters.  whoo hoo!  2.5 times my initial investment!

      i think this winter goes down as the whiniest on record.  the sheer number of complaints about snow and cold must have shattered the previous high - and it didn't even snow all that much, although to be fair it  was  cold.  and  now  people are flipping out because it's snowing today.  wah!  wah!   it's still winter!!!   quit your bitching and put up with it.

      the recent mlb steroid controversy has made many people question whether or not certain players will require asterisks next to their career stats if it's uncovered that they took steroids (notably, THG).  a large number have already started crucifying barry bonds (myself included), practically demanding that if steroid use is unveiled for him that his records should be removed from the books.  now...bonds' supporters (all two of them) counter with the argument that the same treatment should be accorded mark mcgwire if the FDA bans andro.  they fail to understand that when mcgwire's andro use was "discovered", he held a press conference in which he forthrightly admitted his consumption of the product and went on to describe that although he included it in his routine as an additive, the product itself was an over-the-counter item and therefore available to virtually anyone.  if the FDA bans andro  now , it should not reflect on mark mcgwire.  there was absolutely no reason for him to believe that a non-prescription diet supplement would be forbidden by the mlb.  THG wasn't banned solely because the mlb didn't know about it.   andro  wasn't banned because the mlb didn't think it was detrimental to the game.  furthermore, his response to the hype was full disclosure as opposed to bonds' outright denials.  as it stands, although i feel bonds likely has taken steroids, i don't feel it's proper to start putting asterisks in the record books.  however, should an investigative body offer sufficient proof that bonds (or any other player)  has  taken THG, i think the books should reflect that.  and way to go uconn!

      okay, so my friend  urlLink isa  has linked to my blog, and i'm feeling a little pressure to improve the quality of writing found here.  see - thing is...  she writes exceedingly well.  most of her postings feel like they're secretly excerpts from short stories she's written; many of the remaining posts are quotes by such intellectual luminaries as André Breton and Gertrude Stein.  that puts me in a double-bind, because not only is the level of writing several notches above what one finds here, but the posts actually encourage one to think.  so what happens when people link over from her blog to  this  little piece of unadulterated nerdliness?  if eric's blog wasn't also linked, i'd feel like that weird uncle at the family gathering whom everyone feels vaguely compelled to shun.  okay, maybe not that bad, but i'd certainly feel like one of those sesame street "which one doesn't belong?" skits.  now i have to start searching for something intelligent to say on a fairly regular basis.  then again, knowing me, i probably won't bother; it's so much easier to keep my posts nice and prosaic.

      what an asstacular last ten days.  completely sucktastic.  at least i have fantasy baseball to look forward to.  not that it starts for another 3 weeks (grumble grumble)...  and i guess there's a minor plus that i've evidently been channeling the frustration into some serious starcraft whoopass (or whupass, if you prefer).  i'm on a 5 game winning streak, capped off by a 184-1 kill ratio in the final round.  damn you, wraith!  damn you for not escaping those hydralisks fast enough!!!

      Shallow Fest 2k4 continues!  i went to visit a patient at the hospital and was struck by the mind-boggling number of positively stunning doctors, nurses, and physical therapists.  which makes me think - shouldn't some law exist which stipulates that people smart enough to be doctors/nurses/etc aren't allowed to be that attractive?  you know, like Brains x Aesthetics must be less than or equal to some arbitrary value?  it's just not fair to the rest of us mere mortals.  i mean......uhhhhhh.....i'd blatantly violate the new rule.  right.  yeah.

      know what's weird?  apparently,  urlLink gina gershon  (imdb.com) has a band.  how do i know this?  because she was listed as one of the performers coming to the wolf's den lounge at mohegan sun casino.  i actually debated going for twofold reasons.  A: her band was probably hilariously awful.  B: as we discussed in the post below, i'm incredibly shallow - and gina gershon is absolutely beautiful.  and i guess we could throw in C: who am i to pass up an opportunity to blow a bunch of money on a machine that takes my quarters and turns them into a bunch of bells, whistles, and "try again" signs?

      1: had the fantasy baseball draft today.  didn't go great, but it went about as well as could be expected given that i had no time for research beforehand.  2 (and much more importantly): i ran a birthday party for some kids at Yu's Academy.  i couldn't believe the sheer number of  ridiculously  attractive young mothers there.  it made me seriously consider that guy's "single moms are the way to go" plan from "About a Boy."  i mean, wow.  and yes, i'm completely shallow.  3 (and much more horrifyingly): "The man who oversees the cadaver program at the University of California, Los Angeles, was arrested Saturday on suspicion of grand theft, but authorities would not say what he is accused of stealing."

      Yet another parasitic blog post from the Sockless One, who remains too lazy to have a blog of his own.  After several years of saying how cool the sountrack to "Conan the Barbarian" is, I decided to attempt to buy it.  I discovered that it's  way  out of print, and the only reasonble copies on Ebay are used  and  imports.  And the import version has way fewer tracks.  Damn!  I just can't understand  urlLink Varese Sarabande Records , who seem to own the rights to this record.  Used copies of this version are going for $75+ on Ebay.  Shrink wrapped ("trust us it's new and unopened and not pirated") versions are up to $100 on various websites.  Still, Varese Sarabande manages to continue printing such wonderful movie soundtracks as Blade 2, Bowfinger, Bubble Boy, Nightmare on Elm Street 5 (yes,  5 ), Mr. Baseball, and many other lackluster films with lackluster soundtracks.  They even sell several Robocop soundtracks, of which 1 and 3 share the distinction with "Conan" of being Basil Poledouris compositions, though I can't seem to remember Robocop having a particularly compelling soundtrack.  They have lots of soundtracks to bad movies; they have bad soundtracks to old movies; they have bad soundtracks to old, bad movies.  Yet, they won't print a very good soundtrack to a memorable (if somewhat bad).

      of the four main seinfeld cast members, i'd have to say that jason alexander had the best role outside the seinfeld universe.  it was a tough call, given michael richards' turn as stanley spadowski in "UHF" (a very worthy nomination....  very worthy), but you simply can't top "Duckman."  at least, not if you're one of the other members of seinfeld's Fab Four.

      ESPN Classic was replaying the '99 Big East quarterfinals between Seton Hall and UConn, so I decided to tune in.  Now, the game was amazing - I think the max score differential was about 5 points, and almost never more than 3.  But it got me thinking, that UConn team eventually went on to win the title, but two of its seniors never got a chance in the NBA...for no apparent reason.  overall, the team had rip hamilton, khalid el-amin, and jake voskuhl - all of whom played at least one season in the NBA, but what about kevin freeman and ricky moore?  kevin freeman was a monster rebounder - there was one game in particular where he destroyed an opponent with 15 rebounds....10 of them offensive.  that's just plain sick.  he played good defense and could score the ball, but he never got drafted.  why?  i don't know.  maybe because he was a "tweener."  he was the primary rebounder and power forward at only 6'7'', and he didn't have barkley's "round mound of rebound" burliness, so i guess maybe teams were scared off.  secondly, there was ricky moore - the guy who was arguably most responsible for UConn's 77-74 victory over Duke in the '99 NCAA Championship.  i mean, he locked down william avery (stifling the duke offense), and dropped 16 first-half points on the blue devils (jumpstarting the uconn offense).  and let's not forget how he was the one called upon as the defensive stopper when trajan langdon had the ball with the game on the line (or that he forced the travel to preserve the victory).  so why not draft him?  was it because he wasn't primarily a scorer?  he didn't have to be, not with el-amin, hamilton, and freeman on the same team.  keep in mind that bruce bowen is considered an invaluable member of the spurs simply because of his perimeter defense...and he can't score worth a damn.  maybe it was his injury history...but he seemed to adapt exceedingly well to his body's capabilities/shortcomings.  ah well - i just feel like those two got shafted.  other players got drafted and washed out, but no one even bothered to select them and i can't figure out why.

      citigroup appears to be checking my references, so i guess that's a good sign.  employment, here i come!  also, i think i figured out why i like family guy more than futurama the first time through but prefer futurama over repeated viewings.  family guy is so completely random that half the humor comes from the fact that you're totally surprised by whatever happened.  i mean, half the things come completely out of left field.  i could give plenty of examples, but if you've watched the show, you know what i'm talking about.  and once the surprise-factor is gone, the jokes aren't nearly as good.  futurama, on the other hand, has jokes that are well-crafted and fit into the storyline which makes repeated viewings hold up much better.  i'm still happy that family guy is coming back, of course, but i'm starting to wish Fox had picked up another season of futurama instead.

      i read the new york craigslist personals so that i have good fodder to harass eric.  i send him an equal number of legit ones (just to bother him) and really really weird ones (well.....just because).  anyway, there's this "casual encounters" section where people who just wanna get some put up ads and hope other people respond.  couple things i noticed: 95% of the women-seeking-men ads were for paid websites or prostitutes seeking customers.  and the men?  most of those ads were things like "NEED A HOT GIRL TO GO DOWN ON ME!!!"  i mean, what woman's going to look through these ads and think "wow!  i wasn't considering giving head to some random stranger i met online, but i sure am now!  he sounds like a real winner."  i think my two favorite ads were the following though:  1) the "Do you want to go out with a Norwegian Girl" ad where she wrote "must be willing to fly overseas to date me."  2) "bzzzzzzzzz... do u like bugs?" "is there a cute boy who would like to join me at the museum of natural history to make out and look at bugs sometime?"  (i kid you not, it's right  urlLink here .)

      got to play frisbee with dave today.  awesome throwing session.  weather couldn't have been much better, and both of us were sharp.  the really nice part was that it was the first time i've really tested my shoulder at frisbee since i got hurt, and it went far better than i could've hoped.  my forehands were crisp, and my backhands were on the money after my arm loosened up.  even better, i was doing a great job of reading the disc and tracking it down.  in fact, i felt faster than i have in a couple years - it really seemed like i was taking good routes and covering lots of ground.  unfortunately, i managed to tweak my lower back.  it's been great for months, but as soon as i start playing frisbee again......*pop*.  argh.

      it really pisses me off when people start telling me their drunk-driving stories as if it's the Coolest Thing Ever.  three times in the past week i've had friends say something along the lines of "oh wow.  i drove home  so trashed !  it was so awesome" with a glint in their eyes that tells you they're really proud of themselves.  i mean, fuck!  am i supposed to get a little vicarious kick out of this?  you wanna tell me a gleeful little story about how you did something idiotic and put yourself in severe danger - fine, go right ahead.  i'll probably laugh.  hell, i  know  i'll laugh.  but if what you're doing puts other people in severe risk of life and/or limb...  i mean, c'mon.  if you're so blithely self-absorbed that you think drunk-driving is cool because YOU have fun doing it, don't bother telling me unless you have a burning desire to see the Respect-o-Meter plummet.  why not just tell me: "dude - i was playing a new version of Russian Roulette where i've been trying to shoot little kids as they walk by.  it rocks!"  two exchanges from the week:  "i busted through a fence, ran over a mailbox, and slammed into a bunch of bushes in the yard." "and did you stay or just drive off....?" "drove off!"  (on the phone) "i'm gonna leave now before i sober up." "that doesn't sound like the best plan." "well, it's no fun unless you don't get caught."  there are more, but those are the "best."

      i checked my verizon account online, and it said something about 49.99 per month America's Choice 500, 2.99 Caller ID service, 3.99 Voice Mail access, then a couple miscellaneous charges.  so i went down to the verizon wireless store about 5 minutes from here and printed out the invoice i got online showing my citigroup discount and the fact that it said "Caller ID - $0.00   Voice Mail - $0.00" and asked, "hey, what's up with that?"  the guy assured me that since i'm a new customer, the discounts simply hadn't filtered through as yet and that if i checked back in a week everything would be all right.  but then, the next day i received a bill in the mail...for the 49.99/2.99/3.99.  what's up with that?  will i receive another bill in a week or so that has the proper 39.49/0.00/0.00 and the additional 1.99 for the extended warranty?  because i sure as heck have no intention of paying an extra 15 dollars a month.  not even for one month.  on an unrelated note - how was sleep ever a dominant evolutionary trend?

      work seems to be going well thus far.  and somehow a rumor has started in the department that "the new hire is working out really well."  i'm not quite sure  how  this rumor started, but i'm not complaining that it did.  on the down side - no blogging, no webmail, no AIM, nothing.  plus, we're not allowed to purchase things from online sites, and yet the only way we can access certain citigroup discounts is online...  on the plus side, the floor is predominantly female, with my department in particular having a 6:1 ratio of women:men.  however....  95% of the women are wearing wedding/engagement rings or are due to have a child within the next 3 weeks.  also, i'm debating between the sprint 1000 anytime minute regional plan (around 33 bucks) and the verizon 700 minute national plan (around 45 or so).  thoughts?

      a few thoughts:  1) it was pretty chilly at graduation today, but nothing will ever compare to May 19th, 2002......when it  snowed  at mine.  2) what's with the glorified ads for companies at commencement?  mine was for IBM, this time was for Warner Brothers.  3) there's a difference between 'hot' and 'beautiful'.  i'm still trying to narrow down what it is, but it was really bugging me the entire ride home.  i think i've decided that a person can be hot without being beautiful, but i'm not sure yet if the opposite is true.  4) when talking with someone on the phone, saying the following is not very helpful: "yeah, so we were trying to do this thing, but we needed stuff from a certain category and it just wasn't showing up, so it was  impossible ."  5) wow i'm tired.  6) like, really tired.  7) traffic is going very fast when the slow lane is up to 78.  8) i'm glad Sportsguy is back regularly at espn.  there weren't many things more frustrating than seeing a link to a new article by Bill Simmons, only to discover it was a stupid 2-second ESPN The Magazine column.  9) 5 and 6 have convinced me it's bedtime.  first day of work tomorrow at 8am...in hartford.

      usatoday has released photos and  urlLink details  about Nintendo DS, the new handheld gaming thing from....nintendo.  (Allow myself to introduce......myself.)     PDA-type stylus to control games?  (limited-range) wireless action?  compatibility with gameboy advance gamepaks?  sounds pretty rad.

      blogger's new site design is freaking me the hell out.  i guess it's more "accessible" or something, but it's just way too bizarre at the moment for me to endorse it.  busy weekend went well - didn't really need to exert myself too much but somehow ended up scoring 300 bucks in 2 days.  which is nice, because now i can fund my trip to UR's graduation and my upcoming clothes purchases.  i'm thinking that a few polo-style shirts, a couple pairs of slacks, and a pair or two of decent shoes will be adequate.  maybe a button-down shirt or two as well...  i'm also thinking of getting a cell phone.  might be a good idea to have my own contact information, after all.  besides, then i won't have to shell out for a landline/service when i get an apartment.  i'm leaning towards verizon - any suggestions?

      i've been watching TV Land recently so that i can tune in to Macguyver.  good times.  anyway, isn't it weird that macguyver seems to know everyone  everywhere ?  and they all know him?  i mean, this guy's a covert operative and consultant for the phoenix foundation, but every single damn person has heard of him.  it's like that onion article about how "that bond dude must be one awesome spy, since he manages to get the job done in spite of the fact that everyone knows who he is."   Dear Macguyver,  Please save my dog.  I have enclosed a rubber band, a paper clip, and this drinking straw.  Thank you, Peter Griffin   i've also been catching reruns of Star Trek: The Next Generation on spike tv, and i really think that The Traveler was the coolest guest character they ever had on that show.  Q was awesome, of course, but sadly they turned him into comic relief on Voyager.  The Traveler just plain rocked.  plus, he provided the excuse for getting rid of wesley!

      The bickfords i've worked at for almost 8 years now is closing in august.  i'm not quite sure what to do with this information.  i mean, it was my first job, and i've been doing it for so long that it's hard to imagine no longer working there ever again.  there were times in the past where i missed extended periods, but i always knew i would be back at some point.  not any more.  and what about my weekends?  come august, i'm suddenly going to have free time on my hands.  what am i going to do with it?  i'm sort of debating finding another job, but it's just won't be the same (obviously).  anyway, i'm still kind of taking this in.

      I'm talking to Eric about the ridiculous 19-13 Blue Jays game, when suddenly a hand reaches out, grabs my wrist, and pulls the phone away from my ear.  "Friday.  After work.  Club Blu.  Happy hour.  You're coming?"  I gave a somewhat befuddled 'yes' and then returned to the conversation.  Eric:  "What was that about?" Me: "I just got roped into happy day." (pause) Me: ".....'happy day'?"

      so i almost called 911 the other night thinking i'd accidentally sent a javelin shaft (okay, so it wasn't really a javelin, but it's a reasonable approximation of whatever i threw) through someone's neck.  yeah.  not good times.  bad times.  but - at least for eric - highly amusing times.

      Day one: sleepwalking/insomnia  Day two: annoying dream of duration 2 hours or so/insomnia  Day three:  no dreams or sleep/insomnia  i was definitely ready to kill people this morning.  and then i had to sit around and twiddle my thumbs until they finally released the info i needed....one hour before my scheduled departure time.  i ended up having to fucking bust it into high gear for the last hour and then put in an extra 40 minutes on top of that.  but hey, overtime pay!  it's too bad i didn't know i was going to be up all night.  otherwise, i woulda just stayed up watching TV and playing videogames.

      one dream from last night, one dream from the night before.  sadly, the latter capped off a long night of insomnia and sleepwalking.  basically, most of the night i was awake and trying to fall asleep.  the rest of it, i was randomly coming to out in the hall or something.  one of the times i ended up in the hall was because i was trying to escape a fight between a lizard man and an undercover squid.  undercover?  yes.  i mean, it was wearing a trenchcoat and seemed completely normal until the tentacles burst out from concealment.  and last night?  last night i had a long, protracted, guilt-ridden dream about accidentally killing an 80-year-old man in judo.  there was an interminable portion where the octogenarian died a slow lingering death, followed by his widow screaming at me without surcease:  "what were you thinking???"  "he was 80 years old!!!"  " why weren't you more carefull!?!?!? "  not good times.  bad times.

      The Inconvenience of Paying Student Loans  or  How Ronald Reagan and a Weekend Cost Me $13.65  Everything since my last payment on May 14th has been very busy for me.  I went to UR's graduation and then started my job at Citigroup the morning after commencement.  Since then, I've been working three jobs and spending a total of roughly 2-3 hours awake in my house every day.  As such, I lost track of time a little bit and realized on Friday: "Oh crap!  I've got a student loan payment due on the 14th!"  "I'll just pay it online..." - Well, it turns out that you're required to select a payment date at least one business day in advance of the due date.  The due date?  Monday.  Weekend payment?  No chance in hell!  And you're  also  required to choose a minimum two days after the current day...so anything before Sunday is out if you're trying to set it up on Friday.  "No problem, I'll just change my payment date to the 21st..." - Haha.  Riiiiiiiight.  Requires one business day to process!  So, it'll be effective on Tuesday...the 15th.  One day after my payment is due.  "Hmmmm...Perhaps I should call someone..." - 'No operators are available.' ("Oh riiiiiiiight.  Reagan.  Federal day of mourning.  Government agencies closed, including federal loan stuff.  I'll have to call back tomorrow.") 'Please call back Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. through 8:30 p.m.'  Well okay then.  That means no one will be around on Saturday to provide an answer for if the postmark is sufficient or if they must have receipt of payment by the due date.  "All right then, I'll 2-day air it..." - Oh wait.  Reagan.  "Overnight it is!" - 'That'll be $13.65, sir.'  Anyway, to prevent this from occurring in the future, I'm going to set up automatic payment.  I mean, I've got direct deposit from Citigroup so I  know  I'll always have enough funds in my account.  Furthermore, you get a quarter percent off your interest rate if you set up automatic billing.  If this fiasco hadn't occurred, I never would've set that up - so paying $13.65 this time is going to get me to do something that could easily save me many times that amount over the course of the next few years.  Why wouldn't I have done it anyway?  I don't know.  I don't work that way.

      I'm much more saddened by the death of Ray Charles than that of Ronald Reagan.  From what I've been told, they're debating taking Hamilton off the ten dollar bill and replacing him with Reagan.  Now, does this strike anyone else as a trifle...idiotic?  "Hey!  Let's take the guy that founded the Treasury and make it so he doesn't appear on any currency at all!  This is a  great  plan!"  I mean, Benjamin Franklin would make more sense - even though he rocked so hard - because he was never actually president and is more associated with his inventions and the postal service...  But more importantly, why is everyone stopping in their tracks to give Reagan a collective blowjob?  People bring up the hostages...without taking into account that they were released based on IF Reagan took office, and not because of anything he actually  did .  In fact, Carter stayed up all night on his last day as president, negotiating and making certain the hostages would be released.  He called Reagan on the morning of his inauguration to tell him that the hostages had been freed and to congratulate him, and by all accounts, Reagan was distressingly unconcerned.  Let's also consider that Reagan moved back the daily briefing so he could get more sleep (okay, so he was old....maybe he needed it), often fell asleep during meetings (ummmmmm...more sleep?), and at times confused his movies with reality.  This is the man who claimed he had army experience...because he appeared in war movies - who told a story about two men in a crippled fighter plane and related a conversation word for word between the two of them, even though the radio was broken and neither survived, and then looked confused when reporters asked how he could have known what the men said to each other.  And ending the Cold War?  The groundwork for that was laid well before Reagan.  What did he do other than prove that the US could carry more debt than the Soviet Union?  More specifically, what did he prove other than that the SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative...famously called 'Star Wars') was an absolutely inane idea.  And what about the massive recession that his ridiculous economic policies caused?  By all accounts, Reagan was an okay guy.  Fine, I'm cool with that.  But as a president, didn't he pretty much suck?  (and no, I can't wait for all the venomous replies to this post)  (and as another addendum, i wasn't a political science or history major.  i have done research on the matter, but there's a chance that a few of my statements in this post are more akin to paraphrasing than citing direct quotes.)

      In the past 3 days, I have received four voicemails on my phone.  all of them have been from eric.  but...here's the amusing part - every single time i exited my mailbox after listening to the message, i got a "missed call" indicator...and every single time it was eric.  it's actually starting to freak me out.  largely because something virtually identical is happening with my friend adam.  first, he calls while i'm typing his number.  next, he calls when i'm checking a voicemail he left.  lastly, he calls while i'm putting his number into my contacts list.  so yeah, what's up with the mindreading of late?

      Something I like:  okay.....i admit it......i was wrong.  i have no idea why i held out so long, because cell phones are pretty damn cool.  Something I don't like:  how about the fact that my fantasy baseball team is  officially  the DL team at this point?  My starting first baseman, third baseman, and catcher have all been injured at some point and the ace of my pitching staff just got scratched from his start due to a sore shoulder.  i'm pretty sure that involves every player from the first four rounds of my fantasy draft.  incidentally, i've also lost outfielders, a backup shortstop, and pitchers of both the relief and non-relief persuasion.  we'll play this game again soon.

      my manager at work today came up to me and said, "hey, mike - i've got a question for you.  do you have a calendar or something?  you know, one of those calendars?  those one-a-day ones?  like, with words on them?"  aside from the obvious problems in deciphering what the hell he was trying to ask me, i had the added fun of attempting to get past his speech impediment.  eventually, it dawned on me that he was asking if i had one of those "expand your horizons"-type daily calendars that offer up good vocabulary to commit to memory.  i told him 'no,' so he asked if i had "like, a book or something" - to which i also responded 'no.'  i even had to assure him that i was not an english major in college.  it's too bad he didn't go through the simsbury school system, because it would have made perfect sense to him if i replied solely with "i had Mrs. Miller..."  anyway, i discovered that i seem to like the idea of working at the restaurant much better than the actuality of doing such.  i enjoy the job, i like the people around me, and - hey - you can't knock the free food.  i come in for my shift and i'm all bubbly and happy to be there - but now that i have a full-time job, my ability to put up with crap has had the bottom fall out.  as soon as a customer starts being the tiniest bit unreasonable (and the threshhold for "unreasonable" has also lowered dramatically) or the kitchen starts getting a little backed up, thoughts begin running through my mind.... ("i don't have to deal with this nonsense anymore.  what the hell am i doing here?").  and the restaurant's upcoming closing certainly hasn't helped matters in the least, as i'm now firmly in the "what are they gonna do?  fire me???" frame of mind.  ehhhhhh.  i know i'll miss the job once it's gone, but i certainly won't miss nights like tonight.  anyway, i'm going to go have a nice relaxing kitten shake before bed.  later, all.

      somehow, the only interest i've garnered from women over the last few years has been from those with boyfriends.  i'm not really quite sure how that happens...  perhaps they're not happy with the guys they're currently dating and see me as a preferable alternative?  i'm really not sure.  let's see - there was the girl who tried to start something with me after her boyfriend went to italy.  the girl who propositioned me online just after she started dating some dude (she's one of my friends, not some random online quasi-friend.  and yes, she was serious.).  the girl i dated who assured me that she and her former boyfriend weren't dating anymore...a fact of which  he  was unaware.  the girl at the restaurant who suddenly started playing up to me after starting up a relationship with a guy from her college.  and now there's the girl at work who the women who sit behind me insist is "drooling over" me....who has a boyfriend she has conveniently neglected to mention to me.  i mean, hey, i know i'm not making countless women go weak in the knees or anything (keep in mind, this represents pretty much the entirety of female interest i've received for 2-3 year) but i'd seriously like to know what the heck is going on.
