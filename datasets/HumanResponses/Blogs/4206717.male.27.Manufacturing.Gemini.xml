      Most voters believe that Bush is a better foreign policy leader than Kerry would be. This remains a central strength for Bush and Republicans, but in my view, we still have more work to do.  I wish Bush would stop operating on the defensive with respect to the war in Iraq. I fear that he's allowing 3rd parties and external events to define this issue. The plot of the Iraq war currently prevailing in the media, and thus a large proportion of the electorate, is this: Bush says SH has WMDs. Bush topples SH despite strong international opposition. No WMDs were found. The war, and the associated casualties and high costs, was unnecessary after all.  But this plot is missing some key ingredients and so far, Bush is doing nothing to remind us of them and their importance. The central issue was not WMD (nor was it liberating the Iraqi people although that's a welcome by-product of the war). Rather, the justification of war was based on Iraq's decade-long defiance of countless UN demands to open their country for rigorous weapons inspections. Iraq - not the United States - defied the will of the international community. Iraq - not the U.S. - did not cooperate diplomatically and prudently. The U.N. failed and Iraq failed to live up to its responsibilities - regardless of which particular WMDs were or were not in Iraq by the time the coalition forces showed up in Baghdad.  Bush should remind us again and again that in the post-9/11 world, we simply cannot allow dictatorial regimes to defy the will of the world, especially those countries that have histories of WMD and ties to terrorism. International security requires institutions like the U.N. to have meaning, for its words and will to carry weight. The central reason the existence of such institutions as the U.N. is to reduce the uncertainty associated with countries fending for themselves in all matters and to create an opportunity for the expression of a cohesive international will on certain matters, including international security. If the work of the U.N. does not effectively reduce this uncertainty (such as passing resolution after resolution with no binding action for over a decade) or is incapable of coercing outlaw regimes to heed international will, then leaders like the United States must carry the burden of resolving the threat posed by countries that defy international will. America, as the  world's sole superpower, must bear this responsibility because it is the only country capable of doing so.   In terms of weapons of mass destruction, the point is that we don't know for sure what specific countries have or don't have unless the international system of weapons inspections works. If the U.N. is working, no American president should be stupid enough after 9/11 to sit idly by and hope the situation improves without taking some kind of concrete action.  Bush should remind voters about Resolution 1441 and that its vote in the U.N. was unanimous and binding. That resoultion pertained directly to SH's defiance and indirectly to the presence or absence of particular weapons. I think this focus would resonate with those who are concerned about the casualties in Iraq but who still lean toward Bush over Kerry when it comes to dealing with the new realities of terrorism on American soil.   P.S. Bush should also remind us about one by-product of his tough stance against Iraqi defiance - Libya's willingness to give up its weapons.

       urlLink   Our friends on the Left routinely remind us that the Right includes unsavory figures such as Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh whose rhetoric does nothing to raise the level of public discourse in our country.   Limbaugh-Coulter-Hannity-haters often make good points about how these figures merely rattle off meaningless diatribes and make accusations with flimsy evidence (e.g. Vince Foster and Ron Brown were murdered). But in fact, those on the Left don't hate Coulter et al. because their invectives are anathema to democracy or free exchange of ideas or civic progress or a “responsible” discussion of the “issues” that matter, etc. Rather, they hate them for their political beliefs.   If flimsy evidence and loose-cannon rhetoric were the real reason for the Left’s hatred of Coulter and company, the Left would equally hate - and certainly not embrace - people like Michael Moore and Mark Crispin Miller on the Left (the former making  a mountain out of a b.s. mole hill re: links between Bush and the Saudis and the latter claiming that Bush team took no action on intelligence warnings pre-9/11 because it "chose to let those horrors happen for its own political advantage.").   But the Left doesn't hate these people. To the contrary, they embrace them with open arms.  urlLink Krugman  dances around an outright endorsement of Moore, suggesting that he performs an "essential service") by making some good points. But since when did making a good point or two give one legitimate license to whip up some b.s. rumors and spin them out as responsible documentary history?   Once in awhile, even Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh make good points, but this doesn't excuse their underlying nutiness. Krugman's support of Moore is based on his belief that the media haven't been doing their job. But the idea of responsible journalism is that unlike Moore, reporters are supposed to actually gather facts and examine evidence before they can earn widespread acclaim and win major awards. Well beyond Krugman, top leaders of the Democratic Party have joined in the Moore bandwagon. Terry McAuliffe and Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle have publicly celebrated Moore by appearing at the premier of F-11. If this isn't an endorsement, I don't know what is.   To be fair, some on the Left have been critical of Moore.  urlLink Christopher Hitchens  does offer a good critique, and here's an excerpt:     To describe this film [F-11] as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. To describe it as an exercise in facile crowd-pleasing would be too obvious. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity, crudely disguised as an exercise in seriousness. It is also a spectacle of abject political cowardice masking itself as a demonstration of "dissenting" bravery.   At the end of the day, the Left's outrage about Hannity and Coulter and Limbaugh et al. is outrage of a political - not moral – flavor. This is fine, but they should abandon their self-serving feigned outrage-rhetoric suggesting that underlying their constant criticisms of Limbaugh et al. is some kind of moral high-ground idealism and just acknowledge that their dissent with these figures is based on fundamental political disagreements and nothing more.

      I like this Obama character:   "In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here-the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. The audacity of hope!"

      email from Coz:   AAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!! People are so fucking stupid.  I really can't wait till I die.  Case in point: if you wanted to know how hell was, you probably wouldn't ask satan, cause he'd probably say that the weather's fine 365 days a year.  SO then why the fuck do we get news quotes like this:  "We're confident in the statistical confidence of the program," said American Meat Institute spokeswoman Janet Riley. "We think it is an extremely comprehensive program."  of course they're confident!  to put it in context, people are saying that the mad cow testing is inadequate and critics to that say that it would be too costly to test more efficiently and that current testing is good enough.  And looking at the AMI website, it looks like these people are the Teamsters of meat industry.

         “Oh my gosh, dude, I just saw him!”    I said.                  “Who?”    Asked Stew.              “The soup nazi.    He just got out of a car and walked right by me on the street.    He didn’t really look like the soup nazi, but it was definitely him.”                  I was on the phone with a leading member of a national power-broker syndicate.  But now, I hung up and walked back inside the Baja Fresh…toward a destiny of fame…              I saw Heather get introduced to the Soup Nazi by the director.    But they walked away before I got all the way inside.    I didn’t want to seem over-eager.    I didn’t want to just walk up and say, Hi, I’m [capshine].    I’d hang back and wait for just the right moment.    That’s what BC would do.                  I worked the crowd.    Said hi to some folks.    Meandered my way over to SN.    Eventually, I was standing next to him.    I smiled, he smiled back.    He went to get a Coke, and I sat down at a nearby table.    He came back and sat at the table right next to me.                  I looked over and said, “hi, I’m [capshine].”    He shook my hand and said it was nice to meet me.    He didn’t introduce himself.                  Then I looked over again and said, “So, are you enjoying our nation’s freaking capital?”                  That line was a big gamble.    It was going to be a reject or a slam dunk.              “Oh, yeah, I should have brought my son though and made more of a trip out of this.    He’s never been here before.” – SN.               “Well, speaking of firsts, I’ve never been in a commercial before.” – me.              “Oh, it’s alright.    It is a lot of work just to make a little bit of film though.    It’s kind of crazy that you work for 8-10 hours for something and it gets turned into 30 seconds of video.” – SN.               By this time I was noticing his mannerisms and accent and tone of voice were not at all like the soup nazi on tv.    Weird.    It really is acting.                  He went on to tell me about some other commercials he’d been in and that he’d been in a episode of Scrubs, and that they had cut a lot of the filming in that show also.    He also said that the only show he’d ever done where they kept most every shot they cut was…SEINFELD.                  Later someone pointed out to me that I should have said, at this point, “oh you were on Seinfeld.”    But that didn’t occur to me at the time.                  Anyway, he was the first to raise the subject of Seinfeld.    He talked about it a little bit.    He mentioned it was frustrating to be known for one part in one show 9 years ago (can you believe it was that long ago?!?!).    Up to this point, it was just me and him talking.    One to one with the Soup Nazi!    But then some other people started to drift up, including the director of the commercial and H.                  SN told the director he was hungry and asked if there was any place he could walk to for something to eat.    The director said he’s send someone out.                  “Well, we can send someone up to the Silver Diner [where I once dined with Stew].    They have sandwiches, burgers, and…soup…no pun intended” – H.              “haha…NO SOUP FOR ME!!!” – SN.                  We all laughed.    It was going to be an amusing night.                  It was also going to be a long night.    The details of the shoot are not too interesting.    The sum of it all is that 2 slices of pizza, 6 Reeces’ cups and 1 coke later it was 3:30 AM and I bugged out.    Ugh.                  Another Ugh is that I don’t think you’re even going to be able to see me in this commercial even though I was sitting right next to the Soup Nazi as he was acting.    But they pull the camera so close in for the shots, you really can’t see anything around the subject.    I might be in the picture for a minute at the beginning when the show the whole room.    Other than that, I really don’t have high hopes.                   The premise of the commercial is that the soup nazi is a sort of food cop, symbolic of the government who stands at the front of a line in a fast food joint and tells people what they can eat based on their weight.  It looks like it could be pretty funny and memorable.  I’ll let you know if I find out any info on when and where it’s going to air.

      This one's for Noah:  Apparently, the Soup Nazi character was based on an actual soup vendor named Al Yeganeh, who runs Soup Kitchen International in New York City's midtown area. Yeganeh dislikes the Soup Nazi label, but he is renowned both for his excellent soups and for his rude treatment of customers.  The original SN has a  urlLink website , of course, which includes a link to "rules":  FOR THE MOST EFFICIENT AND FASTEST SERVICE  THE LINE MUST BE KEPT MOVING.  Pick the Soup You Want !

      Saturday, I went to Mike's groupie's birthday party (he has a groupie because he's in a rock band and all guys in rock bands have groupies).  There were like 15 people there and I realized  as soon as I arrived that I shouldn't have come.  There were all these rock band people there talking about the virtues of various riffs and chords and lalala.  "Dude, you gotta listen to this solo...it's just like Megadeath on their 5th album..."  So, basically, it was like being at a party with people speaking a foreign language.    I was worried they were going to break out a dungeons and dragons board at any minute, so I went out onto the porch seeking solace.      There, I had a girl tell me that she liked corrupting cute guys like me and leaving them crying for more.  I laughed because she was ugly, old, and trying to hide it.      I went to get some snacks, but all they had was M&Ms and a little veggie tray.  When I went back outside, all the rock band guys were trying to get "the corrupter" to kiss some other girl on the lips and offering her money to do it.    That's when I left.  But not before noting that "the corrupter" did not actually kiss that other girl.

But he apparently can’t help himself:  **I had hoped to be back here this week under different circumstances, running for re-election. **…You know the old saying: you win some, you lose some. And then there's that little-known third category. **…I know from my own experience that America is a land of opportunity, where every little boy and girl has a chance to grow up and win the popular vote.  **The first lesson is this: take it from me -- every vote counts.  **And never forget: that power is yours. Don't let anyone take it away or talk you into throwing it away.  **And let's make sure that this time every vote is counted.  **Let's make sure not only that the Supreme Court does not pick the next President, but also that this President is not the one who picks the next Supreme Court.  **By the way, I know about the bad economy. I was the first one laid off.  **And while it's true that new jobs are being created, they're just not as good as the jobs people have lost. And incidentally, that's been true for me too.  **To those of you who felt disappointed or angry with the outcome in 2000, I want you to remember all of those feelings.

      From the NYT article Stew sent me this morning:    "I'll try to continue farming, but there's now the allure of getting out with a little bit of dignity," said Mr. Pridgen, 59, who said he expected to receive about $202,000 from a buyout. "This is just compensation for someone like myself who's spent the last 40 years farming. It gives me a little more hope."    Let me get this straight, this guy worked his whole life growing tobacco and he needs a tobacco buyout to get "just compensation"?  What about the money he made selling tobacco all these years?  One part of what I find frustrating about the tobacco buyout is the sense that somehow tobacco farmers have been doing our world this great favor by growing tobacco all these years and that now we ought to be paying them back.  Sure it's good for people to have jobs, but:    1. Arguably, smoking causes more harm than good in our society - prooducing a net economic drag associated with health care costs  2. Tobacco companies can buy tobacco more cheaply abroad  3. Why are people entitled to government re-distribution of wealth?    Am I missing something here?  Are tobacco farmers really some kind of benevolent society that has been helping us for all these years without compensation?      If they didn't feel like they were getting fairly compensated for what they were doing, why didn't they do something else?  Indeed, many of them did, which is why they left farming and the quota has gotten concentrated in the hands of fewer larger outfits.      I've also heard a lot of talk about how Burr needs to work on a tobacco buyout in order to appeal to people "down east".  But will enough voters be pleased enough to vote for a candidate based on buyout support?  Will this bloc of voters make a difference in the election?  How big of a voting bloc are these farmers, anyway?  Potential paper topic, Stew?    Certainly people from my part of the state are suspicious of a buyout and would probably considering voting against a candidate for supporting it.  I certainly would, depending on how the buyout was financed.

Miss Stone, 46, wanted to enjoy a lesbian moment with her co-star, but the current conservative climate in the country just wouldn't allow it, she concluded, according to Ireland Online.     "Halle's so beautiful, and I wanted to kiss her. I said, 'How can you have us in the movie and not have us kiss? That's such a waste,' " she said.     "That's what you get for having George Bush as president."  First, let's buckle up our pilgrim boots for a review a couple movie/TV sexcapades from the past couple years:   1. The Brittney-Madonna kiss 2. The Janet Jackson "wardrobe malfunction" in the year's most watched programming 3. Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is a big success 4. Obession over the Paris Hilton sex video 5. Ellen and Rosie have talk shows...UGH!!!  Not exactly material for a Jonathan Edwards sermon here.  What exactly do these super-stars fear from the Bush administration and other right wingers?  Perhaps that they will boycott their productions.  But would that happen any more or less under a Bush Presidency?   Without an analytical study, I would estimate that there has been a rise or maintainence of sexual innuendo in art from the Clinton years.  I would also say that there has been an increase in homosexual behavior in entertainment.  One wonders how much more homosexual content there would be in TV/movies if John Kerry were President.  Oh my!  On a philosophical note, if Sharon Stone wants to kiss Halle Berry, why doesn't she just do it?  No one has ever seriously suggested during the last couple years that people cannot make out on their own time if they want to.  Why does Sharon Stone need a movie as an excuse to kiss someone she thinks is beautiful?

      Someone once asked:  "There are lots of people out there on both sides that are reasonable, well-intentioned politicians. Why hasn't anyone started a 527 that gives to moderate progressives in both parties? Is that even doable?...why hasn't somebody tried crossing party lines. forget third party, why not transend parties and fund anyone who's good."  This is a semi-typical question/complaint.  Here's my input.   1. Duh...who's "good"? 2. People that work in politics often have honest, deep dislike of people on the other side. 3. There are plenty of facets within each political party so that moderates can have political success just by associating with other moderates.  Moderates from opposing sides do sometimes work together, but when they do it seldom seems to be as an official organization.  It is usually based on mutual udnerstanding or a limited common cause.  4. Parties are very powerful and exercise a lot of energy to hold their members together.  It is  very difficult to advance in politics if you're not identified with one or the other.   Stew, what do you make of all this?

      Or something like that.  NRO has a good  urlLink article  out about Bush hating. Here's an excerpt:   Another common error is the idea that a connection equals a cause — call it the Michael Moore Fallacy. Bush bashers invariably point to his family's business dealings with the oil-rich Saudi royal family, or to Dick Cheney's former job as head of the oil company Halliburton, and therefore assume that the administration's policies toward Iraq are dictated primarily by the fact that the country sits on billions of gallons of oil. But playing connect-the-dots in order to prove someone's motives is always tricky, and often absurd. For example: Noam Chomsky's book sales have skyrocketed since the invasion of Iraq; Chomsky teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; MIT is a major contractor for the Department of Defense; the Iraqi war strengthens the Defense Department requests for budget increases.... Therefore, Noam Chomsky conspired with the Defense Department to convince President Bush to invade Iraq.

      War has begun...  (from the hotline today)      Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a 527, has launched today a 60-second ad in WI, OH and WV charging  John Kerry  "lied about his war record, had engineered the injuries that led to combat medals and was unfit" to be pres. The group will spend $500K running the "stark ad" as "part of a multimedia effort to discredit Kerry's wartime record" ( La Ganga / Braun ,  Los Angeles Times , 8/5). Here is the full script of the  urlLink ad  produced by Stevens, Reed, Curcio &amp; Potham (R) ( Wilgoren ,  New York Times , 8/5):   JOHN EDWARDS  : "If you have any question about what John Kerry is made of, just spend three minutes with the men who served with him." TEXT:  "Here's what those men think of John Kerry." ENSIGN  AL FRENCH :  "I served with John Kerry." LIEUTENANT  BOB ELDER : "I served with John Kerry." LIEUT. CMDR  GEORGE ELLIOTT : "John Kerry has not been honest about what happened in Vietnam." ENSIGN  AL FRENCH : "He is lying about his record." MEDICAL OFFICER  LEWIS LETSON : "I know John Kerry is lying about his first purple heart because I treated him for that injury." GUNNERS MATE  VAN ODELL : "John Kerry lied to get his bronze star. I know, I was there, I saw what happened." LIEUT. JG  JACK CHENOWETH : "His account about what happened and what actually happened are the difference between night and day." REAR ADMIRAL  ROY HOFFMANN : "John Kerry has not been honest." CMDR  ADRIAN LONSDALE : "And he lacks the capacity to lead." LIEUT. JG  LARRY THURLOW : "When the chips were down, you could not count on John Kerry." LIEUT.  BOB ELDER : "John Kerry is no war hero." LIEUT. CMDR  GRANT HIBBARD : "He betrayed his shipmates, he lied before the Senate." LIEUT.  SHELTON WHITE : "John Kerry betrayed the men and women he served with in Vietnam." GUNNERS MATE  JOHN PONDER : "He dishonored this country, he most certainly did." LIEUT.  BOB HILDRETH : "I served with John Kerry. John Kerry cannot be trusted." ANCR: "Swift Boat Veterans For Truth is responsible for the content of this advertisement" ( Hotline  transcribing, 8/5).

      I can't recommend the 9/11 Commission Report strongly enough.  I'm only about 40 pages in, but it is fascinating and disturbing.   I was under the impression that the U.S. government and the FAA have precise information about aircraft flying in our territory and had the ability to locate planes.  Apparently that was not so, since there were several reports on the morning of 9/11 of other hijacked planes in the air that simply did not exist.  Most shocking was that the plane that hit the Pentagon did so with virtually no warning.  Despite the earlier attacks, no one had ordered planes to circle DC and protect the capital.  There were only a few planes off to the west and some planes on the ground preparing to go in the air.   Spooky.

      Hilarious Op-Ed by John Keegan in the Daily Telegraph. This guy is perhaps the most sympathetic to the "American Empire" of all British commentators, and one of few Britons who might actually say nice things about  their  former empire. He's the one who bucked the crowd and predicted 1)a really easy win for the US in the Iraq war, and 2) a continuing insurgency after we won.     Anyways, he's SO (amusingly) right:   urlLink  Spain lost Gibraltar 300 years ago today: it should get over it

      From the entrance, the civil war battlefield at Sharpsburg looked like a brightly lit stained-glass window.  It was a bright blue panel over a shimmering green panel.   The battle of Sharpsburg took place in 3 stages, and so did our tour on Saturday.   First the video stage.  We viewed an ancient movie narrated by James Earl Jones that explained the context and development of the battle.  One video had Monty Python-esque scenes of man after man getting shot in the face and spurting blood.  Apparently all wounds at Sharpsburg were head wounds.   After that we went around the battlefield for about 4 hours.  Most of the time,  I  was having an off and on intellectual conversation with some bearded sage in our group.  It left me longing for a trip to the old Carolina Coffee Shop (not the remodeled one).  As we stood at a shallow ditch where a line of confederates held back a yankee assault of thousands for hours, I realized that in spite of the video and map and introduction by the park staff, I have no appreciation for the scope and layout of the battle that day.   About that time, a random guy came up to one fellow in our party - who happened to be black - and said, "you know, this was all for you, right?"  Stew, this reminds me of your Pearl Harbor story from the bus in Boone. I hope you will re-tell it to us in the comments.   Phase 3 of our tour was surreal: We walked to the top of a 60' tower in the middle of the battlefield.   For an hour, we stayed in the top of this tower, which was an area of maybe 12' x 12', taking pictures, talking, admiring the brigh blue sky and the shimmering green grass bending in the wind.  We watched a storm blow by miles to the south and saw its rain falling like a blurry gray sheet hanging from the sky.  We were on the world, but not of it.  The earth turned beneath us.   By the way, I'm converting to Eastern Orthodox.

      Man oh man. The BC team can't even successfully issue a terror warning without escaping serious and warranted scrutiny. What's the deal? The LAST thing we want is to make it look in any way as though our side is politicizing something as fundementally and importantly non-political as evaluating and reporting terror threats. But these days it seems that we're damned if we do and damned if we don't. Raise the warning level and we are criticized of politicizing terrorism. Don't raise the warning level and, well, we're not making the country safe in the face of new threats. This sounds like one of those game theory matrices in which the dominant strategy is an inefficient outcome.

      OK, I've done just a bit of investigating and gathered some points that  might  help explain some of the thinking behind the Keyes campaign. Pretty much, the spectacle of it all pins Obama down in Illinois, preventing him from touring the country campaigning with Democrats in closer races. Also, among all potential candidates who could do this, Keyes is that colorful character who could best spook Obama into making mistakes; and the glowing reviews Obama has thus far gotten perhaps haven't prepared him well for recovering quickly from mistakes. Take Keyes' dogged criticism of Barack's dropping his idea for six debates--the media hasn't let Obama off the hook yet. He's still flippant and hasn't quite understood yet that the race, such as it is, has now begun. Speaking of which, the first debate would almost certainly be an Illinois geography and history quiz. Keyes is a quick study and in any event he also has an excuse to not know the answers; a goof then by Obama might sting worse. (He isn't a native either and hasn't been here a  great  deal.) Anyway, with apologies to former general Borling (Bore-ling!), one of the last alternatives standing, Keyes is probably better at this. Who else could've finally turned the spotlight away from Obama, and turned the media against him, if only just a bit? And apparently this plus the Democrats' clean sweep of 2002 has left the rest of the Republicans maneuvering here for other statewide offices in 2006. Some didn't wish to have a U.S. Senate loss this year on their record; the rest are content to see Alan fly home to Maryland in three months leaving no one else here with a head start at the next round.  Maybe. Not that anyone has told me Keyes could win either. At this point I'll settle for a good time.

      The first and second sentences are irreconcilable:   "Given the circumstances surrounding the affair and its likely impact upon my family and my ability to govern, I have decided the right course of action is to resign. To facilitate a responsible transition, my resignation will be effective on Nov. 15 of this year."    So these "circumstances" will likely "impact" his "ability to govern", but the citizens of NJ must be deprived of an effective governor until after Nov. 20? Answer: to avoid a special election, which in NJ is required only if a governor leaves office fewer than 60 days before the next scheduled election, which this year is Nov. 2.  So even in the governor's worst hour, a day that is no doubt crushing to his family, especially his wife - the man makes yet another decision that is not in the best interest of the state he supposedly serves.

      Last night, I steeled myself against anti-Bush rhetoric and headed out to see Sonic Youth at the 9:30 Club in North DC.  It was awesome.   Nothing beats watching Thuston Moore and the gang flip out hard and abuse their guitars to make them make all manner of electric sounds.   I saw them do the following with their guitars:  Swing them around in the air Beat them with drumsticks Scratch sticks up and down the strings Lay on them Rub them all over their bodies Rub their strings against the strings of another guitar  For those of you who aren't familiar with this group (I'm guessing all of you) they started in like the mid 80s and had some hits.  Pretty influential in making modern rock what it is today, though they were never huge.    I also saw Kim Gordon, their bass player blast a flugelhorn, or something like that and jump around in high heels.  Wild stuff.   Anyway, they're pretty liberal and have been involved in some Bush protests.  So I was expeting to hear a little hate Bush talk there.  There was a little, but mostly from the crowd.  Thuston was definitely egging people on in sort of an indirect way.   I have yet to conclude a comprehensive theory about how and when it is classy for artists to express their political views.  As a general rule, I think it's sort of poor form to preach to audiences who pay money to see you perform.  Other than that, I am still generating rules of politeness on this subject.  Naturally, when I complete them, I will expect others to adhere to them rigorously and disdain those who don't.  Suggestions?

      I noticed that  urlLink Congressman Goss' webpage   is currently overloaded (or perhaps just 'down'). I don't think most of us had heard of him before last week, but today he's chairing a meeting of the House Intelligence Committee.

Too bad this didn't all go down six months ago--Congressman Burr could have taken the helm, which would have been a nice feather in his cap as he runs for Senate. He's too busy campaigning now (and Capshine appears, not unreasonably, to have written him off).

      Wait, stew, try  urlLink this : We were puttering along the Chicago River, watching paddlers from the Flatwater Classic float by, craning to see the tops of sundry architectural marvels.

The stuff splat heavily on the deck, dousing dozens of white-haired ladies and gents in nylon windbreakers.  There was confusion.  Then the smell hit us.  An unmistakable stink: porta-potty juice.

      Hey, how's this for comedy?

"That was a special for in-state residents," Obama quipped. Har, har. More: "So let's see," Keyes said. "Before I came on the scene, Barack Obama thought of himself as if he was in the same class as Lincoln and Douglas in the critical drama of American life. And now he realizes that he's not in that class.  "Well, I think that the state of Illinois remains in that class. . . . And I think that it is a disservice to the people of this state to allow him to cower in timidity, and before the real historic challenge that is before us in this campaign." And Q &amp; A with the board: Where will you live in Illinois?  We're kind of looking at south suburbs at the moment. That would be for the immediate. But over the long-term, I can't say. . . . My wife and I will consult about this and then she'll tell me my opinion. Finally, the Alan Keyes  urlLink eBay man , if you haven't already heard: "I noticed that he was sweating up a storm," said McGlothlin, a local publicist. "So I took a napkin out of my pocket, blotted the sweat from his brow and said, 'Welcome to Chicago.' "  McGlothlin, a Keyes supporter, preserved the napkin in a plastic bag. He plans on donating money from the auction to the Keyes campaign. By late Monday, the auction had been viewed by almost 7,000 people and the price was up to about $250.  "It's historical memorabilia," he said. "It's something worth framing." I report, you decide.

      I love how the major party standard bearers re-invent themselves once the primary season gives way to convention season. For example, compare the rhetoric of GWB at Bob Jones in SC to his rhetoric at the convention with the veritable rainbow coalition of diverse speakers and words of compassion. Also consider, for example, Kerry's "evolution" (from the WSJ):   Redefining Benedict  Alert bloggers have picked up on some subtle airbrushing of the John Kerry website, belatedly catching up with the candidate's transformation from Howard Dean manqué to confidence-inspiring moderate. The father and daughter team of John and Jessie Rosenberg at www.discriminations.us report that all website references to Benedict Arnold CEOs have been carefully revised. The phrase now applies only to executives who move their companies offshore as a corporate tax dodge. Previously, it had been used to slap around any executive who sourced production overseas, benefiting enemy workers at the expense of Americans.  So what else is new? Around convention time is when every Democratic nominee disowns the ranting, populist self of the primaries and recruits a gaggle of corporate bigwigs (ideally former "lifelong Republicans") to testify to his fiscal moderation and sobriety. Sure enough, "CEOs for Kerry" was splashily unveiled last month, and even earlier he had less than artfully disowned his Benedict Arnold soundbite as the product of "overzealous speechwriters" -- notwithstanding a long trail of quotes suggesting that Mr. Kerry used the phrase in ad lib statements, everyday conversation and on TV talk shows.

      "I am the light that is over all things...Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there." Gospel of Thomas # 77.  Just 5 minutes from my house, right along the Potomac runs the Potomac Heritage Trail. The trail was my weekend. There's only like 4 people per mile there and none of them are weird homeless dudes, like you'll find in Rock Creek Park or the C&O Canal.  It's just crowded enough not to seem sketchy, but enough solitude that you can find a nice place to ponder the meaning of life, which I did.  60 feet of rock spilling from the GW parkway over a period of decades marks the entrance to a rock wonderland.  After passing this demolished entrance to the trail, I walked for miles alongside soaring cliffs, periodically dissected by streams flowing down to the river.  At one point, I heard loud crackling deep in the woods and sensed a large cliff nearby.  I crept my way through the dense forest and saw the gray of stone materialize from behind snaking green vines.  I approached a large cliff that was crumbling down a big hill.  It looked like it had been crumbling this way for many years.  I scrambled over the preamble of bolders and felt the cool air blowing off the crackling water as it poured down the rocks.  At the top of the cliff, I saw a hollowed out throne of rock - the source of the trickling stream seeking its way through the bolders down this hill.  I climbed to it.   A 30 foot sheer, smooth rock wall like the back of a seat, clad in a sheet of water was at the top of this stream.  Kneeling at the bottom of this rock, in front of the falling water, I saw the past, present, and future flowing by as one entity.  Isaiah must have secreted himself in some place like this when the fire and wind and earthquake passed before God at the mountain at Horeb.  He must have found solace between tons of stone that could crush him any second.

      Ugh.  There is some serious jockeying for position here in my office.  The implicit hierarchy is being realigned based on who is trusted to do what kind of work.  So far, I seem to be coming out ahead.  I'm being allowed to correspond directly with clients, do analysis, and I'm getting a new computer.   It's kind of a precarious balance because it involves making sure that I am too busy to do dopey projects but am available for projects that involve thought.  Another thing I have to do is ask for work from the VP that will allow me to do more advanced work.   Miymoto Musashi ("the way of the warrior is the resolute acceptance of death") says that we must cross at a ford.  Literally, that means using a shallow place to cross a river.  It also means that any chance you get to accomplish a difficult task for a discounted amount of work, you must take.   I crossed at a ford yesterday to get unfettered access to a laptop.  I got to take it home to do work there.  Today I crossed at a ford to get a new desktop PC.  I pointed out how the slowness of my machine was holding up work for my boss and then strongly hinted to our independent contractor tech guy that "I probably need a new computer, right...right...right?"

      He's not wimping out after all, it seems. Steven Spielberg's film adaption of Israel hunting 'n killing the Palestinian terrorists responsible for murdering its Olympic athletes at the 1972 Munich games is  urlLink going forward :   urlLink The New York Post  recently ran some gossip that Steven Spielberg's "Mossad" project was delayed due to concerns over terrorist threats to the production. Well,  urlLink Spielberg Films  has let it be known today that there is no truth in the Post's story regarding the film's delay, period. Steven Spielberg's spokesperson Marvin Levy cleared up the matter today with the following definitive truth:  "Thanks for checking with us. The NY Post story was wrong about the speculation about the delay. It is and has been the script pages which continue to get to Steven almost every day. That's the reason for the delay" Levy said. The Post story (along with many other sources) have also been calling the film "Vengeance", although it has been made clear a few times from DreamWorks that the project will not be specifically based on the George Jonas book "Vengeance" (although DreamWorks/Universal has optioned the rights to Jonas' book as it potentially is one of the contributing sources to the project). Good news. And huzzah for Mr. Spielberg! Hopefully he'll retain Ben Kingsley despite the delay.

      If you haven't seen it before, this New York Times  urlLink interview  amuses and also casts some doubt on whether the issue of the day matters much:  As a professor of economics at Yale, you are known for creating an econometric equation that has predicted presidential elections with relative accuracy.    My latest prediction shows that Bush will receive 57.5 percent of the two-party votes.    The polls are suggesting a much closer race.   Polls are notoriously flaky this far ahead of the election, and there is a limit to how much you want to trust polls.    Why should we trust your equation, which seems unusually reductive?   It has done well historically. The average mistake of the equation is about 2.5 percentage points.    In your book ''Predicting Presidential Elections and Other Things,'' you claim that economic growth and inflation are the only variables that matter in a presidential race. Are you saying that the war in Iraq will have no influence on the election?   Historically, issues like war haven't swamped the economics. If the equation is correctly specified, then the chances that Bush loses are very small.    But the country hasn't been this polarized since the 60's, and voters seem genuinely engaged by social issues like gay marriage and the overall question of a more just society.   We throw all those into what we call the error term. In the past, all that stuff that you think should count averages about 2.5 percent, and that is pretty small. That would be a great deal more than Clinton ever got. He didn't break out of the 40's. As Volokh  urlLink points out , the questions are sometimes silly and they seem to "(1) express surprise that a scholar who is trying to describe the world would reveal (not just in political editorials, but in his scholarship or in his teaching) a truth that he himself finds politically unwelcome, and (2) implicitly criticize the scholar for expressing this truth (since this truth may, heaven forbid, influence people to vote in a way that he dislikes)." It could just be tongue-in-cheek.

      A friend of mine shared this with me, and I wanted to pass it along:  I know it's been a long time since I've had any new lingo for any of you guys, but I've recently stumbled upon this great new African American phenomenon that I wanted to share with you.  It's called a "babymom."  Now keep in mind, my research into this entity is still in the preliminary stages, but from what I can gather, "babymom" appears to be a simple contraction of the common English phrase "baby's mom" or "baby's mother."  This term is used to refer to any woman who has conceived of and given birth to one of your children, but who is neither your wife nor your girlfriend.  For example, "I was at my babymom's yesterday..."  or  "His babymom work at Walgreen's..."  The 's' in the middle is always silent, and any further slurring or truncating of the phrase such as "babyma" is allowed and, in fact, encouraged.  So far I've come into contact with this phrase only twice.  The first time was when one of my young black patients came in with concerns that he may have an STD.  He was wondering whether he may have gotten it from, or passed it on to, any of his partners including (but not limited to) his current girlfriend and his babymom.  The second instance was last night in the emergency room, when a blood-soaked 30-some year old black man was carried in by his friend after having been shot in the buttocks outside of the ER (next to the parking lot where I park my car, incidentally).  In relating his story to the police, the friend explained that they had been hanging out at the victim's "babymom place," sitting on the porch, when the victim's ex-girlfriend's boyfriend came up with a gun and shot at him as payback for a prior altercation.  I'll keep you posted as I unravel more of the tale of this exciting new discovery!  In the meantime, feel free to begin incorporating "babymom" into your own dialogue, wherever you may find it useful...  Ever in your service on the front lines of the great racial divide,  --Gabriel

      Volunteered for W last night at the Arlington County Fair.   I discovered some problems with party staff folks that I just don't understand.   One, I got to the table at the fair and I was supposed to be handing out bumber stickers and lapel stickers for you shirt.  I had like 30 of each.  That's right.  30.  I handed them all out in about an hour.   I was told to ration them - giving only one to each adult.   But that's sort of ridiculous, because, hey, 30 bumper stickers are obviously not going to last even one night, so unless its a feeding the 5000-style miracle, we're going to be short anyway.   This got me thinking, what's the point of being miserly with campaign paraphrenalia?  Give it out.  This may be some person's only contact with the candidate before they vote.  You don't want to tell them, "sorry only one sticker, sir".  Dumb.  Second, some girls came up to work for the GOP Congressional candidate.   The same person who told me to ration the stickers wouldn't let them behind the table to campaign for their candidate.  WTF?  She told them to go walk around with their stuff.  But they couldn't had out anything as they walked around - county fair rules.  Plus, when the girls stood at the front of the table to assemble their stuff, the same lady said they couldn't stand in front of the table.   Why all the rules?  Ugh.  I'm going to complain to somebody.

I wouldn't expect the current governor to go on the attack against a candidate who is less known than himself.  To me, that seems like a sign that Easley is really afraid of Ballantine.  Easley has the initiative and control over the state agenda, why doesn't he campaign and play some positive ads about himself...unless, of course, he has nothing positive to say for his first 4 years.  Which goes back to my point of his being afraid of Ballantine.

      Wow! Keyes answered a question recently at a news conference by, er, making the  conservative  case for slave reparations: Keyes gave a brief tutorial on Roman history and said that in regard to reparations for slavery, the U.S. should do what the Romans did: "When a city had been devastated [in the Roman empire], for a certain length of time--a generation or two--they exempted the damaged city from taxation."  Keyes proposed that for a generation or two, African-Americans of slave heritage should be exempted from federal taxes--federal because slavery "was an egregious failure on the part of the federal establishment." It's a self-help program promoting saving/investing, without extracting wealth from others or growing government bureaucracies, and rights the historical wrong of the de facto 100% tax on slaves and its affect on their descendants, he said. That is, until he eliminates the entire income tax that he says enslaves us all. Heh, what a guy. I guess it's his minority outreach or something?

It is not odd now to imagine that they would one day seriously inconvenience our troop movements, so why take the risk?  Also, that the plan shows Rummy and co. are as influential as ever and cling still to their view of technology as a wonder force multiplier, neglecting the need for  quantity  as well as quality soldiers at least in post-major combat pacification phases.  So, Stratfor says they haven't really learned the lessons of A-gan and Iraq. Hrm.

      From  urlLink Newsweek  via MSNBC  HOTTEST FOR FITNESS University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va. Long before the invention of the treadmill, Thomas Jefferson, the founder of UVA, wrote: "A strong body makes the mind strong." UVA follows that adage by offering both varsity competitors and weekend warriors some of the best fitness facilities in the country. Associate athletics director Mark Fletcher says 94 percent of all students use one of the four indoor recreation centers, which together make up 300,000 square feet of pools, running tracks, weight rooms and classrooms for yoga and kickboxing. The school also maintains a 23-acre park for outdoor field sports and jogging.  HOTTEST FOR HEALTH CAREERS University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C. One of the top public universities in the country, UNC-Chapel Hill offers students a choice of more than 50 majors. But what really draws future doctors, nurses and other health professionals is the opportunity to study at a campus with all health disciplines in one place. The School of Nursing and the School of Public Health both have undergraduate programs. At the School of Medicine, undergrads can earn degrees in radiologic science or clinical laboratory practice. With all these resources, it's not surprising that biology, psychology and nursing are among the top majors. Linda Cronenwett, dean of the School of Nursing, says "a history of collaboration grew up that enhanced the work of all our disciplines." Go 'Hoos!

      This  urlLink article  is one of many critical indictments of charter schools that only casually and somewhat indirectly mentions what is the central point. Students whose parents move them out of traditional public schools into charter schools do so for a reason - either there is something perceived to be bad at their 'old' schools or they believe there is something desirable about charter schools. Further, many charters come about solely to serve "at risk" students, so comparing charter test scores to traditional public school test scores is misleading at best.   From a research design perspective, what is needed is to treat students as units of analysis (not schools) and randomly assigning equivalent students to charters and to traditional schools and tracking their performance over time with repeated equivalent measures. Absent this, be very suspicious about these kinds of voodoo reports because charter kids are by definition not equivalent to the larger public school population.  Public education is fraught with problems - not the least of which is that they are immune from the competitive pressures of the market. Ineffective teachers are very hard to fire or demote yet receive the same pay as "teachers-of-the-year". Pay is low, mitigating the ample supply of talented labor. Discipline is a major problem and the 'behaviorally challenged' consume significant school resources. No Child Left Behind has some market-like incentive structures but they are school- (not teacher-) based. So the idiot teachers who are teachers because they have no other labor market options are lumped in with the high-achieving, inspirational, and innovative teachers. Plus there are too many administrators and in my view, too few parents willing to play an active role in the education of their children.  A mess.

      He opened "Hardball" by saying the adminsitration wants to move some forces from Germany and Korea to free them for perpetual war against the Middle East.  Now, we are establishing Iraqi bases permanent in all but name, and from them we may one day strike Syrian or Iranian WMD sites, or simply supply opposition movements there covertly, and gaining such leverage against al Qaeda enabling states was almost certainly a major reason for Operation Iraqi Freedom, but Iraqi Freedomesque, multi-divisional WAR WAR WAR? Talk about tin foil hat territory.  Then he said: But al Qaeda was in Germany! Gee, so we should keep a jillion M1 tanks there to surge through European streetcorners and shell mosques or something? Sad. He excells at domestic politics, but since 9/11 he's been a fish out of water on foreign affairs.  But then a soon-to-be demonstrator at the Republican convention told him BUSH LIED! So you're saying George Bush is brilliant. Everyone in the world believed there were WMDs in Iraq but he knew there weren't. He's so super smart, ya think? ... I do this every night. Everyone thought there was WMD, kid, but you're very good for a crazed demonstartor Ha! So does it take a kook to know one? He's still OK. What a mixed bag though.

      I've never been more steamed about terribly biased NPR reporting in my life. I try to like NPR, but I just heard a story (not the first) that drove me bananas. I was shouting in the car.   The audio link is  urlLink here . Here's the gist: a pro-life man in Florida is alleged to have listed his telephone number in the yellow pages in the abortion providers section along with the name of his fake abortion services organization. To women that called his listing seeking abortions, he would string them along until it was too late for them to have an abortion.   They interviewed women who said they called the man early in their pregnancies to get an abortion and since he never called them back and strung them along, they were forced to actually deliver the baby (eight and a freakin' half months later!) because the delays made it too late for an abortion.  Geez, the men who fathered these children probably didn't have to work hard at all to convince these naive ladies that "everybody's doing it."  Maddeningly, the "reporter" didn't ask: "Gee, why didn't you just pick up the telephone and simply call another abortion provider after several weeks of being strung along?" No comment was available from the children that had the audacity to be born as a direct result of this man's anti-abortion scheme.  And then, the very next story was about an "anti-abortion-rights-activist" group (I think that means "pro-life". I had to turn it off.

       urlLink Here's  some real incentive to talk about your life on this blog.   I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't have posted some of the stuff 'over there' that I did.  It's irritating that you start one of these things intending to have the same level privacy you would expect from emailing people, without the hassle of having to mass email every time you want to tell a story.  And then you hear about things like this where people post other people's private blogs. That seems kind of low to me.  What would be the possible advantage of posting the blog of another that was obviously meant for the consumption of a few select people?  Character assassination or calculated stardom seem like the only two possible reasons.   I would consider the contents of this blog to have the same significance as a story that I told you personally.  I would not expect it to be the subject of mass-dispersal, unless it was something a reasonable person would think was clearly not confidential.   Anyway, you all really should read this article.  It's a startling take on the lives of young people.  Mostly, I think that articles that review people's lifestyles are a little misleading.   Fortunately, all my stoires are made up anyway.

      He again  urlLink staggers me . It's akin to his approval of Arafat's 1996 election. Each of us can name the last half dozen or more failed U.S. presidential candidates, but who remembers whom Arafat faced? And what chance did they have? Uh huh. Carter confirms Chavez survives vote  CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN) -- Former President Jimmy Carter, in Caracas to help monitor a referendum on President Hugo Chavez, said Monday returns show an effort to recall Chavez failed.  His monitors conducted a quick count at polling sites and the results were "almost exactly the same as the results" provided earlier by the National Electoral Council, Carter said at a news conference...  Before Carter's announcement, the opposition insisted the results were a fraud.  "We will count the votes again and we will formalize before the international bodies a very complete petition to audit all machines, to count every single paper ballot and to physically examine the elements that took part of this electoral process," said Henry Ramos Allup, the leader of the opposition coalition. "An incredible fraud has taken place." Carter to comrade-o Castro's opposition:   Sit down and shut up  .

       urlLink Dun, dun!  State Sen. Barack Obama and his Republican opponent, former presidential candidate Alan Keyes, crossed paths on Chicago's North Side at the Indian Independence Day Parade.   "Barack sounded like he saw Mr. Keyes and thought it would be nice to introduce himself and welcome him to Illinois," Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs said.  Even with the chance run-in, which began with a handshake, both men showed themselves as candidates who would not back down, continuing to grasp hands as they exchanged barbs only inches from the other's face.  "The sad truth of the matter is, one test of a candidate, I believe, is that you say what you mean and mean what you say," Keyes said in an apparent reference to Obama now committing to only three debates instead of the six he had sought before Jack Ryan withdrew as the GOP candidate.  "I always do," Obama shot back. That Gibbs guy later said, "I do not believe there will be a voter left in this state that will not understand the differences between these two candidates."

      Hey, if you're looking for a  urlLink reason  to go there: Voices hush around the patio table as Rick Lamborn poses his first discussion question during a Christian youth group meeting at a popular restaurant.  The topic this night is consistent relationships, and Lamborn begins by asking the college-age group, "How does inconsistency negatively affect your relationships with others?"  As responses sprinkle in, a blonde in a tight white tank top and orange hot pants quietly scoots up to the table. She joins the discussion for a few minutes then has to scurry back to her boisterous customers inside.  Interactions like these, that bring faith to the uninitiated, are one of the reasons why Single Focus Atlanta has chosen to meet at a Hooters restaurant every week for the past four years.  "We've seen a few of the waitresses become Christians. One of the former managers here became a Christian. So it's worked. The whole object, in reality, is that this is just to get inside the door," said Lamborn, whose nondenominational group invites all those who are curious to join their Hooters sessions. I've never been to one, but I heard the waitresses really do sit down with you and chat you up while your food is cooking.

      Big Pharma spends like $35 billion on R&D per year. My first question is, if stem cells have such promise for curing diseases, why aren't more profit-seeking R&D firms doing lots more of it? If they're not, is it because they don't believe the probability of success is worth the extraordinary cost and risk? Is there some special reason that the market is not an appropriate indicator of untapped profit opportunities here? Anyway, why are we waiting around for government to do this research?   The second question/comment pertains to the ethical questions surrounding stem cells. The aspect of the JK's political stem cell position that is most disingenuous is that he presents what is ultimately a false choice. Surely he is not suggesting (is he?) that there should be no ethical bounds on human scientific activity for the sake of searching for cures. After all, we all agree that Alzheimers is terrible and its cure highly desirable, but at what ethical cost? What are the tradeoffs?  JK's rhetoric conveniently leaves no room for discussion of what these ethical limits should be. I am more than a little frightened by a guy who says he believes that life begins at conception (when talking to the Sunday congregation) but who nonethless breathlessly laments GB's essentially moderate, pro-life position on stem cell research. In championing (and probably exaggerating) the potential of stem cell research, he conveniently avoids discussion of what explicit ethical framework that he believes should guide this kind of controversial research. JK's view would simply force taxpayers - many of whom find cultivating and destroying human embryos unconscionable - to pay for this research. Should we use public funds to clone embryos in the name of research, too? Where is the line, JK? If you want to make an issue about this research, then share with us your position on where (and whether) ethical lines should be drawn. What  is  off limits?  The ethics of stem cell research does not present easy questions for either side. For example, those of us with ethical/moral reservations about harvesting embryos in the name of research really need to learn more about the ethics of legal in vitro fertilization techniques that discard embryos. That apparently happens every day. I'd also like to know more about  adult stem cells.
