      The first book on philosophy I ever read was the Bhagwad Gita. I was 18 at the time: confused about many things, ignorant of far more; far more than the ones whose ignorance I was aware of. That time in our lives when all you can do is struggle to stand still while a million impulses rush in, a time when there really was only the present in focus, the past a blur; a million islands amidst the turbulent sea. No place to drop anchor. The future non-existent, defined by everything that cannot itself be defined. Every move a prelude to a fall. Every thought a sculpture of ice. Every ambition a sand dune.  It was then that I first became aware of the recursiveness of the reality around us; sometimes manifested in the hypnotism that is the fractal, sometimes peeking through the endless cycle of cause and effect, mocking at the philosopher who ends right where he begins - the source of his beliefs - elated at the wonderful sequence of thoughts and arguments that so simply, suddenly, undoubtedly and completely fell into place (a beautiful theory, marvellous in its constructs, sly in its assumptions, impractical in its suggestions). The pattern of rise and fall, compression and expansion, struggle and release, life and death, the singularity of infinity, the duality of its derivatives in the real world.  Every answer to the question of the origin of our existence, every definition of morality, every philosophy of consciousness, every psychology of behaviour seemed to be a cautious, perverted, cowardly attempt of a human mind too afraid to accept the simple fact that everything was a projection of what the mind chose to do. The whole world a chaos of thoughts thrown out by the mind, in reaction to the perception of those very thoughts by the senses, trained to respond in a manner consistent with the expectations imposed by years of evolution and training of the same mind that controlled them. An endless loop, a fly wheel constantly accelerating, a vibrating system in resonance, forever seeming to multiply in amplitude, mysteriously never failing under the stress. It came down to the question everyone has been asking for hundreds of years: what are we doing here? A question asked as many times as it has been met by a flimsy attempt at an answer. So much so that it has become cliche to even think about it, one more thought confined to the attic, conveniently ignored. Yet the thought rages on, finding new victims as they arrive into the world, returning to us as we grow old, when the pleasures of the world have grown stale, when all things material have ceased to satisfy us...  Sigh. Anyone?

      So, I've got my  own blog !!!  Yaaaaaay!!!         Umm...I am still kinda thinking what to write in here. For a long time I didn't entertain the idea of putting up a blog...I mean what does one write? And who has time to write everyday and who's gonna read all this? I mean seriously, people have better things to do other than open up someone's blog and scrape off some of the trash that someone else just threw up, right?  Apparently not.  I don't know what this blog is gonna look like. Honestly, I might even use this blog to just  urlLink learn to talk non-stop without having anything intelligent to say . One of the weirdest things is the fact that my lab mate  urlLink Elijah  does blog research, writing papers like this  urlLink FOAF  thingy (What? FOAF doesn't seem related to blogs? Well I am not getting paid to write all this either : ) And I can only hope that this blog isn't one of the things that he uses in his research cuz doing Stemming, Stop Word Removal on this one will result in  null .  Ok, now that I've eliminated any chance of my blog being widely read by such a lame intro, (and actually managed to write so much without making sense, achieving one of my goals already), I think I'll just move on and find something more useful to do in life, like read Salman Rushdie.
