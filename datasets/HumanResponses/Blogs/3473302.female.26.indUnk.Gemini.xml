      Even the almighty took a rest on Sunday, but not the GMNC.  For them Sunday is just like any other day, another day to nag the single into becoming coupled, another day to see how far they can push me before I either storm off or cry (haven't done that yet).  Desi's have an issue with weekends...they just cant seem to fill them up with enough activities, thus dubbing them MBA weekends. (marriages, birthdays and akhandpaths) If you're brown your saturday is spent attending some next relatives wedding, and sunday an akhandpath (or puja for my hindu friends out there) for a new baby, a new house, a new job, the basement being renovated, the fact that Bunty spoke his first word, the fact that Bubloo got his license, the list is endless. This weekend was no different, got up sunday went off to an akhandpath, and got asked by many aunties that dreaded question "so Beta, when will I see your wedding card?" I was ready to scream when it arrives in the mail you shall see it, if you aint old and blind by then.  But I was good I refrained.  Why oh why cant someone ask me how I'm doing or hows the job hunt going? The questions that actually mean something. Ah well.   Well I thought I'd gotten my fill at the path, but boy was I wrong, got home to my mommy telling me to make a list, well two actually - one listing all my good qualities, and the other all the characteristics I was looking for in a mate.  She wants to put up my profile on those darling websites that I mentioned in another post (dont worry when and if I put them up I'll let y'all know so you can all have a good giggle).  So looks like there are new tactics in play, some a little more underhanded than most...will keep you posted as to new developments.

      Logically one would assume I'd be happy with the antics of the GMNC but through this entire ordeal (ok ordeal is a harsh word but it works in this context) there are a few truths about my family that I have learned:  1. Some members of my family are blind. 2. Most members of my family know nothing about me. 3. Marriage in our community means not just the union of two people, but of two villages of people. 3b. Villages have their share of idiots and the not-so-sane (not quite insane, but getting there). 4. Never judge a man by his parents - sometimes even parents screw up. 5. The Indian community has a lot of men suffering from  urlLink Oedipal complexes . (Ok not to the extreme degree, but we sure do have a lot of mama's boys). 6. The word "homely" means something completely different in English than it does in Punjabi. 7. A personality is not necessary in order to get married.  Actually can sometimes be a hinderance. 8. If you're not a DLET or in computers, you need not apply, because in the brown world no other career is valid. 9. My parents can be quite intimidating. 10. I don't know how to play the part of the demure, coy, chai-carrier.

      Last year around this time, most likely because wedding season had begun in the S.Asian community, the GetMarriedNow Cult was formed.  I think it was started by one over anxious cousin who really cant wait to get hitched, but for some reason can't until I do...ah well, maybe I'm holding out subconsciously just to spite her. hmmm... Ok so the GMNC began with some subtle hints the "you'd look so pretty in red/pink/fuschia" (no brown woman looks good in fuschia no matter what parents say).  To date I'm aware of the international scope of the GMNC, it now has operations throughout Canada, the US, the UK and a very small contingent which noone listens to (I know how they feel) in India.  This organization, as the name suggests, has only one goal in mind, the finding of a "suitable boy" for a reluctant bride.

      Well I've been told that I need to provide some bkgrd, dont know why, I'm writing this more for me, then for anyone else who is reading it. Well the bkgrd - didn't do the rat jams, the brown jams or attend many brown-esque functions - did an occasional diwali dinner, or a baisakhi dinner, but nothing more - most of my friends are not Indian - well not Punjabi.  I avoid the stereotypical brown scene like the plague...yep I know I'm a snob, been called that many times before - but dont care.  I wear my indian-ness with pride, I just don't do it the way others do.  I enjoy a good Indian author, I've read everything from Rohinton Mistry to Anuradhati Roy to Khushwant Singh - I enjoy the desi vibes (currently have Desi Vibes by the Dum Dum Project in my CD player).  The problem with my attitude or lack there of is that I have chosen to avoid the one community that my parents, though liberal in thought, still expect me to marry into. So what's a girl to do, I guess I'll just have to endure this terrible fate of marrying a "suitable boy".

      Have you ever been in a situation where no matter how much you struggle - the noose just keeps getting tighter?  You try to run, you hide, you try everything in your power to escape the torment but it still keeps coming at you from all angles.  Well take that feeling multiply it by a thousand, make it a daily ritual and you pretty much get the idea of my nightmare.  A nightmare that for me (and many others I know) is one rooted in reality.  Forget the good mornings, and the general niceties you've been used to, I go through every day hearing the mantra " you're going to be 26 soon, when are you going to settle down, and you know get married " - say that with an Indian accent, and a bit of a head tilt and you've got the image of every Auntie, Uncle, Grandparent, and non-relative in my life.  The best and most persistent of the 'GetMarriedNow' cult is of course my mother, who has taken to surfing matrimonial sites like sikhmatrimonials.com, and shaadi.ca...I honestly think she has it ingrained in her mind that if I don't find that perfect Sikh boy within the next few months that I will end up an old woman with cats.  Needless to say that will never happen - I don't like cats! And will someone, anyone please tell me why 26 is considered over the hill?  From what I can tell, all my body parts are my own, I don't need meds to stay alive, and ok so I have a few grey hairs but those only came into existence about a year ago when the 'GetMarriedNow' cult got its charitable organization status.  ARGH!!!  Ok so why the blog about my partial nightmare existence - simple no-one listens to me anyways so why not put my issue out there in the world for no-one to pay attention to. Mom if you're reading this, I know that by the time you get to this sentence, you'll have forgotten what the whole thamasha was all about, so I have nothing to worry about.

      Have you ever had a moment when you think you're doing something fantastic only to reflect back and realize holy shit what the hell did I do. Well had one of those moments today.  Had my momentary lapse yesterday when I decided to listen to the GMNC and dye my hair a semi-regular colour, but knowing me I never do semi-regular...they said change it back to desi-brown (aka blackish) so I went and dyed it indigo, yep indigo...frick its dark...I look like a brown goth...and now I'm stuck with it for at least 2 weeks, coz my hair is fried and my hairdresser refuses to bleach it down to a normal colour.  The GMNC is going to be the death of me.  You cant escape them, even at an intimate bbq, they're there lurking the background waiting to pounce and tell you about some random guy. Or better yet, the GMNC is now virtual, the emails and the instant messages from around the world are probably my favourite.  I always find it weird when an email shows up in my inbox from the pindh, first you wonder if its a virus, or just a joke, then you realize that your pindh back home, which barely has sewers and clean running water, has bloody internet hookups...for petes sake I can barely get rogers hispeed to work most days and the pindh has net access 24/7.  I personally think its a GMNC conspiracy there trying to shut me down as I expose their every thought ... aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I told you there out to get me married by any means necessary.

      unemployment sucks! and it doesn't help the whole plan of slowly destroying the GMNC. Now its beta I know the perfect job for you, many nice boys work there, maybe you'll meet someone.  ARGH!! Frustration overload being processed, will take another day or two to recover....did I say ARGH already?

      Ok so it's getting close, and I mean real close to the day that I dread - my birthday!  It's not a significant number this year, well not in the grand scheme of things, it is however in the minds of the GMNC.  You see this year marks another year that I have not announced an engagement or announced plans to get hitched, which to them is another failed year.  Wait they never said it was a failed year, they just sigh and give me that look like I just kicked their dog or something.  Ah well..*sigh*  So yep the big day approaches, and as usual I have no clue what I really want to do for it, I have an idea that was formulated on the basis of good friends, good food, and a couple of drinks, but who knows how that will work out.  Birthdays are not my favourite time of year, they force me to reflect on what I've accomplished, or what little I have done in the grand scheme of goals I have listed to do before 30 (and that doesn't give me much time). I still have to see the pyramids in Egypt, watch a footie match - a real footie match, sit through an entire cricket game, scuba dive (learn to swim first then scuba dive), learn another language (thinking Farsi or Spanish any suggestions?), there is so much to do and so little time to do it in.  ARGH!

      Flax; wheatish; mocha; cafe au lait; cappucino; chocolate; chestnut - all colours our community uses to describe themselves.  Uhm ok, so I've been trying to figure out my shading for these profile thingy's.  So this is what I've figured out thus far: I'm fair, but most of me is pasty, except for my face which is just fair, hell it gets most of the sun and when its not bright red due to burns its a nice shade of pale almost transluscent flax?  See my dilemma.  What in the world does flax look like?  So I did some digging and some research and this what I found:   Wheatish  - refers to an almost yellowy brown (see wheat council  urlLink website ), light almost beigy tone  Flax  - is a messed up one, the flax flower is actually blue and white, which if that was what you were referring to as your colouring would imply that you look like a sailor, but then the again the flax seed (see the flax council of canada  urlLink website ) is a wee bit darker than the wheatish tone, but still has the yellow underpinnings, actually not a bad colour to be I guess??!!?!? mocha - a little richer in texture and in colour, more of a pink underpinning to it cafe au lait- lightest of the coffee colours closer to a beige but with a little bit more flavour sorry colouring cappucino- more frothy than the first two coffee based colour, and the medium rich tone of the three chocolate- uhm dark brown chestnut- reddish brown, the colour of a rich wood  then there are variations of all these tones, which I think is just silly.  We're brown, we're either fair, light, medium, medium-dark, dark, or uhm not brown anymore.  Have a wonderful day trying to figure out what range you fit in, if for some reason you're still not sure as to your exact tone, visit your local mac counter and a salesrep will help you out.  If you're a guy and feel strange talking to a cosmetics rep try your local Home Depot Paint expert, and ask them what Benjamin Moore colour your closest too.  If you haven't figured it out by now, I'm being sarcastic, I feel that whoever came up with this particular section on the profile page, is one hell of an SOB and needs to be spanked and I dont mean in a good way.  :)

      At one time I knew I'd have a following, who knew I would be the leader of the refugee free world, the master of the immigration status, the unbeknownst queen of the cougars.  Why are the brown boys of India (and I mean the backwater villages of India), the green card seeker-students of the US and the young boys (under 23) responding to my call for a husband?  Where have all the nice, charming, clean-shaven (I hate that term, but it makes sense here), sober(ish) Sikh men gone?  I know our parents are all part of the baby boom, and in all technicalities there should be just as many boomer children running around, and we're Indian we believe in big families, but where oh where is my so called better half? That is if he's remotely brown.  Ok so I've tried to convince my supposedly liberal parents that maybe they need to stop pressuring me to marry a specific type of brown.  Brown is a lovely colour, unless you step in it, and there are many shades, from flax, to wheatish, to mocha to chocolate.  Ok that's another bone of contention, will write about that later.  Why do I have to stick to the Sikh shade of Brown, why not gujju? or marathi? or bihari (the only men in the world hairier than sikh men -  another question, why did waheguru cover the sikhs in shag carpet, what was s/he thinking ?)  Ok that's all I have to say about that for now, but please how is it parents can become the most pendhu people when it comes to their own kids, but can advocate the 'mixed marriage' and liberalism to everyone else? Ha riddle me that Batman!

      Nothing to report, am bored with life and am beginning to believe that I should just buy a cat and settle into life as a spinster.  Life would be so much easier without responsibilities and obligations, I want an island and to live like a hermit!!  Someone save me from this nightmare of ennui.

      Ok so this blog is a little later than most, but its not like anyone notices the times on these things.  It's always the small details in life we overlook.  The busy worker ants we only notice them when they invade our home and take over the kitchen; the small dandelion in the lawn, again we only see that when it germinates and takes over the lawn, creating havoc and pain in the wallet as you buy fertilizer and weed killer; the little people who we only notice when we trip over them and land flat on our face.  Well last night was a strangely calm night, may have more to do with the fact that I got home pretty late from work.  Went to hear a speaker discuss Interactive TV and its implications on the Broadcast medium, sounds boring but is absolutely fascinating.  Imagine not only putting in SMS text messages...ok I'll stop there its probably really boring to the non-tekkies out there.  Well as I said last night was calm, but this morning my dad out of nowhere lets me know that I will get a job next week.  When did my dad become a mystic, is there something that my family has failed to tell me about my ancestry?  See now how do you write that up in a matrimonial ad.  JSF seeks JSM. Tall, fair complexion, brown eyes, ever changing hair colour, may have mystic tendencies ...yep that's gonna get a whole lot of contacts - mainly from mother's asking "oh mystic one, what do you see in my son's future? Will he marry a 'homely' kuri?"   Damn those homely girls!

      Ok was on the subway this morning, making my way into work, reflecting on my existence etc...etc...and reading a fantastic book called The Transplated Man (read it-it's fab).  So there I was reflecting on the fact that every day I get on the subway I see the same people, but I know nothing about any of them.  It's interesting that we all go through life passing by the same stores, the same banks, the same people yet we never pause for even a brief moment to make contact with these people.  Have we become so insular that all we care about is the couple of feet that surrounds us (our comfort zone)?  Ok now back to me and my dilemma - kidding. Ok so there is this one part in the book I'm reading that every brown woman and man should reflect on.  It tests the theory of India as being the floating element of Pangaea. The question posed in one chapter is what would have happened should our floating homeland have decided to merge with say South America instead of Asia. What if India jutted out of Brazil?  How would we be any different?  Would we be any different?  Would our parents be less likely to cry besharam if a girl wore a short skirt?  Would our men be less hairy?  What if....

      Ok I think I am starting to see the light, not the light I thought I'd see, but the one my parents have been waving at me, the light of interrogation.  Last night was able to avoid the  'lets write out your biodata'  speech, well actually didn't avoid the speech, just avoided the actual writing out of my biodata.  And why is it no matter how long your parents have lived out of India, when they say " biodata " it is always with an accent.  Well unbeknownst to my mother I took the plunge and posted on one of the many matrimonial sites, yes I have put my profile and "biodata" on the web...and lets see what happens.  And yes I recall mentioning that I would let y'all know which site so you could giggle with me, but I've lost my nerve, however, if you can figure out where and what nickname I'm using, hmmm maybe you'll win a prize (KS: you cant comment, coz I told you where it is...don't you dare!!).  So, in a 24 hour period got a couple responses - not bad, not bad at all.  Well until I checked out their profiles and come on guys if I'm taller than you by a good couple of inches, do you honestly think I'm going to respond.  And another thing, I live by the five finger rule - not that rule dingbat - the one where if a guy is over 5 years older than ya, then there may be an issue, that's getting into early to mid thirties, and uhm, ye I have the maturity level of a 14 year old, so that aint gonna work.  Ok this cynic is off to try and do some real work.

      Ok how is it possible that people leave the house and assume that they look good.&nbsp; I am no fashion-ista, but hell I know what looks good and what looks like sheer OMG crapola. I realize that ppl are entitled to wear whatever they like, but if there is a law against indecent exposure why cant there be one for exposing me to certain looks especially during lunch.&nbsp; The hurl factor was high today during my lovely lunch with my co-workers.   There are simple rules that people need to follow and based on today's lunchtime observations should be LAWS:  1. Denim: use sparingly, and with caution.&nbsp; If you attempt the denim on denim look please I beg of you DON'T or at least&nbsp;match (reference any hip hop video from the 80's and if ur look resembles that don't wear it outside) 2. Red lace shirts are just wrong. 3.&nbsp;Tie dye is ok on children and hippies, not on slightly bald, badly blonde dyed chubby men. 4. White shirts with coloured bras uhm ye no thank you.  There are many rules of thumb, but honestly please think about others as you step out into the world each morning - if your outfit scares your children, your neighbours or your dog, its a pretty good sign that you shouldn't be wearing it outside of the four walls that make up your home.

      Ok completely off topic but people keep bickering about the brownout of Canadian Television, and I thought its about time I vented. I am sick of ppl telling me that the scape of cdn. national tv is starting to glow in mutlihues of brown. I agree that there are quite a number of brown faces on cdn television but is it just me or are they all relegated to reading / reporting the news or telling us all how the weather is going to be.  That and there are a ton of ethnic programming geared at the south asian especially on those days when we're all at home doing nothing, yep those MBA weekends are now having to compete with the tens of shows dedicated to the south asian viewer.  Yet ppl are crying foul and that media is overloaded with faces that don't reflect the true diversity of canada and is focussing on only one group. To that I say screw you! Hypocrisy seems to rear its ugly head when the group in focus is not the visible minority of the moment. After over a hundred years of contributing to this country a few brown folk finally get their mugs on telly, thanks to dedication, education and a ton of hard work and someone decides enough, they've reached their quota now who do we move on to.   I realize that visible minorities as a group are not equally represented in anything, especially screen-based media, but I'm just tired of the continuous spotlighting of one group or another by some lobby group (read freaknut) who are / is trying to get their 15 minutes of screen time. Recently a fantastic and much needed stats study was launched that looks at employment trends in screen based media, it's a study that everyone should look at and understand that at the end of the day neither our government nor our screen based media industry justly reflect the Canadian diaspora. (study can be found at  urlLink http://www.wift.com/publications.html   Its hard to swallow at times but we haven't come that far (baby) yet. There's still a lot to be done, and a lot that needs to be taught to the media industry, the most important lesson is that what we watch needs to be more reflective of who we are. I grew up with shows like Full House, Family Matters, Who's the Boss?, not exactly the typical brown household, but I coped, and think I've got a pretty decent idea of both the western and eastern worlds. (ok before I go into " in my time " mode lets move on) Well on that note, lets hope shows like  Nevermind Nirvana  actually make it to air in the fall and can hold on to at least a (if not a couple of seasons)...   I don't expect anyone to read this, or to care, but honestly I'm proud of seeing the brown faces on telly, its about time that I saw someone I could identify with - so what if there just telling me to wear a raincoat today, or that Dalton McGuinty is an idiot and has broken yet another promise (that's another rant), but still they are names I trust and know..so to Karen Johnson, Robin Gill, Anwar Knight, Merella Fernandez, Francis De Souza, and all the others who I cant remember at this time, thank you and keep up the good work.

      I hate the flu as much as I despise the antics of the GMNC, but not as much as I hate the idea of retarded brown men and the 'booty-call'.  Ok this particular post is in retaliation, not to something that happened to me, but to a friend, and not a friend like in the sitcoms where the friend is actually the person speaking but this is in actuality a friends issue.  Come on, have you been reading my posts, I don't get booty calls from brown men. Ha! I'm amazed if a brown guy recognizes that I am indeed a brown female.    Ok moving on...here's the dilemma - where has the romance gone in our community? What happened to the art of woo? Is chivalry dead? Has our society, especially our community, gone so far into the gutter that asking a girl out for a drink should automatically imply that on the second date that there will be some horizontal/vertical (whatever ur flava is) action. Come on promiscuity is one thing, but do guys honestly think that every woman is something to conquer?   But that to me is not the gravest part of the problem, the gravest and most horrific part is that men still want to date the whore and bring home the nice good girl that mommy and daddy will approve of. A "hanjee" kinda girl - or at least one who can fake it. (and as most brown females can attest, we can fake most everything.)   Maybe I'm wrong in my assumption, maybe out there somewhere there are good brown men that don't have the IQ equivalent to that of a mule? But of them we don't hear stories, they remain hidden, kept under wraps by those women who do know them, attempting to ensure their survival and well that they get the good ones in the end.  Anyways, to my friend I say this, the man is an arse if he didn't buy you a drink the first time, and he's an even bigger arse for making his booty call via e-mail...who does that anyways? So everyone support bacteria, it seems to be the only culture some people have.

      There is only so far you can run before you end up caught or tired. I think I'm going to go with the latter. The GMNC is on hiatus for a bit, as I think they've found there is no pleasure in pushing the marriage routine on someone who wont fight anymore. So I've had to take up the cause myself. It's funny how things end up coming full circle; actually its like the GMNC is using some reverse psychology measures to get my sorry arse to do something about this whole being single thing.  And another thing, since when did being single become such a curse. I realize there's this whole panic in my family that as a woman I'm aging rapidly (though no quicker than anyone else in the world), and the whole must have babies to ensure the growth of the community (blah, blah, blah) bit, but if Madonna can have babies in her mid forties, and my aunt can get married in her mid thirties, why should I have to follow the tired example set by so many desi women, who have decided to get married at a younger age. Honestly, what do you know at 22 or say even 25 that makes you ready for marriage, for a commitment to one person/one cause, to be able to run a household and to ensure its a happy one. Come on, there are too many things I want to do before I start having to get permission or ensure that my partner will do them with me...how many brown guys out there would be comfortable taking separate vacations or taking cooking lessons at the cordon bleu?   Ok enuf of the rant, lets move on ( for now!!)

      Men who bathe in cologne should be banned from going out in public or at least standing in proximity of me. Hit the BritInvasion concert at MMM last night only to have my senses accosted by the hideous smell of cheap cologne.  A wift I can easily handle but this was the overpowering stench of OMG! Maybe the boy was wearing something very upscale but when it hit me it was a with an unparalleled force, a force that almost knocked me senseless. My eyes began to water and the coughing began, and it did not just affect me. The mosquitos and other living creatures came upon this barricade and fell quickly to the ground, gasping for breath, holding on to dear life only to release when stepped on by the hordes gathered to watch the awesome musical styles of Jay Sean and Juggy D ( more about that later ).  This boy needs to learn the art of the  mist-and-walk ~ when purchasing a cologne or perfume please understand that you need only a few strategically placed drops on your body. Please do not dump the entire contents over your head and shake it off ala bad swimming pool scenes in nearly all action movies. It is not attractive, it is actually quite repulsive.   Then the boy had the nerve to cut me off.    MANNERS  !! I realize mommy dearest did not teach you the art of personal hygiene but she must have instilled in you a wee bit of manners. If you see two people having a conversation, and there happens to a whack load of room around them, then please go around them-dont shove your skinny arse through them because, if the person is anything like me, you will get an earful. And if you must shove your way through them, please don't do it as a crowd, one of you is enough - more of you - now that's just pushing it.    Enough of the manners lesson...now for the fun stuff.        Went to MMM last night with a few friends, and extended friends (ju know friends of friends, people you can only stand in a group setting because you don't have to give them too much face time), and I can honestly say that once the opening act was over the Rishi Rich project did a bloody amazing job. Technical glitches aside the night was a good one. You cant beat a free concert at the harbourfront with one of THE hottest acts out of the UK. If you want more details, sorry mates you just had to be there to see it.      My questions are, however,  why is it that Canadian desi guys (1) don't look that good (2) have about as much talent as astroturf and (3) refer to #1.  And for the Brits out there - why do brit guys stop growing at 5ft8?        Hmmm...now if we could only combine the two ensuring that this 6 ft guy has talent, a british accent (pref cockney - the queen's English is so boring), potential, and is not gay, we could easily clone him and sell him on the 'brown' market (read Gerrard street) for a handsome sum...think of the potential.   hm.

       Call me a cynic, call me insane, call me whatever you want, but "soul mates" do not exist. This idea that one person was made for you and that it is your destiny/kismet to be with this one person for the rest of your life is completely irrational. Can you imagine waking up to the same person day in and day out for the next fourty to fifty years? Getting portly and pudgy together, being stuck in a single solitary relationship forever...am I only the one who is afraid of that? Am I the only one who fears the redundancy of it all? I guess not seeing every year the divorce rate keeps creeping up in this country, and divorce in the brown community is not so taboo anymore.   So I will stick to my belief that marriage is for fools who want to settle (ok ask me again how I feel in about three years maybe I'll have a different story). For now I am adamant on my claim that Hallmark invented "soul mates", come on look at the definition of soulmate -   Main Entry: soul mate Function: noun: a person temperamentally suited to another   - when you type in soulmate you get over a million sites dedicated to something immaterial. And if its so important why are there more sites dedicated to nametags than to something that people argue over...soul mates suck!!  Ok this cynic needs to get some work done, and avoid the calls of crazee GMNC members who think I'm up to no good...

      Ok two blind dates and a bunch of insane phone and email conversations later I declare I am not cut out for the dating scene. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, or uhm maybe I'm just attracting the freaks!   Freak example #1  - first contact email from a  'meet and greet'  ( read dating ) site - and all the boy talks about is the fact that he's a virgin but likes to give oral, and is looking for women ( yep he wrote women ) who would appreciate receiving. Uhm hello?? Isn't that like at least a third or fourth date kinda conversation, not a blind random email. I am not a prude but sorry to say I'm not that liberal either - that was over a week ago and I'm still in slight shock that some retard thinks that's appropriate...Ok maybe for the intimate encounters section of LavaLife that would be fine, but not some desi site....ew! ok stopping there.   Freak example #2  - the man with no plan - I've heard of letting destiny pick your path, I've heard of waiting for things to happen, but having absolutely zero clue what you want out of life and no idea of where you're going at any time...going with the flow is one thing, waiting for the flow to pick you up is another. You dont have to have a cause, but a teeny itty bitty bit of ambition would be nice.   Freak example #3  - Guys who start a conversation with " I don't normally date brown girls, but I'm making an exception with you"  is an idiot. How am I supposed to respond to that... uhm thanks, I appreciate that !?   NEXT!!!!!         Freak example #4  - this is an old one, but still a goldie..the big man who like to heli-ski, can I tell you how hard it was for me not to giggle...I'm a very visual person and the only image that went through my mind at that time was the graphical image of two very strong helicopters teetering up a snowy mountain, struggling to take this sasquatch of a man up to the top of the mountain. Yep I excused myself to go to the bathroom and laugh a wee bit.    Disclaimer: I am fully aware that occasionally some of the guys will go home and consider me the freak, and they have my permission to write me up on their blogs too, but I am also fully aware that majority of brown men wouldn't know the difference between a blog and a blhanik - so I have no worries!   Hell you can share your freak stories here if you want...
