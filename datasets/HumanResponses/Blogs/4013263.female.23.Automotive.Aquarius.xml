      Ya know, my boyfriend always tells me how disappointed he is in me for not doing whatever he says at the time. Its mainly going out and drinking for the most part. He is always disappointed that I get tired at 2 am and that I dont stay up with him as late as I do my other friends which is 4 am because I cant get them to leave before then.  He tells me every week how disappointing I am and how predictable I am because I  get tired at the same time, I work a regular work week and do the same things after I get home. He lets me know he doesnt want me.  He doesnt even know he doesn't want me yet. I feel like I am only around until something better comes along. I am the first girl that has never cheated on him and he is disappointed in me all the time.  I am one of the few girls that has not broken up with him and it is almost like he cant break up with me. Sometimes I think he is only with me for the same reason any other person would be and when something better comes along he will be gone.  I cannot give him what he wants because he wants me to be someone else that I am not. He is so busy focusing on what he thinks is wrong with me personally.  I dont see  him saying anything good about me anymore.  I cannot change anymore than I already have. I have done so many changes that were necessary.

      Yesterday I went to the Internal Medicine doctor that I have. I have a total of 5 doctors and I am losing 4 out of the 5 when my new insurance switches over. I am bummed about it, but i found out something interesting yesterday at my visit.  All those specialists I have been going to, I could of went to the internal medicine doctor all along. No more psychiatry, dermatology, gastrology, gynocology, and the internal medicine doctor. I am rejoycing. Insurance companies are willing to pay for an internal medicine doctor way over anything else. I am so excited that I will not have millions of appointments all the time anymore. In the last 2 years, I have switched insurance companies 3 times.  It has been a rough ride when it comes to deductables and copays. Hopefully, this new insurance I will be on for awhile so I won't have to deal with this BS anymore.  My new deductable is only 250. The old one is 1,000.  Big difference!

      Lately I have become obsessed with a particular musician.&nbsp; I don't really know why. It's not like he's cute or I would want anything to do with him sexually. Its more like a mind pick. He is so strange that I cannot help but to read his words and listen to his music. I look at his art and obsess over the meaning. I obsess over his traumas that have made him who he is. He is so strange that I just want to understand or be able to see through his eyes at things.&nbsp; I wonder why people who they are. I usually attach myself to people who are considered different. This singer is called Marilyn Manson.&nbsp; He's so strange that even his girlfriend(fiance) is a fetish film maker.&nbsp; I don't think shes a porno star, but pretty close. She's even eccentric.&nbsp; I have been reading his book trying to get a better idea, but it only leaves me asking more questions.&nbsp; Kinda like, theres got to be more to it than that.&nbsp; He is such an outcast that he has gathered all the outcasts and made them the majority while everyone else has turned into an outcast.&nbsp; He is one of the most apatheic people I have ever heard of.&nbsp; He writes all this hatred yet he tries to come off as if he doesn't care.&nbsp; I don't get it.&nbsp; Its like an unsolved riddle. Unfortunately, I will never solve this one because he is a human being.&nbsp; Its not like I can actually talk to him and go,"what's going on up in that head of yours to make you so unique?"&nbsp; And even if I could, its not like he can answer a question like that. Who can! I know I cannot about myself.&nbsp; Well I guess I will continue to wrap myself up in his mystery/misery trying to guess what is going on and what is the route cause and why am I so drawn to a tortured soul? I guess one thing about reading that book is it has made him more human. I have stopped having nightmares about him and dreamed more that I was him and can feel what he is feeling emotionally. I play out the scenes in his book in my dreams. I guess that is my own fault since I read it every night before I go to sleep.  In any case, from one person to another, he's pretty different. I respect that.

      The most popular religion in America is Christianity.&nbsp; My dad's father was&nbsp;a Baptist Preacher. My dad has always been a little hypocritical to religion. My sister is a bible thumping fanatic. People get so caught up in something to believe in, that no one really stops and thinks about what&nbsp; it can sounds like.&nbsp; To me, the bible,&nbsp; is a bunch of fables that teach moral value.&nbsp; Those people might have existed at some time, but the stories are more like tall tales of what really happened.&nbsp; People don't see the bible as a teaching tool. They see it as a form of reality and a desperate grasp to understand why they are on this earth.&nbsp;  Now, you may get pissed of at my viewpoint. I am not writing on here to piss people off. I just want to talk about things.  To me, my religion is more practical.&nbsp; My God is nature, science and mathmatics.&nbsp; We have no purpose here on earth.&nbsp; We are random acts of chemicals. We are powered by a soul that is energy (electricity). When the energy dissapates, we die and return to our God aka nature, science and mathmatics.&nbsp; We are put into this earth and we are gone. There is no heaven or hell. Just a transfer of energy into a never ending cycle. That cycle will only be broken if one of the energies&nbsp;or chemicals&nbsp;dissapates (sun, gravity, earth, oxygen).&nbsp;  Who each person is, is our nature. Chemicals and matter make up our individual personalities. Personalities and moods can be modified with outside chemicals whether they be illegal drugs or prescribed drugs.&nbsp; I am an example of this. My personality is modified with prescription drugs to make life seem more livable.&nbsp; If our personality is part of our soul, then we shouldn't have any capabilities of modifying who we are with chemicals.&nbsp;  Ghosts to me are natural phenomena when energy is displaced.&nbsp; It might be from a person that was on this earth, but that ghost does not inhabit the personality of the energy's past. Ghosts may be around us all the time. It might be something we electively see from time to time, if at all. When we see these ghosts, we might make them into an image we will understand such as a person we know whom has died.&nbsp; People instinctually force things into categories so they can bear to process the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also true that this very thought of ghosts debases the whole heaven and hell theory of Christianity.&nbsp; We can only have one and not the other. What is the answer?&nbsp; Who is right?&nbsp; When you try to make Christianity black and white, you can't. When you take my theory, it seems more plausable and easily transfers over into black and white. You can call my religion Panthiesm if you need the label.

      To everyone out there that discriminates, disrespects, and disbelieves mental illness should take the time to understand it first, then make a judgement call.&nbsp; There are a lot of people out in this world that take those mental illness labels and try to fit them into one tightly sealed "container" filled with the same thing over and over again. People fail to realize those terms are blanketing terms that are very general and non specific to most of the characteristics of the illness. Because of the stigma of mental illness, most Americans after being diagnosed with one, tend to lie about it in the future because they are afraid.&nbsp; They are afraid of losing their jobs, friends, and family. They are afraid that they will be wrongly judged and called psycho or crazy behind their backs.&nbsp; They are afraid that no one will listen to them anymore or think what they say is valid or real. Some people think that mental illness is a joke and a trendy epidemic in America.&nbsp; Some people think that people with mental illness are better off dead.&nbsp; Do you know what I say to these people? FUCK YOU! I was diagnosed initially when i was 16 years old with clinical depression.&nbsp; When I hit 18, i was diagnosed with clinical depression and social anxiety.&nbsp; When I was 20 years old, I was diagnosed bipolar type two and general anxiety. The last diagnosis still stands to this day.&nbsp; A lot of people in this world will look right at me and start trashing someone with a mental illness of a similar label as mine. These people do not know I have those labels as well. I let these people talk, but it makes me steam because of the ignorance of what they are saying.&nbsp; Most people think that mental illness makes you crazy or disabled.&nbsp; My illness sometimes gives me creativity, vision, and the ability to see differently than others.&nbsp; It has made me who I am.&nbsp; Right now, I take medication. I only take it because&nbsp; if I dont, then I stop sleeping very well.&nbsp; I also take medication to make me less filled with stress and tension from&nbsp; being scared.&nbsp; The nature of my disorders are not extreme. They are so mild in nature. I have never been hospitalized or drugged up because I was going to hurt myself.&nbsp; The way a movie portrays mental illness does not help the stigma.&nbsp; You have out there "Me, Myself, and Irene", "Girl Interrupted", "Secret Window", "A Clockwork Orange", "A Beautiful Mind", and countless others.&nbsp; They do not shed the light on the reality of what it is, but the extreme nature of what a person can go through if they have it. The majority of this world does not have it extremely bad. And most of those people are never treated.  I found this poem that I relate to. It really touched me and pointed out something about how society is concerning mental illness.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is as follows.    To Be a Mental Patientby Rae Unzicker (1948-2001)   To be a mental patient is to be stigmatized, ostracized, socialized, patronized, psychiatrized.   To be a mental patient is to have everyone controlling your life but you. You're watched by your shrink, your social worker, your friends, your family.&nbsp; And then you're diagnosed as paranoid.  To be a mental patient is to live with the constant threat and possibility of being locked up at any time, for almost any reason.   To be a mental patient is to live on $82 a month in food stamps, which won't let you buy Kleenex to dry your tears.&nbsp; And to watch your shrink come back to his office from lunch, driving a Mercedes Benz.   To be a mental patient is to take drugs that dull your mind, deaden your senses, make you jitter and drool and then you take more drugs to lessen the "side effects."   To be a mental patient is to apply for jobs and lie about the last few months or years, because you've been in the hospital, and then you don't get the job anyway because you're a mental patient.&nbsp;  &nbsp;To be a mental patient is not to matter.   To be a mental patient is never to be taken seriously.   To be a mental patient is to be a resident of a ghetto, surrounded by other mental patients who are as scared and hungry and bored and broke as you are.   To be a mental patient is to watch TV and see how violent and dangerous and dumb and incompetent and crazy you are.   To be a mental patient is to be a statistic.   To be a mental patient is to wear a label, and that label never goes away, a label that says little about what you are and even less about who you are.   To be a mental patient is to never to say what you mean, but to sound like you mean what you say.   To be a mental patient is to tell your psychiatrist he's helping you, even if he is not.   To be a mental patient is to act glad when you're sad and calm when you're mad, and to always be "appropriate."   To be a mental patient is to participate in stupid groups that call themselves therapy.&nbsp; Music isn't music, its therapy; volleyball isn't sport, it's therapy; sewing is therapy; washing dishes is therapy.&nbsp; Even the air you breathe is therapy and that's called "the milieu."   To be a mental patient is not to die, even if you want to -- and not cry, and not hurt, and not be scared, and not be angry, and not be vulnerable, and not to laugh too loud -- because, if you do, you only prove that you are a mental patient even if you are not.  And so you become a no-thing, in a no-world, and you are not.  Rae Unzicker © 1984

      Ok, I have this awesome computer with a DVD burner +-. It is absolutely the most complex piece of machinery I have ever owned.&nbsp; You can't just copy DVDS. You have to decript them, then you can burn them with Nero. Problem being is you have to have all the correct settings in order for this to work. Also, If your movie needs subtitles, you can just forget about zipping something up to burn.&nbsp; It is a long and complicated process. My friend Jon was over last night working on it for 4 hours.&nbsp; Finally I was like, GO HOME! I am tired!&nbsp; I feel really sleepy today as a result.&nbsp; We didn't even figure out how to burn the subtitles either.&nbsp; I just wanted to sleep for the night. Anyone know how to burn those DVD subtitles? I wish there was an all in one program to do this.&nbsp;

      I met Brian in January 2003. We started dating February 4, 2003.&nbsp; He is the longest boyfriend I have had that was not over a distance for some time. We started living together in October 2003.&nbsp; I love him very much. He is my friend, lover, and future husband (Hopefully).&nbsp; I do not want to have children and he does not pressure me to have them.&nbsp; We have our disagreements about something, but they have always seemed to work out. The only thing that hinders our relationship is the fact his parents hate me from the get go. They hate everyone. Brian is really hard up for their approval (which he will never get from anything he does) from them. We fight about his parents more than anything. He still has not told them we live together. He has not spoken to them in almost 7 months.&nbsp; It is a really long time not to speak to your family.&nbsp; I talk to my family about once a week.&nbsp; I think the fact that I wrote them a letter telling his parents how I feel and what they are doing really made Brian mad. Brian cannot stand up for himself&nbsp; or anyone to them. So I stood up for myself. I don't think I did anything wrong except putting things in writing instead of only calling them. Spoken words fade away.&nbsp; Written words people can dwell on their misery. I spoke the truth from my viewpoint.&nbsp; I tried straightening up what they thought about me, but they only made me cry and pushed me away. They are the most miserable people I have ever met in my entire life.&nbsp; Brian tends to get sucked into their misery and believes sometimes it is his fault.  Brian has a hard time with people.&nbsp; He always wants other people's approval for everything.&nbsp; He struggles with this on a daily basis. He suffocates what he really thinks so people will like him.&nbsp; There is a line you draw when it comes to people's approval.&nbsp; I think Brian is willing to cross the line sometimes.&nbsp; He becomes so concerned about what people think of me, that it is irritating. I don't care too much what people think. I have good and bad days and if someone catches me on a bad day, or if I do not like them, I do not hide my feelings.&nbsp; Brian has a hard time with this. He would rather me suck them all in and squash them as he does with his.&nbsp; I think Brian has a lot of growing up to do and a lot of hardening up as well. Brian has never had a job where his life depended on the money. He always had something to prevent that situation. He doesn't understand when I am tired because he can sleep however much he needs. He cannot understand me wanting to sit around because I am never home. He is always at home. He cannot understand that I am around people all the time and need my space. I think all this will change once he finally is completely on his own and working full time to pay off his debts from being in school.  Don't get me wrong, Brian is a wonderful person, but every wonderful person has their flaws.

      My new job is great.&nbsp; I stay busy most of the time. The only time I am not busy is on Fridays where no one is here. I have excellent benefits and excellent pay. I enjoy the work I do and I enjoy it when it is complete.&nbsp; I do not mind coming into work every day.&nbsp; I sit right behind my friend Margaret. She is the one that helped me get this position.&nbsp; I have been here for almost a month now. Things couldn't be better.  One thing about this job is I feel it has separated me from my friend Deborah, from my old job. All I can really say is my life is great now, and hers isn't. Her misery does not rub off on me anymore.&nbsp; I think it takes away from some of the common ground we had together. It is tough not to feel like I am bragging about my job when she is around.&nbsp; I do not have any major gripes like I used to with the old position. Misery loves company, and now I am not good company to her.&nbsp; I think she is one of those people that is addicted to misery.&nbsp;  My job is kinda interesting. It can be called a more complex version of Data entry and customer service.&nbsp; I administer a program along with a process that people use to publish new projects.&nbsp; Eventually I will be involved in process improvement.  VW does tuition reimbursement. I am going to go back to school in the Winter for my Masters of Science in Business Information Technology.&nbsp; Hopefully that will put me in line for management positions at VW.  This company is the kind of company I could work for, forever. One condition is that I get better positions as the years pass. Right now VW&nbsp; is ranked 88th best IT place to work in the country voted by ComputerWorld Magazine.  One of the cool benefits is I get is a discount on a vehicle. I am going to lease, and when you lease, they pay for your car insurance.&nbsp; Right now my car is a dump and I cannot wait to get my convertible VW Beetle.&nbsp; I currently have a Beetle, but I have had it for 5 years and it is turning into a pile of junk.  I feel that VW takes care of their employees very well. I feel that they are fair, just employers and I don't think they would allow the things that happend at my old company to occur here. I recommend this place. Its essentially the best place I have worked in my entire life.

       I have four cats because.... I am insane?&nbsp; no.... Because I wanted them? partially.&nbsp; Ok here is the story.&nbsp; I have 4 cats because of one cat and a boyfriend who don't get along.&nbsp; Somehow along the way, my precious Winter became terrified of my boyfriend, Brian, after we moved in together.&nbsp; He started shitting in places he wasn't suppose to as well as peeing. It got in his fur, in my closet etc. It made my life hell for 3 months. I had to lock Winter up in a cage.&nbsp; Me and Brian moved into a 2 bedroom apartment in February. Winter got his own room. Winter was still terrified and doing all those bad things even though he could hear Brian but couldn't see him.&nbsp; So, I thought that getting another cat would help.&nbsp; Well, I couldn't find a place who would not call my Landlord about having another cat. So I went to the vet and they were selling 2 cats for the price of one. They were littermates and just under a year old.&nbsp; I took them because I wanted something and if this is all I could get, I would take it.&nbsp;    Winter got immediately better.&nbsp; Brian's attitude towards cats improved by 100%.&nbsp; Then a few months later, I got an email from a friend saying he knew someone who wanted to get rid of their black persian.&nbsp; I couldn't resist since a black persian was my dream cat.&nbsp; Now I have Winter, Midnight, Jasmine and Jayma.&nbsp; My least favorite is Jayma because she beats up the cats to the point where she is vicious. She breaks things and shreds on things. She begs for food all the time.&nbsp; She is annoying. I wouldn't mind getting rid of her.&nbsp; The two kittens are compulsive over eaters.&nbsp; They eat so much that I had to have set feeding times for them. When they don't have food to eat, they like to eat things that are not food and they chew on wires.&nbsp; It is annoying. They are extremely obese. My two persians, Winter and Midnight, are so precious. They play together and have fun. They are so beautiful that it takes my breath away. I really love those two cats alot.&nbsp; I would be torn up if anything ever happend to them.    So that is the story of why I have 4 cats instead of just two.&nbsp;

      This is the first use of my new Blog. I hope it is as entertaining as it is thought provoking as I want it to be.&nbsp; I guess I can give a little background information about myself. My name is Breanne. I am 23 years old. I live with my boyfriend, 4 cats, and 1&nbsp;scared beta fish. I just started a month ago at my current job. I work in the Information Technology field. I waited long and hard for a position in IT.    I graduated from&nbsp;college in November of 2002 with a BA. in Computer Information Systems.&nbsp; I tried my hardest from August 2002 to December 2002 to get any permenant job.&nbsp; I had to give up and go to temping. From there is where I worked at several places including the place I am a permanent employee now. I was at VW as a temp then had to leave because they wouldn't hire me perm. I went off to Sho-Link.&nbsp; Who would of thought it would go from bad to much much worse. I never knew a "Dilbert" office or an "Office Space" office really would exist.&nbsp;  There I encountered all the things that made a bad business. There was nepotism, favortism, shovanism, sexual harrassment, drug usage, and just plain stupid people.  My first day, I met everyone. I went in there thinking everything will be good and fine.&nbsp; My first day wanted to send me running. They smoked in the office, causing me to get migranes all week. They did take me out to lunch the first two days but the rest of the week I ate alone and from that point on I ate alone because they didn't want me in their clique (3 people were really clique). This girl, Deborah, was the administrative assistant.&nbsp; She seemed loud, angry, and repressed. After me and her were left there at the end of the day while all the higher up people got to leave before 8 hrs was up, she would sit with me and bitch about how horrible the company was. She told me past stories of things that absolutely struck fear into my heart.&nbsp; I would often go home&nbsp; and cry.&nbsp; Her misery spread into my misery.&nbsp; My misery over the next 10 months turned into my own misery, a reality that I couldn't bear.  Jenny, my supervisor, was the dumb blonde that always laughed at what you said yet when you complained, she would brush you off.&nbsp; She talked incessantly about herself and would completely tune out others while she went on and on.&nbsp; All you really had to do was knod and say yes every once in awhile.&nbsp; I started avoiding her after 3 months.&nbsp; Every once in awhile she would corner me in my office and make me talk about something about herself that I didn't give a rats ass about.&nbsp; She didn't give a rats ass about me, so I could hardly care for her.&nbsp;  While I was there I got really sick.&nbsp; The pressures of having to be at the office 40 hrs a week with no leeway was too much. I had a rough February with moving into a new apartment. They weren't particularly fond of anyone taking off work and would talk trash about the person if they were gone.&nbsp; It made me reluctant to be gone. It made me want to be around so they wouldn't gang up on me behind my back.&nbsp; I also attempted to ask if I could leave 30 minutes early for two months so I could take a class, and they said no. I couldn't believe&nbsp;Jenny.&nbsp; Her excuse is she has an office to run, but she is never there.&nbsp; Also, 30 minutes isn't asking for much.&nbsp; At that point, I loathed her.&nbsp; I was determined to leave Sho-Link at this point.  At Sho-Link, I was a CS Rep. There was a girl,&nbsp;Shannon,&nbsp;that had my position before me that worked at one of the other companies we did business with. Ironically enough, not only did they attempt to fire this girl in the past, but recommended her to the other company, Derse.&nbsp; This girl hated me instantly because I had her old position. She tried to make my life hell at that company. And it worked. She got exactly the reaction from Jenny and the president, Alan that she wanted.&nbsp; She constantly was trying to get me in trouble. It first started with her stating I did an order wrong that cost them tons of money. I ended up proving her wrong. Another mistake is one time she called 15 til 5pm and I said, Oh I turned off my computer. Let me turn it back on.&nbsp; That next day I got "disiplined" by my supervisor, Jenny.&nbsp; I couldn't believe they were making this such a big deal. The things that girl got away with when she worked here were far greater than turning off a computer a little early.&nbsp; She would stretch the truth about me always. She told them I turned off my computer an hour early. It was quite ridiculous. She couldn't prove anything, but I could because Deborah was there.  Another instance with this girl, Shannon was she came to an office baby shower uninvited.&nbsp; Everyone felt really uncomfortable. When she left the room, I said she makes me feel uncomfortable to the VP, Scott.&nbsp; He took this comment, told the president, Alan, and the whole office got in trouble for it.&nbsp; I thought it was insane that everyone got in trouble over that. I had a right to say how I felt in a non-insulting manner.&nbsp; After all the things she had done to me, I had a right to feel SOMETHING.&nbsp;  Sho-Link has a end of the year party every year(its really a Christmas Party). Me and my boyfriend went. My boyfriend that night got totally tanked. While he was dancing with me, he slammed his head into mine, cutting open his skin above his eye.&nbsp; We had to rush him to the emergency room. The VP, Scott, took us there. My boyfriend was puking everywhere and crying. I ended up taking him back to the hotel and I left him for a few minutes. I went up to the Presidents room where they were having a party.&nbsp; Alan attempted to take a cleevage shot of my breasts.&nbsp; I left the room.&nbsp; I was already humiliated enough.&nbsp; I ended up staying up all night cleaning up Brian's vomit.&nbsp; I wanted to never see those people again.&nbsp; When I went to work that next week, they laughed and teased me about it. They said something happens to someone every year. My opinion of the majority of these people was not a good one.&nbsp; I didn't feel any better being compared to someone else at that company.  While I was there, I slowly became good friends with Deborah and Carrie.&nbsp; Deb more than Carrie though.&nbsp; Deborah was really fun to be around.&nbsp; She was smart, inteligent, deligent, and on her way to becoming successful.&nbsp; I clung to her for the only intelligent conversation and common interests we had outside of work.&nbsp; Carrie and I shared an office and became friends in a way that made me learn a lot from her.&nbsp; She made me laugh and was fun to be around.&nbsp; She would talk about anything.  In&nbsp;March of 2004, I received a call from my old friend Margaret at VW. She said they were going to have an open position in her area and I could do that job. She asked if I was interested. I said yes. I wanted out. I never thought it was going to happen. Two months trickled by without a word from anyone. Finally, while searching Monster.com, I saw my job on there!&nbsp; I was outraged, upset, disturbed, and sad.&nbsp; I was passed up again!&nbsp; So, I applied again anyway.&nbsp; A few more weeks goes by and I get called in for an interview.&nbsp; I was nearly jumping out of my skin for weeks. I was so excited. I went to the interview and it was awesome. I did better at that interview than any other one in the past. I was not even nervous.&nbsp; I thought for sure I had this one.&nbsp; At the end of the week, I received a call offering me the job. I was stoked!&nbsp; I put in my two weeks notice the following Monday and here I am.&nbsp; I work at VW&nbsp; in the field of MY CHOICE.

      I have come to realize how most of me, is inside my head. I think more internally and hardly ever vocalize what I am thinking. I think what if, if then, type scenarios, act them out in my head and come to a conclusion to what will happen. I realized this because me and Brian were at his friends house and everyone was talking.  I kept dazing off and people wandered what I was thinking.  Most of the time I do not realize I am psycho analyzing a situation until I really stopped to think about it(once again).  It helped me realize who I am more.  I realize now why I am not very articulate.  I am so used to explaining ideas in my head, that I have no practice telling someone else these things, because I miss telling all the links that brought me to the conclusion. I definitely need to work on this attribute because I need to be better at articulating my thoughts at work.  I need to fine tune my words of persuasion and speaking in complete thought processes.  I internalize so much, that I never really realized this part of me. I just expect people to fill in the gaps naturally.  What is so weird is, when I go into myself, it is like the outside of me shuts off and I look blank or angry or sad, when really, I am just somewhere else completely.

      I do not know what is with me lately, but everything smells horrible.  I wonder if this is normal. People's body odor, breath, etc are driving me crazy. The smell of skin even. Kinda weird. I also think I imagine some smells.  For example, sometimes when I have gone down on a guy, I think i smell urine or like old cum on them.  It kinda grosses me out.  And I feel like my sensitivity to smell right now is turning me into an ice queen.  Ever notice  how awful sex smells? Ugh, I cannot stand the way it smells. Also, the room that I sleep in smells bad. Me and my boyfriend open a window and it does not help. It has permeated the room. The sheets even smell bad from it along with my boyfriend's clothes that are in there.  It seems like smells are so intense lately. Maybe it is hormonal. Maybe it is because I have all these smelly litter boxes everywhere, so I am constantly bombarded with a horrible smell. Or the fact that my boyfriend doesn't take out the trash enough, so the trash starts smelling.  Maybe it is the fact that my boyfriend also likes to dump food down a drain, and it starts smelling like rot.  Constant exposure to horrible things has probably gotten me oversensitive. You would think I wouldn't smell it after awhile. One time my friend came over and his feet smelled. I felt like it was so strong, I made him bathe his feet.  I couldn't believe I did that. How rude can I get??  LOL.

      This weekend was pretty good. Me and Brian had random fights as always. And as always he likes to categorize and assume I will do things because I have done things that way in the past.  It is really frustrating to always be put into the negative that way. His assumptions are negative always.  He never says a good assumption.  He can pretty much give me attitude about everything then reflect how I did something wrong in his eyes, drawing away the critical point of it all. For example: Korn has been calling you way too much dont you think Brian? Reply: Well I only answered because YOU were in your room and I didnt have anything better to do since you were in your room. I was bored.  (AKA my fault).  This stuff gets to me. It irritates me.  At the time I brought this up, I was looking to buy a vacation for the two of us and I just got soured by the reception Brian gave me when I made a comment on how much Korn calls.  It was such a turn off.  But otherwise I had fun. I enjoyed the Symphony (of what little we got to hear since it started raining) and I enjoyed paddle boating (despite Brian's attempts to fill the evening with commentary because he felt uncomfortable in our silence).  People are so strange. We headed over to Christina's afterwards yesterday and when we are about to leave she says she wants us to come over next Saturday.  She gets interrupted, and i say well anyway what were you saying Christina?  She goes oh so you wont come over unless you hear what is going on? I say no, I just wanted you to finish what you had to say.  I hate all these verbal battles. It is such a turnoff.

      Today, me and Brian went and got photo's taken. It was really fun. The photographer accused me of practicing.  I honestly just like taking photos. Brian had fun too it seemed.  It was just so cool. Now I have photos to give to my parents and some to put on my desk.  Tonight we are going to the chicago symphony orchestra at Ravina.  We are going to have a picnic and stuff. It will be very romantic. We are celebrating our year and a half together.  It doesn't seem like it could possibly be this long that we been together. We go through alot. We deal with each other alot through many issues.  We are still together though. It amazes me too.  We never have broken up once in all the time we have been together. I guess things work out if it is right.
