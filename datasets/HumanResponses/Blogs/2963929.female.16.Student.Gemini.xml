       I feel fine and I feel good   I'm feeling like nobody should   When ever I get this way   I just don't know what to say   Why can't we be ourselves   Like we were yesterday   I'm not sure what this could mean   I don't think you're what you seem   I do admit to myself   That if I hurt someone else   Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

       Everytime I think of you   I feel shot right through with a bow of gloom   It's no problem of mine    But it's a problem I find   Living a life that I can't leave behind   There's no sense in telling me   The wisdom of a fool won't set you free   But that's the way that it goes   And it's what nobody knows   While every day my confusion grows

       It must have been love   But it's over now   It must have been good   But I lost it somehow   It must have been love   But it's over now   From the moment we touched   To the time that ran out  It must have been love   But it's over now   It was something I wanted   Now I'm living without   It must have been love   But it's over now   It's where the water flows   It's where the wind blows   [Roxette][It must have been love]

        Tis is my second blog after I've woken up from a nightmare. I've learnt the lesson about love in the hard way, however I've got only myself to blame.         Never try to forget someone by making yourself drunk, it makes you more miserable (unless you are drinking those alcoholic drinks with at least 60% of alcohol, which you will just go unconsious immediately). I've wasted alot of money to buy those 5% alcoholic drinks which have no effect on me until the fifth to sixth bottle.          Never cut yourself with a pen knife and bleed to forget someone. Even if you bleed to death he or she won't come back to you. Mine doesn't leave any scars at all!!! If it does, it will remind you of that someone everytime you looked at the scars.        Don't bother to read my previous blog, it was already a history which i don't wish to remember any of it.

        Vindicated      I am selfish      I am wrong      I am right      I swear I'm right      Swear I knew it all along      [Vindicated][Dashboard Confessional]        Do you hope to solve everything and make them right? Are you free from blame?  Do you need to clear yourself from people's accusation or suspicion? Have you defend and justify yourself from wrong? Do you ever exact revenge for someone or even yourself?        Do everything without feeling guilty and regretful...you will be happier that way.        I have done everything to let a person feel the importance of him in my life. Although i knew the answer and the outcome all along, I still hope a miracle can happen.        And I am flawed      But I am cleaning up so well      I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself      [Vindicated][Dashboard Confessional]

        I guess everyone knows that there are 7 colours in a rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. But why does jealousy have to go with green?           From the day i learn the phrase " green with envy", I have been thinking why isn't it "red with envy" but "red with anger" so on and so forth. Can we really see a green colour on a person if the person is jealous? If this really happen, everyone on this earth will be green...i mean, definitely everyone or most of us is once jealous of something right? How about the green man on the traffic light? Does it mean that the green man is jealous of the red man above him because the red man can make people stop? Haha...maybe i should stop all my craps le.          Anyway, i hate the feeling of jealousy. It will only make me feel unhappy, unsure of myself, lack of confidence, sadness, revengeful and many many more.           Is it possible if jealousy is not one of the feelings we felt every now and then?

Before we went to the esplanade to watch the fireworks, we went to breadtalk buy bread there to eat in case we hungry. so poor thing, we ate bread for dinner lehZ...       The fireworks simply rocks!!! the best fireworks i've ever watched. those who missed it is a real pity. however i dunno y i dun feel tat happy after all...maybe beocs he wasn't there... i dun noe... many ppl actually asked mi to watch the fireworks with them and yet all i wanted is to watch with him.

In the end he never came...not even a phone call from him, just a cold cold message which says tat he can't make it. I mean wat was i thinking of...haha...we are just friends...realli...juz friends.....
