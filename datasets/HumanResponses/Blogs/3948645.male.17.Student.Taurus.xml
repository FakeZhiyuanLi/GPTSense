       I have been playing Final Fantasy XI for about three months now and its starting to get really fun. I am  Level 15 Warrior, Level 7 Red Mage, and  Level 5 Monk. For about the entire month of june I only played it maybe 2 times a week for only a couple hours, mainly cause I was bored with it and was playing other games. But recently I have been playing everyday and it keeps getting better. I went from lvl 12 warrior to lvl 15 warrior in about 3 hours while in a party, and believe that is really good. And today I got to lvl 5 monk in 2 hours. This game is definitely a good one. I just cant wait until lvl 18 for my warrior. Then I can go on a quest for a subjob. Meaning I could be a warrior/red mage, warrior/ monk, or whatever else i want to be. I highly recommend this game if you like RPG's (Role Playing Games.) And if you have a lot of time on your hands, because this game definitely takes time to play. So if you buy this game, let me know, I can buy a world pass for you, so you can play on the same server as me (unicorn.) Its a lot easier to play it, when you know others.

       Recently I was banned from my friends website, communityforums.net, for making a comment about illegal immigrants. It was totally blown out of proportion because it was on a thread about "what things bother you," and I put on there what bothered me. I wasnt aware that saying something about illegal imigrants was racism. This "thing" goes back to a day in English class when I wrote a paper about non-english speaking people getting jobs in America. I wrote something that I probably shouldn't of but did anyways to spark a conversation. I was unaware someone was going to get really mad at me, and call me a racist. I didnt mean but 1/100 of a percent of it and it still got me thrown into the doghouse. However, I said I was sorry to the person who I offended and I thought it was in the past and that everything was ok. But after I made the comment on the site I was banned and I think it was a harsh punishment for one infraction on the site. So if you ever see this,(and anyone else who sees, let the person(s) know about this), I am sorry for the comment, sorry about the paper I wrote, and I'm sorry for creating another account on the site when I shouldn't of. Sorry.

       Yeah, maybe you think I have no life, but I just beat Halo again! However, I beat playing on my PC this time, and I am currently working on beating it on Heroic on my XBOX. I tried legendary and thats just insanely hard to do, but so far I got to the 2nd lvl on that difficulty lvl. I got to the 3rd lvl on Heroic and seems rather easy. Anyways, if anybody else plays Halo on PC, I was wondering if you wanna set-up a multiplayer match online. I play better on XBOX but I am good on PC too. Let me know.

       Today I went to the doctor to find out whether or not I would need surgery on my leg, to have the rod removed that was inserted because of my injury. However, I dont need to have it out. YEAH NO SURGERY!!!! I can leave it in and I can play sports this year!!! The only things I have to worry about are metal scanners at the airport or lightning, cause now I'm a human lightning rod. So keep your distance if you hear thunder. j/k. YEAH!!!
