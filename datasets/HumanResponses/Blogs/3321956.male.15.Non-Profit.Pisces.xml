      haiz... yesterday i went to sentosa... wif sze tuan and madaline... qing wei and wan win... alex and yf... and kay boon, peng hou,gerald,fish,cheryl and finally... my main purpose for the trip... michelle... it was fun... and left lots of memories swmming in my mind... michelle took my attention the first time i saw her... yet fear for pain took me away from liking her... yet... on the night when i sang in lonelness and sadness in the ktv, i receieve news about her admiring me... without hesitation... i pick up my handphone and took immediate action...    i thought love was with me... yet... she said she don want me to like her because she like me... so i told myself... which is to shower her with all the love and concern i could give... i told myself... i wanna take care of her... i want to be the one to offer my shoulder when she crys... i wanna be the love she need... so i went on wif my plan to win her heart... not by mushy words... but by action to show her how much i could do for her... As days passes... my love for her grew deeper... i could even smell her aura... which others could not detect... Confidence so widen as i sent her home and walk wif her all the way to amk mo kio... yet all this doesnt matter... i told myself i needed her heart... this love could be the turn of my life... Worse still... when we were swimming along the coast of sentosa... Fear caught her and she hugged me for support... tat was the first time i experience such warth love... my plan to sentosa was meant to be romantic... i plan to stay wif her till night to see the beatiful colours of the musical fountain and confessing my love for her... yet she gotta follow cheryl home... so that left me wif no choice but to cancel everything prepared for her... so i followed them back to bishan... we played basketball for sometime before going for dinner... after that we went back to the court and played till the light were out... so we went to the park and sat down for a chat... both of us layed down on the grassy land and look at the stars{although there is no stars] that left me a very strong impression... so it was getting late...and i brought here home as i promised... the night was strange... yet i didnt bother... wat was important to me at that time was to sent her home... Gastric pain soon flawed but i didnt bother... soon we reached her block... and... she left... as i walked home... i ask myself... im i the right person for her? while on the way back... gastric pain was killing me... as i reach home... i layed on the bed bearing the pain and search everywhere for food... i told myself... for michelle safety... every pain i suffer is worth... life couldnt be better without this love...  the next day... i was awaken by michelle morning call... so i got and have my lunch and plan for my day... i told myself... that i should confess my love by tonight... and... i did it... yet... i was rejected...it ended up that i was not the one she love... and her chosen one was yet to come... i scurred at home in depression... and i told myself to forget this love... yet... i couldnt... now... im trapped in this painful love...
