      the trouble with love is... i can't find love... haha... nonono... i can find... but it is not working... haha... love can be fun.. enjoyable... passionable... but if can oso be... painful... boring... something that goes totally wrong... hiaz... i like this song... by kelly clarkson... the first american idol... soo cool rite? i have her here... right in my blog... haha... okok.. joking.. dun beat me...   why does someone pretend that she has admirers... pretend that she got molested and forced kissed by guys... pretend that she has a boyfriend... you dun have means dun have wat... why pretend... by pretending... your just making your self more cheap... i hate tt... someday... a guy will fall in love with you... jus be patient and wait... maybe it is not time yet... or maybe they know that you always pretend that guys like you... hiaz... i know your not say very pretty... not very smart... and have many flaws... but wats wrong with tt? i am even uglier... stupider... and i have more flaws than you... i am a bitch... a slut... so dun learn from me... jus study hard first... nobody will laugh at you for not having a bf... but they will laugh at you if you pretend that you have... get it? prove that you have self-worth... not some cheap ass that lets any guy take advantage of... ok?  having no love... makes a person desperate for love... they go around looking for a cute or nice guy... and they try to make him like her... but usually all she gets is rejection... which is really painful... but it does not mean that you will remain single for the rest of your life... jus be who you are.. that nice, sweet, girl-next-door... and guys will fall in love with you... no matter if you are pretty or not...   your bf does not have to come from acs or sji... they may jus come from some ulu panda sch... but... if you and him really love each other... there is no wrong in telling ppl..." my bf is from a ulu panda sch.." i dun see what is wrong... if they say that they are stupid or ugly or what the hell they have... jus tell them what you really feel and think abt him... and let them understand that love is blind... but your heart is not... tell them that you dun go for looks... tell them you dun go for sch or marks... you go for the character... which is the most important thing...   to be continued... when i feel like it... read the first blog i wrote today... today:"i'm too lost in love" and "the trouble with love is"

      The real me is a southern girl with her Levis on and an open heart Wish I could say the save the world, like I was super girl The real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated  I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like Do you know what it feels like? Cause with you I can let my hair down  I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you  With you Now that I'm with you  You speak and it's like a song And just like that all my walls come down It's like a private joke just meant for us to know I relate to you naturally Everybody else just fades away Sometimes it's hard to breathe Just knowing you found me Cuz I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like Do you know what it feels like? Cause with you I can let my hair down I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you With you  Come and take me Love you save me Like nobody else Now I can be myself With you  With you I can let my hair down I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now (Baby as I do now) Now that I'm with you

      I'm 15 for a moment Caught in between 10 and 20 And I'm just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are  I'm 22 for a moment She feels better than ever And we're on fire Making our way back from Mars  15 there's still time for you Time to buy and time to lose 15, there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live  I'm 33 for a moment Still the man, but you see I'm a they A kid on the way A family on my mind  I'm 45 for a moment The sea is high And I'm heading into a crisis Chasing the years of my life  15 there's still time for you Time to buy, Time to lose yourself Within a morning star    15 I'm all right with you 15, there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live  Half time goes by Suddenly you’re wise Another blink of an eye 67 is gone The sun is getting high We're moving on...  I'm 99 for a moment Dying for just another moment And I'm just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are  15 there's still time for you 22 I feel her too 33 you’re on your way Every day's a new day...  15 there's still time for you Time to buy and time to choose Hey 15, there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live

      whats love? whats love? whats love? is it a feeling for someone? is it just lust? is it really more powerful than anything else? well... i think it is all three... love is definitely a feeling for someone... and not only feelings.. but strong feelings for someone... an undescribeable feeling that surrounds you all day long... you can't sleep... you can't eat... you can't spent a moment without thinking or being with that someone... and when you see them... you have this sudden urge to hug or kiss that person... and doin that makes you feel like your the happiest person alive... thats the feeling of love... lust... ya.. lust makes up love... 40% about it... cuz when you love each other... you wanna hug and stuff like tt... lie in bed together... sleep... do everything together... it is also more powerful than anything else... cuz love can change someone... very much... from bad to good... and it is able to make the people find their way in life... love is a great thing... at least to me la... cuz love may not be good to ppl who suffered alot in it...  i just f***ed my sister... aren't i bad? i can't stand her... i just came home... tired... bored... then came online to type my blog... then she went to complained that i typed to loud... then we quarreled... i know she hates me saying the "f" word... so i purposely said it.. and she started crying... then she hit me... but i didn't hit her back... i tried to control already.. or else i would have jus taken something and threw at her... or i may even take a knife to stab her... i almost stab my youngest sister before... but my maid stopped me... i am really trying to control myself... i try to throw the things somewhere other then at the person... i try to relax.. and think that she is jus singing a song... lalala... i think it is helping... but i still have to f*** her... it is becoming a habit.. i better stop... hiaz... i must be mentally unstable... need to go see doctor liao...   i miss ya...  i miss all of you...  i miss all the happy days... i miss the days we got together...  to lie in bed and sleep, and rub each other's back... watch the sun rise, and snuggle together... watch horror movies, and scream our lungs out... kiss under the mistletoe, and ignore the brewing storm...  all those wonderful days... still remain in my memory... all those wonderful days...  seem jus like yesterday... can you remember?  can we go back???
