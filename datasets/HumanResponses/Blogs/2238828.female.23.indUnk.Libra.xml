       if i say my heart is sore / it sounds like a cheap metaphor / so i won't repeat it no more  - poem to a horse || shakira  it's not going to be this hard again, is it? it's everything and nothing, once more, yet another time, ad nauseam. everything in my life comes in one tiring endless loop, ups and downs swooping on me without warning, and i wish it wasn't like that. wish i didn't have to pay for my good days with bad days like this, when smoking a cigarette makes me want to singe myself.  it's not just a wrong kind of love, it's everything. last night my sister told me that she was going to run away.  i mean it,  she said, her words grating hard against her pillow as we spoke in soft voices in our dark room.  it's that or die of depression, and i don't want to die.    sometimes you get hope from the weirdest sources. tomorrow i'm just going to wake up again and in two days, maybe three, i'll be happy and i'll feel like i'm worth something again.   maybe i'm breaking up with him  for his own good , and maybe it's a good idea that i don't fall in love for a long time. the way i am, i'm afraid i'm just going to eat someone up, swallow them down and suck them so dry that even their bones won't remember what moisture was like. bones. everything is bones and dust, ashes and black holes, infertile and nonproductive. it doesn't help to have this doubting in me that says  you can't have children, you'd only hurt them,  and although i never thought of myself as a mother, there's a sort of ripping feeling inside, a hollowing out with a blunt object that comes from imagining a life without ever knowing what it's like to be pregnant, to carry a baby inside of me.  tomorrow i'll remember i'm still only twenty-one and i still have time, there's still so much time.  right now i feel as if i have nothing left, and no time left, and no heart to struggle for the last remnants of what could have been passion.

      i've been flipping through my old entries. my, what a depressive child i am. a couple of weeks ago, a business colleague of my parents came to KL, and we were taking him out everywhere. he was much too friendly, in the way overly eager businessmen often are, and in an effort to win me over, he spent most of his time psychoanalyzing me.    you don't smile much, do you?  he finally concluded, after three days of apparent failure.  i mean, i've never seen you smile voluntarily.     i smile,  i said.  i just don't feel like it,  is what i was thinking and didn't say. see, i've learned restraint. i'm not such a brat after all.  two hours after that, we went out to dinner and brought my sister with us, and he kept on staring in our direction.  you're different when you're with your sister,  he commented, totally non-apropos to whatever they were discussing at the moment.  very animated.   i came very close to saying  no shit, sherlock,  managed to hold it back, but didn't quite manage to restrain the weird look i gave him. i don't quite understand this strange obsession people have with smiling. a few weeks ago, E was playing around with a camera and was trying to coax me to smile so he could take a picture. i, on the other hand, was attempting to hide behind the television because the draperies were useless - they were semi-transparent.  smile,  he insisted.   i can't,  i retorted, giving up on hiding behind the television and trying to burrow beneath the bedcovers instead.  i feel like an idiot. what the hell am i smiling for?    think of something happy,  he said.  a comedy. your love life. chocolate.  no effect; i gave him my best glare from where i was shielded, behind the monitor of his laptop.  fine,  he conceded.  think of throwing me out the window from the ninth floor.  i cracked up at that one, and then subsequently cracked up again at the look on his face. apparently, it had never occurred to him that violent thoughts would make me happy.  okay,  he grumbled after snapping the picture,  it wasn't THAT funny.  i just howled.   my friends are weird.

      strange, the things i find inside my head, when i crawl inside on a weak day. a pair of gruesome handcuffs, delicately fashioned to carefully rip away at the tender flesh of your wrists when you try to free yourself from them. a litter of pictures, all of little girls who never smile and whose eyes are dark and angry and horribly sad. butterflies pinned to cardboard. a boy's bb gun. half-burnt papers and books, violated diaries. and i can never figure out how they got there.  i remember notblood, the coldness of steel against my hands, the way i squirmed against marble to get rid of the heat burning beneath my skin like fever. these are things that never happened, yet have residency in my memory. it's as terrifying as multiple personality disorder - the feeling that you are betraying yourself by shifting personalities, by creating memories and lives that you are not wholly aware of. i remember glass, and the sick slick slide of it, the way you would feel a slight stinging only to look down and realize that you were being drained, that blood was staining your bedroom carpet.  things that never happened, and yet i know them. my imagination is way too vivid, most days.

      just came home from watching  star wars 2  ... i hate to say i'm disappointed, because i waited TWO YEARS for this, but i am. kind of. yoda kicked ass for the first time. maybe i'm just hopelessly visual, but i needed to see that because all these years, he's been nothing but the annoying green wrinkly thing that talks backwards. today he became more - the annoying green wrinkly thing that talks backwards and KICKS ASS. oh yes.  i am sublimely disappointed in the anakin-padme relationship. first off: why do they always pick such horrible actors for the anakin character? do they not understand that this character will become DARTH VADER some day? they are NOT playing around with a minor character! in the last three episodes, amidala is just a vague memory in leia's head; obi-wan is a phantom; yoda is masquerading as the swamp thing; and everybody else is just history. it's anakin who develops, anakin who is the axis around which both stories revolve. without him, there is no saga. and yet they keep on casting these very very bad actors to play him. i'm almost afraid to see who they're going to cast as anakin in the next episode, if they're going to recast him again. i'm not even going to speculate, i'm so afraid.  secondly, this anakin will not become darth vader - not the way he's played, not the way he's written. darth vader had charisma, a cool insidious charm that wrapped around you and seduced you into the dark side. i can still remember him talking to luke: just the way he said his name, with command and an underlying certainty that his son would obey - this is a man who has incredible power, a genius that has taken matters into his own hands because he can no longer bear to see the way other people fumble around with things that take him seconds to master. he's our worst nightmare - the hyperintelligent, all-powerful man who has broken free from the social contract to establish his own code, simply because he can - and because he knows others will follow. this anakin - no one will follow him.   i'm disappointed in padme, as well - i thought she had more passion than to be swayed by sweet words. she gave in too soon, and she should not have fallen in love. i don't understand where it went. she was so kick-ass in ep 1 - i felt for her, a fourteen-year-old queen with her shoulders bowed under the weight of her world. in the opening scene, that compassion and sense of weighty responsibility was still there, in the repressed grief in her voice as she called out her dying handmaiden's name. she was pissed as hell at being sent back to naboo before she had been able to do her job ... then the queen sends her to her country home, and suddenly all she can think about is rolling in the grass with anakin. it doesn't make sense, especially when anakin is about as charming as a piece of driftwood. even anakin's love felt forced, as if it were there only because the story required it.   they shouldn't have been in love. they didn't need to be.   i never thought that luke and leia had been conceived in love, even when i watched the movies as a child; i always thought that even their conception had been a struggle for power, a challenge given and a challenge taken up. i saw padme being sucked in against her will into anakin's quiet, dark magnetism; i saw anakin withdrawn and sullen, frustrated with a system that was too slow and inadequate for his talent and skill.   instead i got a two-hour bodice ripper and a lot of comedy. which was nice, but not what i expected. i want my saga back, my sci-fi world based on the skewed principles of plato and a hefty dose of lucas!imagination. i want that wonderful thing that kept me obsessed in my childhood, that fed my fantasies for years. it's lost its magic, and that, my friends, is never fun.

      the nice thing about mood swings - i mean, if you really, really couldn't avoid them and had to live with them for some reason - is that no matter how low you sink, you know that if you just ride it out, you'll find a reason to hope again. what was that verse -  sorrow comes in the night, but joy comes in the morning.    and if i just hold on, if i can just wait out this period of depression, then i can return to feeling better in a while. if i don't weaken and touch that bottle of pills, or that broken shard of glass, then i'll be fine.   i'll be fine.

       falling in love is so hard on the knees ...  - falling in love ... || aerosmith   indeed. and on the elbows, and on the hands, and on the thighs and wrists, and on all the tight strings that bind your body together, and on the loose soft parts that hide tenderly behind your bones. it stings and burns and pulls on your opposite ends until you can feel the give and snap, feel the pieces of you coming apart along seams that you never thought you had.   there's a hollow ache in my stomach now, and that could be one of those seams.  you lost weight,  my mother said, pleased, when i came out of my room dressed in a tight shirt and a clingy skirt - the first time i've worn tight clothing in such a long time. i feel lighter, not quite so lumberingly weighted down as i used to feel, but not happier. i could weigh a hundred pounds and my shoulders would still feel bowed. my knees would still buckle.    it's okay to feel that way,  V told me once, as we looked out over the city glitter from the top of ayala hill. i just shook my head and tried not to cry, because no matter how close we are, somehow it still doesn't seem right to break down like that, over something as trivial as a soured love affair. technically it's all my fault anyway, for hanging on to something that i should have lopped off at the knees at the soonest possible time, but instead i hoarded it to cut myself with, like the shards of glass in my room when i was thirteen.   and i'm just so tired.   i don't want to wait anymore, and i don't want to look forward to this again. maybe i'll feel differently about all this a few years from now, or tomorrow, after i've had a good night's sleep - but for now, it hurts   and it hurts   and   it   hurts.

      today was the day that took me by the heels, turned me upside down, and shook me until my brains rattled in my head like misshapen marbles. right now i'm in a quiet hiatus from the bustle, allowing myself to take the lunch break we didn't have the time to take earlier. we did go out for lunch, but only to check out the hotel at which the philippine business delegation will be meeting their malaysian counterparts - so technically we were working then, too. it certainly felt like it - we walked all the way to the hotel and back, then went to a stationery store and bought various office supplies before FINALLY buying our food, which we had wrapped to go. we got back to work as soon as we closed the office door behind us, setting our lunch aside for later.  i have to attend classes on saturday and sunday, and i have to teach classes the whole day on sunday. a while ago my boss informed me that i just might have to be on standby at the mandarin oriental from sunday morning onwards, so right now i'm just looking at my options and wondering which one is going to give. at the moment, all them are unyielding and i have a funny feeling that  i'm  the one who's going to give.  i'm just going to be so glad when it's all over.

      a rooftop with stars above it, a sky so big and stars so indifferent that no matter what i do, i can't hurt it. i want something undentable, something that i can break my body against without breaking it as well - something constant versus this inconstancy. i hate this emptiness that rings inside my bones, that scrapes off the edges of my skin. and if i only knew how to fill it up, i would.

       At 5:56 PM yesterday, the nation was sent into shock when Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad announced his resignation from all UMNO and Barisan National Posts.  - "Jolt From PM", Sunday Star, 23 June 2002  i just saw the paper, and my heart turned over. apparently his resignation was unanimously rejected by the UMNO assembly, but there were a few hairy moments. no one saw it coming; as soon as he announced it, the deputy prime minister ran to the microphone and begged him to reconsider. the heads of the women and youth wings rushed to him; rafidah was overheard saying "no, no ... why?" before she pushed the microphones away so they could confer privately. the whole nation went into cardiac arrest, i imagine ... this was being broadcast live over one of their major television stations.  he retracted the decision an hour or so later, after an intense private conference with his closest aides. the entire UMNO assembly remained glued to their seats, insisting that they were not going to leave until they were sure that mahathir had rescinded his decision.   there's a photo of him on the front page, with a look of utter weariness and frustration on his face ... more than anyone, this is mahathir's country, something he's invested his entire life in. i suppose that logically, everyone knows he's mortal and that he's going to have to step down sometime, but no one's really been thinking about it. this decision just kind of forced everyone to take a good look at the tenuousness of the situation, how the stability and prosperity of an entire nation has been balanced on one man's shoulders. it's too much, and it always has been, but mahathir has never complained and never backed down.  this brings me to the question: if he steps down, what then?  life in asia - a perpetual transition. we all live on the edge of hope, clinging to family and traditions because they're all that's sane in a world that changes by the minute. huntington wrote "The Clash of Civilizations" aeons ago, and some parts of what he wrote is already obsolete, of course. but sometimes the world still feels frighteningly bipolar, a standoff between east and west, two worlds coexisting on the same planet. the west is frustrated by our dependence on our governments, and our paradoxical mistrust of them; we are mystified by their confidence in a world that we have never learned to trust fully.   when are we ever going to learn to speak each other's languages?

      in about a minute we're leaving for dance practice, so i can't stay long, and i can't really write out a long entry. but i just wanted to say that for the first time in weeks, i feel luminous again, healthy and ripe and glowing like a normal twenty-one year old. there's still that undercurrent - a frail, trembling notion of infertility beneath my skin, because i still haven't changed my mind about not having children - but it's self-inflicted rather than externally imposed, so it's bearable.  i mean, i never could bring myself to cut myself that deeply.  night isn't so scary nowadays, and my bed is suddenly cozy. it's lovely to be happy again.

      i know; it's full of faulty science and ungainly metaphors and awkward writing, but it was knocking around in my head and i had to exorcise it. forgive?  - - -  midnight.  she kneels, awkwardly, on her bed, shifting instinctively to keep her center of gravity on the soft uncertainty of the mattress. the springs, even buried where they are beneath layers of sponge and cloth, dig into her knees, and she can feel bruises forming where her bones jut hard against her skin. tomorrow there will be little blue spots on her knees, and she'll rub absently at them, not really remembering where they came from. it's just pain, just another sensation that gets absorbed and overlooked.  outside, the stars are burning, gaseous masses that glow so hard that she can see them from where she is, millions of light years away. they've been shining for years, she knows; in some cases they're so far away that by the time their light reaches the earth, the star itself is dead, gone nova and dwindled into a red giant, collapsing into a black hole. some of the stars she's watching, right at this very moment, are now dead and gone, and the lights in the sky where they used to be are empty - beauty without substance, warmth without actual fire.  it makes her hurt to think about it.  she liked looking at stars before, when she was younger. she had admired their constancy. no matter what happened, no matter where she was, she knew that as soon as the sun went down, she could open her window and look up, and they would be there. the big dipper. ursula major. orion. castor and pollux. if she stayed up long enough, scorpio and cancer. there was a harmony to their movements, a certainty to their dance, a pattern that they could not break.  the first time they had moved, she had lain awake all night, scared of her strange bed and the strange sounds. the next night, her father had taken her to the window and pointed out the big dipper, and before she knew it, they were starwatching.  that's the north star,  her father had said. she can remember his voice, the brush of his shirt against her jammies, the exact words he had spoken, as if it had been ten minutes ago.  the stars move, did you know that? it's like a big slideshow. the earth turns around and we see different stars, but there's one star that doesn't change.   years down the road, bigger and older and wiser, she can still hear her own voice, tiny and piping.  the north star,  she had echoed, and down the years, as she watches the night sky, she hears her father laughing proudly.   that's right, my girl,  he said.  people used that star to find their way home.   they had fallen silent then, eyes fixed on the wide scrolling brilliance above them.  daddy,  she'd said, her voice sounding even tinier,  i don't like it when things change. everything gets so strange and my tummy gets nervous and my body feels funny, like it's forgotten what it's supposed to do.   her father had not looked back down at her, but continued to look up at the sky.  things change, honey,  he'd said.  that's just the way it is.    the northern star doesn't,  she'd retorted then, and he'd finally looked down at her, a slight smile on his face. she can't remember what his eyes looked like. in the semi-dark, his face had been clouded, and although she could see the glint of his teeth, his eyes were shadowed. there was something strange, something ...  then he spoke, and his voice was daddy's, and his warmth was daddy's, and it didn't matter that for a moment, he'd looked like a stranger.  that's right, honey,  he agreed.  the northern star doesn't change.   she remembered that so clearly. the year after that, her family had packed up and moved again, to another country where the people didn't speak her language and looked at her with eyes that examined and weighed, that measured her and found her strange. that first night, listening to her brother making small distressed noises in his sleep, and the unfamiliar noises that all sounded creepy, she had gotten up and gone to the window. as her father had told her, the north star was there. hours melted away as she stared out at it, her hand pressed hard against the glass as if she could draw it to her by sheer will. when the sky had begun to lighten, silver streaks forming in the previous unbroken darkness of the sky, she had gone back to bed and slept.  they had moved several more times after that, from city to city, from one country to another. it had become a habit; every time she found herself in a strange bed, a strange place, she would stay up long enough to go to the window alone and look for the north star. it was always there. in her first year of college, she had broken up with her high school sweetheart. she had moped about it for days, huddled in the dark of her dorm room while her roommates gave her sympathetic looks and crept out to give her privacy. on the third day she had tried to call home, only to receive a taped message; her parents weren't home either. alone in a strange city, cut loose from the one thing that had bound her to all the familiarity of her old life, she had returned to her childhood habit of watching the stars.  tomorrow is her graduation day. her friends lie scattered on the floor and couch and bed, worn from the last hurrah they'd held earlier. she's the last one awake, unable to sleep. two weeks ago, her mother had called her, voice thick and blurry with weariness and hurt. strange that she can remember words spoken by her father years ago, and that something her mother told her just two weeks past is vague in her memory. she can't remember the words, only the way they were said, and the dull empty way she'd sat, cradling the phone long after her mother had hung up.   things hurt and people change. she knows that. a lifetime on the move, a childhood spent learning and relearning societal norms that differed from place to place, a heart that knows only her immediate family and the north star as constants - these have shaped her. she doesn't ask for much, really. she doesn't cry for the impossible.  but some things - some impossible things could have been possible, she thinks, in a surge of anger. if people tried harder. if they valued things more. she'd said the same to her father over the phone last month, when he'd called and tried to explain.  you're nothing but a big cop-out,  she'd hissed, her voice turning thin and ragged. she imagined bones jutting out from it, rough and jagged at the broken edges, glistening with blood from where it had ripped through skin and muscle. she'd wanted him to hurt like that.  he'd sounded defensive, and tired beneath the hardness.  try to understand,  he pleaded.  people grow apart. things change - i needed someone who understood -    she'd put the phone down then.  she's still kneeling at the window, staring at the stars but not seeing them. behind her, a friend stirs, groans.  i think i had too much to drink,  he says. a slight pause, and the rustling sounds of him getting to his feet.  what are you doing up?   there is a brief silence.  thinking,  she says.    anything interesting?  he has moved to stand beside her, peering out the window. she can see his reflection in the glass, feel his warmth beside her, and is struck by the incongruity of life. he is a stranger made familiar by four years of camaraderie, a random person made dear by time and proximity.   just wondering,  she says,  about the stars. you know how we can see their light, but not really know whether they still exist? i mean, since it takes so long for their light to reach earth. by the time we see them shine, they might be black holes.   he scratches his head and stretches.  hell of a time to be thinking about physics,  he grumbles.  she shrugs, smiling a little.  i guess. i was just thinking - what if the northern star was like that? i mean, we trust it, you know? people get lost or confused or whatever and they look for the northern star to get their bearings. but - what if it weren't real anymore? what if they were just seeing its light, and the real northern star was nothing but a hole in the sky?    dunno,  he mutters, searching the star out with his eyes. she grabs his hand, extending his pointer finger, and guides it until it rests just under the pinpoint of light that is the northern star.  that's a tough one. i mean, don't we have instruments that measure that kind of stuff?   she is insistent:  hypothetically.   they breathe together, waiting in silence, as he ponders. the reflection of light on glass makes it difficult to see his eyes, and in a brief moment of unexplainable panic, she turns to look at his face. his head is thrown back, his eyes thoughtful, and she relaxes, returning her gaze to the star in question.   i don't know,  he finally says.  i guess if i were an astronomer, that would have some deep scientific significance or something. but i'm not, so ...  he drifts off into silence again, his finger dropping from the window pane.  i guess it doesn't matter much. i mean, those people found their way home, right? whether the star was actually there or not.   she turns to look at him, and finds him looking at her, too. they stand, staring at each other as they consider his words. she breaks the silence first, with a slow smile.  makes sense to me,  she murmurs, squeezing his hand and moving off the bed.  makes a lot of sense.   outside, the northern star glows.

      Okay, this falls into the "strange but true" category. I first mentioned it at an intellectual rights seminar I attended last month. The rep from the Swedish Embassy was completely amused, as were the people from the firm that sponsored the seminar; they asked me several times whether I was joking. Well, I wasn't, and here's the story.  The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) is one of the biggest telecommunications companies in the Philippines. For a while, it was the ONLY telecom company in the Philippines (yes, folks, you can say it with me: MONOPOLY, and not of the ambiguous Bill Gates kind either). Sometime in the 1990s, the government decided to privatize the telecommunications industry. This was due to several reasons - the most obvious of which, of course, that it's not healthy to have a monopoly in any industry. If you have no competition then there's no burning need to improve your services, and PLDT, in a lot of ways, was a shining example of this.  Por ejemplo : if anyone remembers, back in the days before privatization, it took almost forever to get a phone line. You filled out the application, you sent it in ... and then two or three years later, PLDT would send you an initial reply.   As you can imagine, this irritated consumers. One particularly annoyed customer took his war to the Internet - and in so doing, discovered that the Philippines' premier (well, it  was  the premier back then because we had no choice) telecommunications company had apparently not discovered the Internet yet. Having made this strange and perplexing discovery, he cheerfully purchased and registered the domain  urlLink pldt.com , and used it as a platform to voice out all that he found objectionable about PLDT.  When PLDT, the slug, found out about this, it was Outraged (yes, with a capital O). They had to settle for registering the domain name  urlLink pldt.com.ph , and did so. However, it still rankled deeply that someone was using their own name against them, so they filed a lawsuit - a major company against a private individual, whose case has since become a cause celebre for all annoyed consumers in the Philippines. The battle is still ongoing, and the site is still up. The owner of the website has since expanded his website's coverage to include critiques of national and international goings-on. It's quite sarcastic, irreverent, and roll-in-the-aisles funny - unless, of course, you're the one it's targeted at. In which case it ceases to be funny, but ain't that the way it's always been.  To this day, if you go to the address line and type in http://www.pldt.com, you will be directed to an anti-PLDT website. Call it the leftover anarchist in me, but little ironies like this are just plain hilarious. Incidentally, this site was set up a looooong time ago, and I'd almost forgotten about it. I was reminded of its existence by  urlLink a similar incident  involving another company, and thought it might be of interest - to trivia freaks and the easily amused, at the very least.

      to all my former teachers and professors and advisers: consider this an apology from a former class terror. you'll be glad to know that i have amended my ways; instead of staying in class and sleeping or playing tag or getting into big dramatic arguments with teachers and fellow students alike, i now save everybody the time and trouble and just cut class.  really, it's so thoughtful of me.  having said that, i am now experiencing what some would call karmic backlash; i teach basic computer at the embassy's skills training center twice a month and let me just say it's not easy. trying to impart practical computer skills to people who have no experience whatsoever with the computer, and have little to no access to computers at all, is close to impossible. it crosses the border into ridiculous when you factor in the fact that there are no working computers in the lab. in effect, i am a computer teacher without computers.  yesterday was one of the most trying days. we've had a lot of suspended classes this semester, for one reason or another, and i finally decided to break my no-makeup-classes rule and hold one for my students just so we could make up for lost time. i lived to regret that decision, as it turns out; it resulted in my having to teach SEVEN hours straight, from 10:30AM to 5:30PM.  a short backgrounder: the skills training center is a branch of the embassy's labor office, and it holds skills development classes for overseas filipino workers in kuala lumpur. the classes are held every sunday; the courses available range from basic computer training to basic nursing and homecare. ninety-nine percent of the students are maids, and a scattered few are housewives and/or relatives of overseas filipino workers who are looking for something better to do with their time. the teachers are filipino professionals working or living in KL; most, like my mother, are professionals who are here on a dependent's visa, and are thus not allowed to work. all of them are volunteers.  i teach basic computer 1, and just started this semester. how and why a polisci-major-slash-MBA-student-slash-government-flunky ended up teaching computer in kuala lumpur is a long and involved story, but let's just say there were three major reasons: first, the previous computer teacher got a life, and wanted out of teaching the course; second, my mother decided i had too much free time on my hands and needed to do something worthwhile with my time; and third, i decided it was time to quit whining about how rotten it was in the state of the philippines and start doing something about it. long story short, i found myself agreeing to teaching basic computer twice a month - three two-hour classes every two weeks.  at any rate, due to the make-up classes i promised, i found myself with an even more insane teaching schedule than usual - while i usually have a one hour break between my morning class and my two afternoon classes, this time i had none, PLUS an hour-long extension for my last class. all this, on top of the fact that i had to wake up at 7AM to attend the 8AM service at church - a service i usually don't attend because i'm never awake before 10AM, but ended up attending this year due to my crazy teaching schedule.  so. wake up at 7, attend church at 8, skip out on the post-sermon rituals by 9:30, and arrive at the center by 9:45. not being a masochist, i went straight to my classroom to leave a message on the board:  class starts at 10:30. eat, drink, be merry, and prepare intelligent questions for the makeup class discussion.  then i went back downstairs to have breakfast - a nice, relaxed breakfast with my family such as we never get to have nowadays.  my first discovery, upon going back to my classroom at 10:30, was that none of the computers were working. none. nary a one. i had a classroomful of expectant, eager students on my hands, an introductory session to teach, and no computer to produce a demo on. well, UP students - or UP alumni, as the case may be - are nothing if not resourceful; i went back downstairs and got a whiteboard marker. if i couldn't turn on a computer and show them what i was talking about, then, by golly, i was going to draw them a picture and confuse them even more with my horrific drawing skills.  at around 12 noon, i decided to give myself and my students a break, and announced that we would have a five-minute break. upon which one student piped up  but when are we going to eat?  i gave her my best you've-got-to-be-kidding-me look.  class started at 10:30, i pointed out. if thirty minutes was not enough time for you to have a nice big breakfast, then i don't know what is.    but i have a class from 1 to 3,  she whined.   i have a class from 1 to 3, another one from 3 to 5, and a makeup session from 5 to 6,  i replied.  your point?  whereupon the other students started giving her dirty looks, and she subsided. i relented a little bit:  look,  i reminded them,  you asked for this time slot. i gave it to you. and if you remember, i gave you all permission to bring sandwiches or snacks to class, so that you could nibble on something if you got hungry. i'm not inhuman, but give me a break, okay? i'm not your mother either.   irritating students and hectic schedule notwithstanding, i had a relatively good time. one of my students, frighteningly honest, raised her hand during the Q&A session to ask  how do you use the computer without your employer finding out?  six months ago, i would have laughed and thought she was joking. these days, i know she speaks with heartfelt honesty and an earnest desire to know. eighty percent of my students have never touched a computer; ninety-eight percent are not allowed to handle their employers' computers, and fear reprisal should they do so. there's the blessed two percent, who either own computers or are allowed to use the computers at home, but as you can see from the numbers, they are in the sad majority. at any rate, everyone laughed and i had to give a brief smile, but it was obvious that they wanted a real, honest-to-God answer.  for once, i was grateful for the ribbing and teasing that ensued; it gave me a little while to organize my thoughts and figure out how to respond.  first of all,  i said, once everyone had calmed down,  i know that a lot of you don't have access to computers at home, and that you'd hoped to be able to practice on actual computers during this course. as you all know, we haven't been able to do so very often this semester, and i'm very sorry. it's a ridiculous situation - a computer class without computers - but it's a situation that can't be helped at the time, so we'll just have to make do. second, i realize it's difficult for a lot of you to understand and visualize what we discuss in class, since you don't have computer experience, but i appreciate the fact that you're all making an effort nonetheless. having said that, i'd like to tell you that - i'm sorry - there is no surefire way of using a computer without your employers finding out, and at any rate it's wrong to use something that's not yours without permission. so. two things,  i said, to a class that was surprisingly silent and listening with full attention.  number one, don't use your employers' computers - or any of their stuff - without their permission. there's no two ways about it, you'll just have to ask their permission and live with whatever they decide. number two - IF they decide to allow you to use their things, DON'T abuse the privilege. use only what you need to use, work only with the programs and buttons you understand, and leave the rest strictly alone. is that absolutely, positively clear?   i still feel for them, though. our computer lab does have computers, but a lot of them are either out-of-order or under repair, and since i'm just an experienced user and not a technician in any way, i daren't touch them either. these women (and one man) really want to learn, and for that desire alone, they deserve complete, working equipment. they're amazingly cheerful and resilient, too, despite the kinds of lives they lead. the other week i was discussing one of my students with my sister, and she just shook her head when i was done.  i don't think i could teach at the center,  she said, quietly.  how do you not break down and cry every time you hear their stories?   the answer is simple, if a little cold: by not thinking too much about it. if i think about it, it builds up and grows and becomes my pain instead of theirs, and that's wrong. it's not my pain, it's theirs; they need the help, so much much more than i do.  all those songs and dances and pretty political ads in the philippines about how the overseas filipino worker is a modern hero - they're useless and pointless and insulting in their inadequacy. don't enshrine them, you crocodiles. they don't need the pedestals.  HELP them.

      moving is a bitch. i had to leave my cat and her three kittens behind, and tomorrow we're bringing them to the SPCA.  they kill them if no one adopts them within a week,  my sister pointed out, as we lay on the floor of our emptied former house, running our fingers over the soft exposed bellies of our kittens.  i tried not to think of that, tried not to think of soft little pink noses and trusting dark eyes closed and stilled and cold forever.  i'd rather they be dead than starving and abandoned and cold on the streets,  i said instead, with the downy milk-filled belly of one kitten moving drowsily beneath my stroking fingers. their eyes have just opened, and they still look rather cross-eyed, and they're beautiful babies.  sometimes i hate moving, and i hate strange beds, and i know i told E that i'm used to sleeping in strange beds, but isn't that such an oxymoron? and more than anything, i hate leaving things behind and cutting things off, viciously, because it'll hurt more to let it drag out and linger.  so. i don't care about those kittens, and i don't care about my cat, and i won't dream about the way she looked at me when i sang her to sleep.  i won't.

      i suppose i should be intelligent and rational and analytical about  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  and oh God,  urlLink THIS , but i don't want to be and at 11PM in the evening after a difficult day, i can't be. the papers are beginning to depress me. i log onto  urlLink The Inquirer  every day, or at least a couple times a week, to keep up-to-date on what's going on in my country. is it too much, i ask of you, to give me good news?  i know. whatever you're going to tell me, believe me, i've heard it before. someone actually told me once  you have no right to suffer because you don't even live here. you don't KNOW what it's like.  that's not strictly true; i lived in the philippines for a little over eight years, starting from 1992, when electricity was functional for only four hours a day and water only came on from 2AM to 4AM. kidnappings and rape-slays were the crime-du-jour. (yes, virginia; even crimes go by trends in manila. bombings are now apparently THE crime of the day. rape-slay? dahling. you are too, too passé.) six months after we arrived, a drugged up man stabbed a fifteen-year-old boy to death in front of our house as we listened, terrified, in our rooms. fifteen minutes after the boy died, the neighbors came out in full force with bats and pipes and started beating the killer up, and all i could think was  what's the point? the boy's dead. you're fifteen minutes too late.   but okay. let's take for granted that i have spent more than half of my life outside of the philippines, and that given this situation, i may not be fully aware of the situation in the philippines. tell you what; let's swap. you stay here, i'll stay there. i'll go through your traffic and your corrupted politicians and your urban poor, the ones whose shoulders are tense with violence and whose eyes are beaten and resigned. i'll live through your rallies and turbulence and impossibly high cost of living vis-a-vis the low wage levels. i'll rub shoulders with the disenfranchised and marginalized, the people who have no names and no voices and no way to tell us that they exist and bleed. i'll do that.  you - you come here and line up at their immigration counters. hold out your passport and see their faces change when they see your nationality. listen, burning in angry silence, while they harass your mother because they think she's a maid, and refrain from doing anything because after all, it's not your country. go to places and watch the eyes of men change when they learn your nationality; learn to duck their leering, wandering hands as they whisper  filipinas are pretty women  in your ear, and make it sound like an insult. go to class and listen to people lambast your country's politics and government, and the awkward, embarrassed silence when they realize that you are there. go to the embassy and watch the runaway maids creep in, red-eyed and bruised and terrified, and watch them cower against a wall no matter how kind you are being, simply because it's been so long since they've known kindness. you do that.  then you come back and look me in the eye and tell me i don't understand. capisce?  i know it's not all sweetness and light in our country. i am not asking for a cover-up. i am not asking for a whitewash. and, God forbid, i am not asking for lies.   all i want is a little hope from you, you know? give me a little optimism, something to grab on to when everything seems bleak. tell me that maybe it's not ok now, but it will get better, because if it's not, what are we alive for? what am i here for? what am i doing here, standing here and loving my country with all that i have, if my country is going to be nothing but bullshit in three years? what was my father's generation's fight for freedom worth, if you degrade our country like this?  hope for me. hope with me. our country needs a second chance, dammit, and if no one else will offer it, we should.  damn it.

      my eyes are burning, burning. late night last night - had to attend a farewell party for the ambassador, hosted by one of the business associations my office works closely with. like i've said, i LOVE dressing up and going out - there's something electric about red lipstick, black stockings and high heels that just tilts your chin up and makes you walk sweepingly, like an actress - but not when it's required. not when it's a work thing.  not to say that it didn't turn out well - it was a very small, intimate sort of gathering, and despite the ultra-formal setting, people were chatting comfortably and easily with each other. there were no long-winded speeches or emotional outbursts - the farewell speeches and gift-giving probably took up no less than fifteen minutes, all told, and that's a generous estimate. by 10:30PM, PH (that's my colleague, not a chemical measurement) and i were standing out in front of the hotel, waiting for our respective rides home. on the other hand, i was still charged up from all the socializing and whatnot, so it took me a good three hours to settle down once i got home.  this morning did not help, either. i came in to a pile of work, all marked either  urgent  or  v. urgent - today, pls.  for five minutes i just sat at my desk staring at them, because i don't function like a human being until after 10AM. after which i shuffled them around, closed my eyes, plunged my hand into the pile and pulled out one, and that was what i did first. so it's not a scientific method, sue me. you should have seen my boss's face when he walked in on me covering my eyes with one hand and groping for a paper with the other. he can't blame it on my education, though, because we graduated from the same university.  by 10:30 i was alone in the office - my boss had gone off for various meetings, and PH had just left to drop some stuff off at the airport. i had about ten minutes of glorious peace before the other shoe fell and chaos descended again. my boss called to tell me that i had to tell PH to bring him some extra calling cards; two people walked in and informed me that they wanted to make a trade inquiry; one of the manila offices called on the other phone to ask for information on an upcoming event. i called PH on one phone, and while waiting for her to pick up, continued talking to the manila office on the other phone, pausing briefly to ask the walk-in clients to take a seat, i'd be with them shortly. they had amazing poker faces; it must have been quite amusing to walk in on a girl holding two phones to her head with her shoulders, writing down something with one hand and scrabbling for papers with another, but their faces remained absolutely expressionless.  at any rate, i managed to handle everything. how, i'm not quite sure - i vaguely remember pushing a handful of brochures at the clients and telling them to look through them, just before dashing off to answer the phone again. PH turned up five minutes later; i dragged her into the door, begging her in a harried whisper to handle the clients while i answered the phone (which was ringing, YET AGAIN). she didn't stay long, though - just long enough to give the clients even more brochures, then she was out the door with a box of calling cards.  when i'd settled the phone issue once and for all (by leaving the phone off the hook, mwahaha), i went over and finally spoke to the clients, who looked immensely relieved that i seemed relatively sane. ten minutes and a lot of handshakes later, they left carrying a mountainload of brochures and my assurances that they could return if they needed more information; i put the phone back on its hook and collapsed in my chair, laughing hysterically.  hence when E called me (from taipei, of all places) twenty minutes later, i was still charged with all the adrenaline i'd worked up during that mad rush. he accused me of drugging myself up with caffeine, i staunchly defended my honor against his false allegations, and we ended up talking a lot of nonsense about how he could walk down to KL from taipei and we could maybe swim to manila for a cup of espresso. to all filipinos reading this journal, i'm sorry. government workers ARE insane, you're right to be suspicious of us. or at the very least, E is definitely certifiable. i'm still borderline, although on the border of what exactly, i don't know.  i'm in the eye of the storm at the moment, typing out this entry during a brief lull. tomorrow my day will start at 5:30AM because i have to help check-in a VIP at the airport before 8AM, and if the embassy doesn't provide protocol officers, i will end up carting his (and his delegation's) luggage all the way from the hotel to the airport. alone. E seems to think that should be no problem for me, but like i told him, i am NOT The Rock.  laugh with me, folks. we'll see where the day goes from here.

      i admit i have a soft spot for  urlLink mindanao , since both my parents were born and raised there - in the heartland of the ARMM, or the autonomous region of muslim mindanao. how they came to be born and raised there is a whole other saga entirely, since my mother's family originally comes from nueva ecija in luzon, and my dad's family - well, the maternal side of it, at least - comes from cebu. dad's paternal grandfather was a landowner on negros occidental, i think, but like i said, unearthing my philippine roots would reveal a story worthy of judy ann santos' tearjerking soap operas. it's long and interesting and mind-boggling, really.  at any rate, i've been to mindanao, and it's a lovely place - the town where my parents met and grew up is both provincial and sophisticated at the same time, with illiterate farmers mingling and mixing freely with the intelligentsia of the town university. nothing at all like the mindanao depicted in the international press, with its bloodthirsty terrorist groups hiding out in jungles, preying on unsuspecting tourists, scuba divers, and missionaries. recently we've had a lot of events going on in mindanao, and every time we call up someone to invite them, we get the same question: mindanao? isn't that the place, you know, with the terrorists?  so if that question was indeed running through your mind, rest assured: mindanao is a huge island. the area that bristles with terrorists is a mere one fiftieth, if that, of the entire island, and it's located far south, toward sabah. while they may have enjoyed a greater range of power previously, the recent and concentrated war against terrorism has driven them back into a couple of isolated islands, where they are rapidly being picked off.  mindanao is a sad story in and and of itself, actually. being so far from the nation's center (which would be manila), it hasn't received a lot of attention - financially or politically. in FVR's time, attempts were made to develop mindanao through the SPCPD (the southern philippine council for peace and development), which was headed by nur misuari. we all know how that turned out - misuari milked mindanao dry, took people hostage when people started to point accusing fingers, then ran to malaysia to hide. luckily malaysia delivered him back to the philippines by the scruff of his neck, to face the consequences of his greed. vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, but the fleshly part of me wants the philippine government to just turn him loose in a crowd of mindanaoans - the very people that he embezzled from - and leave him to his fate.  in an unrelated note, nur misuari used to teach political science at the mindanao campus of my university. isn't that scary?  after FVR came estrada, who didn't really care. if i remember correctly, part of the reason people were furious at estrada was because toward the end of his bumbling reign, the abu sayyaf were waxing in strength, taking hostages with such ease that they'd begun almost to make a business out of it. (rumor has it that there was an argument between commander global and commander robot [where DO they get these aliases, by the way? Voltes V comic books?] to the effect that global didn't want to share the ransom money, and told robot to go and "kidnap his own hostages".)  currently we have gloria, who vowed to wage a full-scale war against terrorism and to enhance efforts to develop mindanao. it's about time, seriously; part of the reason there's such strong anti-government sentiment in mindanao is because they've felt ignored for so long, shunted aside in favor of the needs and demands of the capital region. gloria is fighting two wars in mindanao, actually - the more public one against terrorism, and the private, more down-home war to regain mindanao's trust.  personally, i think a government initiative will not be enough; they need to educate the private sector as well, and enlist their support. this all-out effort to get foreign investors interested in mindanao will fizzle out pretty quickly if those same foreign investors figure out that domestic investors are themselves not interested. i mean, wouldn't you be doubtful about investing in a place where not even the locals want to go?  given this kind of history, news like  urlLink this  irritates all heck out of me. mindanao is part of the philippines, not a separate country, and it should be treated as such - given an equal chance, at least. it's the crab mentality all over again.  life in the philippines - a carnival that will not stop. i  did  warn you, right?

      dusk at my window is a lovely thing. if i've whined about how small and stuffy my room is, i've done it a million times, but i love my window. it faces the west, catching the light as the sun sets, and in those red-and-orange moments, everything in my room comes alight with firecolor. when the sky ripens, purpling like a day-old bruise, so does my room, twinging with shadows in unexpected places.  and when the light stops playing and settles down, down, coiling itself up like the poet's "gorgeous snake" and losing us in the shimmer of darkness, that's when the stars come out. in the quietest of moments, when my house sleeps, i kneel at my window and breathe, and nothing matters but this.  the world empties, tipping itself out and shaking loose of what it has collected over the day. you can almost hear the crackle and tinkle of accumulated insignificances: there goes that annoying client who always asks you to do the impossible and gets mad if it fails to happen; here falls the irritating next-door neighbor whose cigarette smoke fouls up the entire floor's air. everything superfluous is removed, falling loose the way pins are stripped from a woman's hair. this is the lightest and easiest moment of the day.  tomorrow i start over again, emptied and replete all at once, stripped of insignificant irritants and filled with the trust of stars and wind and breath. this is what keeps me going, and this is what makes me smile in strange moments.  dusk at my window, and tomorrow riding on the edge of the very last star. there are always reasons to live, but this is my favorite one.

      yaz sent  urlLink this  over to me just a while ago, and in accordance with my vile, cynical, and completely irrational mood, i would just like to say to all the politicians: SHUT. UP. just shut up. zip the lips, lock your clocks, throw away the keys, and MOVE. i'm sick and tired of press conferences where they express "indignation" and "offense". please. we're a third world country in hock to more than half of the countries around the world, we don't have much room for all this chest-puffing. just - please. tell the press "we are currently addressing this situation", then shut up and go on with your life. this is one person in perhaps seventy million who feels that way, but please, i'm begging you. we don't have time to sit around and blabber, we need to go DO something.  and to the philippine media: how sad to think that i once thought i wanted to be one of you. i wanted to tell the truth, and i believed that if there was one institution in the country left that still held that virtue intact, it was the media. well, i was wrong. the philippine press enjoys more freedom than most press institutions in asia - than most press institutions anywhere, i guess you could say. but freedom is not carte blanche to go out there and say whatever the hell you like, take the truth and manipulate it or twist it or put a spin to it or chop it up and rearrange it so it looks different. you have a responsibility, made all the greater by the weight of your freedom. i - and many other people like me - are frighteningly dependent on the media to provide us with news that is true and honest and unbiased. when the media fails, then this frightens me, because who then can i trust? i belong to a society that extends far beyond my miniscule network of family and friends, and yet if i cannot trust any institution outside of that network, i might as well cede citizenship and live like a hermit on an island, belonging to no country and protected by no one.  i'm sorry. it's been a long day, i'm tired, this entry will get deleted tomorrow, but for now this stands because  this is how i feel.

      so, the embassy stories, as i promised yaz and G.    story the first:    this takes place a few years ago, in hongkong, where one of the maids (let's call her evie) who is currently a student in the embassy skills training center, used to work. one day, her employer decided that she no longer wanted evie as an employee, and told her that she wanted to terminate her contract. the story would have been over and done by then, and you would have been spared my pathetic attempts at storytelling, if not for one little thing: evie's contract had a clause in it saying that she could not be terminated without legitimate cause. the employer HAD no legitimate cause; she just didn't like evie anymore. take note: she didn't like EVIE, personally; there was no problem with the way evie worked.  well, evie refused to leave; of course life is difficult when your employer hates your guts, but then she had mouths to feed at home, and that pretty much superseded many of her reasons for leaving. her employer was in a bind until one day she came up with a supergenius solution: she drew up a termination contract in cantonese, presented it to evie, and told her to sign.   here we take a short commercial break for me to explain one thing: this is one of the biggest problems faced in labor disputes. the labor attaché does negotiations, there is a verbal agreement between both parties, then just before they leave he takes the filipino worker aside and warns them, in our native tongue, not to sign any contract without reading it carefully.  if you don't understand it,  he stresses, don't sign.  not even if they force you to. call me first and let me see the contract, and then you can sign it in my presence to prove that you're not being coerced.  two months later the worker calls, crying, to say that her employer is now claiming that she is contractually obligated to feed them with the blood from her veins and the flesh of her body, or something like that. of course, the attaché then blows a gasket, his normally pleasant face turning red with infuriated frustration.  did you sign a contract?  he asks, and the answer is almost always yes.  we were forced,  they tell us.  they said they wouldn't pay us if we didn't sign.   back to evie. she took one look at the contract and, bless her heart, refused to sign.  i can't sign that,  she told her employer.  it's in chinese. i'll have to ask one of the embassy staff to translate it for me first.   the employer, taken aback, tried to cajole her first -  don't worry, it's just a standard form,  she said.  you need to sign this to process your employment.  evie, bless her heart a second time, still refused to sign, saying that she would only sign it if and when (a) she was given a copy in english, and she was permitted to sign the english copy; or (b) it was turned over to be translated by embassy staff, after which she would sign the translated copy.  and i want to sign it in front of the labor attaché,  she told her employer. well, the employer was infuriated - and hell hath no fury, you know the rest. evie says that for the next couple of weeks, her employer did all she could to force her to sign - until one day, she was no longer able to resist.  before you bust an artery screaming at your screen "no evie! don't do it! don't do it!" just like my grandma and i used to do back when we were watching those cheesy mexican telenovelas (whoops, too much information right there), let me reassure you - this story has a happy ending, otherwise i wouldn't be joking, i'd be stringing virtual heads on a string.  at any rate, evie gave in and told her employer  ok, i'll sign.  so her employer gave her the document and pen, and stood over her as she signed.   however, evie didn't sign her real name - and no, she didn't sign something predictable and lame like  gabriela silang  or  peter rabbit , like i (and a couple other people) probably would have. no. evie was smarter than us, yo.  instead, she signed  pinipilit ako  (i am being forced) with a flourish, and the employer took the document away for safekeeping.  a couple weeks later they were arguing again about her termination, and her employer whipped out the document with a triumphant air.  you see this?  she asked evie.  you signed this paper that says that you are leaving my employ of your own free will, therefore you are legally bound to do so otherwise i will sue you and have you deported.    i want to speak to my labor attaché,  evie said.   but you signed a legal document,  her employer informed her.  there's nothing he can do about that.   evie just shrugged.  let's see.   on they went to the embassy, where the labor attaché stared at the document before turning to the employer.  i'm not sure what you want me to do,  he said, as the employer had pulled it out of her purse voluntarily and put it before him as "proof".   do?  the employer spluttered, no doubt wondering if all filipinos were terminally stubborn.  it's very clear. that document says that she is asking to break her contract - you can have it translated if you like - and she has signed it.    well, no she hasn't,  the attaché replied, looking stern.  according to this note here, she was forced to sign this document.   that's pretty much all she wrote. evie went back to a more secure contract, and the employer was fined.  if i had half her survival instinct, i could live on an island with nothing but a bottle of water for a year.

      i know every girl's worst fear is that she'll turn into her mother, but what if your mother is the one trying to make you into herself?  urlLink laya , all i can think of is that maybe it's part of the separation process - where your mother still has difficulty separating you from the embryonic version of you that depended on her for everything; WAS her, in essence, since you gestated inside her body for nine months. it's difficult, pulling all those sticky little love-hooks out of you, especially when it's your mother who's stuck them in.  no one guilts like a mom.  i'm afraid i can't quite sympathize, though. my mother and i have always been polar opposites, so we get along better than most mothers and daughters. it's my sister who feels the threat of being sucked into her, and who threatens my mother with her similarity.  me ... strangely, i've always been more like a son than a daughter. ever since i was a very little girl, i knew, somehow, that i was being groomed to be my father's successor. he would take me to his office during summer vacations and leave me to browse through his papers while he buried himself in his work and forgot i existed. then i got older and it was the seminars he took me to, the papers he made me read, the universities i applied to and the course i chose.  i wanted to be a journalist and he wanted me to be an economist like him, and even then it felt like drowning - to be sucked into a field where everything i did would be perceived as toddling in my father's footsteps. we eventually compromised on political science, but the two fields intersect so much nowadays that sometimes we wander into arguments without meaning to.  even outside of academia and work, i'm my father's son. we're not tactile. i've never been able to throw myself into his arms, not even when i was very little. my mother tells me that i used to sit down across from him while he was working and talk to him levelly, and he would talk to me the same way, as if we were conducting business.  i don't remember this,  i said.   you were three,  she replied.  it's not something you'd remember easily.   it's still the way i talk to him: short, professional. i get embarrassed when i cry in front of him. he still looks slightly bewildered when he wanders in and i'm doing something girly, like putting on makeup or fussing with my hair. he is not afraid or overly concerned when i go out late at night, because he knows i can take care of myself.  and it's strange, but he's the only father i have, and i'm his only rei.

      i'm 22. well. technically twenty-two and a couple weeks, but what are a couple of weeks in the grand scheme of things?  at least that was what i told my mother back in september, when we were doing something mother-daughter-bonding-ish. i referred to myself as 22, she said that i wasn't twenty-two for a week or so yet, and i replied  what are a few days?  then explained to her that it was part of my grand overarching scheme to ease myself into my new ages, as they come. it's a personal tradition i started when i was 16; every year i would have to reposition myself - hold back my hand from writing 15 or 14 or whatever on the forms, and stop my mouth from forming the syllables of my former age. it got too tiring, wiggling around uncomfortably in the first few months of my new age, and i decided i'd start breaking myself in. so far, it's working. i suppose when i break past the calendar years (the filipino - don't know if it's used anywhere else - euphemism for any age past 31) i'll stop doing it, but for now: 22 is a comfortable age, and i don't mind accelerating the aging process.  consider this the inevitable Contemplation on Aging post. last year, if i remember correctly, i was moaning about being unformed and unfocused, all those things you're not supposed to be at twenty-one. in another journal, a non-online one, i wrote something like this:  what i really am, at this age, is a paper donkey that older people pin their hopes, like false tails, on. we're blinded by our incapability to see the future, and sometimes our refusal to see what's right there in front of us, and sometimes the things they pin on me, on people my age - they don't fall in the right places. and it hurts. sometimes i just want to be fifty and sure, with a past to look comfortably back on and laugh at, instead of here with crossroads branching out, and no real idea of which road i should be taking.   but that wasn't what i was thinking of, today. last night a friend called me up, fresh from her first semester as a UP student. she was enthusiastic and excited, and even over the phone i could hear barely-contained wonder in her voice.  there's so much to do,  she marvelled.  i wake up and i never know what's going to happen next.   and i smiled, remembering trees afire with flowers, and huge murals set directly on our main road, and eager fine arts freshies in pure black outfits and blazingly orange hair. we parted with a promise to meet up on Friday, bond over coffee, then head on out to a birthday party, filipino-style - which is to say, held at a karaoke bar. then i went to bed and woke up this morning thinking of UP, and of firsts.  i have a fondness for firsts, but i suspect we all do; it's easier to remember the first time you did something, the first time something happened. there's something new about it that time and cynicism finds hard to crease or wrinkle, something that makes us pack away our firsts in between sheets of paper, protect them so we can unwrap them in later years to think about again.  she was the epitome of firstness: barely-contained delight spilling over the phone, words stumbling over each other in an effort to describe what was still sinking in.  i was so scared at first,  she confided.  everybody knew where to go and they had friends, and all i had was me.    and what did you do?  i prodded, having had years of practice in big-sisterhood.   acted like i knew exactly what i was doing and where i was going so no one would think i was a freshie.  she paused, a little uncertain.  maybe that was a little arrogant?    did you get through the first day alive?  i asked, because that's the point of firsts, aside from their newness - surviving them.  she said yes, and i congratulated her, and on friday i will tell her that she'll remember that first day for the rest of her life. i remember mine, the way i remember all my firsts: with absolute clarity.  first day at college: fifteen years old, scared out of my mind and not sure who i wanted to be, hovering at the edges of the classroom. first road-trip: seventeen, with the joy of a new license, to a mountain with stars and my two best friends from highschool. first time i cut my hair shorter than shoulder-length: thirteen, and the sense-memory of how light my head felt, how my fingers would rake through my hair only to stop short at the blunted edges.  and today i thought: i'm twenty-two and i've had so many firsts, and won't it be beautiful when i'm eighty and have time to sort through them with careful hands.

       urlLink darmok and jilad at tanagra , and isn't it funny that it's so much easier for beings of different species to come to understandings than it is for us - all human beings, albeit of different colors and ideologies - to get along.  tomorrow morning i'll be attending a security briefing at the embassy, because violence and death has gotten frighteningly random. in maryland there's a sniper who picks them off like berries, and in bali they blew up a bar, and in zamboanga a mall exploded. there's no particular rhyme or reason anymore.  just a month or so back i couldn't imagine living in a world where every day was touch-and-go as to whether you'd make it back home alive, but i should've known, shouldn't i? i already do live in that world.

      i'm pissed.  i am NOT escaping, okay? if i were escaping, then i would either be facedown in a pool of water somewhere, or huddled up in a cozy white jacket, in a room full of very nice people with Ph.D.s in psychiatry. it's ridiculous to say that i'm escaping work by working, and it's not fair of you to tell me that i'm not being responsible.  i am not running away. i am dealing. i am coping with all of this insane work you are throwing at me because i want to be good for you, but it's so hard to be good for you when you keep on raising the bar.  - - -  on the non-self-involved bit: there was yet another bomb blast in zamboanga yesterday. PH sneaked in this morning to drop off some stuff (because technically, she's on leave today) and asked me,  sotto voce , if i'd seen the papers.  yep,  i said.  front page. good luck to whoever's going to promote the next mindanao event.   of course it sounds callous, but what else can you say? how do you put the color of fear and the shape of pain and the grating feel of frustration and hope and disappointment and anger into words?  so we didn't.

      in malaysian news: terengganu's state government has enacted  urlLink a law  that says that tourists must now also be segregated according to gender. females can only be taken around with a female guide, and males and females cannot tour together. even earlier on, kelantan banned females from performing in public because ... i don't know. some maggoty reason relating to their twisted way of interpreting God's will. these are the same people who decided that in order to press a rape charge, a woman had to produce four witnesses - not just any witnesses, but four Muslim men of good standing. failing that, she would be whipped for slander.   with that kind of a track record, it's kind of hard to listen to their  urlLink protestations of innocence . "we didn't know that they were going to enact it." that, i can believe, even if it sounds dumb. what i have trouble believing is that the CWC would have disapproved the ruling, even if it had been brought before them.  somewhere in between that, there was a policeman who raped - well, let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say he had sex with - two female inmates at a prison that he was a warden of. (and yes, i win for Most Convoluted Sentence In A Recently Published Journal. you may NOT send prizes or congratulations because my life sucks enough already.) despite testimonies and evidence that the sex was not in any way consensual, he was let off scot-free because, and let's quote the judge here, "there is no solid proof that it was rape ... the women did not scream, or struggle, or protest".   granted, there was massive outrage in the opinion pages, some of which - gratifyingly enough - came from the male part of the population. but outrage didn't help those two women, because they were sent back to prison and the policeman who raped them - ahem, "had sex with" them, because after all, he was acquitted - returned to his job after standing trial. in his own words, he was "glad for the vacation".  in addition: i do not at all see what point they are trying to make with  urlLink this . the girl was raped, period. what does it matter if she's filipino or malaysian or swahili? if it's the participation of the philippine government that irks you, then stick this in your boots and suck on it: (a) the girl admittedly has filipino blood, ergo the philippine government has some moral right to extend its protection over her and (b) your precious police/countrymen were not so nice about her nationality when they raped her.  in philippine news: i have no clue because i've stopped reading philippine newspapers. i am aware that this may cause me to fail the foreign service exams, which i may take next year, but at this point, i really don't care. after that entire sabah debacle - which, by the way, is still ongoing - i am not prone to believing what they say, in any way. granted the trust thing cuts both ways and you have no reason to believe that what i am saying in this journal IS indeed true; for all you know i could be an aggrieved citizen with a grudge against newspapers and governments in general. there is one major difference, though: this is not a profession. this is a personal journal, and that is caveat enough. if you're going to wear the title of "journalist", then for heaven's sake act like one and go verify your stories before they get published.  and yaz: you're right, none of this is making me particularly eager to reproduce. i know we sound like the last paranoid freaks on earth, but i would much rather not go down in history as the mother of my generation's ted bundy. 'cause you know that with my track record, i'd probably end up raising either a serial killer or a catatonic.

      there's a conversation between buffy and giles that i chanced across a long time ago, and never forgot because it was so true. post-slaying, after yet another night of death and standing between humanity and the apocalypse, buffy asks giles  does life ever get easy?  for moments after that, there are no words, only a silence defined by buffy's tired seventeen-year-old eyes, and giles' confounded, inadequate wisdom.   what do you want me to say?  he finally replies, helpless, and buffy says  lie to me,  almost like she's begging, and giles pauses slightly before doing just that.  yes, it's terribly simple,  he murmurs, going on about how completely easy it is to tell good from bad, how good always wins and evil always loses in the end.  buffy cuts him off with a soft  liar , and the scene ends there.  sometimes, you just need someone to lie to you.

      happy thanksgiving to all those who celebrated it. there IS a lot to be thankful for, despite the squabbling relatives, all the things that inevitably go wrong, and all the empty places that should not have been empty.  family holidays can be hard, because you want everything to be nice and normal, and sometimes it seems like no one's cooperating. but if it helps: no one's normal, and every family is slightly dysfunctional.  - - -   You better lose yourself in the music, the moment / You own it, you better never let it go / You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow / This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo  - eminem || lose yourself  JP e-mailed me once, way back when i'd first left the philippines, to ask what i thought of the latest eminem song. at the time, "the latest" was  stan , and i wrote JP back saying that as i didn't like eminem, i hadn't really listened to it, but that i'd keep it on the next time it came on the radio and write him back.  two days later it came on the radio. usually i'd listen to the first part - which was dido singing  my tea's gone cold, i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all  - and then switch the station as soon as eminem started rapping. this time, for JP, i kept the station on and listened. that evening i wrote him:  i still don't like the song as a whole, i said. but there's something about the way it's put together - about the way dido keeps on singing  it's not so bad, it's not so bad  while eminem is screaming his lungs out. it's like she's saying  i'm not going to let this psycho take me down, i'm not going to let him forget that i've got hope.   you have strange interpretations,  JP replied.  two years later, i'm looking at yet another eminem song. he disturbs me because i know someone whose life was similar to his, maybe worse: his mother was impregnated by his father when they were teenagers, they got married and went to live in his father's mother's house. from the start it wasn't a happy story; the teenage couple was way too young for a baby and used to live it up, leaving the baby with his grandmother. he grew up calling his parents by their first names, and his grandmother "mommy".  his grandmother disapproved greatly of his mother, and they clashed - often. his mother knew, however, that her MIL loved the baby like her own, and would use him as leverage, saying that if her MIL didn't do as she wanted, she'd take her son away. it came to a head, inevitably, one afternoon. as soap-opera-ish as this is going to sound, the argument escalated until it got physical; the boy's mother pushed his grandmother and she fell, hard, against a table. while the older woman was on the ground, crying and bleeding, the younger woman took her son and her things and left for her older sister's house. once there, she knocked on the door, left her son in her sister's arms, and took off for a friend's house.  her sister, at the time a newlywed, had no choice but to take the boy in. he was two years old at the time and so scared he couldn't talk, and there was no way to get in touch with his mother. the incident traumatized him so badly that for months after that, he would crawl out of bed in the dead of night, creep out to the stairs, and sit there for hours, crying for his grandmother.  that boy was my cousin. his mother is my aunt, and the older sister who took him in is my mother. his story is almost exactly like eminem's - at seventeen he was rapping, hoping to break into the local music scene - except for one thing. amazingly, my cousin never hated his mother. years later, when she went back to nursing school, he woke her up from a bad hangover on her graduation day, made her breakfast, helped her with her makeup, and patiently tailed her, carrying her graduation paraphernalia around at the hall while she went around greeting her friends.  i asked him once:  why don't you hate her? why aren't you angry at her for what she did to you?  because i was there for part of his childhood - we were superclose as children - and i remember his mother cursing at him and my mother shaking her, trying to get her to stop.  as a matter of fact,  i continued,  why don't you hate any of them?  he hadn't fared any better with my uncles; when my family left for thailand and my parents weren't around to protect him, my uncles would beat him up over the smallest things. once, when i was seven, we came back to the philippines for a vacation. my uncles pitted me against him in a reading "contest", and i won; i remember them jeering at him because he's four years older than i am. five minutes later one uncle grabbed him, dragged him out the back, and i could hear the slap of flesh against flesh, and my cousin crying.  i remember running out to the back and screaming  don't touch him, don't you touch him!  and another uncle pulling me back. when my mother came back home, i was literally shaking with anger, and told her what had happened. she went straight to my uncles, who were sitting in a corner playing chess, and told them, her voice hard:  i don't know how you treat him when i'm gone, but while i'm here, no one touches him. if i hear that you've hit him again, i swear to god i'm throwing you out of this house.   my cousin looked thoughtful for a while after i asked him that question, and then shrugged.  there would be no point in hating them,  he told me.  don't you see, rei? i'd end up exactly like them. and there's no point in hurting yet another generation, because if i were like them, i'd be beating up our nephew.   i saw eminem's  cleaning out my closet ; the snippet above is from his latest song,  lose yourself . i still don't like his music - not because it's too "real", but because it's too hopeless, too desperate. it's GOOD music - brutally honest and evocative of what eminem must have been feeling; you can almost smell the acridness of his sweat, see him trembling as he goes out on yet another stage, preparing to be booed off. you know his desperation, his motive: he's never been given an opportunity, he makes his own; and he gives his heart out at each performance because back home, he has a daughter to feed. he doesn't have an education, any training, any special skills, except rapping. this is all he has to put bread on his table, and if he screws up, more is on the line than just another bad night on the stage.  but it's hard to accept him as is, to watch him go out and rage night after night, single after single. it's hard to listen to him now because he's still at the hardest part of the journey, and i don't know if he's ever going to get to where my cousin is. i don't know if he wants to.  perhaps the scariest part of it all is that so many people identify with him.

      what a week it's been.   sunday, 17 november  i fell asleep at one AM and woke at hourly intervals, sweating and my heart beating too fast. at four AM i got up and walked around the apartment, opening all the doors and turning on all the lights; an hour later i went back to bed and slept straight on until six-thirty, when my father knocked on my door. he was leaving for bangkok on a 10AM flight and needed me to drive him to the ERL (express railway, an LRT that goes directly to the airport) station. i got up, pulled on a pair of jeans, and drove him there. he was unloading his luggage when i remembered.  happy birthday,  i said, leaning across the seat so that i could greet him face-to-face. he looked a little befuddled; he isn't any more of a morning person than i am.   thank you,  he said finally. the final piece of luggage unloaded, he waved goodbye and walked off, pulling his suitcases behind him. i watched him walk into the terminal and then drove home, where i slept until it was time to go to church for christmas practice.  my sister, C, and i were ready to go when her phone rang; one of her friends, Z, was running away from home and wanted to know if she could stay over for a week. we drove over to Z's area and found her hiding, crouched down with her bags behind a car three streets down from her house. she hopped into the back seat, C stage-whispered  keep your head down,  and we made our way back to church.  is it abduction if the abductee packs her bags and comes willingly into your car? i want to know.   monday, november 18  Z confessed that she'd never done any of the requisite crazy childhood things, like playing in the rain or climbing trees. shocked, C and i took her night-swimming in the rain to rectify the situation. later, when swimming lost its appeal, we got out of the water and out into the condo's driveway, where we danced like madwomen and did cartwheels in the puddles.  we ordered pizza for dinner, after which C got completely trashed on the remains of a bottle of vodka. Z and i ended up talking in the living room in hushed voices.  did she tell you why i'm running away?  Z asked, and i shrugged.   how about you tell me in person?  i suggested, and she did.   i want her to see me,  Z said.  she makes me feel like an annoying afterthought. i'm her daughter, for crying out loud. if she called me tonight, even if it were just to scream at me for doing something this stupid, i'd go home in five minutes flat.    you want her to care,  i guessed, and Z shrugged, looking strangely diminished.   i want her to love me,  she said,  but i'll take what i can get.    tuesday, november 19  came home from work to find Z and C madly cleaning house. my fears that they had been possessed by martha stewart were laid to rest when they explained things to me: a group of friends (all male, of course) were coming over for dinner, and they didn't want them coming across strange embarrassing things in the house.  we ordered pizza, the guys came over (or, to be more accurate, Z and i picked them up and drove them over because they're visitors and don't know their way around KL) and we ended up playing a whacked version of truth or consequence. much insanity occurred, mostly due to the fact that the guys are french and Z is malaysian and C and i are filipino, and cultural confusion was pretty much the theme of the night.   wednesday, november 20  i came home in a jubilant mood, having effectively tendered my resignation at work. my days are numbered; as of feb 1, 2003, i will be unemployed and minus one source of stress. another of my sister's friends was there, cooking dinner; i sat in the kitchen and watched them while i sipped on the remains of a bottle of red wine i found in the fridge. we had dinner and girltalk, and it was all very satisfyingly bachelorette-ish.  later that night, while i slept, C and Z went out and ended up in a gay bar. they were happy when they discovered it was a gay bar; previously, they'd been worried because they had been vamping all night and no one was paying attention. they came home, jumped fully clothed into the pool, decided that their clothes were too heavy, and skinny-dipped instead.   thursday, november 21  came home from work, went out clubbing with C and Z. it was ladies' night in the area we usually go to, so we wandered from place to place in search of good dance music. my sister and Z wound up arguing, and we eventually found ourselves in two different places - Z partying with other friends in nuovo, me watching disinterestedly as C got trashed on chivas regal in emporium. when it was time to go home, i discovered that my car keys had dropped out of my bag; my friend PA had to drive me home to pick up the spare set, while C slept off her drunk in the arms of PA's friends. on our way back to emporium, PA's friend called him and i picked up his phone; they'd found my car keys. we went back to emporium and PA's friends dragged my sister out; while i was supervising the logistics of getting her body into the car so i could drive us home, the door manager hit on me and offered to let me in free the next time i came.  you're so sweet,  i purred, because there was no sense in being impolite, and went off to get my car.  C woke up briefly while i was rolling her into bed.  i'm not drunk,  she said, her breath heavy with whisky.   sure you're not,  i replied.  that's why i just dragged you all the way from the car to your bed. i hope you feel like absolute hell tomorrow, you drunk.    friday, november 22  spent the day at work just trying to stay awake; at lunchtime i gave in to the inevitable and spent the entire hour at my desk, sleeping. PH told me later that our boss had come in, given me a strange look, then walked back out. not that i gave him reason to complain, because everything he wanted done that day was done, whether or not i had to pinch myself awake at the computer to do it.  and in between all of that i fell in love with KL, but that's another story.

      according to the regional DTI office in zamboanga, one of the region's top exports to malaysia includes fighting cocks. there's a whole host of risqué comments that could be made about that, but i'm feeling virtuous so i won't say anything.  speaking of unsavory exports: back in college, my friends and i did a report on the philippine legislative process, wherein we tracked the progress of a bill through congress and the senate. the bill we finally chose was a regulatory act on mail-order brides - for which, apparently, the philippines is renowned worldwide. there's no specific link for information on this, but when we did a simple yahoo search (this was back in 1998, i think), typing in the words "mail-order bride" produced tons of results, most of which advertised "pretty, obedient girls" from the philippines. there were a lot of ads for women from russia, too, but i don't think the tag "obedient" was attached to them.  at any rate, we sifted through endless pages of committee discussion minutes and session minutes and papers for the justification of the bill. there's one quote from a house member that stands out in my mind, whenever i remember that paper. frustrated by the length of time it was taking to discuss the bill and all the minutiae involved in legislative processes, he blurted out:  according to our statistics, our top exports are bananas, pineapples, and women. isn't the fact that our women are considered commodities justification enough for this bill?   the bill was passed eventually, although i forget the exact RA number. my memory is crap these days - i can’t even remember whether the bill outlawed the sourcing of mail-order brides, or just enforced stricter regulations on the industry. more likely the latter, since after all it IS a source of income. make no mistake, i hate the idea, but i understand the rationale. it’s the same rationale that squatters in the philippines use to justify their theft of public property - we’re poor, we can’t afford to have such high moral standards. my dad refers to it as the poverty mentality, and theorizes that unless people break out of that kind of thinking, they won’t be able to effect any sort of long-term positive change.  i actually met a mail-order bride once. i was in NAIA, waiting for the flight that would take me to KL for the Christmas holidays. being antisocial, i plunked myself down in an isolated stretch of seats, put my bag on the seat beside me, pulled out a book and started reading. since people generally don’t bug strangers who look like they’ve got something better to do, no one bothered me for quite a while. then a woman - thirtyish, with shoulder-length hair and a pretty, anxious face - sidled tentatively into a seat a few spaces down from mine. she sat down, fidgeting all the way; first it was her bag strap, then it was her hair, then she opened her bag and started taking out items and repacking them; finally, she left all of that alone and leaned back, rubbing her ticket with her thumbs and fingers.  at that point, i finished my book and put it away. i was fishing in my bag for another one (i always have at least three books handy whenever i travel) when the woman got up and moved nearer.  excuse me,  she said, smiling hesitantly.  what flight are you waiting for?    mh 704,  i said.  heading to kuala lumpur for the holidays. you?     i’m a transit passenger,  she said, grinning with shy pride and showing me her ticket.  this is my first flight. i’m going to germany.  there was a slight pause. i stared at her ticket wondering what i was supposed to say, and she rustled her ticket encouragingly.  i’m going to get married,  she added, when i failed to respond. probably guessing that i was lost for words, she hastily dug around in her bag and produced the ubiquitous bundle of pictures that most filipino females carry around in their wallets.  as she flipped through the pictures, looking for a snapshot of her sweetheart, she bubbled out her story: a friend of hers had been writing to a man from germany, she told me, and that man had a friend who was single. her friend’s boyfriend’s friend had gotten her contact details and written to her, and they had been corresponding for a year.  there,  she said proudly, bringing out a photograph.  doesn’t he look like jean-claude van damme?   i just blinked at her.  have you ever met up with this man before?  i asked, feeling infinitely older than she was.  or have you just been communicating through mail?   she looked at me, uncertain, then turned back to the photograph, rubbing it gently with her thumb.  we wrote each other,  she explained.  he was very nice. last year he came to the philippines for two weeks to help me get a fiancé visa to germany.  there was a short pause, and she added,  he was kind to my parents.    he sounds good,  i said cautiously.  but are you sure? do you know anybody else in germany?   she shook her head, returning the photograph to her wallet, and her hands trembled a little.  just him,  she admitted.  he says he’ll meet me at the airport. and we’ll get married.   i didn’t quite know what to say, after that. there was an awkward pause before they opened up the gate and they started letting passengers board our flight. i didn’t see her after that, but i thought about her all the way to KL, and told my mother about her that night.  how can she do that?  i asked, confused.  stake her life and her future on maybes? this guy could be abusive, or sell her, or use her as a slave, or whatever, and he’s the only person she knows in germany. how can she take chances like that?   my mother shrugged.  she probably doesn’t think she has a choice,  she said, and told me about what life had been like for her as a girl, in a village where they had to ford streams and hike across mountains in bare feet just to get to school, where the children were given a holiday when a jeep came into town because no one had ever seen an automobile before, not even the teachers.  sometimes,  my mother explained,  you just want to get out so badly that you don’t think too hard about what you’re doing to get out, or what you’re going to do after you get out.    i don’t understand that kind of desperation,  i told her.   you’ve never been there,  she answered.   i guess that’s what motivates most of them - the mail-order brides and the domestic helpers and the women we refer to as  japayukis  and  brunei beauties  - the desperate need to get out of that rut you’re stuck in. in  anak , vilma santos asked her friend,  the first time we leave, it’s because of the money. the second time, the third time … it’s pretty much still about finances. we need the money, so we go and look for work somewhere else. but what about the fifth time, the sixth time? is it still money that motivates us?  implying that in a sense, they weren’t leaving just to make money; they were leaving because they were running away, escaping a life in the philippines that was too difficult for them to accept or deal with.   there’s something incredibly strange and twisted and sad about a country that puts on a stoic face and accepts the barter of its women as an economic necessity. yaz and i used to write each other fast and furiously, indignant at the way Filipino women were viewed as toys or pets or slaves in different parts of the world. but when you think about it - in a way  (in a way)  it’s partly our fault, too. not that it justifies the way people mistreat our women, but then - can you really blame them, when we turn a blind eye to the way they sell themselves because we need the money? someone once told me that i couldn’t expect people to respect me unless i respected myself, and it’s becoming clear that the same thing applies to countries and nationalities as well.

      dear M,  i love you.  do you know why i started my letter out that way? let me tell you, before you start filling out my application forms for UP sappho (which i am not eligible for anymore, at any rate, since i am no longer a UP student): because only for someone i love would i download over 400KB of useless forwards. M! did you not get the memo? dancing pigs and brad pitt's unmentionables are NOT acceptable forwards! (the dancing pigs were cute, but brad pitt ... oy. i'm traumatized for life, M, how could you.)   i shall be forgiving, however, and chalk it down to the fact that you have not yet found the pork chop that you will eventually share your life with and therefore have too much time on your hands. don't worry, i haven't found my african fish, or my tree yet, either. we will someday, i suppose. in the meantime, there are many many alternative pork chops on the loose for you, and i am haplessly falling in love with various and sundry trees and giving my heart to none. we're young, M, we have time to dally. when we get too old to open beer bottles with our teeth, then perhaps it will be time to panic ... but not yet. not ever near yet.  speaking of fish and trees and pork chops and destinies, i see that A has found hers. or, more accurately, it has found her: only a man who could order A to sit HERE and get away alive, deserves her - such strength of character, such bravery and derring-do, such utter recklessness, must be properly rewarded. i laughed until tears ran at your description of their love affair:  worthy of a dime novel,  you said, and i believe you.   at any rate, i suppose this is the grandiosely stupid thing she e-mailed us all about months back? she sounded slightly dazed back then, stunned and upset and knocked out of her common senses, and come to think of it, it did cross my mind that she might have fallen in love. A is the queen of control freaks, no matter how helpless she may try to appear at times. and love, no matter what you think about it, is one of the things that makes things spin out of control until you can manage to catch your breath again and step back a little. the first few seconds of free-falling are always scary.  i'll do as you told me and stalk her endlessly until she gives up and tells me the whole story. while i'm waiting, though, i want to ask you: what about YOU, M? only you, of all my friends, would write me pages and pages of letter and never mention herself. all the news is lovely and more than welcome, you know that, but ... A and V and the lives of the other members of our group aside, what's going on with you? where have you been hanging out? who rocks your world (aside from avril lavigne, eewww, M)? have you made friends with any new cars, and have you seen joseph around lately? if you have, kiss his fender for me, because i miss him dreadfully. there are joseph-shaped voids in me, M, and every time i drive with the wind in my hair i have the sense-memory of his steering wheel between my fingers, his reluctant clutch beneath my demanding foot. if cars could dream, he dreams of us, and i'm sure he treasures the marks we left behind: the oil and sweat from your hands as my reckless driving slapped you hard against the dash, the holes burned in his upholstery by bitter cigarettes, the crumbs of potato chips ground into the floor.  and even more than i miss joseph, i miss A, and i miss V, and i miss you. i never think of manila that i don't remember us balancing on the rooftops of intramuros, or being bitter along manila bay, or going the wrong way down those godforsaken one-way streets. i never see water, or rivers, that i don't remember driving through marikina late at night, with the concrete glistening from rain and the reflection of street lamps, and talking of things that needed darkness to be told. i miss the time V and i kidnapped you from your quiet night at home to drag you, clad in jeans and a t-shirt, to our org's formal sit-down dinner. you sat down next to karlo, i think, elegant and comfortable in your casual clothes, while V and i, formally-clad, attacked the buffet table with all the finesse of wild animals.  and i remember that you never talked about yourself much. you used to allow us to prattle on and on, filling aeons with our useless chatter. i was particularly guilty, ambushing you at odd moments to cry on your shoulder over some new trauma, and you listened. M, you will never know how glad i am that you gave up your dream of becoming a nun (even a carmelite one because you liked how they lived in the scent of flowers) because there was too much silence inside you to bear that much stillness outside. maybe in some strange way our noisiness balanced you, but M, i wish you'd spoken more. in those short flashes of time when you told me your stories, when you were vulnerable, when you cried - i felt more your friend than in all the times i came running to you and expected you to pick me up.  i have a penchant for saying the most horribly inappropriate things at the worst times, but M, sometimes i have to ask these things. are you still convinced that you're not enough? does that part of your past still make you feel as if you don't deserve to be loved? of course we told each other that they were all wrong, that no matter what anyone once told us when we were too small to defend ourselves, we were indeed worth it. but it takes longer to convince the heart, doesn't it? i know you were never comfortable with loving, not the way V and i were - but then again, perhaps V and i aren't very good examples, since we're shameless. and i know you never thought you were beautiful, and that you thought we were all lying through our teeth when we said you were, but M, you are. cross my heart, honest to goodness, you are.  the thing is, i'm kind of afraid that you've given up on things like falling in love and being happy, but M, you really shouldn't. you sounded so happy for A - but don't you remember what she had to go through first? it's not like there are instant happy endings, M; and if there are no happily-ever-afters, it stands to reason that happiness is not a one-shot deal either. you sound like you're settling for second-hand happiness - as if you believe you'll be happy as long as each and every one of us is happy, but oh no, M, you're not getting off that easy. no. i won't let you; you MUST have your own share, and i insist - i will absolutely kick your butt if i must, just to get you to go and  carpe  each  diem  to your own satisfaction.  M, you always believed so strongly that we'd each have our good life, above and beyond the aristotelian ideals described in our philosophy books. i want you to believe again - for yourself, and not just for me, or for A, or for V. we're going to find our own ways, M, never worry. it's time for you to find your own.  you WILL find your perfect pork chop one day, be it man or situation or career or whatever, and you will deserve it with every cell in your being. and in the meantime, you don't need that destiny to complete you, because you are complete. holes and warts and jagged places included, M, believe me. i told you once that sometimes i thought i'd been given the childhood i'd had to toughen me up, because without it i would be spineless and afraid all the time, not just some of the time. you've got to learn the same - that everything you've been through, all the wrongs and the rights - they come together to form the you that is today. not that i'm excusing the wrongs, or validating them, because wrong is wrong, but - you can choose to reject the bad parts, to say  i will use you to make myself stronger, so there, i still win!   and even if you don't find it, M, the journey's worth it.  before you ask, i'm fine. and no, i haven't found my tree yet. or perhaps i've found it, but there's just too much foresty goodness surrounding me to concentrate on one tree, so my tree will have to wait. but yes, i keep myself open to hope and possibilities - and so should you. remember, M.  to joseph and tweezers and cheesy tagalog movies,  rei - who would like to remind you of that cruel tree in the lagoon that she loved hopelessly for years, simply because it was what it was. (you are what you are, M, and if i could love a heartless tree, you can imagine how infinitely more plausible it is that you will find someone who will love you because of that.)

      it's been raining hard in KL lately, and it's been ramadan for a week. not that the two are related, although i must say - if i had to fast, i'd much rather fast in a climate that was cool and fresh than one that was hot and steamy. past ramadans in KL have felt as if heaven was trying to melt us down into puddles on the sidewalk, and it must have been miserable for those who were fasting.  ramadan is an exercise in humility, as i understand it - a month wherein all muslims fast to understand what it is like to be poor and hungry, and thus learn to have compassion on their fellow men. when they say "fast", though, they mean it: none of the lenten no meat for a month kind of deprivation. from sunrise to sunset, they neither eat nor drink (not even to swallow their own saliva), do not partake in any vices, and strive to keep mind and body pure.  the fun part of ramadan is  buka puasa , the malay term for breaking fast. not just because of the patently obvious, but because  buka puasa  has come to mean family time. families that normally miss each other due to busy schedules now find time to come home and break fast together. friends make it an excuse to catch up with one another:  let's  buka puasa  together later.  eating becomes more enjoyable, more precious - not just because it is something you have forgone all day, but because it becomes an event in and of itself, something anticipated and planned for and celebrated when it happens.  the month-long fasting ends with  eid-il-fitr , which is when everybody goes  balik kampung  - back to their home towns - to celebrate  hari raya , which is their equivalent of new year's day. another time i'll explain the malaysian concept of new year's day - the malays, chinese and indians celebrate it separately, but with very similar and very lovely traditions.  this is true islam, i think, which is why malaysia gets so defensive when it gets labelled a terrorist country. you'd have to come here to understand, but KL is gentle and innocent in a way that you would not believe a major city could be. where else in the world could you hold open house and not have your home stripped of its belongings within five seconds flat? (aside from the boonies where everybody knows everybody, natch.)

      this is  not  the report i eventually submitted to my boss. this was my take on it, and i'm posting it here for fun.  all names have been changed to protect the moronic and extremely annoying.  - - -   POST - ACTIVITY REPORT  TITLE : PHILIIPPINE BOOTH AT TE 2002 DURATION : Sometime in October 2002 VENUE : ABC Exhibition Center, Selangor    I. Introduction   There was an exhibition. We participated. Not much more to it, really.  Oh, yes. This exhibition had live animals and food, and had we had time we might actually have had a chance to go around and snack. But we didn’t, more’s the pity. We were actually looking forward to breaking our diets, for once.   II. Highlights    Preparation  The Philippine booths at the TE 2002 were offered on a complimentary basis by the organizer of the event, XYZ Sdn. Bhd, which was probably the only reason why there WAS a Philippine booth in the first place. If the Department of Trade and Industry is perpetually lacking for funds, suffice it to say that the Department of Agriculture, apparently, is completely bereft. I mean, if you can’t make money through wheeling and dealing, who said you could make it grubbing around in dirt with fruits and vegetables? Take note: this comes from the granddaughter of a farmer. I know whereof I speak.  Information on the event and possible participation was forwarded to the Department of Agriculture for consideration. After much agonizing (oh dear god, we’re going to have to SPEND MONEY on air tickets!), they decided that the debilitating pain of expenditure would just have to be outweighed by the off chance that people just might be interested in Philippine products and buy them, offsetting the money they’d laid out. One of the departments in the DA coordinated Philippine participation, which eventually consisted of two - count ‘em, TWO! - people. Assistant Director JOSN of DA - a short, rotund man who looked like Santa Claus with a mother of a tan - headed the Philippine Delegation, such as it was.  The DA provided promotional and decorative materials, product samples and display items, with supplementary promotional posters sourced from CITEM. Mr. RC, the participant from the private sector, brought product samples and catalogues from his company. The original box of promotional / decorative materials was stolen at the ABC Exhibition Center because the trade assistant (oh I wonder WHO it could have been, [/sarcasm]) went temporarily insane and left it behind to look for a trolley. That’ll teach us all to believe in the inner goodness of mankind. PTIC-KL then provided brochures, pamphlets, and decorative material for the booth, because otherwise it would have been as barren as the Sahara Desert and twice as ugly.   Philippine Booth (Booths No. 525 & 532)  There were ten million eighty-six booths there, and our booth was one of the most interesting. Well, no - “most interesting” would have had to go to the booths with carved wooden gargoyles, or the big-ass Ministry of Health booth with the light-and-sound show, but hey, you take what you can get. Our booth could have carried off “Most Artistic”, though. Minimalist with a splash of opulent red-and-gold sinamay, with rotting fruits nestled daintily in between brochures of the Philippines and Mindanao hand-woven silk.  Oh, sorry, forgot: we mustn’t mention that the fruits were rotting. Because if you didn’t look too closely, they really didn’t look like they were. Honest.  A lot of people visited the booth, although whether it was due to the kick-ass, last-minute decoration job or the fact that we were giving out free samples of food is a matter of pure conjecture. Considering the fact that we have already posited the absolute loss of our belief in the innate goodness of humankind, most likely the latter - because despite what Maslowe thinks, people who can afford to eat three times a day and satisfy all of their basic needs still tend to go mad at the sight of free stuff. Is it the Darwinian need to survive in a harsh world, or are we all just innately cheapskates?  We’ll leave that to the anthropologists and genetic scientists to figure out.   Decoration  Papayas that were mushy at the ends, mangoes that had been slightly bashed by the trauma of being transported across the ocean, mangosteens that had no identifying marks or characteristics to differentiate them from Malaysian mangosteens (which are, after all, the exact same species). A booth held together with tape and a prayer, various posters that depicted artificially delicious-looking fruits and vegetables (bet you didn’t know asparagus could look that luscious) and odd kinds of seafood. Apparently the Philippines produces black shrimp nowadays, isn’t that amazing?  It sounds bad, but it actually looked okay. I’m not just saying this because I’m one of the interior decorating team.   III. Incoming Inquiries   There were inquiries?    IV. Overall Assessment   I have nothing to say except next time, there damn well better be FUNDS for transport and all the small logistical details. We’re human beings, people, not Irona the robot with super-strength and rechargeable batteries.   - - -  for this, i got my bachelor's in political science and slaved through my MBA.  life sucks sometimes.

      to those who don't know narnia: read the backgrounder first. to those who do know, and remember it as a semi-dark fairytale but don't want to take it farther than the happy ending, you might not want to read my recs.  the backgrounder:  urlLink narnia  is an alternate universe, one filled with mythical creatures and talking animals and Magic. one day it crosses over with the real world: a girl named lucy, taking an enforced summer vacation in the backwoods of nowhere with an absent-minded professor and her three older siblings, steps into a wardrobe to breathe in the smell of stored fur coats, and comes out the other end into another world.  at first the world is beautiful, ice-cold and pure white. she runs into mr. tumnus, a faun, who takes her home and gives her tea and sandwiches. they talk and talk and talk, and in the end lucy realizes that hours have passed and she must return to her world, because her brothers and sister will be worried. she goes back through the wardrobe and realizes that no one has missed her. time moves differently in these two worlds, and the hours she has spent in narnia translate into mere moments in her world.  the second time she goes in, narnia lifts the veil to show its dark side: mr. tumnus is gone, arrested by the white witch, an evil queen-wannabe who has put narnia under an eternal winter. lucy learns that he has most likely been taken as a result of her visit: she has spies everywhere, whispers mrs. beaver who is, you guessed it, a talking beaver.  meanwhile, lucy's brother, edmund, has also discovered narnia. however, instead of meeting a good guy, he runs into the Purveyor of All Evil in narnia: the white witch. she terrifies edmund until he confesses that he came from another world, whereupon she turns around and begins to seduce him with turkish delight and promises of co-rulership over narnia.  tell me about yourself,  she says, and he does: about his school, about how miserable his school vacations are, about his sisters and his brother. she is particularly interested in his siblings, and proposes that he bring them over to her castle for tea.  edmund and lucy return to the wardrobe at the same time; lucy is overjoyed to see that edmund has visited narnia. the last time she told her siblings about narnia, they thought she was making things up, as she is prone to playing games of make-believe.  now they'll have to believe us,  she tells him, referring to their skeptical older siblings, peter and susan. however, edmund betrays her, a foreshadowing of things to come: he tells peter and susan that it was just a game he was playing with lucy, and he hadn't expected her to take it quite so seriously. lucy runs off in tears, and peter turns on edmund, chastising him for being so harsh on their youngest sister.  eventually, all four of them make it into narnia, whereupon edmund inadvertently reveals that he has indeed been to narnia before. peter tells him off for lying, and the seeds of resentment are planted: edmund decides that when he goes to see the white witch, he won't bring peter, since the white witch promised to make them all princes and princesses, and peter doesn't deserve to be a prince. lucy leads them to the beavers' house, and over a dinner of fish (naturally), mr. beaver reveals the reason behind the white witch's interest in the four of them.  in narnia, he says, there is a prophecy: the white witch will rule until adam's flesh and adam's bone - two sons of adam and two daughters of eve - bring back aslan, who will break her rule and end the eternal winter. at this point, edmund - who realizes that his alliance with the white witch might not be viewed in a positive light by his brother and sisters (who are already quite put out with him) - slips out to secretly meet her.  eventually the four siblings are reunited and narnia is saved with the help of the mysterious aslan, who turns out to be narnia's creator in the form of a huge lion. the four go on to rule narnia in what will be known in its history as the golden age, with King Peter the Wise and Queen Susan the Beautiful and King Edmund the Just and Queen Lucy the Kind-Hearted. one day the kings and the queens are out hunting, and stumble across a wood; dismounting, they explore it and find an eerie light that seems to come from nowhere.  exploring it further, they suddenly fall through and find themselves back in their old world - in a pile of fur coats in the back of a wardrobe. they have all returned to the ages they once were.  the book ends ambiguously: like the characters, you are unable to decide whether the entire thing was a psychotic episode, or for real.  i received the entire narnia series as a birthday present on my ninth birthday, and read through them in a week. on the surface they were nothing more than moralistic fairy tales, something like a modern-day pilgrim's progress, which is most likely why my mother bought them for me. but they haunted me the way grimms' fairy tales did (with undercurrents of something terrible in between the once-upon-a-time and the happily-ever-after), and i used to return to them, trying to figure out what disturbed me.  in COL, teacher anna made us read a retelling of snow white and rose red -  because fairy tales aren't for children,  she said,  not really.  there was death there, and manipulative mothers, and slavery. in the original red riding hood, the girl was raped and there was no woodsman to save her.  and with that class, many of the things i'd thought about and felt and sensed, crawling beneath the pretty pictures, were given a name. they weren't pretty names, but they were names nonetheless, and i stopped being afraid of red glowing eyes in the dark because now i knew who they were.  the same feeling of recognition seeps through in these fics. there are two of them:  urlLink the queen in exile  and  urlLink girls grow quicker than books , which both deal with the aftermath of returning. how does a mind deal with the expansion and shrinkage of time, and the crossover and interlapping of lives lived? if you've read the entire series, the latter fic has a small tie-in to susan's eventual exile from narnia.  the moral of the story being: there are no fairy tales, not the way people think there are.

       urlLink  deepavali  : the festival of lights, a celebration of the triumph of good over evil. technically it's a hindu festival, but it's considered one of the major public holidays in malaysia. one good thing about a multi-racial society: lots of holidays. november to february is generally considered holiday time, since all the major holidays fall on or around that time - deepavali, christmas, hari raya (or  eid-il-fitr ), and chinese new year.  but wait, we were talking about deepavali. in malaysia there are two things that symbolize deepavali - first, the lamps, obviously, since it is a festival of lights. on the eve of deepavali, lamps are lit at the doorways and pathways of hindu homes and kept burning all night; hindu belief has it that these lamps are meant as a welcome to whichever deity you wish to visit you. (and as an aside: yaz, laya, i don't know if you remember, but krishna's second name is actually the name of the hindu goddess of prosperity. if you knew this before, be kind because i only found out about this now.)  the second thing is the  kolam  - a design drawn on the ground or the floor with colored rice. it's an amazing thing, actually, since the design is usually quite intricate - the link says "floral", but it actually varies widely. last year there was a  kolam  at the KLCC - a mall near my workplace - that was the size of several rooms. it took an entire classroomfull of students from malaysia's premier art university - the lim kok wing institute - several days to complete it, but it was gorgeous. i took pictures, but i have yet to send them to laya and yaz like i promised.  speaking of the  kolam , i read something about them a long time ago. i'm not sure if it's true, but boy, if it is ... at any rate, if i recall correctly: traditionally, the woman of the house is responsible for creating and forming the  kolam  at the threshold of her home. every evening, she sweeps it away, and the next morning she gets up and - get this - MAKES A NEW ONE. according to the thing i read, this practice was supposed to enhance the virtues of patience and acceptance, and may i just say that you've got to be darn patient to do something like that every. single. day.  there's also another deepavali practice in malaysia: the open house. all malaysians, at one time or another, hold an open house - hindus at deepavali, christians at christmas, muslims during hari raya, and the chinese during chinese new year. this is the amazing thing - open house means, quite literally, that their house is open to everyone. strangers are welcomed in and offered food and drinks and hospitality; this is practiced all over malaysia, from the most rural of villages to the urban center of kuala lumpur. even more amazing is that people are generally respectful of the houses they enter; i don't think i've heard of any cases where people who had an open house were stolen from.  i don't think we have an equivalent in the philippines. the closest i can think of is  noche buena , but then again, your house isn't really open to everybody - just to friends and family. that, and nobody's really up for visiting anybody except friends and family on  noche buena , since it's considered to be a family occasion.  and then again, just imagine open house in the philippines. your house would be stripped before you could say  merry christmas .

      i've been foolish, these past few weeks. partially because the last couple of weeks have almost literally been hell: the hostage-taking in moscow, the sniper shootings in washington, the bomb blast in bali, and the tension over iraq; partially because my own life was sucking, different parts of it in varying degrees of suckiness.  then there were the aftershocks: demonstrations and rallies in jakarta, because abu bakar's followers think that his being placed under police custody is a matter of indonesian democracy being steamrolled by western prejudices; a picture of a man standing at the bomb blast site in bali, his hand over his mouth and tears in his eyes because his 18-year-old daughter had died there; and then bomb threats upon bomb threats upon bomb threats, until you get tired of being afraid of them and start thinking  if you're going to bomb us then DO it already, dammit, because this wondering and cowering is driving me mad.   although i'm not quite sure that i didn't go a little mad, anyway. my inner control freak didn't want the world to go to pieces like this, not without some sort of explanation, and i wanted so badly for things to make sense. but some things defy consolidation, or rationalization. there are some things that you can't tidy up, or sweep around, or rearrange, and that's only right because they are what they are. in the end i had to stop being stupid and selfish, stop trying to make things sensible and sane, and just sit back and let them be. how did i put it once? not to internalize the pain, because it wasn't my pain; but to acknowledge it, to sympathize, and to look for ways to help.  at the same time, i had to realize that the flip side applied as well; when it IS indeed my pain, then i have to hurt for it. i can't put it aside, or hide from it, or redirect it. and i certainly can't create a persona to gatekeep my memories, to validate ones that had slipped beyond my reach and to stand as a buffer between me and things that i chose not to remember. it sounds strange and psychotic, yes, but well, the things you do to deal with things that still have the power to make you break out into a cold sweat in an air-conditioned room, years after they happened. G and i were talking about it once, when we were discussing the shadier parts of our pasts, and came to the general conclusion that at the end of the day, you've got to do the things that keep you from cracking up and becoming the same monster that used to terrorize you.   so. like i tried to tell luis (but failed miserably because coherence does not figure largely in our correspondence),  these people may let hatred lead them around by the nose, but i'll be damned if i let their hatred and anger influence the way i lead my life.  that includes bomb threats, which we were discussing with much heat and incoherent frustration. and if i feel that way about global hatred and fear, then it would be hypocritical of me to not apply the same philosophy to anger and fear that is as close as my own bloodline, yes?  so, no more hiding. no more hoffe, and even though he may be an invented persona, he's my invented persona, so i had to write him and tell him that he would need to step away for a while. no more asking for things to make sense, or trying to force them to fit into little compartments for me, just so i can sleep easy at the end of the day.  it doesn't solve anything, to be honest. you've still got a world where a 17-year-old survivor of the moscow hostage-taking has no words for what he feels except  urlLink  everything is perfect. i'm alive  . and you've got tim o'brien explaining  urlLink what goes on in the mind of a war veteran , which isn't very comforting. but if i can't make sense of it then it's only right and fair, because if killing ever made sense then the world would definitely be wrong. and as my personal life goes, there are still things that i won't be able to do, just yet, because just thinking about confronting certain people still makes my throat close up - but that's fine. i won't rush.  in the meantime, i'm taking out all the things i put away, in my mad and useless quest to control what i couldn't. like i told hoffe:  it's strange: i thought growing up meant leaving behind the things of before, but - in my case, at least - it looks as if growing up means i'll have to learn how to take them with me.

      i didn't find any newater in singapore; i'm disappointed. good golly, it's practically the national water, and they didn't have it anywhere. for shame. memorable moments in singapore:  > snarking at all the thin, fashionably-dressed girls who strolled the streets, mocking us with their beauty. C moaned  i swear, they all go to marie-france, they have the same bodies,  and i said  no, they just don't eat as much as we do.  because we ate. a lot.  > borders and kinokuniya, my personal meccas. i am drawn to bookstores like a moth to a flame, with much less fatal results. of course i bought lots and lots of books, one of them being  the science of God  by gerald schroeder - a look at physics and biochemistry and paleontology and various other scientists through the eyes of one who believes that all things were created by a divine Creator. next up:  a brief history of time  by stephen hawking, who claims to have the final proof that God does not exist. while i believe, irrevocably, that God IS, ever was and ever will be despite what anybody says, does or believes, it's interesting to look at the argument from both sides and weigh them using pure logic, and see if logic and faith lead to the same ultimate conclusion. don't you think?  > getting lost, endless times, in the underpasses and confuzzling mazes of streets that are the orchard road junctions with all other streets in singapore's shopping area. i finally fixed, as my points of reference, borders and kinokuniya - since they were the only places i could find without getting hopelessly confused.  > butterflies landing on my mother's hair, an anteater that ignored us in its search for food, a couple of mouse deer resting quietly under a big leaf, revealed only when my father brushed it aside, and a lazy, arrogant monkey that lay flat on its back and surveyed us through indifferent eyes as we did all sorts of antics just to get it to react.  you arrogant primate,  i huffed.  YOU'RE the monkey in the zoo! do something!  whereupon it seemed to raise an eyebrow at me and say  but my dear, YOU'RE the one jumping around like a trained moron.  these all took place in the singapore zoological gardens, which has - according to the taped commentary - 1,290 animals in its enclosures. is that including the human animals, i wonder?  > using the male bathroom in wheelock place by honest mistake. i wandered in, bold as you please, used the bathroom, then left the stall to wash my hands ... and froze in my tracks, because there was a guy to my left standing at a urinal. instinct kicked in while my logic was still stuttering for an explanation (because i'd been so SURE that i'd gone into the female bathroom), and i exited quickly before he turned around; luckily his back was to me or i would have seen a lot more of singapore than i actually wanted to. i told my mother about it and she went off into absolute fits of laughter.  mother,  i said indignantly.  you're supposed to be concerned for my virtue.  she just looked at me and started howling again, so i suppose my virtue isn't a very big issue with her. i ask you.  i had stories to tell that i can't remember now, so i suppose they'll have to be told another day. in the meantime, happy new year's, everybody. may you all have many hours spent in the company of people you feel comfortable with or enlightened by, many moments of humor and whimsy and delight, and many many people and objects and situations that will leave you wordless with the beauty and wonder of them. there are hard times, yes, but you never really actually SEE the good things unless you've had to bleed for them, so it all works out.  and we'll do this all over again next next year. cheers!

      i'm sure you've all been there: the really really REALLY bad date that made you swear off social outings for a few weeks; the one that you endured rather than enjoyed; the one that had you rolling your eyes, glancing pointedly at your watch, yawning - ANYTHING to offend the son-of-a-mangy-cow so much that he would cut the date off prematurely.  well, it wasn't my date, technically; it was my friend D's date, but since i was her buffer, i couldn't leave. it was worse than a roadside accident; at least those give you the option to look away, to not carry away memories. this date - oy, it sticks like grease to the corners of my mind.  the evening started out ordinarily enough. my sister went off to her job - a night shift waitressing at a club. D called up to ask if i was going out, since she was going out with her sister and a friend from school. i'd been planning to go clubbing anyway - my sister works at the club that we usually hang out at, and i try to go once a week to see her and cheer her up if she's cranky - but was happy to know that i'd have company.  D and i met up, early enough for me to avoid the sleazy door manager at one of the clubs. she introduced me to her sister, who was so beautiful that for five seconds, i just stared; dressed elegantly in black, and with her hair loosely twisted up, she looked like a manga drawing come to life. D is pretty too, but in a cutish sort of way - more like a refined kewpie doll. after a while, RZ - D's friend from school - showed up, and we gathered uncertainly at a neighboring bar. the night was still young, the music kind of sucked, and none of us really knew where we wanted to hang out yet. that, and we looked like an odd bunch. D's sister ML and RZ were elegant in black outfits; D and i were ultra-casual, both wearing white tank tops - although D had paired hers with jeans and i was wearing a sarong.  a few minutes after RZ arrived, her boyfriend AD showed up. now, RZ is pretty, exceptionally so that night since she was all dressed up; her boyfriend, in contrast, looked like the Missing Link and had a matching personality. even worse, he clung like a limpet to RZ, and at one point i caught his hand wandering down toward RZ's butt. later, ML leaned toward me and D and hissed,  is he going to die if he doesn't touch her? because he hasn't let go ONCE during this entire evening!   and D and i just shrugged; being single (ML was there with her boyfriend, too), we chose to remain silent for fear of being accused of sour-graping. we left the bar for the club upstairs, hoping that they had better music. unfortunately, they didn't.  after lame attempts at dancing, during which RZ tried to freak-dance her boyfriend and he stood there with a confused expression on his face, we gave up and returned to the bar downstairs. this time it was, as destiny's child would say, jumping, and they were playing danceable music. ML got an uncomfortable expression on her face; apparently, she doesn't like crowds. when RZ and her boyfriend excused themselves to go home, ML grabbed the chance to say that she wanted to leave, too. D and i bid them goodbye, then - as soon as they were out of hearing range - looked at each other and squealed. we're kindred spirits when it comes to clubbing; we go to clubs to dance, we like the same kind of dance music, and we love crowded dance floors.  we had about three hours to ourselves before D's phone beeped. it was a guy we'd met at the club last week; they'd swapped phone numbers and agreed to meet up again sometime. he was at a nearby club, and wanted to meet up with her. we went out to meet him, which was made slightly difficult by the fact that he kept on moving around.  where are you?  D asked him on her phone, while scanning the area.   i'm the one dressed in black,  he answered.   we're at a club,  D said, exasperated.  everybody and his country cousin is dressed in black.   we finally found him, and i raised my eyebrow approvingly at D.  he's cute,  i whispered. i hadn't seen him properly last week, as i'd been busy talking to someone else.  we went inside to dance, and that was where the evening began its downhill slide. he was a terrible dancer - arms and legs all over the place; he actually nearly hit a woman who was dancing behind him - and even worse, seemed happily oblivious to that fact.  these people suck,  he said loudly to D, waving his hand to encompass the entire dance floor.  i'm better! i'm the best dancer in the world!   D grimaced at me, i moved away a little to try to disassociate myself from her crazy date, and ended up brushing my hand against someone's lighted cigarette. ten minutes later, D tapped my shoulder and motioned toward the door, and i nodded gratefully.  we headed to a nearby café to have a drink, and that was where the night became irretrievably bad. rashid "call me richard", aka D's date, took the opportunity to enlighten us on his opinions on life, the world, and society in general. we soon wondered why he bothered at all, since his worldview could have been summed up in four words: "i don't like it". he didn't like blacks, he didn't like whites, he didn't like chinese, he didn't like indians, he didn't like malays, he didn't like malaysians or malaysia in general, he didn't like schoolchildren or old people, he didn't like the way some of the women at the club dressed, he didn't like the way the man at the neighboring table dressed.  to add insult to injury, rashid kept on forgetting my name.  what's your name?  he asked, for the fifth time, and i repeated it through gritted teeth. D, to my right, was pretending to fall asleep - she actually put her head down on the table - and we had both ceased to regard him as a part of the conversation. he was not one to take a hint, however, and insisted on staying with us until 4AM. when he finally departed, rashid turned to me and said  goodbye. and your name is rei.    very good,  i replied, my voice dripping with sweetness.  goodbye,  wretched,  have a nice trip home.  beside me, D cupped her hand over her mouth to keep from giggling. when the car door closed behind him, D and i screamed with relief.  my sister's shift ended at about 4:30; we were sitting around talking and waiting for my mom to pick us up when another man walked up.  excuse me,  he said, his voice heavy and accented.  do you believe in fate?   after we confirmed that he had, indeed, said "fate" and not "faith", he continued. he had been in a car with friends, he said, when he had seen the three of us talking. something had struck him, had moved inside him, and he had felt compelled to come to us, to introduce himself. he had no bad intentions, he only wanted to be friends, he wanted to know if he would ever see us again.   um,  my sister said, after a brief second of silence during which the three of us merely stood there looking at him, trying desperately not to laugh.  i work here, and my friends usually hang out here, so if you ever come here again, seeing us is pretty much a given.    but may i not contact you?  he asked.  i will be leaving for portugal for christmas, and i will return only next year.    okay,  i said.  just come to the entrance bar and tell them you're looking for rei. they'll pass the message on to me.   he produced a pen, and asked me how i spelled my name; when i did, his face lit up.  rei!  he said excitedly.  do you know what this means in my language?   i had an idea, thanks to the fruitcake discussion inspired by  urlLink SOMEONE  who shall remain unnamed, but gave him a wary glance anyway.  if it means something obscene or unimaginably horrible, i said primly, i'd really rather not know.    it means king!  he told me, and i grinned, taking it as a portent: i am destined to rule the universe. or a smaller, albeit significant part of it, at any rate.  again, we waited until he was out of hearing range before bursting into wild howls of laughter.  first it was wretched and his 'i hate everything but you', and now it's this nut with babblings of destiny,  i said.  whatever happened to 'hello, my name is X, may i buy you a drink'? must all pick-up lines be indescribably bizarre? is it them, or us?   and then again, clubbing in KL is surreal, so maybe that's it.

      as per yaz's request and for  urlLink your  edification (feel the love, G?), i'll try to recount what goes on during philippine new year's. i'm not sure i've got everything down pat, since my family has a tendency to take philippine traditional practices and warp them to taste, but i'm sure yaz and laya will chip in to fill in the details. so.  new year's in the philippines starts two days before, since december 30 is bonifacio day - the birthday, i think, of andres bonifacio, one of our national heroes. (although i'm not quite sure what he's a hero for, if the current debates are to be believed.) since it's a national holiday, people are out and about, celebrating both the tail end of christmas (because christmas lasts for about three months in the philippines) and the oncoming new year. there is, of course, an abundance of food and drink - no celebration in asia is complete without everyone going home at least five pounds heavier - an oversupply of sparkly stuff and assorted pyrotechnics, and endless radio countdowns.  on new year's eve, the pyrotechnics start as soon as twilight starts settling in. they would start sooner except for the fact that sunlight dilutes or completely erases the effect of fireworks, and part of the point of setting off fireworks, of course, is to show your neighbors how wealthy you are. your social status can be determined from the type of pyrotechnics you set off for new year's: the poor, or the ultra-cheap, stick to puny little watusi (tiny little matchstick-things that you scrape against the ground until they start crackling and dancing) and sparklers; the more affluent will have long strands of firecrackers and catherine wheels. the ritzy, or those who are willing to forego a year's worth of food for one night's worth of fireworks, go all out and hire professional fireworks experts (or whatever they're called) to set off massive pyrotechnical displays above their house.  all of this happens, of course, despite the fact that technically it is illegal to use fireworks without a license in the philippines. but hey, it's the philippines, you don't need a license to do anything. including driving, but that's another point entirely.  so. people gather up their illegal fireworks, risk their various appendages, and prepare to celebrate the new year. i don't know how other families do it, but at our house all the radios are on - each one on a different station, depending on the musical preferences of the people in the house; my dad actually had his radio on the CLASSICAL station. for new year's. at around nine or ten PM, the countdowns start - top 100 songs of the past year, the best and worst songs, the cheesiest songs, the most romantic songs, what have you.  there are, of course, several superstitions surrounding new year's, and your activities on new year's will vary according to which one of them you believe. there are some who believe that whatever you're doing when the clock strikes midnight will reflect your fortunes for the rest of the year. one local singer, apparently a believer in this superstition, had her father play every single one of her songs in the hours leading up to midnight, in the hope that they would all hit the top of the charts in the upcoming years. (it was roselle nava, if you're curious.) others believe that jumping at the stroke of midnight will cause you to grow taller; my sister, desperate to grow past the 5-foot mark, was seen hopping like a rabbit in the minutes leading up to midnight. there's another superstition to the effect that new year's eve is when all the bad spirits start to roam the earth, and the only way to send them packing is by creating an unholy racket - apparently our bad spirits are wusses, since they're scared away by noise. i used to assume that this last superstition was derived from the chinese, but PH is chinese and she assures me that they have no such tradition. huh. well, i can't see the spanish or the americans propagating such a theory, and the japanese weren't around long enough to make a lasting cultural impact, so i suppose it's a native practice.  while we don't necessarily believe in superstitions at our house, we're up for any excuse to be noisy. at the stroke of midnight, my cousins and i start screaming and banging things - pots, pans, anything metallic - and turn the radios up full blast. this would normally bug the neighbors, but on new year's eve any noise we make pales in contrast to the sounds of fireworks going off and horns honking and other people yelling, up and down the street.  by the stroke of midnight, the air is black with smoke and gunpowder, visibility is low, and your ears feel permanently damaged by the noise. the celebrations start to pall two hours after new year actually hits, and that's when people head indoors to eat and make merry.  have i missed anything out?

      E gets major points for knowing that the proper way to bribe me is with a box of chocolates. all right, amigo, next time i won't "misplace" your hotel registration forms (although you must admit, you ended up with a pretty nice hotel room anyway. tsk. o ye of little faith). i make no such promises for your identification badge, because if i stopped harassing you, things would cease to be interesting. and heaven knows that in our line of work, things NEED to be made interesting.  lord, i'm tired. there really aren't enough hours in a day to cram in everything i want to do. right now i'm about three days behind in terms of sleep, and if i'm not careful i'll sleep the entire chinese new year away.  oh yes, it's chinese new year; you could hardly miss it. it's a big thing in KL - the chinese may be a minority ethnic group, but they know how to make their presence felt. for one thing, they own most of the businesses (as in the Philippines, the chinese are one of the main driving forces behind the malaysian economy) so when chinese new year comes around and people start taking leave to celebrate, KL begins to feel like a ghost town. starting tomorrow, entire offices and malls will begin to shut down and will not return to normal working hours until next wednesday, or later.  on the non-economic side, everything's draped in red, the auspicious color, and oranges are the fruit of the day. it's a custom to give out oranges during chinese new year, and so far we've gotten so many oranges that pretty soon i'm going to start bleeding Tang. the FedEx guy came today to pick up a document and i gave him an orange; he accepted it with a rueful grin and told me that it was his tenth orange for the day (it was only 10 AM).  good,  i said firmly.  more wealth for you, less oranges for us. because frankly, i've had enough vitamin C to ward off colds until armageddon arrives.  apparently oranges are symbolic of gold, since the word for orange -  lo kum , or  teochew kum , is similar to the word for gold, which is also  kum . hence the giving and receiving of oranges is supposed to be symbolic of the circulation of wealth. it's also cheaper; technically married couples are expected to give  ang pow , or small red packets containing money, to the unmarried (more reason not to get married). if you can't afford to do that - taking into consideration the fact that tradition demands that you place an even number of bills in the envelope - then you give oranges.  restaurants are offering chinese new year specials, namely  yee sang  - raw fish salad that you are supposed to toss with your chopsticks as high as possible; the higher you toss it the more successful your year will be. (note: toss as high as you like, but keep it on the plate or the waitresses won't be very happy with you.) mcdonald's is doing its part to contribute to the phenomenon of globalization in terms of the breakdown of cultural barriers, and is offering what it calls the prosperity burger. i don't understand what exactly is so prosperous about it, but it's good. it also comes with orange juice, sigh. at this point it would be nothing short of a miracle if anyone in KL came down with a cold.  at any rate, i have the entire weekend plus monday and tuesday to recuperate. office resumes on wednesday, and by then - by golly, i'll have caught up on all my sleep.  or not, since i remember that i'm supposed to go clubbing for the first time since new year's this friday and this coming monday, to make up for all the weekends i have not been going to bug my sister at her workplace.  moan. i would duplicate myself if i could, but (a) that isn't scientifically possible at this point and (b) the world doesn't really need another me.   ---  addendum to the Saga of Oranges, because it isn't over yet: just as we were preparing to leave the office, our travel agent called and asked me to come down. i presumed he wanted his check, so i went downstairs and took the check with me. once i got there, he took the check, thanked me, then opened his car and gave me TWO BOXES OF ORANGES.  which, added to the ones we already had in the office, made three boxes and a big bag full of oranges. since PH had already gone home, there were only two of us left to divide the oranges between ... and i was getting ready to sneak off and leave my boss with all of them, when he called me and dumped a box and the bag into my hands.   curses, foiled again.  so when my mother pulled up in front of my office to take me home, i hopped in, box, bag and all.  holy crap,  she said, quite inelegantly.   good afternoon, mother,  i replied, pleasantly.  would you like an orange? how about a dozen?   we spent the drive home eating oranges - managed to polish off four of them before we gave up on eating our way through the EverGrowingMoundOfOranges.  i have an idea,  i said.  let's toss them into the pool and swim through them, just because we can!   i think my mother would have said something, but she was laughing so hard that she choked on an orange seed, so she didn't.  at this rate, i AM going to bleed Tang - and Minute Maid, and various other brands of orange juice - by the time February rolls around. drink me for good health, y'all.

      it's been a week, and i'm finally getting off that holiday-induced high. is it the silence in the office? is it the strange, frightening clarity of vision from behind my new spectacles (glasses! dadgummit, GLASSES!)? is it the realization that three-fourths of the people in the HP fandom are probably latent pedophiles, and the other one-fourth are blatant ones?  maybe it's just hearing that fernando poe, jr., is thinking of running for president - nay, has announced his plans, according to the husband of one of my mom's friends, who was visiting KL for christmas. hearing that, i threw back my head and laughed until i cried, but they weren't tears of merriment. we haven't learned at all.  we never learn, in fact. we voted bongbong marcos into congress soon after the marcoses returned from exile. we voted loi estrada into the senate right after her husband was impeached. heck, as i understand it we voted mark jimenez into public office when we knew perfectly well america was trying to extradite him for ... something. i plead repression for not knowing.  see, i don't understand this. during ramos's term, there was this huge hullaballoo when he proposed a charter change - a rewriting of the constitution. by the ruckus raised nationwide, you'd think he'd suggested we all sacrifice our firstborn children to keep the population down. on the other hand - as my professor pointed out - it was no time for talk of changing the constitution. the philippines' political institutions had very weak foundations, she said; our constitution (the latest one, since we have 3 versions) hadn't been around long enough to have been established as a foundation.  what do these people think,  she demanded,  that we can change our political behavior and institutions the way we change a bad hairstyle?  that was the rationally expressed reason.  the irrational reason i got from truncated mutterings from my father; he was an activist during the marcos era, whose self-proclaimed life mission was "to kill marcos".  what happens after marcos dies?  my mother asked him, back when they were still dating, and she says he just gave her the blankest look. no one had ever really thought that far. in their heads, they figured that if marcos were gone, things would all be better. the hows and whys of getting to that theoretical utopia, however, were unclear.  people are still afraid. PH asked me a week ago  why do your people always protest against the government?  because here in malaysia, they think of activists as gangsters.    you have to understand,  i explained.  they're scared that martial law will happen again. they're terrified of disappearances in the night and the stifling of the freedom of speech and assorted other bogeymen that marcos very kindly introduced during his extended term as Dictator Of The Philippines.    was it really that bad?  she asked, and i just shrugged.    pain is pain, PH,  i told her.  and for an entire country to suffer for the megalomanic desires of one man - i understand the fear. but i hate how it's holding us back.   we're so childish, in a way, railing against the administration like we do.  ibagsak si ramos! ibagsak si erap! ibagsak si gloria!  (down with ramos! down with erap! down with gloria!) my God, after you've torn everyone down, who's going to be left standing? after you've criticized and turned down all the plans and goals and proposals that are being presented, what's left to do? it's as if we think that if only, if only so-and-so were gone from this position, things will be better. sometimes that's true; a lot of times, it's not.  i said, at the beginning of the year, that i'd been my own tormentor - and i did it so much more effectively than anyone else could have done. i had to come to a point where i was no longer willing to hurt myself before i could move forward.  my country, you and i have more in common than you think.

      first off: HAPPY NEW YEAR, EVERYBODY! i'm assuming that no one was stupid enough to play around with things that had the potential to blow off parts of the anatomy, so when i say hope everybody enjoyed the new year's celebration i am not picturing ER-type celebrations. me, i went clubbing and danced like a madwoman and discovered a new cocktail. i rang in the new year with miki, my temporary foster sister (aka an exchange student from japan, who is staying with us for a month and a half), my sister (who i snagged from waitressing for a few seconds so i could hug her), and a bunch of semi-drunk strangers. i have no clue if that was any kind of foreshadowing as to what kind of year 2003 is going to be, but it was mad fun, so i don't mind. much.  while we're talking of new year's-type things: i was intrigued by the  urlLink mayfly project , which i discovered through a link on  urlLink mia's  site. partially inspired by the fact that a mayfly's entire life can be summed up in four words: live. eat. shag. die., the site asks people to collate the past year of living into twenty words or less. i tried to do so, but the words wouldn't gel in ways that would tell you what this past year has felt like. after a long while i had something, but it was still not right, like a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces have not been put together properly. the pieces are all in place, but they're not locked down yet, because you haven't aligned the edges.   this was the final result:  In 2002 I began to write again. I forgave my parents a little more. I forgave myself.  of course it's rather raw, but i have no idea how to make it any better. and false modesty aside, it's much better than  what the f**k?  - which was, believe it or not, one of the entries up there. concise, yes, but not as all-encompassing and eloquent as the original four-word summary of the mayfly's life. and then there was the entire new year's resolution thing, which i pretty much gave up on before i even started it. a long long time ago i said 'sorry' to someone and she turned around, slapped me and told me not to lie and say sorry when i was going to do it again. i've never been able to use that word in the same way again - sincerely, with regret; i can get it out with ease when i'm apologizing for stepping on someone's toes or spilling things on them, but when it begins to mean something and i know it, the word freezes in my throat and i have to walk away. so if i've ever wronged you and failed to apologize, it was not because i didn't regret what i did, or because i was too proud. if the apology is worth any less for its wordlessness, then i must apologize a second time, because it's still too hard to say it.  one of my ongoing resolutions, though, is to learn how to talk, how to communicate. in 2001 i bought tori amos's first album and heard  silent all these years  for the first time, and for weeks that was the only song i listened to on that CD. tori claims that there is a story behind each song, a reason for its existence; i don't know what her story for that song was, but i knew what story i would give it, if i could:  when i was eleven we moved to manila from bangkok.  but that's not where it begins. it begins when i was three and we moved to bangkok, and i could barely speak english. my mother sent me to an english-speaking school to learn it, and i can still remember hugging the corners, sitting silently at the table and not saying anything because i didn't know how to speak english, and no one else could speak tagalog back to me. in manila we'd lived in my mom's old apartment, and there were always uncles and aunts and cousins underfoot. in bangkok it was just the four of us; in the daytime until early evening, just the three of us - my mother, my sister and me - because my father would leave early and come back home late. and later, it was pretty much just the three of us, because my dad travelled so much that sometimes he would be away for months on end and my sister would sleep with his shirt because she was afraid she would forget what he smelled like.  fast forward to eight years later, and this time it was the flip side of the coin: back in manila, near the place where i was born and grew up. my tagalog was fragmented, and it was hard to talk to people; my mother didn't want us to speak english because she was afraid people would kidnap us, so we had to use our rusty tagalog or be quiet. in school we were the kids with the funny accent; a girl came up to me once and asked me to talk, then laughed - at my accent, at the way i struggled to find the right words, maybe at something i said. a lot of times it was easier to just not talk, than to spend several minutes hunting for the right word, getting increasingly desperate because the person you were talking to was getting impatient. there was none of the forgiveness granted to foreigners learning the language, because we weren't foreigners. my sister got angry and defensive, and i - well, i'd always been quiet.  i figured that if i learned the language it would get better, but it wasn't just the language, it was so many things. clothing - some of the things we wore in bangkok were shocking or strange in manila. manners - in bangkok your food was your own, in manila it was considered rude if you didn't offer everyone a little bit of what you were eating. culture - in bangkok it was profane to touch someone else's head, in manila it was a sign of affection. so many things. these were the things no one thought to tell you about, simply because they were part of everyday life. no one noticed them unless you weren't doing them, so you learned only when someone commented, or laughed, or was offended.  that was at eleven. two years later it was the same situation all over again, only on a more personal level. at thirteen your body changes. you change. your relationships with people change. and just like two years before, there were so many things i wanted to talk about or ask or explain, only i didn't have the words yet. today, i can tell you eloquently that i felt lonely and strange and frustrated; i can explain that it was the onset of adolescence, that my parents were holding on to me too hard and i was pulling away too abruptly. back then there were no words, or there were too many, and i didn't know which ones were the right ones. at that time, my dad had just lost his job and we had just moved into a new house and things were tense all around, and the wrong words at the inappropriate time might get you slapped, or kicked, or something.  thirteen was my awful year, a year of silence and noise and ignorance. i hated myself that year. everything i said, everything i wore, everything i tried to do, was wrong - if not by my parents' or peers' standards, then by my own. in the mornings i tried not to fight with my mother; during the day i enjoyed school; in the afternoons i would go straight to my room and stay there so i wouldn't get into any trouble; and at night i would lie in bed and dream of falling or dying. my parents thought my silences were a sign of rebellion, and once it got my father so angry that he got up and wound his belt around his fist.  if you don't talk by the count of ten,  he said, his voice very soft,  i will hit your face with this.  it was one of the most helpless moments of my life: for seven counts i sat there, choking on air and fear and things i wanted to say but didn't know how to say, and all the time opening my mouth to show my father that i was trying to speak, i was. at the count of eight i stuttered out  what do you want me to say?  and shut my mouth, breathing hard.  and at the end of it all, it was still my fault: my mother got up from the table after my father had left and turned back to me:  look at what you made your father do to you,  she said.  years later - just last year, i think - my mother and i were hanging out at the kitchen table, talking, when she suddenly turned to me and asked  what were you thinking, when you were thirteen? you were so quiet then.   and that easily, i was thirteen again, wordless and frustrated and afraid and alone. i had to breathe before answering.  things,  i said.  normal things. the kind of stuff we talk about now.    so why didn't you just say them?  she continued, and she was sincere in her curiosity. for the first time in years, i saw myself from her viewpoint, and it made all easier.   i didn't have the right words,  i replied, very gently, and she just looked at me, not understanding. in that moment, i forgave her.  i still have moments like that, from time to time - moments when i'm so overwhelmed that the words will not gel in my head, or lose their way from mind to mouth. mostly they come when i'm afraid, or stressed, or frustrated, and i suspect in a small way - like G so eloquently said before - part of me is still in that room, suffocating with fear and anger and frustration.  like i said, this year i learned - and i'm still learning, slowly - how to put that behind. i can't be that girl, stuck in that room, forever. i refused to tell people these stories for so long because my skin crawled at the thought of being labelled 'victim', or pitied. and yet - by being silent i locked myself in that same room, victimizing myself every time i remembered.  i'm forgiving them, incident by incident. i'm forgiving myself as well - for getting into situations like that, for making them feel and act that way, for hating myself so much that i thought i wasn't worth the oxygen it took to keep me alive. as any person who's been hurt will tell you, it doesn't help for people to tell you that it wasn't your fault, because some part of you will always feel guilty. it helps more to just look back - to be objective and rational - and to forgive yourself, even though at times it really wasn't your fault.   i've been here,  tori sang,  silent all these years.   i'm breaking the silence. i'm forgiving myself. i'm forgiving them. and i'm talking.  and yeah, it feels good.

      27 February 2003 / 3:24 PM  all things being equal, and my sister being the linkin park obsessive that she is, this conversation took place yesterday:   sister:  you remember the linkin park picture where brad and phoenix had The Hair?  me : i constantly pray to forget it, but yes.  sister:  okay, so there's a story behind it. apparently the guys decided to have an afro-growing contest.  me  what!? why?  sister:  because they want to start a new fashion trend. i don't know. they're men, they're strange by default. anyway, they showed it on the LP network thing.  me  i bet i know who backed out first.  sister:  so they set it up, right? joe was all um, no. right off the bat.  me  yeah, i couldn't see joe going for the 'fro thing. i mean, this is the man who had CGI whales floating in the sky, he doesn't need to get any weirder.  sister:  and rob tried, but at some point he just looked in the mirror and was all you know what, i'm just not feeling the 'fro. and off it went. then mike and chester -   me  mike grew an afro? when? and why did you not show me the incriminating pictures off the internet?  sister:  because you keep on accusing me of being a stalker. i keep telling you, i am not responsible for the things that get posted on the internet.  me  you are responsible for the things you find because that means you went looking for them. remember your Hanson phase? that website that had information on the color of taylor hanson's toothbrush?  sister:  that was scary, yes, and for future reference, my official press statement is that i never had a Hanson phase.  me  i reserve the Sister's Right to Blackmail.  sister:  hey, i know you like the Backstreet Boys.  me  yes, but unlike you, i am not ashamed of it. i would willingly go to BSB concerts and make heart signs in the air and scream things like Howie, i wanna have your baby!  sister:  warn me before you do that, i'm going to have to change my name and have plastic surgery. but yes, mike had an afro. he was like you know, when i think 'fro, i think big and fluffy, very beyoncé knowles. my hair is more edward scissorhands. i am a disgrace to afros everywhere. and chester - you know how his hair is a little curly?  me  oh my lord, don't tell me -   sister:  it was bad. chester was like i have CURLS! and the guys were all fascinated with the way it would spring back when they pulled it. and you know how he has a son and it wouldn't be good for Draven's future emotional development to learn that his hard rocker dad went through a Goldilocks phase. so their 'fros had to go. and then it was only brad and phoenix.  me  are they planning to get rid of it anytime soon? or anytime, period?  sister:  at this point they're still in the Macho Phase of Stubbornness, where manliness is proved by outlasting the other in whatever stupid contest they've devised, so who knows. as long as it doesn't affect their music, i'm cool with it. except maybe now the two of them will have to be permanently stationed behind the other four, because otherwise their hair will block out the small ones. namely, chester.  later that evening we went out, because my dad wanted to have a family portrait taken. he'd wanted to have it done ever since christmas, but we'd never been able to gather everybody together at the same time, so it had remained undone. miki - the japanese exchange student who's been staying with us for the past month - is leaving to stay with a new family at the end of the week, so last night my dad herded us all together and took us off to the nearest studio.  afterwards we headed to bangsar for dinner; everybody's eyes widened when my order came because there was so much of it.  how come they gave you so much?  my sister asked.   'cause i'm pretty,  i said without thinking, and the entire family raised their eyebrows. i raised my hands defensively:  look, i don't know, okay? don't look gift horses in the mouth.  actually, it may have been due to the fact that i was wearing a loose, low-cut blouse and no bra that night, but we'll never know for sure.  my sister's portions were equally generous:  you're not the only one who's pretty,  she pointed out. five minutes later, miki tapped me on the shoulder:  até,  she said happily,  i'm pretty too!  - because the restaurant had apparently decided to be liberal with the servings that night.  our eyebrows shot back up when dad finally got his order, though - i have never seen a bigger bowl of soup.  okay,  my sister said after a brief, stunned silence.  it's official, dad's the prettiest.   the proofs of our family portrait come out on saturday. i'm crossing my fingers, because the dress i wore for the formal portrait was a little shorter, tighter, and lower-cut than i remembered it being.  hooker chic!  i exclaimed in the dressing room, because my sister's dress was equally short and low-cut, although not quite as tight.  this is gonna be a non-family-oriented family portrait.   nope, still don't have a normal family.

      after thinking about it a while, i realized that malaysia is not exactly the best place in the world to muse about my status as woman versus commodity. granted it's a very modern country, but you've got the occasional (more than occasional, but i was being diplomatic) oddball who will give you a politely surprised look, as if to say "there's a difference?"  i was reminded of that yesterday, when i was walking to the hotel where the philippine secretariat is staying. i was in full professional regalia - conservative suit, comfortable but slightly sexy shoes (i *am* 22, after all, not 58), and no-nonsense black workbag. would you believe a car actually drew to a stop beside me and the driver leaned out to give me a suggestive grin? i gave him an annoyed look and flashed my badge at him (all participants in the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement are assigned ID badges), then watched as he sheepishly drove away.  but speaking of being a commodity, i've once again been outsourced - or, to be more accurate, hijacked - from my office. technically our office has no involvement in the NAM - it's mostly a diplomatic / political affair, so nix on the trade/investment promotion, which is our mandate. hence imagine my surprise when they called me up last week, asking why i wasn't at the embassy meetings - apparently someone put me on the secretariat without asking my boss, much less me.  aside from feeling uncomfortably like a piece of office equipment ( do you need rei? no? okay, send her over then, we're short a person. ), i'm a little tired. my office isn't involved, so work goes on as usual ... which means that in the mornings i'm at my office and in the afternoons and evenings i'm at the secretariat. fifteen minutes in between, i'm usually walking from the office to the hotel - an ordinary task made arduous by the fact that i'm wearing 2-inch heels. i could be practical and wear flats, but my legs look fat in them and i'm vain enough to sacrifice a little comfort for glamour. that sounds incredibly retarded until you remember that i wasn't born pretty, i have to make do with what i have - and what i have happens to look better in 2-inch heels than in flats.   it's not the work, though - the exact opposite; more like the lack of it, and how tense i am when people are working around me and i'm doing nothing. it sounds ridiculous, but up to now i haven't been given much information on what i'm supposed to do. i've descended to soliciting work from all and sundry -  d'you want me to type that? or here, i'll photocopy that for you. and staple it. and put it in a folder. and label it. and ... oh, okay, you can have it now.  - and when there's nothing to do, obsessively tidying up the room.  i finally commandeered the phone and dedicated myself to answering calls, but that wasn't very comfortable when the officers from manila arrived. apparently i have a very strong american accent, so whenever i picked up the phone, the manila people would turn around and stare. the embassy staff are used to me, but the manila people weren't. at first they figured i was malaysian, so they were talking to me in english - but i replied in tagalog, which got me even stranger looks. at one point, i heard one of them whisper,  is she filipino?  to the secretariat head, and her affirmative answer. it was like my first year in manila all over again.  today it's raining and the secretariat called me up, asking me to come early ( now, if possible  were the exact words, but i can't ditch my boss like that). looks like i'll be walking through rain - a pleasant prospect if i weren't wearing my pretty, painful, pretty painful shoes.   strangely though, i am managing to have fun. i wonder how.

      sometimes it's hard to draw lines. are you a woman or are you a piece of meat?  and it gets even harder when not even your friends seem to remember. when you say something, are they assuming that you're asking for it? when you laugh with them, kid around and get comfortable, are they thinking that you're leading them on?  how exactly do you differentiate between who you are, behind the flesh, and who they see?  it's been two - almost three years now, and i still don't understand what happened.  it's your fault,  i told myself in the mirror, because when i dissected it down to bits and pieces, sans emotion, i found that i'd been a participant in it.  but if i'd been a participant,  i told a friend a year later,  why didn't i feel anything?   woman or meat, i still can't tell.

      i'm so furious i could spit. in fact, i'm so furious that i will - ptooey! take THAT, bishop teodoro bacani and the aptly named cardinal sin, archbishop of manila. God bless you for all the good you have done in His name, but seriously, the two of you need to step back and reassess your priorities in life.  in this week's issue of  Time  is a short sidebar on the philippine Catholic Church's stand on birth control and its effect on the local population. apparently we're reproducing like rabbits - at an annual rate of 2.34% or something like that, while our GNP is only growing at an annual rate of 3.1%. according to the sidebar, at this rate our population will double - DOUBLE - by 2030. currently there are 80 million filipinos in the philippines, and that only counts the people who were included in the official census. if we keep it up at our current rate of reproduction, there will be 160 million of us stuffed into the teeny weeny philippine islands by the time i'm 50. good luck to anyone who likes breathing.  the philippine Catholic Church's stand on birth control has long been a strong NO - that is, they believe that it is God's will that His people "go forth and multiply", and to impede the natural forces of reproduction in any way is - their words - sinful. (not kidding - a congressman who tried to pass a family planning bill was actually accused of being a "Satanist" and an "Anti-Christ" for flouting this command.) they have also denied the causative link between the increase in population and poverty. now, i'm not catholic, but you don't have to be a non-catholic to see how ridiculous that is.  for one thing: we are a poor country. poor as in hardcore poor, as in perhaps a good 40% of our population cannot afford to buy basic necessities such as food and clothing. for another: we are a relatively small country. yes, we have a longer coastline than the United States, but fat lot of good that's going to do us when you can't live on the damn coastline because we have TYPHOONS. for yet another: does no one think it's ridiculous that the people urging us to mate and produce gazillions of babies are CELIBATE? they're not the ones who have to bear the kids, raise them, feed them, worry about their futures, pay for their education, and eventually turn into productive members of society.  to top it all off - recently, the president gave a speech in which she vaguely admitted to there being a link between population increase and poverty, and hinted that she would like to see the use of "modern technology" in effecting population control. whereupon bishop bacani got on his high horse, demanded that the president explain herself (the president! explain herself - to a priest! only in the philippines, i swear to heaven), and told press that he was "hurt" by her implications. the president meekly backed down, insisting that she had meant that family planning should only take place by means of the "natural" method.   by all that's holy, get over yourself, man. at any rate, in this case natural is not better; more children have been conceived worldwide through use of the rhythm method than any other method.  am i overreacting? am i still making sense? it pisses me off beyond all common sense, truly it does. (again, i say PTOOEY!!) years of this conditioning, of this kind of teaching, have produced a population that shuns birth control - condoms, birth control pills, IUDs, diaphragms, spermicidal jelly, etcetera - as sinful. i have known people who are perfectly comfortable committing adultery, or indulging in premarital sex (although both are verboten in the Catholic faith), but shy from using birth control devices.  three years ago one of my best friends started having sexual relations with her boyfriend for the first time. as girlfriends often do, she told me all about it, and i cautioned her about using birth control, since we were both still in college and neither of us was planning on being a mommy at that age.  but i can't walk into a store and buy condoms, i CAN'T!  she told me, blushing furiously. i, ever shameless, went to the drugstore and bought her an assortment ( thin? thick? ribbed? studs?  or, i said, holding up a gold disc and flicking it with an evil grin,  these gold thingamajigs. like julia said, nothing gets through these suckers. ), which i tucked into her bags despite her protests. a week later she slept with him again, but didn't use the condoms. when i asked why, she told me that her boyfriend didn't like them.   screw him,  i said, before rethinking my choice of idiom.  or don't, unless he gets that condom on. who cares what he wants? it's your body and it's your life that's going to be in tatters if you get knocked up.   she didn't confide in me much after that, because every time i saw her i would nag her about using birth control. six months later she came to my door - pale and thin, with desperation in her eyes.  i'm late,  she said flatly, after i'd let her in and we'd scuttled up to my room.  i'm late and i think i might have an STD.   that was one of the most horrible conversations i've ever had in my life. she was out of control - kept on lighting up cigarettes and putting them out, then lighting them up again. her hands were shaking very badly. sometime during the conversation, she turned to me and said  rei, you've got to help me, do you know what i have to take to abort a baby?  and we fought because i refused to have anything to do with her planned abortion. i finally managed to talk her into waiting until i'd bought her a pregnancy test, then i sat with her while we waited for the results. she burst into tears when it came out negative, then walked out of my house. i didn't see her again until two weeks later, when she told me she'd broken up with her boyfriend.  my point is - why teach that the use of contraceptives is sinful, when it actually prevents a greater harm? on one hand, preventing conception helps avoid situations where abortion would become an option. on the other hand, it also helps avoid situations where children are born willy-nilly into families that are unable to support and provide for them. this is also a sore spot for me - i've seen too many children born to people who could not afford to take care of them properly, and they ended up abused or neglected or dead. my parents were children like these - both born into poor families that had seven children each, my mother ended up physically, emotionally, and sexually abused; my dad was emotionally neglected.  rationally speaking, i do believe that these people - bishop bacani and his ilk - are arguing from a genuine belief that their way is God's way. but think, my good men, think - would God have willed children to be born into families too poor to support them? would God have willed that children conceived at unwanted times be aborted? if you're going to argue on the basis of God's will, then so can i - and i make more sense, i believe.  i'm still angry, but underneath it all is this large heavy sadness. so many things are wrong with my country, and i'm feeling smaller and less capable by the minute.

       gong xi fa chai , everyone.  in an absolutely evil mood because i belatedly received a text message from my boss asking me to come in at 8:30AM today to help him out on a visit. my phone's battery ran out a day or so ago and i didn't find the charger until this morning, which is when i received the message. well, there's not much point in my reporting to work now, is there? not that i would have been able to, at any rate ... i woke up at 7:30AM this morning and there was no way i could have gotten out of bed - my body felt like it had been worked over several times by the swedish masseuses from hell. it's just ... agh, i hate it when this happens. now i'm going to feel guilty for a week.  - - -  on the Topic-That-Must-Not-Be-Broached: well, i'm going to bring it up, nyah nyah nyah. it's valentine's month, the Most Dreaded Month Of All - not just for the single, who get shunted aside like yesterday's wilted flowers, but for the people who think that love deserves a little more respect than it actually gets on Valentine's Day. the point of this all, of course, is that we of the Anti-Valentine are not exactly Anti-Love, or Anti-Romance, or what have you - as we are often accused of being. quite the contrary, in fact - we do believe in love, as it would be quite pointless and stupid to deny its existence.  what we are against is the way love is usually portrayed - as starry-eyed attraction, sweaty-palmed lust, or mooning stupidity. we are also doubly against the promotion of Valentine's Day as some sort of memorial day for love, especially since it's been so distorted by commercialism. we believe that love, should you be so fortunate to be able to experience it, is something that cannot be expressed or compressed into a single day's celebration. at any rate, when that single day gradually morphs into an excuse to toss trinkets of affection toward people who are usually overlooked and unappreciated, it no longer celebrates love anyway.  and yes, i'm using the royal plural because i don't have my own personal band of sycophants. don't worry, i'll round them up eventually.  in the meantime, i WILL celebrate the month of love - but my way. which is to say - no hearts, no flowers, no romance. just real stories, some of which don't have a happy ending, but which - i think - are far more appropriate to the season than the usual Hallmark commercial fare. so, the first:  it was a week after september 11, 2001, and the world was still crawling around, blind with tears and blood and grief, looking for safety in the ruins of something that had crumbled like chalk and cheese in the middle of what had been a very ordinary afternoon. we were at home, watching TV - another telethon dedicated to those who had perished, and after a while we switched to another channel.  then my sister asked:  if you were one of those people, trapped in that burning building, would you have jumped or would you have stayed?   and, just like i remembered it in  urlLink this entry , i thought about it, and answered:  i guess i would have stayed - found someone who had more to lose than i did, and held on to him or her until we were both dead.    because i don't have anything to lose, really. i've lived twenty-two years, and i've fallen in love and lost people and made friends and been betrayed and everything in between, and i'm loved. if i died, it wouldn't matter because i'd had all that. and i think my sister understood, because she just nodded.   on the other hand,  i added,  if i were with someone i loved and trusted and cared for, i'd jump.    like that couple who leaped out the window holding hands,  she said.   exactly,  i said.  if i knew i had no choice but to die, then it would be one of the best ways to die - on my own terms, with a hand to hold on the way down. i don't think i'd be scared at all.   there was a long silence, and we continued watching television. after a while, my sister switched it off and turned to walk away. she was halfway across the room when she turned back to look at me.  you know what,  she said, half-smiling.  if we'd been there, i'd have jumped with you.

      got into a massive argument yesterday with a client - well, not exactly a client. the story is that they came to our office and offered to donate a fund of USD5 billion to the Philippine government for developmental purposes, and we asked for information on their foundation so we could forward the proposal to the government.  so yesterday one of them called up, sounding extremely peeved with what he felt was unnecessary waffling around on our part.  we are DONATING to your country,  he told me, angrily.  we are not applying for jobs. why are you making it so hard?    i understand that,  i replied, also upset (this was the middle part of the argument, so by this time we'd both run short of patience).  but i'm asking you to see things from my position as well. so far we have the proposal for the fund, but no information on *who* is donating. we appreciate the thought, but there is no way we will be able to forward this to the president's office.    your president knows who our foundation is,  he insisted.  just give the documents to her, why do you keep on hiding them?   i bristled at that.  two things,  i snapped.  first - we forwarded the documents already and were explicitly instructed to obtain more information, which we are trying to do now. second - if the president knows who you are, why don't you just send the documents to her in a confidential package?    because i know you people, you'll just reroute it through your endless departments!  he retorted.  that is your problem, you government workers - you think like robots! you do only what you've been trained to do!   it didn't end there, but that part stuck. on the logical side, i suppose i had a right to insist that they provide us with more information, but i'm still haunted by what he said. i've always disliked civil servants, simply because most of them are exactly what that man accused me of being - bureaucratic. the type of people who will watch you come in bleeding and half-dead, hand you a sheaf of paperwork, and ask you to  fill out these forms in triplicate, and don't drip blood on them, that's a dear - it's a nightmare documenting cases where the details have been obscured by bodily fluids  - in short, people who are so bound by rules and the hierarchy that they forget the true objective of their job.  in one of my MBA classes, we discussed that - the "old" model versus the "re-engineered" model, where the previous paper-pushing organization was restructured so that each member of the organization was results-oriented. no more endless forms and approvals, just a streamlined procedure where the essential processes had been identified, refined, and reorganized in a more efficient manner. i liked the idea - i've always hated waiting in lines and filling out forms - and thought that it would be a good thing to apply in the workplace.  and now here i am, a government worker, caught in the cogs of the bureacracy, afraid that i'm becoming yet another piece of this ungainly machinery. so maybe i was right in this case - what about in other cases? do i ask for unnecessary documentation? do i shuffle people around when i can get up and guide them through the process myself? do i palm off certain tasks as being 'outside my responsibility', just because i don't want to get involved?  it horrifies me no end to think that i might have become exactly what i loathed, but sometimes i don't know how to escape being this way and most times it's exhausting to be otherwise. and yet all my reasons for acting like a typical government worker sound suspiciously like excuses - the budget is too small, there are too few of us, there's too much to do and so little time to do it in, i can't do that because it doesn't fall under the mandate of my office. they're valid reasons, i know that, but does it matter? when i'm part of a government that is supposed to be helping its citizenry, does any of that matter?  SD will probably tell me: that's the way it works, it's not like you can change things overnight. but it's not changing things that bothers me, exactly - it's the thought that i could become this way. i can still remember my graduation so clearly, and what i thought i'd become, and the kind of worker i promised myself i never would be, and - have i fallen short?  it's a question worth asking, because i'm sure no one ever started out thinking  i want to be a boring, mindless, bureaucratic government drone!  and yet somehow they end up that way, because otherwise 'government' would be synonymous with 'sparkling efficiency, diligence, and courtesy'.

      after jenny walked out of his life, forrest gump ran across america for three years, three months and sixteen hours. then he turned around and ran straight back into her arms.  when i was fourteen, i dreamed i ran away from home. it was very very vivid; in my dream i was sitting at my desk, writing. then i looked out of my window and up at the stars, the night was cold and i was wearing my nightgown - and i got up, quietly opened my door, crept out into the hallway past my sister's room and past my parents' room, down the stairs and out the door and past the dogs, out the gate -   and i ran. barefoot and in my nightgown, i ran up and down streets, trying to get out of our subdivision. i was nearly out when i heard something behind me and i turned and there was a car trailing me, and i knew they wanted me back.  so i turned and ran another way, and it was a macabre game of tag, with the car playing it. at some point - i was running on jade street, toward the subdivision's basketball court - my legs gave out, and i fell down, crying because i'd run my fastest and my farthest, and i still hadn't gotten away.  then the car door opened and they took me back home.  the point being that you really can't run away from things, can you? either you go back and face them, or they hunt you down.

      Two days ago my mother turned 52, and both my parents celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary. It's strange to think that they've made it so far, although it hasn't been perfect. Today, while we were having dinner, I asked them:  How does it feel to have been married 24 years?  and the two of them just laughed, my mother leaning against my father's shoulder, my father turning to smile down at her.  It wasn't sweet so much as it was comfortable, which kind of describes their whole relationship: the way they like hanging out together and being dorky together and bitching at the world together. The way they don't fit perfectly into each other, but have found angles at which some parts of them complement. The way he doesn't go to the doctor without her because he doesn't know how to tell them what's wrong with him; the way he stays in the shallow end with her because she can't swim, even though he wants to do laps at the deeper end.  How far they've come, how long the journey's been, and how strange and wonderful that they're still travelling together.

      I've been all over the Philippines, it seems, in the past couple of weeks. Just a week or so ago I was in Bohol - a small island off Cebu, I think* - visiting my friend M, who is there championing one of her father's causes. We didn't have much time together - two nights and two days, which is short if you consider that we haven't seen each other for two years - so we barely slept, while I was there. My first night we stayed up talking until we literally fell off to sleep; my second night we went down to the beach with her cousins and stayed there until dawn, eating and drinking. We fried fish and waded through the waters under a full moon and (evil evil us) taught her two 15-year-old cousins how to drink tequila. One got drunk, while the other stayed quietly tipsy and wondered why M and I were not at all affected by all the alcohol we were imbibing.  Practice, dear heart,  we laughed.  Then from Bohol I went home, stayed one night, and was off the next day to Gemma's house with Laya to pack and prepare for our trip to Puerto Galera - a beach along the coastline of Oriental Mindoro*. My father called while I was in PG; much to his dismay, he discovered that neither my mother, my sister nor I were in the house - nor, for that matter, in the same geographical location. When he called, my mother was in Bicol, visiting her brother; my sister was in La Union with some cousins, learning how to surf; and I was in Puerto Galera, beachcombing. My aunt, who answered the phone, told me later that he sounded utterly gobsmacked. Poor thing.  I'm currently resting; as I told PH earlier in an e-mail, there is such a thing as too much vacation. Puerto Galera turned out to be a nightmarish vacation, the type that DOES NOT END, not even when you've had more than enough. Times like that, you learn what you are truly made of, and where your breaking points lie. At the terminal, faced with the prospect of not being able to go home for yet another day, I found my breaking point:  I have ONE set of clean clothes, and I am wearing them,  I pointed out to E, who called my phone because I texted him, begging him to help me retain my sanity.  The water we used to bathe last night was saltwater. I am cramping, my clothes do not match, I smell like the sea and I can still feel sand in between my toes and coated on the soles of my shoes. I am THISCLOSE TO HYSTERIA!    Situations like this build character,  you know, replied E, who was laughing all throughout my diatribe. I did not take offense, as I realized how incredibly crazy I sounded, but on the other hand it was not very funny since I was IN the fricking situation.   I do not want character!  I howled into my phone, causing all and sundry in the terminal to glance askance my way.  I want to go home, take a bath, dump my clothes in the wash, and sleep in a clean bed with no sand anywhere!  E wisely realized that I was at the point of no reason, and ceased all logical discussion.  Now - freshly bathed, my clothes in the wash, and with the prospect of a calm night's sleep ahead of me - I can look back and see that if anyone wants to break me, all they have to do is abandon me on an island with no soap and changes of clothing. I swear to you, I will break in three hours.  I return to Kuala Lumpur in a couple of days, and I am simultaneously dreading and anticipating it. Kuala Lumpur is beginning to represent routine and regularity, an air-conditioned bedroom and predictable traffic patterns and a social-political-economic environment that is perpetually safe. One part of me craves that discipline, the lines and perpendicularity of such a life - and the other suffocates there and thrives instead in Manila, where everything is hot and murky and tropical and unpredictable.  And then again, I've lost so much in the past month that I thought I was absolutely sure of, and I've gained what I never even thought about having.  * Just so you know, I am severely geographically-challenged. I can get lost in areas that are within a 5km-radius of my house. So if I were my reader, say, I would take all of my geographical descriptions with more than a grain of salt. Yes?

      The heat is incredible; by afternoon I am so drained that I find a cool corner and sit there and just DO NOT MOVE, to keep my body temperature from rising. Right now I'm tired and sleepy and HOT and still surrounded by gazillions of people, but I have to get these things down before they disappear.  Three days ago: Spent the night at Gemma's place with Laya and Marlen. Laya told me that she hadn't painted or written for seven years, and I confessed that I had similar problems.  I haven't finished a story in years,  I said.  The words come until a certain point, and then leave.   Laya nodded.  Don't work too hard at it,  she advised.  The characters come because they have something they want to say. Let them tell their own story.   Yesterday was the surrealest of the surreal. I spent the whole day at the National Heart Center with V, because her father's been confined there for an abnormally high blood pressure. In the evening we went out to have a quick dinner and a stroll around the UP Chapel before V went in to attend Mass. On our way in, a girl stepped into our path and said  Até, bili po kayo?  (Older Sister, would you like to buy?) as she waved a string of hair bands at me. I paused - I didn't really need a hair band, since my hair was already tied back. But she was smiling at me, and asked  Ate, naaalala n'yo pa ba ako?  (Older Sister, do you still remember me?); I looked closer and realized, with a little shock, that I did indeed remember her.  In college there was a group of girls who used to go around selling hair ties to the female students; I ran into them all the time. They liked me, I think, because I was an easy mark; every time I saw them, I either bought hair ties or promised to buy some next time. Over the course of four years, I began talking to them - asking them why they were working, what their families were like, where they went to school. I found out that they were scholars at a nearby Catholic school; they went to school in the afternoons, and sold hair bands in the mornings to earn money for expenses such as textbooks and pencils and shoes. Before I graduated from UP, I said goodbye to the two oldest ones, and they asked me if I would come back to buy hair bands from them again.  Maybe,  I said, laughing.  Three years down the line, I still recognized her - one of those girls - and she me, although it was dark and we weren't really the best of friends and I'm terrible at remembering faces.  Até , she said again,  Please buy from me. I've got problems, I need money.    Oh, come,  I replied, smiling at her,  Don't we all. What kind of problems do you have?   Of course I was expecting something along the lines of  My mother is pregnant with her eighth child  or  My father just spent all of my school money on his stupid alcohol  - that, I could have handled. But she said  I have a baby, Até .   What!  I exclaimed, staring hard at her. Beside me, V was watching us with fascination.  But - but - who's the father?    I don't know,  she confessed.  He ran off and I didn't try to go after him because anyway, he paid me. And Até, I didn't know how hard it was to have a child.    Heaven help us,  I said, feeling extremely lost.  How old are you?    Seventeen,  she said.  I didn't really know what to say, so my older sister persona took over.  Look,  I told her sternly as I handed her money and she handed over the hair bands,  Children are extremely difficult, and you shouldn't have had to give birth to one to find that out. And you're too young to be fooling around with things like these! Next time we see each other, we must have a talk.    Yes, Até , she said meekly, waving to us as we continued along the path to the Chapel. I think that even when I am eighty, I will see her face and her eyes in my head, the way they were when she stepped out of the darkness to talk to me.  That night, I had to go out; I texted E and he said yes, he was going out and would we like to join him? We ended up in Decades along Tomas Morato, and E was so safe - a reminder of the antiseptic order of KL, and the way pain is clean there, like scalpels - that for the rest of the night, I danced and drank and forgot, and was grateful.  But now it's afternoon, and I'm back in the sizzling heat of sun and people, and I can see the lost look in that girl's eyes again.

      Conversations I had in KL, days and hours before coming here, are replaying themselves in my head now. The things we spoke about, and the things we said - was it prescience? Was it a quiet tap on the shoulder, a warning that coming back is never easy? I told Hoffe months ago that  I'm so good at leaving; now I'm trying to be equally good at coming back.  The thing is, though, it's so much easier to cut strings than to try to tie them back together.  Two days before departure, I went out with a few friends and ended up in Y's house, playing truth poker (something like strip poker, only instead of taking off clothes, you have to tell the truth. It's harder than it sounds). Sometime around 2AM, the thrill faded and we sat there, absently shuffling the cards instead of dealing them out for another game. We began talking about everything and anything, ending up, absurdly, on the topics of relationships and sex and marriage. From there we went to Manila and independence, and Y turned to me and said  Days in Manila are so unpredictable.   PA, our other friend, looked slightly puzzled; he moved to KL when he was 11 and has been back to Manila infrequently since then.  Is it so different,  he asked,  from KL?   Y and I shared a glance and laughed.  KL is to Manila as a carousel is to a rollercoaster,  I said.  The days here travel on smooth wheels; you know when to get on and when to get off. In Manila you hop on, buckle up and clench your teeth, and hope to God that the day takes you where you need to go.   And then - hours before departure - C and I got into a fight. Back and forth, back and forth we went, until finally we both collapsed on her bed in the middle of the clothes she'd set out for packing.  I don't belong anywhere,  she told me, as we lay there, tired and frustrated.  I feel as if I have to change every time we go somewhere new, just so that I don't stick out so much, and it doesn't even help because I don't fit in anymore.    You fit in with me,  I said, and it felt clumsy, as if I were reaching out in the dark and were hitting rocks instead of her hand.  I fit in with you. If you shut me out, or if I shut you out, then we're both screwed. Who are you going to be real with, if not with me? And who can I be absolutely real with, if not with you?    I'm so tired of changing,  she murmured.  But what scares me the most is not the changing; it's - if I *don't* change, if I stay my real self, what do I do if people don't like me?   - - -  So far, it feels like I'm dancing a cotillion two beats behind time - swaying to the right while everyone else is swaying to the left, taking an extra step to find my place when everyone else has settled into theirs. I want to dilate time, to stretch the moments so that I have my few extra seconds to move back into place, to get used to the beat.  On the other hand, I could dilate time until it stretched a million years, and I am afraid I would always be two beats behind.

      Still with the weird dreams. Last night I dreamt I was with a girl whose brother had been murdered in a particularly gory way - he'd been hacked to pieces. We weren't at the scene of the crime; we were somewhere else and her mother called her phone and told her to get down to the morgue, the remains of her brother's body were there. Apparently the girl and I were close friends, because I accompanied her to the morgue to identify the body.  The dream skipped over the identification process, thank goodness, and fast-forwarded to a particularly gross segment: my friend, grief-stricken over the loss of her brother and apparently guilt-laden about his death, decided to mummify his remains and carry them around with her in a cloth bag.  Here's where it gets even stranger. We were standing in a public bathroom, in front of the mirrors. I was leaning back against one of the stall doors; my friend pulled out the cloth bag, laid it carefully in one of the sinks, and unwrapped it, reaching in to stroke one of her dead brother's hands.  Don't unwrap it , I said irritably, reaching up to fix my hair.  We've got to go to ________ soon, and you know you're required to cover your head every time we go in.   She nodded and began rewrapping the parcel.  I just realized , she said, casually,  We can't go in there carrying something, our hands need to be free.    Make a sling , I suggested.  Carry it on your back.    Oh, that would be a great idea , she replied,  but we only have two cloths - one for your head and one for mine. I'll have to carry this on my head.   Having said that, she put her bundle on top of her head and fastened it there with her head covering.  I told my mother about that dream this morning; she was creeped out and it showed.  Goodness , she exclaimed,  What have you been reading about lately that you'd dream about these things?    I have no clue,  I replied.  To tell you the truth,  I told her,  It creeped me out majorly, too.  We ended the discussion there, and went on to other stories. I did not tell my mother that the dream had not ended there.  This is how it ended, the last scene before I woke up and could not go back to sleep: my friend put the bundle on her head, she tied it on with her head covering, I covered my own head, and we left the bathroom. Before I went out the door, I turned back one last time to check my face in the mirror. In my reflection, I saw - to my great surprise and horror - that the bundle was on *my* head, not my friend's.  I turned back to call my friend, to ask her why it was on my head, and she was not there. There was only a janitress mopping the floor; I tapped her on the shoulder and said  Excuse me, did you see where my friend went?   She looked at me, bewildered.  What friend?  she asked.  I've been mopping here ever since you went in. You've been alone in there all this time, miss.   And then I woke up.

      Things that slip by without you really noticing: dead leaves. Wild birds. Grass, and cars. Pages of a very absorbing book. People you have loved for so long that you are beginning to take them for granted.  Time.  It slipped by without my noticing, but I will not let it pass completely without comment: Happy Birthday,  luminae . It's been a year now, and I am still here, and that is something of a miracle. How do you feel about another year together?  - - -   The things I'm dreaming, now. All connected to water in some way; Laya and Gemma may have been the ones to almost-drown in Puerto Galera, but I think I was the one who took the ocean home. A couple of nights ago I dreamed I was talking to a fish, arguing about the best way to go home. The fish - a large silver one with big buggy eyes - seemed annoyed by my tenaciousness.  Why are you being so pig-headed,  it finally snapped,  It's not like you know where your home is anyway.    Oh, I know!  I cried.  I live in Kuala Lumpur, in M______.   Whereupon it looked at me with utter scorn and a little bit of pity, and said  I wasn't talking about where you  live , sweetfins.  And then it kissed me and turned into E, who laughed and swam away.  Although perhaps it isn't really about water at all.

      Have the mother of all headache attacks; if I move my head wrong, a little metal ball starts rolling around inside my skull and bumping HARD into soft places inside. This is what my tension headaches feel like, but I'm not tense so I'm not sure what the problem is.  Or maybe I am - tense, or perhaps the word is overstretched. I've been spending the past week saying goodbye to KL - eating Malaysian food nonstop, partying, going back to my old hangouts, meeting up with people, et cetera. This coming Saturday I'm going to be on another flight back to Manila (where, I hear, there's an ongoing coup d'etat - whoever complains of boredom in Manila is either lying or a hermit) and it'll be several months before I return - that is, if I return at all. But I can't complain; I've packed more living into the past few days than I've done in the past few years in KL.  Just yesterday I managed to fulfill one of my long-time dreams, which was to perform with a live band onstage at a bar somewhere. Turns out that one of my sister's friends had just started up a band, they'd landed a gig at this chintzy little bar downtown, and they needed a backup singer. My sister volunteered me, and so Saturday evening found me onstage, purring India Arie's  Promises . It didn't turn out too well - the band was too new, we'd practiced only once, and our playlist wasn't exactly geared to the musical taste of the audience - but my dream was fulfilled nonetheless. RZ, the lead singer, was disappointed to find out that I was leaving; we got along pretty well and blended quite nicely with each other,and she wanted me to join the band.  At this point, though, I suppose I could die happy. I've only ever had two major dreams: to publish something I've written, and to sing in public, and so far I've done both. In Bangkok, L was asking me about my dreams and whether my parents' plans for me and the turbulence of my life had ever interfered with my pursuit of them.  No , I had to answer.  I wanted these things so badly that it didn't matter where I was, or what I was doing . Which is true; music and writing follow me around wherever I go, or maybe it is that I search them out the way animals hunt food. It is not so much that I rearrange my life to accommodate them; it's more that they are so much a part of me that I cannot go anywhere or do anything without bringing those two things into play.  Which goes to show, I suppose, that it's not at all a matter of how hard it is to achieve what you want; it's more a matter of how much you want it.

      I've finally found something I can do at the beach and have fun with, yay! This requires some explanation: although I have gone to the beach often in my short life on the pretext of a vacation, like any normal human being, apparently I belong to the teenyweeny subculture of humans who like the beach but hate sand and loathe bathing in the ocean. It makes perfect sense to me - sand is gritty and crumby and messy and gets into places that are extremely uncomfortable; the ocean has been the repository of the world's waste for aeons and is not fit to swim in for anything that is not a natural sea-dweller.  This of course brings us to the very obvious question, which E asked complete with befuddled look:  If you hate sand and don't swim in the ocean, what on earth do you do at the beach?  Plenty. I walk barefoot along the shore; I collect shells; I take pictures of the horizon; I build sandcastles; I slather myself with suntan lotion and wait for myself to tan.  Then , as I explained to an incredulous Laya,  I return to my hotel, brush off the sand on the concrete walk, and go swimming in the pool . Wild untamed beaches, quite obviously, hold no real allure for me.  Nevertheless, I went down to Pattaya this past weekend and enjoyed myself after a couple of false starts. Our first night there we went to Hard Rock for their foam party, but found it closed when we arrived (but to be fair - what normal club closes at midnight? I ask you). We then went to Palladium, where we bought a bottle of Johnnie Walker and watched with dismay as gay crossdressers who were ten times hotter than us (it's a sad world when gay men are hotter than real women) sang and danced onstage in very skimpy costumes. I consoled myself with the thought that they really sucked as singers - they sounded like cats mating, which is a very likely metaphor - but it did not make up for the fact that their waists were at least 5 inches smaller than mine. At some point I decided that I was not going to leave that benighted club without at least dancing, so I got up on one of the ledges and danced - to  The Ketchup Song , because it was the only one I could dance to.  (You may all disown me now.)  The next day we headed down for Jomtien Beach, picking up some glazed donuts along the way. Once we got there we ate again, stuffing ourselves with seafood (well, what else are you going to eat at the beach) and whiskey-spiked cokes. After a brief nap, we were off to play. My aunt suggested that we take a banana boat ride, and I agreed despite my misgivings. I really should learn to listen to my misgivings, because we fell off that stupid boat a grand total of - not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES.  Guess who had the hardest time getting back up on that blessed boat. I even tipped it over once, tossing everybody else back into the drink. It's a wonder they didn't just leave me there.  We got back completely drenched, with me sulking because I hadn't wanted to get wet and instead I'd gotten dunked so many times I was beginning to feel like a donut. My companions - not sharing my neurotic aversion for saltwater - decided to stay in the sea and swim, while I immediately headed for shore.  As soon as I got to shore, though, I caught sight of a jetski. L saw me eyeing it and asked  Do you know how to ride one?    No , I answered.  Do you?    No , he said. There was a brief pause before we turned to each other and asked, almost simultaneously,  Do you want to?    Definitely , I said,  But I want to go parasailing first.   So I went parasailing. They strapped me into a harness that was extremely tight, fastened a parachute to the harness, and then hooked me up to a rope tied to a boat. The boat started, went off, and up I went. It was splendid and wonderful and thrilling and breathtaking, and there are no words for being suspended high above the ocean, viewing it from a bird's vantage point. For moments I felt nearly like Icarus, just before he flew too high and melted his wings; and I understood what had made him go too close to the sun, even though it eventually killed him.  (Next activity: bungee jumping. Or skydiving.)  Once I touched down, I grabbed L and we went straight for the jetskis. It took them fifteen minutes to find me a jetski because apparently it was beyond their comprehension that a girl should want to ride alone. All the other women were passengers on their boyfriends' jetskis, but L and I were going to race so that wasn't an option. As it was, L took off without me, so when they finally let me loose on my own ride, he was already out in the deep.  I finally got my jetski and took off. Unfortunately, the jetski was harder to control than it looked - it took me a full five minutes to get it to stop moving around in circles. People were moving nervously out of my way - I must have looked like I was going to run them over, since I was leaning intently over the handlebars. Since I wasn't that sure of my navigational skills either, I decided to play safe and headed out to the open sea, where there was no one to run over.  Eventually I got the hang of it and went looking for L. He wasn't hard to find, even if I wasn't wearing my glasses - it's hard to miss a fair-skinned guy wearing purple from head to toe. I waved at him, he waved back, and we took off, skimming and bouncing across the waves. It's hard to tell who won - the spray would come back into our faces and we'd have to slow down to wipe it away - but we'd speed a full length one way, then do wide turns in opposite directions and do another length the other way.  I am currently paying for that fun, in the form of muscle pains in my arms and the back of my neck. Apparently handling a jetski takes more muscle than I comfortably have, and I'm going to carry these aches until I leave for KL on Wednesday.  That's less than two days away. I can hardly believe it; I've been here almost a month and it's all flown by so fast.  Bangkok, Bangkok, how I will miss you and the people I leave with you when I am gone.

      I am still in Bangkok, although currently in a remote part of it that I am not very familiar with. Whether this sounds believable or not, I am attending a seminar on Professional Training for Microfinance and Microentrepreneurship, and actually participating actively. My childhood spent tagging along after my father and reading his microfinance papers when I was bored has finally paid off; I've faked an entire groupful of microfinance professionals into thinking I'm one of them. That could be very very impressive or very very scary, depending on how you look at it.  (For the uninitiated: microfinance is one of the tools used in poverty alleviation programs. It centers primarily around providing easy access to credit/finance to poor people, as well as teaching them how to save and manage their finances. Okay, it's a lot more complicated than that, but I'm in an Internet cafe and I don't have time to explain.)  I am enjoying myself, strangely enough, although I'm exiting from the program before we start designing our own microfinance institutions - while I am pretty knowledgeable for a lay person, I am not *that* good. Poverty alleviation was something that interested me on a personal basis - the idea of doing something so grassroots, so directly beneficial to those who needed it, was very appealing. On the other hand, it was something my father was very involved in, and very good at - and I have never liked being referred to as "the daughter of". I am proud to be his daughter, but I am my own person and I like to be judged on my own merits. Had I entered the microfinance field, I would have remained "Mr. Quinones's daughter" for at least the first ten years of my practice; some of the current practitioners of microfinance in the region have worked with him ever since I was a child, and have watched me grow up. On the other hand, I am so interested that I might continue to do volunteer work in this field, just for the pure joy of it.  Am still roaming Bangkok, and remembering more everyday. I am so at home here that it is a little scary - I left Manila for two years and felt so out-of-place when I returned, and now I've returned to Bangkok after eight years and it still feels comfortable. There's still that office building where my old ballet school was, and the malls we used to go to, and of course Patpong (Thailand's infamous sex district), where we used to have to pass through to get to our grocery store. There's Swensen's bubblegum-flavored ice cream, and the King's Anthem played in public places, and familiar food being sold in the streets. My Thai remains, as ever, sadly fragmented, but as before, I can get around alone if need be.  I could make this my home if I chose to; I know people here and I have connections and I am comfortable with the culture and people. This leaves me at a crossroads, really. Recently I got news (from no less than three, count 'em, THREE people) that I'd passed the pre-qualifying exam for the Foreign Service. E was amused when I told him I was worried about passing; apparently he thinks there's no way I could fail. I wish I were as sure.  I  want  to pass, because everyone expects me to and I hate disappointing people. And yet if I pass, then that would leave me in a quandary: to live in the Philippines and pursue a career in the Foreign Service, or to go back to Bangkok and aggressively pursue a new career, or - and here's yet another thorn in my side - to follow my family to the US, where I have no idea what kind of job I'll end up in?  I have a feeling that the answer lies in how strong I really am.

      Am currently in Bangkok, rambling through my childhood haunts and realizing in the process that parts of my childhood were, indeed, surreal. A couple of nights ago I went out clubbing with D and L, people I used to go to kindergarten and grade school with. L's girlfriend and a friend of hers came along, and we shamelessly left them out. I would have felt guilty - we were unaccountably rude, although I danced with L's girlfriend and D tried to chat with them a couple of times - except, dude, I haven't seen these friends in what, almost ten years, so the guilt has been mainly overridden. We bought a bottle of Johnnie Walker and finished the whole thing, just the three of us (L's girlfriend and her friend stuck to beer), and D and L had to carry me out to the car and up to my room.  Then yesterday L came over, teasing me about how completely trashed I'd gotten the night before; I thwapped him across the head and we went to MBK to get me cheap cheap glasses because I keep on losing them.  Rule of thumb , L pointed out,  It's the expensive stuff you lose. What do you want to bet that this cheapass pair is the one you're going to keep until the day you turn 30?   After that L and I went around looking at comic figurines while his girlfriend tagged along in the background, looking bewildered. I admit that comic figurines - horrifically realistic reproductions of Spawn nightmares, for example - are not typical feminine pursuits, but when 80% of your friends are guys, it is hard to squoosh in time for makeup and shoes. Thankfully I manage to do so anyway, and at any rate the fact that I wear high heels and lipstick does not detract from my enjoyment of comic books and action movies.  After dinner, L's girlfriend asked - would I like to go dancing? And I said yes, since I am always up for an excuse to kick up my heels. We ended up on Silom, and I mentioned to L that  Oh, this reminds me of Patpong!  - Thailand's infamous sex district, which was also next door to the apartment I lived in when I was younger.  L grinned and said  Patpong's right down the street, wanna go?  So we took off, L's girlfriend trailing behind us in confusion (what would you think, indeed, if your boyfriend and his pseudo-sister took off for your city's sex district while giggling madly and saying stuff in a language you didn't understand very well) but being a good sport about it, overall. It was like a walk down a very surreal memory lane - our old supermarket was still there, with minimal changes; L and I walked down the aisles, laughing like lunatics when we found the places where we'd used to pluck out candies and ice cream and cheese and yogurt. Then we strolled around Patpong on general principle, and I kept on pointing to random go-go bars and saying  L, dude, Cleopatra's Go-Go Bar is still here! And that massage parlor, I remember that being here before!  They'd taken down some of the signs and blinking neon lights, which L and I discussed with disappointment, but all in all it was still pretty much the same. No one believes me when I tell them I have fond childhood memories of Patpong, but last night I went back there and all at once I was six again, tugging on my mom's hand and wondering why we couldn't go in and watch the pretty ladies dancing naked on top of tables.  I feel safe here, strangely enough. D and L and I had an informal convention on how we'd found life in Manila, and came to the general consensus that it was wild and fun and - strangely - painful. We've lost one of our old group - she cracked and ran off to Cebu with her band, and hasn't returned since - and a lot of us managed to tumble into bad habits which we are still recovering from today. We talked relationships as well, and I thought I'm so glad  I'm their friend and not their girlfriend , because - I don't know why, but we have all turned out to be inordinately cruel in terms of falling in love, because none of us have yet, not really. Last night I lay awake thinking of how easy it is for me to play with people, and wondering if I'm doing the same thing in my relationships.  Tell me if you're serious,  I said once.  In the name of our friendship, tell me if you're serious. Because if you are, I'll take you seriously. Otherwise I'm going to assume that all you want to do is play, and just because I'm younger than you are doesn't mean I don't know the game.   I wonder whether they take me seriously. I hope they do, because I am meeting the child I was and reconciling her to the girl/woman I am now, and there are parts of her that are not pretty.  I can be cruel,  Tori sang,  I don't know why.   Although I do know why, and the fact of the matter is that money can in no ways be considered protection. In some ways, our group - protected and pampered as we all were - is much more streetwise than people who actually grew up on the street. In our defense, we are trying to use what we have for a good purpose, but we are also trying to survive at the same time.

      What kind of story can you write with the words 'white', 'uterus', and 'suicide'?  Yeah, I was afraid so. This should teach me not to accept challenges from any of my friends, because - as I have noted several times before - I don't have any normal ones.  I set aside the whole of yesterday to watch two movies that I've been wanting to watch for quite a while -  Bad Boys 2 , to indulge my inner guy; and  The Debut , a small-budget indie film about a Filipino-American community that won the San Diego Asian Film Festival. The first movie was, as expected, entertaining; I will not criticize technical weaknesses or plot wonkiness because anyone who watches an action film for the intellectual stimulus should have his head examined. (Girls who watch action films for the romance that is usually thrown in as a sop to the female audience should be similarly examined.)  It was the second movie that grabbed me, that walked into my head and heart and stayed there. It was hilarious and touching and managed to strike several very sensitive points with me; the people in the movie could have been my sister, my godbrother, my mother, people I know in the US - why beat around the bush? They could have been me.  A short synopsis would, I think, be helpful. Ben, the boy through whose eyes the film's story is told, is a Filipino-American boy who was born in the Philippines but was brought to the US when he was very young, and has lived there ever since. He has no memories of the Philippines. He cannot speak the language, and knows very little of its culture. He hangs out almost exclusively with his Caucasian-American friends, and never brings them home because he is embarrassed that his house always smells of fish. He wants to be an artist; his father wants him to study medicine. To top it all off, he is being forced to go to his sister's debutante party (an event exclusive to the local Filipino-American community), which is being held on the same night as the coolest senior party of the year. Ben is, in short, a boy who is torn between nature and nurture - trying to find that happy balance between the conflicting demands of his Filipino ethnicity and his American upbringing.  An amazing range of issues are covered in the film; if you are Filipino and have lived any amount of time somewhere other than the Philippines, you cannot help but recognize some of the situations that crop up. From Ben's conflicted relationship with his father to his friends' reactions to the ubiquitous giant spoon and fork that hang in the dining room, everything has a tinge of the familiar. The theater was near-empty, which was a blessing, as I found myself laughing out loud often, most of the time due to moments of surprised self-recognition. The gatherings around basketball courts and the sideline flirtations and conversations; the family friend who feels as if she is on a higher social level than anyone else and uses the occasion to flaunt herself; the Filipino kids who dance traditional folk dances and modern freestyle with the same grace and ease - I have been to these gatherings. I know these people. I am them.  Passing through PowerBooks as I whiled away time between movies, I came across the latest issue of Time, which featured a cover story on  urlLink Asian diaspora  - people of Asian descent who have since migrated elsewhere, and are struggling to find their roots. They wrote of displacement, of the feeling of being suspended between worlds, of their efforts to reconnect with - or disconnect from, as the case may be - the cultures and people they had left behind. Monique Truong spoke of the hostility and resentment she and other Vietnamese-Americans encountered whenever they returned, how hard it was to go home and how a small guilty part of her no longer saw Vietnam as home. Jessica Hagedorn spoke of how her memories of the Philippines were no longer real; places and people she remembered from her childhood had long changed, or moved, or been replaced.    Home is inside me , one of them wrote, after describing his efforts to search for home in his birthplace, in his parents' birthplace, in the place he had grown up, and the various places he had lived. It was a common thread that ran through the various stories, although they had come from different countries and faced different problems. Eventually each one had come to a realization that they could not point to a place on a map and identify it as home, because home consisted of their memories, their family, the various places and cultures they had absorbed throughout their lifetimes. I think I can sum it up even more neatly than they did:  I  am home.  (I don't know, or understand exactly, why I keep harping on this theme, and currently I'm mapping out an article that will hopefully let me lay this issue to rest. Is it the impending move to the US? Is it the recent travel jag, which saw me hopping across three cities - all of which have emotional significance to me - in less than three months? Is it my involvement with E, which more and more make me realize how transient my life has been, especially compared to his and the lives of people like him?)  E told me once that he supposed that I wouldn't find home until I started a family of my own.  They'll ground you,  he theorized, sounding eerily like my parents and my aunt, who insisted that should I enter a relationship, I would have to give up my wandering ways and settle down.  Why does it have to be that way?  I asked my mother.  Why do I have to be the one who gives so much up? Why can't the guy be the one who goes with me?   For a while, I suppose, I believed them - that I was, essentially, a girl without a country, and that a steady relationship would settle me down. Two days ago, I changed my mind.  Two days ago, I was in UP. Rendered irrational and restless by first-day cramps, searching for a quiet place to sit and try out the supposed benefits of Midol, I ended up on the steps of the Main Library. As I had feared, once I sat down I lost the desire to get up again, and had to resign myself to staying there for a few hours. Twilight fell while I was sitting there, bored and high on the effects of Midol. In the gentle dark, I happened to glance across the road into the UP Lagoon, and caught a glimpse of a family of fireflies, out for their daily dance.  I don't know how long I watched them. A fine drizzle came and went, and people passed by on their busy way to Somewhere Else, as I sat there. One firefly - the group's black sheep, no doubt - broke free from the bunch and came daringly close to where I was sitting, shimmering flirtatiously at me. And it was then - for some strange reason - that I relaxed and let go. Like I said, I am home. I cannot be a stranger to places that offer me moments like those with the fireflies - moments of strange, delicious whimsy and wonder - and I know I will find places like that no matter where I am.

      One week has never been so long.  I spent this past week reviewing - let's make that *trying* to review - for the written Foreign Service Exams. I managed to get my hands on two - count 'em again, folks, TWO - textbooks on the global political economy, and finally managed to read through the first chapter of one of the books two days before the actual exam. The night before the exam, I panicked, turned on CNN, and refused to let anyone change the channel. After my eyes had started crossing from absolute boredom, I logged on to the Internet and, after aimlessly surfing through half the webpages ever created, turned to the BBC page and facepalmed when I saw the Philippines' faux mutiny being intelligently mocked on its front page.  After that, I inexplicably lost the desire to study international events.  As for what actually happened during the exam, it is a story in and of itself.    Day One  Otherwise known as  The Beginning is the End is the Beginning , courtesy of the erstwhile Smashing Pumpkins. With the full knowledge that I live approximately two hours away from the testing center, I allowed my insomnia to take over me, resulting in my only being able to have three hours of sleep before I had to drag myself out of bed, get dressed, and ooze toward the door. My cousin, bless his heart, had volunteered to take me to the testing center because he knows I am directionally-challenged; we drove to the nearest MRT station, fought our way on (in the Philippines everything, including public transport, is nasty and brutish but not quite short) and remained in exhausted silence all the way to our destination. Once there we got off and hopped onto a jeep that would pass by the road leading to the testing center; I will abbreviate this passage by not bitching about having to inhale pollutants and toxins at such an early hour. We took a tricycle - that is what it's called, although it does not in any way resemble a three-wheeled bike; rather, it is a tiny metal cage attached to a motorbike, which is supposed to serve as part of public transportation in the Philippines (You may admire our survival skills now.) - the rest of the way, and in this undignified manner I arrived at the first day of my exam.  The exams began at 9AM, although we had been strictly instructed to arrive at 8AM, as the doors - according to the admission pass - would be closed by then. Since this is the Philippines, 8AM was loosely translated into "oh, 8:15 or thereabouts, don't let's be too nitpicky about a minute here and there" and the doors *were* finally closed at 8:30. We were lectured by confident, smiling proctors who annoyed us with their very cheerfulness; what right had they to smile when (a) it was so godforsakenly early and (b) they were not the ones on the wrong end of this stupid exam? The first exam, they said, would be English.  Just breathe , said one of the proctors.  Oxygen in your brain allows you to think better .  It also allows you to live, but I restrained my inner smartass and tried not to tremble. The airconditioning, by the way, had been set to "Inner Antarctica". Apparently working at the Department of Foreign Affairs turns you into a penguin.  The English exam went by execrably fast; I took issue with several questions that contained grammatical errors, but restrained myself from editing my exam questionnaire. We took a break for lunch, but I was too nervous to leave the building so I stayed inside instead with all the other examinees who were also too nervous to leave the building.  Second half: International Relations. The first question was a long-winded, unintelligible question about either the US invasion of Iraq, or the UN response to the situation, or the general state of international terrorism, I'm not really sure. I spent two hours answering that question and ended up giving short, blunt answers to the others. One question asked for five or six transnational issues that were burningly relevant in our time. After contagions and international terrorism, my mind went blank.  It was, naturally, drizzling when I left the testing center. I walked straight down the road, saw a taxi, and got in. The driver, who turned out to be on a break, was initially reluctant to bring me anywhere:  Miss , he begged,  Just take a jeep .  I was too exhausted and out-of-sorts to debate with him.  Manong, PLEASE , I said crisply, in the tone of one who is at the end of her rope. He took one look at me through his rear-view mirror and gave in.   Day Two   Since I had collapsed into bed the night before at 9, I woke up in relatively better spirits. I got down in plenty of time to eat breakfast; my aunt gave me a cup of coffee and asked how I was going to get to the testing center.  Oh, Cousin M's taking me , I said confidently. She went off to wake him, then returned to tell me that he'd said he wasn't taking me anywhere.  I could not mock his ancestors because they happen to be the same as mine, so I satisfied myself with shaking my fist in the general direction of his room. Faced with no other choice, I walked out and caught a taxi instead. Miraculously, I got to the testing center without any major mishaps.  And then promptly wished I'd stayed home.  The first test of the day was Filipino. When they gave the signal to begin the exam, I turned the questionnaire over praying that it would not be unnecessarily cruel. Somewhere in the places where prayers are received and transmitted to the proper departments, the word "not" was omitted. The first part of the exam was vocabulary, consisting of five words - none of which I had ever seen or heard of in my entire life, and was doubting even really existed. The second part - translation, or pagsasalin, where we were asked to translate a literary passage and a news article into Filipino. The third part was an essay with a hopelessly ambiguous type of topic. I wasted two minutes when I laid my head down on my desk and indulged in a silent scream.  After mangling my native language, I went off to lunch - this time deciding that I wasn't going to be a chicken, I was going to leave the building. I had trouble leaving through the gate; apparently two of the policemen assigned to patrol the area had gotten a crush on me and kept on insisting that they would escort me to lunch. With my luck, however, I would probably have been mistaken as a dangerous criminal en route to jail, so I politely declined.  A mistake, as it turned out, since I really have no head for direction. I ended up walking down half of Roxas Boulevard, getting honked at by three-fourths of the taxis in Manila, while getting odd looks from the local vagrant psychotics. You know you're doing something wrong when even the nuts think you're crazy. So I turned around and marched right back in the opposite direction, and found McDonald's.  Back to the exam room after lunch. I forgot to mention that this time I'd been smart and brought a jacket - only to find out I didn't really need it, since someone had already complained about the room temp and they'd turned down the a/c. God works in mysterious ways, indeed; I have trouble trying to decipher what exactly He's doing with my life.  The proctor took the opportunity to terrify us a little before passing out the exams. It was on Philippine Conditions, and  It's 30 percent of the examination , she said impressively. Which was a big thing, since the written exams were broken up into 6 parts; English, International Relations and World History were 20 percent each, Foreign Language and Filipino were 5 percent each, and Philippine Conditions - 30 percent. I trembled in my seat; I had done no reviewing at all on this topic except a brief glance through the 1987 Constitution the night before.  The questionnaire had 6 questions - horrors - but all of them were remarkably humble questions, asking the examinee to comment on one situation or another. I took the opportunity to bitch - albeit diplomatically - about various aspects of Philippine government, not the least of which was their seemingly perpetual lack of funds for what they insist are *important* projects. After two hours of happy, enthusiastic scribbling, I turned in 10 pages of thinly disguised aggrieved-citizen-whining.  I danced out of the exam room that afternoon.   Day Three   My cousin drove me all the way to the testing center, making me retract my previous fist-shaking. I went in - again, with a wildly thumping heart - because this was another portion of the exam I had not reviewed for at all. The night before I had made a pathetic attempt to download information on World History, but was taken aback at the sheer immensity of the information available. Most started with  Since the dawn of humankind ...  and were not at all attractive to a last-minute crammer.  Don't look so worried, the proctor said, still cheerfully (what is *wrong* with our government officials, I ask of you). It's very easy. I briefly considered the wisdom of taking off my sneaker and throwing it at her - I have very good aim when it comes to throwing shoes at people - but reason prevailed. The questionnaires were passed out. I eyed them with fear and loathing. I turned mine over with extreme caution, and peeked at the questions.  There were two, and they were incredibly cute. The first one -   Discuss the prospects of ASEAN achieving borderless regional integration similar to that of the EU   elicited a squeal from me; it was so  kawaii  I wanted to pinch its cheeks. My desired answer:  Not in this lifetime, sweetie . It took me three pages to elaborate exactly why not, but the words "not in this lifetime" did indeed make it into my concluding paragraph.  The second one was even cuter -  Discuss world events which have led to the great influence that the US currently wields over the destinies of most countries , etc. etc. How adorable. If they were expecting me to discuss this in the light of recent unilateral action taken versus Iraq, they were sorely disappointed. I hate to be predictable.  Lunch, again prefaced with trying to avoid the moon-eyed policemen. I finished early and spent some time wandering around the local shops while I waited for the rain to ease; when it didn't, I took the plunge and walked back to the testing center anyway. As Philippine superstition has it that you will multiply if you get caught in the rain, I was the only one doing so.  Foreign Language was the last exam of the day - the last exam of the lot. They told us that out of the hundreds that had taken the first set of exams, only a hundred remained - ninety in Manila, which would have been us, and ten in Cebu. I stared at them and wished very very hard for a stiff shot of vodka.  Everything was going fine until I reached one of the sections -  Write about yourself - your hobbies, your family, your likes and dislikes. You may include descriptions of your school or your job and your friends. Use about 100 words . The instructions, as everything else in that exam, were in Spanish, which had been my selected foreign language. I paused, composing a short, simple essay in my mind - and then glanced back down at my paper, rereading the instructions. Something caught my eye that I had not previously noticed -  Note , the instructions said.  Please use fictitious names and dates .  Whereupon I went slightly insane. I do not know how the people at the DFA will take this, but I introduced myself as a 25-year-old man called Antonio de la Cruz, the only son of parents who had only one child because they didn't want a big family. Tonio, as he calls himself, is lonely so he keeps many pets - two dogs, three cats, and an anaconda. He likes to read, write, and play the guitar. He is trying to learn how to sing so he can get a girlfriend. He thinks he has no girlfriend because he is fat. He also has no friends.  At this point, I think I've pretty much given up on passing the exam - they would have to be insane to let me in - but oh, the fun I had. The results are coming out mid-October, but you know what? I really, really, really don't care.  I'm just glad it's over.

      This morning, talking in his car in the stealthy twilight:   You scare me,  he said, leaning back against his seat and half-closing his eyes.  You can't be pinned down.    That's not my fault,  I said, but without conviction. I understood what he was saying.  After a few hours of sleep, I understand even better. Understanding doesn't help.

      You find the strangest things when you go in search of your roots. I spent last night in my maternal grandmother's hometown, in the house where she was raised by my great-great-grandparents. There I found people who had known - not only my mother, but my grandmother and my great-grandfather from childhood. I stayed in a house that had been the meeting place of generals during the second World War. I slept in the room once occupied by my great-great-grandparents, now occupied by my great-grandfather's youngest sister.  This morning we went on a quick tour of my grandmother's hometown. I saw the town park, recently converted into a parking lot; the bakery at which she had used to buy her bread, and from which we bought bread again that morning; the church that marked the turning to what my mother referred to as the family house. In the light of day, my great-great-aunt showed me the family photographs, yellowed and stained with age.  This is your great-grandmother , she said, pointing to a solemn-faced girl in one picture.  She was your age when this picture was taken. It was the last picture we have of her, because she died soon after .  I looked at the photo and could not look away - the girl in the photo had my face, or perhaps it is the other way around.  Mother, look , I said, because my mother was distracted by other things in the house that represented happy childhood memories for her.  I have my great-grandmother's face .  It's strange to realize that I come from somewhere. It has always been difficult to trace my roots, particularly because my predecessors were as nomadic as my family is now. My maternal grandparents were from different towns in the same province; their seven children were born in seven different cities all over the Philippines. My paternal grandfather was a transplant from Cebu, the illegitimate offspring of a Cebuana and a landowner's son from Negros Oriental; my paternal grandmother hailed from the southernmost tip of the Philippines, in the area now well-known for its terrorist activity. They met and married in Northern Mindanao; they left the town where my father was born after a bad accident ruined my grandfather's business, and moved to the town where my parents eventually met and began dating.  For my sister and I - transplants of a transplant - discovering our roots is as exciting and exotic as trekking through jungles. This morning I discovered that I have my great-grandmother's face, with only a small mark near my chin to differentiate my face from hers. My sister's build and walk are eerily similar to my father's older sister's. Disposition-wise, she could be my paternal great-grandmother reincarnated. My extended arms are crooked, a trait shared by other members of my maternal family; my sister's fair skin is courtesy of our paternal great-grandfather's Spanish roots. We are an amalgamation of our past, of all these people and histories, and yet we are us - individual and independent.  Sometimes I touch my face, or look at the curve of my arms, or run my hands through the thickness of my hair, and think: I have my great-grandmother's face, my mother's arms, my grandmother's thick black hair. I can tell you my history, my family's stories, simply by cataloguing myself and the pieces of me that I can trace back to my antecedents. Sometimes I look back, wondering who I would be now, what I would have done, where I could have travelled, if my history had been different. Would I still be rei, strange fruit of a strange tree, if my parents had never left their backwoods of a village and I had grown up knowing nothing but fields? Would my thoughts run like this, what kind of people would I have had as friends, what would I have done to amuse myself, who would I have fallen in love with?  In my fiercest hopes, I am who I am no matter which historical variable is tweaked: rei the barefoot peasant girl, rei the Quezon City dweller, rei the urbanite dweller of Bangkok, rei the hip inhabitant of California, rei the sophisticated expatriate child of Brazil or Rome. Again and again, I run the scenarios through my head, and I am brought to the same conclusion. I cannot imagine being anyone but who I am now - revised slightly, perhaps, or with a different vocabulary or linguistic style - but still me, down at the core.  Like I said, you find the strangest things when you go in search of your roots. You find a host of other people, crowded into your eyes and skin and hair and the shape of your body and the way you walk. Mostly, though, if you look hard enough and long enough, you find yourself.

      Happy Thanksgiving, first and foremost. There are many things I am grateful for, and there is not enough space to list them, but:  Thank God for my family, and the practical, regretless way we dismantle each home and set up anew. With them, I have learned how to accept what cannot be changed with dignity and humor; how to peel back mundanity and routine to find the extraordinary, the breathtaking, the quirky; how to live in the  now , and to take responsibility for what I have chosen, and not to waste my time regretting might-have-beens.  Thank God for my country, such as it is - for teaching me how to give; for forcing me to look past preconceived notions of love and patriotism and citizenship, and redefining them; for reminding me that art and music and culture are ways of reinventing what cannot be accepted, of rebelling without destroying.  Thank God for the people I love, have loved and fallen in love with, and the things they have taught me - that it is alright to cry, and make mistakes; the quirks and oddities of Philippine culture, which I would have never learned otherwise; how to negotiate the gap between who you are and who another person is, and how enjoyable that process can be.   Thank God for sparkly things and dark red silk-covered pillows, because they are as balm to a soul that has been rubbed raw by life in general, and ugly floral prints in particular.  Most of all, thank God for my sense of humor and for the people who tolerate (and instigate) it, because without it I would be another statistic, another quitter.  Of course I'm thankful for things such as food and education and a roof over my head as well, but these things are the cake. I give thanks daily for my cake; I am fortunate enough to be able to save my gratitude over the icing and the sugar flowers for Thanksgiving. So I do.  Now, as for Christmas: I was thinking of writing a short story as a present for my friends, and have been brainstorming ever since. However, I do not know whether this would be a good gift, or whether it is simply self-serving (i.e., the inflicting of my torturous prose on a captive audience). In any case, I have a few more weeks to think about it, and if there are any helpful suggestions, I'm open.

      It's been three years, five months, and ten days.  Sometimes I'm angry, and I don't know whether I'm angry at that guy in particular, or at guys in general for being so cheap. Why do so many men ask so little of women? Why are they so easily satisfied with a glimpse of skin and a blowjob? Why are they so convinced they've gotten the best of the deal when in fact they're walking away with nothing at all?

      So, I was thinking this afternoon, as I was waiting for Solemate to show up, it's been a long time since I've done political commentary. Pretty disgraceful for a former polisci major, especially one who lives in a country where political near-disaster happens almost everyday. What did I say before?  You'd have to be a hermit or dead to be bored in the Philippines  or something to that effect.   Actually, that's far from the truth. Since I arrived here a few months ago, we've had several more 'domestic disturbances' - a rather lame attempt to impeach the Chief Justice that brought the country to a bewildered standstill (a 'constitutional crisis', the papers called it, but in reality it was something a little stupider than that); an aborted attempt to capture NAIA's control tower; an anti-government rally in our central business district, staged by people who were paid PhP300 (That's about USD5.50) to act like angry citizens; our president and virtually the entire cabinet falling over themselves to get the autograph of a Taiwanese soap star; a Chinese-Filipino woman kidnapped and killed in a shockingly brutal manner, and the entire Chinese-Filipino community up in arms as a result.   I think I understand now why - and how - I could e-mail my friends in the Philippines, asking frantically  What's going on? Are you guys okay?  only to receive confused  Of course we're okay, what's the matter? -type replies. It's a little like moving into a house with roommates who are incurably messy. The first few months you're stressed out of your mind because there are clothes hanging off of doorknobs and half-empty jars of food on the table and unidentifiable objects strewn on the floor. After a while you get tired of picking up after people, or trying to enforce your standards of cleanliness, and just kind of ignore the mess as you head straight for your own room, which is organized to your satisfaction. There comes a point in time when you expect empty chip packets to crackle under your feet, when you automatically move to the left to avoid the pile of books in the middle of the floor, when you absently reach out to brush the sofa clean before you sit down. Then you go to other people's houses and see how clean they are, how neatly everything is kept, how pretty their curtains are.   You get to the point where nothing, not even the great relationship you have with your roomies, can get you to stay in that house  one second longer . That's pretty much where we are, or where we're headed right now. That's why it's becoming easier and easier for people to leave, for my generation to abdicate their positions of leadership before they have inherited them, to wipe their shoes on their history on their way out.   Like I said, I wanted to do political commentary. But there's so much to write about, and so much I want to explain and analyze and say. It's like asking a person  what's wrong with your house? Give me a list of the problems and we'll analyze what's going on and try to fix it.   And you start off by saying  Well for one thing, it's upside down.    Sometimes there's really nothing to say, after that.

      Adventures for the asking, and some not even asked for. Last week I met up with A - who from hereon will be referred to as Solemate, since that is what we call each other in real life - to work on some research we're doing for an NGO. Not exactly the job we dreamed of doing when we were in college, but then again, working is like writing - sometimes you enjoy it, sometimes you just do it for the money. (Incidentally, Moliere compared writing to sex, but I thought I'd be a little more circumspect.)  We met up, had lunch, ended up talking about our dreams (literal dreams, the kind you have after you fall asleep), and then took off to go to Quezon City Hall, where we planned to gather some information on our research topic.  How do we get to Quezon City Hall?  Solemate asked as soon as we crossed the flyover to the other side of Philcoa. Not being a genius at commuting and directions in general, myself, I stared at her blankly for a few minutes before turning back to survey the fleet of jeeps that passed blithely by. C's advice on how to get to places entered my head:  You look at the signboards,  she instructed.  Find one that has the name of the place you want to go on it, like Megamall or Cubao or whatever. Then you get on it, tell the driver to take you to your destination, and then get off when he tells you to. Simple.    But what if I don't see any jeeps or buses with signboards that have my destination's name on it?  I asked.  C's forehead wrinkled a little in thought, a few seconds before she brightened.  Well, then,  she said philosophically,  You'll just have to change your plans and go to somewhere that they have signboards for.   That advice in mind, I told Solemate:  We're going to get on a jeep that says CITY HALL, it's going to take us to city hall, and we'll get off.    Okay,  Solemate said, and we immediately hopped onto the first jeep with a signboard saying "City Hall". Now: the journey from Philcoa to City Hall is not complicated. It is a 5 minute trip along a single road; you get on at one point and you get off at another - a perfectly curvilinear transaction. However, Solemate and I are not particularly gifted at directions, and somehow managed to get lost - twice - before finally giving up and walking to city hall.  This is so stupid,  Solemate grumbled, adjusting her umbrella to block our faces from the sun.  We graduated from the best university in this stupid country, how the heck did we get lost?    God is fair,  I pointed out, concentrating on not losing sight of city hall and, heaven forbid, getting lost again.  He gave us so much brains that He figured the homing instincts could go to someone else.   At city hall, our eyes were opened to two things: first, that apparently no one in city hall is aware of what anyone outside of their own department is doing; second, that very few people in city hall actually work. One woman, dressed nattily in the city hall uniform, was apparently employed solely to push elevator buttons - which she did with much attitude. Other employees were diligently occupied in the pursuit of their own happiness, in the form of informal little coffee klatches, newspapers, measuring their children for graduation outfits, filling out application forms for loans ... Solemate, viewing the building-ful of people busily employed in doing everything BUT the tasks listed in their respective job descriptions, shook her head and expressed her gratitude that she did not pay taxes to the Quezon City government.  We headed back to Philcoa under cover of a drizzling rain, arguing amiably about the precise Tagalog term for that particular type of precipitation. At Philcoa, a bare two minutes after we got down, I felt a hand running down my butt - and it wasn't mine OR Solemate's. I whirled, smacking the arm away and getting ready to pound the groper's face - only to find myself looking straight into the maddened eyes of one of the vagrant psychotics who wander the streets of Manila.   A security guard, spotting my dilemma, blew his whistle and hollered at the man, just in time to keep him from trying to hit me with the bundle of twigs he held in his hand. Solemate, confused and alarmed at the speed with which I dragged her away and into safer realms, asked what had happened, and I told her.  Omigod,  she said, her eyes widening.  Solemate, that's so scary.   I looked at her, and we collapsed against a wall, laughing in nervous reaction.  It was scary,  I admitted,  but also funny as hell. My gosh, solemate, can we not go anywhere without weird stuff happening?   I've been told that I'm far from normal, but I beg to disagree. You cannot blame the goldfish if the aquarium is strange - and you must admit, it is a strange strange world we live in.

      I lost my phone a couple of days ago - or maybe it was stolen, I'm not quite sure which. All I know is that one minute it was safely tucked away in the depths of my bag and the next it was simply Not There. Quite existentialist, really. I came home extremely upset over its loss; there was a moment of confusion wherein my mother and I had to clarify  who  exactly had the right to be the most upset over the situation. I won, naturally, since it was after all  my  phone in all senses of the word, and my mother's only claim to misfortune was the fact that she could no longer contact me at all hours of the day and night, regardless of my location.  It's been a silent two days, during which I've learned that yes, it's true, you can actually grieve for the loss of inanimate objects. Right now I am in the denial phase of Kubler-Ross's five stages; I still grope sleepily under my pillow to switch off my phone's alarm, and perk up, my ears tingling, when I hear a tone that roughly approximates the message tone of my former cellphone. Yesterday C and I were hanging out on the lanai, bemoaning the loss of my phone;  I miss it so much,  I mourned.  I miss picking it up and playing with it or checking its calendar to see if I had anything scheduled for the day.    I miss your phone too,  C said, glumly.  I had so much fun taking pictures of myself with it.   The most annoying thing about it all is that it is not even practical for me to buy myself a replacement phone; we are moving very soon and as C pointed out, I might as well just get a phone after we've moved. In the meantime, I am phoneless and have instructed all my friends to contact me either through e-mail and house phone. None of them, I imagine, are very pleased about the inconvenience of it all.  And I cannot imagine why I have devoted an entire post to a cellphone. Perhaps I am more materialistic than I thought I was.   Oh, but I honestly do miss my phone.

      Thinking about paradigms, and frameworks, and viewpoints. Someone once said that in a way, prejudice is a way of life - depending on how you choose to see things, you will always automatically classify certain things as bad, or wrong. This isn't bad, in and of itself; it's merely a way of classifying the world you live in, ordering it so that you can make decisions more efficiently. Prejudice becomes ugly when people refuse to change their existing set of values and beliefs in the face of either (a) evidence to the contrary or (b) a fundamental change in their situation that renders the basis of those previous judgements wrong.  For example - to use a fairly frivolous example - I am highly prejudiced against the color orange. I do not like it, I loathe it, I think people who wear it who are not either forced to wear it (like prisoners) or paid to wear it (like say, models?) have something fundamentally wrong with their powers of color perception. This bias is fine, so long as I realize that my anti-orange sentiments apply only to me and my personal wardrobe. When I pick up a weapon and start gunning for anyone who dares wear orange in my presence, that's when you know I'm two beans short of an espresso. Prejudice, in a way, is a kind of psychosis - a refusal to accept reality as it is, rather than the way it is inside your head.   Anyway. Like I was saying, I was thinking of paradigms, of the value/belief structure that accompany them, and of the massive disorientation that occurs during a paradigm shift. We may be in the midst of a major one here in the Philippines - or at least, I hope so. It would be a positive explanation for all the instability that's been going on lately. Just this year, there was that Hollywoodized attempt at a coup at the Oakwood Towers, led by young, buff mutineers who tattooed the symbol of a secret society onto their arms and carried high-tech weaponry (ultimate phallic symbols, yo). Tourists lined up around the barrier watching and taking pictures, and fangirls hovered around the barriers, squeeing about how cute they were (I kid you not). It says something about our culture that even our mutineers get fangirled. They claimed they had "solid proof" of corruption in the higher ranks and would present it to the public "in due time". Once in front of the Senate Committee, however, they refused to show their so-called proof, insisted on reading from a prepared statement, and - this irks me the most -  walked out  on the hearing when the Senate asked them to set aside the statement until they'd addressed the matter at hand, which was  their hearing .   Then there was the impeachment attempt on our Chief Justice, which turned out to be more of a three-ring circus than anything else. I will not list the details here because that would take too long and be too confusing to anyone who is not well-conversed in the oddities of Philippine socio-political life. (I was looking for links to information on the whole shebang, but of course all articles are highly skewed to reflect the leanings of the writer.) Let it suffice to say, though, that the whole country was held spellbound for two weeks while our Congress revealed their massive insecurity complex about their role vis-a-vis that of the judiciary and the Senate; while learned lawmakers and legal eagles debated hotly over the practical applications of the phrase "to file" [a motion to impeach]; while incensed court employees threatened to take to the streets in a mass strike, although no one really knew whether the ones striking were for or against the impeachment because both factions issued similar threats.   What else, what else? About a month back there was a rally in our central business district - a rather highly-publicized event, given that it was held on one of the main thoroughfares of the area (think: rally along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan or Jalan Ampang in Kuala Lumpur). The rallyists, however, were rather unconvincing people; apparently they had been hired to man the protest for the day, at a rate of PhP300 (that's about USD 5.50) per person, plus free lunch. The protesters had come appropriately prepared, with pots, pans, bottles of water, and their children. They were not particularly interested in the political or economic implications of their actions; as far as they were concerned, they were being paid to be there and that's what they were doing.  Around the same time there was an attempt to take over the control tower of our international airport. Coming so close on the heels of the last mutiny attempt, our local armed forces took decisive action: they stormed the tower and summarily executed the ringleader with a hail of bullets. To add to the drama, the ringleader was, at the time of his death, giving an  interview  on the radio as to the reasons behind his actions. His final gasps were heard, live on air. The family and grandstanding members of the media accused the government of overkill, tearfully pointing out the bullet-ridden body of their relative and insisting that he was a wonderful person who had not deserved to die that way. The government, for once, did not back down. There were no apologies, no demands for inquiries into the incident, no removals of high-ranking officials.   What a year it's been, and I haven't even mentioned half of what's happened. Currently we're in the initial stages of election fever, with everyone hanging on tenterhooks for the next developments of the upcoming presidential race. Our incumbent president has disappointed and outraged the nation by declaring that she will run "for the good of the country", not six months after she had declared that she would  not  run, so as to avoid politicking. She is being contested by a very outspoken former Education Secretary with a penchant for floral shirts; a movie star who is the local equivalent of Elvis who has not really made up his mind to run, but is being fielded anyway by a local party; the former head of the Philippine National Police, who has been accused of killing a bunch of suspected kidnappers in cold blood, and is suspected to be in cahoots with them; and, more recently, a pastor who heads the nation's largest born-again Christian movement. Naturally there are also the usual slew of nuisance candidates, among which is a man who claims to be the "Messiah of all Earth Heroes". You can imagine how avidly I await the presidential debates.   Like I said, I used to see these things as nothing more than static - on a television whose antenna was broken and there were no channels to switch to. I wanted desperately to change channels, to change antennae, to throw the damn TV out and get a new one. Up to some point, I still do; there is only so much a human being can take before she loses her sense of dignity and pride. But slowly I'm coming to look at these things as the disruption period between the existing situation and the emerging one. You can't build a new house without tearing the old one down first. You can't make improvements or install change without undergoing some kind of discomfort.   Maybe I'm wrong, but I want so badly to think that there's some sort of point to this - to the fear and anger and self-contempt I see daily in the faces of my people, the way they slouch and shuffle their way through life, the way they put their trust in celluloid heroes because there are no longer any real-life ones. I want my people to have pride again, to be human, to treat each other with respect and acceptance. I want to know that the next generation - my generation's children - will have a culture to inherit, footsteps to follow in, positions to fill and gainful employment to occupy themselves with. I'm coming so close to the time when it will no longer be  my  future, but the next generation's - and I do not want them to look at me with disappointed eyes, telling me without words that I have left them nothing to dream for.   My paradigm is shifting. I am stepping forward. If there is anything I have learned in the past two weeks, it is that my hands may be small, but they are doing something.   For everyone, and most especially for me, an excerpt from a Cowboy Junkies song:   Hold on honey, there's a new dawn coming / And a big bird to sweep it away / Are you born yet? / Are you listening? / Are you sick of staring at the walls? / Are you hungry? / Are you angry? / Are you wondering if there's anyone at all?  Hold on honey, there's a new dawn coming / And a big bird to sweep it away / Keep on dreaming / Soon there'll be a reason / To see it through one more day   Merry Christmas. Hope for me, and hope with me, because like I told a friend of mine once, I forget so often and there is no time to forget.

      Okay. You blink, and the world changes.  First:  urlLink Saddam is caught , looking ages older and more tired than he did when the world last saw him. Apparently he gave himself up without contest. I wonder what he's been thinking, all these months in hiding while his tin empire was torn to shreds and his sons were killed.  Second: Philippine Foreign Minister,  urlLink Blas Ople, is dead . Natural causes, the report says. I believe this, because I have seen the guy in person and he smokes like a chimney and drinks black coffee as if it were water. This, while looking and sounding as if he were about to collapse any moment now.   Tomorrow the other shoe will drop, and that's when I'll start talking. Today my head is stuffed up with a cold and there's not much room for discourse.

      So maybe the Philippines is not the most comfortable place in the world to live, but it is one of the most amusing, particularly around Christmas. That's when the people who provide services around the year - garbage collectors, gardeners, security personnel, janitors - hand you little white envelopes with 'Merry Christmas!' written on them. The envelopes are, of course, empty. The implication there is that  you  are to fill them (with money, REAL money) and return them so that the giver of the envelope will have a truly merry Christmas.   The humor of the situation is apparent only when you understand that most of these service providers do not exactly specialize in spelling. I present to you, unedited, the Christmas greetings on one envelope:   Mirry Chrestmas  (Name of subdivision, also horribly misspelled)  Mentinance  Hardenirro  Mang Edde   Which, of course means, that this envelope is from our maintenance man - our  hardinero , or gardener.  Hardenirro?  my mother asked.  What's that, like a relative of Robert de Niro?   So, yes. MERRY Christmas, indeed.

      Back on my feet, and I hit the ground running. Today was my second day at a course on  urlLink Transforming Institutions for a Sustainable Future . It's a distance-learning course and we get our lessons via videoconferencing from Washington, so my very first day I could barely concentrate, I was so giddy about all the cool technology. My very own computer with a flat-screen monitor! A microphone at each station that would broadcast our voices over the internet! A DSL internet connection! Lessons given on CD-ROM and interactive websites! I wanted to camp out in the learning center and bask in the utter coolness of their technology.   Today I came back to earth, slightly. The thing about sustainable development seminars is that they're always slightly depressing; one or two days looking at current and forecasted scenarios are enough to make me want to crawl into bed and pull the world in after me. As one of my classmates said earlier, while we were discussing the day's topics, there's so much to do and we have so far to go, and when you look at what we have to do against what we're actually doing, it's so easy to get overwhelmed. And, as one of the facilitators from the World Bank kept reminding us, there are absolutely no guarantees.  That, and it's slightly discouraging to figure that there is a large gap between the development strategies being promoted by Washington and the realities we see here. One very frustrated participant lashed out on the first day against what he labelled "the arrogance of the World Bank people in Washington" - he was upset that they seemed to be  telling  us what to do, rather than consulting, or advising. I don't want to judge, but so far I'm a little discouraged. The first day was forgivable, since we were being presented with overviews and general scenarios, but I'd looked forward to the second day because they'd promised to give us case studies. We  did  get case studies, but they were cases conducted in Africa and South America. That's wonderful and the cases were rather striking, but still - Asia is a different matter altogether. We're still not connecting.  We're talking a lot now about building consensus, identifying catalysts for change inside communities, figuring out access points and lines of communication between disparate cultures and communities. Our group identified education, in particular, as a critical development issue - if we're going to start building the foundation for the future, we might as well develop the capabilities of the country's future leaders while we're at it.   I wonder what's going to happen after this course is over. All of us are going home with nifty little certificates; I'm going to have something good to add to my resume. What happens to the people we're helping, though? The names and faces and stories I come across and talk about and remember - how do I translate this into something that actually affects them?  I'm excited about all this new knowledge, and thrilled at the opportunity. But still - how tiny my hands are, and how huge and wounded this world is.

      It's been a rough week or so. So much to do, and the computer's breaking down regularly and I can't connect my colored printer and I can't find my old articles and every time I think about the story I want to write I get overloaded. Sleep is hard to get, nowadays. I work until past midnight, until my eyes are drooping and I can no longer keep my head up, and still when I go to bed, after I close my eyes, I cannot go to sleep. The other day I fell off relatively early, only to wake jarringly early the next morning to a horrible nightmare that still haunts me when I think of it.  I'm so tired. This afternoon I was standing in the MRT station, waiting for the train to arrive, and for no reason at all I started crying - no, that's too active a word. I was standing there waiting and tears started spilling, and I started wiping them away, horrified, and they just kept on coming. All I could think was  Please let me not break down in an MRT station where I cannot even call my mother to pick me up, please let me get to a phone first  and eventually I managed to pull myself together.  It's so hard to explain this sadness. I don't understand it, myself. Most days I'm fine. I like it best when I'm happy, when I can turn my face toward the light and feel like I'm drinking it in, when small things can make me laugh, when just walking is enough to make me glad to be alive. Other days aren't so great - there are moody days and irritable days and bad-hair days and fat days and PMS days, when I feel less like Snow White and more like one of the Seven Dwarves.  And there are the bad days, when I wake up and cannot get out of bed. Last week was full of those bad days, a week so unproductive that every time I think about it, I am ashamed. I would go to bed early every night and wake up late, and then pull the covers over my head and sleep some more. If I left my room at all, it was to grab a glass of water or to go to the bathroom; then I would go back and lock the door. All the time I felt like I was drowning.  C suggests Stresstabs, but I'm not sure that popping pills is the best solution. At this point, I am just about ready to do  anything  to stop from almost-breaking down in public again. Shuffle around like a slug, yes. Nightmares and insomnia, fine. Loss of appetite - well, I need to lose weight anyway. But cracking up in front of half of the Philippine population - no, no, no, a million times  no .

      Sometimes coming back is an enjoyable thing, despite all the bitchy things I've said about returning. Tuesday I was asked to speak at a career orientation program for juniors, in the high school I graduated from. One of my friends from that school is now one of the high school guidance counsellors, so she gave me a last-minute call to inform me that she'd put me on the program as a resource speaker for the field of political science. It was an invitation I couldn't turn down - because of my friend, and because of the fact that I have fond memories of that high school.   Tuesday morning I set off bright and early, with a two-page outline/summary of the talk I intended to give on the field of political science (which I had hastily written and printed out thirty minutes before I left home). An hour after I arrived at the school, I was semi-panicking and wondering if I could still back out, for many reasons:  (a) Two of the other resource speakers had come frighteningly prepared, with professional-looking PowerPoint presentations and about ten pages' worth of speeches. Another one was not quite so amazingly prepared, but then again she was my year's valedictorian, so I supposed she had just stored it all in her mega-brain.  (b) It turns out we were going to be speaking to the ENTIRE JUNIOR CLASS for three hours, from a panel-like set-up onstage. I peeked at the table and was a little taken aback to see that the front skirt had a tendency to get tossed up by the wind from the electric fan, thereby giving the audience intermittent peeks at our legs. I happened to be wearing a skirt (a respectable beige knee-length one, which was paired with a matching jacket, but STILL) and had chosen not to wear stockings. Imagine sitting up onstage, trying to talk to a bunch of teenagers while worrying about whether they're checking out your bare legs. Oy.  (c) Not to be insulting to my own course, but political science is just not the sexiest career option when you're fifteen or sixteen. I was up there with resource speakers for careers in business, medicine, engineering, mass communications, the arts, and music. To make things worse, the guy speaking for music turned out to be the former guitarist of one of Manila's more popular rock bands. How was I supposed to compete with that?   At any rate, I got through a trifle more than respectably. Perhaps it was my legs - I have been told I have nice ones, which I appreciate because not all parts of my body are equally nice. Perhaps it was the fact that I complimented the school organ, as it turns out that the current editor-in-chief is a junior - although to be fair, I did not know that at the time, and it was an honest compliment because I was that paper's first ever editor-in-chief and it *so* did not look like that during my time. While I was talking there were students who actually appeared to be listening - as opposed to chatting, making eyes at their crushes, or listening to CDs - and I got a few questions during the open forum. Best of all, I got a surprisingly enthusiastic round of applause as I walked across the stage to get my certificate of appreciation. My former vice-principal, who gave me the certificate, was grinning.  This girl,  she told the students as I hugged her and my former guidance counsellor,  used to do nothing but read books in class WHILE her teachers were lecturing. Her math teacher used to confiscate them and throw them out the window, and she would sneak out of class so she could get them back.    While we're recounting previous sins,  I added, also into the microphone,  You might as well tell them that I didn't attend classes either.  I suppose this endeared me to the black sheep of the class, because now I have fans. Go me.  The best part, however, was at the lunch afterward. I was chatting with the vice-principal, reliving my much-spotted past, when she told me:  Oh, but you know, your batch was the one we loved the most.  Which was touching in the extreme, since that was a difficult time for me. It was nice to know that someone remembered it - and me - with fondness.  Yesterday afternoon I went with my dad to a meeting he had with my former boss. I sat there and took notes, which is what he brought me for, and afterwards we all had a brief chat about KL and what had happened to all the people and projects we'd left behind.  You slimmed down,  my former boss observed, as we headed out for the elevator.    I'm wearing black, sir,  I pointed out.  But thank you very much.  It was almost fun to see him again, and to be able to sit back and observe all those little work-related idiosyncrasies I'd gotten used to after a year of working with him. He is not the type of person you get close to, but he was a relatively nice person to work for. Sitting there, I had flashbacks of all the good times I had at the office - mostly with my ex-colleague PH, as we argued over what wallpaper to put on our computer and what music to play when he was out of the office.   If only coming back were always like this - pleasant and undisturbing, with something new and productive built on the foundation of the past. This is what I *wanted* to do with those old friends: catch up on what's happened since, find the places that we have both moved on to, and meet there again, as equals. And then again, to quote Jeanette Winterson:  Never say that something has moved you if you are still in the same place.    Ah well. Tomorrow I will be writing about Mindanao and separations, in response to something G and I are corresponding about through e-mail. In the meantime, I have learned that not all reunions are bad things - something which I knew intellectually, but then again none of your lessons really make sense until you've lived them.

      From a letter I wrote W, back in July of 2001:   His name is Martin, but we call him “jungle man” because he is tall and dark and hairy. Since the first class, he has had a big, bushy beard that looks like Amazons could get lost in it, and he always wears brightly-colored tropical shirts, khaki pants, and well-worn sandals -- all of which, of course, makes the "jungle man" nickname seem all the more appropriate. He has a big, brusque voice which is always strangely kind, and he always looks as if he's either laughing, just stopped laughing, or will laugh in a moment. When I went for classes last last week, he had, amazingly, shaved off his beard (leaving only his mustache) making him look smaller and younger. Martin is in the Navy, and is perpetually being sent off to fight the Abu Sayyaf and various terrorists in the Southern Philippines, and he delights in telling me about my "weird countrymen". (I say:  They're not weird, Martin, they're criminals.  He says:  They're weird criminals.  I concur.) He played basketball once with Filipinos and got his ass kicked. We argue all the time in class because his worldview is the total opposite of mine, and he's one of the few classmates i actually have fun with.   Is it strange that all my class buddies are army men? should we be concerned that i have a weird affinity with people who know how to use a gun or drop bombs off planes or fire torpedoes? ...  It’s July and it’s dusty in my office and the muezzin calls in the afternoon are beginning to drive me insane. (He’s only supposed to call them to prayer; instead he ends up singing the whole freaking prayer.) I’ll come home when I’m real again because I looked in the mirror this morning and there I was, fading at the edges.   It's funny because nowadays, I can wholeheartedly concur with friends who tell me I was crazy to put up with the endless back-and-forthing of that relationship. I was barely eighteen when I fell in love with him, and halfway to my twenty-third birthday when I finally gave up. That's almost five years, an oddly apt period of time. One of the local rock bands had a song called "Five Years", which was about a relationship that had failed. It had no lyrics except for one line:  But he will never be back , the singer moaned, the rest of the song sounding like a scream of despair and frustration. It was not quite that hard for me, because of all the things I am good at, I am excellent at goodbyes. The last time I spoke to him was on the phone, and I knew when I put down the phone that I would never speak to him again in the same manner.  Then again, I look back at letters I wrote him (because I have lost almost all of his letters to me) and remember how much I loved him, how much more interesting the world became when I knew I was going to be talking to him about it. It's almost like looking back at another person. Who was this girl who loved him, who wrote letters that were more private than her journal? How I felt about him comes off the paper in waves. What happens to all that emotion after a relationship ends? How does the heart and mind deal?   I wonder, because although the door is closed now, I don't understand how it could have been so easy.  Recently I closed another door - slightly harder and with more antagonism than I did the last one.  Why are you being so mean?  he asked, looking bewilderedly at me through the dim lighting of the bar we ran into each other in. Half an hour ago he had come over to our table at the insistence of my sister, and I had blown cigarette smoke in his face and turned my back on him while he was trying to introduce me to his brother (although I did shake hands, politely, with his brother).  Why are you avoiding me?  I asked back.   (Granted, that was a rather dumb question since every time we'd run into each other recently, I'd been - shall we say - less than friendly. I would not exactly be eager to talk to someone, for example, who talked to me in a tone of impatient dismissal.)  At any rate, over is over and I am moving on - although much less inclined to be nice this time. The problem with nice, as I see it, is that people assume they can walk over you - and then they get upset when you reach the end of your rope and begin to snap back. I am more inclined now to adopt my sister's philosophy - stick first, *then* the carrot. It worked quite well the night before last, when I met up with my sister and her friends at a bar - although I cannot say it bodes well for the reputation of Filipino men that they appear to be more appreciative of bitches than nice girls.   The process, however, has been undeniably therapeutic. We bullied our way in past the bouncers and got in for free. We did not pay for a single drink, since there were plenty of people who were ready, willing, and able to buy them for us. We would scan the crowd, looking for people we wanted to dance with, then - depending on our individual inclinations - would crook our fingers or make eye contact and summon them with a head gesture. Surprisingly, everyone we summoned came. We dismissed people with equal casualness - my sister by waving her hand, myself by simply turning around and walking away.   In the end, I walked away having given my number to a rather slow specimen whose parents had given him a computer shop (perhaps to ensure their progeny would be employed, as it did not appear he would be able to sustain work in an environment that was any more competitive than nursery school). He is taking me and my friends out this Friday to another bar, and I will see where it goes from there.   In the meantime, I don't suppose I'll fall in love in Manila again. The agony is *so* not worth the ecstasy.

      Well. It's a belated greeting, but it's meant in good faith nevertheless. I meant to post about it yesterday - which is when Chinese New Year started this year - but the Internet connection was acting up, and I didn't feel like getting into another altercation with my PC. I was at a mall yesterday and they had a dragon dance, but no one really seemed to know what it was for, so everyone just kind of gawked and then walked hurriedly by. It did not help, of course, that apparently no one had thought to clear a space for the dance, so the dancers were limited to doing weird little hops from side to side.   There are times I miss KL, and this is one of them. I love dragon dances. They were a big thing in KL, with the dancers doing various acrobatics and stunts while in the suit; PH and I used to go out on our lunch breaks during the CNY season just to look for the next scheduled dragon dance, since each public area would schedule its own. Having the dragon dance performed somewhere is supposed to bring the place luck and prosperity, so if we were really into it, we could get to watch one new one per day.   Yesterday I went out as well - with an old friend from high school. We met up at Starbucks and ended up chatting for a while; then he got called back to work and I headed back home. It was rather uneventful, as outings go; I ended up talking seventy-five percent of the time, my friend stared at me as if I had grown tentacles, and I ended up feeling very uncomfortable.   Sometimes reunions drain me. The inherent assumption in meeting up, after all, is that there will be an equal exchange of news, of viewpoints - that you will approach each other as old friends who have travelled different paths, but have not forgotten your common experiences. What happens during my reunions is far from that. Often I come ready for a major chat session - eager to find out what's gone on in my friends' lives since I've been gone, and equally eager to share what's happened in mine.   What actually happens is disappointing. More often than not, my friend assumes that my life has been far more interesting and active than his or hers, and withdraws:  Oh,  they say disparagingly,  My life? Same old thing. In the same job, dating the same person, hanging out at the same old places. I'm sure you have far more to tell.  And although I  do  have plenty to say, that shuts me up more effectively than a gag. It's like walking blindfolded into a room where all the lights have been shut off. You have no idea if they can relate to what you are saying, if your words find purchase, if this person you're talking to is still the friend you used to share confidences and bitch with. Under their intent stare, you feel less like a companion and more like a performer; your stories feel less like sharing and more like public entertainment. You have been placed on a stage with a spotlight, for a show you have not rehearsed for. Even worse, you don't know what your audience expects, or what they want.   It makes me wonder, sometimes. In the Philippines, did I really have friends, or did I only have an audience? Because so often I meet up with my so-called friends, get called upon to display myself and my "exotic" life, and come home feeling wrung-out and stained, used like tissue.   It hasn't even been one month into the New Year, and already everything feels tarnished.

      Not to distract from the bitching, because in certain situations it can actually be a Very Good Thing. In this case it is, since it is all that stands in between me and a lot of psychosis-induced homicidal casualties.   However, let me just note that  urlLink the new Blade of the Immortal manga  is ridiculously overpriced in ComicQuest. I was willing to pay up to US15 (that would be about PhP 825) for it - in KL it always cost about USD14, so I figured that was a reasonable budget. But no. The newest issue is TWENTY BUCKS. That's ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED PESOS. My golly. I could buy a bottle of vodka or tequila for that much, and it would last a lot longer. Never mind - I will wait until (a) the store lowers the price to a reasonable level (something that does not overshoot the minimum daily wage by QUITE so much) or (b) I can buy it somewhere else.  By somewhere else, of course, I mean Not Here.  In the meantime, WOE. Also, ANGUISH and DESPAIR. For - according to the synopsis - Magatsu has teamed up with Manji, and Shira is chasing them, and there will be much kick-ass swordplay. [spoilers - highlight to see]  Magatsu finally confronts Shira for what he did to that poor little whore a few issues back, something I have been waiting forever for Samura to bring back into the storyline. Oh, and Anotsu gets hitched!  [/spoilers] Woe.   Damn you, you crass evil forces of commercialism and corporate profit. Damn you.

      I have many many things that I need to bitch about, not the least of which are the following:  > The upcoming elections. Who are the people I will have to choose from for my country's next president? The incumbent president, who is running for reelection (despite the fact that she promised she wouldn't) because she claims it is her duty? A former minister of the department of education, who was relieved of his position due to suspicions of corruption, and who is now making grand statements about being the only candidate without a "bad record"? An actor, who may or may not be a Filipino citizen, dropped out of high school after his second year, and has strong links to a former actor-president with questionable moral standards? A former police chief and current senator, who is strongly suspected to be in cahoots with local crime groups? A businessman who ran for senator in the last electoral race and only got 456 votes? The leader of a local evangelistic movement who claims that he is the only alternative to corrupt leadership? (Note that I am not mocking his so-called Divine Mandate because hey, when I get *my* Divine Mandate, I do not want anyone mocking me.  Capisce ?)  You know it might just be me, but I'm not really seeing a winning proposition in the bunch.  >  urlLink Philippine election proceedings . Not only are our candidates a bunch of laughs (we had one nuisance candidate who claimed that Bush was her husband - Laura honey, wake up, your man's got some explaining to do), but the proceedings themselves are a joke. Apparently the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) spent about USD 15 million of the taxpayers' money on equipment that cannot even be used because - among other reasons - they weren't purchased according to proper auditing standards and regulations.   This makes me almost glad that I am jobless and not contributing to taxes. Hello, if you're going to fritter away money it better not be MY money, you bastards. Goddamn use your own.  > The public transportation system in the Philippines. A friend of mine from India once told me that in Mumbai, their railway cabs are only meant to hold about 50 people apiece. However, due to overpopulation and the fact that 80% of the population lives on one side of the line and works on the other side, what actually happens is that the cabs are regularly filled to about four times their capacity. Hence, he said, when there is a railway accident, the death toll averages about 700-1000.   The situation here is not quite that bad, but IT IS CLOSE. I say it is not that bad because none of our railway cabs have derailed. Yet.  > Having twenty million relatives living on and off in your house (but mostly on). This has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I love them, but GODDAMN. When 75% of the trash isn't even yours, when you cannot put something into the laundry without worrying about whether it might be sorted into someone else's cabinet because damn how can you tell the difference anymore, when you don't have anything to eat because the stuff that's being cooked has to cater to the general majority and it's something you cannot stand to eat - all of this IN YOUR OWN HOUSE - then it becomes a major problem.  It becomes even more of a problem when they look like they're settling in for the long haul, and *you* are struggling to find a job to support yourself because you're worried about being a mooch. I'm just saying.  > Taking care of my nephew, who has ADD, because his mother is so consumed with her job that she has no time for him. This is understandable until I come to the point where she leaves just after he leaves for school and comes home after he's gone to bed and the major onus of childrearing - the tutoring, watching-over, following-up, cuddling, disciplining - falls on whoever is at home, most often me. Not to sound completely heartless, but HE IS NOT MY CHILD. I cannot comprehend why I am the one sacrificing my plans so someone can be home with this kid, and why I am the one who has to buy the kid slippers when his old ones break or help him clean his shoes or nag him about his assignments being done.  I am not a single mommy I do not want to be a mommy I have taken every single precaution I know of just so that I will not have to be one and you can be sure that I will definitely be getting that hysterectomy sometime in the future. So WHY am I wiping this kid's snot and making sure he goes to bed on time when he's not even mine? WHY?  > The move to the US. Are we or aren't we? Only God knows. I am not, by the way, taking His name in vain because at this point, honestly only He knows. If anyone has a clue or can get one by any method available, please drop me a line so I know whether to rip open all our remaining boxes and find my beloved leather jackets, or to restrain myself and leave them alone so that I won't have to repack them. Please. I am going through leather-jacket-withdrawal, and it's not pretty.  >  Leche flan . Do not even get me started on how difficult it is to find a  local  dessert in its home city. It's caramelized sugar poured over a mixture of egg yolk and condensed milk, for pity's sake. What is so difficult about making it, and why can I not find a place that serves  leche flan  that does not taste like sweet eggy cardboard?  > My love life, which sucks big-time ass. The only reason I haven't been writing about it is because it's so sad I can barely believe it's mine. The cognitive dissonance involved in knowing that you are an intelligent, rational human being who nevertheless manages to get tangled up in relationships where you are ignored for months on end because the person in question is "too lazy" or "too busy" or too whatever to try to contact you is mind-boggling. What, do I have a gigantic tattoo on my head that says "It's okay if you just walk away, I have metal ovaries! I won't be too torn about it, so neither should you!"   I can't even laugh about this, it hurts too much.  ---  At this point I am capable of writing entire sagas about each and every one of these things. Unfortunately, my energy limits me to doing only one, so I will have to deliberate.  In the meantime, yes, I'm drowning.

      I was originally not planning to do this, but something about the  urlLink Mayfly Project  is inherently appealing. Looking back at the year that just went by, counting the costs and the benefits, remembering the moments that dance in red, and the moments that writhe in the shadows behind your consciousness - and realizing that at the end of it all, you're still standing. I get such a kick out of doing that - it's like looking all my failure in the face and still having the strength to laugh with real humor.   The year before last was all about forgiveness - about walking back, opening all my firmly locked doors, and letting go of what I'd hidden there. The funny thing about the mind is that it hides the things you don't want to keep, the way normal people hide away their valuables. Childhood monsters, bogeymen, memories of all the mistakes you made and the people who suffered for them. My monsters didn't really disappear the moment I let them out, nor were they any less scary or painful, and there are still lots of locked doors. The thing is, I'm in control now. The keys are back in my hand.   As for last year - last year was about moving on.    Looking for home in three countries A heart that folds neatly into a suitcase And friends that do not.   And there, my friends, you have my 2003 experience in a nutshell.

      I shouldn't be here - I should be industriously at work on my very last MBA paper, which I plan to submit this afternoon at around 3PM (via e-mail, so I'm not really that rushed). My initial enthusiasm for this paper, which was based on the fascinating story that is  urlLink Google , has waned since I've had to rewrite this paper TWO TIMES already. On the other hand, I honestly cannot see myself throwing away two years of studying all because of one stupid paper, so very soon I will return to my drudgery.   In the meantime, I have discovered that the Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur really doesn't update their website very often, so you'd be better off not really relying on the information you get from it. Hard evidence can be found  urlLink here , where they list the names of people who no longer work there, and have not been working there for at least two months.

      Two holiday weeks in Bacolod, a little jewel of a city nestled away in the Visayan islands that is filled with the unique, the quirky, the abominably delicious. My parents and I (my sister was working and couldn't come with us) left it ten pounds heavier and stress-free. The things I saw, and have stories about, and am bursting to tell of:  > A family graveyard, built in the MIDDLE of one of the city's major roads;  > A street lined with small mini-restaurants (and I use that term extremely loosely to describe a group of wood-and-concrete stalls differentiated only by the quality of their chicken and the posters that line their walls) that all serve the same thing, chicken inasal (barbequed chicken) and rice. Aside from a small selection of drinks, all of the establishments on that street serve nothing else. As Poe says (no not THAT Poe, Filipinos, the other one): "Only this, and nothing more."  > Playing badminton with my aunts, discovering that I am execrable at it, and that to make up for my lack of skill in sports, I am extremely talented in picking up the nuances and structure of sports rules and scoring. Go me. Although I *did* fare rather better when we weren't playing with the Tasmanian Devils of Badminton anymore - their serves must have been whizzing across the net at, I don't know, a few tens of miles per hour?  > Two restaurants - Bob's and Pendy's, that are local cuisinary legends and have expanded on the basis of their respective specialties. Bob's is a rather all-around bakery, although it prides itself most on its chocolate cookies/cakes and its nummy Fruit Punch, which is the first juice I have ever had to chew (because it had chunks of actual fruit in it). Pendy's grew famous on the strength of its Half-Moon Cake alone, which should tell you how evil and rich that cake is.   > An eight-year-old girl who can, upon the slightest urging, recite reams of poetry and Bible verses, recall the geopolitical history of Singapore, and accelerated through three grades of piano lessons in less than a year.   > The dogs at my great-uncle's house, of which there were legion. There were three puppies that were initially shy and grew increasingly more shameless as my mother and I began feeding them; there was their mother, who intensely disliked breastfeeding her offspring; there was a neurotic brown dog, who seemed to have ADD since he could NOT eat while standing still; and there was a shedding and itchy dog named Blanc and renamed Scraggly by one of my aunts, because by golly he is. We teased my other aunt, who is a dermatologist, about how ironic it is that she has a dog with a skin disease.  > Hearing my mom being interviewed on a local radio station, and getting dragged in for a very short follow-up interview myself. For the record, they wanted us to tell them how we had become such a solid, model-family unit, and I had to work very hard not to say things like  By working very hard at loving each other through our ugliest times, and by not airing our dirty laundry in public.   > Visiting a local holiday spot, the Christmas Village - which is actually a personal collection and arrangement of a HUGE array of Christmas-themed clay miniatures. The Village was gradually built up over a period of eight years, and is set up inside the home of the artist himself. The artist, unsurprisingly, is a fiftyish man who is still single.  There is much, much more - bonfire night on New Year's Eve, speaking to the local church's youth group on commitment (which was ironic in many ways, one of which is the fact that I've never been in an actual relationship), and trying desperately to stay up for the traditional Noche Buena dinner only to give up and go to bed instead, and find later that everyone else had had the same idea. My problem, as I often find when I return to blogging after an extended absence, is not that there are no words but rather that there are too many.   On the edge of New Year's Eve, I stood out in my great-uncle's driveway with my mother and one of my aunts, holding sparklers while everybody else watched sedately from the covered garage. As fireworks pulsed overhead and I watched star-shaped sparks falling from the wand in my hand, I wondered why we choose light and flame and noise to signal the advent of a new year. Why fire, a potentially destructive force? Why not eggs and flowers and clay earthenware filled with soil, symbols of fertility and new life?  It's occurred to me since then that maybe that's how we want to see the New Year: that with the passing of a year, we can burn away all we were, all we used to be, and become completely new. Not for us the gestation and gradual emergence of conception and birth: we don't want change to take time, to have to remember that our resolutions will have to be imposed on a life that runs on crooked wheels, in grooves that are pebble-filled. We want to immolate ourselves and come out completely different, changed beings. Like I told the youth group in that small church, we like to think that when we change circumstances, we can change who we are - that we can become something completely different from who we are now.   Or maybe I'm generalizing, and that's how  I  want to see the New Year. So many mistakes, and so many false steps, and too many times when I turned my back on the right thing to do what was easier to do at the time. Given such an overwhelmingly bad record, sometimes you feel as if it's easier to set fire to the whole damn thing and just reinvent yourself -   Although that's not always a bad thing. In a weird, hidden-between-the-lines sort of way, it sometimes means that you still hope for something better, that you still dream. Maybe you want to take shortcuts to get there, and maybe your hopes aren't always realistic, but hey. To borrow from a song,  don't dream it's over .  On that note, a belated Happy New Year's.

      First: the return of the quiz! You know you secretly love them, even though they are the Internet equivalent of Britney Spears' songs. Here's one that isn't from Quizilla, for once:          You're    the United Nations!      Most people think you're ineffective, but you are trying to completely save the world from itself, so there's always going to be a long    way to go. &nbsp;You're always the one trying to get friends to talk to each    other, enemies to talk to each other, anyone who can to just talk instead of  beating each other about the head and torso. &nbsp;Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and you get very schizophrenic as a result. &nbsp;But your heart is in the right place, and sometimes also in New York.   Take the  urlLink Country  Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid       My heart is in New York! Whee! So true. Also -        You're  Catch-22 !   by Joseph Heller     Incredibly witty and funny, you have a taste for irony in all that you see. It seems that life has put you in perpetually untenable situations, and your sense of humor is all that gets you through them. These experiences have also made you an ardent pacifist, though you present your message with tongue sewn into cheek. You could coin a phrase that replaces the word &quot;paradox&quot; for millions of people.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .     Strangely, I have never read  Catch-22 , although it was floating around my cousin's house a few years back when I was there on vacation. I will read it now because the quiz said nice things about my sense of humor, which only tells you how vapid I can be.  Speaking of vapid, I am currently deep in the throes of obsession with, of all things, a couple of reality shows:  urlLink American Idol 3 , and - oh, this is embarrassing -  urlLink For Love or Money . American Idol I understand, because hey, good music, kick-ass voices, and a judge who says what we are all thinking - what's not to love? Plus, I have a soft spot for Camile Velasco. I liked Bao Viet too, but apparently he didn't make it to the top 12. Damn.   As for the latter show, I cannot explain it. Perhaps it is the fact that all the girls - well, the ones that are left, anyway - are insanely nice to one another. I have visions of the show's producers scratching their heads and trying all sorts of behind-the-scenes gimmicks just to get a little catfight started, because we all know that's what gets the ratings. And yet the girls continue to be incredibly sweet, with their late night chats and their helping each other to get ready for dates - with the same guy.   Still, these are shows that manage to drag me out of lethargy and get me so excited I literally hop on the way to the television - not an appealing mental image, but a true one nonetheless. Again, I say - Camile Velasco, you cutie. Apparently you just had a bad week but managed to squeak through to the finals. I agree with Randy - bring back the hiphop, girl. You can do so much more with that voice than - what the hell -  One Last Cry . Only drunk men who cannot even get paid sex should sing that song. If you are like me and love this show beyond reason, check out  urlLink this place  because they have pretty funny recaps of what went on.  American Idol , the show that frees your inner bitch. Me-ow. Compared to Simon, however, I am the tweetest puddytat in the world. Yes, even on my bad days.  In a completely unrelated development, I just got hired and they are now drawing up the contract. I am no longer a complete drain on my country's resources! Whee!

      I attended a political rally yesterday - the first one I've ever attended, and not the last one, I hope. Like I told Yaz and Lin in chat earlier, I hope to get a chance to attend at least one political rally per candidate. That way I get to hear everybody's blustering rhetoric, see things from all sides, and make an informed decision in the end. Plus, I get to observe Philippine political behavior upfront - whee! I hope I will be allowed to, because for some reason my parents are afraid that in the course of doing so, I will get myself trampled upon or spraypainted or arrested or hit in the head with a rock. I, on the other hand, labor happily under the delusion that I am too smrt - er,  smart  - to get caught up in any of these idiocies. Well, we shall see.  Since I have no wish to be cryptic, I will reveal whose political rally I attended - Brother Eddie Villanueva, the evangelical church leader who claims his mandate came from God. From a cynic's point of view, not a very good line - the same claim has been made by both Arroyo and Roco - but then again apparently God is a just God and does not play favorites. Everybody is His candidate, with a few exceptions. I note that Lacson, the believer in savage justice, has not claimed any relationship with the Divine - perhaps he is afraid he will be struck by lightning. Neither has Poe, but then again Poe and his supporters are convinced that they need no one, not even a Deity, to be popular. As for Eddie Gil, I suspect that when he asked God to endorse him, God could not answer through his gusts of roaring laughter. So be it.  Pro points: The rally started ON TIME. We were told that it would start at 6PM; my parents (active supporters of the Bro. Eddie ticket - yes, he really *is* called Brother Eddie) insisted that we leave the house by 4PM. (This is one of my sister's and my pet peeves: that our parents always, ALWAYS leave for their appointments ridiculously early, in a region that does not take punctuality seriously. It is very annoying to arrive at a venue at least thirty minutes before the appointed time, only to find that the event will start at least two hours late.) At the last minute I decided not to bring a book, because after all, it would be my first time at a political rally and there would be better things to see. As it turns out, at exactly 6PM - by my watch! - the emcee picked up the mike and the program began. It was exactly three hours. Again, at precisely 9PM, the whole thing ended.   Other pro points, which count for less because punctuality in the Philippines makes me giddy: No sexbomb entertainment, which means no scantily-clad girls shouting inane political catchphrases while waggling their booties at us. (Yes, even if there are children in the audience. Which is why the Janet scandal did not touch the Philippines in the least.) The entertainment was QUALITY entertainment - Kuh Ledesma was one of the emcees - and all of them were there of their own volition (read: they were not paid). There were no stupid political songs, although we had to suffer through a few renditions of the Bro. Eddie theme song. The ten-point program looked sound, and the basic platforms of government being offered were well-thought-out and logical.  Con points: Well, the campaign colors are particularly violent shades of yellow and green - yes, that's a bad thing, visually speaking, since the shade of yellow they picked does *not* suit Filipino skintones at all. Which is to say that even if I do end up supporting Brother Eddie, I will not be wearing his t-shirt. (I will be wearing Lacson's, because his color is red.) The premise of the campaign - and indeed, of Villanueva's reason for running - still seems incredibly naive to me. Apparently he ran because he saw no viable alternative for the country, and therefore offered himself up. I do not doubt his sincerity - I do not doubt he  wants  to do a better job. However, translating that sincerity and passion into actual policies - will his motives prevail, or will he be unwittingly led astray by the power grabbers, seekers, and manipulators that will inevitably litter his path? He is also surrounded by good-hearted but equally naive people like my father. Watching them campaign and plan and strategize is like watching a kitten toddle into a den full of hungry lions.   I fear for them.  The official campaign period is in full swing - and when I say that, I am picturing monkeys and all manner of wild animals dangling from the chandeliers, bouncing off the walls, cartwheeling across the linoleum. In short, I am visualizing pure chaos, a literal mad carnival. I've already recounted Villanueva's campaign, now as for the rest:   > Arroyo and her incredibly arrogant running mate Noli de Castro (a popular newscaster who thinks he is God's gift to the political landscape) kicked off their campaigns in the highlands, due to a superstitious belief that they will be able to conquer all the areas they can gaze down upon. Arroyo made cracks about her diminutive size, somehow relating her dwarfishness to the oppressed lives of the poor; de Castro smiled and made much of his provincial beginnings. Apparently, he came out to the big bad city as a naive farmboy with holes in his clothes and nothing but flipflops on his feet. Naturally, he did not mention the big expensive bash he threw recently for his adopted daughter's wedding, at a pricey garden venue inside Quezon City.   > Roco, in traditional floral shirt, went to Cardinal Sin's house for a mass, accompanied by his running mates, his wife, and his mommy. He avoided the current Manila archbishop's house - not because said archbishop has openly refused to endorse any candidates, he said, but because he didn't want the visit to be construed as "political". Instead he goes to the more politically-inclined priest to hear mass, and from there proceeded to Bicol, the province in which he has the strongest support. He toured elementary schools, signed autographs for teachers (who will be the vote-counters this May), and had the traditional "simple meal" (rice with fish, eaten with bare hands - considered a poor person's meal, here in the Philippines) complete with media coverage. Before you ask, that still does not make him a traditional politician because he too was one of those poor little farmboys who got sent to the big bad city to make good.   One day I will make a sign that says "A traditional politician is what YOU are, not who your parents were." Your father may have been illiterate and your mother a struggling schoolteacher, but they are not the people we are voting into position.  > Lacson, in a red shirt, travelled down the Diosdado Macapagal highway with a motorcade adorned with red-and-white balloons. He labelled the highway "the most expensive highway in the universe", which immediately made me wonder if he had actually managed to obtain stats on highways that were built in Outer Reticula. We should probably hire a Klingon to examine our construction budgets next time ... but I digress. He claimed he was doing something called "nontraditional campaigning", which must have been the reason why there were absolutely no people flooding the streets to meet him. The media followed him down a street as he walked and randomly shook hands with people, all of whom looked more excited about being on television than meeting Lacson. Some looked slightly bewildered, but I will not dwell on that. I am sure the Filipino voting population is aware enough to recognize Lacson by face.   > Eddie Gil! Give me a moment while I try to stop laughing so hard ... okay. I cannot say anything about his campaign because I was too blinded by tears of laughter to watch. For one thing, his hair. He claims that he is worth USD40 billion - therefore he should be able to afford a better wig than the one he is wearing, or at least a very good hair weave! On the other hand, perhaps he idolizes Elvis Presley, in which case I have no room to mock because in the past I too imitated the hairstyles of my favorite stars (fortunately, Lea Salonga is not given to outlandish coiffures). For another thing, if he is worth that much he should at least be able to pay his campaign bills - but no. He was reduced to trying to sneak out of a hotel yesterday to avoid having to pay his bills, but the kitchen staff detained him - such an ignoble fate for a presidential candidate. This is the man, note, who promised that he would pay off the national debt with his personal funds.   He has supporters, but do not be surprised because their sanity, too, is questionable.  > Poe, as expected, had a made-for-TV program as his campaign offering. This meant scantily clad girls (although the President's rally had some sexy antics on stage as well - although not by the President herself, thank heaven), comedians trying to be satirical by poking fun at the citizenship issue filed against Poe, various showbiz personalities testifying that he is a good person and has a sincere desire to help the country (see my comments on sincerity above), and his elegant wife eloquently pleading for the masses to give her husband a chance to work his mojo on the much-begrimed state of the nation. Poe then gave a 12-minute speech, during which he did much lambasting of the current situation, but did not give much insight into how exactly he planned to change it. There were a few vague catchwords thrown about, such as 'renewal of the tax system to improve revenue collection', if I remember correctly, but as I said, nothing specific. Rumor has it that to all media questions regarding his political/economic platforms, Poe answered "No comment".   I strongly suspect that Poe sees himself as the Enigmatic President - the one who remains mysteriously silent in the background and occasionally emerges to pronounce the Final Edict, which will naturally silence all squabblers and dissenters because Poe is Always Right. This is a role he specializes in playing, both in reel and real life - well, in the showbiz realm, at least. How do you explain to a high school dropout that you cannot dichotomize so easily in the political arena?   How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?  - - -  To Loren Legarda: when General Victor Corpus labelled you a "political prostitute", he was referring to your penchant to switch political parties and affiliations at the drop of a hat. Remember, you wept with bitter disappointment at Estrada's impeachment trial because you felt that he was being shielded from the full weight of judicial consequences, and that justice was not being properly apportioned. You won the nation with your tears, then. Yet now you are running as the vice presidential candidate of a man who is Estrada's best friend, and having cozy little lunches with pro-Estrada groups in an effort to win them over. You are no better than the candidates who do the lambada, sing, take part in gameshows, and have photo ops taken with previously bitter rivals, all in the name of political one-up-manship. You have sold your ideals and your principles for popularity. What is that but prostitution?  In other words - Corpus was referring to your political leanings, not your morality and chastity, you stupid, silly, overwrought woman. Grr argh, if you were going to get indignant about name-calling, you might as well have gotten the spirit of the insult right.  - - -  I fear for my country. And, er, no, I haven't gotten around to writing the Mindanao post yet.  Gomen !

      I am normally execrably bad at reading people and determining motives, reasons, underhanded plots and connivances, et cetera, so you can imagine how disproportionately thrilled I am that I got sixteen out of twenty on  urlLink this particular quiz . If you have time, please take it and tell me what you got, and how you were trying to distinguish genuine from fake. Me, I look at the mouth ... but I'm a fruitcake, so you wouldn't want to imitate me.   On the other hand, I'm a fruitcake who got a good score, so.  By the way, this is from the BBC, so I have a tendency to trust them. I  like  the BBC.

      I know I said I would post about Mindanao ... er, a week ago? However, I am bogged down in research. What I e-mailed G is a mishmash of information and current events and speculation and piecing-together and random readings, and I would like this to be slightly more coherent. That, and I haven't written anything even remotely resembling political analysis in a long long time. Rants and my occasional spates of bitching do not count.  In the meantime, several things that make me squee:  First:  urlLink Mia  has come back, which means that there will be good things to read on Ephemere again. College is supposed to be an arena for education and learning, but the world is so big and life so full that sometimes the lessons you have to learn are those that do not have a syllabus or an assigned text.   Second: Three words for you - Janet. Justin. Scandal. No matter what you may have thought about it, I think  urlLink this guy  makes a perfectly logical point. If this was a cheap publicity stunt, then they succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. On the other hand, if it really were an accident, then we're not really helping the so-called innocent kiddies by producing news items about the incident every 3.5 seconds. Besides, children nowadays are frighteningly advanced for their age. Earlier I was tutoring my nephew (who is in first grade) in math, and found to my astonishment that they are already covering the tessellation of shapes.  Although having said that, I will lay the smackdown on anybody who tries to cyber-flash me with their breasts. I am very pleased with my pair and I am proud that I am a woman, but there is no need to belabor the point by becoming one with Ms. Jackson. Keep your clothes on, people. Thank you.  Third: American Idol, which is my new guilty pleasure. I realize that everyone hates Simon because he is such a heartless bastard, but I also believe that everyone secretly likes him because he says all those things that we wish we could have the guts to say- things like  I'm sorry, that was bloody awful  and  That's incredibly corny . Yesterday I was watching the first round of auditions, and - well, you'd have to watch those to understand why Simon is such a bitch. (Hint: you would bitch too if you were holding auditions for a SINGING COMPETITION and eighty percent of the people auditioning could not even carry a tune.)   At any rate, he has his moments. There were two, in particular, that made me squee - one of this wacky girl who rode in on a scooter and confessed it was a gimmick to make herself stand out.  You have the potential to be the next American Idol,  Simon told her.  Lose the scooter. You don't need a gimmick.  The girl, by the way, had an amazing voice. She truly did  not  need a gimmick. The other one was during the audition of this guy with a smile that could have lit up California -  If we were giving out prizes for Best Smile, you would have won,  Simon commented.  You have the happiest face I've ever seen. You're in.   One of these days I'll start writing about what I've been up to this past week, but first - the serious stuff.

      The thing about official memoranda and letters is that they take me so long to write. The dissonance between what I actually want to say and how I have to say it is, to put it mildly, quite great. If you are familiar with  urlLink the memo I wrote about a particularly annoying trade event , then you know what I mean. If you don't, here's an example:   What I Wanted To Say    Memorandum   For		:	Post  Subject		:	Report on Status of Project X  Date		:	2 April 2004   Why have you not sent us the updates after we pleaded with you ten million times on bended knee?  Send us those updates or we will sic the Secretary on you and he will write you Memos of DOOM.  For information / appropriate action.    What I Actually Said    Memorandum   For		:	Post  Subject		:	Report on Status of Project X  Date		:	2 April 2004   We wish to follow up on our previous memorandum on the status of Project X, dated --March 2004.   Please note that this report is submitted regularly to the Secretary as part of the monthly accomplishment report. It is an important basis for performance appraisal, particularly for non-policy posts.  For information / appropriate action.   It's something about working for the government, I tell you.

      Maybe I'm being overdramatic and quixotic, but here's my take on it:    urlLink I will not vote for a turncoat.  I will not be counted among those who condone political prostitution.  I believe in keeping my word, and I will not vote for those who do not keep theirs.   And if you were interested, both Arroyo  and  Lacson swore, prior to the 2004 elections, that they would not run for president. Lacson, who was chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP) at the time he gave this interview, said vehemently:  I will not run for any political post after I step down as chief of the PNP. Politics is too dirty.   If anyone feels the same way, let me know.

      Things that are currently driving me nuts:  1.  E-mail addresses : Embracing the age of electronic mail is one thing, proposing to it with a big brass band in the background (apparently I'm  urlLink alliterative  when I'm pissed, hmm?) is entirely another. I did an inventory the other day, which is when I realized that I have SEVEN. That topples me right over Geek Cliff and straight into Paranoid Freak Canyon. WHY do I have seven addresses when I originally started out with only two?  Okay, let's see ... we have the e-mail address I use to correspond with close friends, which is also regrettably the e-mail address I have given to a couple of exes. There's the e-mail address I use to correspond to people I meet online. There's the one I use to apply to jobs with, and e-mail the people I meet at seminars and work-related stuff ... there's another one for joining mailing lists, another one for corresponding to my school in KL, another one I signed up for just because I needed an ID for Yahoo Messenger, and another one that exists, apparently, just because.   The really scary thing about all of this is that yesterday I was trying to figure out which one to delete, and could not decide. This is because they all perform a very specific function for me, and maybe also because I have schizophrenic tendencies.  2.  Inflation and Low Wages : Which is to say, everything is too expensive for me. Granted I could probably save a lot of money if I stopped indulging myself at Starbucks and Tea Republic and Delifrance's Brie on french bread, but then if I did that, life wouldn't be worth living. I did not get off my lazy butt to work just so that I could buy myself greasy, fatty food that is cheap but will ultimately clog my arteries and give me gas.   Also, if anybody knows a way to come up with money really fast, let me know, because my parents are having their silver wedding anniversary in a couple of weeks and we're trying to get them a room at the EDSA Shangri-La. We could probably get a room cheaper at the Holiday Inn or something, but PEOPLE. This is not one of those dumb anniversaries like paper or wood or pebble that you don't even remember. This is their SILVER anniversary, and we're trying to pull off something really big, with musicians and all. C and I are meeting up with someone from Shangri-La's reservation department on Thursday, so I'd better figure out how to pull a rabbit out of the hat before then.  3.  Starbucks' Mango Tea Frappés : Okay, before I comment on the frappés themselves, let me just point out - they are FRAPPÉS. They are NOT frappuccinos. Frappucinos are frappéd cappuccinos, which means they have coffee and milk in there somewhere. The tea frappés do  not  have coffee, and thankfully they also do not have milk. They are merely fruit frappés with an infusion of tea. In short, Starbucks people, stop insisting that they are frappuccinos and giving me that irritating superior look every time you do because they ARE NOT, and if you do it ONE MORE TIME I really will tell you that my name is Wixfiniqhal* (with a silent "L") and not spell it for you. So there.  Oh yes, and your mango thingies suck because they are not made of real mango. Mango concentrate, in the Philippines during mango season? Bitches,  please .  4.  Come-on Lines / Moves : Not that I am the hottest hottie to ever strut down Hot Street, but yes, I do get my fair share of come-ons, since there are people in the Philippines that will hit on anything - even a dog - in a skirt. If you are indeed planning to hit on me, or on any of my friends - or, in fact, on anyone with an IQ above 50, then here are some tips:      Inappropriate touching is a turn-off.  I may be in the extreme minority, but I do not appreciate being touched by strangers unless they have my permission to do so. Guys, this is dangerous for you because people nowadays take accusations of rape and/or harrassment a lot more seriously. Therefore, in order to be sure: ASK before you touch. ANYWHERE. (Also: don't even think about asking to touch her in private places unless you are already lovers. You'd think this would be obvious, but sadly it is not.) The other night I was pissed because the guy kept on patting my head, which is  verboten  in Thailand - where I grew up. It is an increasingly globalized world, my friends, and the girl you are chatting up may be used to a different culture from yours. In short: do not assume. ASK.    Do not stare at the girl.  It does not make her feel sexy or beautiful. As a matter of fact, it makes her feel like she has mold growing on her face or a third eyeball dangling out of her ear.    Do not overdo your polite / gallant gestures.  Pulling a chair out for her is fine. Opening the door for her is appreciated. Doing stupid-ass things like yanking a cigarette and lighter out of her hands  while she is lighting the cigarette , only to put the cigarette back into her mouth and then lighting it yourself, is just reclassifying yourself as two baby steps above 'brain donor'.    And finally,  GET RID OF YOUR POSSE , especially if half of them are representatives of the ugly side of your family. Having ten million people with you at all times does not make you look cool, it makes you look insecure. Perhaps this is not true of all Filipino females, who are notoriously mothering and enabling, but THIS particular Filipino female, along with a rapidly growing number of enlightened others, does not want a guy she will have to mother. If you absolutely  need  to have at least ten people with you at all times to affirm that you are a valid member of the human race, then YES, you fall into that category.   5.  Because of You : For the fortunate few who have never heard this song, it is an incredibly cheesy ballad sung by Keith Martin. To be perfectly fair, I must admit that it is not half as cheesy as some of the songs that have made it on the radio (*cough*Honey, My Love So Sweet*cough*), but still. The cheese factor increases exponentially by a power of ten every time the song is remade / reinterpreted by YET ANOTHER LOCAL ARTIST. Which leads me to my last gripe -   6.  The local music industry : If local performers want to know why they are not making it big internationally, despite the fact that Filipinos are known all over the world for their performing skills, here's the reason: they're not original. You could take that comment a million ways, and it would be accurate no matter how you interpreted it. However, to be more specific, when I say they're not original, this is what I mean:      They don't have original styles.  For example, Nina has a good voice, but her current style is too reminiscent of Mariah Carey, pre-breakdown. Sarah Geronimo is an amazing performer considering that she's only 16, but honey, just because you sing Celine Dion songs doesn't mean you have to sing EXACTLY like Celine.    They don't have original songs.  This is an ailment of the local acoustic genre in particular. FYI, any dumbbell with a good voice and a way with a guitar can sing "Because of You" and get applause at our local bars. That's why there are ten million of you, acoustic singers - Paolo Santos and Nyoy Volante and Nina and Kyla and lord knows who else. That's why there will be ten million more in the next five years, and that is why you will probably end up doing endless rounds of has-been bars like Hard Rock or Tia Maria's, singing to drunk expats and their ho's.   They all look the same.  Granted, we are in Asia, where everybody has dark hair and dark eyes, making it difficult to stand out on the basis of looks - aside from which, you might snark at me, you want to stand out on the basis of "talent". Fine. However, take note of the following: on the basis of voice quality alone, you don't really deserve to be stars - glory notes and unbelievably long sustained notes notwithstanding (I'm talking to YOU, Nyoy Volante - and change your name while you're at it). Heck, I saw a ten-year-old girl sing five times better than you at one of those thirty-peso karaoke machines set in the middle of a crowded arcade in a cheap mall. What I am trying to say is this: be different. Stand out. You all have the same clothing style, shoes, makeup styles, hairstyles - I bet if I looked really closely, I'd find out that you have your highlights in exactly the same places. Ditch your stylists and find your own style, and if that means wearing organic stuff and camping out at Mt. Banahaw like Cynthia Alexander, then go right ahead.   Maybe I should rename this journal the Bitch Blog, because that's all I've been doing in it lately. Or perhaps I should post a Things to Do list, just to balance things out.  * Wixfiniqhal, pronounced Wish-PHEE-ni-gah. A name invented by my sister C, in a fit of frustration with Starbucks employees who keep on asking for her name at the counter but cannot spell it, despite the fact that she has shortened it to her two-letter nickname, CJ.  How to use it  : When they ask you what your name is, say "WishPHEEnigah" really fast, then add "Make sure it's spelled correctly, okay? That's Wixfiniqhal with an X and a Q, and mind the silent 'L' at the end."

      Apparently I'm a  urlLink flexitarian . Good to know. Granted, I became one out of self-defense - particularly here in Asia where people eat the strangest things. The first few words I learn in any language are simple but very necessary - the local vernacular for "I live in (insert address)", "I cannot speak/understand (the name of the language)", "I do not eat pork", and "Is that chicken/beef/fish/vegetable?" I also learn the word for the part of the animal around the rib/breast area, as that is generally the only part of an animal that I *can* eat. So far, it's working and I have not had to eat anything strange - well, unless you count my own aunt tricking me into eating goat. It was particularly traumatic because I had a pet goat when I was very little - and what a pet! I carried it around with me all day and took it to bed with me when I was napping.   (By the way, that goat grew up believing it was a cat. It died after I left - of a broken heart, apparently, because no one else was willing to indulge it in its case of mistaken identity.)  I was not always so particular about my food. I can actually remember eating  balut  and fish eyeballs when I was a very little girl - and then again, I did a lot of things as a little girl that I am not capable of doing now. Things like befriending goats, doing a split, eating half my weight in food without gaining a pound, dropping out of class ... oh wait, strike out that last one, I still do that.  It occurred to me today that for someone with no home, I have entirely too much history. For example - I am currently working in an area where it is likely that I could run into someone I would rather not run into. Granted I haven't actually seen him yet, but I keep on bumping into reminders that he exists, and I keep on expecting to run into him one day, when I least expect it and therefore am unprepared. In another example, K, a friend of mine who works in the building right across from mine, told me that last week she went out on a group date with this guy I used to go out with. Apparently, when confronted with the fact that they knew each other (he met up with us once while we were on a girls' night out), the guy claimed he'd been blind drunk the last time we'd met up.  Apparently,  I commented,  'Blind drunk' is what they're calling 'dumb as a stump' nowadays.  This was, of course, because the last time I'd gone out with that guy, he'd said something really idiotic - so idiotic that I could not help myself and called him on it.  And then! To top it all off, K and I met up for a short break today at the Tea Republic (they have the most amazing mango teas and Toblerone cake! whee!). We were in the middle of our usual bitch session ("Wah, work sucks." "Bitch, please. I have it ten times worse than you.") when she looked up and hissed  Dammit, one of my workmates is here! Now I have to be nice again.  She was trying to find a place to hide when her workmate looked directly our way. Naturally, she then had to acknowledge him and invite him over. He came out a few minutes after placing his order at the counter, followed by another workmate ..   ... who turned out to be another one of those people I'd rather avoid, due to a rather unpleasant episode of my life in which he played a starring role. Nevertheless, they came over and sat down, K and I gave each other desperately fake grins, and we spent the rest of the lunch hour reminiscing about our insane former high school. It is true that blessings sometimes come cleverly disguised - how was I supposed to know that my two-year stint in a school where I interacted regularly with druggies, rich brats, war freaks, space cadets, and people with various learning disorders was going to be my saving grace in millions of awkward situations to come? (If you were wondering, I was one of the people with learning disorders - I could not learn *anything* about Filipino history to save my life. Yaz was a space cadet, and Laya and K were war freaks, hee hee.)   At any rate, we got out of it without causing scandal and mayhem in the midst of Makati - something I am so proud of that I rewarded myself with a chocolate-chip oatmeal cookie. Mmm, good.  [ EDIT : Okay, I officially have WAY too much history going on. On the train home from work, less than an hour after I posted this, I glanced casually to my right - and froze. Standing not five feet away from me was this guy I'd had a crush on in high school. We didn't have history, not in the conventional meaning of the word: that is, I had a huge crush on him and I thought he liked me back. To be fair, he did. Well - until I finished his computer paper for him, at which point he dropped me like a hot potato. Story of my life. And no, he didn't recognize me at all.]  Right now I feel as if I'm in the eye of a storm - a  fierce calm , as Tori Amos puts it. Everything seems to be frenetically in motion: when I go to bed, I am usually so tired that I slide into sleep - past dozing, past dream-fragmented somnolence, straight down into a quiet soft darkness behind my eyes. Awake, I can barely keep still for more than half a minute. There's so much to do, and so little time to get it done in - aside from my office work, there's work from the NGO I volunteer in, stuff to look over for my dad, Luis's plays to read and critique, a guest column for my old high school's paper, and my own list of articles and fiction pieces that I want to write.   I have a vague suspicion that I may be very very slightly manic-depressive - at least, every time I feel like this it is usually the prelude to a plunge downward. Outside I feel as if I'm moving so fast, I'm vibrating; inside I feel as if everything is pristine, untouched, perfectly still. It's a fierce calm, all right - one that I am holding on to with two desperate hands. Once it slips away I will fall back down into endless days of lethargy and sadness, and  I don't have time .   I'm so sick of being like this, of flaring up so brightly only to burn out. My God, I'm so tired of waiting to fall.  Even more than being sick and tired - sometimes I'm scared that when I fall this time, I won't have the strength to get up again, no matter how long I wait, or how much I want it.

      I have five different articles I want to write and post, but I am dead tired and, after all, I am just killing time until I leave work. Generally I come in at 7:30AM and leave at 6:30PM. Discounting the one-hour lunch break mandated by law, that makes it an even 10-hour workday. Ten hours a day, five days a week - I'm pulling a fifty-hour workweek, and that doesn't count the time I spend commuting (because my house is so far from my workplace that it might as well be in another province - or another state, depending on your viewpoint).   Before you ask, no, I don't get paid overtime. This is the Philippines, remember. Good labor practices are always a matter of theory rather than application.  So no real update from me today, except for something I nicked off  urlLink Noelle :    Three Things You Probably Didn't Know About Me :  1. I didn't know FM radio existed until I was fourteen. 2. I am in love with Johnny Depp. 3. I was nearly recruited into a modeling agency in KL.   Three Things That Don't Really Matter   1. I will never have perfect hair. 2. I will never find out what my exes (ex-boyfriends, ex-lovers, ex-crushes, etc.) really thought about me. 3. I don't like Starbucks' Mango Tea Frappé.   Three Things I Tell Myself To Make Me Happy   1. I'm smart.  2. There will always be someone uglier and fatter than me. 3. I bet this would make a hilarious story.

      I will not be pragmatic and useful and political today. I am in my office, bound by my brown-nosing timecard, which will faithfully record the exact time I slip past the door and into the elevator and out into a world that has a sky. At precisely five o'clock, however, I will be free again, and I will no longer be Reichel, Technical Assistant for a government agency - I will be rei, dipping my toes in the wind to see where it will take me.  I'm cheating, of course. I know where it is taking me tonight.  Tonight it is taking me to Baguio, city on a hill, where there are strawberries and peanut brittle and shopping bazaars and flowers so vivid that you cannot believe they have been cut, and so cheap that you can have them by the armful. I will go and have dinner with my parents and their friends first - a sort of apologetic good-bye, because tonight is their last night in Manila before they take off for their honeymoon in Geneva - and then K and I will meet up and go to the terminal. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing - I did not know until yesterday that we were actually going - so I wasn't able to take leave on Monday. I will be heading back again, alone, on Sunday -  but first, this madcap weekend. When was the last time I cried  Let's go!  and just went, laughing? I can hardly remember, through the haze of events that has been the past nine months.  Reichel, Technical Assistant, MBA graduate, BA in Political Science, editor-in-chief of several publications, responsible student and dutiful daughter, will not be here this weekend. Try her number again on Monday.  rei, dancer-in-rain, pointer-out of ridiculous things, funky-hat-wearer, lover-of-red, is here.

      Will post about  Peter Pan  another time. For now -  My friend Yaz and I were exchanging comments in her blog once about willful ignorance - she had a workmate who refused to read anything about wars or genocide or hunger or terrorism, on the grounds that she could not see how her knowing these things could help. Which makes sense, in a brutally honest way. You and I and our ten million friends, sitting in safe places with food and clothing and education - what are we doing that has an impact on the people we read about? It's like unnecessary torture, sometimes - back in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks, there was a glut of information - horrible, heartwrenching information about people calling out of the wreckage to tell their family 'I love you'; about people milling in the streets, terrified that the sky was falling; about people asking  why why why, what have we done to deserve this  and no one being able to answer. Laya told us:  I don't want to hear anything or read anything anymore. I want to curl up in bed with my hands over my ears.  We know so much, and yet we are unable to change what is happening.  Sometimes I come across accounts like  urlLink Riverbend  and  urlLink Raed in the Middle , and words fail me - I am caught in a "nightmare of words", as Riverbend says. My heart cracks and folds, but my hands remain still, or engaged in mundane, useless things. How do I justify my anger and sympathy when I am still here, alive and indifferent?  Right now I feel as if I should say the same thing I told myself about my relationship with E - this wasn't worth losing my innocence for.

      Posted late, but celebrated right on time: happy 21st birthday to my best friend, my worst enemy, and the only person in the world who has ever seen me dance the Running Man. Hey,  urlLink freakchild .   I told you once that if we hadn't been born sisters we would probably never have become friends, because we are so disparate in nature. Knowing what I do now, and with every single year more we have together, I tell you this - and I have never been more sincere:  Out of all the people I have ever known, know now, or will ever come to know, I would still choose you to be my sister. Thank you for being you.

      Watched  Peter Pan  last night with K and adored it way too much; I had to keep reminding myself of my age as we left the theatre, because I kept on squeeing over the Peter Pan/Wendy scenes. You think you're all grown up, but you'll never really lose that inner teeny fangirl.   I definitely want to write more about it later, but for now, a snippet of an interview with Jeremy Sumpter (who played Peter Pan) and Rachel Hurd-Wood (who played Wendy). They strike sparks off each other, apparently off-cam as well as on:   Jeremy : Me and Rachel want to do Romeo and Juliet together.  Rachel :I don’t want to do it, do I.  Jeremy : Yeah, you do. (to members of the press) Wouldn’t it be good if me and Rachel did Romeo and Juliet together?  Rachel : It’s already been done, hasn’t it?  Jeremy : Well so has Peter Pan, hah!   Rachel : Yeah but ... oh, shut up.  Jeremy : And so has Lord of the Rings, hah!  Rachel : No it hasn’t.  Jeremy : It’s already been on the theatres twice.  Rachel : It’s a trilogy, you fool.  Jeremy : Oh yeah.  Definitely going to buy the DVD, and maybe watch it again. I suppose this is the part where everybody starts denying they know me.

      The thing about art is that it's difficult to take home. I learned how to love it in college, by a teacher who talked about art the way other people talk about fashion or books or cellphone models; she was so convinced that it was necessary that to suggest otherwise would have drawn a blank look from her. And yet despite her strong convictions and a rather inspiring book on art by Jeanette Winterson, I find myself still unable to take that final step that will lead to my owning a piece of art - a painting, a sculpture, a mixed-media interpretation of something. My rather footloose lifestyle is part of the reason - I cannot imagine carting works of art from country to country, house to house. There is something about good art that seems to disdain such treatment, the way you cannot pair, say, caviar, with cheap soda crackers and grape Kool-Aid.   Price, of course, is the second part of the reason, although perhaps a significantly smaller part. As someone once pointed out to me, if you really want something, price is no object. Art is not yet a necessity for me - given an amount of money to lavish on myself, I would spend it on a spa, books, clothes, shoes, accessories, and CDs. Only then would I begin to think  Hey, yeah, I should go look for a painting I like .   For the noncommittal art enthusiasts such as I, galleries are heaven. The Vargas Museum in UP is amazing, considering that it only charges PhP10  (that's less than 5 cents) per entry. My favorite painting is a seascape by Felix Resurreccion-Hidalgo, which - unlike most other seascapes - features nothing but sea and sky, blending together in turbulent shades of blue. After I saw that painting I went out into UP's beautiful tree-lined main street, tipped back my head, and stared at the sky for the longest time. You have no idea sometimes how beautiful the world is until you've seen it through an artist's eyes.  Lately, though, I have been unable to visit any galleries - too tired, too busy, too harassed. If you like art - or even if you don't, and you just want to rest your eyes with something lovely - then online art galleries are a dream come true. Granted, they are to art what fast food is to  haute cuisine , but just like fast food, they're filling nevertheless.   Found a new one today -  urlLink Pinoy Art , featuring some contemporary artists. I am particularly enamored of Rafael Cusi's   urlLink Palayan   (Ricefield) and   urlLink Tabing Dagat   (Seaside) series, as well as Romeo Tabuena's   urlLink Girl with Butterflies, Mexico  . I have a feeling that if I could see the real paintings, I would be overcome with a strong desire to walk out again into the sunshine and stare at the sizzling blue summer sky.

      [A copy of my letter to  urlLink G , who never fails to ask the most interesting questions.]  G:  Midway into the heat of election fever here in the Philippines and I was all atwitter yesterday because I managed to have a decent conversation with a cute guy. Awhile ago he asked "rei, how tall *are* you exactly?" Personal interest! Of such small insignificant things is the joy of my day composed. I bask in my shallowness.  But out of the shallowness and back into the depths, for you want to know about Poe. By this I assume you want to know:  (a) Who the hell is he, in the context of Philippine society; (b) What the hell he thinks he's doing, running for president; and (c) How the hell he plans to run the country.  Since I love you dearly and I owe you for having ditched you for chocolate (but it was GOOD chocolate, G - and it was a freebie!), I will wrench my meandering thoughts away from Corporate Cutie and attempt to summarize the wonder and confusion that is the Poe candidacy.    (a) Who is Fernando Poe, Jr.?   First of all, the  real  Fernando Poe Jr. is dead. Poe's real name is Ronald Allan Kelly Poe, and Fernando Poe Jr. was his older brother. He is the illegitimate son of a naturalized Spanish father and an American mother; this caused a great furor in the Philippines over the authenticity of his citizenship. As in America, our presidents must be natural-born citizens. The Pro-Poe camp (hee! Try saying that ten times really fast) argued that it was his father who was a naturalized citizen; as the son of a citizen, Poe is therefore a natural-born citizen. The Anti-Poe camp argued that as he was illegitimate, he would, according to Philippine law, take his mother's citizenship and was therefore American. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Poe.  In any case, the entire brouhaha was a moot point, since Poe holds a Philippine passport, pays Philippine taxes, and has purchased property in the Philippines. Personally I agree with the Supreme Court, because to tell the truth Poe is probably more Filipino than I, half-baked product of Filipino parents and a mishmash of other cultures, am.   Poe is also an actor of almost iconic status in the local film industry. He is known fondly as "Da King", and heretofore has been treated with the respect and awe normally accorded those who are protected by  lese majeste . Our local media, who are normally like moles when it comes to digging out dirt on celebrities, have left him alone for the most part up till now, publishing nothing but positive remarks on Da King. This is out of respect for Poe, say Poe's camp; his detractors, on the other hand, insist it is out of fear, citing a rumored incident years ago when Da King allegedly beat up and pissed on a journalist who had published a negative article on him.   He dropped out of second year highschool when his father died, ostensibly to help take care of his mother and his siblings, and has never gone back. He has never held public office before. In the showbiz industry, he is one of the top earners and yet pays one of the smallest income taxes. He has been married to another actor of iconic status, Susan Roces (affectionately referred to, of course, as "Da Queen") for years. They have no children, although Poe has one recently-acknowledged illegitimate son by another actress with whom he had a liaison years ago.     (b) Why is he running?   There were rumors as early as 2001 that he would be running for president (I literally wept when I heard this rumor), which remained unverified until late 2003. His name was bruited about by the top brass of the opposition, but no one really took them seriously because Poe kept on saying "I don't know" to all questions asking him to verify the rumor. ( Snark:  That's what he says to everything, so he might as well just record it and play it back at all interviews.) At an incredibly weird press conference last year, the opposition held a big bash to announce that Poe would be their standard-bearer for the May elections.   At the conference, Poe did not show up AT ALL - instead, he called the cellphone of one of the opposition party members. They put him on speakerphone, and with all microphones pressed eagerly to the mouthpiece of the cellphone, he mumbled something about being grateful for the support of the Filipino people and that he would tell them when he was ready to run. In short, it was the most pointless press conference in the history of Philippine politics, as their standard-bearer could not even verify his own appointment.  Sometime around November 2003, Poe finally agreed to run for President, and hurriedly recruited Loren Legarda - a television newscaster turned senator - as his running mate.   I am actually giving you a factual explanation of how he came to be a presidential candidate. G, I could be psychic ten times over and I am afraid I could still not tell you why Poe thinks he is qualified to run.  How do you explain the political stylings of the deluded?  Like I said before, how do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?   (c) What is his platform of government?   I'm not sure, really. One of his first proclamations was that he was anti-globalization - this, while speaking to a group of farmers. He did not elaborate. After that he remained noticeably silent on all questions regarding his platforms. Once, caught off-guard, he gave the following interview:   Reporter:  What can you say about reports that the value of the peso has dropped due to the fact that you have not yet released your plans for economic development?  Poe:  Really? The peso drops just because of that? That's new ... I didn't know that.   Reporter:  How do you propose to improve our economic situation?  Poe:  Everybody should just work really hard.  I am translating from the original Tagalog - trust me on this, he sounds more intelligent once you translate him into English.   Recently he has hired an entire armada of economic and political advisers. His political advisers are all from the opposition party, so they cannot disown him, but his economic advisers are noticeably squeamish about being identified with him. Some have openly said "We are not officially part of Poe's camp", while others skirt the issue by informing the public that their advice is offered gratis and without prejudice to any candidate who might ask them.   A few weeks ago, he made another announcement about his economic platform. This time, he said he was pro-globalization.    I am trying to be objective, but I am afraid that my subject line completely sabotages my efforts. Never mind - it is the truth. I am sure Poe is a very good man and has a heart larger than Jupiter and warmer than the sun, but in politics, as in love, it is not a good idea to let your heart run wild without your head there in the mix to rein in its more idiotic impulses.   In the meantime, I have decided. I'm voting for  urlLink Brother Eddie . According to his campaign motto,  Babangon ang Pilipinas. Maniwala ka.  [The Philippines will rise again. Believe.]  I believe.  - - -   Nota bene : In the event that you might want to read some other, more intelligent discussions on the elections, Filipino electoral behavior, etcetera - here are some links:  urlLink tin , who is linked here, points out that there is no magic formula for determining the effectivity of a president, while  urlLink dreamlessness  makes some interesting points on who the Filipino electorate listens to and why.   Hey, if you're a Filipino voter and you happen by my blog, get involved, yeah? It's easy to mock people for their choice of candidate; it's not so easy to dive in, sort through the deluge of information and  mis information, and try to make a logical choice based on what you've deduced. After this election, I will definitely have earned my right to bitch about my government.

      I quote myself:  urlLink "The official campaign period is in full swing - and when I say that, I am picturing monkeys and all manner of wild animals dangling from the chandeliers, bouncing off the walls, cartwheeling across the linoleum. In short, I am visualizing pure chaos, a literal mad carnival."    I love it when I am right. In the aftermath of at least one part of our national elections - we have twelve newly-proclaimed senators, although the posts of President and Vice-President are still empty as Congress begins its official canvas of votes today - there is the usual slew of articles doing pseudo-political analysis. Vitriol has been kept to a minimum, despite the fact that our elections were marked with violence - there were over a hundred election-related deaths this year. What can I say, eventually you get tired of screaming for change. As my sister says whenever she slips up,  Sorry, tao lang.  [Sorry - I'm only human.]  I am particularly amused by these two articles, analyzing the political campaigns of top senatorial vote-getter  urlLink Manuel "Mar" Roxas II  (I know it's a horrible nickname, but no one else in the Philippines seems to have caught on to it, so ... ) and the daughter of one of the country's political elite,  urlLink Pia Cayetano .   Senator Roxas - I salute you, sir; you are worthy of your degree from Wharton. I *was* quite irritated by his campaign ads, to be honest - I did not see any logical reason why the former Secretary of Trade and Industry, grandson of a former president  and  son of a former senator should be hopping and bopping around to a tune that is the Philippine equivalent of, say, a song by Sum 41.  Not to be a mindless loyalist,  I told my mother,  But I know he did a good job when he was with the DTI. I would have voted for him based on that alone. What is with this shaking of his senatorial booty on national television?  However, it appears that there is indeed  urlLink a method to his madness . A pretty amazing branding exercise any way you look at it, really -  and  with rather gutsy people behind it. Imagine telling a former Secretary of the state  Sir, people have no clue who you are. You've gotta learn how to dance.  (If I start mis-typing things, it is because I am laughing so hard. I swear, life in the Philippines = Never Boring.)   For the record, Senator Roxas dances like a white boy. With all due respect, sir, you  do  need to learn how to dance.   Also noteworthy - although perhaps also illegal - is  urlLink Pia Cayetano's campaign strategy . While she is pretty and carries the name of a respected political figure, both of which count for much in the Philippine political arena, her problem was that people had no clue who she was - she was even more unknown than Roxas. While Roxas's unfamiliarity to the voting populace was due to his natural inhibitions - he is a very private person - Pia Cayetano was a name no one had ever heard of before. A few years ago Roxas was a congressman who rose to the public eye as one of the "Spice Boys" - a group of young scions of political dynasties who made waves in Congress due to their aggressiveness and their looks (we are a very fangirly society - we fangirl our politicians, our religious leaders, our mutineers ...); Pia Cayetano had never before held public office. As the article says, she appealed to the upper curve of society: she was pretty, she was well-bred, she was educated ( magna cum laude , UP Law School - the local equivalent of Yale or Harvard). However, it is the lower curve of society that composes the greater portion of the voting populace, which meant that she had to find some way to connect with them. Emotionally manipulative, I grant you, but effective. As the article's source points out, people remember her as  Maamo ang mukha, maganda, may hubog naman ang katawan  (kind-faced, beautiful, and curvy) - this is an actual quote. As I said, it worked: she is one of the  urlLink top six vote-getters in the senatorial race .  I could be negative about this and bemoan the fact that relatively worthy candidates have to stoop to cheap tactics to get themselves voted into office, but it's too early to be pessimistic. As a matter of fact - I'll be laughing about this all day.   [ EDIT : More on what Philippine political life looks like,  urlLink here  - scroll down to the section titled "Silly or Smart?" Unfortunately I was not diligent enough to cover the entire campaign / election period, but fortunately there are people in the media with the same sense of humor as mine.  As for a more serious look at Philippine political issues, you can check out  urlLink this site , which provides - well, at first glance, anyway - unbiased information on all candidates. There are a few guides to voting wisely, which I appreciated, and links to sites which help voters learn about their candidates' track records in public governance, if any. Pity it wasn't publicized enough, but who was going to pay attention to the serious stuff when you could watch senators dancing the local equivalent of the Macarena onstage? Be honest - you wouldn't have, either.]

      I've always wanted to write about the more interesting people and events that I've come across, but never really knew how to start. There are so many of them, honestly. Within the past five years alone, I've got stories enough to write a travel journal - I just don't know which one to write first. Yaz got me kickstarted on this one a few days ago, while we were chatting - she mentioned casually that she wanted to go to Nepal, and as it so happens, I've been there. I started enthusing about some of the more interesting parts of the trip - the "walking leaves", as we called the people who carried bundles of leaves on their backs (the bundles were so big that all you could see was a pair of legs beneath them, hence our nickname); the three-day trek through a Nepali forest on the back of an elephant; waking up in the wee sma's to watch the sun rise over Everest; walking through Kathmandu and having to dodge the cows, which lumber about the main streets in the smug knowledge that they are considered "holy" and therefore untouchable.  Write about it in your journal,  Yaz urged.  However - I being the wordy sonofagun that I am - I quickly figured that the entire trip (it only lasted about a week, I think) would not fit into a single entry. There was simply too much of it; I had to pick one memory of Nepal to talk about. The one that stands out most is one that appeals to me on a lot of levels - as a story, as a children's rights issue, as a cultural quirk, as a women's rights issue: the story of the child goddesses of Kathmandu.  First, a brief explanation of why we were there in the first place: my father used to work in the  urlLink Food & Agriculture Organization 's  urlLink regional office in Bangkok  - a job that would have him flying off to various parts of the world at a moment's notice. Pretty glamorous on the surface, but not for a family man - it got to the point where he would be gone six months out of a year, and doing so much overtime at the office when he  was  in the country that we barely saw him. To remedy this, he began taking us along on some of his trips - which meant that we were out of school two months of a year, but my mother argued that the trips were educational, and the school eventually gave in.   The Nepal trip was part of a three-week tour of South Asia: we were supposed to start off in Nepal, then move on to Bangladesh, then Pakistan, then finally India, as my father monitored and assessed  urlLink Grameen Bank  operations in the rural areas of these countries. (As it turned out, we were unable to complete the trip; my paternal grandfather died a day or so before we were supposed to leave Nepal for Bangladesh, and we had to return to the Philippines in a hurry.) My father, typically, had made no arrangements for us while we accompanied him, so our first few days were spent in a jeep, touring the Nepali countryside. A few days later, one of his colleagues' wives called up our hotel room; her husband had noticed that we were growing increasingly bored of seeing nothing but mountainscapes and poor people (we were stereotypical well-off brats, sorry), and suggested that she take us around Kathmandu.  Off we went, then, on a walking tour of Kathmandu. The office had offered us a car and a driver, but since the streets of Kathmandu were crowded with people and cows and whatnot, our hostess pointed out that it would be much faster - not to mention more interesting - if we took taxis and trishaws instead. She was a lovely guide (I've forgotten her name, but I'm sure it started with an O): with her at the helm, we managed to get warm milky tea at local restaurants, go shopping at colorful markets, and meet tradespeople and local schoolchildren.   On perhaps our second or third day together, Ms. O took us walking in a part of the city that had plenty of interesting buildings. One of them was particularly fascinating - made of stone, it rose like a palace in the middle of an otherwise ordinary-looking district. It was high and imposing, with intricate carvings on its columns; its walls were high, its wooden gates opening slightly to allow us to peek into a grand, cobblestoned courtyard. It was so intimidating, in fact, that we assumed it would be one of those sacred places that tourists were not allowed to enter.  Imagine our surprise, then, when Ms. O walked up to the gate and rang a bell. After a brief exchange in Nepali, she turned to us and waved us in.  Come,  she said.  We're going to meet the child goddess of Kathmandu.    It was one of the most unbelievable and irresistible invitations I have ever heard in my lifetime - even my mother, who then bordered on being a rather fundamentalist Christian, was seduced by the sheer wonder of the opportunity.  Is she really a goddess?  I asked her, whispering, as we crossed the wide courtyard.    Of course not,  she answered.  There's only one God.  Her answer, however, was less assertive than it normally would have been - she, like my sister and I, was entranced by the fantasy. It was one of those caught-in-the-moment things - it was Kathmandu, we were walking in palace grounds that seemed to have been transported from another time, Ms. O  had  addressed the person on the other side with deference and respect ... for all we knew, right? For all we knew.  We walked into the palace of stone, our footsteps echoing. Deep inside, we were abruptly wrenched from our fantasy of being transported back in time by the commonplace sight of a line of laundry strung incongruously across one of the balconies, and a woman doing her wash beneath it. Ms. O stopped and made an inquiry, presumably asking permission to visit with the goddess. The woman - who we later learned was one of the goddess's relatives - yelled something at someone inside the palace's private quarters, and got a hollered response, which she transmitted to Ms. O.  What is she saying?  we asked, a little anxiously; we were Bangkok brats, aware of and respectful of cultural and spiritual taboos. Aside from which, and not to belabor the point - who wants to anger a goddess?   She is saying that the goddess does not wish to be disturbed,  Ms. O said, looking thoughtful.  But maybe if we give an offering ...    Our eyes lit up. In Bangkok, people offered food and sweets to the spirits every day; this was familiar territory. My sister had a doll, I had some candy, and Ms. O dug out some money in hopes of enticing the goddess into making an appearance. She displayed this to the relative, who immediately yelled another message down. Within a few minutes, the goddess emerged - a small, lovely little Nepali girl of no more than nine or ten years old, dressed in red and gold. She moved immediately to a dais on which was placed a red-and-gold pillow - her pedestal, upon which she was accustomed to receiving her supplicants. Ms. O presented our offerings, she graciously - and wordlessly - accepted them, bowed her head politely, and then got up and darted away again.  Outside of the palace, Ms. O told us the story of the child goddess - I forget the details, but apparently one of the deities of the area had chosen a girlchild as her preferred incarnation. Thereafter, the town held selection rituals for would-be goddesses, similar to those held for the Dalai Lama: baby girls from all over would be brought to the temple and put through a rigorous screening process. The infant who passed the test was then proclaimed the new goddess.    What happens to the former girl?  I asked, as it was becoming obvious that the deity's representative did not remain a goddess forever. Ms. O looked at me, her eyes serious and a little sad.    She is a goddess only as long as she does not shed blood,  she explained. The girls were guarded zealously against cuts, abrasions, bruises - goddesses could not be blemished, nor could they bleed.  However, once she reaches menarche, she is no longer qualified to be the child goddess, as she is no longer a child.    As child goddess, the infants and their families are provided with everything they could possibly want or need. They are moved into the palace, they are provided with servants, they are given food; the girl is plied with offerings and adoration from the minute she is proclaimed goddess. When she reaches menarche, however, all of this is withdrawn. Her family must move out of the palace and resume normal lives; the former goddess becomes a girl. According to Ms. O, many previous child goddesses have gone insane, or suffered severe emotional problems - how could you not, having undergone such a drastic change in status?   We were halfway back to the hotel when I turned to my mother.  Mommy,  I said,  I'm glad I'm not a goddess. I thought I'd like to be, and get money and toys and candy - but I think I like being me so much better.   [ EDIT : In case this story may seem a little too fantastic to believe, I've done a search on Google and found a few articles on the child goddess, also known as the Kumari Devi. You can go  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  for more information on her. She's for real, folks. There are even pictures of her temple, which is good because even  I  thought I was dreaming - it was such a surreal sort of memory.]

      Apparently the main server is down; I can't connect to the Internet. Since I cannot work without the Internet - it has become one of the crutches of my working life - I am sitting here, typing up a journal entry. You  know  you're addicted to journalling when something happens and the first thing you think is  Gee, this would make such a great journal entry .   A journal: a catalogue of days, an album of memories. The nice thing about journals is that you pick-and-choose what to remember, and how to remember them. Someone pointed out to me once that you don't report the facts accurately in your journal, not really - but that's to be expected. I forget the precise term for it, but in the social sciences it's accepted that first-person accounts are biased, due to the teller's presence and/or participation in the event. Therefore reading journals comes with that caveat - that you are not reading an objective account of an event, but a subjective one.   Despite its inbuilt inaccuracy as a memory-keeper, I love my journal - both the online and offline versions. As I suspect most people do, I keep two versions of my journal - the online blog for regular events, and issues that require an audience; my offline, handwritten journal for personal issues, stories that are too personal or painful to tell while there are eyes watching, and random ideas that are too incoherent to post online. A friend of mine speculated once that I must have a secret journal, where I write down the spicier details of my life. Alas, no - my offline journal is actually less exciting than my online one, as I write in it less often (the really spicy details, to tell the truth, all lie in my private e-mail). The tales of my life that are untold remain untold, because I lack the determination and maturity to find the words that will translate them effectively from memory to story. Being molested in my own home by a close friend when I was nineteen, my dreams about abandonment and falling and cold electronic societies, the time my paternal grandmother rejected me as a granddaughter, being harassed in school when I first returned from Bangkok because I could not speak Tagalog properly, various memories of being abused as a child - so many stories I have to tell, and yet I refrain from doing so because I cannot tell them yet without sounding like a victim. Pardon my pride, which is one of my besetting sins, but I cannot - I  will  not - I refuse to sound like a victim in my own journal.   It's been almost fifteen years since I first started journalling - as that stereotypical ten-year-old girl with her pastel, daintily-padlocked San Rio diary and multi-colored pens, scribbling earnestly to "Dear Diary". I never thought I'd make it from then to now, still writing, but in a medium that lets me wander freely through others' thoughts and concerns, and correspond with people whose interests and passions mirror mine. With that - Belated happy birthday,  synesthetique  - conceived as  luminae  and renamed halfway through, you have always been a haven of sorts. Here I am strong, and witty, and articulate; wrapped in the membrane of my prose, I can retell the painful, the irritating, the frustrating, and the glorious moments of my life without resorting to useless things like tears or tantrums. Here I dissect myself - who and what I am right now, vis-a-vis who and what I wish I was, and find a way to make the edges overlap. Here I find a forum for the issues that move me, and people who challenge and support the things I say.   I am hovering on the brink of my mid-twenties, and I no longer start my entries with "Dear Diary", but here I am yet, journalling. Four countries, several houses and apartments, and multiple love lives later, with a larger vocabulary and a more complicated heart - but still me, and still with that inborn need to scribble things down. I wonder if I'll ever stop needing my journal.  I hope not.  Later: Kathmandu and child goddesses, for Yaz.

      As long as there are human beings with free will, there will be children running around with names like  urlLink these . Jett is not so bad, but Ahmet Emuukha Rodan? Reignbeau? Elijah Bob Patricius Guggi Q? Obviously these parents were all on crack.  I realize I don't have a lot of room to point and laugh, since I am one of those people who have an unusual name (my name is, according to my father, the last name of an obscure classical guitarist who was playing on TV at the time of my birth.  So  obvious you used to be a hippie, Dad. Just sayin'). Nevertheless, I must give my parents props - this is apparently a shortened form of the term 'proper respect' - for rejecting various inappropriate name suggestions that were made during my conception. For example, my cousin wanted to name me Eeyore. Can you imagine?  No, you can't.

      I think I need to start taking sleeping pills, although my mother - who is a nurse - is vehemently against regulating normal body functions with drugs. Normally I agree with her, but I haven't exactly been sleeping well lately, and I'm afraid I'll start sleepwalking again. On the one hand, I'm pretty sure that someone in the house will stop me before I get to the street, but just in case - if you see a bleary-eyed rei wandering where she obviously has no right to wander while in sleepwear, please rope her in and deliver her back home.   Thank you.  At any rate, I am a little disoriented today. Last night a cousin's ex-boyfriend came to our house literally in the dead of night; the first words out of his mouth were  Look, I just wanted to know, is GP really dead?   Since N, the ex-boyfriend, has a history of being slightly shady, my sister and I stared at him from inside the locked gate of our house, wondering what the hell he was on.  I'm not kidding,  he said, sounding slightly hoarse.  Here - someone messaged me this afternoon -   and he pushed his cellphone through our gate, indicating a text message on the screen. We quickly read through the message, which said something along the lines of  Let us pray for the soul of our dear departed friend GP. She was hit by a truck on Saturday morning ...  and looked back at N, still befuddled.    We have no idea,  my sister C told him.  We haven't seen or heard from her in months. Last we heard, she'd gone back home to the province.  She started to unlock the gate, but I held her back; the situation was so surreal that almost anything could happen.   Through the bars of the gate, N told us his story: from their province, our uncle had sent GP to another province to find work. He and GP had communicated regularly through calls and text messages; he had asked her if he could visit, and she had repeatedly rebuffed him, saying it wasn't time yet. The last time he'd heard from her was Friday evening; when he received no word from her over the weekend, he began to worry. On Monday he received the text message announcing GP's death, which was when he decided to head for our house to confirm the rumor.  We've been messaging and calling our uncle since last night, and trying to contact my cousin's phone, but to no avail - no one's picking up or answering. Up to now, I have no idea what's going on. It may be true, in which case I have just lost a cousin that I never really knew and therefore will not truly mourn. If it is not true, then it is a cruel joke or some sort of misguided call for attention. Don't get me wrong, but between the two, I would rather that the rumor were true. If my cousin were indeed still alive, I don't want to think about what kind of twisted logic would drive her to construct such a morbid lie, and I don't want my family involved in whatever she's gotten herself into now.  If ever I wondered whether psychosis really  did  run in my family's genes ... well, rest assured. I no longer wonder - I am  damn  sure.

      As a follow-up to the  urlLink earlier   urlLink discussion , please note that there are  urlLink further developments . I suppose "It was just a harmless prank" and "Saddam used to do so much worse to them, anyway" weren't really going over well with the public, so now it's "We were ordered to do so."   Cry me a  river , Lynndie. A big, deep river called de Nile.  [ EDIT : Ceres P. Doyo did a good job of explaining  urlLink why there was massive outrage  against the soldiers, and the US in general. I am not a generic America-hater; far from it. However, her article encapsulates perfectly how I feel about the situation.   On the flip side of those soldiers, however, is  urlLink General Antonio Taguba , who I admire not only because he is a Filipino, but because in this situation at least, he proved to be a man of honor. The sad thing - or the wonderful thing, depending on which side of the Pacific Ocean you are - about Taguba is that he might not have thrived in the Philippines the way he is doing now in the US. I am proud he is of Filipino ethnicity, but also glad for him - that he is in a country that values and rewards honesty and justice. I would like to say the same thing about my country, but the very fact that our choices were so limited during the past elections - well, it speaks for itself.]

      Some changes have been made to the links -  urlLink john  has been removed because he's made his journal friends-only. As I am not really a friend of his, merely an amused reader, that would make the link pretty much useless. Farewell, John - and the times I spent howling with laughter at some of your entries.  I added the link to  urlLink JP's office blog , which will stay there unless he tells me to take it off. They post poetry, musings, rants and raves - it's a bunch of people communicating online, when they all work in the same office. I find that both amusing and intriguing - along the same line with me e-mailing my workmate instead of talking to her, or messaging my mother on her cellphone because I'm too lazy to get out of my room and try to find her. The wonders of modern communication, people.  Also here is  urlLink Noelle , who was an orgmate back in college. (To those unfamiliar with the lingo of Philippine college life, an "orgmate" usually refers to someone who belonged to the same school organization. There were regional organizations, which grouped together people from the same region or province; issues-oriented organizations, which concentrated on promoting awareness of issues such as gender equality or the environment; religious organizations; interest-based organizations, which centered around developing members' talents and skills in specific areas; and academic organizations, which concentrated on major areas of study like philosophy, geography, etc. Noelle and I were in the same academic org, whose membership was limited to political science majors only.) She and I had been members of the same org for a few months but had never really crossed paths -  that  happened when I scribbled a scathing comment in the margins of one of her pieces. It wasn't very nice of me - I was in one of my more sarcastic phases, and ended up taking the pseudonym  bluestreak  (as in "cussing a blue streak") because at that point, I'd pissed off enough people to know they were mentally poking pins into a voodoo doll with my name on it.   At any rate, she lobbed a cutting reply right back - which delighted my antagonistic little soul. We went back-and-forth on that for quite a while, and finally ended up liking each other. I have very few female friends who I got to know by initially antagonizing them, so Noelle stands out in my memory for that reason.  A lot of my male friends, however, I have gotten to know by either initially antagonizing them, or not liking them very much and snubbing them. So that romance-novel convention about being in deep abiding love with the person you squabble with the most?   Obviously not a problem with me.

      You know what I hate most about violence? Like the cliché goes,  urlLink it breeds more violence . Abused children become abusers. Kick a dog and it will try to bite you back. It's not hard to figure out.   Where do we go from here? On the American soldiers' side, there seems to be  urlLink little remorse . Like I told Yaz earlier, I think some of them have gotten to the point where they no longer see the Iraqi prisoners as human. It's there in the way they talk about them:  I don't know whether the one we shot in the chest is dead yet,  an American soldier wrote in her diary.  A lot of times I get people asking me  How can your God be a loving God when innocent people get hurt and die?  and my answer is  Well, didn't you read the fine print? He's not just a loving God, he's a just one.  Justice demands payment - and sometimes, the people who have to pay are not the ones who racked up the bill.   This is a case in point. Nick Berg did  nothing  to the Iraqi people; he was a civilian posted in a war-torn zone as a part of his job. Yet he, not the soldiers in those horrible pictures, was beheaded; BBC says his head was "sawn off".   The point is, God doesn't cause pain. He set the rules and defined the boundaries - but it is our choices and our actions that set off events, that bounce back on ourselves and other people. When innocent people suffer, it is because someone made the wrong choice.

      It's the small things, sometimes.  Today was a crappy day, pretty much. I'd volunteered as a poll-watcher for yesterday's elections, so my entire day was spent waiting around in the broiling sun and waiting for people to finish voting. The polling precincts closed at 3PM, but then we still had to check the ballots and tally the votes. All in all, checking 126 ballots and tallying their votes took us six hours - after which we still had to help the Board of Election Inspectors (or the BEI, which is composed of public school teachers) verify their numbers and the tally sheets. It should give you an idea of how clunky our electoral machinery is if I tell you that we were the second-fastest precinct in counting and verifying the ballots, and we finished at past 11PM. This, after beginning our day at around 6:30AM, when we had to witness the opening of the ballot boxes to ensure that they were empty.  In short, I'd had less than five hours' sleep, after a prolonged weekend that I'd given myself in order to recuperate from a nasty case of the flu. This morning I woke up and turned on the TV to get updates on the election, and found to my profound disgust that Arroyo and FPJ are  urlLink neck-and-neck in the polls . Worse,  urlLink Jinggoy Estrada  has made it into the top 12 as a senatorial candidate, which means - be afraid, Philippines - that he will be one of our senators. WHY? WHY WHY WHY?  My mother, who had been pollwatching for one of the slower precincts, woke up late and was rushing around to get dressed so she could drop me off at the MRT station. Five minutes before we were supposed to leave, she suddenly realized that she couldn't find her driver's license, prompting a house-wide search. Almost 30 minutes past the time I was supposed to leave, her license was still missing - so I poked my head in the door and told her it was fine, I'd go off to work on my own.   I got to work only to find all doors locked; I had to wait about ten minutes for someone else to come in and unlock my door for me. Then - as is usually the case when you take a day off for any reason (which is why I HATE taking sick leave unless I can barely get out of bed) - I came in to find a pile of things-to-do waiting for me, some of which were due last week. While I was working my way through them, I realized that I'd have to download and print out the office e-mail, since the workmate who usually does it is on leave today. Not a big thing, unless - as is the case with us - your printer operates on manual feed, and can handle only one paper at a time. If that is the case, then downloading and printing 30 e-mails (and their attachments!) will take half an hour, at the least.   It was in this state of mind that I paused from work to check my phone - and found that I'd had a couple of missed calls and a few messages. Both calls and messages were from my mother - apparently she'd found her license a few minutes after I'd left.  I found my license, I can drop you off now,  she said in the first message, and in the second,  Where are you? I'll meet you and drop you off .   Such a small thing, but warming nevertheless. I hate taking public transportation, so my mother - to help me avoid frittering away all my money on cab fare - drives me to the MRT station every day. I hadn't really expected her to do it for me today, since she was so tired from last night's pollwatching - but knowing that she wanted to, and tried to call me so that I wouldn't have to take public transport anyway, makes me feel, weirdly enough, loved.   Now I'm going to go harass the cashier for my paycheck so that I can treat my mother to a CD or flowers or a good meal, dammit.

      Back in Manila, but still with a touch of the weightlessness of my madcap weekend hanging about the soles of my feet and somewhere behind my eyes. We did not leave Friday evening, as we planned; all buses out of Manila to Baguio were fully booked all the way up to 9AM. Instead we hung out at Whistlestop, a 24-hour bar/restaurant, recounting our wacky childhood at Community of Learners. (As happens quite often, I ended up losing much of my dignity, courtesy of the recollection of childhood antics. How is it that I remember being a quiet, shy child, when so many of my classmates remember a crazy loud girl who rollerskated full-tilt down the school driveway and chased grasshoppers through the lawn? Clearly they are all schizophrenic.)  We ended up not taking the bus at all, but a cramped van whose driver insisted on packing us in, four people to a row - when clearly only three people could sit comfortably.  We're gonna get cricks in our necks,  K groused, as we shifted about, trying to find a comfortable way to sleep. There was a brief interlude where B, her brother, attempted to keep me awake, but in the end all was futile - K and I had come straight to the terminal from work, and we had all been awake for twenty-four hours straight. Comfort or no, we all slipped off within the first hour.  We finally arrived at Bagiuo seven hours later, after a few mishaps that led B to christen me a jinx - a title that I protest most energetically. It is not my fault that typhoons come, methods of transportation break down / go on strike / run out of fuel, reservations are cancelled, and roofs leak. Those are events completely beyond my control, and the fact that I am always present when they occur does not signify.  At all . It took us another hour, cruising around in a taxi with a cute and friendly driver, to find a hotel - as with all properly madcap weekends, we had not even made a reservation, nor had any clue where we would actually stay once we got there. We circled Baguio twice before finally settling on the first hotel we'd seen.  I didn't do much in Baguio - there isn't much to do, really, in less than 18 hours. K and I went shopping while B napped, and returned proudly laden with our booty, which we spread out on the bed while B obligingly oohed and aahed. After that we went out to dinner beside Burnham Park, gorging luxuriously on all manner of grilled food.  This is pleasure eating,  B said defensively in response to K's guilty exclamation of  Oh, we're so greedy!     I haven't eaten for pleasure in such a long time,  I said, chewing reflectively. There is a huge difference between going out, grabbing a latte or a sandwich, and then returning to the office, and actually sitting down, perusing a menu or a display, and then concentrating fully on eating and enjoying the people you're with. Pleasure eating is enhanced by the knowledge that you have not done this in so long; flavors are richer, fuller, augmented by the feeling of having existed so long on the metaphorical bread and water. As the  urlLink poem  goes,  bread I broke with you was more than bread .  After that we went walking in Burnham Park. The evening was cool, made slightly chilly by the soft wind sweeping in off the lake. There were boaters, and B asked if we were going boating.  Over our dead bodies,  K and I cried - K because physical exertion (you are supposed to row your own boat) is not her idea of a vacation, and I because I had gone boating there before and gotten cornered in a remote part of the lake by some hooligans. We walked, instead, through lanes filled with families and young couples and children running alongside us asking if we wanted to boat, to buy hats bags shoes sunglasses, lined with trees trimmed with lights. In the distance, a huge searchlight roamed the sky, lacking only Batman's logo to make it the Bat-signal.  It's Decades,  laughed B, naming one of the more popular bars in Quezon City.  There's a Decades Baguio now! And I bet if you stepped in, all the regulars would be there ...    And because it was that particular night, in that particular spot in Baguio, I thought,  Yeah, maybe .   The next day I woke up early. K and B were supposed to have breakfast with me, then drop me off at the station, but they'd slept late the night before so I couldn't wake them. I slipped out alone instead, and headed over to Pancake House, which was a brief walk away from our Hotel. This Pancake House was particularly delicious - it was on the second floor, and most customers chose to eat out on the terrace, breathing the crisp air and watching the cars pass by. I had cinnamon toast and eggs and hash browns and extra-crisp bacon and coffee, and everything tasted like ambrosia.   There was so much I didn't do - I didn't eat strawberries, or buy flowers, or browse through the markets, or climb hills just to look down and laugh with the exhilaration of having gotten so high. In the terminal, waiting for my bus to arrive, I took down the numbers of hotels and took note of their rates. I do not know when, exactly, but I will be going back.  In the meantime, I have peanut brittle and chocolate crinkles. If anyone wants some, all they have to do is visit me here at my office.

      As I type this,  urlLink Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is being inaugurated as my country's fourteenth president . I had a lot to say earlier, but a lot of what I have to say is unprintable. Therefore I shall not say anything.  I have an insane amount of work for someone who is LEAVING THIS OFFICE TODAY, which contributes to the not saying anything - because what is the point of a blog, after all, if you muzzle your unprintable thoughts when you write in it. It is more like I am percolating my thoughts, and waiting to see if they produce anything a little less hostile. If moods had physical manifestations, six-inch steel spikes would be bristling out of my skin right now and white flame would be shooting from my eyes - not a very pretty sight, but useful nonetheless, as people would know not to approach me.  Hence: Arroyo is the new Philippine president, there is a typhoon on our shores, I have had less than three hours of sleep, I have caught at least three people conversing with my breasts rather than my face, and if  one more person  tries to call me a cutesy nickname instead of my  given nickname  - which is only one syllable and does not contain any alien phonetics - they will be slowly and painfully relieved of their vocal cords.

      The word of the day is sex - let's go back to your apartment, I need to have a word with you.  Don't look at me like that - it was an old pick-up line and it was dying to have a make-over. Besides, it was something that occurred to me while browsing through  urlLink this entry  in  urlLink the Ferrett's  journal.   I'm back, after a pretty grueling weekend - the last couple of weeks were a rather busy buildup to that weekend, really. A workmate, T, and I, were assigned to come up for a program for the office anniversary-slash-teambuilding, which would be held in  urlLink Tagaytay  (er ... well, with out  the well-endowed woman in a bikini). At first we thought it would be fun - and it was, with all the crazy ideas we had. Then reality intruded, in the form of a extremely tight budget and the realization that we were, pretty much, the youngest people in the office. Which meant that while we were doing our supertopsecret!planning, people would pop in at random moments and ask,  So, what are you guys planning to put in the program? , complete with suspicious look. After two or three such encounters, T turned to me with a wounded look and asked  Why do people think we're so evil? We wouldn't make them dress up like sheep and do a tapdance to Handel's  Water Music , for example.    Maybe the fact that you came up with that idea so easily?  I suggested.   True, they were all well-meaning, but it was a harassing experience nonetheless. Toward the end of last last week, I gave up on being meek and mild and metamorphosed into Wicked!rei.  You,  I said to one officer,  will be doing an interpretative dance. Don't worry about the costume, T and I will have it ready by Friday if we have to sew the feathers and sequins in ourselves. You,  I told another,  will be responsible for leading the group singing. You'll need to get someone to choreograph the corresponding dance.  Worried looks began blossoming on the faces of people in the office, only to flower in full-fledged panic when I brought various odd CDs to the office, offering people a choice of songs for their interpretative dances.  One officer, apparently convinced by my fine acting, actually came over to select a song. I took one look at the song he'd selected - Madonna's  Like a Virgin  - and immediately vetoed it.  Pick a more  believable  song, R,  I instructed, giving him an impudent grin in answer to his glare. rei, office bully. I shudder to think what kind of tyrant I will become once I actually gain seniority over people.  At any rate, the program went off swimmingly - I started it off by warning everyone that T and I had prepared a Plan A and a Plan B. Plan A, I explained, would be the pre-approved, tame, family-oriented program that T and I had prepared.  On the other hand,  I said,  If at any time you are bored with our program, then T and I will sit down, take a backseat, and Plan B - the interactive program - will take effect. This is where everybody gets up and has to do a presentation - interpretative dances, skits, songs, etc. So just let us know if you ever get bored, yeah?   Having effectively terrorized everyone into forced enjoyment of our program, we encountered very few glitches. Everybody was happy with the games - a trivia contest and a fast-paced game of charades -  and  with our prizes: a bag of Hershey's kisses for the winners,  urlLink Serg's Choc-Nut  (a local sweet that purports to be chocolate but tastes more like hardened peanut butter) for the losers. (Lest anyone protest that we were being too cruel to those who did not win, let me reassure them that Choc-Nut is actually a local favorite.)  T and I were completely numb with exhaustion after the program was done. She got into the car heading back to Manila and just sat there, napping, while I headed for the dining room - where everyone was having snacks and tea - and just sat there, staring off uselessly into the air. We headed for Cafe Lupe, a cafe on the hillside of Tagaytay overlooking the Taal Lake, soon afterwards for some  more  snacks and coffee. I blame exhaustion and overstress for what I did next - I ran toward the railing, leaned over it, and screamed  Jaaaack! I'm flyiiiiiing!    Having gotten that out of my system, I was more normal for the rest of our stopover at Cafe Lupe. This, of course, relieved my officemates and my boss, none of whom looked very excited about the prospect of having to rescue me in the event I suddenly took it into my head to do a swandive off the railings.   Saturday I got dolled up and headed out to a wedding I was supposed to sing at - only to stop right outside of our car, panicked, because I realized that my toes were  sinfully  ugly - I hadn't had time to go for a pedicure in ages.  We'll be late,  my mother warned, but I ignored that.  I CANNOT go to a wedding looking all glam and then having gross toes, Mother,  I pointed out, and she relented and drove me to a nearby salon, where I harassed the staff into giving me a manicure  and  a pedicure in half an hour. Feeling more human with my pretty nails, I went back into the car and on to my destination.  A note on the wedding singer stint: I'd been asked to sing at my officemate's wedding a mere two weeks before the event, and - up to two hours before the wedding - had not met the guy with whom I was supposed to do a duet. When I finally found my duet partner, he turned out to look like  urlLink Dexter  in a violently purple shirt and thick black glasses - and then he opened his mouth and you forgot all about that, because he had a lovely, rich tenor that I despaired of matching with my uneven soprano. Fortunately my prayers were heard and I managed to rise to the occasion. With one successful wedding beneath my belt, I am more confident about my next wedding-singer-stint, which will be in October at my cousin's wedding.  Hell Weekend's over, finally. Back to work - normal work - and preparing to move to my new office.  [ EDIT : I  was  going to post pictures of the view, but they turned out frighteningly big. How do I shrink them? Yaz?]  [ EDIT , part two: I friendslocked a couple of my posts in LJ, simply because I figured badmouthing someone online who cannot defend herself, even if it  was  provoked, is pretty bad form. I'll be doing the same thing in future, so if anyone wants to read those posts just let me know and I'll ... I'll work out something. I was thinking of creating a new LJ and friending that one and then giving  that  username and password out, but I'm already pretty schizophrenic online as it is so maybe not.]

      A  urlLink quick look  at the car my parents are trying to convince me to buy. In an effort to make the pitch irresistible - they know me  too  well - they told me that they would let me get the red one. (This is a huge concession on my mother's part, as usually she insists on getting white cars since the color reflects better in the dark, making it safer in general.) All weekend I've been teased and tempted with visions of a shiny new red car that would be mine, all mine -  You can do anything with it!  my mother coaxed, sounding for all the world like she was trying to convince a reluctant toddler to go to school.    Can I put a fluffy white cover on the steering wheel and the dashboard?  I asked, to test the waters.   My mother : Sure!   Rei : And have furry white-and-red giant dice dangling from the mirror?    My mother : Um ... okay, if that's what you really want.   Rei : I want to name her Chazm. That's short for Chazzy Chaz the Star, but we'll tell everyone it's short for Chelsea. And really it will be a tribute to Chester Bennington, who is cute and dorky and cool and will rock this car.   My mother , slightly less enthusiastic: Well, it  will  be your car.   Rei :  urlLink Freakchild  and I will replace the regular car light with a cover that glitters and sparkles like a disco ball.   My mother , harassed: You realize your father will be driving this car, too.   Rei : Pfft, it doesn't bother him to stand in line to pay for our lingerie, why should it bother him to drive a glittery sparkly red car?  Therefore I was almost sold.  Until  I learned the catch - that is, I will be paying over  half  of my monthly salary for this thing for FOUR YEARS.   Four years, people. A girl who wants a car that glitters and sparkles cannot be tied down to something that takes four years to pay for. I want that red car with the deepest darkest desires of my shallow little heart, but I cannot see myself tied to a regular payment scheme and forgoing so many other opportunities for four years. Therefore my parents will have to find other ways to tempt me.   I suppose nothing really highlights my fear of commitment as much as this situation, does it.  [ Edited to add : Oh yeah, did I ever mention that I have a  urlLink Gmail  account? It has 1GB of memory and if you're not afraid of people being able to search through your mail, it's pretty cool. Apparently I can invite someone else to use it, so ... anybody want one?]

      Many Filipinos did not like Lee Kuan Yew or his blunt criticisms of Philippine sociopolitical culture, but there are times when he just  urlLink hits the nail on the head . It stings, the words "Filipinos of short memories" - but how true. How else do you explain our voting Jinggoy Estrada as a senator, even as he has a  urlLink pending graft case ? How do you explain our voting the children of  urlLink Ferdinand Marcos  into position, barely a decade after he was forcibly ejected from the country for the crimes committed by his administration? My father has a scar on the back of his head from an injury sustained from a clash with police, back when he was a student activist. When we watch movies like  urlLink Dekada '70 , his eyes cloud over with painful memory. How do we forget these things? How do we justify putting these people back in power?   Is it a tendency to forgive too easily, or - more frighteningly - is it resignation? Are we so numbed by years of mismanagement and neglect that we no longer understand that we have rights?   I love this country so much it hurts.  - - -  On another note, I have been, for some time, seriously considering creating a second journal.  Synesthetique  will remain here, but will be relegated to being a personal journal - a place where I post the "today i woke up and ate chicken and got splashed by a car - damn car" posts that Yaz and I were bitching about in chat yesterday. The second journal -  Luminae , resurrected - will contain political stuff. Not always serious - the occasional post will be composed of nothing more than a link to an article and related snark - but nevertheless, all the sociopolitical, quasi-serious contemplations and bitching will be placed there.   The thing is, it might be a little ambitious. For one thing, I've always thought of my journals as private areas - something like beanbags around a fireplace on a cold rainy evening, where people gather with mugs of spiked coffee and shots of whisky and shoot the breeze. Therefore, the only people who read this are friends of mine - and, hmm. Could I justify asking them to spend more time checking on another blog, which caters to a very special interest (ASEAN sociopolitics, with a strong bent toward Philippine political analysis)?   For another - I am highly irregular when it comes to posting. There are months when I post almost every day, and there are months that contain a single entry and nothing more. Would I have the energy or inclination to sustain two separate blogs?  (Er - which is to say, I'm asking for help. Should I or shouldn't I?)

      Such a funny thing. My sister  urlLink Freakchild  and I have been pretty vocal lately about wanting stability, about wanting something solid of our own.  I want to  know  something for sure,  she told me yesterday, when my parents held a career planning seminar for our cousins and the two of us. In our hands were blank papers, on which we were supposed to write our long-term goals; we were sitting by the curb, frustrated, because our dad had told us that while our goals were well-stated, they were all at most mid-term goals.  The problem is,  she griped,  I can't see past the end of this year. I don't know what's going to happen, I can't figure out what I want, I don't know anything.    It's funny, because we never realized until recently how transient our lives have been - touching down here, taking off, moving on.  I feel like I don't know you at all,  a friend of mine marvelled a few weeks back. I was taken aback, myself -  Haven't I ever told you about these things before?  I asked, and he said no. On the other hand, how do you fit your entire lifetime into a few years' worth of anecdotes and friendly confidences? I feel as if my life - and correspondingly, my friends' lives - are dissected into portions and organized: first chronologically, by the time period I became acquainted with each friend, and second by interest, by the particular themes and issues that each friend and I have in common. I told a friend of mine once that I never expect to know  everything  about any of them, which is true. In the period between the time we last were in touch to the time we finally meet up again, so much has happened, could have happened, should have happened - how do you explain these things?   You end up not explaining them at all, by merely picking up the surface threads and moving on. If you're lucky, you keep the communication lines open long enough to learn something deeper and more valuable about an old friend - this has happened with Yaz and JP and a few other friends who are not online. Otherwise the surface threads remain on the surface, and you start to shuffle each other into the category of "activity partners", where you remember to contact each other only when you get involved in an activity in which you know the other friend is interested, too.   It's funny, too, how the one person who started the ball rolling on all this self-realization is no longer in my life. I wonder, randomly, what he will think when we meet up again. In the five months or so that we have had absolutely no contact, I have lost weight, cut my hair, developed new interests, made new friends. I can barely remember his face or his name, some days, although there are others when a memory involving him surfaces readily enough - these, however, are rare. How quickly I forget. How swiftly my heart heals.  With all of this running through my head, I wrote down on my blank paper:  I want a steady job. I want a home of my own.  and folded it up, small, my heart's desire crumpled into lines and shoved into the corner of an old notebook. I don't know if I really want these things, after all. Maybe I'm still traumatized, after spending three months of last year virtually homeless.  I haven't unpacked my suitcases for three months,  I wept one night about a year ago, burying my face in E's shoulder.  I touch down in one place, rotate the clothes I've got in them, and then leave again. I don't want to move anymore. I don't want to leave anymore. I want to put my clothes in a closet, I want to sit down at my own table, I want to wake up in a familiar bed.    There was a moment of silence, his hand moving through my hair, before he spoke:  When I travel,  he said gently,  I never quite get used to sleeping in a bed other than my own. It's like I don't really fit there - like the pillows aren't the right shape and the bed doesn't feel right ... Oh yeah, I sleep, but I never sleep as peacefully as I do when I finally get home and lie down in my own bed, the one I've had since I was little.  On and on he went, his voice quiet, until I was no longer crying and just lay there, silent, my head still pressed against his shoulder.  One sweet memory of something I can barely see anymore. It's sad, how sometimes I reduce people to memories.  I think I'm moving again, to another job. It's not such a big move, and huge parts of me are happy about it, the way I'm happy about the greyness of the sky and how I can walk around bareheaded in the rain. It's in the same government department, and my new office will be right across the hall from where I work now. Still and all - another new place, new people to befriend, a new boss to figure out. How many people would laugh in disbelief if I told them that I hate being the new girl on the block?   I wonder when I'll stop moving, when I'll find my niche and stay there. I wonder if I'm supposed to.

      I am tired, but I rule. Why, you may ask? For two major reasons: first, I rule simply because I say so. This is a valid reason, as all my childhood friends will tell you. I rule. Period. No questions asked. (You can all also rule, but go do it in your own journals so that the throne area doesn't get crowded here. I promise I will be appropriately adoring when approaching you in your own domain.)   (  urlLink The second reason.  )  In other news: I went to the  urlLink Prisoner of Azkaban  Manila premiere yesterday - or was dragged there, rather, by one of my officemates whose sister was selling tickets for a project. The sister was happy - she managed to sell out all her tickets, because by golly there were seven of us from the office alone; I was happy, because I'd wanted to watch  Prisoner of Azkaban  but hadn't wanted to watch it alone; everybody else was happy because we had dinner at an Italian restaurant afterwards. If you are looking for spoilers, however, you will not find them here. Go watch it, and then message or e-mail me and we will squee or nitpick according to your personal preferences.  Various reactions, while watching the film:   Me : OMG Harry and Hermione are so close he is HUGGING HER SQUEEEEEE. Oh, and why does the werewolf look like a poster boy for  urlLink Sally Hansen ?   KS : Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?  Me : Dude, READ THE BOOK. Can you not see that I am busy squeeing?  J : I'm gonna lay the smackdown on this dude in front of me. Could his hair GET any bigger?  R : I do not get why everybody is so crazy about this movie, but my umbrella matches my shirt so I'm happy. Also, hot chicks! Yay.  KY : Hello, hot chick. As you can see, I am suave and intelligent and not with the rest of  these  n00bs.  Everybody : HEY.  It is interesting to note that JP thought this was all very amusing until I reminded him that my officemates are all commercial attachés, making them responsible for the future of our country's trade relations with the rest of the world.   JP : Remind me to migrate.  I have a sneaking suspicion that I will have to watch the movie again this weekend with my sister in order to understand what it was all about.

      How hard do my friends rock? SO VERY HARD. Go over right now and check out  urlLink Solemate's article  on natural family planning.  The coolest thing about all of this is that we don't even agree on how family planning should be conducted. I believe strongly that women should be the primary arbiters and decision-makers with regards to what happens to their own bodies (although I am also strongly against abortion), and that therefore they should be given the option to use artificial contraceptives to prevent conception. Solemate writes from the point of view of one who is firmly linked with the Catholic Church, and therefore presents interesting and thought-provoking arguments on why natural family planning, or NFP, is a better solution to the problem than artificial contraceptives.  This is cool because we have spoken about this before, passionately and intensely. I feel very strongly about my position, and Solemate feels the same way about hers. Nevertheless, we respect each other's positions and convictions, and the fact that ultimately we come from the same starting point - the belief that every child should be wanted and provided for.   Remember: every child should be wanted, should have a chance for a future. Contraceptives aren't just about safe sex, they're about making sure that no human being is an accident.   In sum - go read Solemate's article. I do not know how I keep on making friends with the most talented people in the world, but hey, sometimes you're born lucky.  [ Edited to add:  Okay, to all those weird funky people messaging my phone - I know my number's pretty easy to guess, but gosh darn,  STOP IT ALREADY . I don't know you, I don't talk to strangers, and  no , I do not want to attend an Open Water Diver Course Orientation.  Also,  urlLink freakchild  has now gotten a Yahoo ID. Ph34r. One day, when I am trying to explain how she got her nickname, I will post a chat transcript. Just so y'all see how freaky she is and how I, her longsuffering normal sister, patiently deal with her oddness. I'm a saint, I know.]

      [For the Occident and the Orient. I'm not really sure if I really did love you, but in all honesty I tried.]   Stay,  he says. I don't answer. The brief silence is broken by other things, and the word that could have been a plea or a command gets lost in other conversations, other considerations.  I get scared now, when I hear this word. Whenever someone says this word to me, what it really means is  goodbye .  True enough, he is gone. I can never accurately predict how long it will take before he goes, but it always happens. One day I turn around and he is no longer there, and I wonder how long he has been leaving without my noticing that he is slowly moving away. How long he has not been mine. How long I have been pretending.  - - -  It's funny, how strangeness and oddity are things you learn about only after you lose your innocence. When you are younger, everything is normal. I ate fish eyeballs and duck eggs with tiny duckling fetuses embedded in them and pickled pigs' ears; years later, I can still remember the feel of them on my tongue, the way they crunched or slid against my teeth. I remember how they tasted, and sometimes when I watch people eating them, I lick my lips in memory.   Since then, though, I've learned restraint and inhibition and revulsion. A friend offers me a bite of her  dinuguan  - pig innards boiled in pig's blood - and I shudder and turn away. She laughs and redirects the spoon toward her own mouth, and I watch her eating with a twinge of envy. My tongue remembers how it tastes and yearns quietly for it, and my mind sharply slaps it down with learned revulsion. The things I could do, and say, and taste, if I had not learned that they were wrong.   There are some things I  do  regret learning.  - - -  It's ironic, but the people who tell me I am strange are the very people I used to consider strange myself.  I've never known anyone like you,  he said to me once.    The first time I met someone like  you, I retorted,  I was almost twelve years old.   We were talking about houses then, I think. I was telling him about trying to convince my mother to move to a new condo because in the one we were currently staying in, I didn't have a room. He laughed:  You talk about moving house the way people talk about buying a new cellphone.    But we honestly do need to move,  I insisted.  We've outgrown this place already, even my father says so.    You're not supposed to outgrow a house,  he told me.  You're supposed to grow with it. I've lived in the same house all my life.   I see my fascination mirrored in his face, and from the outside we must seem funny: two people absolutely amazed by this odd creature we are confronting, because they are both completely sure that  they  are the normal one. In his world, people stay put and go to reputable schools and form concentric social circles, where you know someone who knows someone who knows someone and they all hang out in the same places and you date them and break up and eventually run across them again because after all, you move in the same world. In my world, people appear and disappear and pop up unexpectedly and the circles don't overlap, so if you don't want to see someone you don't have to, you just go with another batch of friends who don't know that person and don't hang out where s/he does.   How do you not get tired or bored of the same house, the same neighborhood? Do your parents not get bored of working for the same organization for more than five years? Why are you so attached to your house, your car, your  things ? How do you know this city so well? Where do you learn the language-beneath-the-language, the meanings of acronyms, the implications of phrases, the politics of gestures and school affiliation and music preferences?   He answers me the same way I answer his questions: with bewildered eyes. What is strange to me is not strange to him, and vice versa. We do not even speak the same language, when we talk to one another.  - - -  Leaving never used to be such a big thing. In my world, everyone leaves eventually. The girl who is your best friend might move to another country in a few months; your teacher is called back to her own country for a family emergency and suddenly someone else is teaching you about early Sumerian civilizations. Besides, it wasn't always permanent. Your classmate who moved to Norway for a couple of years might come back again in the sixth grade, taller and older and bumpier. You run into schoolmates in the airport, en route to their own destinations. You come back for a visit, or they e-mail you to say they're dropping by your city and maybe you could meet up for a day or two.  It took me a year or so to learn that you were supposed to say goodbye before you left - preferably throw a party, to mark your departure.  But I'll only be gone for the summer,  I told him. He was not appeased.  In college, my friends insisted on seeing me off at the airport, when they found out that I would be leaving the next day and that I was going there alone.  You won't be able to come in,  I warned, because NAIA is the unfriendliest airport in the world.    We won't let you leave alone,  my friend told me, and I didn't ask why it was so bad because it didn't seem like the kind of thing that could be explained. In the airport, while I was reading to pass the time, he called me.    I didn't want you to leave without saying goodbye,  he said.   With each friend who insists on knowing about my departures and arrivals, leaving gets heavier. It hurts and confuses to hear the reproaches:  Can you  please  let us know next time when you're going and where you're going and when you're coming back , or  How could you have come here and not let me know you were here?   The reasons that make sense to me -  But I didn't know until the last minute that I was coming there/going away  or  There was just too little time to meet up with you, I thought I'd just contact you the next time I was around  - sound awkward and hostile when I am using them in my explanations. I hang my head, apologize, promise to send advance word of my to-and-froing, vow that I will let them know when I am in the area no matter how short my stay is.    Promise me you'll tell me when you leave,  he says, and for once there is no twinkle in his eyes.  Promise me.    All right,  I say. I still haven't figured out how to get them to make that same promise - perhaps because they don't understand that there are so many ways of leaving.  - - -   Stay,  he says again, and impatience froths up inside me.   What for?  I ask, and he opens his eyes and looks at me. I wonder what he will say, and for a minute I regret asking him that question.    For your friends? To be with your family?  he says, but his answer is more a question.  Haven't you ever thought about just settling down in one place and staying there? It's your country, after all.   ( Even her dreams smell like death to me,  says Savannah Wingo of her her mother, in Pat Conroy's  Prince of Tides .)   My friends and family will be my friends and family no matter where I go,  I say. I don't really understand where this conversation is going.  Or I do, but I don't want to understand.   He closes his eyes again, and I turn away.  I wonder when it will occur to him that I wasn't the one who left.

      Still twiddling with the SME Registration Statistics of DOOOOOM, my goodness - I've finally wrestled them all into some semblance of order, but now I'll have to analyze them, argh. I took them home last night to work on - I could have finished them yesterday, but KS and T messaged my phone and invited me to a brainstorming/chillout session with them, and I can never pass up an opportunity to chill with any of my girls. Therefore I struggled to do the calculations by hand while we threw around ideas for their office team-building thingamajig, which is going to happen in November.  Quotable quotes from yesterday's session:   T : We do not think of ourselves as merely ambassadors. We are AEP*s. [brief discussion on the various meanings and implications of the inclusion of the word 'Plenipotentiary' in the title.]  rei : You know my favorite part of that title? The 'Extraordinary' part. 'Cause, you know, all you ordinary diplomatic folk can just muck about over there ... the line for the EXTRAORDINARY and PLENIPOTENTIARY ambassadors is here, and we kick your asses all the way back to Beirut. It's like being one of the Justice League. "Don't mess with me, man, I'm Extraordinary. My title says so."   rei : If anyone asks you where we got this 'FOCUS on STARS' thing, tell them it's from that Latin phrase  ad astra .  KS : Doesn't that translate into "to the stars"?  rei : Okay, YOU think up an acronym for TO THE STARS.  KS : ... This is rapidly turning into the kind of team-building activity where no one is allowed to ask questions.   T : ... So, FTSC stands for the Fruity, Tasty, Sweet Corps!  GG : Is this a final draft of the program or do we still have veto power?  * Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. I'm not making this up.  - - -  Drat. I was going to write about exploring the Catacombs in Rome, and our guide lady who scared us into blindly following her about by prefacing the tour with a menacing warning about how others had wandered off and  never been found again .   However, I still have to analyze these dadblasted statistics, so perhaps later.

      One day I honestly  will  talk about what's going on with my links list, because I need to add people and introduce people and so far, it ain't happenin'. Argh. Sorry.  Although you need to know that  urlLink nikki  is an amazing grammar and trivia freak. Recently she  urlLink spazzed out about that stupid Tower Records ad along EDSA , making me a fangirl for life. Also, how can you not love a blog that blatantly celebrates obscure occasions such as  urlLink Father-Daughter Take A Walk Together Day ? (I took a walk with  my  dad, did  you ?)  You also need to know that  urlLink mia  has a  urlLink new place , which you should go see just for the colors. And new stuff. Yes, you really do need to check out that place on top of Ephemere, because Strange Joy is everyday-Mia, while Ephemere is pensive-Mia. All Mias are fun to be around, so gogogo.  And take a while to check out  urlLink Gabby's  blog, because it was such a lovely lovely surprise.  urlLink Nikki  has a list of referrers on her website, and I clicked on one of them, and yeah, I wish I knew how to make pretty pictures like that.   If you've been around for a while, you might want to know that  urlLink laya  is back online, although her phone is broken  again . She has some art online at  urlLink another site , so gogogo to that one too.  That's it, I'm off.  [ EDITED TO ADD :  urlLink Sandee , for several reasons. First, Gabby says she's responsible for the bootiful artwork, and second, she's Gabby's cousin. Why should you care, you say? DO NOT MAKE ME LAY THE SMACKDOWN ON YOU, BIOTCH. You should care because they are cousins and both got liberally stuffed with the 'good writing' genes. I've been surfing through Sandee's LJ for the past half-hour and trying to keep from rolling on the floor laughing because our floors are  seriously  filthy. (To everyone who has told me their taxes pay for my office and salary, let me tell you: your taxes aren't paying for my hygienic and sanitation needs, so CHILL.)   A sample of the Sandee-wit:  urlLink Harry Potter 3: Prisoner of Azkaban, Sandee-fied . She's a highschool senior, yet. I was never so witty when I was that young. I would be jealous if I weren't so entertained.  Now, back to slaving over these murderous statistics on SME registration, dagnabbit.]

      It's all about  urlLink Angelo de la Cruz  nowadays, and a small part of me is glad. It's the same part of me that ached and cried a little, when the banner headlines quoted him saying "I'm coming home", because at that point those three words sounded more like a plea than a declaration. More like an exhausted, terrified man dreaming out loud than a man who  knew  that he spoke the truth. I don't want to be bitter - really, I don't - and I want to give my government a chance, because otherwise I'll lose my sense of humor about the whole thing and that's the last thing I want to happen.   Although the thing is, you can't really trust what this government says anymore. When it's being run by a president who swore to her people that she would not run again, in order to heal political divisiveness - then turned around six months later and said that she  needed  to run, also to heal political divisiveness - then all official statements begin to sound doubtful. When it's being run by an administration whose mandate is shaky - a slim margin of victory in the just-concluded elections, among suspicions of cheating - then you aren't so sure they're acting in the people's best interest. When all recent appointments to the Cabinet and other plum positions have been seemingly politically motivated, then ... it's hard to tell anymore. Deep down inside, I think  I'm Filipino, she's Filipino, we're all Filipino. This is our country, our people. Surely they can't forget.   I don't know.   I'm grateful for de la Cruz's return. I'm glad my president fought for his return, despite widespread global disapproval. I'm glad that at least this one Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) was able to return home upright - not in a box, not in pieces, not wrapped so that the relatives don't have to see the burns or the bruises on the body, the way a loved one has become a piece of meat. You can't fault me for that, no matter what your ideological stand on the situation is.   Rumor has it that Angelo de la Cruz will be presented at Arroyo's very first State of the Nation Address (SONA), which will take place next Monday, if I'm not mistaken. Yesterday he was presented at a press conference, which I heard on the radio which is perpetually on in our office pantry. I don't think he understands what is happening, although he sounds overwhelmed and grateful for everything.  What I want to know now is, does this mean anything? We saved  one man . No one wants to talk about Sarah Balabagan, who was raped in the UAE and then beaten and jailed for defending herself against her rapist. No one wants to talk about Flor Contemplacion, who came home from Singapore in a box. No one even hears about the other OFWs, the ones who creep into our foreign embassies with heads and eyes down, as if they were ashamed they were alive - the ones who have been kicked so often and so hard that they can't remember what it was like to be treated kindly.   Why can't we just bloody do something about how cheap Filipino life has become?  We laughed about it then, but it's not funny now - my family was having dinner at a Korean restaurant a couple of days ago, and there was a television turned to the news channel behind our table. Someone, I don't remember who, was explaining that de la Cruz would be given job opportunities in the Philippines, his children would be given scholarships, that his family would be guaranteed job opportunities once they became part of the labor force. We sat there, quietly nibbling on our food, digesting that information.   (In order to understand the irony of the situation, you have to know this: we returned to the Philippines in September of 2003. All of us were jobless and my sister had been forced to quit school mid-semester. To add insult to injury, the only one of us who could get a job was my sister, who worked for a call center, a bar, and a record company in rapid succession. I got my current job through a circuitous route of personal and parental pull, which makes me bitter because I  shouldn't  have to use pull at all. My father remains still unemployed, although he receives short-term consultancy work on a regular basis.  This was all  déja vu , of course, because the exact same thing happened when we returned to the Philippines from Bangkok.)  The newscaster kept on droning, listing the various benefits and gifts that would be Angelo de la Cruz's as soon as he touched down in the Philippines. I snitched a rice roll from my sister's plate, then gestured toward the television.  See, Father?  I said.  Coming back to the Philippines is easy. All you have to do is go get kidnapped in Iraq.   Yeah, I'm bitter. It's the coffee, I swear.  [ EDITED TO ADD : Aargh, this has got to be one of the most selfish things I've ever written. Although that wasn't the original intention, honestly. The point of the thing, really, is that you have this One Exceptional Occasion, and everyone goes all out for it, and then - fizzle.  Ningas-cogon , in the local vernacular: a fire that lights up quickly and dies out just as fast. The point of it is that I'm happy for the man, but I want it to translate into something longer-lasting and substantial: protective measures for OFWs, good job opportunities and reasonable wages for the people who  are  here, a chance at a decent education for all children, et cetera.   It isn't all about my family or my situation, so if it read like that - I'm sorry. We're good, it's just - like I said, I'm bitter.]

      Oi,  urlLink WATCH IT . Of all of the comments and criticisms that have been flying around ever since Angelo De La Cruz was released from captivity, I find this the most objectionable.   Of course I'm being unfair by posting this in a blog that is (1) pink and sparkly and (2) read primarily by women. However, when your father has been told repeatedly - in front of your face, no less - that it's "a pity" he has no sons to "make him proud", or "carry on his name", or whatever misogynistic nonsense, you rapidly gain a prickly exterior with regards to your worth as a human being who is also female. (Fortunately, my father answers all such comments with a blank, confused look -  But I  am  proud of my daughters,  he says.  And they carry my name, don't they?  Hahaha. Love you, Dad.)

      Apparently, there are people in the world who believe  urlLink wives should be beaten  - albeit with a toothpick, so that's all right. The funny thing about fundamentalists of  any  religion is that they all end up flogging the same old dead horse, and yet they're all upset at each other - for using different kinds of whips, I suppose.   (There's a bit toward the end where they discuss the problem of beating a wife who is a masochist. I'm sorry, I probably shouldn't find that funny, but my goodness, DO I EVER.)  ...  I'm sorry, I'm still stuck on the mental image of someone trying to beat me with a toothpick. Here's how it goes -   Imaginary Mate : Art thou, indeed, defying me?  rei : D00d, been over this ten million katrillion times.  No , I will  not  watch Vin Diesel movies with you.  IM : Despite my countless pleas and exhortations, you remain hard of heart and head. Lo, I shall banish you from my bed.  rei : Ouchie. But hey, you  do  realize that no nookie for me means no nookie for you too, right?  IM : WHAT?!?! Right, then, moving on to the next stage of admonishment ... Before I continue, please know that this is being done for your own good and this will hurt me far far more than it hurts you.  rei : Can't hurt very much, then, because I don't feel any pain. Not to downplay your admonishment, but what exactly  are  you doing to me?  IM : Erm. Beating you?  rei : With a  toothpick ?  IM  (defensively): Well, it's supposed to be symbolic.  rei : Now I Dead From Toothpick. [Dies of laughter / Revives self five minutes later out of respect to annoyed IM] Okay, consider me  symbolically  chastened.  IM : Does that mean you'll watch Vin Diesel movies with me now?  rei : Yes. Symbolically speaking.  IM : Which means no.  rei : See, I  knew  I was doing the right thing by insisting on marrying a smart man.  I had other things to say, but I can barely type through the laughter.

      See,  urlLink this  just exemplifies what I always wanted to say to those activists back in school. There was a long story about it, about trying to follow in my father's footsteps and join rallies and be politically involved, and how I ended up disillusioned because I didn't think it would be that violent, that pointless. Violence in and of itself is pointless, and when you use it to try to highlight an issue, then you've lost even before you begin. Story aside, the point to this is that people listen better and with far more sympathy if you try to speak their language, if you approach them on their own turf and dress the way they expect you to dress - I am not advocating selling out,  per se , only translating yourself.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;It is childish to expect people to listen to you "just because" you are right; very few do. Witness the success of those who predict the coming of Armageddon on sandwich boards along the sidewalks of bustling cities. They may have valid reasons for believing the end is nigh - who knows? Yet because they walk around in sackcloth and unkempt hair, looking like they have no investment whatsoever in normal life or regular civilization, neither do normal people feel that they have any interest in what those people believe. It is childish to accuse people of "selling out" or being "bourgeois" for adapting themselves and their message to be understandable by those people they want to reach.  &nbsp;  You do not sell out if your message does not change. The message must remain the same, always. It is only the messenger, the style of language, and the medium of transmittal that changes to suit the audience. Activism has many persona, and not all of them carry picket signs or march beneath a Communist flag. I'd rather be a conformist  with  a relevant cause than a rebel without any particular cause at all.  &nbsp;  I respect Bill Cosby  so  much.  &nbsp;  - - -  &nbsp;  The tyranny of youth is that you never know whether what you want to do is the right thing - you are torn between fighting for what you dream of doing, and obeying what the older people say because they have more experience. Sometimes when I am at loggerheads with my parents over the choices I want to make vis-a-vis the choices they want me to make, I look at them and think  How do I make you understand? How do you make me understand, when we are coming from two such different places?   &nbsp;  How do I know that I am not dooming myself to failure by insisting on what I want, and how are my parents sure that they are not condemning me to live a safe sad life?  &nbsp;  I hear Yeats in my head again:  &nbsp;  " urlLink But I am old and you are young, / And I speak a barbarous tongue."

      First: if you are wondering, then yes, there  is  a way  urlLink to get dumped gracefully . Most of it dovetails neatly with my own personal philosophy, which can be summed up in six words: Bitch A Lot, Get Over It. The thing about me is that unless I am actually in a clinical depression, I  cannot  bring myself to mope overlong about anything, because past a certain point I begin to mock myself. When I am tempted to moon over a failed relationship, for example, the following imaginary conversation (or variants thereof) begins to play in my head:   rei : WOE. WOE AND ANGUISH AND DESPAIR, AND PERHAPS RENDING OF GARMENTS (particularly around the cleavage area). ALAS, ALACK, ALAKAZAM AND AZKABAN, FOR I HAVE FOUND THAT YOU DO NOT LOVE ME. WHY DO YOU NOT LOVE ME? WHY? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY?  Boy of the Moment : Er ... I'm sorry?  rei : O SPEAK KIND WORDS TO ME, COMFORT MY BRUISED SPIRIT, POUR CALMING OIL ON THE TROUBLED WATERS OF MY UNREQUITED PASSION. Also, please answer the question - kindly note that I asked you WHY, DAMMIT.  BOTM : Look, I don't mean to hurt you and all, but I really don't love you (the word "anymore" can be inserted here as appropriate).   rei : AGAIN, NOT REALLY ANSWERING THE "WHY" PART OF MY QUESTION.  BOTM : Um, because you're a flake?   rei : SKIVE OFF AND DIE.  BOTM : Okay.  rei : Wait, no, don't walk off. What kind of flake, specifically? Flake as in Corn Flake? As in Tuna Flakes? As in A Unique Snow Flake? Unique is good, right? Hey, wait, I'm talking to you! Yeah, YOU! WAIT I NEED TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND ...   BOTM : (is gone)  rei : Oh, buggre alle thif for a larke.   (Apologies and grateful nods to Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett for that last line.)  Second ... okay, dammit, I forgot what the second thing was again.   Third, I HAVE MY CAR. It is a girl - her name is Chelsea, aka Chazzy Chaz the Star, aka Chazm, aka Chaz. Unfortunately, due to idiotic methods of processing, her documents will not be released until today, which means that I couldn't take her to work with me as I planned. (This boggles my mind, actually. My mom was driving her all over QC yesterday and I was like "Um, if she's not legal yet, how can you be driving her?" and my mother - ever the hippie - answered, "Well, no one's arresting me.") I  will  be taking her to work tomorrow, though, because she's my car and I have to imprint myself on her, dammit.  Fourth, I am seriously thinking of reworking some old articles of mine and sending them in to newspapers or magazines and hopefully making some money off them. My first article is already in the process of editing and revision; however, in order to make good money off of this, I have to have a steady stream of articles making the rounds. (Moliére, you bastard, you were so right about doing it for the money.) Since I don't have enough time or self-discipline to sit myself down and actually work out a list of topics to write on, I was thinking of semi-cheating and just reworking stuff I've already written on this blog. If anyone has suggestions or comments, I'm open. (Oh, and  special note : NO, jps, I don't think an article on my sex life would interest the general public.)  I still can't remember what the second thing was.  [ EDIT : I remember what the second thing is, o frabjous day! (Sorry, Carroll Lewis.) The second thing is this - yes, I've changed my userpic. JP didn't like the first one, I didn't like the one he picked out, and at any rate the ones we were using didn't seem to jive with my blog. Unfortunately, since I am neither photogenic nor a camwhore, I do not have many recent pictures of myself - case in point: the pictures I am using right now are not even from my own camera.   Therefore in a fit of pique, I selected a picture wherein I was not even facing the camera, and found that, oddly enough, it was stunningly appropriate. Admire the sleek lines of my nape and back, and know that the title of my userpic is "Talk to the back, bitch."   When I find a picture of my face that has as much attitude as a picture of my back, then it will go online. Until then, this is as good as it gets.]

      At the risk of being labelled obsessive-compulsive (Yaz, love, I can't help it, honestly):   What fool of an editor approved  urlLink this article ? There are at  least  five grammar mistakes and confusingly vague use of certain words in an article that can't be above five hundred words. In fact, how could an article have been so shoddily written at all? You expect this standard of writing from high school students, from people venting in their blogs or e-mail, from a hastily-written first draft.  You expect so much more from a published article.  Where does the line form for frustrated copy editors? There should be a support group for people like me who have to read articles like this and  know  we could have made it look so much better and yet are repeatedly refused entry into the print industry.   [ Edited to add : Also, I have uploaded my EXTREMELY GAY userpic - so named because I could not leave Yaz's neat work alone and had to do stuff to it in Corel PhotoPaint. Namely, blurring it (because closeups of me smiling are always vaguely terrifying) and adding sparkles because -  sparkles , dammit. Hence, the gayness - where gay means 'happy' as it used to in the days of yore and nothing even remotely close to homophobia, so don't even.  The original picture was taken with R's camera during the teambuilding trip to Tagaytay. Yaz kindly cropped out everybody else so that the only person I ever incriminate in my wild and wacky word-wanderings is me. Kisses and hard lemonade for you, babe.]

      Sleep-deprived - not the ideal way to start off a week, but on the other hand, there are events and people worth staying up late for. Yesterday we spent the whole day with friends from Bangkok - it was the first time we'd seen them since we'd left all those years ago. Time rolled back and compressed, and it was as if the twelve years in between had never happened. Our mothers congregated around the kitchen and the dining table, as they'd used to, and we hung around long enough to eat before taking off to AL's room to catch up.  There were five of us - AD and AL, brothers; KD and his little brother L, who had been a baby when we last saw him and is now 11; and  urlLink freakchild  and me. We finally found out how old AD  really  was - he had always been everybody's big brother, and in the blindly adoring way of children, we'd always thought he was eons older. Apparently he's only three years older than I am, and I was stunned.  Wow,  I marvelled as he grinned and our mothers laughed.  We always thought you were like ten years older and six feet tall, you know?  All those years later he was still the consummate big brother, alternately comforting and wise; sitting at the head of the table, he chatted with our moms about the various adjustment problems we'd all gone through while the rest of us snuck off to AL's room with a glass of wine to do our own bitching.   I feel so safe when I'm with them, like I'm eight years old again and squabbling with the boys and AD is patrolling the area protectively, yelling at us for the millionth time not to run by the pool. Sometimes in Manila I am struck by moments of panic or terror, when I feel like I'm stranded in the middle of a stormy ocean and I have no lifevest and I don't know how to swim and I don't know where to go or how to get out of there. With these people, though, and a few of my friends, it's as if I've got a killer lifevest on and a strong cord that tethers me to safety, and I feel perfectly free to leap out even in the middle of a typhoon.   Of course,  urlLink G  would probably say that normal people wouldn't leap out in the middle of a typhoon even if they were CHAINED to a secure place, and she may have a point.   - - -  I'm getting the car after all, despite all my wibbling. My mom will pick it up Wednesday afternoon and I'll bring it in to work on Thursday, just because. Sparkly red car and a wild happy rei driving it around!   Ph34r m3, f00lz.  Speaking of wild happy rei, solemate messaged my phone yesterday to let me know that there's a tentative date set for her wedding - January 2006 - and that I'M GOING TO BE HER MAID OF HONOR!!!  No, of  course  it's not going to be a normal wedding. With solemate as the bride and her sister as the organizer and me as the maid of honor and M and V as bridesmaids ... this is going to be  fun .

      No more politiposts for now - I'm tired and my head hurts and my eyes hurt and there's still coffee and/or beer with my girls later and an e-mail for G sometime ... er, tomorrow morning? My internet connection's not working properly and I haven't finished this thing that was supposed to be done today, and I have a desk-full of articles that need to be sorted through and read and none of it  is . My shoes are battered and I haven't shaved my legs today (it doesn't show, but I can  feel  the difference) and my hair is being porcupiny and weird and I think I'm gaining weight again and I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing.  I want to live someone else's glamorous life for a day.  In other news, the house is getting renovated. Actually, it's been in the process of renovation for a few months now, it's just that I've been lazy about blogging about it. About a quarter of the house is now done, sort of - by which I mean the kitchen(s) are complete, the new balcony is half-done, my dad's office is ready for occupation, and the hallway leading to the living room is pretty much finished, too. As for the rest -   a few days ago my sister  urlLink freakchild  said  Oh, they just knocked down half of our house.  I was tired and braindead after a long day at work, so all I said was  Oh.  (Yes, I am indeed a  scintillating  conversationalist, you should all envy the man who gets to marry me.)   No,  she insisted - freakchild is not the type to be put off by less-than-enthusiastic responses - and pulled me to the front door so I could see for myself.  You must  see. So she opened the door and at first the porch looked the same, so I gave her a Look. She looked back, impatiently, and rolled her eyes.  Look  upwards, she ordered.   I honestly don't know what you're going on about,  I muttered, annoyed.  Nothing's - WHOA.  Because at that very moment I'd turned my eyes upward, and where I'd expected to see our rather worn roof, instead there was nothing. Absolutely nothing. My eyes slid up up up, my gaze scrolling helplessly across a seemingly infinite night sky.   Wow,  I murmured.    Isn't it cool?  she asked, gazing upward with me.   Standing there in the middle of the wreckage of our house, staring at a sky that went on forever, I had to agree. My house is in semi-ruins and commuting is still tiring and scary and Luis just wrote me a letter about trying to sell my stories to a few magazines and I haven't gone dancing in MONTHS.  But there are still stars in the sky on a clear night, and yesterday I saw the clouds turn a pearlescent pink as the sun started setting, and freakchild still knows that a clear night sky in the midst of ruins is a cool thing.   So yeah. It's cool. I'm cool.  It's weird, how my most peaceful moments are mostly shoehorned into the middle of very chaotic periods.  Via negativa , I suppose. When have I ever appreciated anything I've gotten the easy way?

       urlLink You GO, Lola Dinky.    Now that she is officially out, I suppose I can say it: Corazon "Dinky" Soliman, former secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development, is a relative of mine by marriage. That is, her husband is my grandmother's cousin - pretty distant by Western standards, but close enough here in the Philippines.   [ Note : I claim no close relation to the former Secretary Soliman - I may have met her at a family reunion or two before, but I was too young to remember. It is her husband who my sister and I remember fondly - he stayed at our place in Bangkok years back, and was great fun as a playmate. We teased him with the honorific "Lolo" (an affectionate way of saying "Grandfather" in Tagalog, most likely a shortened form of the Spanish  abuelo ), from which he recoiled  with horror. Technically - according to the family hierarchy, which the Diaz family matriarchs implement strictly at reunions - that  is  his title. However, in practical terms he's younger than my parents, so when we're just chilling, he's "Uncle".]  If I were related to her by blood, I'd think that an aversion to Noli de Castro was genetic. As I'm not, I'll assume that it's a matter of like minds. No matter how you slice the banana, though, she's pretty cool - from her blue-streaked hair and impassioned pleas for parents to stop making their kids perform sexually suggestive dances (what  is  up with that, anyway?), to this snarky dismissal of de Castro, who I personally think is a nitwit. According to  urlLink one account , she told media that she was stepping down from her position only because public service was "bigger than [her] ego". Hah! Straight to the gut.  I await her Tuesday presscon with bated breath.

      Step right up for a game of  urlLink Rock, Paper, Saddam . Hilarious. Nicked from  urlLink Guav , who really should be on my links list.   Also:  urlLink When the going gets tough, the tough get Pinoys  - scroll down to read the story of a Filipina who got stranded in the middle of a desert at the height of the Gulf War. The sun was high, she was alone, no one knew or could tell her where the UN refugee centers were, and she had two suitcases. By golly, not only did she make it back, she had gifts for everyone, to boot.   Beat  that , if you can.

      Woman,  urlLink  enough  already . There are quite a few reasons why I cannot connect the words "hope" and "President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo", but my brain completely freezes up and threatens to shatter into icy fragments when I consider the thought of Arroyo governing the Philippines over and over and  bloody  over again in various guises.  urlLink This article , particularly Miriam Santiago's  urlLink veiled references to a possibly "more authoritarian" style of rule in the future , does not reassure me in the least.  If all goes according to plan, I will be able to give myself a break from reading any and all national newspapers by December. Yay for being politically aware and updated, but sometimes ignorance honestly  is  bliss.  - - -  Oh and hey, not to blow my own horn or anything, but I had no clue that the  urlLink restructuring of the National Steel Corporation  was such a big deal. When I was working back in KL, any and all paperwork related to this case went straight to me. Looking back, a lot of my work-related griping was about this case, because it was SO BLOODY FRUSTRATING. Hush-hush deals and the like are only exotic and exciting if you're on the other side of the fence. If you're in the know, it's just another paper to push, another round of calls to make, another bunch of people who will get ticked off by your pestering.  I still don't know what I'm doing working in the government, so don't anybody ask.  - - -  And yeah,  urlLink I'm not the only one  who's not impressed with GMA. Ten-point agenda, my prettily-shod foot.

      You know how it is when you're busy with your life. Appointments, paperwork, phone calls, text messages, e-mails; work and family and friends colliding, intertwining, struggling for priority. Being several persona in the span of a few minutes, a stream of consciousness that shifts in and out of multiple thought processes. In this whirlwind, you exist solely in the present and perhaps a week or so in the future, but that is all. There is little time for anything else.   Then you hear a song that stops you dead in your tracks and pulls you back somewhere into your past, and you have no choice but to follow.  Today's song was  urlLink America , by Simon and Garfunkel. I was three when we moved to Bangkok - old enough to remember the Philippines. (I was going to say -  young enough to not be traumatized by the move , but it occurred to me that there is a gaping hole in my memories where that move should have been. My mother tells me that when we first moved there, we lived in a hotel for a while before moving to an apartment, but I have no recollection of that, or of our last few weeks in Manila, or of the plane ride to Bangkok. Which is strange, because I have vague memories of visiting Hong Kong when I was a year old. Oh, well - one day, I suppose, I'll ask her what happened.) We lived in a small flat, in a compound along Soi Rambutree - my father picked the place for its proximity to  urlLink his office  (this is the first time I've seen a map of the place since I left, and all the names sound vaguely familiar still).   I have fond memories of that apartment, although it was easily one of the smallest and plainest places we've ever lived in. It was the second storey of a duplex townhouse, designed so that one apartment occupied the entire first floor and the other occupied the entire second floor; you got to our place by climbing up a narrow, shadowy flight of stairs. The apartment was completely unfurnished when we got it, and remained, for the most part, unfurnished - my mother disliked it intensely, and refused to buy furniture in the hopes that it would motivate my father to look for a better place. In the meantime, we rattled around an apartment that had two tables, two chairs, a few shelves, and a closet. Note that I omitted mentioning beds - we didn't have any. My mother bought cheap mattresses, which we laid on the floor in the bedroom and slept on. In the mornings, my sister and I would sprawl around the living area in our underwear and read and draw while my mother did the chores.  Years later, my mother told me how lonely and frustrated she had been, those first few months. She was in her early thirties at the time, living in a small apartment with a husband who was never there and children too young to talk to her, in a country whose language she did not speak, far away from family and friends. There was no e-mail in those days, and our apartment had no telephone. It was a moot point in any case, since at that time she didn't have any friends in Bangkok, so there would have been no one to call.  In order to understand how truly mind-numbing that must have been, you have to know a little about my mother's history. She had been a sixth-placer in the national board exams for nursing; even before she graduated, private companies were sending her lucrative offers to come and work for them. She chose, instead, to go and work for the  urlLink Philippine General Hospital  so she could pay off her scholarship. After having worked off her scholarship, she applied for work as a nurse in the US and was accepted. She was 22 when she left for the US, young and pretty and fun-loving. We have pictures of her roaming across the US, and countless anecdotes from her travels there - watching Old Faithful in Yellowstone, eating lobster in Maine, picking oranges in Florida, hooting at boys as she drove past them in California, sleeping over at an aunt's place in Whidbey Island. Four years later my father proposed to her, and two years after that she came home for good, to marry him.   Imagining myself in that situation, all these years later, I asked her  How did you not go crazy?    I don't know,  she said, looking back at her younger self with amazement.  I really don't know.   The mornings were the emptiest times of the day. In the afternoons she would run errands or take us to school; in the evenings my father would come home. In the mornings, though, there was nothing much to do, and it was then that she would flip through her collection of cassettes and play us music. My mother used to love music; a few weeks ago my sister and I came across a stack of old vinyl records, which she had collected when she lived in Ohio. By the time we got to Bangkok the music medium of the day was the cassette tape. She wasn't able to bring much, but the tapes she brought define the soundtrack of my childhood: the ubiquitous  We Are the World , various albums of The Carpenters, the soundtrack of  Flashdance , Olivia Newton-John, Chopin, Mozart, some Sandi Patti, and Simon and Garfunkel.  My sister and I learned that we could tell our mother's moods by the music she played. Olivia Newton-John and  Flashdance , of course, were dance music; my mother used to be a dancer when she was younger and up until we were in grade school, she would put on music and dance to stay fit.  We Are the World , The Carpenters, and Simon and Garfunkel's cheerier songs were chore songs, which she played when she was trying to feel good about doing something she hated. When she was upset or irritated, it was classical or gospel music - Chopin when she was particularly frustrated.   When she was lonely, or when she missed home, it was Simon and Garfunkel. She would sort through photographs while  Sound of Silence  played in the background, write letters home to  Bridge over Troubled Waters , absently arrange and rearrange her belongings as Paul Simon crooned  America . Even more than the classical-music-times, we learned that these were the times when Mommy didn't really want to read stories or answer questions or blow bubbles off the balcony.   Today I heard the words  I'm empty and aching and I don't know why , and it took me back there - to that first year in Bangkok, and the longing look in my mother's eyes, and the way my father would sit on the balcony with his shoulders slumped, smoking. I remember playing with my sister, who didn't know how to talk yet; going to school and not saying a word, because - funnily enough - I didn't know how to speak English; poking tentatively at the noodles my mother had just bought in the street because she didn't know how to cook and that was the only thing being sold in our area and if we didn't buy it then we wouldn't have dinner. I remember afternoons on our balcony, watching my father's hands as he pulled the thick skin off a pomelo, and thinking that he must be the strongest man in the world. I remember clutching to my mother's dress as the little girl who lived next to us called out to me in Thai, asking something, and how horribly embarrassed I was because I didn't know what she was saying.  Say  pai tiaw, kha ,  my mother prompted softly.  She's asking you where you're going.  [ Note :  Pai tiaw  means, roughly, that you're going out; it's what you say when you know you're going somewhere, but you haven't really decided where you're going to go yet. Kind of like saying  Kami lepak  in Bahasa, or  labas lang kami  in Filipino.]  I remember, I remember, I remember. There will never be enough words for a memory.

      Funny how I can be so fluent when I'm here and so incoherent in real life. How I can never say the things that I want to say properly, and they come out wrong, in tangles instead of straight clean lines.  How can I write so well and talk so badly?  Sometimes when I'm saying things I feel like I'm piling heavy rocks on top of a crumbling foundation, and everything inside me holds still waiting for it to fall. Why can't I just say things, the way everybody else does? Why do I always end up clutching frantically at fraying ends, trying to pull them together so that they hold   why why why.  Times like this I miss W, because he always made me feel as if he saw me clear through, no matter how mud-spattered and streaked I felt. Like I was translucent in his eyes, no matter how jumbled I was.   I'm so, so,  so  very tired, and I don't want to go home today.

      I think I might be sick. Not very very sick, but at least hovering miserably on the border, which is bad enough when your workplace is FORTY KILOMETERS AWAY from your house and you haven't brought a car. (Okay, even if you  did  bring a car. Because seriously, Makati traffic.)  I also do not think I will be able to take tomorrow off, because J - the workmate who I partner with for a couple of projects inside the office - is out sick, too, and she may not come in tomorrow either in which case I will have to be here. Wow, life sucks, what a revelation.  I also think I've gained weight again. I am 130 pounds - this is what I saw on the scale in the split second I actually stepped on it - and that does not bode well, because this coming Sunday I am getting fitted for my bridesmaid dress for my cousin's wedding. That gives me - let's see - four days to lose at least ten pounds.   I am also thinking in a very panicked manner of the various projects on my desk that I have to complete NOW NOW NOW and yet my brain is not cooperating. What would be the most professional way of dealing with this predicament?  I think this will be the best week ever. (If you didn't hear the sarcasm there, YOU ARE DEAF.)   Woe .
