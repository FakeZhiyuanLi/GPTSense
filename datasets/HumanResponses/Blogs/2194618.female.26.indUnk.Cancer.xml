       "i can't see them coming down my eyes/so i gotta make this song cry."--jay-z.      hello, it is me again (you expected someone else?). after a night getting home way too late from work and staying up way too late reading, um, "whatever you say i am: the life and times of eminem," i am awake. and the word of the day is   pensive.   for several reasons. the first being that i have had a long and one-sided dialogue with eminem and this book is making me...well, not rethink my stance about him; i think he's incredibly talented AND hateful AND mysogynist and no one, maybe not even himself, knows what is real and what is facade as far as his music goes.       hip-hop is both a reflection of society, ego, and id and a massive, fascinating game of fantasy on epic scales, said the white girl. i feel like both a bandwagonneer and a failed feminist--you know, when the marshall mathers ep was released the national organization for women  put out mad press releases decrying his stance, and called for boycotts and shit, but then he turns around and says "i'm just playing ladies, you know i love you." and jimmy carter-- jimmy carter!  came out and said that he likes eminem! so is he tired? is it safe for me to like him? i have no idea. i just do. it seems to me--and this is a great oversimplification--that he's saying things that are common threads in hip-hop and were in the first place, but becuse he is popular and because he is white, people hold him to a different standard and come to the conclusion that he shouldn't talk about what every other rapper talks about. but i mean, he says "threece." that's some funny shit.      i could go on about all the other rappers that i like too and try and save my cred and prove that the white girl likes black rappers--i could namedrop the digable planets, de la, tribe called quest, jay-z, atmosphere (oops, he's white too), public enemy--i could tell you about the looks that i got when purchasing "fear of a black planet" but i don't think need to prove myself. that is the problem with music fans--or at least the little insulated east-side-of-milwaukee-same-guy-with-glasses-at-every-show world that i both inhabit and study. i don't CARE about your cred, i don't CARE if you saw sonic youth in 1995 or were the first person on your block to buy nwa or have the rare french import that features catherine deneuve freestyling with rakim. it's beside the point. shut up and move ya ass.      on a whole different topic:      and for those of you who dislike confessional journal entries especially on the internet stop reading here:      the other reason for the pensiveness is that i found out through a late-night conversation with my sister that my father took a bottle of beer with him in the car several weeks ago. there is something about this forum that makes me feel safe in confessing this. like, he was driving my mom to the grocery store and was hiding something in his hands and my mother saw and didn't say anything, just said "take me home." she then asked him a couple days later why he did it and he said "i just wanted a beer."      so i'm thinking:      WHAT THE FUCK.      my father has toed the line of alcoholism for many years and now seems like he is dropping into full-blown downward spiral. there were many years that i was afraid to drink at all, even after turning 21, because alcoholism is usually genetic and i have this addictive, orally-fixated personality and i was scared of what it would awaken in me. but i'm not concerned about me right now. or anymore. least not for that specific reason. the way my sister put it was that he doesn't seem to realize the effects that his actions have on other people. so he never beat us, or my mom, or was verbally abusive. that doesn't mean that we aren't affected. i am scared. and because i am not there, i don't live in the same city that my parents do, i can't do anything. i don't see what goes on. i just hear about it. i am powerless and i don't know what i can do.      anyway. enough. i promised some things to you last time, captive audience, and here they be.      things i don't like:          my job          winter after the first two months of it          the fact that i smoke          the fact that i'm afraid to quit          the fact that i cannot and will not ever fully be able to accept my body         right-wing pundits who clog bookshelves with ignorant shit         ignorance in general        (most) people in general        debt        little yippy dogs        people who make fun of my vegetarianism when i try to make as little of a deal out of it as possible        posers, scenesters, etc.        competetiveness among women and the peculiar form that it takes ("i'm so fat! you're so cute!" "no  i'm  so fat, you're so cute!")        pettiness        jealousy        oversimplifications       hyperbole       (if you know me you will know why those last two are extremely fucking funny)            top six movies (of all time) (in no order):           "say anything"           "lost in translation"          "donnie darko"         "meeting people is easy"          "the royal tenenbaums"          "east of eden"        NEXT TIME: i have no idea!

      today is october 28, 2003. i had one of these things about a year ago but as i am the queen of Starting Things I Can't Finish, it kind of never went anywhere. and it seems like everyone i know has a goddamn website. and in the spirit of the bumper sticker/pin i would have if such a one existed, "my method of self-expression is far superior to yours." so here i am, world, love me.      let me clear my throat:      i am 25 years old. i went to college and it was okay. i work for an unnamed evil corporation that rhymes with "harm and globule" (okay, that's a slant rhyme) for far too little money. i probably don't realize the amount of debt that i am in even as i write this. i want to save the world when i grow up. failing that, i want to be a writer. things i like:       reading       forcing my friends and loved ones to read what i read and talking about it incessantly      my boy/significant other/lover/person who i cannot assign a sufficent, adequate pronoun to and don't feel that i should, why are you pressuring me to???      listening to/purchasing/writing about music (i are a published writer, urlLink  check it       going to shows     making mix cds      writing       making silly collage things which is the extent of my visual artistic ability and giving them to people i love     listening     talking      coffee      coffee and cigarettes     scotch      sleeping in      staying up      dancing      learning to walk on high heels     being a passenger in car trips     my mommy     my daddy     etc.       top 6 bands/albums/songs right now:      the walkmen, "everyone who pretended to like me is gone"      death cab for cutie "transatlanticism"      dismemberment plan "what do you want me to say" (the remix, from "the people's history of the dismemberment plan")       outkast, "speakerboxx/the love below"        the cars "all mixed up"       elliott smith, "everything reminds me of her."       so that is all. next time: things i don't like!        top six movies!       possibly links or some sense of coherency!

       the lovers, the dreamers and me        i'm back.      this was a more therapeutic thanksgiving than usual. the car ride home to madison (yet another ding to add to my What I Have Accomplished In My Life chart--i can't drive) was spent agonizing aloud to my father about what i should do, exactly as far as telling my family that i am on government cheddar.  (or actually, considering what i'm going to get,  government generic plastic cheese slices.) the plan was, shamefully, to lie as much as possible and pretend that everything was okay...and beyond that i wasn't sure. but it got to a point where my dad took me aside and said "the longer you keep this a secret the worse it's going to be." and so. i told.      cried. a lot.     made my brother cry.      and beyond that nothing bad happened.      i think that i overestimate what people's reactions are going to be much of the time, especially my family's. we have a long dysfunctional turbulent history, but i suspect that it is no less long, dysfunctional, or turbulent than yours. and i think that over the past two days i have had the best opportunity ever to hone my worst-case-scenario imagining skills so i just easily translate that into my imagined parental reaction.      and so.       this doesn't mean that i'm any less scared. especially by a line on my unemployment materials saying that i have a Pending Issue With My Claim and will be contacted about it. what the fuck? what is pending? there is no issue! i need help, you fucks! but people keep telling me that it's only the second day. and if i continue to imagine myself in a cloth sack offering to wash your window on wisconsin avenue i will be so terrified i will lose the ability to get up in the morning.      and so.       maybe i should start a website like that asshole chick who got her credit card debt paid off.      maybe i should become an exotic dancer.      maybe i should write a novel.     maybe i should shut the fuck up.              soundtrack: blink-182, "all of this" (seriously. robert       smith sings on it.

          i was fired yesterday. after having worked like a dog for five years for $8.50 an hour at a company that rhymes with darns & coble and pretty much arbitrarily denied a raise the last time we had performance reviews, i was told to come into the office "before i started my day" by my fucking fucktastic fuck of a manager and told to go home. i will not get into the reasons why, exactly, but she is a new manager in a long line of them and she is the most passive-aggressive non-management material manager i have ever encountered. and has had it in for me and pretty much all of the existing staff that doesn't fit the kiss-her-ass-tremble-before-her mold ever since she started there. yeah. so i'm feeling fucking great today.      two days before thanksgiving. and the first time that she openly threatened my job was a day before my birthday, which she POINTED OUT when she called me in the office.      i have no idea what happens next. i don't really think that it's even hit me yet; i tend to measure situations like this in whether or not i have cried. and i cried a little last night. but mostly i drank. did the stupid thing and spent my last feasible cash on johnnie walker black. this morning i called unemployment  and now have an application in process. i also have one more check coming and people whose couches i could crash on/shoulders i could cry on or pummel, and i have my ass that i could sell on street corners, i guess.      but goddamn.     what the fuck happens now?     soundtrack: cex, "my head"           (out.)      i am so afraid.

       i want to stop and thank you baby   because i cannot think of an intro to this, which is unlike me (being at a loss for words? she who cannot be quiet ever? evar??? jeez.) i am going to express the sentiment as non-maudlinly as possible that i hope everyone has a happy thanksgiving, wherever you find yourself, and i'll see you next time, metaphorically speaking, because of the fact that i am going home to madison and will be awol for a while.      because once again, i do not wish to run any sort of risk of my family members finding out that i cryptically refer to Very Personal Things on the Internet, where Someone Could Track me Down And Stalk And Dismember Me. and so i am going to get to the list of thankfulness. which is highly unrehearsed and in no order of importance:       1. my family      2. my (relative) independence      3. matthew      4. white wine at midnight      5. dancing      6. the journey      7. passenger seats      8. conversations that last for more than an hour      9. books and my ability to get lost in them      10. my friends      11. hope      12. wonder      13. cheesy tomato sandwiches from comet      14. good black coffee      15. love in every form that i have found it in my life      16. bad diner coffee where you have to put 5 containers of cream and half a pound of sugar in to make it palatable      17. microwave popcorn out of the bag      18. road trips      19. day trips      20. day dreams      21. the fact that when i daydream now it's mostly about things that are in my recent past rather than making up stories about someone i'm never going to be      22. swimming      23. angst      24. my body      25. my mind.    soundtrack: marvin gaye, "what's going on"                    (out.)

       my huckleberry friend    today's "you idiot!" observation lies with finally realizing that there are problems with the fact that i have no edible groceries in my house. the exceptions are: coffee, which doesn't count (although black coffee on an empty stomach is an excellent decisive/weight loss weapon in that it makes you kind of sick), a can of vegetarian baked beans, a can of tomato soup, a can of tomato RICE soup (woo) and a package of instant cheddar and garlic mashed potatoes which i can't make because i have no milk. all these foodstuffs (heh), incidentally, fall under the category of "are you kidding? it's 10:30 in the fucking morning."      i get into these moods where i cannot rest until i have had Breakfast Food For Breakfast. other times i am perfectly happy eating peanut butter sandwiches or cold leftover pizza, but my stomach has the temperament of mariah carey. whatever lola wants, lola gets. and so i am trying to decide at what point of physical hunger i am going to let myself slide into before i leave the house, even though it's 23 degrees outside. this is when i wish anorexia were actually an appealing prospect. or that i had that asian houseboy and he came bearing french toast.      grrr. argh.      this weekend was spent hearing "baby got back" and "rump shaker" back to back in two separate locations on two consecutive nights and having a good time anyway. as much as i am sick of "baby got back," every time i hear it, even though it's about 20 years old and hardly gets play anymore--or DOES IT???--i find sir mix-a-lot actually quite articulate. there was a really amusing onion interview where he described going to college campuses and being picketed by feminists and eventually getting them all on his side because it's a very female-positive song. whoever did "rump shaker" can suck my dick, though.          also components/flashes of this weekend:        wearing  the Skirt (you haven't met the Skirt? oh you must lead a sorry existence) on both out-being occassions and feeling both smug and generally dissatisfied because while the Skirt is my secret weapon, there are many more secret weapons i could introduce and, like, have a whole arsenal of them and, like, none of y'all would know what hit y'all if only i could afford them. but, oh, that's right, i can't. (santa, may i please have bling for christmas and then unravel a whole new ball of insecurities about how i am obsessed with capitalism and materialism and all the wrong things whilst there are people DYING IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES? thanks.)  and i have no patience for thrift stores even though conventional wisdom and personal experience  have it  that you can find some amazing shit if you are only patient,        realizing   that i cry at the exact same moment in "breakfast at tiffany's" every.single.time i watch it ("cat? cat?? CAAAAAAT?!?!?"), and that i am probably extremely pathetic because of this,       and  speaking of which, sphinx has not showed himself but he now has a file with the  urlLink milwaukee area domestic animal control.  also i have stopped apologizing to bishop (the cat which has now become the Good Cat by default) and coming close to tears every time he cries for his brother...oh christ,     and i'm pretty sure that's all i have to report.       next time : an Extremely Predictable List of things i'm thankful for! because i haven't done one since i was twelve and because fuck you, this is my show!     soundtrack: sleater-kinney, "little mouth"    addiction: somafm internet radio on winamp. it's like they're inside my BRAIN! except my brain actually has meow mix and swiffer commercials!

       sphinx, come home   it is 8:00 a.m. i have been crying for the past half hour. i spent the night at matthew's although we said a while ago that we were going to sleep at my house on weekdays because it's easier than him having to haul my ass across town and then go to work in the morning, for a couple reasons; first and foremost being that he has been getting parking tickets (the whole fucking city is against me) and secondarily because my bed, while big enough for me, tends to make his feet stick off the end and his back hurt. so. we were at his house last night and we woke up to one of his two cats crying, and matthew went to investigate and sphinx, the other cat, was nowhere to be found and the front door was open. and it's MY FAULT. and i am terrified that he is not going to come back and something awful is going to happen.      so i spent the whole ride home crying and apologizing generally being more dramatic than the situation called for. i have spent a good deal of this relationship terrified that i was going to fuck something up, and now i have. matt is not actually angry at me. to some degree i wish he were. mostly i am angry at myself because i have this perception of myself that i am scatterbrained and forgetful and ditzy and this is just confirming that. we have woken up a couple of times now and discovered that i left a door open, and i have been told that i need to close it, and i was making a POINT of making sure the thing was closed because i was AFRAID something like this would HAPPEN, and GODDAMNIT, i MESSED UP.  i will quote myself from earlier this morning: "how hard is it to close a fucking DOOR?"      and sphinx? he is not the smartest of cats. and while matthew bitches about his cats constantly i know they mean a great deal to him. and i may as well have stood in front of him and stabbed him in the chest.     see? again with the drama.    so sphinx--if you are actually smarter than we all realized and are in some cigar bar someplace with internet access and surfing the internet while waiting for the strippers to get out of the bathroom, please come home. we are very worried about you. and the cristal will give you an awful hangover anyway.        quote: "i'm tired of living alone, i'm hoping that it shows/all over, it's all over and so it goes."--hey mercedes, "stay six"      soundtrack: suicide machines, "i never promised you a rose garden."

       woke up on the floor, time for another one   do you ever have days where you find yourself someplace and you look up at the ceiling/your surroundings/the person in bed next to you and you have NO IDEA how you got there? that is the type of day that i have been having. i went to my local foodstuffs store (i am liking the word "foodstuffs" although it is admittedly rather awkward and think more people should use it) about a half hour ago having the vague idea that i wanted noodles in a bag. mind you, i picked up and consumed dinner on the way home from work already--an overwhelmingly large  vegetarian jimmy john's sub without tomatoes when i told them to make it without sprouts--i'm just curious, in which language does"sprouts" sound like tomatoes? but whatever-- and if i had purchased noodles and made and consumed them i would have most likely felt sick.  very sick. so i kind of floated around the aisles and my eye twiched and i felt like a twit and like i was on some sort of amnesia drug.       work is nothing to report about. i put up a new endcap. woo.  and i got verbally bitchslapped by satan-the-manager because when i asked her a question about something towards the end of the night i glanced at the computer screen that she was hunched over typing little evil satan decrees and happened to see something that made me think she was writing about me, and so i asked her point blank thinking "this is a new approach," it was not the right question to be asking/approach to be taking. i will not go into details. it is not worth it.        also there is an extremely stupid anonymous  person who has started a urlLink  fight  on crime & judy's message board. it's interesting because this type of assholishness usually never finds its way into the sunny world of indie rock. even if you are reading this and you don't know who the fuck crime & judy are, go look at it. this is the type of stupidity that deserves many verbal or cyber asswhuppings.      the last thing that i have to report is that my meeting with the department of vocational rehabilitation, the one that is going to get me a new job, has postponed my meeting. i just got the message tonight--apparently the first message got erased the night of the power outage, cause i never got it. grrrrrr.     below is the highly relevant  say anything  quote of the day. "i don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. i don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed. you know, as a career, i don't want to do that."  soundtrack: stone temple pilots, "days of the week." on repeat.

       bitch, i'm a kill you        there are so many things that i could yell about today. first and foremost, the first time in six months that i try to cook/heat my oven my smoke alarm starts going off, and there IS NO FIRE, and as i am very small (5'1 & 3/4") i cannot reach it to turn it off even when standing on a chair, and after paging my slum landlords repeatedly nothing happens. until an annoyed neighbor knocks on my door and gets a ladder and helps me shut it off.  i want an apartment where i can cook without everything falling down around my ears. and where i don't have to squeeze past the sink in the bathroom to pee. is that too much to ask?     but mostly i want to kill my manager. i made the honest mistake of thinking that i was working a closing shift today and did online things all morning and treated it like a regular day and arrange to get coffee with la angelique, yadda yadda, and upon coming back and checking my messages i am informed by the cafe manager, not even my manager, on my machine that i am a no call/no show. apparently i was supposed to be in at ten. after apologizing profusely and asking if there was any way i could come in for a closing shift the response was a flat "no."  i asked if i could add a shift later in the week. "no. we need to watch payroll this week." in my almost-five years at my fucking job i have never been treated like such shit. after pointing out that i kind of need the hours, she says "well, i kind of needed you this morning."      this woman knows that i am looking for a new job and have been for a while. she knows through supposedly civil conversations we've had that i can barely make ends meet. because of the salary that she pays me. she knows also, because she is the manager, that she has been encouraging the part-time employees to add shifts wherever possible. and suddenly i can't add a shift? that makes no sense.       so when that paycheck period rolls around i am going to basically have to ask my parents for money again. which i hate. i hate the fact that i am 25 and still don't have my shit together.      mostly i hate that i am trying to get past all this pettiness and being angered by stupid people and stupid things and shit like this happens and i feel like i can't.        soundtrack to evil ranting mood: beastie boys,  paul's boutique           (out.)

           so i am sitting in matthew's computer chair on a very boring sunday writing what will probably be a very boring post. the day is gray and uncompromising in its refusal to yield anything to do at all. when 3:40 rolls around i am excercising my right as a Token Weepy Girl to go see hugh grant bumble and bat his eyes all over the scenery in " urlLink love actually ." i maintain that i have read good reviews of it but he refuses to believe me. the store meeting yesterday was pretty awful, but not as awful as it could have been.  as matthew is back in the room now i feel that it would be rude to continue writing. therefore i will express my hope to the two people who are reading this that you have someone to curl up with too and go see movies of questionable cinematic value with.        soundtrack: silence.

       "now i'm exhausted, there's no time to sleep."--braid   grr. argh. hello. today i am preparing for my abbreviated shift at work which will still make me work until midnight and then be back at 7:00 the next morning for the Annual Holiday Fucktastic Fuckticle of a Meeting. but fear not, citizens, this will surely prepare myself and my coworkers to meet every! last! one! of your holiday shopping needs. up to and including a muppets chess set and a muppets magic 8 ball, both of which are extremely useful and necessary gifts. bork.            and to add insult to injury i have the rest of the weekend off, which happens about as many times as george w bush uses correct sentence structure in a press conference.  and i couldn't get back to sleep after i woke up this morning. saw that matthew had left his cell phone on my window sill (if you wanna call him and chastize him for his absentmindedness, the number is (414)...just kidding.) and immediately got up to inform him of this via email and just didn't look back, i guess. and i should not be this tired. but i am.  and will continue to be. unless i can force myself to sleep for another hour. which is contingent on a lot. fuck's sake.       shoutouts today go to:  pizza shuttle , for providing me with food other than dried wasabi peas and peanut butter, which is all i had in my house and which, in fact, i ate out of desperation before i called them (not all the peanut butter. just a spoonful. note to dietitians/food pyramid putter-together-people: dried wasabi peas? NOT an acceptable breakfast food. do not recommend it to the fda).       the weather , for not being freezing.       my sister , for informing me via email that my new fish oliver is actually an endangered species in the wild--it's prey in the nile for a type of pike that is not native to the nile that was introduced specifcally for human consumption purposes and is close to being extinct in its natural habitat. poor oliver. but damn, i feel like an environmentalist or something.       the onion , for subtly and quite amusingly mocking all those who have weblogs in print and making me feel like a dick. which brings to mind a new feature of this blog, the Random Out-Of-Context-Quote-From-Say-Anything of the day:      lloyd: "i feel like a dick."     diane: "you're not a dick! we shared the most intimate thing two people could possibly share!"     lloyd: "you shared it with a...dick."         matthew , for just because. he knows why. this is my world and in it i am god and i can do these things.          soundtrack: death cab for cutie, "song for kelly huckaby"        (out.)

       obscurity is not a fucking badge       tired tired tired. today was strange in that i had the rare false impression that the job i work is Real, because i worked an 8-4:30 shift today. like people with Real Jobs. fucked around after work and came home to an apartment complex devoid of electricity. burned some candles and read "the coldest winter ever" whilst hoping it would come back on. it did not. freaked out because my candles were expiring and my source of light was going to run out very soon and it was cold and it all felt very primitive. went around the block to comet and called matthew and freaked out some more; waited an hour and killed as much time with one coffee, one water, one book and three newspapers that i could, and came back and the lights were back on and my fish don't appear to be emotionally traumatized. all is copacetic.      today was a bunch of nothing balled up and surrounded by little bits of random anger eating away at the sorry organ that is my heart. even when my manager praises me at work it sounds like she's spitting gleefully on my firstborn. which she has stolen from me. whilst surrounded by bodyguards. who are actually baboons.      the only good thing that has come out of the past 48 hours is that i have discovered contrary to my previous opinion of myself that i can be sort of photogenic.    ...     and my apartment smells better already.     now i am going to sleep, very self-satisfied.       soundtrack: mclusky,  mclusky do dallas  who are responsible for the following lyrical stylings: "secret fuhrer's got your tongue and bitches got your car." "all of your friends are cunts, your mother was a ballpoint pen thief/notoriety follows you like beatings follow rain." also responsible for the following song title: "the world loves us and is our bitch."      and are therefore the best band ever.

      good morning. buenos tardes. bien sur. est-ce que vous etes mon papa?     it is really too early in the morning for me to have accomplished anything or to have coherent thoughts to write about. but that has never stopped me before. wherefore i sucked yesterday, lo, today i rule. i made myself put on pants and go outside to smoke about  a half hour after i woke up. of course it's easy to say that it's easy (????) on days like today when it is rainy but with an expected high in the mid fifties.       here are my annoyances of the day:       the fact  that my refrigerator door is so busted that i have to slam it shut minimum seven or eight times before it sticks, and i'm still too...something about it to call my landlord. afraid of getting blamed? afraid of the type of person who comes in and fixes my shit (i've seen them before, they're scary)? perhaps. i don't know.       the fact  that i work an 8-4:30 shift tomorrow with my manager, satan. let me explain: i answer to a wide and vast and multifaceted variety of people at my place of employment, ranging from the dotty-and-deaf but slightly tolerable to the gleefully passive-agressive sadistic fuckwit. and the sadist is the head store manager. and i get to open with the sadist. grrr. argh.       and now i go back to my reading material, which is    true notebooks  by mark salzman. it's pretty fascinating--a nonfiction book--this writer, salzman, who apparently was nominated for a pulitzer (for his other books) but whom i've never heard of--starts teaching a class for at-risk boys in the correctional system, most of whom are looking at life sentences for things like murder.  soundtrack: travis,  12 songs         (out.)

       a confession, a mark, a scar          i hope that the two people who may be reading this had a good weekend. i had to work both days, but it was better than it could have been. got to see matthew both days--on saturday i was so exhausted i could barely move, due to being awake for two hours after the closing shift the night before and being on the precipice of sleep several times but then getting songs by the strokes in my head.  it was one of those brain-won't-shut-the-hell-DOWN nights. i am contemplating suing the strokes for interfering with work performance. seriously. i would be trying to count backwards and feel all the various parts of my body sink into the bed and all the things you're supposed to do when you can't sleep that my mommy told me to do and suddenly it (my brain) would holler "I SAY THE RIGHT THING BUT ACT THE WRONG WAY I LIKE IT RIGHT HERE BUT I CANNOT STAY I'M WATCHING TV FORGET WHAT I'M TOLD OH I AM TOO YOUNG AND THEY ARE TOO OLD THE JOKE IS ON YOU THIS PLACE IS A ZOO YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S TRUE."  jesus fucking christ. this led to i remember saying to matthew after he picked me up the following day "i want to go to mantra" and then falling asleep practically on top of him. i am not a fun person when i am overtired. i tend to cry at random and ramble nonsensically. so that was saturday, shot to hell.        so i have a new link up, to matthew's friend eriq's webpage. eriq is lovely. we like him. (the annoying royal we.) go check it out. it is like a world unto itself and much more interesting than mine if for no other reason than he has some really good pictures & if i were to try to put up pictures here i would have to join some blogger service and pay a fee or something. and fuck that. fuck that with the dirty stick. i have no clue what that means, but it sounds awful and is therefore good.        so on to this confession:       i made a promise to both matthew and to a larger extent myself that as of today i was going to stop smoking in my house. i know that he can't stand the smell and he makes no pretense about being okay with it. my mom keeps telling me that my little sister won't stay over at my house because i smoke inside and it's smelly. (she also said that you limit the type of people who hang around you when you smoke and i could have met all these wonderful PEople and i just have no IDEA...) well, i am chainsmoking as i type this. i fail. i suck.      this does not mean that it's never going to happen. i don't have any intentions of decieving anyone--there would be very little point in just not smoking when matt is around and going "look, i did it." it's still insanely detrimental and i know it. i just am amazed by my lack of willpower and wonder what would happen if, say, i tried to quit altogether.       so this is the game plan, and the apology for the failure:      after today, sometime before i go to work, i am going to get rid of all the ashtrays i keep in the house. that was part of the reason i did it this morning, i think. it's easy to say all this when i have a cigarette burning in the ashtray. and there are those who would say you don't need to apologize to anyone, that i'm the one suffering the consequences, but i don't feel that way at all. you know those stories of two people in a relationship and the nonsmoker gets cancer from the secondhand smoke? that is my latest irrational fear.       but i need to get over myself.  i need to say i'm going to change and then just fucking DO it.        "lord, i can't change." --"freebird"      that's all i have for today.      soundtrack: modest mouse, "talking shit about a pretty sunset."         (out)

      today feels like deja vu. i was woken up by a phone call at about the same time i was yesterday morning only this time i picked up the phone mid-message-being-left only to tell my friend nicole that i cannot go see maritime with owen and william elliott whitmore at the cactus club tonight because i am working at my thankless goddamn job until midnight. maritime, o music geeks, was called in english two weeks ago, which is a new anagram of what was formerly the promise ring. trivia! yay!      saw "matrix revolutions" two nights ago and my head is still to the best of my knowledge scattered in little bits upon the cineplex floor. in my insomnia last night i hunted around for reviews on the internet and i officially have a thing to add of the list of things i hate:      how as soon as i read a negative review of something that i like i instantly feel bad for liking it and for some reason am not secure in my own opinion and feel less smart for liking something that the  urlLink bbc hated .      and granted, there were questions that rose, and some things in the film were a little heavy-handed (the everything's-happy-now-rainbow-in-the-sky crap at the very end, why the hell neo was flying in the matrix during the climactic smith battle scene, some of the dialogue made me want to smack all involved...) but it absolutely made me feel like a different person. but somebody tell me why it's acceptable to go into a film with such a critical eye that all you are doing is bitching about how it lifted things from every film that ever existed, including itself? please. i suppose that is what critics are there for, but if they couldn't find anything to enjoy AT ALL it reeks of being critical because i guess it's trendy to hate on it. also according to the bbc think tank it's dumb and american. and i take sooooo much offense to that i don't know where to begin.      i think it was a beautiful film. and it made me want to learn about things i have very little knowledge about. i want to become a buddhist scholar, and a computer hacker, AND wear vinyl, AND kick your ass.       soundtrack: my chemical romance, "honey, this mirror isn't big enough," the used, "alone this holiday" (which inexplicably makes me cry).     quote: "for beauty is nothing/but the beginning of terror, which we can barely endure,/and we stand in awe of it as it coolly disdains/to destroy us./every angel is terrifying." --rainer maria rilke, "the first elegy."

      ladies & gentlemen, it's POETRY DAY!  as promised!     all poems are written by me and are at least 5 months old except the fourth one, which is by nancy ellis, who wrote it about/for me in november of 2002 when i was going through an extremely dark period. thus fitting nicely into the self-loving/aggrandizing part of this whole deal. i mean, how many of you have had poems written about you? i didn't think so.            1. "a month of thursdays"                  (for matthew)                              i wanted to write a poem about you     because the light in this room in this city at 2 a.m.     clutching phone to ear     breaks my heart.     staring out my window, trees bare-boned     & as empty & aching as i am  i am left breathing under a sky that knows me too well     to allow me to keep any of this.      i wanted to write a poem about you    because hope has grown to the size of a    tumor crushing my glass-fragile lungs, rising to overtake my throat when i breathe, i thought     you should know this.     this dance performed across wires, synapses,     electrolytes skittering across computer screens,     right click ctrl-alt-delete,     things i could never say aloud     wrapped in ironic metaphors,     defense mechanism,      weapon of choice.          i wanted to write a poem about you      cigarette ash drifting into  black coffee grown cold, habit builds off habit,      because i cannot picture you      ever waking in the same world i do,      your body is a blur of elbows,      arms folded in some defense, crooked grin for some   unseen photographer. because i want to capture that      in the back of the back of       my mind.       i wanted to write a poem about you      because      i don't know how to tell you any of this      that yours is the last voice i want to hear at night      before falling into some fitful dreamless sleep      punctuated by cries       bookmarked by fear      that i fear breathing a      word of this to you, to anyone,      that i fear that i'm crazy and wild and hurt, my head aches with the what could be and the what is       not and that which remains: i am almost terrified and i fear that i've said too          much     anyway.       2. "happy new year"       words collide      like car crashes in the air.      you wait      sensing there is something wrong       here.      you wait      with piercing eyes that can't quite see past      what you know you are.       can't quite see past      the you who stands there       half-smile mocking, teeth showing,       unphotogenic like        always,       the sunlight that you tried to harness       to keep yourself alive.       you can't see       what you have become       what is taking place, what you can't        control.       these days       have passed with nothing really to speak of       these days should have made you strong       they did you no good.       you are still so alone.      you release these words from your tenuous      aching grasp      let them fly, watch them spin, disintegrate,      and no one is here to see.        3. "dream"       exhalation of smoke       up into december stars      and the pulsing bleeding thoughts stay with me      whose numbers i still can't quite count      change me             he's pleading      only i'm not sure if i just misheard the question      the sky is gray        misleading      i want to change you,      i reply,      but i don't know how to change myself      nothing ever changes      the sky will remain twenty degrees forever      and i am trapped in this heavy human flesh      with crooked feet and awful hair (you      are obviously trying too hard)       the sky crumbles with my breath       and i'll let my eyes fill       and pretend that i don't care when you forget me.       4. "november 22, 2002"      november      a horrific month      owls feed on yearling crows      below branches      huge feathers      freeze in snow       wet patches wither       gather as ye may      there are patches of want      skirts gathered         where women freeze      anew armed      by prisoned fires       brown circled spheres      unsure      of rounding earth edges       zither anger      stringed whips      contain       like a tight      necked instrument      like ring       on swollen finger       hurt      makes it huge       displaced      out of time      entombed       without a language      pattern, a nose      in search       Do Not Move      from your mosaic      your knowing       it is centered     and moves     toward you      afraid to touch    warns and wafes                     (out.)

          so today is the one day that i have off this week until next tuesday and what happens? i wake up way too early. grr. argh. couldn't sleep until 2 last night and woke up at 8 for some godforsaken reason. grrr. argh. so spent time reading nancy friday's "my secret garden"  and reacting appropriately--but i will reveal no details as to exactly what that means, pbbbth, ask me sometime--and then getting coffee with angelique, my Token Rockstar Friend. who is not actually a token friend and who is very very dear to me, but who is, in fact, a rockstar. if my html coding skills are right (that's a sizeable if, people)  there should be a link to her band's website, crime & judy. they will rock your damn underpants off. yes, i meant to say underpants. they are both mad skilled and with the sexy.      so shoutouts go to them today, and comet the coffeehouse for providing me with coffee that did nothing at first but then hit me a half hour later as i was walking down the block, and if anyone is actually reading this in the mke area LISTEN TO 91.7 FM TOMORROW, NOVEMBER 5, BETWEEN 8 AND 10 PM, because crime & judy are doing an in studio session sometime between those hours (they're not sure yet). shoutouts also to miss angelique for promising me a tape of this session because i do not think i will be near the radio at that time.      it is a-thunderstorming outside.    also? do me a favor. just because i'm curious if anyone actually does read this. if you are indeed reading this and holding your breath for the poetry corner or can tell me anything about marxism or gnosticism (i have not the energy to ruminate on this topic now, so i lied to you--twice--but i think you will find things  urlLink here  )write me.     girlnobody@hotmail.com     today's soundtrack: "the strokes, "i can't win."

      guess who's back. i have not been vigilant about writing because through craftiness and sheer luck i was able to get three days in a row off of work, and spend them all with matthew, who is the aforementioned Boy who(m) i Love. one of which, halloween, was spent dressed like a witch/whore and reveling in the fact that i was wearing something completely seethrough, pictures of which you may or may not be able to see on matthew's website, which is linked both  urlLink here  and in the upper right hand corner. invited a bunch of my friends who had never seen me dress like that before. one of the overheard comments as told to me was "i can't believe she's wearing a THONG." which was spoken by one of my managers. at work. oh yes.      you would have to know me personally to understand the Issues that i have with the way that i look. the past four months--much of which has been inspired by matthew and my undying love and encouragement of him and vice versa--have felt like a breakthrough. an epiphany. i am 5'2" and fluctuate between 115 and 120 pounds and the only time i really talk excessively about my weight image problems is when i am close to, um, aunt flo. i think it's stupid and limiting and playing into preconcieved notions of What Females Should Look Like to bitch about your weight routinely. i am sick to death of obsessing over it. but that doesn't stop me from being hypersensitive about it. being in love makes you feel beautiful. it both helps and exacerbates, if that makes any sense at all.      so i ran around on halloween in this dress and did general party social things and went to bed and threw up the next morning because of this vile-the-second-time-around punch we had made which involved ice cream, vodka, ginger ale and dry ice and because i hadn't eaten. and the next two days were spent just being with each other. and it was lovely beyond description. and now i am back writing this and wishing that i had a remote control for time.         soundtrack for today: radio 4 "gotham!"      color for today: white, for my fingernails & toenails      flavor of the day: chocolate, for the fact that i have been eating it nonstop since yesterday both because it is around and because i am in a certain stage of my existence where i become extremely predictable and stereotypical      (nudge)(wink)(ahem)      word of the day: gnosticism, which has become pertinent because part of the time spent with matthew was watching two of the matrix films in preparation for the third (this is his thing; i am not nearly as fanboyish-or-girlish about them but am intrigued by them just the same especially because not one but two people showed up as neo at his party); we spent a great deal of time admitting that we don't know exactly what it means      NEXT TIME: a poetry corner!                         also possibly a mini dissertation on gnosticism!

       ain't no sex in my rolodex      urlLink har mar superstar  is playing at onopa tonight. if anyone who is reading this has fantasized about having the sweaty genitals of a ron jeremy lookalike dangled unabashedly in your face, this is by all means the show for you. myself, i think i'm gonna knit or something.      i am still sleepy.  matthew came back last night and i, of course, am going straight to hell because i slept in a bad with him and we kept waking up because, well, from my end he is a completely different person to sleep in a bed with from my sister. i'm quite content. in fact i am the equivalent of a cat with a well-rubbed stomach.  i am still trying to process the fact that this is the year in which the most happened to me on record, with the possible exception of the year i hit puberty.  i lost my job and fell in love. one is good in a roundabout way, the other is good in a blatant way. i kept my friends and kept my enemy list fairly short. i  don't really believe in new year's resolutions, so ha-ha, you don't get to read any. but i have stopped being sad about the fact that this year went by Extremely Fucking Quickly and intend to stop bemoaning the fact that i'm going to be thirty (uh, in five years). as my father put it: you have two alternatives, sarah: get older or die."       and i think i like my life just fine, thank you.       also i have started doing tae bo. i realize this makes me as far as exercise trends are concerned about ten years behind everyone else, but i am not trendy and i have to take what i can get, because being unemployed doesn't give me the budget to get a membership at bali's. i intend to continue some sort of daily exercise regimen at whatever lengths i have to go to, because i have realized that i don't exactly need it for my body per se, but for my mind. basically i had a breakdown over my body and confessed to my mother (not for the first time) that i hate the way i look. while this is not precisely true, there is still enough of my brain that keeps trying to fuck me up. i need it to go away. very, very much. this is the one place in my life that i  need  to start having a bloated ego. i'm not quite there. i'm not sure if i'll ever be.     to quote mr. har mar: "give it up for me. i'm the fucking best."        now i just need to fully believe that.      soundtrack: all girls' summer fun band, "dear mr & mrs troublemaker"        (out.)

       tear off your own head       i am exhausted. i don't know if it's the exercise, the strain of holidays in general, or the fact that this morning was the second time i slept in a bed with my little sister and she woke me up by crawling over me to hit the snooze button, but i am fucking tired. and i don't really know why i sat down to write other than out of habit.       so i will keep this brief. i got all the cds i had asked for for christmas (that is NOT the only reason it was a better christmas than usual), plus i burned cursive, the streets and justin timberlake (mwah ha ha ha ha ha) from aforementioned sister. it is the most musically rich christmas i have ever had. i think...just the fact that i got a chance to do things with my family rather than run away after a weekend and have everyone be all tense because i'm leaving made it better. i am also recovering from an insane amount of mexican food consumed with my family earlier today. and my fish are not dead; i had feared they would be dead after leaving them without food since tuesday. the important thing is that i am home. and reflecting on the fact that everyone made it through another year. as fucked up as we are as a family, i had an unabashed good time. and i sort of miss them now.     i'm finna go pass out now.      soundtrack: elvis costello,  when i was cruel       (out.)

       our father who art in heaven, save me from the wreck i'm about to drown in       hello.      i am still at my parents' house. i have decided that my motto for the upcoming year is going to be "...whatever." so the thing i said about i'm not going to write while i'm here? total lie. if any member of my family actually reads this, which i doubt, they can sue me for defamation of character when i am famous.       christmas was good. after we were done with all the yelling. which i am not going to go into incredible amounts of detail on because as i have said before, every family everywhere has its own version of Weird Family Xmas Tension. i got all four cds that i asked for, which is the first time that ever happened, i think, and my dad liked his present, and i got to listen to my sister freaking out because her long lost hippy boyfriend who is not actually her boyfriend came back from his hippy finding-himself journey a day sooner than expected which means she has to decide some things, and i ate more spinach dip than i ever have in my life, which is perfectly fine with me, and  quieted most but not all Fears Of Gaining Weight by becoming closely acquainted with my parents' exercise bike and think that i have convinced them to get one for my tiny apartment, but had a breakdown in front of my mother and sister about my Body Issues anyway, and i hung out with my high school friends twice, once at cafe montmartre and once at monty's blue plate diner, both of which locations bring up incredibly hard and strange memories, and my crazy artist friend offered to take "trashy beautiful" pictures of myself and matthew after seeing individual pictures of each of us...     and i am just generally having a good time, even though it all feels strange and alien and not like home anymore, and no one has killed anyone yet.     my next report will be from the safe confines of home.      soundtrack: pretty girls make graves,  the new romance .

       next year all our troubles will be miles away   hello.  urlLink clem snide  was fantastic, even though the audience was not. they played a song i don't remember hearing previously called "enrique iglesias's mole." which was actually the same subject matter as its title. i have not laughed so hard in a week. once again, if this page is not updated this week it is because i am going home to madison, land of fucking hippies--for the longest amount of time that i have been there since i lived there when i was seventeen--for christmas and i do not want my parents finding out about this. yes, i am 25 and am still concerned about my parents' opinion of me. i was trying to explain last night to one of  urlLink matthew's friends   why i hate certain elements of christmas. i feel that i didn't do enough of a good job, so in the interest of appealing to both my likes and dislikes of it, i present a list of pros and cons of christmas.         good:       1. the feeling that i get when it snows and it's close to christmas and i am outside      2. presents      2a. honestly, more so giving than recieving      3. the charlie brown christmas special      4. "have yourself a merry little christmas" as performed by bert and ernie      5. tree decorating (as of late we have always waited until the last second and listened to the soundtrack to the nutcracker. on vinyl, because we are old school.)      6. the feeling that i will always have, i suspect, when i wake up on christmas morning, like i am seven and there actually is a santa claus     7. being with my family, even if our issues have back issues     8. midnight mass, even though i am not a christian     9. bruce springsteen's version of "santa claus is coming to town"        bad:       1. christmas being advertised before halloween      2. the assholes that line shopping malls (five years of retail experience, i fucking dare you to disagree with me)      3. the pressure that i think that most people feel to make everything absolutely perfect--running around and trying to get your holly table settings to look  just exactly  right destroys the feeling of it      4. and yes it's a moot point/losing battle to argue that christmas has become too commercial and tacky and whatnot --that doesn't mean that i'm going to shut up about it.      5. but the biggest thing of all that i don't like about christmas is the fact that it makes me feel poor. there is so much that i want to get for people that i just don't have the money for.     see? see? the good list is longer than the bad.     apparently we are on orange alert.  call me jaded or a communist but not only do i not know what the fuck that  means , until our nation's leaders start being more specific about where the threats are coming from  i don't think i believe them . couldn't they just say "you're traveling, it's christmas, the world is not a safe place, be careful," rather than instill this mass hysteria?       and with that i begin to pack for the week at home.      merry holiday.      those of you who i will miss terribly this week, you know who you are.      and i will quote myself from my previous entry: "if i don't come back you know where to send the dogs. oh wait, you don't."      damn, i'm funny.      soundtrack: dismemberment plan,  ice of boston + 3       fascinating website of the day:  urlLink capturing the friedmans        (out.)

       ugly or pretty, it's still my city, make up your mind to get in or get out    well, last night taught me a very important lesson, kids: just because it's FREE doesn't mean you HAVE to drink it. my alcoholism, while not actually existing, has a new chapter of drunkenness. the mantra was fun. we danced to booty music and were the slightly-less-well-dressed-and-slightly-skankier version of dorothy parker and the algonquin round table, such was the wit that flowed. and alcohol. there was the gentleman who fell down dramatically next to our table and as he asked me to help him up i informed him that i do not talk to strangers.  HA!      there was the incident when my friend kellie asked the bartender at the back bar what exactly you can smoke out of the four hookahs that are mysteriously there. HA HA! ...you probably had to be there.  either it takes drink number three to knock my ass over, previously my self-imposed limit was two, but it was LADIES NIGHT. and i am a LADY. so. or my system cannot tolerate the combination of red bull and vodka. it got to be 1:30 in the morning and we  found ourselves at vitucci's, one of my least favorite bars ever but it was across the street. and it got voted once by the shepherd express the best pickup bar in milwaukee (grrrrrrrrreat...) so we were there and i was like "what time is it, y'all?" and i realized that i had to be up in six hours and i was Very Drunk Indeed, so i walked home (talking to myself the whole way both because i needed moral support and hoped that if i appeared crazy no one would rape and dismember me and sell the body parts into white slavery. it worked, didn't it?)      woke up this morning and felt like someone had crushed my head between their Very Large Stompy Boots.      oh, and the other lesson that i learned is that girls wearing britney spears hats make me feel murderous.      had the appointment with the dvr today and things are very much looking up. i walked home from fourth and north with a feeling of intense calm (along with my head and the exhaustion), calmer than i've felt since this whole thing started. essentially i am going to a place called the milwaukee center for independence (i am not sure if this makes me feel like i am some sort of freedom fighter bursting from the chains of my disability or not) once a week until i either find a job or decide that i want to go back to school. which could happen. as my sister put it, "what's $3,000 more in loans?"       oh, and the cat is back. he finally showed up in the live trap after we initially caught the wrong cat. i am so relieved. i can't even tell you.     and i hereby resolve Never To Talk About Cats Again In This Forum.      tonight i am going to see wee clem snide play at the bbc, another bar that i hate. but my love for the clem snide overrides that. and then it is a weekend with Boy and apologizing to the cat for losing him in the first place and then home for xmas for about a week, the longest amount of time i will have spent with my family since i moved away at seventeen. gulp. happy kwanzaa, y'all. feelings, wishes, season, etc. etc. nutsack etc.     and if i don't come back you know where to send the dogs. oh, wait, you don't.     here is the Random Say Anything Quote of the day: "YOU MUST CHILL!! YOU MUST CHILL!! I HAVE HIDDEN YOUR KEYS!! CHILL!!"  soundtrack: crooked fingers,  bring on the snakes  absolute perfectest album to listen to while walking outside in winter: see above     (out.)

       oh, es un muy grande cabeza   doop dee doo doot.    i done some writing today. first non-computer-gut-spilling writing that i've done in a while, so i'm rather proud of myself. i have been half-roped into going to Ladies Night at mantra lounge (woooooo) which is a dancey place that, despite its annoying tendency to name drinks after various chakras, is pretty okay. i say half because i am DYING to get out of the fucking HOUSE. i mean, i have been out of the house--today's excursions included spending my last five dollars on an entirely-not-worth-it breakfast at a burger king in west allis this morning. and about an hour ago i walked all the way to papa rosa's pizza to get a refund for the pizza that i decided i did not want five minutes after calling the order in. (it's not so much that i'm bipolar as i am too quick to give into my impulses and then thankfully have the ability to rein myself in. sometimes.)       but outings such as this do not count. it has been a while since i went someplace with the only intent being to make fun of other people while looking extremely skanky myself.       oh, and return of the king was pretty amazing.     and i have a new link. go look at it. apparently there is an entire Seedy Underbelly of literate-smut blogs. my favorite kind.    soundtrack: the new loud, "angelique, write a song for me" (a song written about my rockstar friend--i'm a celebrity by association! i'm a celebrity by association!)

       don't waste your time on me, you're already a voice inside my head       okay, so in the depths of my despair i didn't acknowledge the fact that my blog has a Whole New Look and is Very Pretty. woohoo for terms like skins which i didn't know anything about. (woohoo for having way, way, way too much time on my hands.) also for blogskins.com. woohoo today has been much of the same. in fact i don't ecatly know why i am so hellbent on chronicling the same thing that i go through every day if it's just me bitching. this may take a non-daily-basis turn soon, i'm not sure yet. today was spent hypothesizing about the cat's whereabouts, watching bad television and becoming obsessed with downloading the new blink-182 album in its entirety, thanks to stupid cable and stupid mtv, which featured a behind the album on them or some fucking thing. (not to mention lack of moral values, as i did not say "i  bought  the blink-182 album.)  shut up. i don't want to hear it. not that i need to justify everything to you, but the following is a list of things i am a sucker for:    1. a pretty melody    2. boys with tattoos and obviously dyed hair (matthew, do NOT get any ideas)    3.  robert smith    4. critical accolade type things that speak of band x's Growth and Change that somehow make it okay to listen to a band that has been featured on trl    4a. many times    5. geetars    6. White Boys With Angst      in fact, i would say that bout 90% of my record collection is comprised of Songs By White Boys With Angst...it's just me. i'm sure that you could make a list of things that you are a sucker for and i would roll my eyes too.    now that the self-defense mechanism (it's like tourette's with me) is over with, what else do i have to report?    i did feel better today because while hunting for this album nonsense i had myself a wee full-on geek out barefoot dance party, something that i have not done in a while. sitting around the house like a fucking convalescent gives you a certain amount of pent-up energy, i guess.  as does eating nothing but several handfuls of chips and some low fat triscuits because it is too cold to go find real food. and you are lazy. and joke too much about cultivating an eating disorder.    last night i had dinner at pieces of eight with matt and a bunch of his coworkers. as i knew none of them and they were all at least ten years older than me and i was kind of shellshocked and wanting to make a good impression, i was rather quiet. and scared. until i had three glasses of wine and two of champagne and one of his coworkers consumed a couple too many apple martinis and started conversing with the pieces of eight manager about the penis enlargement junk emails he gets. whereupon i decided that old people are funny and i was not scared anymore, but remained quiet. i guess that's a tendency that i inherited from my dad--inability to be social if i am scared. it was a good night, but i broke my vegetarianism of ten years, because oysters were served as an appetizer and they are the one food i wanted to try because i had heard they were Sexy. turns out they are not so very sexy when served with spinach, and are in fact gross and a big letdown and i broke my convictions for nothing. oysters are people too! but three glasses of wine certainly make you want to...eat everything.     tonight we are going to see   urlLink the return of the king   .  i have learned from the telly-vision that elijah wood has cried upon each of his five viewings of it, so basically there is no hope for me.      soundtrack: ben folds, "the luckiest," a song which has joined the ranks of songs that make me break down in full-on sobbing upon the first time hearing them. a group which i wish i could say was small. but no. i am  that   emotionally unstable.

       nothing's gonna change my world        hello. i am going absolutely crazy. it's nasty and disgusting out and i have spent most of the day shuttling from one side of town to the other to pick up a change of clothes and feed my stupid homicidal fish. i have not completely discussed how much not having a job is fucking with my head. i feel like i have been hiding from my life by merit of the fact that i hung out with bishop the cat at matthew's house last week when he was out of town and that matthew is pretty much the only person i see on a daily basis. which i don't mind. i hope he doesn't mind me. but the point is that i feel this complete disconnection from a life that i pretty much followed for five years. i hardly see my friends anymore. my days are spent watching television and reading and i don't have any idea where to go from here.  i feel like by merit of the fact that there is so little variation in what i do with my time i have become an incredibly boring person as a result. i want to be stimulated or challenged by something again, but i am waiting to have my third appointment with the department of voc rehab on friday and it would be stupid to go looking for a McJob in the meantime. so all i can do is wait, really. and walk. everywhere. and watch tv. and reread book for the five thousandth time. and shop for things that i can't afford. and be with matthew.     i don't know. loneliness has set in with a vehemence that i have never experienced before. my biggest fear right now is that i'm going to transfer all this neediness on to matthew because he is the obvious host, being always around and all, and that he's going to get sick of me. not just matthew. i am afraid that when i see all my friends they're going to have the same perception--that i'm grasping at threads and not making sense about the root of my discontent.  i never wanted to be this needy.      i don't want my old life back. i just want to be able to somehow get a glimpse of what the new one, what the next phase, is going to be like and know for absolute certain that everything is going to be okay.             soundtrack:  beatles,  let it be       (out.)

       fuck the formalities       spent this weekend seeing the very milky christmas vii show, an annual tradition. i wasn't sure what to expect this year (ohmigod, where's death cab?) but the show introduced me to the fact that yes, low can rock out, shattering all of my previous perceptions of them being extremely quiet lo-fi indie rock darlings. also i totally have a crush on the singer. he's married, in addition to being a rockstar so this will go nowhere.  but after the show my friend nicole and i deconstructed his appeal and came to the conclusion that he's like the college professor who  is brilliant and unattainable and scruffy and wears stripey sweaters but in a--well--hot sort of way. i was also introduced to a fine fine band called  urlLink troubled hubble . i then proceeded to get Very Very Sick Indeed and spent the rest of the weekend going through boxes of tissues like they're going out of style. then about an hour after matthew and i had the folllowing conversation:     me: "why do i feel so nauseous?"     him: "well, you  are  swallowing a lot of snot..."     me: "SICK." [or something to that effect]     ...i proceeded to empty my stomach of everything that was in it. y'all really needed to know that, didn't you? that's what i'm here for. if this is the Deadly Flu Of 2003 and i die or something i am totally blaming my mother.   i am feeling better today, thanks for asking. still kind of shaky, but i can breathe again. breathing rules.       i can't help but think that perhaps if i didn't smoke i wouldn't have the same cold/throat thing or a version thereof every winter. i did not smoke at ALL yesterday and am rather proud of myself. i would be lying if i said i was completely confident that the same thing is going to happen today, but i'm...not... un confident. feh. i am aware that quitting altogether would solve a lot of my problems. i am aware that i would make my mother the proudest mother alive. and boy probably the happiest boy alive. i just don't know. what would i do with my angst if i quit?     that is just about everything i have to report. now it is back to extreme dating (i am gorging on cable before m. gets rid of it tonight. i know, priorities, fucked, etc. quiet.)     soundtrack: silence (too weak to focus on anything musical)     (out.)

                             the way out is in       writing this in preparation for leaving for the airport, where i am going to Meet My Beloved  (he was supposed to be here at 11 this morning, dammit) and generally be a cliche and geeky and girly and enact fantasy reunion scenes and whatnot.      my house is a mess. although unemployment gives me a good deal of freetime (understatement of the week, folks) i apparently have not learned how to Use It Appropriately yet. it's not so much that my house is dirty per se, it's that i have this annoying habit of throwing a book on the floor when i'm done with it, throwing a shirt on the floor when i'm undressing (or being undressed...mmmm...) (i'm sorry, sexual frustration is kind of all-encompassing) (am i actually typing any of this? am i going to  leave   it?  yes, i am) and so on and so forth.  oh well. ain't like i'm gonna have anything to do tomorrow. or the day after. or probably the day after that.      fuck, y'all.      the only other thing worth reporting is that i Officially Have No Idea what to get either the boy in my life or my father for christmas. spent a good deal of time browsing various shops on brady street for ideas and mentally enacting dismemberment rituals upon the girls who work at starship for pricing a puma shirt at $68 that would have looked fantastic on matthew....i got nothing. if i weren't afraid that it was going to somehow come back and bite me in the ass, i would just say "i don't believe in christ anyway and the fact that i celebrate any of this is silly." but the fact is, i want to show the people i love that i love them. i have always said that i find giving things better than receiving them myself. but on my budget, i can't do ANYTHING for ANYONE.      and that is the most frustrating feeling in the world.      soundtrack: yeah yeah yeahs, "tick"      (out.)

       however far away, i will always love you       back at matthew's house. and this time the attempt is going to be openly futile because it is raining and sad and disgusting and any cat in its right mind will not be going out to do whatever cats do when they are out.  but i worry. endless conversations have been had about my worrying. this is just who i am. and if he can actually eat tonight, even if he doesn't come home, i will feel slightly better.      and now, in the interest of talking about something other than the fucking cat, i just learned from mtv (and who says cable doesn't teach you anything?) that eminem almost got in trouble with the secret service over the following couplet, from a song that was leaked to the internet: "i don't rap for dead presidents/i'd rather see the president dead." apparently this constituted a  physical threat to the president, but they have decided to drop the investigation. way to take music literally, guys. way to completely misread metaphors. of course, mr. mathers has been out of the public eye for a while, so at the very least people are going to start talking about him again. and besides. without a pistol or a posse could he really kick anyone's ass? he's tattooed and all, but he strikes me as little. maybe i just don't examine him shirtless enough. him without his shirt, i mean, not me.      the other thing i learned from the cable today is that i now have a new reaspect for ag. (to the uninformed, which may be you, buddy, ag=xtina=christina aguilera.) she of the dirrrrty, who most people i know have a love-hate relationship with, or to be more accurate, a hate-hate relationship.      also apparently my ass-poor eating habits and my tendency this week to walk 3000 miles a day has made me lose 2.5 pounds. yay for living below the poverty line!      the days are just bleeding into one another. there is a core group of people who i am keeping in touch with but that's mostly by phone or the yahoo instant messenger (tm). in my next life, i would like to be a cactus. they don't ever get lonely or randy or lose their jobs or worry about making rent or worry because they can't afford a good christmas present for their father. or anyone else, for that matter. they're..just...cacti. they just ARE. i think that would be great. you may or may not interpret this as a sign of growing complacency. i wish to make it clear that it's not. i wanted to be a cactus before i entered the wonderful world of government cheese.  it's just that when you aren't working, even if you hate your job you still have a sense of purpose. and i have lost that. i don't know what my purpose is. or rather i'm slowly beginning to have inklings of what it could be but no one can snap their fingers and make everything happen right now right this second posthaste please.     if anyone can make that happen, please tell me how.               soundtrack: kate bush, "running up that hill"  (amazing what you can find when you hunt through your boyfriend's computer--this may or may not help me forgive him for the ace of base)        (smirk)        (out.)

                          i was next in line, which meant i was invisible        writing this from once again the bowels of exhaustion (i like it here), but at matthew's house, which means, um, the exhaustion shows up on the internet faster because he has a better computer.  whilst matt is in maine for work i promised him that i would stake out the stupid fucking goddamn son of a bitch missing cat for at least one night. my weapons include the porch light, cat food, and tuna fish. so far the only things that have happened are the neighborhood stray who is not sphinx has eaten some of the tuna fish, i accidentally stabbed myself while trying to open the tuna, and bishop, matt's other, non-missing cat, won't leave me alone because i gave him some tuna so he wouldn't feel left out. possible Very Big Mistake--he throws up a lot anyway and tuna flavored/scented throw up is not going to by any means be a pleasant thing. we'll see.       i am finding it mildly strange to be in a house with no telephone. kind of uneasy. this is probably just because i was up unti 1:30 last night reading a rape memoir and when i read things like that i think everyone everywhere is out to kill me and/or rape me and sell me into white slavery for at least a day after i finish them.       i'm also just rather lonely, and the fact that i can't call anyone is not something i'm used to. matthew's house is nice and the cat is keeping me company but it isn't the same without him here. and i'm beginning to feel like a jackass because i am speaking in full paragraphs to the cat. and watching horrible, horrible programming on mtv. i used to feel less privileged because i didn't have cable...      also i applied at borders bookstore today. HA! take that, you starnes & chernobyl fucks!      (i do not intend to fully pursue employment at another bookstore.  i just want to get out of the HOUSE, is all. and it's something that i know a great deal about as far as areas of employment go, the hours are not as fucktipated, i have to look for jobs one way or another, and i can still plan the rest of my life if i get part time.)       and now i am going to go watch out the window and think like a cat.      soundtrack: white stripes,   de stijl       (out.)

              i have seven faces, thought i knew which one to wear             hello.      i am writing this from the bowels of exhaustion--yesterday after my appointment (quote from career placement lady: "have you ever considered becoming a teacher?" FUCK me) i decided, in my fear of lethargy and/or weight gain, that it would be in my best interest to walk from 76th & wisconsin to 2nd & wisconsin. which is five and a half miles, something that i didn't realize until it was pointed out to me. i also decided that it would be fabulously intelligent to do this on an empty stomach. so i did. cultivating an eating disorder is becoming more and more attractive every day--hey, it would save money!       and then, icing on the cake, rather than get coffee whilst waiting to meet matthew at his house, which was my original plan, i thought that experimenting with blatant irony (is that an oxymoron?) would be an equally fabulous idea. so i went to scotty's, a west allis bar which is owned by scotty, who is, in fact, insane, and read urlLink  "drinking: a love story"  while drinking a bloody mary made with the Most Absolut I Have Ever Seen In My Life. and trying to decide whether i was being hit on by the boys playing pool or not. and so i was feeling pretty good, if by lightheaded and woozy and/but not hungry anymore i mean good, and so i drank a beer as well. and then it was time for the eight block or so walk to matthew's, which must have gotten some strange looks from west allians, to see this tiny girl in a huge winter overcoat drunkenly swaying down greenfield and singing at the top of her lungs to death cab for cutie. at matthew's, upon informing him that i was drunk, i eventually broke down crying. after i had explained everything. which i still can't exactly explain to myself.         no matter how happy i am, there is still this little monster of sadness that lives somewhere in my body, slightly behind my lungs. i have had to fight with it more lately because of the shitty circumstances that i find myself in. but because this thing lives within me i flirt way too much with self-destructive impulses. i see it hurt the people that i love and it kills me. i would say that i just don't know what to do about it but that seems like way too much of a copout, like it's too passive. but at the same time, i really DON'T know why i pull this shit, why i'm so attracted to not eating and  chainsmoking and drinking too heavily and cutting myself with razors and scarring myself with cigarettes and basically bringing my physical state to the point where my mind is at times. there is probably a rational explanation but i would have to have years of psychology training to begin to tell myself anything other than speculation and theories. romanticizing the darkness. maybe there is no one answer.  so: at this point i have to leave it at  i don't know .       cut to about an hour ago, when my mother called me  and woke me up, and i wasn't really sleeping but  i was trying to. you would have to have five more pages of backstory for me to begin to describe what the conversation was about, but it appears that i hurt my sister very deeply while i was in town for thanksgiving and am further hurting her by giving her the (false) impression that i'm seeing her concert because i feel obligated to and am going to Run Back To Milwaukee the second it is over. and everything was resolved, she came in the door while i was on the phone with my mom and everything was worked out, but i ended up in tears. again.      i just want to get through ONE day where i don't cry over something.       i don't want to feel like i am constantly at odds with myself. i don't want to fight myself anymore.      have a good weekend, everyone.   soundtrack: preston school of industry, "get your crayons out!"

       i wasn't made for secrets like these            today was good. with the exception of the fact that i had a peanut butter sandwich and three cups of coffee all day (i am going to a friend's house for dinner--a positive thing about unemployment is you have an awful lot of freetime) and am feeling kind of dizzy. perhaps i am subconsciously trying to feel what it's like to actually go hungry or preparing for when i do.      got the almost-last paycheck--it was mailed out THREE DAYS after it arrived at darn & cobalt--i am tempted to say it's pure aggression. but whatever.  the problem is that i haven't deposited it because the ghetto-ass ghetto atm in my neighborhood is out of deposit envelopes. it's just one thing after another.     got the aforementioned three cups of coffee with my friend on an outing that turned into five hours--after coffee we ran around and looked at used vinyl and i found a copy of the lovin' spoonful's greatest hits, which i listened to when i was, like, six. my parents had a copy as a holdover from their hippie days. and i got sad because i am not six anymore.      i feel like such a vagrant. half the time i just don't know what to do with myself (de-ne-neh) other than walk a lot and watch "all my children," which makes me feel even more pathetic. tomorrow i am going to haul my bus-taking ass all the way across town to take a series of tests recommended by the dvr which will help me, apparently, figure out What I Want To Do And Would Be Successful At. which is nice and all, and we were trying to schedule it before black tuesday happened, but, you know, could you just place me at a factory or some shit and i'll figure out a Career later? papa needs a brand new bag. also my phone not to be shut off.          i don't know anymore. i feel like even my writing is getting boring. this may change soon as matthew is going to meet my parents on saturday. we are driving to madison to see my little sister's orchestra concert. and while i expect no drama in that, it will be interesting nonetheless because we will be seeing white people with dreadlocks in their natural habitat. either that or my dad will crash matthew's car.        (i'm totally nervous...)      and if anyone wants to buy me "the people's history of the dismemberment plan" for christmas or at least steal one of the posters advertising it from atomic records, i promise you my firstborn and/or will write you into my will.    because i'm rich, you know. i was just working at barnes & fucktards  because i felt guilty about my trust fund.    soundtrack: the rapture, "house of the jealous lovers."

       there's lightning in your teeth        there is a small child somewhere in this building. i can smell it. more precisely, i could  hear  it this morning when i woke up at 7:20 and it took me an hour to get back to sleep. i would like to point out that these apartments are the size of small closets and that if you stick a small child in one, with or without a parent, it is going to scream. a lot. as it did this morning. and nowhere in the parent handbook, i think, does it say that the best way to calm a screaming child is by telling it to shut up. motherfuckers!      agh.      so things are looking up, in a way. yesterday was spent with my fellow unemployment friend/style guru and setting up a concrete appointment with a woman in career counseling after playing phone tag with her for, like, three weeks. something i have noticed when i talk to Professional Adults: i use phrases like "touch base."      and friday the unemployment people are going to call for a phone interview. scary!      yesterday's tools for getting through the day included apple pie ice cream (it was only three dollars), toilet paper (i needed to buy it) and chocolate soy milk, which i bought in a bout of insanity. it does not quite taste like chocolate or milk. but it's good. i know you don't believe me.      and the only other thing that i have to add is if my last check from harm & odle doesn't come today i am going to, in fact, break some heads.         soundtrack: tv on the radio, "staring at the sun"           (out.)

       everybody will be let down        so this is Day Six officially of unemployment, but it really feels like day one. this is the first day of it that i have to spend largely on my own rather than (crying) at my parents' house or (crying) at matthew's house. i feel extremely fragile. while i can be laughing and having a really good time one minute, what miss golightly would call the "mean reds" can sneak up on me more quickly than my moods have ever shifted.      and i'm really not sure what i'm afraid of.       in other news, i am no longer an alien or a communist in the eyes of matthew's friends, for we watched the first indiana jones last night. it was pretty good. i am so relieved.  also matthew's grandfather has died of complications from alzheimer's. matt said that it was for the best as he's been very sick and not himself. he's more worried about his father at this point.      so yeah, this is a cheerful fucking entry.      *here is a list of things that are good right now:      *i have enough food to last a week, maybe more      *i have vices and money for vices (way to prioritize, jackass)         *none of my utilities have been shut off, nor will they be       *i will have just enough, i think, to pay my rent     *i have my friends and my family and my matthew     *and i am the best writer ever.            soundtrack: the strokes, "automatic stop"; box car racer, "tiny voices"          (out.)

       don't let nobody with the power to sign ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme  in an effort to steer this one-way train away from talking about myself entirely, here are some things that i've noticed lately. the tennessee public school district has banned okayplayer.com, claiming that hip hop is "militant, anti-authority...and misogynistic." great.  urlLink here  is a link to the discussion that brings that up and attempts to answer the question "what is hip hop?" admittedly they answer the question whilst plugging okayplaer artists, but it's pretty interesting anyway. and kind of enraging. the banning part, i mean. and speaking of enraging, there is a growing movement among conservatives (backlash because cbs wouldn't air the reagan miniseries?) to get  urlLink reagan's likeness on the dime.  jesus christ, does it ever end? the fact that the man is dying of alzheimer's is very sad. and yes, it's very   sad that the   left-wing media controllers refused to allow the miniseries to air. but that doesn't mean he EVER did ANYTHING worth ANYTHING AT ALL while actually in office. does that also mean that if someone makes a film about  the clinton legacy and   it    gets shut down his ass is gonna be on the dollar? i very much doubt that. here's an  urlLink editorial about it  which sums it up better than i can.    fuck. i don't know.     tonight's plans involve my sister coming up from madison and running around with her and being stupid and actually seeing (as long as they don't back out, and they very well could, as it is the coldest day milwaukee has had in five years) some of my old friends.  extended multiple human(s) contact (s?????) is such a rare and wonderful thing for me these days that i'm tempted to bust out the cristal, prada and little plastic tooter horns.. wait, this isn't the sex and the city fanblog....       and the rest of the weekend will most likely be spent debating what we should do for five hours and then not doing anything. ah, tradition....       one final thing: i am, apparently, a triolet. add that to the fact that i am 47% slut and you have one very confused (but happy at not being a sonnet or some shit) me.                              If they told you I'm mad, then they lied. I'm odd, but it isn't compulsive. I'm the  triolet , bursting with pride; If they told you I'm mad, then they lied. No, it isn't obsessive. Now hide All the spoons or I might get convulsive. If they told you I'm mad then they lied. I'm odd, but it isn't compulsive.

       love spreads her arms, waits there for the needle   hello. i have spent the better part of two days in various locations being confronted by the impending doom (doooooooooom!) that is valentine's day. the most recent was about a half hour ago at beans & barley, home of the loveliest pieces of useless junk that i have ever seen in my life. i came this close to purchasing the following, as after about ten minutes of looking at all the displays some insidious voice in the back of my head started going "get that...and that...that would be so cute...":     1 (one) coffee mug with shakespeare quotations relevant to love emblazoned on it      1 (one) bag of heart-shaped valentine's chocolates, assorted     2 (two) heart-shaped candles, pink     1 (one) wind-up monkey clashing cymbals     what the  fuck ?     i physically had all but the coffee mug in my hand and replaced each item after i snapped out of the trance. understand also that none of these items were for me. i sincerely hope that the person these were in fact intended for is not horribly, crushingly disappointed now that he knows he is getting none of these things. i go back and forth on this; 98% of me realizes that it's a useless goddamn holiday dreamed up by some boardroom executive and heart shaped things are in no way going to improve or detract from my relationship. i have even told matthew on multiple occasions that if he gets me anything heart-shaped i am going to clock him. (thus deepening the mystery of why i was ready to purchase chocolates and candles.) and dude,  ask  him how much i get him little sentimental useless objects. the other part of me is kind of swayed by the romanticism of it all and thrives on any and all excuses to wear cute underwear and go out to dinner and make googly eyes across dimly lit tables. jesus, i'm hopeless. and probably a hypocrite.        i think the crux of it is that i really don't have a problem with telling him i love him on a nationally appointed date but i want to do it on my own, without the aid of any hallmark sponsorship. i want to give him something that  means  something, goddamnit.  thus coming back to one of the overriding discussion themes: i-don't-have-any-money-to-give-him-something-wonderful-because-i-am-fucking-unemployed.      and for my part the one thing that i really want in the world right now is  urlLink rufus wainwright  tickets, which are much more expensive than any show i've seen in like the past year ($30 for the most expensive ones; which i guess for gainfully employed people is fine, he is very much not cher). i refuse to ask anyone for help because i have this thing about making matthew go to see concerts that are "my music" unless crime and judy is playing. and even then sometimes. i am already partially breaking this rule on v-day itself. but crime and judy is opening, so it actually counts. and no one else i know has that kind of money. so aside from selling my ass on north avenue or performing fellatio on a security guard (and there are certain people in my life who wouldn't be pleased with that) or, you know,  sensibly budgeting and going by myself , i am stuck.       donations to the cause may be sent to the following p.o. box:       just kidding.      so to sum up, i will quote andre 3000, who said it very succinctly indeed: "fuck that fuck that valentine, fuck that fuck that valentine, fuck that valentine's day."      but there will probably be more ranting on the subject as it gets nearer. apologies in advance.        soundtrack: the stone roses,  second coming         (out.)

       you little wonder; little wonder you   hello--the only thing that i actually have to report today is the fact that i have updated my links--deleted a rather useless one and added a link to (in my non-web-proficient opinion) the Best Online Game Ever, the emo game. even if you are not familiar with or are driven to violence by the term, surely you too want to save the get up kids from being sodomized and anally raped by steven tyler. (or if you are playing the mini-game you can save the alkaline trio from hell and skeletor. i'm not sure what the fuck you're fighting against in the official sequel but it involves fighting the american idol finalists; could anyone possibly not want to do this?)  and if you  are  familiar with the genre, you will laugh really, really hard at things like the fact that atom from atom and his package's superpower is the metric system. and there are downloads! have i made my case enough yet?  go. play. it's fucking great.       soundtrack: david bowie,  earthling            (out.)

       show me a word that rhymes with pavement and i will kill your parents and roast them on a spit   "i've been like this since i could talk. before that i just pointed and laughed."--darlene from  roseanne       this is the first friday night that i have been alone in a long time. not that i mind this at all. i am tired and my ass hurts--made myself go through an exercise tape even though by the time i got home i was smack in the throes of this wave of exhaustion that was more akin to a typhoon. but the fact that my ass hurts actually makes me very, very happy. for lo, it signifies progress. like in the days of expansion towards the west. and the chinese. with the railroads. yeah. also i did some more culinary experimenting--this time it involved much tamer ingredients, but adding canned tomatoes to a lipton pasta side thing (sour cream and onion, while an excellent flavor for potato chips, turns out not so much with pasta) is...not exactly a revelation, but palatable. plus i feel like a ghetto nigella lawson, with less voluminous hair. feel me?         why am i alone and not out shaking it like a polaroid picture with my unemployed rockstar ass? several reasons:      1. the aforementioned sleepy      2. there is a fresh three inches of snow on the ground that i do not feel like picking my way through, not tonight      3. ain't nobody calling me, ain't feeling no love, so none of y'all gets love      4. the friend who i  was  supposed to go drink aimlessly with has canceled and rescheduled on me, so i am instead going to see this  urlLink seam and crime & judy show  with her tomorrow night. she promised. it's a date. whee.      note to self: mention to angelique that i should get promotional royalties, and/or become hired if and when crime & judy become Huge.      this also means that i will be deprived of matthew for two days. well, with the exception of dinner tomorrow night, but after that the demands of my social calendar do not permit me to stay. sigh.      pop culture note: they are promoting some upcoming show on nbc called "las vegas" that i could have sworn had been canceled already with "the biggest stars," who are as follows: all in the same episode:        jon lovitz (snort) (giggle)         jean claude van damme (crickets)       and miss paris hilton.      this is what i have to say about the last one: star? star? excuse me? you get a skinny blonde chick to be petulant for one season on a goddamn reality show and release a tape of her fucking someone (which is boring, frankly--if you are honestly enjoying sex and are therefore sexy you do not adjust your angle/profile in front of the camera every thirty seconds) and this makes her EMBRACED BY MIDDLE AMERICA?      jeez, money and cheekbones really do buy everything.      and now i am going to go suffer through the cold sweats of matthew withdrawl syndrome. enjoy your weekends.      soundtrack: the fire theft, "chain"     (out.)

       i've been here before a few times, and i'm quite aware we're dying   hello-- i am writing this from the boy's house; as i am sure you are all aware the windchill is like negative five thousand and therefore i'm kind of stuck. the bus ride back to my side of the world is about an hour long and involves a transfer, so i have opted to stay the fuck here, thankyou very much indeed. this weather makes me thank (insert deity here) that i have a home and that i am inside. but it also makes me think about what it must be like to be homeless on a day like today. i wish that i were in a position to go out and help someone or give money to a shelter or something, but the truth is that i have enough problems of my own. god, that sounds like such a selfish copout.      am still in the grips of a quasi-depression that is heavily influenced by this lack of job and subsequent feeling of a lack of direction. i have also discovered a talent of mine to make tiny problems and tiny fuckups--like leaving the sugar on the counter--Huge And Life Altering. this scares me. i am probably not the only one who is scared by this, either. the bottom line is that i need human contact. and the fact that i'm not getting enough anymore (from more than one person--i don't fault the person that i do get it from at all, he has been wonderful through all of this) is altering my brain's chemistry in ways that i can't even fathom right now. on the one hand i really enjoy solitude, and i do well enough filling up my days. but i want so much to be doing something that i'm good at and that i like doing, other than making my way through every single book on the shelf of the milwaukee public library and watching crap television (saying it's because i need to know my enemy but really because i am fascinated by it) and bitching about the same problems over coffee. i need to feel like i am worth something. and this is true in the sense that i have the people in my life who i love and feel completely fulfilled by them and am still keeping active, both physically and in the sense that i occasionally do things outside my comfort zone (see the skiing entry).     and i used to think that was enough. i used to think that once i found love that would be the be all and end all and that would fix everything else that was wrong (granted, that was back when i had a job, but still). it doesn't. i need more. i mean--please, part of my life that is Fixed and Good, don't ever go away, but i need more.      and now for something completely different:       i found this somewhere on the vast morass of the internet, and was so amused by it that i contemplated plagarizing it, but that would make y'all have a dramatically reduced distance from my life, and i would like to leave a little bit to the imagination. suffice it to say that there have been discussions this week about the fact that i can't sleep late anymore, like ever, and there are great parallels between this and what goes through my head on weekend mornings. it's from a weblogthing called  urlLink smitten  and i am including a link to it just to prove the fact that i did not write it. pbbbth. this link takes you to an exact replica of what you're about to read but if you, like me, consider reading other people's blogs a great and fascinating waste of time and judge of human intelligence (obviously, that's why you're here) you can probably take some amusement in this. perhaps it is a universal truth that girls wake up before boys: i'm awake. wake up, baby, wake up wake up wakeupwakeupwakeup. why isn't he waking up? but i'm NAKED here, why won't he wake up? am i losing my game?  let me try to kiss his back. nothing?!?  maybe if i poke him a little, he'll wake up. hmmph - nobody ignores ME and gets away with it...  maybe i'll push him. just a little. oomph. okay, so much for that idea.  should i jump on the bed? no, then he might wake up mad. but at least he'd be awake!  i know, i'll bite his shoulder. ooh! movement! no - he just rolled over and fell back asleep!  i want him to wake up now and pay attention to me! grrr. maybe i should let him sleep. naah.  i give up. i'm taking a shower. i'm mad at him. i wonder if he knows we just got in a fight?  back from shower, to the sleeping mass under my covers: 'all right, mister. i tried to be nice, but you've left me no choice.'

       i want my old friends. i want my old face. i want my old mind. fuck this time and place.    the rock shop is no more. being the intrepid facts-reporter that i am, i was going to provide some sort of link to it, but google is failing me, it seems. there is the more depressing alternative, also, that nobody cares about it. feh.  the rock shop was a club in 'stallis that provided not only music, but apparently wet tshirt contests and mud wrestling. while that does not fit my definition of what a club should offer, it still saddens me because the news briefly interviewed the owner and he looked very young, and he said simply something along the lines of "i lost everything." according to the news report i saw they still don't know what caused it. and yes, they were dicks to crime & judy (so i heard) but that doesn't mean that their karmic retribution is to lose everything in a  fire.  jeez.     speaking of crime & judy: they are playing this saturday with seam at mad planet. 10 p.m., suckers. woohoo.       once again i am going mildly crazy with the cold & the being shut up inside & the lack of human contact. i have had an offer to go be a scenster tonight and as that is something i have not done in a long while i plan to take the offer.        the only other thing worth noting is that it is in fact possible to culinary-icly misstep with tofu; i did not feel like leaving the house to feed myself tonight and  had to Scrounge and Improvise. as i recently acquired this tofu and did not wish it to go bad, i made a stir-fry looking thing with the following:         olive oil         crumbled tofu         cheese & garlic powder leftover from an instant mashed potato mix thing         canned pineapple        walnuts        ketchup      actually, it was okay, except i think i used too much olive oil. i tell of this and of these ingredients purely to disgust one individual out there in particular; you know who you are.      ha ha ha.            soundtrack: ani difranco,  not a pretty girl       (out.)

       with you in a cold grave, i cannot stay warm        it's cold.      it's really fucking cold.      and in my infinite wisdom i left one of my gloves on my apartment floor when i left on friday so i was standing on greenfield avenue this morning with one hand in my pocket, the other gloved, cursing everything i could possibly think of. it is the type of cold where it takes your breath away. whilst i am normally a fan of that phrase i hate it when it's literally true.      saw  big fish  with matthew over the weekend and loved it. i really can't come up with any other way to describe it other than it takes your breath away (har). it brings up issues of mortality and fathers and sons and witches and love and while i am not by any means a scholar of tim burton films this is the best one of his that i can recall ever seeing.      i have shamelessly self-promoting poetry news:      1. i now have two poems up at mister eriq's website for such things, which you can see by clicking urlLink  here . there are some really lovely things up there besides my stuff, and i'm not saying that my stuff is lovely, i will reserve judgement. when i was in college i remember trying to present the argument that you are not a poet until someone recognizes you as such to a couple of my professors. i'm not sure if i believe that anymore but i am still reluctant to call myself a poet. i am more a Scribbler Of Painful Things. y'all can judge me but you can't hate on me.     2. and this is the poem that i randomly generated from (you don't say!) a random poetry generator site; it works sort of like a mad lib.  i admit that when i was of the age where i was supposed to be amused by madlibs i was not. amused. at. all, but i randomly came across this in matthew's presence last night and was giggling like a schoolgirl on quaaludes once the, um, cough, heartfelt product was completed. i'm sure he either still a) thinks i am fucking high or 2) feels vaguely superior to the girfriend who is amused by such things. as well he should. anyway, you can find  that  link  urlLink here . here's my poem:        Your skin glows like the banana, blossoms long as the daisy in the purest hope of spring. My heart follows your timpani voice and leaps like a ocelot at the whisper of your name. The evening floats in on a great sparrow wing. I am comforted by your bra that I carry into the twilight of barbed wirebeams and hold next to my toe.  I am filled with hope that I may dry your tears of oil.  As my neck falls from my socks, it reminds me of your belt.  In the quiet, I listen for the last cough of the day. My heated breast leaps to my dressy. I wait in the moonlight for your secret mouse so that we may conjugate as one, breast to breast, in search of the magnificient blue and mystical domain of love.            that's all. very little else has changed. i am still jobless. very little changes around here.       soundtrack: yes, "i've seen all good people/your move," which i still can't get out of my head ever since seeing "big fish."

       forever if i could, forever if i may   feeling lazy today and like anything that i have to say is irrelevant, so i am going to let other people's words speak for me. the lyrics you are about to read are significant in the following ways:    1. r.e.m. has written a song that DOES NOT SUCK--the first time in, like 10 years    2. it sums up my state of mind lately. whether that is good or bad or whether that is a copout or dramatic to let lyrics "speak" for me remains to be seen. but here you are,  read them, i need a shower:                                     "bad day"    (soundtrack: ryan adams, "so alive") (out)    a public service announcement followed me home the other day i paid it nevermind. go away. shit's so thick you could stir it with a stick free teflon whitewashed presidency we're sick of being jerked around wear that on your sleeve   broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, lord,  count your blessings. we're sick of being jerked around we all fall down.   have you ever seen the televised st. vitus subcommittee prize investigation dance? those-ants-in- pants glances. well, look behind the eyes it's a hallowed, hollow anesthesized "save my own ass, screw these guys" smoke and mirror lock down   broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, lord,  count your blessings. the papers wouldn't lie! i sigh.

       i live my life like i wasn't invited  hello.    it's snowing. it's very lovely. i am sitting in sweatpants and a bra which has become my, er, chosen workout apparel. next thing you know i'll be spitting and grabbing my crotch and yelling at my imaginary wife to get me another beer, bitch. whee.      today's topics have perhaps a thread of relevance between the two of them. but only a thread. i did my tae bo tape this morning after experimenting with other tapes from the library and barely being able to contain my laughter at how motherfucking stupid they are. i do not take direction from little white girls telling me "party over here" and teaching me how to dance hip hop whilst accompanied by a bad c & c music factory cover band complete with that little "squee!" effect that was so popular in that era, nor do i take well to someone telling me to "find the rhythm" because it's part of my "chakras" and that it "centers" my "balance." so it is back to billy blanks and his scary abs and scarier package.       but as i was kicking invisible things i started marveling, rather pompously, i'm sure, at how much the human body can do and how very strange it was that my shoulders were warm and how i am kicking this invisible object just by thinking "kick," when the word itself is such an abstraction, and that i rather like sweating, and that at this moment i am conscious of the fact that i am  alive , even though shortly after that fact i started visualizing aaliyah's stomach (not the way it looks now) and the way that i have muscles and hip bones and shoulder blades and they just function and fit and that's totally fucking strange....      so i'm having one of those "hey-neat-i-have-a-body!"days. i need to make up my fucking mind about the way i feel about it. but you knew that part already.     and i finished a book this morning called "girls" by this skeevy looking gentleman, nic kelman (they should outlaw author photographs on book covers, it really biases the reader) and i can't decide whether it's a) pretentious as hell, b) brilliant or c) completely offensive and misogynist. it is most likely all three. (the blurb on the back is written by jt leroy, king of enigmatic pretentiousness, so that was kind of a tipoff.) it is basically a series of blended quasifictional narratives (that changes narrators several times without announcing itself and you're like, "what the fuck?!) about infidelity and fifteen year old strippers from amsterdam and fucking the daughters of work colleagues and "friction dances" at strip clubs and trying to pass infidelity off as noble because odysseus and achilles did it and talked incessantly about it and boys-will-be-boys and follow-you-dick and all of that.      some excerpts: of course reprinted without permission:      "so believe me when i tell you that love is the printing press and the arcade version of centipede. believe me when i tell you that at the very best love is a brand-new thing. because no matter often we cancel the trip, say, 'no, you guys go on, i'm just going to relax at the lodge,' decide to do something quiet instead, no matter how often we can't find the energy for other things, we always have the energy to fuck them. whenever we have an opportunity to fuck them, the energy finds us."     "so there you are. hiding from your wife. on a wednesday night in one of your eleven bathrooms with your armani pants around your ankles. a forty-two-year-old man worth hundreds of millions of dollars, a king, masturbating like a schoolboy over a single page torn from  hustler  because you can't wait for the weekend. except it isn't a page from a magazine. it's a polaroid of [your mistress] on the beach."      "one out of every two marriages ends in divorce. four out of five spouses admit to cheating on their partner--we don't know how many of the remaining 20 percent are simply not admitting it....so who is it, exactly, that we think we're fooling?"      i think the reason why this has struck such a chord with me is the fact that it's so graphic and so descriptive about the ways that men think about and what they do with women who they are not with and that i do not ever, ever want to end up being a statistic, i do not ever want to fall out of love or even consider cheating, yet this man basically says that i will. i can't fathom that and am quite resentful of the implication. what the fuck makes him so sure?      it's a lot to think about.        soundtrack: wilco,  summerteeth       (out.)

       you're gonna make me lonesome when you go        jawohl. i am back. again. i did not die while skiing. however, it seems that my personal style of skiing is as follows: [cry] [be terrified] [lose balance] [get on rope tow] [fall] [get up] [ski ten feet] [fall] [get up][ski ten more feet] [fall] [repeat ad infinitum]. i am not proud of this. however in a strange way i feel better about myself for doing it rather than never having tried it at all. or at least that's what has helped me get out of bed for the past two days. and it was a good time overall; our team won trivial pursuit (furthering the delusion that i, in fact, Know Things), but i got my ass kicked at uno more times than i can count, and i was introduced for the first time to the glory that is peanut butter oreos. a girl really can't ask for more.       i really don't have much else to report. i paid off my fine at the library which was on my card since, um, last april or so, and now have enough of all possible mediums of entertainment to keep me occupied for the next fortnight. too bad some of the things are due in a week. (the first center for independence meeting was yesterdayand the biggest revelation from that was that this finding gainful employment deal is going to take a looooooooong tiiiiiiiiiiiiime.) i also spent this morning inadvertently fucking up mattie j's keyboard, which leads me to believe that despite any and all contrary reports i should not be let out of the house, ever, and especially not around other people's possessions.          i am sorry, dear.      the  urlLink plea for peace 2004  tentative tour lineup has just been announced. i can hardly contain myself.      and now i am off to kick at the air.      soundtrack: bob dylan,  blood on the tracks

       first i learn to crawl, then some other strokes       hello.       my computer de my casa has kicked...something. matthew swears it's not the bucket, but i am skeptical. i got a new  urlLink wallpaper thingy  yesterday and the next time i turned it on it mysteriously withheld all of my windows folders from me, up to and including my startup toolbar.  so i'm mildly pissed but all it really means is that i will have to actually find productive things to do with my day until boy gets a chance to look at it ("no, i will not fix your computer." i am so sorry). like return my videos to blockbuster. and look for "uptown girls."  oh, i'm so embarrassed...ever since i saw brittany murphy bumping uglies in a factory with eminem i have been sickly fascinated by her and her littleness and her blondeness while simultaneously thinking that she  used  to be an example of normal-girl size in hollywood (around the time of "clueless") and something very, very drastic happened and she is either very sick or very addicted to something. because changes like that just don't happen naturally.      feh.      today's mood is slightly sleepy and lackadaisical. and something else i can't quite name. all i want to do is listen to morphine and blow smoke rings at the ceiling, if that gives you any indication. and due to the state of things outside i am really not looking forward to taking the hour-and-a-goddamn-half bus ride home. i am happy that it finally snowed, though.      i feel like i should have accomplished something this week. once again i am holding off on accomplishing things which are Great and Mighty (like job things) because i do not have the meeting with the milwaukee center for independence until monday. and it is so cold that i lack motivation to go canvassing the neighborhood for a crap job that i wouldn't take anyway. but there is so little variety in my days now. i'm at some sort of crossroads that i am not entirely comfortable with, but once again i  should  be embracing my freetime while i have it. i think.      this weekend, it was decided yesterday, i am going skiing. downhill. now i have crosscountry skiied before and enjoyed the hell out of it, but ever since my neighbor nils ran headfirst into a tree while skiing and was in a coma for a couple hours when i was twelve i made a pact with myself never to ski ever ever ever. this is not to say that the pact is still valid, i'm just saying i've never been before. and i am slightly nervous. more than slightly. i have spent a great deal of my life doing things that people (teachers, doctors, therapists, etc.) said that i couldn't do, but that doesn't mean that part of me also believes that i can't do a fucking thing.        and on that note.      this will be the last post until my puter gets fixed, i think. i don't wish matthew to believe that i am only in this relationship for his computer. i mean, it's the truth, i just don't want him to believe it.       ha ha ha ha. i slay me.      and if you don't hear from me by mid next week, it means that i ran into a bear while skiing and was mauled and am probably an (uninsured)(eep) vegetable lying in a hospital somewhere.   soundtrack: morphine, "you speak my language"         (out.)

       fat is a feminist issue   lo, i have returned from a weekend of "the red shoe diaries," which i admit i didn't have the highest of hopes for but 75% of it proved nearly unwatchable (the parts where david duchovny conversed with his dog were swell, though), watching the snow, playing the best game of pool i have literally ever played (which meant having four balls on the table at the end and winning because my opponent knocked the cue ball and the eight ball in at once)  and having a demon sore throat with stuff coming out of it. bleurgh.      so i am going to take a minute to address the demon that followed me for part of the weekend and for most of my life. not the sore throat, but the thing that is probably responsible for the sore throat (without giving you too much detail): my Issues With My Body. i grew up a pudgy, bespectacled, be-headgeared and be-legbraced child. i internalized much too much during those years. now i am not pudgy. i am not waifish, nor will i ever be, but neither am i terribly offensive. in fact there are  those who say that i am beautiful. there are times when i agree with them. it's just the times that i don't agree with them that are really, really fucking scary.       the way i lost the pudginess once i got to college was not the healthiest way one goes about doing these things. granted, i exercised. and weight trained and got my arms to such a permanent satisfactory point that i still occasionally demand that people feel my biceps. but i was also borderline bulimic. and when not being bulimic i did things like chainsmoke and take diet pills and drink coffee and eat a box of macaroni & cheese (with fat free margarine) (i can still tell you the exact location of the fat-free dairy products in any given grocery store) a day and that was it. and for some reason when i got more normal (i use that word lightly. obviously) my metabolism was at a point that i didn't gain anything back.  but the demon still lives in me. the demon typically manifests itself once or twice a month. it shudders when it sees a picture of me with my stomach--my perfectly normal, unobtrusive stomach--showing, and it wreaks havoc. on me.       it's like i'm bipolar. the rational college educated me has read  the beauty myth  and refused after a point to take place in conversations with my friends about how fat we all are and you-look-so-cute and i-am-so-foul and knows that billions and billions of dollars are spent on the diet and beauty industry and it is such a crock of shit i can barely breathe.       the demon-little-girl-me knows that i am no different than any of them, any of those girls who surrepititiously pinch their fat while walking and hold their stomach in and refuse to have the lights on during sex because even though you find me ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH TO FUCKING SLEEP WITH, you cannot possibly LOOK AT ME without getting DISGUSTED. courtney love once talked about how eating is tied into sex, and her basic point was "if you can't eat, you can't fuck." of course she then turned around and had the plastic surgery bonus deluxe package, but whatever. the point is still valid.     the week of christmas i cried in front of my mother and sister because my mother said that i have a roll on my stomach. which is true; it's not toned by any stretch of the imagination. but the fact that i am so sensitive to that type of criticism (and am still doing bad, bad harmful things even though at a lesser frequency) makes me think that perhaps i need something outside of what i am already attempting to do. of course it is hard to get therapy when one is lacking insurance and unemployed. i hope that this attempt at regular exercise does something because i am at a loss otherwise.       and i know that my plight, as it were, is not unique in the least. i know that thousands, if not millions, of women (and men) will never be comfortable with the way that they look and let it rule their lives. i know that i am wasting a great deal of  my time and other people's time by obsessing even if it's infrequent. i know i am fucking myself up. it's just that none of that really comforts me.      and mr. eriq, if you are reading this, and congratulations if you and anyone else has gotten this far, i hope that you were serious about making me a compilation of pet shop boys songs, because i am seriously preparing a random girly mix cd to give to you in return.       random say anything quote of the day: "the bomb could go off, and even their mutant genes would form the same cliques."     soundtrack: r.e.m,  automatic for the people        (out.)

       who mistook these baths for showers? who fucked up that leaning tower?         ooh. i am the best mixtape maker ever. i just came across a tape that i never gave my friend which i am now listening to, which includes one of the greatest bands ever: the moldy peaches. today's headline is from "steak for chicken," a song which also includes the following line: "who mistook this crap for genius? who is gonna stroke my penis?" seriously. when i saw them live last year kimya dawson (female half of the band) was dressed as a bunny. you cannot ask for more from rock.      i would also like to announce that i have been betrayed by vh1. last night we rented "bachelor party" (tom hanks in the 80s before he won anything and therefore before he started thanking god for his shoelaces every time he was on a stage--in short before he was an insufferable fuckwit) because we saw it praised on "i love the 80s strikes back"  and it looked goofy and funny and dumb and resplendent with bad 80s hair. it was two of those things. i laughed maybe once. i feel violated. however, it was instructional in that i really had no concept of how much full-frontal female nudity was in 80s films. would that the nakedness saved the plot. would that the nudity in films corresponded to a lack of puritanism and hypocrisy about actual american sex lives. ooh, i could talk about that more but i'm already afraid i sound like an over-pseudo-intellectualizing twat.       that is all i have to report. i have no idea what i am going to do with the rest of the day besides the usual downloading of porn.     that's a JOKE, people.     i would get antsy and angsty about the fact that i have this vast ocean of idle time but i am beginning to concieve of the fact that there will come a time that i join the ranks of the working again (comrade) and that perhaps it would be a good idea to stop obsessing about things i can't control and just try to enjoy it while it lasts.      soundtrack: pavement, "harness your hopes."

       so this is the new year, and i have no resolution       hello.      here is a list of songs that i found about new years and/or just include new year's somewhere in the title:        urlLink azure ray , "the new year"        urlLink the casket lottery , "new year's eve"       little  urlLink rufus wainwright , "what are you doing new year's eve?"         urlLink  thursday , "jet black new year's"       urlLink jeff buckley ,  "new year's prayer"       urlLink death cab for cutie , "the new year"      and the inevitable         urlLink u2 , "new year's day."        i know it's a bit after the fact, but i need to feed my listmaking obsession somehow. the tradition on my end is to listen to "new year's day" every year and shiver at its beauty as well as the fact that bono is now a self-aggrandizing asshole. (if well intentioned.) i hope everyone had a good night and was not as asleep and full of pain the next morning as i was.  four (4) glasses of champagne plus other amounts of alcohol that i am afraid to go into because it's too embarrassing. i don't even LIKE getting drunk. somehow (matthew) i got home in one piece, though. apparently, and i only vaguely remembered this, i allowed my tattoos to be photographed for  urlLink eriq , which will be included in that portion of his page soon (i think).  (this is now officially the most links in one entry ever. i work hard because i love you all.)  today was spent recovering from my headache with non-headache pills which probably fucked up my liver even more because they are being used for the Wrong Purpose,  coffee, yogurt and granola. goddamn, i'm healthy. also copious amounts of "i love the 80s strikes back," which answered a question of matthew's about which celebrity i would Do (the answer being, alex, "who is michael ian black?" it's something about tall wiry boys with incredible senses of humor. i am like a moth to a candle. that does not just describe michael ian black, by the way). and i have discovered that i am not the only one who has love for "milkshake," by kelis." it fills the need for girls being the absolute opposite of coy and dancing around and being all skanky and innuendo-ing. seriously, the world needs more of that.          as i said last time, i don't have any resolutions mostly because i am very, very good at breaking them.       and that, i believe, is all the minutiae i have to report. i hope you all find me as fascinating as i find myself.      damn, where did THAT come from?      soundtrack: nothing (boy is sleeping).

       just remember, we're coming back for your children   let us now pause and praise the minutiae of an unemployed life. last night i drank too much red wine (2 glasses) and consequently fell asleep at 9:30. i am so fucking sad. it's great. also i'm still tired despite the fact that i have had lots of sleep.      it is finally beginning to look like spring, it's all sunny and lovely and made me sweat slightly from walking home from the latest mcfi appointment. which makes the fact that i am sleepy even more agitating. today's project involves making a cd that consists entirely of songs that contain hand claps for my sister's birthday. i have challenged her (adopts adam sandler voice: "CHALL-ANGE!") to make one to compete with mine. i, however, have the vast recources of the internet and make no bones about the fact that i'm kind of cheating, ha ha ha. and so i will WIN.        also, i really have to do my dishes.      before i bore any of you further, i implore you to note/follow the new link i have put up, to a typepad/blog deal called smitten, which i have been reading for about a month now and is written by a girl named deb. i really, really like it, and not just because i wish i got as many hits as her (i am getting wistful and greedy and still feel like the unpopular kid at the back of the class who wears jordache jeans instead of guess? and smells funny) or that she talks about sex more than me.

       update   i had the interview. i sent matthew several agitated text messages ten minutes before and five minutes directly after the interview.  i was supposed to have recieved a call between four and five this evening if they wished me to come in for a second interview. my phone, apart from my friend texting me to tell me to lick her ass, has remained silent all night.       it was basically like i remembered last time but with more details surfacing as to why i was not a proper fit for the job--the actual job involved a bunch of shadyish marketing packet creating for the brewers, among other companies, and (my interviewer explained) that it was essentially paid management training, and part of it involved running around and trying to sell people who lived in the neighborhood of (example) miller park, these brewer ticket packages. yes. well. anyway. and once i became good enough at this and other aspects of the job, i would be placed in one of their ever-expanding offices as a manager. the woman who interviewed me must have been my age, if not a little older, and that pissed me off. i don't know why.      but oh, walking downtown on water street at 1 in the afternoon...i felt like mary tyler moore.  i was going to Make It, After All. i felt like a vampire who had actually forgotten that she likes sunshine. i wanted to be those people, i wanted to put on my sneakers and rush off for a business lunch after i just get this fax done. i feel so far removed from society that it makes me  salivate   when i see it. in other words take away all the actual aspects of the job and i would have been perfect for it. to extend a metaphor in regards to this interview, though: it's like what happened with my ex boyfriend. we were not right for each other, and in the end i had eventually figured that out, but I WANTED TO BE THE ONE WHO DID THE DUMPING. (she held her head dramatically and announced)  i never should have showed up.        and now i am back in the shadows, nursing my wounds and wondering if this is ever going to end. to add to the general This Is A Portrait Of A Sad Sad Girl Indeed, i have purchased a pint of haagen daazs with the intent of consuming it, for dinner, while i bask in the overprivileged glorious teenage glory that is  urlLink the o.c.      ay, dios mio.       quote of the day, highly relevant and politicized,  see also: i wish i'd said it:                 '"i just want to say that I don't think the two biggest problems in america are that too many people want to commit their lives to one another 'til death do us part, and steroids and sports. i don't think those are our two biggest problems."                                 --meryl streep     soundtrack: elliott smith, "needle in the hay"    (out.)

       delerium tremens       so i have an interview in about an hour and fifteen minutes. my first one since becoming unemployed. something called the langdon promotional group. and no, i have no good reason as to why i am doing this instead of pacing and rehearsing answers to potential interview questions, so hush. perhaps that's an answer in and of itself...      herein lie the questions: 1. why are they interviewing me if i already met with them, like six months ago? my counselor has been using guerrila tactics getting my resume out, meaning she just faxes.mails my resume everywhere and anywhere. i hav a vague memory of interviewing with them, and expressed my reservations with the woman who called me.  the previous time the interview process was completely fucktipated. but she, this woman, claims they're under new management, and i am under the impression that i will be interviewed by one person instead of five boys who look much younger than me in suits at a long table. so that's promising...? 2. say things go well. say they love me to death. and why wouldn't they?  but  what if i don't want the job?  instinct tells me to take the first thing that comes along, be it a grabage disposal worker, topless dancer, etc. because the way i live my days is fucking with my head so badly and i just don't want to live like this anymore. but upon checking my mail today there were two (2) form letters back from two companies who i have a vague idea that i would prefer to work for them. but what if those don't work out? what do i do?       arrrrgh...     i know that only time and slightly better honed instincts that come with time will give me answers to this. but the bottom line is:      i want out.      now.      and i need to go and make myself look all pretty and professional (HA). time's a-wastin.       soundtrack: hot hot heat, "get in or get out."

       i'm sorry you got nowhere to go                                     (the therapy session.)  hello--     this weekend pretty much left me convinced that there is Something Really Messed Up In My Head. saturday i didn't do much of anything; so much so that it's not even worth recounting. then saturday evening i got a call from matthew asking if i wanted to go to dinner with about 9 people who had been drywalling his friend's new house all day. i said sure, thinking that a good time would be had, i know these people, i "helped" (if by "help" you mean "sit on the floor and read  glamour  magazine and then make several trips to true value to provide moral support") last weekend, cool. and/but. we got to dinner and beyond a few initial comments about how i am too short to see the top of matthew's head, reassuring hearty chortle, i clammed up. i literally had nothing to say. while "if you have nothing to say, don't talk" is a good policy under normal circumstances, it doesn't fly very well when you are at a dinner when the fucking  point  is to interact. i was all too aware of this. i then started freaking out about how bad i was clamming up and how it would look awkward and weird if i suddenly started being jovial after a half hour of silence and staring into space and looking horrifically uncomfortable. and then started freaking out because i didn't want to look like some sort of scary scary freak in front of matthew's friends but felt there was something physically preventing me from even smiling. and then started freaking out because i had already talked to half of these people in different various circumstances and i knew they didn't bite and didn't hate me so what the fuck is my PROBLEM?!?       it went on and on. to the point where i escaped to smoke a couple times (a couple times = bad news when one uses smoking as a crutch) and ended up near tears in the parking lot. and then  in  tears on the ride home without quite knowing where any of it was coming from. not pretty movie-star-pity-me-please tears either. this was the Demon Sobbing Ugly-fying Crying Monster From Hell. and  i was not able to adequately explain it to matthew. the most i could theorize was:       female problems       shyness, magnified and distorted and taken way too effing seriously       tendency to run with a feeling once i know it's there/name it      and matthew, to his credit, was beautiful. i would not have been beautiful to me. i would have kicked my ass. but that still doesn't make anything better. i want to delve into this deeper, i want to get a real reason that's not a theory, and the only way i can do that is probably by getting a goddamn shrink, which i cannot afford. i want something tangible that i can point a finger to so i can vow to Never Do That Again. can anyone relate to this? anyone at all? or am i the only person in the world who is scared of people?      the rest of the weekend was fine. we are now through season one of the sopranos, and i got to pretend that i have a lifestyle which is patently not my own on sunday by going to bally's and lifting weight things. it made me feel better, even if i can only bench 37.5 pounds.  soundtrack: the strokes, "meet me in the bathroom"  (out.)

       keep my name out of your mouth   hmph. no feedback yet.  of course there is an exception, so  urlLink don't you go yelling at me .       as i am, unlike tlc, too proud to beg, i'm not going to solicit comments or repeat the request to tell me how this page should look AGAIN (see the numbered links below) or just tell me how the hell you found this site/what you think of it if it's your first time here or even if it's not and even if i know and/or love you already because i am insanely curious and in need of positive reinforcement, because that would just be silly. i don't need you. really. i don't.   i mean, i put the comment function up  purely  for my health.      ooer, i'm a snot. lookit snotty mcsnotpants over here.       urlLink here  is a link to a list of rules for audiences of rock.        and i am including it because i honestly don't have that much more to say. i have supersecretspy plans for  urlLink someone's   wee arse tonight (plot plot plot) but i can't really disclose them because i'd have to kill you. i wish that phrase hadn't become such a cliche. i do love it so.      enjoy your respective weekends. i know you're out there.       soundtrack: my bloody valentine, "kiss the eclipse")     (out.)

       the finalists    it is 8:39 a.m. and i have been up for an hour after rediscovering my stupendous karaoke vocal talents, my text messaging envy (which is really fun but confusing for the recipient if you're not using your own phone, and especially fun when you're under the influence of the next item) and vodka gimlets last night. four (4) of them. to coin a phrase, i'm hurty. but never has "i want you to want me" been given a more heartfelt treatment.  also my worrisome side is worried about the amount my friend drinks and the fact that  every  story she told last night either started with or ended with "i was so trashed..." this is the friend who, upon catching her exboyfriend who she is still obsessed with in bed with another girl, tried to kill herself with wine and multiple antidepressant pills and ended up in the hospital where she recieved both stomach pumping and charcoal for her stomach....      but that's a completely different story.     something else altogether: the people who do  urlLink rathergood.com  have done a commercial for quizno's. i am amused as all hell that they keep popping up everywhere.    anyway. we will keep this short. i've been browsing blogskins. please vote. please oh please. and/or give me more ideas of where to find skins.        urlLink number one        urlLink number two       urlLink   number three              urlLink number four         urlLink number five          okay thanks bye.      soundtrack: nada surf,  let go      (out.)

       there's a girl in my yard reading to me tarot cards she don't know anything but she's beautiful to me        i had a dream last night that  urlLink eriq  was a midget who stole some money from a carnie, along with his midget friend whose name i did not retain from the dream, and they were shot and killed for stealing the money even though the events of the dream made it clear that they did not, in fact, steal anything.     strange days.    okay, if i have done this right there is now a comment feature on this blog. this is to serve one purpose, primarily--i would like anyone who reads this to give me an opinion on what skin i should pick for this here page. (and, of course, comment on anything else you feel like. i haven't been called a whiny self-important bitch enough lately.)  i am sick of the way it looks again. i am very sick of the butterflies and the general girliness. of course if i have not done the comment setup right i am going to look like some extra-special kind of fool and will once again have to enlist matthew's services because i'm "some kind of super idiot" (TM). if it does work, expect several links to the finalists. depending on the type of reaction i get from my teeming fan base (cough, snort) i may take the comment function down once it has served its purpose.        so that's all for today. no more messy emotional stuff for now. i'm too drained. expect the links next time. and please, someone send me a comment so i can see if i did this right.       random say anything quote:  "the rain on my car is a baptism, the new me, ice man, power lloyd, my assault on the world begins now."        thanks to imdb.com. which i know all of you know about already, and once again i am paleolithic in my web-functionness, but i no longer have to look at stupid angelfire pages to accumulate my quote selections.  soundtrack:  urlLink pilot to gunner ,  get saved       (out.)

       i will stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days        first of all, i really wish i knew how to put images on here. this will have to do:       urlLink go here, please.            the feeling of stupidity and of being lost continues. i was supposed to go to a job fair today at the state fair grounds, so the plan was that i was going to do other things in the morning,  take the hour goddamn ride in the afternoon, get there around two, network and smile pretty and hand out my resume, and then hang out with matthew's cat afterwards until he got back from work, beings that the state fair grounds is about eight blocks from his house. i am hanging out with his cat, but i did no networking at all. why? because i am a fucking idiot. i spent about a half hour wandering around the fairgrounds--i wish i had a camera; there are fewer things more desolate than state fair park in winter--looking for some sort of sign or a full parking lot or  something  indicating "hey! yes! you! job fair over here!" i finally left after i had circled the grounds a few times, realizing that even if i  did  find a way in i would probably not had enough time to do anything in a professional, unhurried manner seeing that it closed at three.       i've never even been to a job fair before so i have no idea if it was even worth my time. rumor has it that they are largely populated with stuff like roundy's and mcdonald's and things. the point is, i didn't find out either way. and i don't remember why i didn't show up at the last job fair that my counselor told me about, but i didn't. and nothing is changing. and i am supposed to have an active hand in all of this and i feel like i'm letting my self  down, never mind anyone else. i don't know what else to do.      i think in my head i am partially afraid. of what, i have no idea. but crying doesn't help anymore. frustration doesn't help.  not that it ever did.      in other news, i am finally joining the late twentieth century. i have a cell phone. or will once matthew works out all the glitches, of which apparently there are many. impressed? aren't you? huh? huh?    and i learned two things from an anonymous source with whom i drank delerium tremens last night (it was poetically fitting) (and hush, i got my state refund check, so i can spend money slightly more than once every leap year now, albeit cautiously):      1. mod night is dead, long live mod night. apparently the noble brothers, who spun records at mad planet every thursday, want to start playing "other things." i will never be able to witness the brian gallagher dance again. and neither will you. i am distraught.      2. when bayshore mall has its big hoohah revovation later this year or next year or something, barnes & fuckble is not going to come back. or so goes the rumor. suckers. of course, this means that there is going to be at least  one  unemployed baby daddy. (...) unless they have some sort of employee relocation program. i have no idea. i am smug anyway.   and yes, i am probably going to hell.      also:     3. a second anonymous source told me that two more people have recently quit, one of whom was a manager. which gives me more & more confidence that what happened in my case really, really wasn't because of me.       urlLink really, really.

       well i think i'm losing my mind this time said i think i'm losing my mind that's right said i think i'm losing my mind this time, this time i'm losing my mind        hello.       today is not going well. i am sitting at matthew's house completely impotent and unable to go home because i think i hope oh god i left my wallet in his car (if it's anyplace else i am in much trouble) and i am waiting for him to bring it back and i feel like a damn housewife. okay. breathe. so i am doing this to expel nervous energy and to try and refrain from playing the What-If game. also, i did not file for this week's unemployment check until this morning. i am supposed to do it on sundays. the only possible badness that could come out of that is i'll just get it a day later, but still. goddamn. where is my mind?      this weekend was good. as a result i am the proud owner of a crime & judy button, amusing memories of boys beating the crap out of ceilings, leftover pasta, and a pair of american eagle outfitters low-rise ho-jeans. i officially publically take this forum to vow that by this time next year my wardrobe will be entirely ho-riffic and -resplendent. the rest of the details of what happened on valentine's day are not for you, but suffice it to say that i now officially hold the title of Massive Unabashed Buying Into All The Crap Hypocrite. and i like it.       this is not to say that i can't get into the spirit of dissing it. nor can i possibly resist a singer who titles his songs "fuck it( i don't want you back)" and seems to have created an  urlLink entire album in the spirit of hating on the bitches . this article, by the way, is by one of my favorite writers. enjoy it.      so basically all is said and done and i don't have any major holidays to consume me for a while. and once i get my fucking wallet back, things will be much much better.       all right, i have to go pace and worry and tear apart a house that does not belong to me some more now.        soundtrack: the accusing voices in my head.

       enough.   i learned today that our government has nothing better to do than beat a dead horse. they had hearings about nipplegate today wherein this republican senator lady from new mexico accused the fcc of "knowing EXACTLY what you were doing, and...lining your pockets," among other people and other things.  urlLink here  is a link to a lengthier article about what all went down.     fucking hell. the more we let this snowball, the closer we are toeing the line of outright censorship. some of the programming that the networks are reassessing and   changing is completely unbelievable. in my mind, this is just confirming how afraid we are of any form of sexuality as a country. and the fact that we're making SUCH a goddamn huge deal out of it is just going to open the floodgates for more and more reactionary, heavily right wing viewpoints to become acceptable. the hearings were primarily aimed at network television, but from what i understand there were also unveiled threats made to cable television as well, something about taking a long look at themselves.  big brother is watching you.  soundtrack: azure ray, "favorite cities" (out.)

       the great remains of a friendship, scarred   today is/was another one of those fairly bleak days where i wandered downtown a lot and dropped off applications and thought about how i used to wish i could stay home/not work during the day because i Missed So Much Of What Goes On in the world. now i realize that very little goes on except people going back and forth from their jobs, and those who don't are unemployed and pathetic like me. the emily visit and concert was fun, but exhausting. don't ask me why, please. and my mother sent along groceries for matthew, a gesture which confused him very much. also sphinx the cat may have leukemia. he sat in matthew's bathtub for 95% of the weekend and did not eat anything and looked at us balefully. and so matthew took him to the vet this morning, and leukemia was one of the scary possibilities (of course i have forgotten all the other possibilities because i am horribly overdramatic). i feel like i could use a good bathtub sit myself.       also, when i got on the bus after handing in job application #43 it was with a group of about 20 eight year old children who apparently had just gone to the museum. one of them sat next to me and asked what my name was, and i got his name, which was diablo or something (i swear to god). he was very cute and small and everything. i go back and forth about kids--i don't know if i want to hate them or join them or save them.       this is the part that disturbs me: as the kids were watching the bus television and yelling out the letters to the word searches and whatnot this commercial came on that strikingly resembled a rap video. i have no idea what it was advertising, but there were cars and guys throwing hand gestures at the camera and girlies dancing around in bikini tops and daisy dukes. and these kids went out of their  minds . they wanted to go to the place that was advertised, even though i am reasonably sure an actual place was not being advertised. and this diablo kid was yelling "oooooo! look at that GIRL!" and they were talking about the cars and the "dudes." i'm sitting there thinking, what the fuck? you are eight. are you really objectifying women at this age? i honestly wanted to corner him and his friends and say "look. women like this aren't real. you are going to grow up with horribly distorted perceptions of wealth and relationships and value shallow measures of success and YOU NEED TO STOP LOOKING NOW GO READ A BOOK. FUCKING PLAY KICKBALL.  HAVE A CHILDHOOD. JESUS." of course i did not say this because swearing at children is bad. i know that kids today are a lot more aware of these things than i ever was but it doesn't make it right that they're showing this shit on the BUS. nor that they responded so eagerly to it, even though that was the advertisement's point. it made me really, really, inexplicably sad. it was a conscious flash of a thought that existed as well, that i want to go and counteract this somehow.       the problem with me is that i don't  know  how. nor anything else about what i want to do with my life.      and the valentine's day problem has a solution now. i have a plan. i am plotting. be very afraid    (matthew).  BWA HA HA HA HA.  soundtrack: the shins, "kissing the lipless"  (out.)

       you've got a nerve to be asking a favor; you've got a nerve to be calling my number; can't you hear me? i'm bleeding on the wall         i have spent $12.07 of my hard-earned unemployment money on the new  urlLink walkmen  cd. but i justify this purchase in the following ways: 1. i  neeeeeeeeeeeded  it. 2. i did my state income taxes last night and i am getting a lot more than $12.07 back. it remains to be seen what i am getting back from federal; but i have never had to pay anything before and i do not think that's going to change now. 3. wait, let me back up: the walkmen are coming! the walkmen are coming! seriously, they're coming at the beginning of march to mad planet and i, being the serious pretentious asshole that i am, need to begin memorizing lyrics now.      side note: i didn't know where else to fit this in, so i am mentioning it here: apparently this site has been added to some sort of search engine on spirituality. i cannot tell you which one because i deleted the email asking me for permission to add it.  after i thought about the possibilities of Power, Recognition and Glory being a search engine result might bring, i thought "what the hell."  to the best of my figurings i'm "spiritual" because someone stumbled across the posts where i had links to definitions of gnosticism back when i was obsessed with  the matrix reloaded . creepy! there may be hardcore christians praying for my soul right now!     bleeeeeeah.      i am writing this at a standing-only terminal at the downtown library; i had an overwhelming, all-encompassing desire to reread  the bell jar  and this is the only feasible location that had a copy. or so the computer says; i have not gone into the stacks yet. i hope that my choice of reading material does not reflect my mental state to you, reader, because today i'm feeling pretty good.     there are 5 job leads that my access for independence counselor is hardcore pursuing.     and i beat the emogame version 2.0 last night.     and maritime is playing tomorrow and my sister is making another milwaukee appearance.      and i have enough cash to buy my awakened-at-7-by-yippy-dogs ass more coffee.      things are swell.     soundtrack: the walkmen,  bows & arrows      (out.)

       i'm not one for handouts, no they can make our shoes    urlLink death cab for cutie is coming! death cab for cutie is coming!  ohmigod!      now that i am done impersonating a thirteen year old, i can continue with my day. which i think is going to involve passing the hell out somewhere. i would like to say that i had a long dark night of the soul, but alas--it involved reading sarah vowell until 10:30 whilst angelique was over at my apartment writing a resume and then having the movie festival and then watching, of all things, "blind date" until 2 because i couldn't sleep. incidentally, sarah vowell is now one of my favorite writers by sheer merit of the fact that she titled one of her essays "tom cruise makes me nervous."      all the coffee in the world could not help me right now. couple those facts with the waking up at 7:40 and not being able to go back to sleep, and THEN add the fact that i just finished watching  y tu mama tambien   and i am now torn between wanting to go back to sleep and wanting to go to certain peoples' places of employment and  forcing them into a back corner and demanding that they tear my clothes off RIGHT NOW (it was  that  kind of movie) and basically, in the words of the rolling stones, you can't always get what you want. and i cannot instantly gratify either of these. especially the sleeping part. yes. sleeping. mmm-hmmm.      heh.       i would claim some sort of embarrassment and/or delete that entire last paragraph, but one of my new years' resolutions was to be more like anais nin. okay, i'm totally lying, but i hate the fact that i'm still halfway conditioned to be ashamed of or defensive about the fact that i have desires and often, quite often, act on them and am therefore human. so fuck all y'all. (see what i mean about the defensive?)      and besides:  y tu mama tambien  is a really beautiful film. and it wouldn't have been the same without the threesome.     and besides that: i could be one of those people who crosses over from being sexy to just plain ridiculous in my writings, like  urlLink this here . i have three coherent thoughts about the content of this blog:         1. ew.        2. you are the most pretentious people alive and for the sake of the future i hope  you never breed.        3. ew.       now with that thought, i'm a continue on with my day. we'll see which goals/immediate/ongoing desires get fulfilled. woot. (w00t?)      and from now on, if i allude to, you know, icky things that are done in dark closets or with implements or props or make your palms hairy or make you go blind or make you see stars or make you go to hell, no more apologies or self deprecation. i'm tired of it.        soundtrack: desapareceidos, "survival of the fittest"               (out.)

       525,600 minutes   all right, so there is something very, very wrong with me. i found myself choking back sobs when listening to the soundtrack to  rent  on the bus this morning. like, what do i have to cry about? no one i know is dying. the whole premise of  rent  is all with the guy having aids and has a year to live and existentialism and "no day but today" and yadda yadda yadda. perhaps i just have amazing powers of empathy and therefore rule. um.       in an attempt to cheer myself up i am listening to the  clueless  soundtrack. but dammit, it's that counting crows psychedelic furs cover which has also been known to make me cry. some of the most beautiful lyrics ever uttered in song: "the race is on, i'm on your side, hearing you my engines die/i'm in the mood for you, or for running away." jesus. those weepy british people.      all right, song's done. i'm all better.    so it seems that everyone is talking about  urlLink janet jackson and justin timberlake and her breast and the superbowl and the whatnot.   my question is: who the fuck cares? i do not really hold miss janet in the category that i do michael, meaning that i don't necessarily think her back catalogue is fantastic, even though i had  rhythm nation  back in the day. no good music= no reason for me to care about her sorry i'm-38-and-my-career-is-gone-but-you-can't-tell-can-you? stunt. and as much as i adore mr. timberlake, he's about 15 minutes away from becoming a  behind the music  his damn self. i  would  like to know, though, where you get the doohickey that covered her nipple. that was badass.      so this weekend was good, if a bit anticlimactic: emily did not see the friend who she was supposed to meet and who had been telling her since the beginning of january "the 31st! the 31st!" and so we tried to amuse her for a night. half of my friends did not show up, you bastards. we also saw a real live piano bar, which was crowded and third-wardy and upon our entering the piano man was playing, um, "piano man." that did not bode well. (i like to keep my drinking cliche-free.) so we left. sunday was spent sledding and narrowly avoiding fences and small children, and then watching films. on the roster was "bad boys 2" and "go," which includes one of my favorite dialogue exchanges ever:      random white boy: "my mother's mother was black."      taye diggs: "my mother's mother's mother's mother....n***a, this ain't roots!"      i can't explain why i find that so hilarious; i just do.       and now it is back to the week. and monday. and routines and situps and trying to figure out where the money for my next phone bill/cup of coffee/heroin fix will come from. and to occupy time tonight i have rented all three of the films that i suggested yesterday and  urlLink someone  pitched a fit about. pbbbth. they are as follows:        "raising victor vargas"        "spellbound"        "y tu mama tambien."     i only namecheck them to illustrate to you, the reader, what stellar, exemplary taste in films i have.     and that's all the news that's fit to print. still no job/lottery winnings/anonymous donor of rufus wainwright tickets.       soundtrack:  clueless  (still)     (out.)

       day five   okay, so there has been some wall-climbing. especially tonight; i went over to amy's for round 2 of the  his & her circumstances  marathon and she is capable of smoking more than anyone i've ever seen; there were several times that even though i was tempted to throttle her and demand that she give me one, i made it. and she was very good about the whole thing and went outside to smoke. and the fact that my apartment is blessed with thin walls and as i write this i am listening to a nasty-ass smoker's cough that is not mine makes me think that maybe i'm going to be okay after all.      and between the shuttling back and forth between west allis and the east side and keeping up with the bally's and going in for appointments with temp agencies because i don't know what the fuck else to do and am getting scared, i am exhausted and once again not thinking i have anything valid to say. and i have no  reason  to be exhausted. i'm  unemployed .      it just doesn't make any sense.        soundtrack: nothing (need to hear myself think right now)       (out.)

       cryptic        the thing about slowly emerging from this type of sick is that i am tired all the time. and i really, really just wanna go lie down. but i have to fix my apartment so my sister doesn't reveal the awful truth to the rest of my family that i live like a slovenly barmaid/wench/mole, cause she's coming for death cab for cutie tonight. and i just don't want to do anything at alllllllll.       i will confine my musings to that.        also, there was a message left on my machine about my resume from a (as far as i know)  legitimate place of employment.        !!!!!!       i won't be speaking to the woman who left it again until monday, so i have approximately 72 hours in which to hope and wonder (and hope and hope and hope and hope...).      i'm still very skittish after the last time.      wish me luck, y'all.       merry weekend.      soundtrack: the liars, "mr your on fire mr"     (out.)

       quit if you're through with it, you are gonna make me sick        apologies for the MIA-ness. as predicted the throat tickle exploded, and i was sicker than i have been for a long time. all week. still am. this is fever and cold spells, coughing for an hour at a time, having an appetite so diminished that the only thing my stomach will accept is vegetarian boullion and saltines, fuck-you-we're-taking-you-over sick. have also made a friend sick and i fear for matthew very, very much. this brings me to Thing One of Two that will be discussed today:      i am quitting smoking. tomorrow is d-day. i have tried to do this several times before but i think my heart wasn't really in it; there is a certain part of every smoker who is in love with the ennui and the whole self-destruct aspect of it all. i would be lying if i said i have suddenly started hating smoking. this is not going to be easy, but the reality is that it is going to  kill me  if i don't. i am tired of getting the same illnesses every two months. i am tired of being worried about my breath all of the time. i am tired of my nonsmoker friends making faces and waving smoke away if i am out at a bar with them or something. most of all, i am tired of being a statistic. women my age are the most likely to be aware of the hazards of smoking yet the least likely to quit. that's fucked up, y'all. for anyone who reads this and knows me in real life, donations to the carrot sticks/chewing gum/pencil/nicorette (we'll see if the last one's necessary, but i'm not above it) fund will be graciously accepted.         even more alarming, i bring you Thing Two of Two:      the  bush administration has ruled that federal employees will now have no means to fight back if they are fired or demoted for being gay. and the white house is removing gay rights information for employees from all government webpages.      urlLink  go here, please.      i really don't know what to say about this. i am not very good at being eloquent about things that make me this angry. and somehow just saying "i'm going to move to fucking canada" seems really trite. how did the world get to be like this?  soundtrack: modest mouse,  the moon & antarctica    (out)

       i'm glad that you came, i needed someone to look up to         you know, fuck these three dollar juice smoothie things that allegedly have echinacea. fuck 'em. they're not doing anything for me right now, and i'm petrified to exert any effort on anything because there is a telltale you-have-been-out-too-much-this-week-and-now-you-are-going-to-pay-dearly tickle thing at the back of my throat. i have this (perhaps) misguided notion that if i go back to sleep or otherwise wait it out it will go away. of course, cigarettes contain vitamin c, so i should smoke  much   much more and that will help.      argh.      the rhetorical question of the day is: why blog?      this is a question that has been nibbling at the back of my mind for several weeks now--i know that i have alluded several times to wanting more hits and whatnot and wanting Fame Power and Glory, but seriously, i just went back over those entries and  since when do i talk like that? i do not. the power of the internet is very strange. this think can't even be defined as a subculture anymore (i don't actually know if it ever was) but it's HUGE. do i really think that someone is going to happen across this, pluck me out of obscurity, and praise my exemplary and awe-inspiring writing skills? i do not. but i think partly i do, and i wonder about that as well. i am what you would call a secret exhibitionist, and i am wondering if maybe the entire world is made up of them. what makes us think we are all so special and fascinating that we need to publicize our every move and thought? why bother? i know that there are sites that i am drawn to and read very frequently, and i think that it has something to do with getting out of my own head. but the sites that i do read regularly are  so  well written that it makes me want to hide my head in the sand and then go get a job as a subway sandwich artist rather than ever attempt anything that good.       and i am afraid i do not have any answers to these questions. if there is someone out there who does, i would appreciate hearing from you. if you write a blog,  why ?   if you are reading this one and have done so more than once,  what the fuck is wrong with you?  i mean,  why?    soundtrack: broadcast, "city in progress" (out.)

       you're smothering me             so it's almost spring. how about them apples. i got extremely (checking euphemism dictionary)... happy  on red bull and vodka last night; not because it was saint patrick's day, mind you, but because i decided i desperately needed a change in my routine. the only thing that i see worthwhile about that holiday is mocking all the people with green things on their heads. the other activities of yesterday included watching three hours or so of an anime series called  urlLink his and her circumstances  with my friend amy, whom i had heretofore understood to be a completely cynical human being. also her dog chewed the foam pieces off my walkman headphones, which was pleasant. but this series? this series. omg, it's the cutest thing ever. omg, i just said omg.      anyway, crime & judy is playing again tomorrow night, and other than that and the extremely disturbing dream i had this morning wherein there was a hairless cat with matthew's voice and a fucked up human looking face in bed with me trying to convince me that he was actually my  fish  and then trying to  hit on me , i have little to report.      when i was on the exercise bike at bally's today the 12:00 news was on and there was footage of the florida man who shot his entire family and then they cut to the latest series of bombings in baghdad, and i was sitting there thinking not only is my world relatively insular and comparatively sheltered, it is also extremely fucking surreal.      i don't think that i like people much right now.          soundtrack: wilco, "cars can't escape"    (out.)

       the bet          if there is anything wrong with my relationship, it is that there is a severe reluctance on the part of the person who is not typing this to give me cookies. i don't know how this started but am amused by how long the joke seems to have extended itself. wait, did i say joke? i meant dire circumstance. i will periodically demand cookies--i even threatened to bake them myself yesterday while he was out, instead drinking an entire bottle of wine and making a pure ass out of myself (but that story is not for you). so he has bet me that if i can go for three years without crying over anything with the exception of films, then and only then i will get a cookie. as of noon today i was halfway through day 1,095. then i went through the latest pile of online job applications and got a rejection notice from one of them TWO MINUTES AFTER I APPLIED. how does this happen? how do they do that? and i was close to tears. i admit it. matthew, i fail. i have said this before and i will say it again: i am terrified that none of this is going to lead anywhere. i feel like i'm wasting my time. i am terrified of what happens next.      other than the story that is not for you and the fact that as a result of it my wrist inexplicably hurts a lot, this weekend was good. filled with a lot of movies and a lot of alone time. which was not so good. i think that my heart is hungover. i feel like any sense of optimism i had left has been crushed beneath an eighteen wheeler.      i don't know what i'm doing anymore.

           another prop has occupied my time            so it is bright and shiny outside. what am i doing inside writing this? my lunch date was cancelled, and so i have been sitting here for a half hour while my ass goes numb writing followup emails to the places my resume has been sent so far and envisioning what will happen when my unemployment runs out and i have to move to west allis and become an angry unemployed quasi-housewife. yeah. (just kidding,  urlLink baby. )        we are through season 2 of the sopranos and it's all i can do to stop the flood of memories that are coming back about what happened in the third season the last time i made a hobby of watching them, and furthermore stop myself from vocalizing them, for fear i will get whacked and sleep with the fishes. and oh: my suckerfish is dead, speaking of fishes. he has become a homicide victim. oliver, the last remaining fish, has been persecuting him ever since he arrived in the tank, and when i went to feed them yesterday morning the suckerfish was naught but a tiny set of fish bones that had been virtually picked clean. i was very upset, especially since this now means i either have to start cleaning the tank myself or get a suckerfish who can defend himself.  suckerfish: with a vengeance.       there is so much that i could be doing. there is so much that i need to do. there is so much motivation that i absolutely lack.      so from the depths of stagnant irrelevance,      i sign myself      (out.)

       all my dreams have fallen flat       hello. i'm back.     the walkmen show was fantastic, despite or perhaps because of the fact that we saw the lead singer totally blow off this girl that i remember seeing at every other show i've been to by running away from her as soon as she went to the bathroom. and the opening band, the french kicks, covered "mad world," tears for fears style...and the walkmen fucked up the intro to "wake up" and then mumbled something apologetic and frankly adorable about how they blow out an amp or something every time they're in milwaukee...and they  played an Actual Encore...and i generally had a good time and was up until three. which led to exhaustion upon rising at 7:00 the next morning and not being able to get back to sleep, but i'll get to that. you suck for not being there.      and i suppose i suck or something for not showing up to the aforementioned illegitimate baby mamma party; i was wavering and indecisive up until an hour before we should have left for it and i finally looked at matthew and yelled "you! make the decision for me! be a man! decide things!" and he sighed and grumbled that it wasn't his decision to make, and it really wasn't, but he decided. and we did not go. and i think in the end that it was much better that way.      the lack of sleep combined with the new Punishing Workout that i now intend to put myself through five days a week turned me into a flesh-eating zombie yesterday (without the actual flesh-eating part). afterwards it was a bunch of running errands half-asleep and feeling lonely and Very Sorry For Myself Indeed, as not being around people has begun to make me feel like a ghost. helpfully, my rockstar friend showed up unannounced last night  just as i was really getting on a streak with the self-pity thing and we made a ghetto fabulous dinner at her house, and then i passed out from the sulfites in the red wine and the exhaustion.       and this morning i found myself sobbing over a news story about this kid with cerebral palsy who has become a cross country runner and in this one race all of his teammates came back out after they'd finished and ran the last mile with him; completely surrounding him. i.need.to.stop.crying.at.random.shit.      i feel the need to apologize for the minutiae this entry has covered. see, i'm even boring you.       two new obsessions: waiting for my literary guilty pleasure,  the gossip girl series, to come out with its fifth book,  urlLink i like it like that ...it won't be out until may. fucking hell. yes, i read the princess diaries, too, wanna fight?       and this here:              urlLink televisionwithoutpity.com        soundtrack: omd, "if you leave"      (fully milking the lack of serotonin)       (out.)

       styles upon styles upon styles is what i have        today got off to a kind of rocky start. upon coming home and practicing my organization method of dump-everything-on-the-floor i learned that my cd walkman cannot, in fact, survive being walked over by doc martens. neither could my copy of  urlLink slanted & enchanted  despite the fact that stephen malkmus is my superhero. argh. and because i am still in this pissed-off-for-being-so-dependent-on-material-goods mode, for which i entirely blame chuck palahniuk, i am halfway annoyed that i literally went straight out of the house to buy a replacement at the godsend/enabler 24-hour walgreens. but when you take the bus as much as i do, a walkman is damn near equivalent to breathing. (there is a segment of a  urlLink personality test  that claims that if you often wear a walkman/sing along to yourself, it speaks to the fact that you're introverted. fuck that, i just hate you.)       but it's a really good walkman...       and today marks nine months for matthew & i. nine months of being exhilarated and amazed and amused and loved and excited and occasionally worried and safe and stimulated and feeling like no matter what comes next everything is going to be okay, because he is always going to be there.      and baby, if you're reading this, you know that i will too. but i'm saying it again.           soundtrack: a tribe called quest,  the low end theory        (out.)

       you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. you are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of  the world.       okay, so i have spent some of my refund. i bought a new spring coat. it makes me look like audrey hepburn, i swear. (snort.) and my 5,000,000th black t-shirt. and i am officially the gap's bitch. and i am running out of things to say because i am running on about 5 hours of sleep. and the coffee is doing nothing. and i want to go back to sleep but it is ten in the morning and it's hard enough for me to reconcile myself with the fact that i don't leave matthew's until around now when i stay at his place--i feel like a sloth with much less fur and without the hanging upside down part. i was reminded last night of what a fantastic film  fight club  is. (the second thing that it reminded me of was the irony of the fact that had bought a coat not hours earlier that i love, not because it is from the gap, but because i just like the way i look in it. for anyone who knows me, me liking myself in anything is incredibly rare. if i were truly enlightened, though, i would go around in the same clothes for weeks on end and convert the energy that i would have spent finding the coat in the first place into saving the world. bad consumer. bad!)  i was also reminded why it is a good idea to eat at regular intervals throughout the day and why deep fried food items and i generally do not get along.      so things are pretty quiet. if they were quieter, though, i would be able to go back to sleep.      and this is How You Know That You Have A Problem With A Certain Television Program, Part One (of probably many):        when your boyfriend kisses you goodbye in the morning and adds "enjoy the o.c. tonight."      oh fuck.      soundtrack: kind of like spitting, "blue period"     (out.)

       it's just that when you touch me i cannot stand up   i would like to announce that i have had my federal refund check in my savings account for 4 hours now and i have NOT SPENT ANY OF IT (except for paying my stupid library fine so i could use this computer and get the books i have on hold--they had better be worth it) YET. i'm like fucking alan greenspan over here. and granted, the stores i went into with the quasi-intention of buying girly clothing for the sheer frivolity of it charged $38 for a fucking t-shirt, but that's beside the point. right?     so the sky is in a state of strangeness right now--light and rain and the ability to see my breath all at once--and the atmosphere inside the library is that of rarefied squalling children. i'm a little on edge.       two letters recieved from prospective places of employment, one telling me they went with someone else and one saying they are Carefully Considering My Resume Blah Blah Blah. nothing new. and so i really have little to report, except that i had nightmares last night about the woman who played tony soprano's mother. this weekend was good, albeit slightly muddy. also the handclap project (tm) turned out fantastically, and i would go into detail but i fear that my sister might actually look at this here thing occasionally.      i also have to make a decision whether or not to attend a party this weekend for the Bastard Child Of The Ex-Boyfriend Who Knocked Up My Ex-Best Friend And Is Therefore An Idiot. a lot of people who i know and love are going to be there and it's being thrown by a lady who understands completely if i do not show up. but the way i feel about the two (impregnator and impregnate-ee) of them currently is subject to question. part of me thinks that that whole drama (and it  was  the drama-iest drama that ever drama-ed) was such a long time ago that it shouldn't matter whether or not i show up and i will be a Much Better Person If I Can Put All Of This Behind Me And Act Like A Reasonable Human Being. another,  much smaller part still wants to smash their faces into fucking hamburger, to paraphrase mr. soprano or the writers who gave him that dialogue. the rest of me realizes that i still have a lot of thinking to do.       i mean, what would  you  do?          quote of the day, non-say anything related:       "i was going for stealth... and it's slimming."-seth cohen,  the o.c.   soundtrack: sleater-kinney, "turn it on" (out.)

        " variations on the word 'sleep'"        hello. i have this heaviness in my eyes that is preventing me from being completely awake yet. in honor of that i leave you with a margaret atwood poem as well as the Strangest Link Ever (see links section).  happy weekend. here it is supposed to be rainy and cold. i may go to madison to visit my mom and see my sister's orchestra concert, but i haven't decided that yet. that is all. goodnight.       (end)  I would like to watch you sleeping, which may not happen. I would like to watch you, sleeping. I would like to sleep with you, to enter your sleep as its smooth dark wave slides over my head  and walk with you through that lucent wavering forest of bluegreen leaves with its watery sun & three moons towards the cave where you must descend, towards your worst fear  I would like to give you the silver branch, the small white flower, the one word that will protect you from the grief at the center of your dream, from the grief at the center. I would like to follow you up the long stairway again & become the boat that would row you back carefully, a flame in two cupped hands to where your body lies beside me, and you enter it as easily as breathing in  I would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only. I would like to be that unnoticed & that necessary.   	-- Margaret Atwood

         do not go gently into that good night              so my mother is in the hospital with pneumonia. while it could be something worse, i am really scared and helpless-feeling and the  urlLink whatif monster  is back and thriving. i talked to her tonight & she said that the doctors kept pushing back her release date, and because of the medication she's on she tends to not speak as clearly as she usually does, so i don't know what any of it  means .  (she's not completely disoriented; it's just that she tends to forget what she was saying quite a bit, something i remember her doing when i was younger.) she also said that diabetic jello is the most disgusting thing ever created. heh.      so i have been thinking about death a little today.      my mom smoked for thirty years on top of having heavy asthma. after she finally quit she was so sick that she only retains about a third of her lung capacity. and as a result she is not going to bounce back from something like pneumonia as easily as other people. i knew that she was probably not going to live to be very old, but i didn't ever want to actually be confronted with her getting sick. i don't think this is serious enough to have a reason to be scared that she's going to DIE, but i am. call it fate, call it unresolved issues about whether there's a god or not, call it my melodramatic tendencies, and you'd probably be right about all of them.              it may seem like it's just one thing after another with me. yo, how do you think it  feels ? just when i have consciously decided that i am going to Be Okay, this comes along. part of me doesn't want to dwell and another part of me wants to go back home and tell her that i love her and i'm sorry for the years that we hated each other and i need more time, you can't go yet, you need to understand that i need you.      fucking hell.      ...i don't think that i have anything else to say.     and for the love of god, please DON'T SMOKE.     ...i can't believe i just wrote that. i am amazed.      that is all.      soundtrack: rem, "half a world away."

       these ideas of the ruling class should not be the ruling ideas        things are not as bleak as they were yesterday. i don't have any one concrete thing to point to & say "this is why i am better." here are some contributing factors:     *i apologized to matthew for keeping him awake until 1 in the morning asking him to list things that i am actually good at, and that felt better.      *i talked to four (4) People Who Were Not Matthew on the phone. as much as i adore him, i equally adore having other contacts left in the world from my former life and the "real" "world" which i sometimes am not so sure i inhabit anymore.      * i am going to see  urlLink radio 4  tomorrow and i suspect that hearing a bunch of punks yell about  various societal injustices (but it's got a beat and you can dance to it) will help me snap out of this whole self-pitying crap.     * i watched "the swan" tonight and was gleeful at realizing that i am not in any way affiliated with the fox network, nor am i One Of Those People Who Actually Seriously Watches That Crap. (uh.) nor, i think, do i need any extensive plastic surgery. i think.     *i read a trashy book from  urlLink this imprint that makes books that are bad xeroxes of  bridget jones's diary   and was gleeful at realizing that i am not man-or-baby-obsessed.     *while the nonsmoking thing is not effortless per se i have not regressed, and i've even been drunk/influenced by karaoke during the nonsmoking period. i have lost count of how many days but it's around three weeks. i even had several opportunities to smoke on one occasion because  urlLink the Princess  kept cutting out to do Princess-like things in the bathroom and left her nicotine on the table. i am a paragon of restraint.      *i have been told by more than four people, including matthew, that everything is going to be fine even though it seems awful right now. and while i know that they don't actually have amazing powers of foresight, i also realized that i am being more defeatist than i would like to be these days.       and so i ask you, reader, if you have gotten this far: how do you snap out of it when things are bleak? do you have rituals? mantras? what?            soundtrack: interpol, "stella was a diver and she was always down"     (end.)

       prettiest boy              beings that i am secretly insecure about my writing abilities, hell, abilities in  general  (and by saying that you understand that it translates to being completely obsessed with myself and who might be observing me), i occasionally go back and read reviews that i have written on  urlLink this website  looking for comments that people may or may not have written about them. i haven't written for the website in a while partly because i have been dealing with my own shit and partly because the last review i wrote was completely deconstructed and made fun of by some anonymous guy. which is reason #1 why i will never be a critic, or any sort of a writer, ever: i care too much about what people think of me. but this is not the reason i am all up in arms right now. someone had the following to say about a review that i wrote of  seven's travels  by atmosphere, back in january:        "It's so sad that this piece relies so heavily on the Eminem comparison when Slug is not even "white". But who cares? If your understanding of hip hop pivots on race or geography shut up."       urlLink  here  is a link to the original review.     basically, this is my rebuttal to this person because i don't have the guts to do it in the original forum.     people can say whatever they want. i am not denying this. and i suppose it's my fault that i didn't point out that slug, the rapper in question, is not actually 100% caucasian, a fact that i had researched and decided not to include in the review. though i can't find the exact information right now i recall that he has one black parent and one white parent.  because of his  appearance   a lot of people are going to assume that he is a white rapper. BECAUSE HE LOOKS WHITE. the media is fabulous at pigeonholing artists like this.  people  are fabulous at pigeonholing other people like this.   my  understanding of hiphop pivots on neither race nor geography; what i was saying was if atmosphere were to blow up any larger than they are now, slug is in danger of everyone ELSE doing it. the eminem comparison was based on appearance, yes, but more so because their lyrics share a great number of the same topics. race is and always will be a "pivotal" subject in hip hop, and if nothing else this is proof that it's always gonna be incendiary.       so what is this kid missing? am i missing something? did i accidentally write the most derogatory review on the face of the planet and my dreams of being a female cameron crowe (at ten years older than he was when he started) shot before anyone knows who i am? does everything pivot on race? am i racist for not addressing slug's lineage?am i racist because of the  eminem comparison? oh my god, what if someone hated my rufus wainwright review?      (sigh.)     have you ever tried to teach a cat to fetch? the results are hilarious.     soundtrack: tullycraft, "superboy & supergirl"     (end.)   p.s. anyone who cares to follow the hyperlink and has an answer to any of the last Paragraph Of Questions, any perspectives would be appreciated, even if you end up hating me.

       goddamnit   so i was in the middle of writing this long elaborate post apologizing for my lack of writings this week and talking about the  urlLink show  i went to in madison which was fantastic except for the audience and how  urlLink this band  broke up  the day they were supposed to play the show i saw  and my ennui in general and last night's antics wherein my friend, who is newly christened the  urlLink Princess   and i consumed an entire bottle of red wine each and  urlLink this song and  urlLink this song    were murdered (yes, it was detached-hipster-karaoke night again) and the fact that i have a developing obsession with  urlLink this  and this morning when i woke up it felt like  urlLink these  were nesting in my brain and  urlLink other various intelligent highly hyperlinked topics of note ...     and my computer bit it.     stupid goddamn machines.     it would have been beautifully excecuted, i'm telling you.      soundtrack: minus the bear, "we are not a football team"     (end.)

       note to self:        just because you have an extremely difficult time keeping your disgust at your own lack of physical prowess/athleticism in check does not mean that you get to inflict it upon the world at large. just because it's easy to shut down and give up doesn't mean that you get to anymore. just because you secretly think that your boyfriend would be much happier with a girl who could ski/play frisbee/ride a bicycle/run fast/climb things/etc/etc does not mean that you get to or even should remotely consider informing him of your opinion. just because you have never been good at athletic things and wished for grace for years and years and will  never  attain grace because of your--what's the technical name for it? hemiplegia-- does not mean that you are the only person on earth with problems and are therefore allowed to be Sullen and Hurt. in fact. you should be happy to  have  legs and arms. just because you are very good at being overdramatic about these things does not give you permission to do so.

       i wonder should i call you but i know just what you'll do        so apparently if you google the following: "west allis green tea samurai" you get matthew's 'about me' page, and if you google "sarah zion halloween muir" you get the first time in his journal that he talks about  me . aww. there was some weird way you get to my page through googling too but i am too tired to go find it again. i would just repost the entire im conversation, but i sincerely hate people who do that on their blogs.      i am not responsible for finding out any of this information, by the way.  the conversation last night degenerated way too much into the silly. i will admit that i could spend hours googling random shit were it not for the tiny fact that i get computer-induced headaches if i look at a monitor for too long. (and i expect to enter the workforce again?...)     i am exhausted and parts of me hurt that i didn't know were there. i have changed up parts of the Plan at The Gym. The Gym is capitalized when typed and said with a very grave, important voice when spoken cause i never dreamed that i was going to be one of those people who went to The Gym, much less spoke about my experiences at The Gym. i can really only dream of being upwardly mobile at this point. there are certain people who are of the opinion that i should be pounding the pavement with my resume and for realz, be taking anything that i can get, and part of me agrees with this, but the rut i am in makes the concept of doing that entirely depressing. this is not to say that i haven't filled out a few applications for bank tellers and blockbuster peons and used-cd jockeys and taken temp agency tests and the like, but if i took a job like that wouldn't it put me back at square one on the Great Invisible Scale Of Unhappy and Underused?     i can honestly say that i have no idea. about anything. anymore. a sentiment which has been stated and re-stated here.        it has been finalized that i am going to the plea for peace tour, as long as emily doesn't screw anything up about getting the tickets. after i get back (it's in madison) i am embarking on putting together a riot because since  milwaukee  didn't get the tour, how are we to have any idea how to act like peaceful, non-anarchy-prone citizens?    who's with me?      soundtrack: archers of loaf, "south carolina"     (attica!.)

       apple core. back for more. who's your friend? ME.       am back.  memo to amy: are you happy now?      sometimes it takes a calf sucking on your hand to remind you that you're alive.          it was rather an uneventful weekend/week thus far. i have food in my refrigerator again, which is a typical result of visiting my parents. i also have a freezer door which appears to be frozen open and the perimeter is surrounded by about six inches of ice (note: this figure may be influenced by my lack of ability to estimate measurements correctly and/or flair for hyperbole.) i have never defrosted anything in my life; any tips anyone can offer would be appreciated.     to clarify the provocative (y'all are SICK) opening statement, one of the activities pursued this weekend was visiting a petting farm that my sister, who just turned 24, note that, wanted to go to. she, my brother and i were the only non-parents there above the age of ten, but it was good anyway. and yes, a calf did suck my fingers, for reasons that have yet to be understood by me. but animals, especially cute baby ones, have always had something of a calming effect, and they did help me to realize that things could actually be a hell of a lot worse.      other pursued activities included:     * watching  something's gotta give  with my entire family and being so embarrassed at certain points that i had to leave the room     * watching  finding nemo  , which i'd never seen, and  school of rock , which i love (there's really not that much to do in madison).      * being subjected by my mother to a blind oreo taste test, wherein she adamantly claimed that the ones with the blue filling taste way better than the regular white ones. everyone "passed" except my dad, whom i suspect was being obstinate.     * eating vast and copious amounts of candy, some of which i even saved (gasp)!       and that brings us into this week, in which i have basically not done much because Boy called in sick yesterday and i took it upon myself to be his florence nightingale, as it was an excellent excuse for not being alone (there, i said it) and codependent.      the worries have not at all diminished, but they have been back-burnured for the time being.      as ice cube would say: "i didn't even have to use my ak/today was a good day."       soundtrack: spoon,  girls can tell       number of days that my first glorious impression of  good news for people who love bad news   has held since its release: 9       (out.)

            hoo          i was listening to npr earlier and they just played a song as an outro to the last program, which was about teenage sex education, i guess.  the singer and instrumentation sounded like a bad prince clone & the chorus was as follows:     "we don't have to take our clothes off to have a good time, oh no." there was also some sort of reference to cherry wine. it was really, really funny, and by funny i mean appalling.     i am imagining sex ed classes in which the hapless instructor plays this song in an effort to be "hip" and "speak" and "relate" to the "kids" on their "level."      the situation with the crying is somewhat under control for now. i could theorize about serotonin levels or chemicals or chemical imbalances  but i am really not interested in revisiting any of that right now. i feel like i have come out of some sort of battle.      speaking of which, i craftily and stealthily infiltrated matthew's boys night last night and watched "we were soldiers," and have subsequently vowed never to infiltrate a boys night again. it's not that it was bad, or that his friends hissed or spat at me, although i have a great deal of difficulty taking mel gibson seriously in any context these days and giggled upon realizing that his character was both catholic and had 85 children.  it's just it was really excruciatingly violent. which is to be expected. (matt said that watching this film actually prepared me to be able to watch  kill bill vol. 1  , an invitation which i respectfully declined). the other thing that they apparently watch on a regular basis is  star trek enterprise  , in which i have no interest. give me my seth cohen.      right now i am having the age-old battle between napping and finding lunch-type sustenance. to better decide which one is going to win, i am going to stop writing.       (am going to parents' house this weekend and am using that as excuse if should happen to not update. have no religious bits whatsoever but have always celebrated heathen bunny part of easter. yay chocolate things and hard boiled eggs, which always seem to taste better when colored.)        happy easter, y'all.            soundtrack:  urlLink modest mouse , good news for people who love bad news               and  holy shit , it's amazing      (out.)

       god only knows what i'd be without you        if today was any indication or sign of what is to come, i am going to spend the entirety of the rest of this week curled up in bed crying as if someone kicked me.     i wasted so much time today, as i do many days; something about the time change made me extra tired and something about the fact that i didn't hear anything back about this interview i had on friday set off the crying spell. i was told i would get a call by wednesday if they want me; if they don't i'm going to get a letter. and while the good news is that there was nothing in the mail from them today, something in me thought that if they did want me, if there was a decision made, they would want to inform that person, you know, posthaste. ergo, dissolving into a Big Fucking Baby.      the fact that it's still 30 degrees everywhere (a cookie to anyone who gets that reference, said the smug indie rock girl) is contributing to all of this as well, i think. waiting for the bus and transferring buses and hurrying home with this chill in my bones--it feels like i have been cold forever. cold and lonely and utterly useless.      so basically i did the following, after i was done crying:       dropped off my rent, got enough groceries to last me through tonight (although my stomach is currently questioning that), played on the internet and read blogs devoted to the fascinating lives of high schoolers and mused about how none of them can spell to save their lives and i think it's nelly's/chingy's fault, applied for yet another job, watched horrible daytime television, finally finished  london fields ...quality alone time. yes sir.       and i think the television is what made me feel worse. i hereby take this forum to announce that i am drawing a contract with myself. ahem.       from now on, i refuse to allow myself to turn on the television between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.; the exceptions being the syndicated episodes of  dawson's creek  and the  simpsons , and then only if i am over at Boy's house.            speaking of Boy and joey potter, we watched  pieces of april  yesterday and Boy was properly horrified at the amount of estrogen in the script. i thought it was pretty good even though katie holmes's neck tattoo was completely and utterly unconvincing.      off to wallow and kill time for the rest of the evening. hey, the finale of  average joe two  is on....         someone please kill me.       soundtrack: juliana hatfield,  forever baby       (out.)

       rebel rebel, your face is a mess        there are certain things that i'm going to get cheap little thrills out of doing even when i'm eighty-five, i think:      * wearing doc martens with pretty skirts     * chewing my nails     * rolling down the window and putting my hand on the roof of the car when it's warm & sunny     * singing in the shower and/or along with my walkman, loudly     * dancing, even though i suspect i look like a moron when i do     * Doing It in public places     * eating an entire pint of haagen dazs and considering it a perfectly acceptable meal     * kissing for so long that you can actually feel your lips increasing in size     * doing stupid things to my hair     * being in any body of water, anywhere (i  have  heard bad things about the hudson river, even though i've never seen it)     * shaving my legs (i really can't explain this one)     * being bitten     * biting (gently)     * crying for the sake of release     *being too loud      *telling intentionally bad jokes       *exploiting the part of unemployment that allows me to lie in bed and listen to npr for an hour after my alarm has gone off four times already         *secretly being pleased with the size of my breasts      * splitting entire bottles of wine and getting sleepy and goofy     * going on earthworm sidewalk rescue missions after it rains      * having the feeling that somebody needs me.        add some more of your own. lots more. go on. i want to hear someone else's secrets, for a change.        soundtrack: the get up kids,  something to write home about         (out.)

                            void after      to start: a link. i kind of wanted to see  troy  until i started hearing a lot about the sucktacular suckiness. thanks to  urlLink this  via  occupation: girl , i don't have to.      lengthy excerpt:           Somewhere Else Inside the Palace of Troy  BRISEIS: Paris!  ACHILLES: Briseis!   BRISEIS: Paris!  ACHILLES: Briseis!   AGAMEMNON [grabs Briseis]: Oh, now we're gonna have some fun. I'm taking you home to work on your knees, Temple Babe, if you know what I mean and I think you do--   BRISEIS: *stabs Agamemnon in the neck*  AGAMEMNON: *dying* But... what about... Orestes and... Electra... they gotta kill my... *dies*  ACHILLES: Briseis!  BRISEIS: Achilles!   PARIS: *shoots Achilles in the heel*  BRISEIS: NOOOOOO!  PARIS: *gets his Legolas on, shoots Achilles 15 more times*  BRISEIS: PARIS, NOOOOOOOOOO!  PARIS: OH MY GOD, I FINALLY DO SOMETHING GOOD AND PEOPLE STILL YELL AT ME!  ACHILLES: Briseis, it's okay. Go with Paris. In the middle of war, you gave me peace. Or sex. Or something. It was real, yo.  BRISEIS: No!  ACHILLES: Briseis...go...  BRISEIS: No!  ACHILLES: Briseis...go...  BRISEIS: No!  ACHILLES: WOMAN, GET OUT OF HERE AND LET ME DIE.   PARIS: *drags Briseis off*  ACHILLES: *dies*  GREEK SOLDIERS: *woe*             hee hee hee hee hee hee.      and now for something completely different.       i thought that i was going to be starting work today but she wants me to come in at 8:00 tomorrow morning. and thus i am sadly thrust into the World Of Other People Who Are Awake At That Goddamn Hour. i feel a bit strange about the whole thing and i can't explain why.       there is a feeling that's been following me all day which i have only just now identified as loneliness. it is currently gnawing at my solar plexus and making me feel slightly nauseous. i want to call someone, mainly i want to call the boy, and express this to someone/him but i'm also afraid of being percieved as Needy. it's like my subconscious is reminding me of all the bad things about being unemployed so that i won't mind getting up early tomorrow so very much.      i have done very little today. i finished rereading  urlLink look at me   (whoa buddy, what's with the sudden and repeated literary namedropping?), called a friend from madison, dragged my sorry ass out to get a muffin and some coffee (sole means of sustenance thus far today--even my appetite is sleeping), got the call telling me not to come in today, and that's all. sloth has been seeping in, like sap in my veins, for the past five months now, and i can't really seem to shake it. and it feels even more expressed today. today is one of those quintessential spring days and i feel like i can't even enjoy it.      i have no idea what i'm going to do with the rest of my day but i know i need to get off the computer.     if i do post anything in the next 72 hours it will be abbreviated. i am going to two  urlLink rock   urlLink shows  and then  urlLink home  in the wee small hours of sunday morning, and as i have expressed here intermittently i am still afraid of what my parents would do if they found out about my well-documented drug use, rampant sex with strangers, taking candy from small children, etc. so happy memorial day, everyone. hoo and ray.            soundtrack. jeff buckley,  grace                  end.

        my love don't cost a thing...unless we divorce        heh. that line is from a spin article that i cut out and pasted on my computer at home, back when i was in the phase where every flat surface had to have something on it, and preferably something cooler than  you'd  ever heard of. now, since i have been broken by life (bites knuckle) i don't so much do that anymore. (also, more practically speaking, there's only so much space you can cover with crap in a studio.) i don't know why that line came to mind, as i'm on the laptop.       from the should-have-seen-that-coming department: turns out the job is 25 hours a week. and i have no choice but to take it, since the library clerk thing isn't a sure thing like i thought. my resume is just being submitted. oh. i am not terribly upset about it, though, thanks to my new prozac iv. kidding. i have trained myself to live on nothing and can meet my bills in sort of a timely fashion, i can do it a little longer. and there's a possibility for more hours. we'll see what happens.       and besides, i have much more important things to rant about:        urlLink sondre lerche .      i just bought  two way monologue  last night and i have concluded from listening to it that this boy has no right to exist. this is pretty much just another example of my ridiculousness but i have always been consoled by the fact that a lot of Beautiful People are, in fact, not so much with the smart. then here comes this beauuuuutiful (finnish? swedish? danish? i was too busy  panting over  cursing his photo gallery to read his bio) boy who is 21 and on his third album (!!!) which is stunning. stunning, i say. lyrically and musically. it's not fair. my perfectly ordered world of stereotypes which were meant to console me is supposed to remain intact. that was the one thing i was supposed to have that the Beautiful People Didn't (please no angry comments, my tongue is firmly in cheek here), goddamnit. well, i don't actually possess gifted songwriter abilities, but you know. sondre lerche, i  love  totally hate you.      so um go get the album, because it's really, really good.      and if you further wish to pattern your life after mine (because that's why you read this, right? to be just like me? because you think i'm cool? say it. SAY IT!) here is the first Book I'd Recommend On National Television Before Killing Myself If I Suddenly Woke Up In Oprah's Body (part one of a very special series [snort]):  urlLink an almost perfect moment . it sort of has the same feel that  urlLink the virgin suicides  has without the gruesome bits. i am very pleased with it so far.      and the nerdiness continues, because now i wanna go finish it.            soundtrack. pedro the lion,  achilles' heel       end.

                          under construction        this is a formal apology to all the people who have made comments recently, because when i redid the layout (about goddamn time, i say) i lost all the customizations. i am also going to rebuild the links sometime in the near future, so if i linked to you and you are not there anymore and are sad i'm sorry about that too. side note: i actually know some crap about html now and am fairly confident that i CAN rebuild the links section. amazing.       this weekend was spent uttering "i have a job!" at least sixty-five times, drinking bad champagne, failing to find a sendik's, avoiding tornadoes and making fun of crappy internet weather maps, and finally watching the fourth-season finale of the sopranos. i am now considering installing cable for a month so i can watch the fifth season. for reals. and/or ingratiating myself to Boy's friends who have cable further than i already have (which is not very much, i suspect they secretly think i am Insane and Moody. which are both accurate descriptions, i admit). my crush on james gandolfini is not waning in the LEAST, even though (and the entire rest of the world knew this like two years ago) he is turning into kind of a dick.      today i have an appointment to fill out work (did i mention that i have a job?)-related paperwork and make sure that i'm going to get insurance and ask other prevalent questions and everything, and then my sister is coming up from madison to see  urlLink mean girls  with me. apparently she cannot find anyone in the entire city of madison who wants to see it. i am very apprehensive about seeing this because tina fey is on my list of Greatest People Ever, and if my perception of her was shattered, i don't know what i would do.       so that is all for now.      i have a job.      yay.      soundtrack: mclusky,  the difference between me and you is that i'm not on fire        (end.)

       .       did i mention that i have a job? because i have a job.      *the above image, besides being one of my most favoritest pictures ever, is directed squarely at The Man. thank you.*     actually, not only do i have a job, i suddenly also have an offer from temp agency #1, being, of all things, a library clerk. and so i am considering two (2) job offers (!!!!!!!!!!) and have to get back to one of them on monday. the fact that this library clerkness pays more money than the other job to start and the fact that it is a shorter bus commute and the fact that i could do devilish things with my idea of a library clerk's wardrobe (insert porn soundtrack here)...     eep. sorry, did i write that?      but on the other hand it is filing and sorting and, well, being in a library. while my mother very much wants me to go back to school for library science my overall assessment of that idea is  wtf . odds are my existence would not actually mirror  urlLink parker posey's , even if i got a degree.. so i am now tormented by the classic Thing That People Are Tormented By: do i choose the job with a bit more soul (i am embarrassed to say that i don't know the name of the company i will potentially be working for, but i do know that it's something really, really silly) or do i go with the corporation which will allow me to not only pay my bills but have Bling? or do i have an inflated concept of what twelve dollars an hour can buy you? (me?)    ack. i don't know. i am leaning towards taking the small job, just because it's not so very anonymous and faceless and...temp. but Bling would be nice. as would working downtown (insert mary tyler moore theme here). what should i do? voice of reason, do you ever read this page?    in other news, we have had rain upon rain upon rain here this week, which has led to 50 degrees and fog at the end of may, as well as the  urlLink second largest (1.5 billion gallons!) sewage-dumping episode ever   this makes me very, very sad. and angry, because there's no way i'm going to get near lake michigan this summer. fuckers.       now it is off to do as much reading of library books (i'm such a rockstar) as i have decided that, whatever the outcome, i am going to treat this week like vacation. and this is what nerds do on vacation (when their Boys are off in the suburbs helping renovate houses, that is): we read. copiously.       soundtrack. m. doughty,  skittish   end.

       i want to ride my bicycle, i want to ride it where i like    .          there are certain issues which i am not going to address here, i.e. the last entry. while i don't wish to alienate anyone who reads this, it seems to me that there's nothing wrong with a former geekiest girl in the entire world semianonymously celebrating a random stranger's reaction to her body. i think that we as a human race exist on a certain subconscious level to look as pretty as possible to other people. ahem. i  am   trite. you should know this about me by now, readers. i am silly and ineffectual and secretly convinced i am fat and secretly convinced that i am shallow for thinking that i am secretly fat and socially retarded and too concerned about what random people who post comments to this site at 1 in the morning think of me and in general far too susceptible to criticism. ask the boy. for reals.      anyway.      we (amy, her dog and myself) finished  urlLink my second anime series ever  tonight. this series defies description and it taught me two japanese words due to the amount of times the characters repeated them. unfortunately as it is two hours later and i have been exhausted all day i have forgotten them.      i had recurring dreams about the interview that i had today last night and kept waking up. i was terrified that i was going to fuck it up because i was so tired, but i was told, and i quote, by the interviewer, "i like your vibe. i get a good vibe from you." i'm like "i...try?" (didn't actually say that.) but i am more optimistic about this one than i have been about any of the others, mostly because the job would involve working with local musicians, or at least working for a company that works with them. and who better than me to do that? i mean, really. so stay tuned, kids, there may actually be more to come.        question for the public: is reality tv any better if it's  urlLink on pbs?       soundtrack: gang of four, "not great men"      (end.)

             on catcalls, ryan seacrest and the ever-elusive quality of happiness         i am grinning ear-to-ear right now. warning: what i am about to say will possibly set feminism fifty years back.       i was walking down the street this morning and this darling mopheaded college-looking boy in a who pulled up alongside at a stop sign. it took me a few minutes to actually process what happened next, but it did indeed happen:      boy (to self, in awed-sounding voice) "wow." (to me) "hi."      me: (huge grin, continues walking)      previously to this experience the only other time my physical self was commented on by a stranger was at one in the morning last summer when someone leaned out of a car to yell "nice tits" thereby angering the ex-who-is-now-someone's-babydaddy. while i have since come to agree with him, at the time it led to a heated discussion about objectification. (with me feeling secretly thrilled.) but this one was EVEN BETTER because--hey--i elicited a "wow."! little me! me of the formerly chubby and the bad perm! you like me! you really like me! it's very tricky to admit that i actually like the attention, but in this case the boost that it provided to my fragile self-esteem overrides any possible offendedness i might have felt. besides, who could be offended by "wow."?      my ego might not recover from this, people.      i spent the rest of the walk to the library, where i am writing this from, with that swelling, orchestral feeling in my stomach, and this is only partially due to the fact that i am obviously the hottest thing ever. it is also due to the fact that i have two (2) (ah, ha ha ha) interviews between now and monday. and couple that with the way that the air feels and the way the trees look and i have decidedly decided (?) once and for all, at least for the next half hour or so, that everything is going to be okay.      p.s. you may have noticed that i have changed the exit parenthetical declaration. that is because i only recently became aware of ryan seacrest and his "seacrest, out." ryan seacrest, as you may be aware, is a douchebag. i do not wish to create the impression that i am endorsing or imitating him.             soundtrack: temper temper, "sexy little cuts"      (end.)

                       the detour        i don't know what it's like in your city, but here the official arrival of summer is marked by the  expressions guys , a bunch of WGWDs (white guys with dreadlocks) who patrol the city streets trying to get you to buy their shitty magazine filled with shitty poetry. this is the type of magazine that does not reject any submissions ever and so it is filled with poetry like "baby, your hair/reminds me of the ocean/and i hope our love/lasts forever."  i have been battling one of them in particular for about three years now. for some goddamn reason he remembers me, and rather than tell him the first time i was solicited that i wasn't interested, i was polite and said "not today, i don't have any money." which led to months and months of him on campus/brady street/downtown getting this huge grin on his hippie be-dreadlocked face every time he saw me and yelling about how he saved a copy for me. instead of feeling special this inevitably led to me cursing all hippies and writers everywhere.      i saw him yesterday.      i was walking home from The Gym and saw him staked out on the exact spot of sidewalk that i needed to pass through so i could use the atm machine, in front of a walgreens. so it took me twenty minutes to get home, as i tried to walk around the block and discovered that every route i had to get back to the atm was blocked by fences. and it was just an atm. i was not going to get all  mission: impossible  over one machine.      finally, feeling sheepish, i got back to the spot i had started from and merely crossed the street.      and it made me think:      all this over one little hippie?      what am i afraid of, exactly?       (end)

       expect the best, accept the worst         tired again. kept waking up from very strange dreams (my entire family went to see an  urlLink r.kelly  biopic, my brother teased me about how r. kelly was my favorite singer, i got really mad and went home but then had to go back to the movie theatre to go to the bathroom, where my sister said dream-muffled sympathetic things, cut to my mom yelling at me for going home because i didn't have any money to be on my own [???], cut to me and my dad arguing about whether r. kelly was a pedophile and my dad blaming it on the damed liberal media).      my dreams this week have led me to believe that i am on the verge of certifiably insane. i also keep having a recurring dream wherein i tattoo my entire back. i would really like to know what that means (veiled plea for any dream experts who read this to comment). other than that, the status is...quo.       i need to start writing again. i miss it.       also i now realize that i fucked up the dylan thomas quote cited below. i am apparently a failed english major/poetry snot, too.      roughly three weeks left of unemployment. for real this time. temp agency #2 was applied at yesterday, and i have phone numbers and addresses of #'s 3, 4, 5 & 6. i have hope, even though this basically means that the milwaukee center for independence has failed me, as their goal was to place me in  long  term employment. i am a bit upset about that--it means that someone is getting paid for not doing their job properly, even though there are too many variables to be able to blame them completely. but it's the american way, finding scapegoats.       of course, my younger self already went through a phase where i  urlLink romanticized temping , so this won't be so bad. playing dress up and getting people coffee? sure. completely worthwhile, lifelong use of my degree.      (sigh)      the rest of the week was spent being horrified by the situation with the iraqi prisoners, commuting between 'stallis and my apartment as i am Too Fragile To Be Alone, exhausting both locations' supplies of coffee, correcting the commas in my sister's paper on hegemonic masculinity and superheros, which was very good, and thinking more about going back to school.     also, doing a lot of things that have turned into Stories Which Are Not For You.      (there is a difference between embracing my sexuality as a post-feminism feminist and turning this into  penthouse forum . or  urlLink this , for that matter. you could argue, "why bother mentioning it, then?" it is because the part of me that when i was fourteen was convinced that i was going to die unloved and fat and ugly and half-eaten by alsatian wolves is so shocked that i  have   a sex life that i have to point that out to anyone who will listen. neener neener neener.     ...         i think the fact that i have mentioned coffee twice in two paragraphs means that my subconscious is desperately trying to tell me something. on that note,      happy weekend, y'all.        soundtrack: jawbreaker,  dear you       (end.)

       don't give me your heartbeat cause i've had enough        you know, i really don't have anything to say. matthew's cat has been follwing me from room to room and mewing at me pitifully the whole 45 minutes that i've been awake, and i would be really pretentious if i mused about how it meant that something Needs Me, so i won't. also i have no idea how it happened but this wee blog has somehow accumulated over 1,000 hits, which probably means that i come up in some weird pornography google search. my mother is out of the hospital. it is spring. which means that the whole waiting/finding things to do with my day while waiting for work has become less of an annoyance. go go gadget springtime!      there is nothing terribly exciting in the works for this week. oh, i now own the urlLink  book i referenced about a month  ago  and am terribly  mortified  uh, pleased and smug about my own eclecticism. saturday night matthew went to a lan party and i rented  urlLink an incredibly  embarrasing movie  and watched it and LIKED IT, even though it totally fucked up the book. sometimes you just need to give yourself over to fairy tales, even if they have been disneyfied.        (edit: i discovered while researching a link to the film that disney is, in fact, producing a sequel that AGAIN has nothing to do with the books, and will not be featuring the schwartzman-brother-who-is-not-jason-but-was-incredibly-endearing, and i am officially getting a bit annoyed. off pointless soapbox.)   whilst renting this one of matthew's friends called and matthew disclosed  what i was renting, whereupon i beat him. with fists of fury. oh yes. whereupon he retorted "if you're too ashamed to rent these things, should you be renting them at all?"      that is a good point.      new project: embracing all that is girly about me.      step one: wear more pink.      oh, jesus...            soundtrack: whiskeytown, "ticket time"       (end.)

        be a star, and fall down somewhere next to me        This week I am at home "doing work" while my "boss" is on a "photo shoot." The shoot is somewhere in the city limits so at least I can call her if I get finished with this project in the next 48 hours, which I suspect will happen. Hell, I may get more hours than I normally do when I go in. My finances are calculated at being sufficiently sort of afloat-ish so this Stiff Upper Lip mode is still intact, reasonably.      To summarize this weekend:      Liz Phair played "Fuck and Run" whilst wearing a Britney-esque headset microphone thing, which made me sad      The Darkness theorized onstage that the FCC stood for "Fucking Cunt Cunters," which made my sister and I giggle for about 20 minutes      I ate more Krispy Kremes than should be allowed, which made me...feel bloated?      I heard people say "YEAH! WH-AT?" and "OKAAAAAY!" every fifteen feet. Just so you people know, I am planning to forcibly outlaw everyone who is not Dave Chappelle or Lil John from saying that when I become Queen/President.      ...And it looks like I shall have to continue this update later as I am late for an  urlLink anime date .         end, ish.

                           teh winnar!     is  urlLink http://www.obfuscatedgirl.com , and if you find the domain name incredibly pretentious and please-love-me-I-am-sad-and-I-also-know-a-big-word that is too bad, because NO ONE PLAYED ALONG AND GAVE ME ANY SUGGESTIONS AT ALL YOU BITCHES (I am slightly ashamed that I'm back to whoring myself/begging/cursing for comments). There is very little set up at that address as of yet, but with the help of Boy I am someday soon going to be gradually moving my archives over to the new domain name and making it all pretty and adding all sorts of crap. Yes sir.      Today I had the day off from my Incredibly!Taxing!Job and therefore did very little. Mailed off the 30 Seconds To Mars cd, where the woman at the post office laughed at me because I clearly had  no  idea how to insure a package. Had an appointment with job people, aka The People Who Got Me This Stupid Job In The First Place (TPWGMTSJITFP), who were suitably appalled when I disclosed how I spent my Tuesday at work:  cleaning makeup . Oh yes. My boss is going on a photo shoot next week and therefore I spent two hours emptying two gigundor duffel bags full of Ziploc bags of makeup and wiping down each individual piece, along with sharpening all the dull eye and lip pencils. Also: She wasn't there all day, so I couldn't ask her whether or not this was really part of my job description. Also also: I cut my thumb on a pencil sharpener. Worker's comp! The reason that I am not boilingly angry about this anymore is because I continue to get calls from temp agencies; got one again today, and something will eventually happen with one of those if nothing else, right? It has to, right?     It has to.       There is so much of my self-worth tied up in whether or not I am working. I'm sure that I'm not the only one who's ever gone on a drinking binge because I hate my job; however, I am  also  sure that I am the only person who has allowed that reason that things are wrong to spiral into Everything Is The Reason and end up crying drunkenly in a bathroom about how ugly I am (you will note that this has nothing to do with working). Part of me is shocked that Boy puts up with any of it.      I also have a new obsession that I am slightly worried about:  urlLink guacamole-flavored Doritos . They don't...quite...taste like guacamole, yet I keep eating them as if I can find out what exactly they do taste like. I tend to justify junk-food binges by treating them as if they were meals. I also have in the past claimed that Doritos are, like, a totally healthy junk food because they're low calorie ish and lower fat than other chips. Also, the fifth ingredient per the bag is MSG. Sweet.        So what did we learn from today/resolve for the future?       1. If I find out tomorrow that I do not get this temp job, either, I  will not cry.       2. I should go to the gym more often than I do. Because I'm totally fat.      3.I was kidding about #2.      4. I should also be thankful for every second that I am not cleansing other people's makeup collections and --ghaa--touching their stray hairs. I should also thank the people who make my non-makeup-cleansing time bearable more often.      listening to: Bright Eyes, "You Will..."             //end//

                     DOING IT A LOT IS OKAY        Grrrr.      No, seriously,  grrrr .      These are my complaints with today: 1. it is raining and while NPR must have told me that it would rain about fifty times this morning before I left, I did not take my umbrella with me and now I smell and resemble a wet dog. Happy Summer Freaking Solstice. 2. My financial situation tells me that I can only go to Summerfest once this week, as entrance tickets are  FREAKING TWELVE DOLLARS , but my sister has been yapping about going two nights and I suspect there is going to be a fight. I hate arguing with her and have a feeling that I'm just going to back down. Because I always do. Also, my boss asked me if I was planning to see anything and I told her that my sister wants to go on Thursday but I was trying to talk her out of it because I wouldn't do very well on 5 hours of sleep (the Darkness plays at 11:00 on Thursday) and my boss was like "oh, do you want to come in later Friday morning?" which would have been nice if she didn't mutter something thirty seconds later about maybe I wouldn't have to come in at  all . Which brings me to 3. I worked for TWO AND A HALF HOURS TODAY. I already asked her to please give me things to increase my hours and while that seemed to work for like two days, this is getting worse. The temp place is still looking for me, and nothing is ever permanent and things will get better and at-least-I-have-a-job &c., but  damn , it sucks right now. 4. A very good friend of mine who is in roughly the same financial situation as me has bid on  urlLink something I'm selling on eBay   to pay bills, which makes me feel horribly, horribly guilty even though she says it's because her friend would really like it. Agh. 5. I just spent $11 to clear my library fine, even though I really can't afford to do it, because my copy of   urlLink Annie Hall   has come in, and it's rainy and all I want to do is curl up in my bed and read library books. Even though I should be pavement-pounding. I don't have it in me today.      And the weekend? The first half/third/whatever was a drunken, embarassing mess, and I am shocked I made it through without smoking. What I Learned, though, was consciously deciding to get really drunk--one sidecar, two girly martinis and two shots drunk, and I am a rather small Piglet--so I don't have to think about anything is categorically, emphatically NOT a good idea.        I have been thinking idly-but-half-seriously about adding a PayPal donation link to this thing, a la  urlLink Smitten  and whoever that chick was who paid off her credit card debt by begging via website. Is that too whorish? Discuss. I also plan to auction off a  lot  more crap on eBay, therefore having now almost completely joined the 21st century. If you have a strange perverse desire to see what crap it is I own exactly, keep watching.       Listening to: Nothing. I'm in the library.     Had in my head for half the damn weekend because of the damn Great America commercial: The Vengaboys,  whatever that song is        end.     Edit/belated postscript: the eBay auction is roughly three hours away from closing and my friend is still the highest bidder. It's not that I don't want her to win, but someone out there, please, you've got to like Jared Leto's godawful band (I listened to it today to make absolute sure it was in good playing condition, and whilst the condition is good, the music is, in fact, awful. Wait, this isn't the best way to be selling things, is it?).

                   MAMACITA, PAPADANA              So I have been convinced to keep writing this (I'm sure you're all exhaling with relief). For the record, The Girl  was  at  urlLink the show  and I have come to justify people's tendencies to namedrop (incl., esp.: mine) and list their entire record collections on the internet thusly: The whole world is about searching for connections with people who are similar, about fighting loneliness. While it does morph into hipster death matches, hipsters need love too. Or, alternate theory, it's just another way of getting people to want to sleep with you, consciously or subconsciously. It's just like why people become musicians, except not. It is the way people are and always will be. I am now writing this sentence just because I want to see a sentence with the phrases "Marvin Gaye" and "seven inch" in it. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.      ...ahem.       I have almost completely worked through both of those sources of angst, and am now only being kept awake at night crying because I CAN'T EVEN GET A GODDAMN TEMP JOB IN A GODDAMN CALL CENTER (more on this in a second).  As far as The Girl herself goes, seeing her bitched out on a message board that she posts to (I know, I know, net-stalking is so  completely  sad, but at least I didn't leave anonymous hateful missives on said website or email her hateful missives or viruses, which I had...emphatically not EVER considered, not at any point) was enough to make me realize her true purpose in my life: Interweb soap-opera esque fodder. Like watching  The O.C.  and hating Marissa so much that you secretly hope she drinks so much that her liver fails before the start of next season, but at the same time you couldn't imagine hating anyone as much as you hate her so you don't want her to leave. The Girl, like Marissa, is a welcome target of misdirected rage.        The end. No more Girl stories. At least not until the  urlLink Ted Leo   urlLink show , which I know she will be at because of a) my luck and b) IT'S ON HER WEBSITE, DUH.      The Zen thing is working very well. Why on earth do you ask?      So yes, I literally was crying last night over this lack of temp job. It is not so much that I wanted the job, but i really wanted to get a paycheck for a two week period that was more than what I used to make at Barnes & Motherfuckingble in a  week . (I got paid--"paid"--today.) I feel like I have been blackballed from the Milwaukee job market. Or, exponential melodrama, THE ENTIRE JOB MARKET EVERYWHERE EVER (sniff)(snerk)(wail)(honk). The statistics about how long it takes to get back into the job market proper after losing one's job are alarming, but I always thought that I wouldn't become one, like having a degree would help me Rise Above, Praise The Lawd.      Please.       Expect very big changes coming soon around here. I have swung from one extreme to the other and now plan to take this journal off blogger completely and have my very own website (which will make me Matthew's bitch even more because I imagine he's going to end up doing 75% of the technical stuff, although I intend to be a Dutiful Student of Neat Internet Trick Thingies). I am taking ideas for a domain name. Seriously. I will consider everything and anything, and I will not ignore suggestions similar to             youthinkyourehotbutyouknowwhatyourenot.com            dieevilhipsterdie.com           chroniclesoftheunderempolyedwhowontshutuporsnapoutofit.com            jonstewartsbitch.com             etc.           go go go.        Tonight I am going to a Brewers game (shut it), and then afterwards to the urlLink  Safe House , where my mission, should the Safe House choose to accept it, is to consume a  urlLink Sidecar  (or five),  urlLink just like last time I was somewhere fancy .      Coming next week:  urlLink The   urlLink Summerfest   urlLink Diaries   urlLink !  urlLink ! ............ urlLink !          (and the sheer volume and scope of the linky happiness that's here should be an indication that i am feeling strangely somewhat better.)      now playing: Pavement,  Wowee Zowee            end   ps. the Doughty show was fantastic. This is but one of the reasons why:    "And as I fell asleep by the blue light of  Pimp My Ride /I heard Xibit say to me/Point your browser to: http://www.j_a_n_i_n_e.org."

                 We can wipe you out anytime.        Here's the deal. I am completely lost.       I have been spending a lot of time on the internet these past few weeks. This has led to several allergic reactions (I have discovered that I'm allergic to self-pity, which as you can imagine, makes it really hard to be me), one revelation (guess what--none of you lowercase-happy people are e.e. cummings! You never will be! Ever! And neither will I!) and the continued lack of answer to the question of whether I want to continue with this thing.      If you are not what you own, how is it that it seems like everywhere I look bloggers and typepaders and nightlifedotnetters are hollering about their record collections and their continued attempts at veganism, and their love for Audrey Tatou?  Does that make you better than me? Will listing all my favorite bands really make you like me better? Does the fact that I cleverly titled this entry with a song lyric make me a hypocrite?      I realized that I had a problem when I started stalking my archnemesis through the internet. Way back in the day,  urlLink the Princess  and I were at a  urlLink Faint  show (there I go namedropping again) and she almost got into a fight with this girl, whom we will call The Girl, because of some snotty remarks The Girl made about the Princess's cell phone, all of us being very close to the stage. Deeply relevant things to start fisticuffs over. Fisticuffs were averted (I don't remember how) and all of us went back to our lives, until the Princess and I started noticing The Girl at more and more shows.       Now, I see a lot of the same people at shows. The east side/Riverwest area is not as big as I once thought it was. But never have I seen people who consistently stand at the front and openly weep, or wear the same goddamn hat to every show, or boast on the internet (I didn't learn this until later) about their thirteen band-related tattoos, at least one of which was related to the Insane Clown Posse. OMGWTF. The Princess, being the gossip-savvy rockstar that she is, uncovered dirt about The Girl, and we quickly learned (or assumed) that she was the exact type of girl music fan that we hate, i.e. Girls Who Sleep With Rockstars (GWSWRS). It escalated, and her presence at shows became more intolerable ("OMG why is she going backstage which one of them is getting head now OMG LOOK she's crying again and WIPING HER EYES WITH HER ELBOWS SO EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SHE'S CRYING STOP IT STOP IT RIGHT NOW SHUT UP.") My designated show friends came to hate her almost as much as I did. Keep in mind that I never spoke a word to this girl in my life. i merely hated her with the type of hate that is only specific to girls, that is tinged with jealousy and flavored with completely uptight intolerance. I began laughingly referring to her as my archnemesis. (Who the fuck gets "Miss Misery" tattooed on the back of their goddamn neck? Who sits at the front of the stage crying with their head down for 20 minutes after the Clem Snide set is over?)       And then I discovered her Net-presence.        I found that she posts to the message board of a pretty big record label. Over the course of a month or so I started watching for her posts, and then I went so far as to Google her. I found her website. I read it. I read each of her message board posts. I seethed.       This is the thing:  I don't know why.  Yes, I found her presence at shows a bit difficult to take. But there was obviously something about her that rattled me. Part of it is because I don't see how any self-respecting music fan, or especially female music fan, can listen to the Insane Clown Posse. It was that whole you-can't-have-it-it's-MINE music greed. Part of it is because I also fail to see the point of getting a tattoo of a label's logo.  A lot of it is her writing style--the kind where you call yourself ugly  specifically  so someone will contradict/console you, bait-and-switch, and pretentious as all hell in other parts. But what does ANY of that have to do with me? It's not fun, carting around so much hate for a person I've never spoken to and most likely never will. That is, it may be fun at the time, but afterwards it makes me sincerely question the kind of person I am.       So I have decided that I'm going to stop. I don't know what it will take to stop, exactly. Perhaps I will ask for Zen enlightenment for my birthday. I mean, maybe she's deserving of  everyone's  hate--maybe she secretly skins helpless baby bunnies or fucks bouncers to get backstage to fuck the singer.  Maybe not.  The point is I WILL PROBABLY NEVER KNOW. It's getting ugly, this obsessed-ness, and it's no good for me. That much I know.      (P.S. I am fretting over The Girl because I am reasonably positive that I am going to see her at the  urlLink Mike Doughty  show I am attending tonight, and unless I can talk myself down from the state I have frothed myself into by writing this--froth froth froth--there may very well be fisticuffs.       This brings me to the continued question of writing in here. It's so hard to try and consciously be an individual when there's this sea of voices that you're wading through. Maybe fretting about how I'm not an individual makes me pretentious or exactly the same as everyone else. I'm sick of being trendy. I'm sick of trucker hats and listmaking and namedropping and  urlLink the Skirt  and irony and scheudenfraude and being secretly envious of other people's lives. And maybe it's because there's too much goddamn information. Maybe I need a break from it.*                    *It is up to you to discern whether or not I am baiting you here        I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I'm just sick of  me .

                             gutless   sorry for the lack of action this week. i don't really have all that much to say. i have been hiding out and  urlLink watching   urlLink more   urlLink anime . (Biggest. Dork. Ever.)and alternately hating my job and feeling guilty for hating it. and getting used to the new sleeping schedule, still. restless. not sure why. tired. a lot.        i am also having my periodic self-doubt of why i keep a blog and  whether or not anyone actually gives a shit (if a tree falls, etc.) and am i that self-important that i have to minutely record and orate about what i am eating and listening to and isn't-it-just-contributing-to-the-navel-gazing-disease-that-shall-one-day-consume-us-all.       i will say this, though, about the death of ronald reagan: npr, i hardly knew ye.       i shall return when something actually happens.      maybe.

           what you don't have you don't need it now       here is a list of things that made me happy today, the first four of which are food related, because i just ate, having not consumed breakfast (or showered) this morning and had one of those how-the-hell-did-i-manage-to-get-out-the-door-in-ten-minutes mornings:      1. my cold is now in the stage where i can taste things.      2. peanut butter. peanut butter always makes me happy.        3. eating sunflower seeds out of a coffee mug.     4. eating a tomato like an apple.     5. i am going to get more hours at my job, which, while terrible, was kind of pleasant today (this does not mean that i am not going to snap up the next thing that comes along, though).       6. my sister called to inform me that she has the modest mouse ticket which will be my birthday present, which means that i can talk about how great this show is going to be. the walkmen and broken social scene are opening up for them. i will be able to die after having seen this show. wait, no, i can't die yet, i haven't touched justin timberlake.      7. [nelson] HAha! [/nelson]     8. it's sunny and springy without a trace of humidity.     9. this quote            "In 1981 I lost my virginity, only to gain it back again on appeal in 1983. You could say that my one saving grace was academics where I excelled, but I did not. And yet now I live in the rarified air of celebrity, of mega stardom. My life a series of Hollywood orgies and Kabala center brunches with the cast of Friends. At least that’s what my handlers tell me. I’m actually too valuable to live my own life and spend most of my days in a vegetable crisper to remain fake news anchor fresh."     10. from  urlLink this speech      11. given by this man:                   .       matthew, it's okay if i marry him, right? platonically? i swear, it'll be purely platonic.      12. speaking of the Boy, it will be a year as of tomorrow, not that i want to make too huge a deal out of it, because i did last time, but goddamn, this is the longest either of us has ever been in a relationship. and i repeat, and you can interpret this any way you like: godDAMN.      13. and we are going to IKEA tomorrow. and that makes me happy. and completely predictable.      14. number 2 in the summer oprah is scary whatever i forgot what i called it last time book club:  urlLink the sleeping father . that is still making me happy even though i finished it yesterday.     15. thinking about how yesterday  urlLink the princess  stopped over unannounced after i'd spend the entire day in bed and unwashed and she went and got me some excellent strong tea after she saw how sick i was. aw.     16.  urlLink this kid's  Sexed-Up Dance Party, which i have been informed that i am attending tonight. i am not so sure how well gimps with colds do at Sexed-Up Dance Parties, but we'll see. i can always threaten to overdose on dayquil if someone tries to make me dance to lil' jon.       that's a lot of happy things.      go ahead and contribute your own lists. please.      and happy weekend, y'all.       soundtrack: and you will know us by the trail of dead, "how near, how far"       (end.)

       and i suppose your guess is more or less as bad as mine                         as predicted, it is less than a week after i started working again and i cannot stand my job. mostly because i have been scheduled for  twelve hours a week  after i was under the impression that i was going to get at least twenty-five (and not being happy about any of it because i had been led to believe that this was, you know, a Job) but also and not limited to the fact that the people i work for have so far repeatedly called me sharon, made me remove my shoes in the workplace, listened to lite-jazz, made me type up extensive handwritten notes about conditions of restrooms that my employer consults about the cleanliness of (!) and made me redo one of the Ugliest Fliers I Have Ever Seen In My Life. none of this is what was described to me. i would say "hey, at least i'm complaining about a job that pays me," but alas, it is not a job that pays me. because i work for twelve hours a week. that barely covers the cost of my damn bus pass. and according to my employer there's room for more hours but not anytime this month. i feel betrayed.      the good news: the library clerk position is still open and they want to interview me tomorrow. everything's not lost.     not that i had plans for memorial day, but it pretty much rained the entire time i was in madison. here is a list of things that were accomplished, as i suspect the fact that i keep putting lists in paragraph form is making your eyes hurt. 1. i drank boxed wine for the first time ever and will no longer joke to Boy about wanting to get it. 2. ate food to the point where i think my family members suspect i have a tapeworm. this always seems to happen when i am at home. 3. reread  urlLink this  for the three bajillionth time.          *informal poll time: all the boys who have read  urlLink that  please raise your hand in the form of leaving a comment. when i was at the bookstore we would keep running tallies of how many men vs. women purchased it and i want to know if i am still right, meaning i determined no man would ever read that ever for fear that he would be summarily parted from his testicles. which is a shame, because it's a damn fine book. and if you are a boy who has not read it, please tell me why. thank you.*    4. met up with my friend from high school for coffee where we discussed capital-e-Everything, making me really glad that i haven't grown completely apart from the people i knew in my younger, dorkier incarnations.  5. tried on high heels with my sister--and i mean really grotesque, awful ones--at boston store. came away from the experience with two pairs of sensible shoes and a secret longing to actually be able to wear shoes that stunt your growth, destroy your feet and make your legs look Really Good. also got called out by aforementioned sister in public for noting that i liked a thong we were looking at. to save face, backtracked and pretended i was joking. felt fourteen years old.      all in all, a good time was had.  and tonight i face the heretofore unhurdled relationship hurdle of going to The Gym with Boy, and even though it is nearly a year now, i still have qualms about him seeing me when my face is the color of a tomato.        soundtrack. replacements,  all shook down        end.
