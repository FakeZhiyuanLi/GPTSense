      I love gossip.....I love knowing what people are doing and why they are doing it.  I am not intellectual, not particularly quick witted (I have my moments)and feel no shame about my sex life (unless my mother reads this) but oh how I do love drama.  I love other people's drama, how they relate, how they feel about certain issues in their life....what experiences shaped them into what they are now...who they fucked and was it any good?  Sadly, bottom line....it's all gossip. And not only do I love hearing it...I love talking about it.  So if you are a good friend of mine, you will hear dirt about people you could really care less about and just put up with cause you realized long ago it fascinates me.  And my running of the mouth has never hurt anyone...until today. I did something today that I shouldn't have done, I ran my mouth and then tried to cover up.  While I didn't repeat anything, I alluded to something that wasn't there (as a possibility for an action).....but I am most ashamed of my trying to cover it up.  I wanted to come clean, but at the same time I didn't want anyone mad at me.  Well, it all comes out in the wash they say and the truth did....but not by me.  And that bothers me...I wasn't the one to come clean and I should have been.  The injured party forgave me and doesn't read my blog...but I talk about what other people do to piss me off, so I should write about what I did that was fucked up.  I hate that I did this....but as long as I learn from it and not let it happen again, that's the important thing...and I learned that while I will always love to hear the latest drama, I don't have to dishonor myself in the process.  They may have forgiven me, but I have yet to forgive myself.

      Right now, I so want a cigarette.....yeah, I should quit...but there are moments where ya just need it.  Like in traffic for example....I love to smoke in traffic...or at a bar...or at my local coffee shop....man, I smoke a ton.  But after great sex, it doesn't feel complete until I smoke that cigarette.  Sure, you're glowing, sure you don't really want to move....it just helps you savor the moment...you inhale....and slowly exhale...cause you never smoke that cigarette quickly.  It helps you bask in the glory of what just happened...and lord knows you don't even have to like the guy....you just have to like the sex.  Picture it....your body's tingling all over, recovering from that great coming together that is like nothing a vibrator can compare to....and the only thing that finishes that moment is the cigarette.  How can I quit when there are so many cigarettes to be smoked like that?  You just feel this massive release from every part of your body and to celebrate....you light one up, and it feels so good.  I have great respect for those who quit.....cause right now I'm not gonna.

      Okay, so here I am sitting at home when the phone rings....."Hello, Miss Macy? This is John." (not a real name but an example of a very common name that we all know at least 10 of these guys with the same name....)And I have no idea which "John" this is.....so I politely as possible say, "I'm sorry, which John is this...." So he says "the best looking John you know." So I tell him, "sorry, but all the John's I know are good looking.." Props to me for staying on the safe side, right????  Nope!  To my horror....he says "the only John you took home from *****(random hangout spot)."  Why my horror? Uh.....cause I still had no idea who this guy was!!! He realizes at this point that I have no idea who he is talking about.....and gets offended....I try to cover saying....as soon as I figure out who you are, I am so going to be all like...of course it's you John!!"  Then he starts to tell me about himself to help remind me who he is....and sure as shit....of course I know who he is.....AND in my defense...he moved away...so I thought I'd never see him again.  Should that be props to me for having a man call me across the United States cause of one night?? Yeah....definitely props to me.  Sadly, the damage was done...not even my "you know, you ARE the best looking John I know" could help save the situation.  He was making comments about the girls in the state he was in and how he was just picky..and made a comment that apparently I wasn't...which is so not true....he is pretty hot and that is the reason I didn't really try the whole "relationship - getting to know you bullshit".  So I said, "You got A LOT of ass that month, I am impressed you remembered MY name." Then he said...."Well, it was on your business card"...(for my candle business thank you very much).  And another sad thing about me not remembering this guy.....is he was the last one night stand I had....as in the very last guy...of course it was only a couple of weeks ago....and I had no idea he would ever call me, but me forgetting his name makes me feel kinda slutty....of course, if I was a guy...I'd be cool as hell...and how many girls has this guy forgotten?  Man, you forget a name and wow....that makes you feel bad, at least I remembered WHO he was....who cares about a name...  He should've just said it was the hot bald guy....I'd remember that...besides, I could've sworn his name was Josh...

      One of my true pleasures in life is fighting with my grandmother.  Now, I realize that statement must be shocking, but she is truly evil.  My grandmother is from the East Coast and I live on the West. That doesn't make her evil, but it does show that there are many miles between us and since she's afraid to fly, I hardly knew the woman growing up.  When my mother and father split almost 22 years ago, my father stayed with his mother.  He is still there.  I went to visit him and my visit threatened my grandmother to the point she wrote me a letter accusing me of trying to get in between her and my father...she told how stupid I am not to realize the bonds of mother and son could not be broken no matter how hard I tried.  What did I do to deserve an accusation of that nature?? My father and I had made plans that conflicted with my grandmother's schedule, and my father had to pick between his daughter and his mother.....well, needless to say his decision was made and it took me five years before I visited him again.  The last trip I made out there was a month ago.  I was looking forward to seeing New York or Mystic, CT....and since I was in CT, I figured....cool....sadly, any excursions my father and I could make interferred with my grandmother's lunching...so I really didn't go anywhere besides the small town they lived in.  In today's fight with my Evil Grandmother....it started because she doesn't support my candle business.  She wants me to sell Real Estate.  I have no desire whatsoever to sell real estate, but that doesn't matter to her....candles are nothing. So she insults my business...and I go off.  I was angry....she's the type of person who if you say you like something...she says "oh, you got that from our side of the family"....well, guess what..the fact I have my own business doesn't come from her side of the family....anywhoo, I digress.  I simply told her that it was unacceptable for her to insult my business and if the roles were reversed, she'd never allow anyone to insult her business.  Then she started blaming my mother for the reason I "hated" her.  I told her it's not my mother's fault and that she should look in a mirror if she wanted to see the reason we did not get along.  I still couldn't admit to her that I hated her.  And I do hate her.  I hate her for bad mouthing my family, but mostly I hate her for ruining my father.  My father has no life..the only thing he does that's really his anymore is listen to his pastor's speeches.....which is unacceptable to my grandmother that she has a "holy roller" in the family and that the teachings from the bible are "bullshit"...now I am not Christian myself...but I know the only reason she says that is to try to break him more...  But he is broken.  He rarely goes against what she says...and at 55 years old...people in his town think he is gay.  But the truth is he can't find a woman who will go against her....he wanted me to live with them....not so he could have a relationship with his daughter...but so I could take over his life with his mother.  He admitted that he wanted me to take over his place so he could move.  I guess it's just easier hating my grandmother than hating my father.

      I had something to say, but of course as soon as I sat down to say it....nevermind.  I want to be funny and witty, but if I do make you laugh....I am sure it will be by accident.  I was reading Isabella Wunder's blog....man, that girl is funny.  So I am not going to try right now. If you wanna laugh, read hers....  So here I am after almost four months of unemployment, not wanting to go back to work anytime soon.  I think I need to make a change in my career.  I want a career that moves me.  I had a job....and a paycheck...but it didn't move me.  There's a saying I once read...."Sometimes the devil doesn't buy your soul, sometimes he just rents the space."  Well, I took back my soul from the unfortunate former place of employment and man, I don't want to go back.  I have a home based business selling candles...and they are awesome candles...in fact, I should be working on it now.  I have a big show this weekend....and maybe four people are coming...but I am having it with a makeup consultant...and she's having a lot more people coming than I am.  I go to these leader meetings and man, you'd think I am spreading the word of god.  Sure, this is an awesome company to work for, but I don't feel that I am "obligated" to tell everyone I meet....okay, I am a sucky consultant.  So I named this about my bliss and I have yet to comment on anything blissful.  You know what is blissful to me? Besides, great sex....that's a given.  Having down on First Street in Benicia with some good friends and some great laughter.  That's what I did last night....and it was awesome.

      I answered my phone the other day to speak to someone I haven't spoken to in a long while. I was asked, "What are you doing Friday?" Thinking I was going to be invited to something really cool, I said "Nothing."  "Oh good, you can come to our baby shower." It's for their second baby.  Traditionally, a baby shower was for the first baby only. Nowadays, people can do what they want, but that is still a hazy issue. I looked up an article that talks about the pros and cons about a  urlLink second baby shower . In which they say that every baby deserves a party. So, I am willing to admit that my views were outdated and the shower idea wasn't tacky after all.  Until I received the invitation (via e-mail), which after the date and time said "After the presents, anyone who would like to stick around and watch movies or hang out is welcome."  Excuse me? Isn't that the point of being invited to a party is to hang out? I know that for the expectant parents, it's the gifts, but do you really have to rub my nose in the fact that all you want from me is my  gift to your baby  and that my presence is not really required?? Maybe they should tell people there will be collection boxes on the sidewalk, so that way if you don't want to even stop your car, that's okay.  I just know somewhere Miss Manners is screaming. If you are planning a party for someone, do us all a favor and brush up on your etiquette.

      I wrote a post a few hours ago expressing my anger towards someone I dislike & his "secret" relationship with a much younger girl. She is waiting for him to "announce" their love, and he is telling everyone he is moving slow w/a new girl who is his own age. I was livid at the time and wanted to vent.  I broke my post down with point by point evidence that supports my claim that they are dating each other. But I deleted it....  I deleted it because while there were no names & places mentioned, it was so obvious who I was talking about, and while I really disagree with what he is doing and find it repulsive, I like the girl and would hate for her to be humiliated if she found out what I wrote and the truth about their relationship. She's really happy with him.  He's a Rat Bastard and all shall be revealed....but not by me.

      People find my views on sex interesting....actually, I really have no views on sex. Do whatever you want as long as it's consentual, legal, and you both enjoy it. I think what throws people are my views on men.   Let me start by saying there are exceptions to everything. I know some really great guys who don't fit in my views...of course I can count them on one hand..but they are out there. Also, these are my views and no matter what view you have, if it's different from mine, I don't really care what you have to say, so don't bother posting that I am a fucked up slut. I don't care what people think of me...I've been thought of as Miss Innocence, the Slut, the Fat Cow, the Fat Bitch, the Cool Chick...what have you..but I am me and I am so tired of hiding.  I don't respect men because they hurt women to fuck them. When I want to fuck a guy, I spell it out...no strings attached, blah, blah. When men want to fuck a girl, he seduces her....many times making her believe he cares for her and that he wants a relationship, when in fact, he only wants a piece of ass. AND he will continue to use her, treating her like she matters when she doesn't. She ends up hurt and he moves on.  Men think if they fuck a lot of girls, they are a stud....we know where this is going. That's why I don't tell people my number...men care so much about the "NUMBER", which is really stupid....becuase it's not how many, it's what you did that makes you experienced.  I am so tired of watching men break women's hearts...and sure it happens the other way around, but women are much more giving and men are much more into receiving.  Call it lack of postive male role models as a child, whatever, but I see men as arrogant, holier-than-thou assholes who place more importance on their dick and what it brings to them than on who they are. If all a man can bring to a conversation is how big his dick is and where it's gone, that's really not bringing much to a conversation. It's not saying anything about who they are as a person, but for them, it says so much.  Men have feelings, but for most of them, it's just one feeling and it's in their pants. I like fucking them, and I enjoy my friendship with a couple of them (keep getting burned by my guy friends), but I don't want a relationship with any of them...and funny enough, I use men for sex, but I am open about to the guy and guess what, I don't hurt them.  I normally don't feel this annoyance for men in general, but I so miss being with a woman that I am upset right now that this is all I have to work with.

      I had a fantastic nite last nite. I went to a  non-local  bar, (I know that's crazy) and hung with some friends...but Isabella and I left early cause basically, we just had some bs to deal with. I was just feeling so down in the dumps...we decided to stop by our normal hang-out and we run into Ember 2 Fire and her beau, Material Girl, and a guy I'll call Cowboy....but the mood was still a downer to me....we closed the bar and sat on the steps for hours...one-by-one all leaving until it was only Isabella, Ember and I.  We had some major opening up, awesome conversations.  There I was, a strong woman, sitting with two other strong women...and after being friends with only guys for so long, it felt great to open up to these ladies. And they were so welcoming to me...I realized that I can be vulnerable with them, and I am never vulnerable to people.  I am so enjoying having women friends again...it's been a long time.   The other thing I am enjoying is after posting my "Redemption for a Broken Heart", and never thinking I'll experience a deep connection ever again, I hung out with a really awesome chick.  We are supposed to hang out again just her and I, but I have no idea if she's interested in pursuing anything with me.  Most of my friends have the same mentality as I do....the more the merrier. When I hung out with this girl, you could tell she was hanging out just to hang with me. We checked out various locations to see what was going on, and I was just enjoying spending time with her. She makes me laugh and I think that's great.  As with most of my new friends, I don't know her very well and am trying to get to know her better, but should I say something to her or just see where the friendship develops? I am so horrible at making the first move with a woman that I don't do anything....but she's an awesome girl, so no matter where this leads, it's gonna be cool.

      I sit down at the computer, ready to update my blog, and I say to myself, "Who can I talk some smack about today?" And the answer is no one. I can't gossip about anyone anymore....I've already beat the dead horse about my arch-nemisis and former best friend. But the  REAL  reason I don't have anymore smack is cause I hang out w/my fellow bloggers...and they  read  my blog. (Although, you wouldn't know it from the lack of comments, now I know how Isabella feels)  Oh but I could talk smack....and taking a page out of Isabella's book:  I know a girl, who most unwisely, got a little carried away with the alchohol and tried to spar with a guy known for not knowing his own strength...the result?  urlLink She broke 7 bones in two of her toes.    And I have a new friend who plays a mean game of pool (he beats me all the time) and he also can get the toys out of those machines 9 times out of 10. His gossip: he claims to "hate people",  urlLink but is socializing every nite .  Okay, so I don't have much dirt on him...yet.  And there is another girl who has a beautiful son, is beautiful herself, and helps me figure out my budget. She's gonna be moving in  urlLink with her boyfriend soon ......okay, so there's another one I don't have dirt on.  I don't know this next guy to well yet...and even though he's always very nice to me,  urlLink I don't think he likes me very much . I hardly ever hang out with him though, so I dunno.  This next girl is  urlLink super sweet  and I am just getting to know her.  This next guy and I were rumored to be sleeping together, but that rumor is totally false....although the more alchohol this guy has,  urlLink the more he seems to like me ...hehe  This girl I hardly know, but notice how none of the bloggers are ever mentioned in her blog.... urlLink she just talks about her party friends , well, some of us are at those parties too!  My last fellow blogger.....oh my darling... urlLink is the one I drove to the ER ....and she did appreciate it after all.  See, I have lost the talent for gossip!! I have nothing on these people and if I do, I have lost the desire to spread it.  Where's my bitterness? Where's my forked tongue? I started out so well...why have I mellowed? Why did I have to become a happier person? It ruined my writer's edge.   Oh the humanity of it!  Or maybe I just need a fling....maybe that would help....

      So I was looking to hook up tonight.  The monogamy I was so worried I caught seems to have passed.  I now want a cheap thrill with a new guy.  I met one today who seemed perfect....good looking and hard up.  Perfect...it's so much easier trying to pick up a guy who's hard up, the work's already done.  From there it's just semantics.  Alas, it was not to happen tonight.  I leaned over and flat out told him if he wanted to hook up, just let me know.  The boy couldn't shake his head fast enough, however, he was giving his friend a ride and tonight was not going to happen.  Damn.  But we exchanged numbers, so all was good.  His ass is as good as mine.  I did something very important this weekend.  I took a test that if I pass means I can start substituting full time in the fall.  If I don't pass, I need to find a job for the next year.    I am going back to school for my Master's and Teaching credential in two weeks.  I never thought I would pursue anything further than my AA, but life has a funny way of working out.  I certainly never pictured myself having a bachelor's Degree, but I have one so yay me.  Although I don't make a big deal about it, I love school and learning new things so I am so excited about this new phase in my life.  My first assignment is to write an essay on why I want to be a teacher.  No problem there.  It's funny to think of my life and that one day I will be a teacher. My teachers seemed to be perfect angels and I never thought much about their personal lives. I never thought there might be anything more to them as there is certainly more to me than meets the eye. I mean, what if my elementary teachers went out hunting for dick? That's a gross thought since most of my teachers seemed ancient.  Actually, I wasn't feeling 100% tonight and while a cheap thrill would have been good for the soul, I think it was best that nothing but an exchange of numbers took place. Still, the majority of me wishes it was an exchange of something else.  Hopefully, tomorrow will work out.  So it looks like it's just me and my "back massager" tonight.

      In recent posts, I announced that I hate my best friend's girlfriend.  Let me give you some background: I met this guy a year ago and we hooked up.  I got a kick out his personality and even though he would piss me off, we got along great.  He was 19 at the time and I was 26.  Yes, quite an age gap, but I was doing nothing illegal so I didn't care.  Soon the sex stopped and we remained friends.   A real turning point in our friendship came when he had a drunken three-some with two 16 year olds.  One of them got pregnant.  My friend, "Leo", was torn and scared to death.  The girls told anyone who would listen all about the encounter and of the pregnancy....and the people's reaction as you can imagine was not favorable towards Leo.  Not being one to judge....although I did point out his lack of sound judgment in that affair...Leo came to me with his concerns.  16 year olds being 16 year olds, the two girls thought Leo should behave like he was a boyfriend to the girl.  And he did.  He stayed with the girl and when she took the pills for the medical abortion, she was at his house.  When some strong cramping came on, he called me and I came over....although I think they just felt better having an adult there.  Leo soon started to fall for this girl, and despite the fact I really didn't like her as a person, I would try to be nice to her.  I found the 11 year age gap between her and myself very difficult to handle...she's rude, bitchy, and she has an abnormally large forehead.  I asked Leo if she's ever happy and he told me that was rare.  Leo was quite the playboy when I met him and I hoped when he did settle down, it would be with this amazing girl that no one could blame him for staying with.  Since she's really not that pleasant and generally not a fun person, I began to suspect that Leo's reasons for staying with her were maybe more out of guilt than of feelings.  She soon started telling him that my presence made her jealous.  I had been allowing him to practice driving using my car and she felt that time we spent together was really doing other things.  I can no longer hang out with my friend.  If we want to hang out, we'd have to sneak around.  Yes, we used to fuck, but he's only my friend.  I am tired of having a 16 year old dictate how I hang with my friend.  When all your excuses for someone's behavior is "oh well, it's her age" then guess what, she's too young to be in a relationship.  So hat's off to you "16 year old".....I'm out of the picture.  **Leo had asked me to write about his story to see what other people thought.  I was going to wait but since she pissed me off and this seems to be the end of my friendship with him, (and that hurts greatly) I decided to do it.  So I didn't repeat terribly personal information without consent.**

      Recently, I had to defend my bi-sexuality to a friend claimed since I haven't been with any women since he's known me...I am not really bi.  That comment shook me.  While I refuse to believe there is a time limit for one's sexuality, he's quite right...I haven't been with a woman in a very long time.  Many people have tried talking to me about why I don't date men and have flings.  I don't open myself up to men...I save that for women.  Six years ago (it seems ages ago) my best friend was "Luna".  Luna and I were always hanging out and laughing...it didn't matter what we were doing..we were always laughing.  Luna and I had a connection that was beyond best friends...I loved her like no other...we were friends and lovers.  We both had boyfriends and aside from work and spending time with them, we were inseparable.  People tell me what they did on their 21st birthdays and I rarely share mine....I had a three-some with my boyfriend and Luna....we drank champagne off each other...it was the best.  Luna soon broke up with her boyfriend and quickly found another.  She didn't have as much time for me, but I figured as soon as the "newness" wore off, she'd be back and we'd be just as closer as ever.  Except that never happened...Luna's new boyfriend introduced her to drugs and once she started to change and lie to me...we drifted apart.  I miss her.....I miss feeling that close to another woman.  I miss having a best friend to hang out with and watch chick flicks all night.  I miss feeling a woman's lips against my own....I miss making love.  I only fuck men....I only make love to women.  I miss calling someone up in tears who doesn't try to "solve the problem", she just listens and tries to make me feel better.  I miss someone calling me up in tears and the only thing I want to do is hold her and make the pain stop.  I miss needing my best friend and her needing me back, just as much.  I am scared that I will never feel that closeness again.  I loved Luna, but it was a tender love that was very different than a lustful or even romantic love.  I haven't really pursued any relationships with women....in fact, up until a few months ago I didn't even have any friends that were women.  I love men....I love the whole physical thing with them, and there is a man out there who has claimed my heart....but there's a part left vacant that is not meant for a man...and that part's still a bit broken.

      Ever since I took someone to the emergency room, apparently word got out that I am some kind of taxi service....I was asked if I had ordered a drink and when I replied "no, just a soda" I got to hear "great....you can drive us to another bar cause we want to mess with them after firing a friend of ours."  I wanted to say "I'm not your fucking taxi....kiss my ass you crunt (crusty c***)" but instead I say "Oh, you meant have I been drinking? Oh yeah....I just now stopped....that's why I ordered a soda."  I let someone crash at my house one night.  So the next time she came over she announced that she needed a place to crash and she was just going to crash at my place.  I don't mind extending the offer, but let me extend it.  There's this guy who I will call TW. TW always makes fun of this one guy for having a small dick.  The guy has been with several women who all verified that the guy is abnormally small....so every time TW sees this guy, he does the pinky wave and will actually point him out in the street and "enlighten" any person who doesn't already know about the guy's small dick.  Well, TW told the wrong girl.  Cause she thought it was quite tasteless for TW to make such a big deal about this guy's small dick.  And later on that night after quite a lot of drinks, she found it even more tasteless....she made a point to inform me that TW wasn't that much bigger if at all bigger.  That's right, TW stands for Tinky Winky.  She also says that TW thought she kept having orgasm's because she was moaning....and when she really did have one, he had no idea.  Overall, she says he's not very good in bed.  Which kills me that I know all of this...normally, I could care less how a man is shaped, but I am so sick of hearing TW make fun of the other guy and hear him brag to women how gentle he is and how good sex is about listening to the woman.  Does he think being gentle means you keep sliding out?  And if he is confused by moaning...what is he listening for?  The moral of the story is don't make fun of others for a trait that you have.  Don't point out people in a crowd for strangers to know about his "problem." And don't fuck them later and expose yourself for what you really are....cause women talk. And don't go on and on about being good in bed....know what? It's much better to surprise a woman with your skills anyhow.   There are stupid wankers in the world....but there can be a silent justice too.  Man, I wish I could tell him that I know.

      Sadly to say, Miss Macy is down in the dumps today and has been for the last couple of days.  No real reason....so instead of my normal "this happened and now I am pissed", I am going to tell you about a dream I had last night.....  I don't remember how it started....but I was in my apartment which I believe was in Philly and the love of my life was on his way over but right outside my apartment, he ran into a girl we both knew.....and started talking bad about me.  Very bad.  So I sneak out the back and start to run away....thinking "he'll be sorry now".  I pause only for a moment to take off my sandals and continue to run....I run down a mountain road that turns into a deserted street that looks like Oakland, then I run through a garden, careful to step on the garden stones that create a path...and every new place I run is a new state....so somehow I run from Philly to Mississippi.  I end up at a salon in Mississppi where I decide on getting a pedicure, I want a massage, but don't have the money...there are lots of patrons around me, none of whom seem happy or restful....just all impatient and angry.  I am one of the few who seem calm.   I don't seem to be very tired from my long run that seemed to take seconds, but I am thirsty.  I walk over to a table that has water, but as I pour it turns into Iced Tea...I start pouring Splenda into my ice tea, when a man asks me to pour him some...he thought it was bizarre how I specifically wanted Splenda....I don't really pay attention to him so I drink and drink this Iced Tea and it tastes really good.  I was then interrupted by the workers of the Salon saying I had a phone call...."  Isabella Wunder  " was on the phone....(yep, her blog name) but since now all of a sudden she was the girl my love was bashing me with, I didn't want to talk to her.  Soon, my love calls the salon, telling them he was coming to pick me up...I then thought to myself..."I must come here a lot if everyone knows where to find me."  They come over to tell me that he's coming to get me and hand me a fax Isabella sent over apologizing for her involvement in my running away.  Then I am distracted by a woman who signed up for all these treatments and just left cause her plane was leaving.....then I woke up.

      I am worried that I am starting to feel that sex is better when it's monogamous...I hope it's just a phase.  When taking someone to the ER, it doesn't mean that person is going to appreciate it.  When taking someone to the ER, the attention should be on the one who's in the hospital.  To people who break up...she called you because she needed you and you came...stop playing that you guys don't have feelings for each other...why else call and why else show up?  We only have one body and it has to last....wrap up your shit and if you notice something is not right, get it checked out...otherwise it might leave you damaged for life.  I love my family and we all have a pretty cool relationship....I am not going to tell my mother something in hopes that she tells my brother in hopes that he tells his friend something....sorry, but no.  I am not going to take advantage of the fact my brother and I hang out in with the same people...My family is not going to be the instrument of drama.  I can't wait to become a teacher.  Why is it when you burn any part of skin, someone always tells you that you should have worn sunscreen....If I hadn't worn any sunscreen -  ALL OF ME WOULD BE BURNED INSTEAD OF JUST MY SHOULDERS.  I just missed a spot.  My best friend from high school is planning on having a baby soon.....she thinks my life is bizarre and pointless...she's married to a man she hardly gets along with and now she wants to have a baby w/him.....great.  Pain killers and drinking are a huge no-no.  I shot a pretty damn good game of pool w/Isabella....She won, but I was pretty pleased w/myself.  Friends often have access to an arsenal of weapons they can say to hurt each other...but a real friend doesn't use any of those weapons.    People give me shit for not confronting people, but I see nothing to be gained in really going off on someone...just cause I know how fucked up you are doesn't mean you'll change if I say it.  And it won't make me feel any better to say it.

      I had a blast this weekend w/my fellow bloggers, other friends, and family....but I kept seeing people who chap my hide. So it is to these people I leave my comments with...  To my arch nemesis: I hate that everyone thinks you are so fabulous, yet I have seen into the depths of your soul and it is vile.  To the person who I thought was my friend, but twisted my words to serve his purpose: Don't ever do anything on "my behalf" again...I didn't ask you to and now you look like an ass.  To the person who told another my deepest secret: I only call you when I am drunk and we only hang out when you show up at wolves....what does that tell you?  To my best friend's girlfriend: I hate you but I can't tell my friend...good thing he doesn't have the internet.  To the girl I hated 10 years ago in high school: I still hate you...some may call it "obsessive", however I look at it as "well deserved" hatred.  Sure I can't remember why I hate you...but I do and I am sure your fat ass deserves it.  Ahhhhhh, that's a relief to get that out of my system....now I too can write about how great my friends are...and trust me...they are.

       is the color of my whip.....actually, it's called a flogger. It has a large leather handle with 30 strands of black & purple.      I was disappointed that it didn't hurt. I felt only the weight of the leather straps. But then Storm Rider (who bought me the whip) thinking quickly cut eight of the straps at an angle so they'd deliver the sharp pain I was so looking forward to.    I keep my whip hidden and only use it with Storm Rider, who has repeatedly proven himself the only man I'd trust to tie me up, role play, and whip me.      God Damn! If I ever wrote all of Storm Rider's &amp; Miss Macy's sexual exploits, you'd all be discovering the joys of masturbation.

       I read that women are still ashamed to admit they masturbate. Since I think that's a shame, I decided to make a list of the pros of masturbating. I know, I know, I am preaching to the choir....ah well, feel free to add to this list (that goes for gents as well).     &nbsp;   * It's safe - you won't catch any STDs or get pregnant     &nbsp;   * There's so many ways to pleasure yourself: fingers, back massagers, vibrators, dildos, shower heads, hot tub jets......     &nbsp;   * It's free - you can always use what God gave you....your fingers & for peeps like me, my vibe was a gift (that keeps on givin')     &nbsp;   * You don't have to shave your legs beforehand (or any other parts)     &nbsp;   * It relieves tension     &nbsp;   * My vibrator never: hurts my feelings, leaves me disappointed, holds any judgements, care if I've&nbsp;gained a couple of pounds or if I've showered yet, but most importantly, it never breaks my heart.    * It's refreshing and  feels  good     &nbsp;

       was heard among thuds and crashes coming from the men's room bathroom last night. The occasion was a buddy's birthday & a mutual unnamed friend followed the birthday boy into the bathroom after chasing him around the pool table, apparently to give the birthday boy his real birthday "spankings".     &nbsp;   Okay, so it was for comedic purposes only. The birthday boy emerge unscathed and with no apparent limp showing.     &nbsp;   Ahhh, but there was an uncomfortable limp that reminded me of such happenings...but this was explained as a "stubbed toe." Odd, how a stubbed toe could bring on the walk of a sore ass. But I jest.     &nbsp;   It was karoke night at the corner of First & H last night. Even those who mocked our vocal exploits were soon to be heard making requests and joining in. Isabella took the credit of the Pied Piper, but I believe our song was the sirens song, bewitching all those who heard it. Some of those people left, pretending to be unaffected by our intoxicating melodies, but we all know the truth.     &nbsp;   I, myself, had to pull myself away....as the night was turning into morning, and my bed with it's soft feather bed and jersey sheets were calling to me. That and the addition of a local Police Officer during our stirring rendition of "Amazing Grace" ended the night's festivities.    &nbsp;  Ahh....the night may fade, but the memory will live on.

       I have been doing a lot of thinking about my past & current friendships, and I have come to the conclusion that the reason I am feeling so much more comfortable w/this new group of friends is because I am more comfortable with myself.     &nbsp;   I am complicated....sometimes I am insecure & other times I feel sexy and alive. As we all do, of course. But I am working on not caring about the little things...     &nbsp;   Do you see that link for my dog, Misty? If you click on that link, then click to see her doggie pals, you'd see over 80 dogs listed to her. Is my dog really that popular? No....I just want to make a statement that she has a lot of friends...does she? No....but if I am going to be doing anything on the web, I want people to see it.     &nbsp;   I started this blog wanting to be witty and sexy...which I have been, but more often I am open and personal. I wanted to write things that would interest other people. The same's true with my second blog....     &nbsp;   But I don't get a whole lot of comments....which bugged me...but yet gave me a lot more freedom. I can write anything I want now & not care. I feel as though I have no more responsibility to what I write. When I wrote about the people who pissed me off, they heard about it....now, who gives a fuck?     &nbsp;   My dog has 80 doggie pals she's never met. I was obsessed with comments...who comments where & what they say. I spent over an hour sending 50+ e-mails to people to see if they'd be friends with my dog. So, now what?    &nbsp;  Geez, why do I care so much? Or do I? I sit at my computer...ready to type...and instead of thinking "What would be interesting for people to read on my blog?" I thought, "What do I want to say today?"

       and then want to stick your dick in her mouth.    &nbsp;   It's just not a good idea. I know that some men view receiving a blow job as a power trip. As in "Oh, look how great I am that I have some girl down on her knees paying homage to my manhood."     &nbsp;   'Cause for me and many other women, the power trip is on the other end. What happens when I stop? Uh oh.....looks like it's Rosy Palm and her 5 sisters for ya now.     &nbsp;   I can make it a so-so experience or I can make your knees shake. I can pretend to be mediocre and (oops)  use my teeth. I can change the rhythm and mess up your concentration. And you know what I am talking about.     Bottom line: Don't piss me off and leave your most&nbsp;vulnerable possession&nbsp;in my hands. (haha)      Men - this&nbsp;holds true&nbsp;for other women. Blow jobs are not the power trip for you, it's really a chance for the lady to show how good she can be to you or how bad.

       Ahhh....and away we go.   &nbsp;  Phase 1 of eating better. I am following the South Beach Diet. Low Carbs, good protein and good fat.....bye bye, breads (although sourdough is okay), croutons (a sad loss), regular soda, fast food, candy, and cupcakes (now I'm sad).  &nbsp;  I know that a lot of people don't agree with dieting, but for someone like myself, I need something strict or it won't work. I have often found that one person's way of losing weight is not the best way for another.  &nbsp;  I need to completely give up my junk food. Oh, the complete sadness. I love hostess cupcakes....yummy. And they make me feel so much better when I am depressed.  &nbsp;  Eventually, I'd like to write a novel about a woman who loses over 100 lbs. And I feel that my blog would be perfect for me to "store" ideas, reminders of feelings....and all that good stuff...  &nbsp;  Or perhaps, I'll start another "blog".

       Medicare has decided that obesity is no longer a "personal failure" but a medical problem.....it's about time....check out these stats:  &nbsp;  60% of American are overweight  30% are obese (those of us with a BMI of 30 or over)  &nbsp;  Doubt my facts? Got 'em   urlLink  here   .  &nbsp;  A BMI is short for Body Mass Index.....it's a number based on your height and weight.&nbsp; A number over 25 is considered overweight.....30 is obese.  &nbsp;  A 40 means you could qualify for a gastric bypass operation....  &nbsp;  At my heaviness, I was a 39.7....now I am a 33.4....and thats after a near 50 lbs decrease.

      Okay people....you really need to think about this...If you view me as slutty, someone who sleeps with anyone, then how can my hitting on you make you special? If I am slutty, then wouldn't that make you just an average joe? Or perhaps do you think that by saying no makes you somehow special? How cute....I'm flattered that you think I am never told no....but wait...you are also someone who said no cause my weight turns you off...and yet you are still special...hmmm.  The male ego never ceases to amaze me.  Guess what? I approach a lot of men. I fuck a lot of men. And a lot of men turn me down. And my approaching you only means that I thought on a whim you'd be entertaining in bed...yeah, it's not cause I had been fantasizing about you in any way...and if I approach you more than once....it's because you never flat out said no. And in my eyes, if there's a debate on the subject, there's a possibility of a yes.  Wanna know what makes a man  special  in Miss Macy's world? If after I fuck you, and I want it again.....then and only then, feel free to allow your ego to take flight, you've earned it.

      I have deleted some posts off my blog....basically, because I am ready to move on from certain events/people in my life and their presence on my blog is not healthy...the really angry posts I wrote are still there....just 'cause I love the fact I actually said those things instead of just thought them.  I've spent the last two days really analyzing my life and what I have valued as important. I people please and search for acceptance...and that needs to not be important anymore.  I value many people in my life, but I still can take some nights off. Do you know that if someone called me to hang out, I would regardless of what I felt or had to get done errand wise? It was as if I was scared that one refused invitation would stop all the rest....and that's silly.  I posted something in the early stages of my blog about someone being gay which turned out not to be true. I think the guy is bi, but not gay. I never looked at his behavior as rejection though...I was bothered that I gave him so many opportunities to say no and he didn't....maybe he thought that was just the "nicer" thing to do...hell, we all make mistakes.  It was easy to dismiss his behavior as being gay since I never saw him really romancing other girls...I just saw the same pattern repeated....until now. He has a romance starting with a friend of mine. I am actually happy for her...I hope he is nothing but great to her because she really deserves that.   But damn her fine ass! Why does she have to be smart and beautiful? Can't she be one or the other? Or a drooling dope? I try not to compare myself to others, with the thinking that there's always going to be someone better & worse, but it's hard to look at someone like her and not be a bit wounded at this point.  I don't want her to hide things from me. I hope things do work out between them. I just tell myself that even if I wasn't overweight, he wouldn't have gone for me....but I guess we shall never know.   The funny thing is when I become skinny again, I am not going to give a damn about what he thinks...I'll only care while this insecurity of mine is here.

      Last night I was once again moved to tears watching Nip/Tuck. If you have not yet seen this show, you have to. Last season was amazing and so far this season is looking to be just as good. Since it's about plastic surgeons in Miami, the scenes can get graphic, but I just block that with my hand. Here's some reasons why I love this show:  The "badboy" Christian is supposed to be a major love 'em & leave 'em, but he's in love with his partner's (Sean) wife AND last season he got a girl pregnant and decided to raise the baby with her. He was totally changing his life and becoming a better person, but when the baby was born, the baby was obviously a different race than either one of the "parents", so Christian decided he loved the baby anyway and is currently trying to get custody.  OMG Christian is hot!  Last season the doctors removed a birth mark off a man's testicle in time for his honeymoon. It's only when Christian is watching the news that he learns the guy was really a priest who was accused of child molesting, but was let off because he didn't have the identifying mark the boys said he had. But Christian makes him pay...and opens up more than we've seen.  The moment that moved me the most was when Sean fell in love with a married patient and cheated on his wife with her. But the woman he fell in love with had advanced breast cancer. Sean helped her commit suicide (even though he was totally against it) and held her hand the whole way through. His wife Julia (who had no idea) asked to go to the funeral with him & Christian. It was at the funeral, seeing how broken up her husband was that she realized about the affair. Julia asked Sean what was it about the dead woman, and Sean replied, "When I look into your eyes, I see regret. And when I looked into hers, I saw hope."  I could go on and on about this show. It airs on Tuesdays on FX. Everyone should watch this show.....it's the best.

      I am staring at a post-it note I wrote the last time I got really drunk at my apartment. I smile when I read it, because we all know those horrible thoughts we think about ourselves as that moment of drunken insight. If you think really well of yourself when you are slammed, then you are lucky. I smile, cause I have to, that post-it note has to be wrong.  I read this post-it note and I realize it says so much about me. We all have a deep rooted fear that we'd hate it if it were true, so we work so hard to make sure that fear never comes true. But in the back of our head, that thought/fear is there.  Really, if that post-it note became the truth, if my fears came to be, I would really be no different than I am now. I move from group to group, my friendships disintegrating. I allow people to treat me horribly and walk all over me. I hope that the group of people I am hanging around with now will be different. They already seem completely different by being as real as they can....that's a good start. My recent friendships have been based on who can impress the most.  This miss-spelled post-it still stares at me. And this post-it has been spewing it's venom long before I put the words in writing. It's how I lived my life, it's the reason why I allowed people to treat me the way I did. This 6 worded sentence has wreaked enough havoc in my life.  So I ripped it off the wall and tore it up. I am finished with it.

      Feeling domestic today, I cleaned my car. Not just cleaned my car out, oh no, I went above and beyond collecting garbage. Except for a spot I missed, I detailed my own car.  Yay me.   Actually, the best thing is that I am a smidge more tan than before I started...that and my car is clean....  and  sooo pretty .  My friend (who's a guy I'll call LoveMan) was bitching at me that my car should be clean.....so, as I am rather impressed with myself, I tell him not only was I up and about before 10 a.m., I also cleaned my car....to which he simply replied "Yeah? Did you make it to the store like you said you were gonna?"  Fucker.

      Oh how I love being a woman!!!  I am re-reading the most  awesome  book, "Kiss My Tiara, How to Rule the World as a Smart Mouth Goddess" by Susan Jane Gilman.  I was lying at home tonight, to tired to go out after a late night weekend, not terribly exciting, just late night...anywhoo, I was sitting at home suffering from being shot right between the eyes...okay so it's a pimple, but damn it hurts, when I picked up this book and started reading.  I read how we women have been killing ourselves to look beautiful to attract men. Lord knows I hate being seen without make-up nowadays. But this chapter spoke about how we will endure pain and suffering to look like models...who are so airbrushed, that they don't even look like their pictures!! Ladies, what are we doing?  The intro spoke about "The Rules." I have read the rules, not knowing what it was about. I actually got out my highliter to highlight the parts that pissed me off...until I realized I was highlighting the whole damn book. Ms Gilman and I are in agreement about "The Rules." BULLSHIT!! And if you have never read the rules, it's guidelines on how to catch yourself a man.  The basic premise is that if you play hard to get and not show even a glimmer of personality, a man will fall in love with you and marry you. And once that blessed day comes and you show emotion/who you are/personality, well, he'll be so in love with you that he won't care....but you shouldn't show your true self, after all, he did save you from spinsterhood, so he deserves to have the perfect woman as a wife...basically, act like a Stepford Wife and you will be a winner.  If you hate that kind of bullshit, then you should really read this book. I quote "Hey you're the one with the pussy. What are you knocking yourself out for? Let 'em get on their knees and beg." If you want more info about this book, click  urlLink here .  This book reminds me how strong we women are, and it's okay for us to think for ourselves...yet still want to shave our legs...it shows us that you can still be a feminist but not give up dick. Bravo!!

      I once had a class with a very cute, over-weight, terribly sweet, & funny girl....and I hated her. I hated her because I realized that I defined myself as the sweet fat girl. I was so afraid of rejection that I would surround myself with a "I'm the sweetest girl you've ever met" aura...all because I wanted to make sure people would look past my heavy body and see something beyond that.  The downfall was that people started treating me like dirt anyways. Sure, they no longer rejected my looks, but they started walking all over me. I knew it and I allowed them to. I cared so much about what people thought about me, that I didn't care how they treated me...as long as they thought me a great person, I didn't care.  As if being fat wasn't hard enough without the whole identity thing....chairs are evil and so is the media....funny that you don't hear Jay Leno making comments about Mary Kate's eating disorder...but if you are fat ~ hell, that's comedy. Anna Nicole won back the hearts of her critics....not by getting smarter or not being a spaced out diva....oh no, she lost weight.  And good for her....she deserves the praise because of the bullshit mockery she got for being fat. It's amazing how you can be so large and people still don't see you...so you make people see you....you become funny and disgustingly sweet, even though inside you rage and hurt.  But the stomping doesn't end...the comments don't stop....you see skinny girls talk about how fat they are, then they look at you as if to say "oh, but it looks good on you."  If you are not a size 16 or over - STOP WITH THE FAT COMMENTS!!    So you completely lose yourself....who you are disappears. You are defined by your sweetness and your size...you are terrified to be angry...who will like you then? So you bury it....put it away...and if you are like me...find your solace in food. Cupcakes are my favorite.  And if you are lucky....like me, you lose 50 lbs....sure, I still have 50 more to lose, but it's not as hopeless as it seemed before. Some of those layers are gone...and a little bit of me shows again.  I get angry...I don't want to be used anymore...but I am so used to burying my feelings. So they have to come out now. My mother told me to stop writing on my blog if I am pissing off to many people...but I write out of anger, anger that I have been denying myself just so everyone will still like me.  I've felt alone before....you feel alone when you are fat....my anger may alienate me..and it may hurt people...and I don't want to hurt people. But how many people really worried about hurting me? I can't deny who I am anymore. Part of me is sweet and funny. But part of me gets angry and bitchy...and until I find a balance...it may get rough and lonely....but as Sammy Davis Jr. sings "I Gotta Be Me."

      I am proud to say my pool game is improving...tonite I made an awesome bank shot. Woohoo!  I got a call from my leader regarding my candle business. I have stopped going to meetings and this has my group worried. They all ask about me and e-mail me to see if I am okay. I am just tired of hearing how I should be spreading the word of my business. I love my business and want to continue to have a show every now & then, but my priorities have changed. I am now going to school to become a teacher. I thought I wanted to move up in my candle biz and recruit people, but I am not a hard salesperson. I want my business to grow, but at a pace I am comfortable with. Basically, I am not one of those people who can talk you into booking a show and trying it out as a career. If you want to, I think that's great. But it's not dependable work, so I think it's a great part-time business with me. Of course, I can't tell that to my leader...she'll take it as me failing.  And I really have no desire to hear her disappointment right now.  I hung out w/Tiny Dancer and her baby (Griffen Jam was there as well). I enjoyed myself so much. I can't wait to have a baby....but first, I need a steady job...I don't plan on getting married, and I think that's fine. I intend for the baby's father to play a role in my child's life, but if not I think there are good male role models in my life that will help with that. But I want a baby before I am 30....2 1/2 years to go. But a lot can happen.  A guy from Wales asked me if I want to go to a movie sometime. How bizarre is that? I am so not used to being asked on dates. He seems pretty nice and going out with someone once doesn't mean I have to date him....I figure we can be friends...isn't it funny that guys can come up to me for sexual propositions and I totally know how to act, but when a guy comes up to me generally wanting to get to know me, I have no idea how to respond and why he's even asking...he told me I was beautiful (which is lovely), he has an accent (which rocks), he's attractive (a plus), a good pool player (shows we have the same interest), and I haven't been out on a date for about 6 months, so I guess why not.....except I don't want to date anyone....ah well.  There is a part of my life that I intend to keep personal, so I will never write about the specifics...but I am deeply in love with a man who I cannot be with. He is my ultimate best friend, a man I turn to for guidance and support, and never leaves me doubting of his love for me....I can't simply pretend he doesn't exist, but from now on, I won't speak of him - but his presence is always there.

       I had fucked this guy a few months ago. His performance was so-so...a bit slower than I'd normally like, but the hottest thing on him was his mouth.       And no, I don't mean him going down on me....I mean the guy would not shut up about me. He was telling me how long he's been wanting to fuck me (he said years), how I turned him on, and how he couldn't believe this was happening....the man was screaming   MY   name!!      I didn't know how real that was, but damn it was hot!! It would be so cool if it was true, but I don't want to know....no guy has ever gone off like that in my life...let me tell you, oh, I felt extremely sexy for the next two weeks. Damn, I'm hot!      Anyways, I knew he was moving to another state...so I figured bon voyage....Until I ran into him again a month ago (he is still moving, but he was really busy & thought I might be mad at him for not calling sooner)....he was buying me drinks and telling me how bummed he was that we had just hooked up &amp; he had to leave. He told me how he just wants to touch me.....kiss me....you name it. I point out that he's not gone yet & we have some time to have fun &amp; when he leaves....no regrets, no strings. He agrees (quite enthusiastically) and so I call him a couple of days later to see if he'd like to hook up.      The fucker never calls me back. Just in case something came up....I gave him one more opportunity.....nope. Well, that happens, no commitments go both ways. Don't take it personally, I didn't want to date the guy &amp; hell, there's plenty more where he came from....plus, I reminded myself that his fucking was only....eh, if it wasn't for his glowing review of me.      I ran into him last night. I'm friendly, civil, but distant when he starts flirting with me. And he is so flirting with me....and even though I drank a wee bit too much, I am still simply friendly.      When I was leaving, he says goodbye, then he says, "You bother me, Miss Macy."       I ask, "I bother you? How's that?"       His line: "You are so cool....you bother me because I am leaving. Why did I have to find out just how cool you are?"       "So, that's why you never called me, cause I am so cool, it bothers you." I think he's really trying to tell me he'll get attached to me....but then again....I dunno.      "Yeah. You are the coolest girl I have met in a really, really long time....and I have to leave, but will you call me before I leave?"      "Sure." Yeah, you hold your breath til I call.      If he was telling the truth....that'd rock. For me anyway.

       Math Miss Macy style:      Drinking too much + karaoke microphone = La Isla Bonita, the Shoop Shoop Song, Blue Moon, Earth Angel, Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend, & Johnny Angel sang out of tune.      Drinking too much + watching pool = yelling comments like "Slam that bitch & show her who's boss!!" "How the fuck did you win that game?" "Do you ever make shots in?" "Yeah baby, you own that fucking table!" "My grandma could have made that shot!"       Drinking too much + hanging out w/my friends = comments like "I love you....no, I really love you." then when they walk away, comments like "I don't really love him.....I was just saying that."      Drinking Red Bull + booze = it's 4 a.m. &amp; I am wide awake. Fuck.

       Ugh!! While entertaining my most favorite of gentlemen callers last night....wait, that sounds like I was having way more fun.....he just walked through the door. He had mentioned he was thirsty on the phone, so I had a nice big glass of cool water waiting....I was alternating between school work & housework, when the fuckwit dared to enlighten me with his opinion as to how I should be cleaning my apartment.      Thinking my dirty look was enough for him to know he crossed a line, we both laid on the bed, where he promptly fell asleep. Not just my lover, but my best friend, I thought this domestic moment in my life was somewhat charming.      When he awoke 10 minutes later, he asked me for a garbage bag. Then he got up and starting gathering my empty bottles for me lecturing me in the process. He seemed surprised that I kicked him out &amp; was even more surprised that I was still mad at him this morning.      Not only did I not get any yesterday.....I sure as hell didn't want any! Rat bastard.

       Thank you to all those who showed concern for my kitty. Except for the bizarre bruising on my hip, I am feeling much better today. And no, I do not drop my links like a used condom: men yes, links no.       Speaking of dropped men, I wrote earlier about my 20 year old best friend who stopped being friends with me because of his 16 year old girlfriend, I appropriately named "The Forehead". My friend & I started out as fuck buddies, but then developed a very strong friendship....Until that child showed up. I was given the opportunity of hiding my friendship with him like he was a married man I could only call during work hours &amp; accept the fact he'd ignore me in public....but I said "fuck that....I am 27, I am not placating a 16 year old." Really, he never should have admitted to anyone that he & I had sex. THIS IS WHY I DON'T TELL PEOPLE WHO MY LOVERS ARE. It always backfires.       Anyways, my "buddy" leaves a message on my machine out of nowhere....turns out he & the Forehead broke up....not only does he want to hang out again (which I'm sure means sex) he is also going for his driving test &amp; his mother is willing to pay me for gas, so her son, my former best friend, can practice driving with my car. I'm gonna pass on all that....yeah, no thanks.       My baby brother came up from UCLA yesterday, so we all went out to dinner: Mom, StepDad, Middle Brother, Middle Brother's Girl, Baby Brother, Me. A couple of things came out of said dinner:       * My mother only needs two margarita's to get drunk & silly &amp; possibly embarrassing    * My baby brother is becoming a slutty lush - as most of his stories involved either drinking or girls or both    * The entire table hates that guy w/the guitar who goes around singing, & is willing to pay to make him leave.    * My middle brother almost got into a fight with some Prince look-a-like at a party cause the guy got had a Batman logo tatoo &amp; kept telling my brother it was just a bat. For some reason, that offended my comic-loving brother.    * My mom doesn't like that my baby brothers phone message is entirely in spanish    * My StepDad likes to talk.....a lot, babble really, but's it comical       Last night I played free pool with Fire Faery, GriffenJam, & Love Lost Libra....when the pool is free, it's really hard to care who wins &amp; loses.....I so didn't care.

       Ugh.....after a massive night of copulation (protected, thank you very much) on Monday night, I am still in pain this Winzday morning. My thighs hurt, my hip flexors hurt, I have a bizarre bruise on my hips, but most importantly....my kitty hurts!!      And it wasn't even any good!! It went entirely too long and I think the fuckwit used up all my lube.....I finally put an end to my torture when I realized there's no way in hell this is going to improve.....      Oh, but he's a champ!! Sure, he didn't come, but he thinks if he can last a long time & wear the girl out, that's more impressive. Doesn't he know that sometimes, we are just thinking "Dear God - hurry up &amp; finish"....how can he not know that sex shouldn't be painful in those ways.....if every couple of minutes the lube has worn away &amp; it's not being replaced naturally, well that's not a good sign!!      And now I am too sore to make it up to my poor kitty!! no vibe, no fingers....and most disappointing....no Storm Rider....sadness, sadness.

      to how moving and important this post is on  urlLink Christopher's Diary  for August 3rd is.  It's so easy to think that nothing bad will happen to you from sex, which is stupid becuase sex is one of the few things I know that can completely change your life in one instant.....sure some of the diseases are curable or at least you can live with: herpes, warts..... and those are the most common STDs.....over 45 million people have herpes & 20 million have warts....check this  urlLink list  of STDs if you don't believe me. And how many woman do I know who have gotten pregnant? I think I am one of the few who hasn't. How many hands have I held during abortions? Too many.  And the worst: HIV, AIDS.... If you think it's just a "gay disease" then you are too fucking stupid to be reading my blog.

      I wrote the poem below over a period of one week. It's a cumulation of my experiences with many people.....so if you read this, and think it's about you.....you're wrong.

       You stand on your soapbox, with your arms open wide, saying "Do not judge me, for I am just as flawed as the rest of you, and I do not judge."  I flocked to your side, like a sheep to her shepard, believing you live by your words, as do I.  You tell of your pain & your demons, the trials of your life. I speak of my lifestyle, the choices I've made, and the pain those choices can often bring.  I trusted you not to judge, a mistake on my part, how quickly you turned, acting like you are better than me.  You spew your opinions, your judgments, your lies. Your pain is not my pain, your demons....not mine.  You project all these feelings onto my life, and proclaim them the truth.  How can you see the truth with vanity, arrogance, &amp; self-importance distorting your view? So, what can you possibly see? Only yourself, cause you can't see me.  Spare me your judgments masked in your distorted "truths". It's all just bullshit.  The truth is now mine, so clearly I see... beauty, truth, & depth can be projected, words can be spoken, yet utter no truth, sometimes we see so much, in those who are transparent.  And what may seem to be bursting with tolerance &amp; support, may simply be hollow....an empty shell.
