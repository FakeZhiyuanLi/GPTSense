         Hello Hello. Well nothing has happen for a while soo yeah. I was thinking about my first luv. I feel like shit just thinking about it. I wanted to cry again. No one ever forgets thier first luv. I mean hopefully that person hasnt for got abotu me. Vuz if they did well...Yeah. There are soo many things I wish I could have done. They gave me their address. And I lost it. I feel soo dum for lossing something that could keep me connected to them. There are soo many things I wish I could have done. Im always in my room trying to think of a good song to write about it. But theres never a good song. And sometimes when I try to forget abotu it I end up finding a song about it. Im always wanting to cry about it. Soo now I hope that I can see this person once again. Cuz I think if we were really meant to be we would see each toher once again. I pray that we do. But I need to stop this thinking before I get real into it. Yeah Im done now. Bye!!XoxO

         Hello Today is such a better day. Well I mean the whole day was a big bore. Something soo funny happen. During 5th period me and my friend Lucy were talking about some friends of ours. Then all of a sudden I heard the word "Fight". So I turn around and I see two guys fighting and beating the shit of of each other like if there was no tommorrow. Then I tell Lucy "Look!" She goes "......Oh shit their fighting." And man for two seconds the teacher goes "Hey! Stop!" Then she jumps in to sperate them and they almost swing at her. And man oh man the teacher pushed them to the floor and kick them out of her class room. WHich they were still fighting. Lol. But yeah. I finally said soory to one of my friends mom, Allie. I got her mom's boyfriend mad. Long story anyways. Thats all I got to say. Bye!!XoxO

But yeah. I hate when people say that cant write a song. I mean no one can but you can write poems and stuff. Some dont like to express thier feelings. Geez whats wrong with it? I do it all the time, and believe me I do. Lol. But yeah. Music needs to stay with you yer whole life. And if you dont listen to music then you smoke crack. J/k. No but you need to listen to all types of music. Not just one. I suggest Liz Phair. AWSOME ASS CHICK! She rocks my wrrrld. But Im mad at her cuz she has this one guitar I like and I wanna kill her.

         OMG! I had a blast today. When I thought that this Spring Break would be  BORING  it became the best just for one day. Me, Lucy, Lucy's lil bro, and Celi went to the movies. It was soo fun. We just laugh and laugh. We threw spitballs at each other. We went to see "Takeing Lives". We were gonna see the "Alamo" but eh! We didnt want to after all. Oh man my friend Celi, a great grrrl to be friends with and to talk to cuz she is funny, she was soo dum. There was a part when the actress was in some room. The actress was leaning against the wall. And Celi goes "Oh man the would be trippy if the doors open." I go "What?! Doors do open" She goes "Oh shit I mean the walls." Funny ass shit....I kept on buggin her about it. Yeah it was fun. And thanx to Lucy for telling me this. If it wasnt for her I would have hung myself because of this  BORING  Spring Break. Yeah some guy named Louie was supossed to go but he didnt go after all. Soo I wanted to meet him. Oh well...Maybe next time. Ugh...okay that was today sooo Yeah! Bye!!XoxO

         Hello Hello. OMG! One of my friends mentioned about Carmen Sandiego and its been in my head for a while now. Hahaha. But seriuosly how can she hide for soo long? I would get mad at her on every episode. They kids would find out her evil polts but they couldnt stop her either way. God damn that whore! She made me mad. I tryed my best at getting her. But I failed. Ugh...But my friend caught her. She has her in the closet. She asking her questions. If Carmen Sandiego doesnt give us the answer we want she earns a slap. Hahaha. That's what Carmen Sandiego gets for hiding all the time and wasting my time looking for her ass. Anyways. Yeah its Spring break and I hate it. I have nothing to do. I sit in my room listening to Bikini Kill or Bratmobile. I cant find my other cds. Which sux by the way. Yeah. Have I mentioned that Im in a band? Well yeah its called Who's 2 Blame? Heres more info on us. We do our original songs. We sometimes cover Bikini Kill and Bratmobile. I play drums. Sometimes I sing. Our vocalist is Allie, 15. Shes great and fun to be around. She cant sing all professonal but she knows how to fucken yell. Our guitarist is Andy, 14. Hes barely learning guitar but hes already good at it. Hes good at playing one string. Thats his specialty.

         Yeah life is annoying. Im not Emo but Im really hurt evryday. Somwtimes I think know one cares anymore. Ugh...But yeah. I hate life but I wish it would get better. Anyways I was watching this show called Degrassi. Its a show about normal kids living life. Its soo kool to watch. Anyways this one episode I was watching, it was about this grrrl against the skool's food. Saying that it was serving bad food. She starts to have a protest against it like 10 yards from the skool. And then later on in the episode the Princial comes telling her to stop the protest. She told him that she has the right to speak her mind. And then he gave her a weeks detention. Later on she does it again, but this time for another reason. She did it again because she was saying that she has the right to speak her mind. And then the Princial comes warning her to stop. He gave her a choice: either apoligize to the whole skool for the "mess" she made or get kick out of the skool. So she went up to the skool and didnt say soory but she told them that she has the right to speak her mind. It was the freedom of speech and if she would get kick out of the skool so then be it. Then in the end she didnt get kick out. But she was warned not to do it again. But I thought that episode was great. Hopefully you can all see it. Its on this channel called The-N. Its kool. Well thats today. Bye! XoxO

         Hello Little World! God...I nvr felt like this before. I thought being single would be the greatest thing ever. I can do whatevr I want. Kiss who evr I want and blah blah blah...But now I just feel like I wanna stay with one person only...But I cant cuz I know Ill be rejected...God I cant believe I said that. But yeah. I like to many people when I know I may nvr get with them or even talk to them. It hurts...Badly...And I feel like shit. And when I find out someone likes me I get all excited. They think im a kool guy but when they met me they change their mind. Its been like that with evryone. So I might as well die...or sleep...either one, I dont care. Lucy...If you are reading this...I think that is why I felt like shit in 5ht....And I might continue feeling like this...But it wont stop me from going to yer house and wetting you and Louie babe. Lol...Well...Im done crying, trying and lying. Bye!! XoxO
