      I'm on my way out the door to try to secure a fun part-time, minimum wage job for the next few weeks- or longer. Someone, somewhere in Onslow County wants to hire me! I just don't know who that is yet.

      So I've got myself this job, yo. I work at a phone/computer center on base. This is the job that's making me realize how valuable that paper is that I'm going to be paying off for the next 20 years. No, this job is just a temp, until I get the call from a school, hiring me. This is just an in-between, help Damon and I get some money, type job.   The teaching job should come through sometime this week. I interviewed for a regular ed position and after my debate, I went with the special ed position. The opportunity for professional development and philosophy's are more aligned with what I have in mind in accomplishing in life. I'm not locked into Special Ed, which was a big factor in the decision. This is a year- not the rest of my life.   I'm very happy that I will soon be on a schedule much similar to Damon's. I want to be there when he leaves and gets home from work. More so than anything, I want to be able to have the weekends with him. I miss the time that we don't have to spend together. On one hand, I think this job is good because we get the extra money; on the other hand, I miss spending time with him. I want to go back to being his fiance more than being some girl that lives with him and is on a completely different schedule.   Off to work I go. Give me a call if you're bored. Free weekend minutes!!!

      So I gots me a job and I work on da base. It's a good job. I work in the phone center: checking people in and out of using phone and computers. It's an easy, easy job. I get to do some wedding planning, read some books- and get paid to do it. I'm okay with that. Today I have to get the save the date cards finished, call parishes again, and finish getting addresses and finalize the guest list. Fun times!!!

      I went home this past week to look for wedding dress styles and bridemaids dresses. It was fairly easy to find the bridesmaid's dresses. I was trying on dresses for style types as well when I happened upon "the dress". Well, it isn't exactly the dress I was expecting to find, even the one I was going to have made. But it is beautiful. No blue though. I am really discontent that there is no blue in it. I think I'm going to beg, cry, throw a temper tantrum, etc., to get a stitch of blue in there somewhere. It's something about the perfect dress for the perfect wedding. I know there is a ton of childish fairytale lore roaming around my thoughts on these things, however, I do believe that the dress I would have designed would have been absolutely beautiful. I have to remember this lesson when I am teaching my students and one of them has a unique idea; I want to foster, encourage and support that student.   Speaking of students, I am now the new 5th grade teacher at Queen's Creek Elementary. I am stoked about this! I was trying on dresses when one principal called me. She wanted to hire me but the numbers wouldn't support another position at the time. If numbers went up, I'd have a job. If not, I would be transferred to any job within the county. Therefore, rather than see me uprooted to another school, she wanted me to be placed in a nearby school. So she recommended me to the principal at QCE. I interviewed, was offered the position and I accepted! I am stoked!!!!

      I just found out that I am not a baptized Catholic. I was baptized Episcapaleon (I don't even know how to spell it.) For my entire life, I grew up believing that I was a Catholic through and through. And now that belief turns out to be a falsity. What's worse is that I don't know if I can wed in a Catholic church now. Because I was not baptized in the Catholic church, I may not be able to get married in the Catholic church. And yet, faced with the choice/decision of getting baptize, I have no doubt in my mind that I would choose Catholic at this point in my life.

      Gosh, there are so many things that have been going on lately in my life. Today, the rollar coaster has taken me to Baltimore, MD, where I am fusing together Damon's life, my life and more of who I am. I was not looking forward to this weekend, but after being here less than 24 hours, I have learned a lot about Damon, his friends and myself. (They are all awesome!) And as I used to do at home, sit and contemplate about my life, past, present and future, I have been having the chance to do it here as well. I like this times that I can reflect on who I am and define myself more productively.   There are times in my life like this weekend where I can really see the distinction of who I was, who I am and who I want to be.  Who I was: growing up in a broken household, no trust or honesty, fending for myself, on the defense. Getting what I worked for and nothing more.   Who I am: Learning to trust and be more honest. Loving the experiences that comes my way. FingTB. You know that sort-of laid back kind of lifestyle. The trust in friends and life will be okay.   Who I want to be: I don't know. I know that I shouldn't have a deasset clue about who that person is. I want to learn to be open and honest and trusting.   Babble, babble, balle.   I have to go get ready for the wedding.
