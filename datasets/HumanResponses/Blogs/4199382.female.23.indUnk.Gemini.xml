       Hi All...trying to write the music for this song...help??       Believing, Receiving    The burning inside,    Learning and Yearning for greater light,    Melting the frost,    Moving the lost.       Through the winds of change,    Encircled by the clouds of pain,    I guard it with my life,    I need the warmth,    I need the light.       Though the storm may rage,    I stand against the pounding rain,    I remain, A keeper of the flame.       Also...if anyone is interested check out a book call the Radiant Heart by Dr. Sharon J. Wendt...just started reading it...fellas be warned it is a little feminine, but it is a damn good read... Best Wishes and ALL my love!

       It's 1:23 and I find myself unable to sleep yet again. I was a real bitch to Victor today. I wanted to talk to someone, but my favorite bartender didn't answer his phone. *sigh* Not that he wanted to hear from me anyway. I'm positive I've become a pain in his ass. I Wish I had the ability to go back in time. Hindsight has become 20/20 for me and it's so abnoxious!!!! AGH! What's worse is that hindsight is even more of a  bitch  when you're hung over...  Why is it that I insist on going after the 'taboo'?! I mean, shit! It's not like I don't have enough drama in my life already!!! ( Or  that I don't exhude enough drama from every pore in my being...) And yet, I thrive on doing stupid ass shit that no one else would ever dream of doing!!! What the hell is my problem?!?!?  Ok, enough venting. Let's start over. One thing I have learned is that I've become way way too critical. It's become so easy for me to nit pick at friends, family and people in general just because it's easier than disecting myself. And another thing...when did I become such a potty mouth?!?! Ok, resolution time. No more swearing. I mean it. C'mon guys, I need your help here. I need a severe punishment that I can inflict on myself when I cuss. No, seriously...I want your input!!  September is fast approaching and it is a BAD month for my family. In all honestly, I do believe that we were cursed when Ronnie died. Something is going to happen to Grandma this coming month. My mom knows it and she is getting all her insurance stuff in order. Probably the cancer thing. When my Grandma goes, it's going to kill my mom. She's not stable as it is anyway. She can barely take care of herself...let alone my brother. Poor Richard, he wants to experience life and more importantly LOVE. My parents are afraid for him and I am too, but they are hindering his growth. And no matter how much I express this to them, they don't get it. Unfortunately, I believe that my parents give Richard an out... Let him stay handicapped in a sense.  Don't get me wrong. I know that he does have brain damage and epilepsy, but my parents (and my mother in particular) allow him not to progress or experience new things for their own sake. I do not know what they are afraid of.  I've been having these 'waking dreams.' I know that everyone has the ability to be intuitive...and I've always had some intuition...but damn it! Just what I need...more stuff to deal with and sort through. Lately, Niki has been talking to me. She's not my spirit guide, but she's stepping in for the next month or so until things settle down. I thank her very much and I love her deeply. I pray every night that Kyrheen will grow to know what a strong, determined, loving mother she has. Back to the waking dreams thing. I know for a fact that somewhere in the future my brother is going to be running or walking with Ethan and is going to be hit by a car. I don't know how to deal with this or who to tell. I want to know why this burden of truth was bestowed on me.  It's 3 am now, I had to take a break and rock Ashley to sleep. She's a little sickie...poor thing. That reminds me though of how lucky and blessed I am to have Ethan and Ashley in my life. To be a mother to two beautiful children. I love them more than life itself. I sat for a time this morning, and just watched them sleep. I was in awe of them and at the same time overwhelmed by the responsibility that I have to them.  I got in some recording time today with Brian. I can't believe how talented this guy is... I absolutely LOVE to sing, but am still unsure about my voice actually being released to the world...I'm doing this as a favor to you bud, so you better appreciate it! :)  I don't know what's up with FOX, but it's dubbed over in Spanish...random I know...let's change the channel...hmm...Reno 911 anyone? It's way past my bedtime...I have to be up in a couple of hours to work out, plus I still want to read a bit...so I think I'll go now.

       As I contemplate all the shit and happiness that has occurred in my life I feel like I don't even know myself. I don't know if it's the impending divorce (dum da dum dum) that is the catalyst for this movement or what, but I feel like I need to begin living my life as me. For as long as I remember I've been living my life as someone who has to prove something. That's been the motivating force in my life. Whether it has been my weight, the way I handle money, love, motherhood...Everything. Now that I am trying desperately to break the cycle I still second guess myself...Question my every move and play these stupid 20 question games in my head...AGH!  I meditated today for a long time. Trying to see myself and all the threads I've created and the blanket that I've weaved. It's a mass of tangles. I lost all track of time as I just sat and tried to unravel all the threads and create a blank canvas. I came to the conclusion that I can't. I have to accept the past for what it was. Learn and Live. I'm not an artist, but I desperately wish for my finished tapestry to something that my children and more importantly that I can be proud to call  Crystal.   I'm so disgusted with myself for letting myself get so needy. (As if this whole journal bit isn't proof of that...) Somewhere in time I've lost sight of who I really am. And because I've let myself get to that point, I have felt the need to mooch off energy of others...The sad thing is I can sit here and fucking analyze my actions and yet I don't know how to stop them. I remember a time when my energy flow was such that I made an impact, not left a void!  To those that I've met thus far; thank you. I do not want you to think that I regret any of the time or experiences that we've shared. This journal does in no way reflect the things that we have shared, or the paths yet to be crossed here on the earth! I will treasure any thoughts you'd like to share with me. I love you all!

      As of late, it seems that my life isn't the way it should be (judging by my standards... ) I have soo soo very much to be thankful for and still I am not satisfied. To all who are reading this I thank you for your time love and caring on this journey to a 'new me'. This is my first post.  So here are the rules on my part:    No ERASING   Editing only to correct spelling errors...  Write what you feel, when you feel it   Don't regret feelings or posts (meaning stop fucking apologizing!!)  Post every day...even if it's Hi this is me checking in...  Invite people to view my feelings and  comment    I'm living my life right now in this crazy mixed up world and it's time for me to accept that I have complete control of my time on this planet and my destiny. So this is my story...my rants and raves. Thank you for taking this journey with me
