      Thai people eat all the time, it seems. My Thai colleagues bring in a picnic to the teacher's lounge everyday around 3 PM, practically a whole meal. It's not fair that they can eat so much so often and remain thin. Not fair, NOT FAIR!!   Anyway, they brought in something new to try. I like trying new food, even if it seems disgusting. I was inspired when I read  urlLink Anthony Bourdain's   book 'A Cook's Tour'. Bourdain takes it upon himself to try anything and everything that others eat. The Thai teachers brought in a bag of deep fried frog skin. It tasted almost like pork rinds, but had a bit of an off aftertaste, so I had only one piece and that was enough.   Golf and I were supposed to meet an acquaintance last night downtown. It's a pain to get anywhere after work in a major city during the week because of gridlock traffic and rain and it made me tired just thinking about it. But we went and he didn't show up. Whatever. The ride there wasn't too horrible, but it does take an hour to get there.  Anyway, so we went to Asia Books after waiting and I bought a magazine, Redbook. I am officially in my mid-30s and married, trying to become a Mom. I guess that means that my Glamour magazines will be falling by the wayside for magazines like Oprah's 'O Magazine' and 'Redbook'. Well, I am embracing this new phase of my life and it feels great!

      From reading others' blogs I found these questions for bloggers every Monday, called  urlLink Monday Madness.   Since I'm a day ahead of the US, I'll post mine on Tuesdays!  Here's the latest:   1. Bed & Breakfast or hotel?   Neither, I prefer a guesthouse, especially if I am travelling in a foreign country. I've never been in a Bed and Breakfast before and if I am in the States, I usually stay in a  motel .    2. What determines where you stay?(i.e. price, accommodations, transportation, travel package)   Location, price and if it was recommended, either by a guidebook or by other travellers.   3. When determining where to stay, do you ever consider the establishment's history? (i.e. it might be haunted, location of high profile crime)   This usually factors into the recommendations from other travellers. If a place has a reputation, good or bad, people will talk about it.    4. Would such considerations sway your decision?  Of course! I'm not going to stay in a filthy, noisy guesthouse in a bad part of town!    5. Do you try and read the local paper for where you're visiting, to get an idea of what the area's like?   Depends if it is in English or not! If there is a local English newspaper I'll pick up a copy now and then. I'm a regular reader of the Bangkok Post and when I was in Nepal, I read the Kathmandu newspaper.

      Yesterday I got a bout of homesickness. Thank god for Golf being there with me while I bitched and complained. It all started when I bought a magazine from an old magazine/book shop that sells outdated materials that didn't sell in stores. It was a SELF magazine, four years old, but with some good articles on fitness. I also got a little homesick surfing online earlier too.   We were standing in line at Tops, the grocery store, in the 8 items or less aisle and the woman two people ahead of us had a whole cart full of groceries. She was dressed nicely though and the cashier said nothing. In the States, she'd be told that this is an express line, please go to another line -- wouldn't matter if you are wearing Gucci or not. Here, if you look wealthy, your butt gets kissed day after day of the week and you are an exception to the rules. Thais have rank and social order and while we do too to a degree in the States, we still treat everyone as equals in everyday situations. It made me sick.  I like how we show RESPECT for those who have much by the achievements they have made. We don't bow before them and grovel before them. This is the Asian way and I don't like it at all. This is what made me homesick yesterday...   HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANNA!

      It's SOOO nice to be a bit lazy. Just this morning I finished The Stand, by Stephen King. It was really good, and it's one of his older books, published in the mid-80s, I think. The next book on my list is called "The God of Small Things" by Arundhati Roy. I've never heard of her before, but I went to the Amazon website and she got all good reviews. We shall see.   Yesterday Golf and I had our Thai massages. I can't complain since we each got a two hour massage for 300 baht, which equals a little over $7 each person. But the room had a television, and it went on. Soft music would have been better. Then Golf's masseuse got several phone calls on her mobile, which really irritated me -- it was highly unprofessional. At least she offered to make up for the lost time (about 10 minutes) to him, but he said nevermind, just give some extra attention to his bad back.  Sometimes the massage was painful and as I was wincing under the pain, I thought that a good massage isn't without a little discomfort. I did feel like jelly afterward!   Today Golf and I will try and get to the fitness center. I haven't been there on a weekend yet. I was too tired after the massage yesterday to go, but hey, during the weekdays we go on a regular basis, so I don't feel too badly.   I'm now an active poster on Babycenter.com's Trying to Conceive web board! It feels great to start this new phase in my life! Now the rest is up to  The Higher Powers That Be .  UGH. Work tomorrow.

      Seems like every weekend Golf and I have somewhere to go, whether it's shopping, meeting up with friends or seeing a movie. (Life is so tough, ain't it?!) Well this is the first weekend day we've had that we've got nothing planned! It's so wonderful! We're spending a good chunk of time here at the internet cafe, then we will go get some lunch and later this afternoon go get a Thai style massage. MMMMM!!!   I do hope that movie theatres here in Bangkok release Michael Moore's new movie, "Farenheit 9/11". Golf got his last movie on DVD and it was real good, and judging by the reviews, his new one is supposedly even more provocative. I look forward to seeing it!

      On Fridays, I am finished teaching by noon and I have the rest of the afternoon to prepare lessons for Monday, or surf the internet and listen to my favorite radio station with streaming audio.   I've never been much of a writer, but this new blogging thing might be a good way to get into the habit and record my thoughts and feelings. Especially now because Golf and I are going to start trying for a baby and I'm really excited about it!   Yesterday we bought some Centrum vitamins for both of us to start taking AND I am slowing down on my smoking -- 2 1/2 on Wednesday and 2 yesterday. I hope to have only 2 today and that many only over the weekend too. I want us to be healthier when TTC.   This weekend we are supposed to go get Thai massages. Mmmm that will feel great!

       Golf just updated his   urlLink   website     with our new photos from yesterday's ceremony at the temple plus some other miscellaneous photos I wanted to share. I hope you enjoy it!    &nbsp;  Not much happening on the first day of our three day holiday. Just been working on our finances, and I think we will be doing pretty good once we return to the US. That's always a comforting thought that you are better off than you thought you were.     &nbsp;  We are supposed to  finally  get our landline (telephone) early next week and I hope it actally happens. This will mean that we can log onto the internet  from home  at  anytime we want to . We've been waiting for months to do this. I mostly go online from school and from the internet cafe on the weekends. Golf has to come to the internet cafe every day and he gets his jobs from files sent online. This is his  LIVLIHOOD ! So having that available to us at home will be a vast improvement that is highly anticipated.

       Tomorrow will be Asharnha Bucha Day, a Buddhist holiday that celebrates the start of Lent for the monks. Today our school went to the nearby temple and did the ceremony one day early since the real holiday is on a Saturday.     &nbsp;   Asharnha Bucha has its roots long ago when monks were so poor that they could not even get a candle to light their way at the temple. It was also rainy season, so they were discouraged from walking across rice fields to collect alms since it would damage the crops.     &nbsp;   So began the Buddhist Lent, where the tradition is that the monks, for the next three months during monsoon season, stay cloistered in the temples and devotees bring them everything that they need, including&nbsp;candles!&nbsp;The holiday marks the beginning of this three month period and the highlight is the intricately carved candles that are offered as merit.     Devotees bring food, money, toietries, lightbulbs, flowers, candles, and other necessities to the temple. They circle the temple clockwise three times. This can&nbsp; be accompanied with&nbsp;musical instuments and drumming.&nbsp; The devotees then go inside the temple and make their offering to the monks.     Today at school we did this, the entire school went and we had the processional as described above. There were about four other schools there from around the neighborhood complete with dancing girls in traditional dress and marching bands. It was quite a show! And many BEAUTIFUL carved candles with flowers and garlands. I took many photos on my digital camera and if Golf uploads them to his website, I will post a link to it over the weekend on my blog.     &nbsp;   So Monday will be a holiday since the real holiday is on Saturday.  NO WORK! YAY!  I love three day weekends!!! We don't have a whole lot planned, but that's alright. Perhaps I will work on the coloring book I am trying to illustrate!

       Golf made an appointment today with an immigration lawyer and&nbsp;we will meet with them next&nbsp;Tuesday at 2:30 PM. The timing of our&nbsp;meeting and marriage might&nbsp;look suspicious to officials,&nbsp;especially when they see that he came back to Thailand from the USA after only a mere month before meeting me.&nbsp;There are some other&nbsp;issues that we are concerned about&nbsp;as well, and better to know about them now than later. Golf was going to start his visa process in October and we want to make sure&nbsp;that is still feasible, or if he should start even sooner.&nbsp; &nbsp;

       At work we foreign teachers are doing a DVD exchange. Golf had bought the  Bowling for Columbine  DVD and since I had already seen it, I brought it for others to see. One of the teachers brought  Farenheit 9/11 , and of course, after all the hype it has received and Michael Moore's outspoken reputation, this is a film not to be missed.     &nbsp;  I'm trying to keep up on the politics, especially since the presidential election is coming up. The Democratic National Convention is happening this&nbsp;week, so I have been keeping up with it on CNN.com.&nbsp;Today after I am finished teaching, I plan to&nbsp;go to the US Embassy website to see how I can register to vote as an absentee. The presidential election is a rather big deal! &nbsp;

       Yesterday Golf and I went to a special fertility shrine in Bangkok. The shrine is dedicated to a goddess and there are phalluses everywhere in this small shrine. It place just about pulses with virility and fertility. Golf and I bought jasmine wreaths, candles and incense and we prayed to the Goddess for a positive August. I hope she listened!    &nbsp;  Yesterday was also my first day of not smoking  at all . YAY! Not as difficult as I had thought. My mantra that totally turns me off to smoking is, "I want a baby  more  than I want a cigarette." After I say that to myself, I don't want to even go near them.&nbsp;In one week I will be in our fertile time&nbsp;and I want to be nicotine free for a week. I'm also down to a cup and a half of coffee and beginning tomorrow, only one cup. I love coffee, but I would love to have a baby more. Again, that is my mantra and these habits can easily be kicked when put into perspective.     &nbsp;  Golf's also got our wedding video and photo CDs ready to mail. Will get them out today!     &nbsp;

       Hearing about a&nbsp;fellow foreign teacher's visa woes yesterday got me feeling depressed about living here, like if I&nbsp;get too much of a hassle getting my visa and work permit, I am tempted to just forget about it and come back to the States early. But that simply isn't an option now because I have a husband who is a Thai national and we have to make the time to do the immigration process properly to the US and apparantly it takes  alot  of time! I just have to have faith&nbsp;and patience that the process here will work out alright. My school likes me a lot and I think they will do what they can to keep me here. Sometimes I just get tired of the whole thing and I get to deal with it in the next coming weeks because&nbsp;my visa expires on August 11th.&nbsp; Such is the price to pay for an exciting life of living abroad. :)    &nbsp;  So since I was feeling&nbsp;down yesterday, I was&nbsp;in no&nbsp;mood to go to aerobics. I was feeling crampy, bloated, frustrated, homesick and sad.&nbsp; To pick me up, my dear husband&nbsp;read my mind as usual and suggested we go to the mall and eat at Sizzler (salad bar!) and&nbsp;go see  I, Robot . What a fantastic movie! I&nbsp;would like to see it again to&nbsp;catch some subtle parts of the strory line. You really have to pay attention and I like movies like that. &nbsp;&nbsp;    Today I am feeling a little better. I am going to eat less this week, I feel&nbsp;like I have been stuffing my face with way too much food my clothes are starting to fit more tightly. Not a good sign! Will do the weights again as well and sit-ups at least until after we've had our fertile time for trying for baby. I don't know if doing sit ups is harmful if you've just conceived, so I don't want to take any chances. Anyway, tomorrow (Friday) is also my last day of smoking PERIOD.&nbsp; I smoked two yesterday and 1 1/2 the day before.&nbsp; Tomorrow will make it exactly one week before my fertile time and I want to be nicotine free for a week before we do the nasty.&nbsp; Tomorrow and over the weekend, Golf and I will also enjoy the last bottle of Merlot I brought from California. Gotta have one perk for not getting&nbsp;preggo this month! &nbsp;

       For the first time in a long time, I am looking forward to returning to the US permanently. I now have a wonderful husband who also misses California, and my life will be different. We are researching starting our own business. We want to work for ourselves! I could never do something like this on my own back in the States, and to be married to someone with the courage and desire to do his own thing makes all the difference in the world. I would rather work for  us  in our own shop; I will happily work many hours, take our future child with us into the store, or take my work home with me if I want to go home early had have Golf hold down the fort, or vice versa. So many options. We can do it! So we have some time to plan.     &nbsp;   I also plan to open up a CD with a financial institution that allows new accounts online. Why should I keep funds in my bank account sitting around doing nothing when I could invest in a&nbsp;two year certificate of deposit and get a much higher interest rate on it? My colleague informed me of one institution and I looked at them online. Will probably open an account with them today.

       I've been free since 1 pm today and am feeling a little bored and restless. Did some online research for Golf concerning opening a business in California and tried to find some info on finances. Am quitting Baby Center for awhile, getting too caught up in it and it raises my hopes too high.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Just feeling a little depressed and a bit homesick today. &nbsp;I miss my family.&nbsp; I'm tired of Thailand and Thais a little bit today (my husband not included of course!). I need to get up and do some drawing for my coloring book. Perhaps I will bring it home this evening and work on it.   &nbsp; &nbsp;

       1. Do you prefer to be out in the sun or in the shade?  Shade. Now that I'm in my mid 30s I want to do everything I can to protect my skin from premature aging. I don't want so many wrinkles!     2. Regarding the walls in your house, do you prefer neutral colors or bright colors?  Bright colors, or I should say rich colors. When I see home improvement shows on TLC, I see how much of a difference a richly colored wall makes. It's beautiful! I also love faux finishes. &nbsp;    3. When hanging pictures on your walls, do you like things symmetric or asymmetric?  Asymmetric because it creates more movement.     4. How about where you'd like to live; country or city?  City. I like to get out to the country for relaxation. But the city is more exciting.     5. Your blog; Blogger, Blogdrive, Blog-City, or another one altogether?  Blogger.     6. Email; Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, or other?  Yahoo.    7. Air conditioning or just a fan when it's hot at night?  I live in South East Asia. I use AC!!!     8. Dinner; seafood or steak?  Seafood. It's cheap and delicious here, so I am taking advantage of its abundance. Once I'm back in California, it will be very expensive again.     9. Your all-time favorite music media; CD's, cassette tapes, or vinyl (or 8-tracks)?  CDs. I especially like it that you can record your own CDs now.     10. When learning a new software program, do you find it easier to follow a book or an online tutorial?  Online tutorial.

       My period came today.&nbsp; I was soooo certain I was pregnant, so that shows me how convincing the mind can make you feel. I really  did  feel some cramping every day during my two week waiting time. I really  did  feel a little nauscious every now and then...&nbsp; Oh well. It's our first month trying and I don't think that it happens for that many couples their first month trying.  &nbsp;   So now  I'm focusing on other things. I'm also  not  going to obssess about it by going to BabyCenter.com all the time. I will post one last thing there (to say&nbsp;goodbye for now) and check&nbsp;for my fertile time next&nbsp;month. I am going to have only one cup of coffee per day instead of two. And as of today, I'm stopping my 2 cigarettes per day habit. No more. I don't want any habits to impair my ability to become a mommy!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I just returned with my dear husband from a lovely four day break down in Ko Chang near Trat. It is an island near Cambodia. We stayed at Lonely Beach and it was nice and quiet. We stayed at a nice little bungalow on the water for only 100 Baht per night, which costs, what, a little over $2? It was very relaxing, although there was a bar down the beach a ways and at night the water would carry the sounds of the music til it closed. You can't have everything though. And it wasn't so loud I couldn't sleep. But Golf and I had a wonderful time.  &nbsp; We have Sunday (today)&nbsp;to rest up, do laundry and&nbsp;grocery shopping and go online. Tomorrow it's back to work. It was a&nbsp;wonderful little retreat!&nbsp;

      Golf and I plan to go to Koh Chang tomorrow by bus. This will be my second time there, but Golf hasn't been yet. I hope it doesn't rain the whole time.   One of the assistant vice principals called me last night, the person who works with the farang teachers in all the issues. She was asking about another American co-worker because her visa is expiring and has to get another 10 day extension for nearly $50 fee. The thing is that she is to go on Friday,  right in the middle of our vacation time!!!  My colleage is burned out and we all need this little bit of time off. So far she hasn't come into the office and it's 8:30AM right now. I think she's insisting she have the extension done today.   I know immigration is a hassle in any country. Golf tells me it's a burden in the States too. But still it's a little more organized and there is no having to leave the country to get a certain type of visa etc. What am I going to do next May if I am heavily pregnant or have a newborn baby? Am I going to have to leave the country?    I told Golf that I would like to come back to the States soon after the baby is born and is sturdy enough to travel. We need to get adequate international health insurance for a long enough time to cover the family until we can get some sort of independent health coverage in the States. Well, all this is nice to speculate over, but I need to see if I'm even pregnant first!   Anyway, enough whinging for today. I may not be able to post again until Sunday when we get back from Koh Chang.

      Golf and I found a great new bookstore that just opened about a month ago. Here in Bangkok, there are no real libraries, so we buy and sell used books. It's called  urlLink Dasa Books . Today I bought a new  urlLink Nancy Chandler  Activity Book (I already have her map and coloring book.) And I bought  urlLink The Millionaire Next Door  and  urlLink 4,000 Days: My Life and Survival in a Bangkok Prison . Both look like interesting reads for when I am finished with The Mists of Avalon. I also am interested in reading the whole story of the Legend of King Arthur. I need to read some more classics.

      I haven't been able to go online the last few days because I've been so busy and also no internet access! I tell ya, at this school, there is always  something  going wrong. There is constantly (at varying occasions) no copy paper, the toner will be out on the photocopy machine, the printer is out of ink or just doesn't work, the internet is down, the electricity is down, the A/C doesn't work, some one forgot the keys so you can't get inside your class room or the teacher's lounge. It's always SOMETHING. I've learned to really go with the flow and have tried to be as patient as I possibly can, but we foreign teachers grumble justifiably!  This Sunday Golf and I will have our first family function together as husband and wife. It is a yearly event in which departed family members are honored. I'm looking forward to being a part of the ceremony, even though I won't know a word of what's being said.  Next week, the International AIDS Conference is in town and schools are required to close so that traffic congestion is eased. We will be required to go to work on Monday and Tuesday, but will have Wednesday onward off. Golf and I plan to go to Koh Chang (Elephant Island) and enjoy the beach. It will be lovely to enjoy some peace and quiet, although our neighborhood is pretty good as it is, for being in Bangkok!  Golf and I saw  Spiderman  last night. Very well done! Even better than the first, I think this superhero series is the best so far, with the possible exception of  Superman  back in the 80s.   So far I'm loving my book, Mists of Avalon. This is good timing becase the movie, "King Arthur" is opening at the end of this month, and it will be relevent with my book. Back to movies, I'm looking forward to seeing "King Arthur" and "I, Robot". Since movies are so cheap here in Thailand, Golf and I are indulging often!  Lastly, it's now the waiting game. Two weeks waiting to see if Golf and I must try again next month for baby. Let's hope that I'm  pregnant !!! :)

       urlLink    1. I usually clean my house on  Saturday , or about every  7  days. 2. My favorite Sunday night program to watch on television is  (Since I live in Thailand, all the channels are in Thai language. So I don't watch TV any day of the week!)  3. Monday morning I usually waking up thinking, " Here we go again ." 4. To wind down at the end of a busy day, I like to  take a 45 minute rest then go to the fitness center and do my powerwalk and/or aerobics . 5. I try not to call anyone on the phone until after  10  a.m. 6. And I NEVER call anyone after  9:00 PM . 7. When I don't have to get up to go to work or school, I sleep in until  only 7 AM. My body is very used to getting up so early that 7 AM IS sleeping in at least an hour!  8. I have  3  telephones in my house.  But we have no landline! So one phone is not being used at all and the other two are my husband's and my mobile phones!   9. I usually answer the phone on the  second  ring.  But sometimes I don't hear my mobile ringing in my purse or it takes awhile to find it, and by then it's on the tenth ring or so!  10. When I know I should be sleeping, but am having a hard time falling asleep, I usually  read my book .

      Golf and I went to Benjawan's house warming party and birthday. She lives out nearby where I lived and worked previously, by Ramintra Road. There was a big awning erected in the middle of the small soi with tables laden with food and lots of people sitting around grubbing. We arrived just before 9AM and had  A LOT  of food. People were also drinking  WHISKY  first thing in the morning!  CRAZY!!!     Benjawan, Golf's former boss, is a very nice woman, but still quite jetlagged! Her house is brand new with 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. Nice looking from the outside, but not what I would buy.   The houses here in Thailand just aren't cozy. I like a cozy house. Anna and Jimmy's place is cozy. Mom and Dad's house is  (was!)  cozy and Mel and Daryll's place is cozy. I think it's my cultural upbringing and the fact is that it's too hot here in Thailand to ever want to be cozy. You want to be cool! Eh, sometimes I just feel a little homesick, that's all. But I am still happy!  The next few days are supposed to be my fertile ones, so Golf and I will be busy trying for baby! What a wonderful way to spend a weekend. :) :)

      Golf and I went to the mall last night in search of a nice gift for his former boss who is in town. It was payday for most people and the mall was PACKED like it was a Saturday afternoon. Plus Spiderman 2 premiered. We'll wait to see it after a few weeks and the crowds die a bit.   I found a new book while I was there, at a used book store. It's called  urlLink The Mists of Avalon  by Marion Zimmer Bradley. In my other book, The God of Small Things, the language is too flowery, too many metaphors, like the author is trying really hard to impress us with her knowledge of English. Boring--just tell me a story already!   So Golf found a nice bath set in Central, inside a purple silk box. I think it's a good gift and we are all set to meet Benjawan on Saturday. I felt such relief leaving the mall; there is nothing worse than going in with the intention to buy something specific and coming out empty handed.

      Golf told me last night that his ex-boss, Benjawan, is back in Bangkok for a visit. He told her last night some special news that he couldn't write her on an email about: he is now married! She was in the process of getting Golf's green card, but of course she doesn't have to do that anymore. She's real excited about the news and is looking forward to meeting me, and likewise with me because I've heard so much about her.   So Benjawan has bought a house in BKK and wants Golf and I to attend her house warming party and it's also her birthday. So tonight Golf and I are gonig to the mall to try and find a suitable birthday present for the party on Saturday.   I feel so close to my husband, especially recently as we have started to try for a baby. Trying to make a new life is so exciting and special! I've cut down on the caffeine, no easy task, and I've been getting some headaches. Smoking only 2 cigarettes per day, and even that I will cut back too, for sure by next month if my period comes. NO smokes by next month, whether or not I am PG. We have both been taking Centrum vitamins.   My hip though, has been acting up. I think from aerobics. The twisting action has made the joint VERY sore and painful, so I have decided to stop aerobics for about a week and just powerwalk for an hour and lift weights intstead. My hip doesn't hurt when I walk, since I don't twist. The last time my hip hurt like this was when I was trekking in Nepal and I was a few days away from the nearest VILLAGE!!  Fortunately it went away...

       I haven't been writing as much as I normally do, and I guess it's because not much has been going on worth writing about!       I'm getting bored doing aerobics. The instructor who comes the most days during the week plays the same music with the same routine and I am bored stiff with it, so the last 5 days or so I've just been powerwalking and jogging around the track.      And that's if I'm lucky and it doesn't rain. Yesterday I had to cut my workout short about 20 minutes because it started raining. Well, it  is  monsoon season and it does rain often nowadays. :)

        urlLink Monday Madness    1. If you could only take one item with you on to a desserted island what book, movie, music would you take?   urlLink The Journeyer , by Gary Jennings.    2. What's the most disgusting thing that you have ever eaten or even just put in your mouth??  urlLink  Balut   , a Philippine delicacy, which is a fertilized duck egg and the embryo is nearly completely developed. I just took a taste, I couldn't bear to eat much. But I like to be brave and try new things, thanks to reading Anthony Bourdain's books of daring cuisine!     3. What one thing would you do differently if given the chance?  Travel at an earier age. I didn't go to my first foreign country til I was 29. I would have majored in English at university, gotten a teaching credential and travel more around the world. Here in Thailand so many teachers and tourists are in their early to mid twenties. I would have done it for awhile to fund more travel, then get serious in my late twenties and early thirties back in home.     4. What political party, if any, do you belong to?  I am registered as an Independent.   I want to vote Green, Libertarian, Democrat or even Republican if I choose.     5. Do you like icees?  Sure, but I like ice cream better. :)    6. East or West?  Depends. East for it's religious philisophies (Buddhism and Hinduism) it's rich culture, history, architecture and food.   The West is also good for it's liberal thinking, technological progress, history, philosophy, art, and food too. :)     7. Will we ever "all" be happy with the current political situation????  Heavens no... never.    8. Cookies or Crackers?  Reduced fat Cheezits.     9. What fun thing did you do today?...  My Blog. Hey, it's MONDAY.    and #10 has nothing to do with any of the above questions.........   10. Why??  Why not??

       urlLink  Sunday Brunch    School Days   1.  Did you like or dislike high school?  I liked it when I lived in Seattle. I didn't like my high school days in Sacramento. I went to 3 different high schools. Zillah was alright, but not the greatest. Seattle though, was ALOT of fun!    2.  Walk to school, ride the bus or catch a ride with someone?  I walked to school, both in Seattle and in Sacramento. I rode the bus in Zillah.     3.  What was your favorite subject?  Art    4.  When it came to doing homework, did you do it right away, wait 'til the last minute or just do it whenever you felt like it?  Research and term papers I generally waited til the last minute.     5.  Would you go to your high school reunion?  No because I wasn't close to anybody in Sacramento and I still reside in California (actually I reside in Bangkok, but will return to California sometime next year) and Washington State is too far away to go. My past is my past.

       How I love Sundays!   Acutally I think I love Saturdays even more because I know I have one more day off and the whole weekend is a wonderful thing. So I am savoring my other day off. Golf and I have nothing planned today, but I think I'm just going to clean the apartment and go jogging at the fitness center tonight after it cools down.       I got bored doing the aerobics -- the same instructor with the same routine with the same music -- it got  boring ! So I started jogging and it gave me a really good workout and it felt wonderful! I think I made almost two miles, which is very good, considering I haven't gone jogging for a long time. My right hip has been bothering me for the last few months. I hope it isn't arthritis setting in -- I'm still relatively young! But the main reason I had to stop jogging and start walking is the hip started aching. Ouch! I hope the jogging will strengthen the muscles around the joint and help it out.     Last night Golf and I saw the movie  Alien vs. Predator . It   was alright, certainly not a thinking person's movie. One critic described it as an intergalatic cockfight, which is highly accurate! That about sums up the entire movie. Next on our movie list is  House of Flying Daggers,  made by the same director as  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon . It looks beautifully done, so we will probably see it during the week.      We also finished season one of 24. We are HOOKED on that series. Golf went in search for season two on DVD, but did not find it. WAH! And Blockbuster only has season one. The show made me feel exhausted watching it sometimes, it was so high energy and it made you think alot. I love storylines like that  and  I adore Kiefer Sutherland! :)

       It's time for  urlLink Friday's Feast !       Appetizer     Who is your favorite news anchor/reporter? Why?    I don't have one at the moment since I live in Bangkok, I prefer to get my news from the Internet. Ask me this again when I move back to California! :)        Soup    Name   3 foods that are currently in your freezer.    I don't have 3. I have only one, and that is periodically. It's bread that I buy sometimes from the bakery, decent bread, not the soft milk-toast kind Thais call bread here. And ice.         Salad     If you were to have the opportunity to name a new town or city, what would you call it?    I would name the town after my maiden name. If you know me, you know what it is!        Main Course     What will most likely be the next book you read?    urlLink  4000 Days: My Life &amp; Survival in a Bangkok Prison    by Warren Fellows.        Dessert     What's the first thing you notice about the opposite gender?    The face.

       Tomorrow is a national holiday -- it's the Queen's birthday, so the day is marked as Mother's Day. (As you may guess, the King's birthday is Father's Day on December 5th). So today we had the ceremony in the morning and we have to wear these school uniforms that the men  do not  have to buy, and  all  of us had to wear jackets. My god, it's  hot  here, in case you haven't noticed!       Well tomorrow is a holiday, the school is closed. I'm happy enough because Thursdays are my busiest days.       I heard from my mom and dad on email today. Good to hear from them -- I don't hear from them regularly since they retired and took off in the trailer n truck across the country. I miss them.

       Today's the day I have to go to Thai immigration. I'm not much looking forward to it, but hopefully it will go smoothly, I don't know why it wouldn't. For some reason I can only get an extension, about 10 days, instead of my stamp that will keep me in this country until May.  I think it is because the work permit isn't ready yet. The procedures and red tape in this country is remarkable! Many of us foreign teachers are discovering why many flee Thailand for better shores such as Japan or Taiwan: Better pay and less hassle. I think that if I weren't married, I'd consider going to Japan or Taiwan.      Work's been stressing me out too. We had a teacher's meeting yesterday and the school is due for another Ministry of Education visit and this time the visit is even more important. We have to have student portfolios of their work (which I had been sending home every week so parents could see what their child is doing that week) and assessment of the students using criteria that is vague at best. Their three different criteria kind of all blend into one another and it is difficult to discern one type from another. It's enough to make me pull my hair out.       Then we have an upcoming science fair. Science fair projects! What a joke. A fellow colleague suggested Dinosaurs as a theme. That's what we are going to do and the fair is in a few weeks. First of all, my kids aren't STUDYING dinosaurs. We have science  once  a week for 50 minutes. To study a topic that is unrelated to what we are doing in class is a waste of precious time. Plus there isn't enough time to fully study dinosaurs to make the project worth doing correctly. So I will have to do it the Thai way, half-assed but looking nice. Whatever. UGH!! Sometimes it's incredibly frustrating working within the system that exists here.

       I got  urlLink Monday Madness  on Monday! YAY!   1. What's "it" all about, anyway?  Knowing thyself.    2. What radical political ideas do you have, if any?  Quality, affordable health care for all people. A fairly liberal idea, but is it really so radical?      3. Do you believe that you 'fit' the profile of your astrological star sign?  Yes, so much so it's sometimes CREEPY!    4. Will blogging survive 2005 or is it a fad?  I think it will last. I like it, it encourages me to write my thoughts and I think there are many people like me who feel the same way. I love reading other people's blogs, I'm nosy and I don't mind sharing my life with others either. Everybody's got an interesting story to tell!    5. Do you Ebay? If so, what and how often? Is it a full-time job, part-time hobby, or just to clear the junk from your house?  I do not Ebay. I have never used it.     6. True or False: When I vote, I am all for one party.  False.     7. Meat or veggie sauce on your spaghetti?  Veggie. Spaghetti is already a 'heavy' food. Having a light sauce is better.     8. Would you ever be on a TV Reality Show?  No. Blogging is as public as I go for reality in my life.     9. What is one  thing  (or place) that you would like  to do  (or see) that you have  not yet done  (or seen?)  I would like to experience motherhood.    10. Do you answer memes honestly?  Yes, the truth is always more interesting than fiction.

       This week I have to deal with getting my visa updated. It expires on Wednesday and I'll be getting a 10-day extension for a little less than $50. Kind of expensive for only 10 days! Today I had to get a "medical certificate" which is basically a statement saying you are alive, have a pulse, breathe and have a weight. I guess Thailand wants teachers who aren't dead or nearly so! It just seems like a really funny formality in order to be able to teach in this country.     Then I get to sign a stack of papers. They photocopied my passport  4 times!  And I mean every single page on it that has a stamp. The government needs to know I've been to Egypt back in 1999, I guess. I have to sign every single page. 4 times. My original documents such as my university diploma, transcripts and teaching certificate were copied twice and I signed all those too.   Now I've done this a few times before -- those times I applied for a work permit. I've signed all this stuff before. One day, the Thai bureaucracy will discover the wonder of  computers!  The fact that there is this much paperwork year after year signing the same photocopied documents is ridiculous! All this data should be on a computer within the agency. Like the rest of the developed world. It's absolutely amazing. No wonder this country is called Amazing Thailand!

        urlLink Sunday Brunch    Another This and That   1. How do you like your eggs?  Sunny side up with nice runny yokes!    2. What do you collect?  Foreign currency from countries I have been to, or friends have been to.     3. Do you carry a purse, backpack or briefcase on a regular basis? If yes, does it contain only the essentials or a whole lot of everything?  I carry a purse and it has the essentials, although it's always full to bursting.     4. When is the last time you've read a book, put together a puzzle, built something or did something crafty?  I always have a book to read. Right now I am reading the   urlLink  Mists of Avalon   . Since I teach art to kids here, I do artsy craftsy things on a fairly regular basis. Puzzle: Golf and I bought a Cat in the Hat book and puzzle for his grand nephew for his birthday and I helped him put it together. I don't build things, I let my husband do that. :)    5. What was the highlight of your weekend?  Getting my hair colored!

       urlLink  Friday Feast     Appetizer     Name 3 things that you think are beautiful.   butterflies, the ocean, and sunsets     Soup    What was the last concert you attended?  Oh my gosh, it was so long ago that I don't even remember! I can tell you concerts that I have attended, but I cannot tell you which one was the last one, I'm sorry to say. :(      Salad     What is one thing that frightens you about getting older?  Not being able to have a baby. I am 33 years old, and I'm trying to get pregnant. I know women have babies at this age, but I know that my age is also working against me at this point.      Main Course     Tell us about one of your funny quirks or habits.  I am addicted to talk radio and I even listen to it on the Internet when I am living in Thailand. I am even listening right now!      Dessert     If you could extend one month to 50 days (instead of the normal 28, 29, 30, or 31), which month would you want to lengthen? June.  Back in the States, it's kind of the official kick off of summer and that's when the time changes to an hour later and people just seem happier in general. It's also not too hot yet and it's just overall very enjoyable.

       Golf and I opened an account at Blockbuster Video and they have VCDs of the TV series  24 , with Kiefer Sutherland. We could not stop watching and ended up in front of the TV for four episodes! I can see how it got critical acclaim, I am  hooked !       Not much on the plate for today. I guess I could say that for the last couple of days it has been rainy in the evenings so I haven't been able to work out. Golf has been going to lift weights during the day time since it is less crowded then, but I haven't been able to get any exercise!

       I'm frustrated with myself. After a 33-year-old habit of biting my fingernails terribly, I kicked the habit nearly two years  ago .  Somehow I just stopped.  For over a year and a half, I had beautiful nails, and I still do have regular manicures, but recently, like the last two months, I've been biting them, again. They don't look terrible, my cuticles are still intact and I didn't bite too much off, but still. It's a little depressing. I want my pretty nails back! :( :(

      Golf and I ended up going to Wat Samien last night for Asarnha Bucha Day and by the time we circled the temple and asked for blessings and sat inside the main temple, it had started POURING! And it didn't stop, only got worse. What a start to monsoon season!  Fantastic news: We finally got our phone line!!! I am now posting from my very own laptop computer on my kitchen table with my pajamas still on. I love it!! But Golf is patiently waiting his turn and I've been hogging the phone line since 8 this morning.   Last night after getting back from the temple, I watched the DVD of Shrek 2. It was a cute story and it's amazing what they can do with computer animation nowadays. After watching that movie, we popped in Stargate.
