      I thought this whole having kids thingy was a good idea.  I mean my parents did it, millions of people have done it, so it cannot be "that" bad....Ha!  I was hood-winked, hornswoggled, led astray! It is VERY difficult, mentally, and you end up bone weary physically.  For example, my 3 year old has just DECIDED to begin going to the potty....she has known HOW to do it for MONTHS.  However, she just did not FEEL like going on her own...and I believe she sensed that she completely exasperated me with the whole situation, though I TRIED to remain neutral.  She would go whenever I accompanied and verbally guided her through every step...but never on her own, not even a vague indication that she had to go.  She would have been just as happy to sit in a puddle of pee (or other distusting puddles) if I let her.  Then one day she just made a 360 degree turnaround.  She not only was going, but alone, and didn't want any help.  Needless to say, I am relieved but, it is still a battle, because while she is being very independent, she's STILL three and making another kind of mess now.  Then there's the whole attitude change that came with the new potty independence.  She has developed a "smart mouth" and a "hard head" overnight...inevitably picked up from her daycare peers, but I (foolishly) thought she may not pick up the plethora of bad habits that I observed at school but did not immediately follow her home.  GONE is my sweet baby that did what I asked without question, and rarely had a temper tantrum. (Sigh...)  I'm whining, I know....but thats what I feel like doing here. It will keep me from showing frustration with her if I get it out by another method. Please do not comment on how I need to cut her a break, blah-blah-blah, I know, OKAY???.  If you would like to whine and complain about your kids (who you are nonetheless taking great care of) too then fine....but PLEASE do not lecture to me, I do not want to hear it.  I am surrounded by so-called "perfect" parents that are super dedicated and enjoying EVERY minute of their "darling" kids. WHATever.  I love my children, I will do anything for them, and I will destroy anyone who trys to harm them....but I just do not always LIKE my job as Mommy. (Which, by the way I do well, and cheerfully.)   Oh, how I long for the peacefulness of the days of single-life, with no one to take care of/ follow behind/ consort with/ argue with/ or clean  up after but my self....if I felt like it.  Ah, well....enough of that.  Mess to conquer, diapers to change, baths to give, stories to read (pause, then start over)....no rest for the weary. Tired-Momi
