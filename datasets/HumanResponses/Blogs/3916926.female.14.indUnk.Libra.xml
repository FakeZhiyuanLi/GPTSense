DALLAS ALWAYS BRINGS THE MOST PEOPLE. if you have the most people im sure there are some hot guys in the group. of course im right. yeah plus i got to see my friend TYLER! ahh i was so happy!! alright so we get there and unpack and go eat dinner and i didnt really know anyone so then we went to worship and hangout until 1:30 am and then we went to bed! i never really make new friends the first day. so on the second day i&nbsp;woke up and got ready and everything and went to breakfast and morning worship which was fun. then it was activites for the day. thats when i met peter. hes a really great cute guy. so we spent the day together. we went rock climbing and on this mountain bike trail and everything. it was a lot of fun. and i dont know if i ever liked him but i heard he liked me a lot. yeah and also that day i met jon B. hes a cool kid. and a good friend. it was funny because in the beginning he thought i was 16 and i thought he was like 12 or something. but naww were the same age. we hung out a lot and stuff it was fun. that night had a good worship service and then we hit the hay. oh yah and during all these days im meeting about 20 girls. and i dont really want to go through all of them. because im only going through the people who i really hung out with. alrighty so the next day i wake up and blahblahblah then after all that i go into sisters for shopping. one problem. there is no ride for about 10 of us. so slowly but surely it only ended up that 6 of us. so we sat on this bridge thing until SOMEONE took us to sisters. it took an hour but me, ty, jeff, J.R, megan, and sam all squeezed into this car with jackie and kourtney. they were just two REALLY awsome girls.&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;    well yeahhh we went to sisters and hung out a lot. it was a lot of fun, and then i guess J.R likes me and hes really cool. he's 15, ty is 17, and jeff is 20. he was a counsler and ty's cousin but hes cool. the next day we hung out with MI HARD ROCK AMIGO...lee, STEPHANIE SMITH...shes awsome, TY, JEFF AND J.R, JON B, TYLER, MY #1 FAN, EVERYONEEEE it was fun!!      &nbsp;     then that night i met JON S! hes hot. but hes a player and well you all know i fall for them stupid players. and then we hung out like the whole day the next day which was also our last day. but we hung out a lot!! then in my little thing where you write down phone numbers he said "hi, your hot," and then wrote down his number! it made me happy. hehe but yeahhh then we left camp and i was standing out in the parking lot and JON B'S FRIEND yelled...JON LOVES YOU!! so i went and yelled I LOVE YOU TOO JON!! then his friend yelled AND HE THINKS YOUR FINE and then they drove off. hahahahha i thought that was funny. thennnn i slept on the way home after DANCING TO MY MUSIC! haha it was awsome.       &nbsp;    &nbsp;   when i got home my mom took me shopping and i got 2 skirts, capris, a shirt, 2 pairs of shoes, sunglasses, a burse, a belt, and some other things. then we went out for dinner and rented a movie. but about 15 minutes into starsky and hutch we got bored not of the movie but we just didnt want to watch a movie. so i came online and talked to tyler.

      Well, I haven't written in this thing for a few days. I've been really busy. Alright well let's start with...Saturday. Umm I woke up around 7:30 because I had softball games in Canby. We lost our first game and then won our second. After that I came home and talked with Kelsey and we decided to go see The Notebook. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen and also the saddest movie I have ever seen. If you haven't seen it yet...Go. Go see it right now before it's out of theatres. It was funny because the ending is so sad and as we were walking out of the movie, this man is like, "It's alright everyone, don't cry," as he was like crying while he said it. I think almost everyone in the movie cried. But yah, it's a really good movie.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;When I got home I just hung out with myself because Kelsey had to go home because she was going somewhere that evening. Soo yahh I just came home and talked with Angela and other friends. That was my Saturday,     Sunday:::I woke up at like 6 something because we had earlier games that day. We again, lost our first and won our second. We all kind of wanted to loose that first game so we wouldn't have to play 2 games after and if we lost we only had to play 1 more after that. So we didn't really give it our "A" game. Which we could probably beat any team if we all played our "A" game. Everyone on the team is very good. Oh yah and between games me and Hannah went to Subway. I friggin love Subway!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  But yah I got home around 2:30 and I was supposed to hangout with Angela, but she wasn't home and I never got a hold of her. So I hung out with Amy loo and Natalie Fatalie. Wow I love them. My daddy was being soo cool that day and we drove around listening to Rolling Stones. Then we came home and my dad gave us money to go to Baskin Robins. He was in a very good mood that day even though I cried to him to get him to pick up Natalie and Amy. I guess it worked more than I thought, haha. Then we watched Freaky Friday and of course I fell asleep. That's kind of a given when you're with me and we are watching movies.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;After the movie Amy woke me up by getting right in front of my face and yelling...TORI! Hmmmm what a nice way to be woken up. After that we went out and hung out with Chad, Jered, and Mikey. When we saw Mr. Alex Ost and chased him EVERYWHERE! It was a lot of fun. We were singing Jessica Simpson songs. It was so much freaking fun. Thennn I went with Alex and we hung out when we got lost because Jered, Chad, Mikey, Natalie, and Amy were gone. It took us forever to find them. But yahh Alex is one cool guy and I'm gladdd I got to see him because I haven't seen him in forever! Then we went home and ate some food, went online, and just talked. Then we went to bed.  &nbsp;    Now...it's Monday, and I will just type about what happens today later. I love you!

Probably not     That didn't stop him     From wishing that he did     Didn't keep him from wanting     Or worshipping him       &nbsp;   He guesses he saw him     About once a year     He could still feel the way he felt     Standing in tears     Stretching his arms out     As far as they'd go     Whispering daddy     I want you to know       &nbsp;   [Chorus:]     I love you this much     And i'm waiting on you     To make up your mind     Do you love me too?     How ever long it takes     I'm never giving up no matter what     I love you this much       &nbsp;   He grew to hate him for what he had done     'cause what kind of father     Could do that to his son?     He said 'damn you daddy'     The day that he died     The man didn't blink     But the little boy cried       &nbsp;   [Chorus:]     I love you this much     And i'm waiting on you     To make up your mind     Do you love me too?     How ever long it takes     I'm never giving up no matter what     I love you this much       &nbsp;   Half way through the service     While the choir sang a hymn     He looked up above the preacher     And he sat and stared at him       &nbsp;   He said'forgive me father'     When he realized     That he hadn't been unloved     Or alone all his life     His arms were stretched out      As far as they'd go     Nailed to the cross     For the whole world to know       &nbsp;   [Chorus:]     I love you this much     And i'm waiting on you     To make up your mind     Do you love me too?     How ever long it takes     I'm never giving up no matter what     I love you this much       &nbsp;     sad...i love you this much...by jimmy wayne

        alrighty well i'll just talk about yesterday cuz i have nothing else to talk about...i woke up around 8:45 and i had to wait about half an hour for my sisters little friend to come over and wow she took forever when i could have been sleeping, but when she finally did i just went on the computer for a little while. then miles called and i talked to him until my sister got up which was like an hour later. i had to do my sisters hair the most PERFECT FREAKING WAY ANY ONE IN THE WORLD COULD...oh yes and if you didnt...you got the most annoying little girl calling her mommy every 5 seconds and ME getting yelled at and then my sister would throw stuff until god she made me cry i couldnt handle it. thank god we got through it an hour later and now she is a good little sister who i love. but after that i called miles back and talked to him and his cousin like all day while i was labeling these letters for my job. i had to go to the orthodontist after that and they push together the teeth on my retainer so it would move my two front ones together more and god it hurts like hell... it hurts worse than braces when they got tighted so much more wow i almost cried cuz it hurts so bad and i cant take it out its like friggin stuck or something.    After hell i went to softball practice and after practice i went to kelsey house. then i was supposed to call miles again haha but i actually just talked to his cousin taylor which was cool but then me and kelsey watched the sandlot cause umm i brought it and you all know its my favorite movie. after that we fell asleep but we were on the couch and i guess i kicked her off cuz around 1 am she went FLYING OFF THE COUCH holy crap it was hilarious. so we moved to the fruiton or whatever it is and i fell right asleep.   but yeah that was MY day...if it says it was on july 13...it was actualy july 12...im really bored and just wrote about yesterday

GET YOUR SALTY NUTS!" he eventually pissed off some old couple and they had him fired. funny story though. oh by the way the padres lots because they suck but whatever haha. it was a lot of fun though!!     ummm yeah then after a week we drove down to palm springs. we stayed at my grandmas house and my B E A utiful cousin leslie is living with her. so that was tons of fun. we went to go see dodgeball at the dollar theatre. me her and her friend paulina. that was a lot of fun because yeah they are cool and the movie was hilarious.    oh and also i got to see my second cousins...kyle kevin and becky. they are awsome!! we watched saturday night live...the best of will ferrell with them and also erik...one of kyles best friends who is staying with them. it was so funny!! oh and also the family man. thats like one of my favorite shows now!!

NEXT STOP MY THIGHS! you have no idea how incredibly funny this is to me. like at random moments when no one is even talking i will just burst out laughing because that comes to my head. then yeah me and kevin watched it because kyle and erik went to bed and i was being noisy because i kept laughing so hard at it. then we all saw the day after tomorrow at the dollar theatre. it was fun! then yeah i went back to my grandmas.     i got to see one of my favorite cousins/aunts...shannon!! i looove her sooo much we went shopping at the cabazon outlet mall! its HUGEEEE!! well to me at least haha! i got a lot of stuff or kinda but yeah i had a lot of fun!! it was me, her, my mom, my sister, and my grandma. that was a fun day and i dont feel like typing about what all i got because i swear im getting arthrits in my elbows and fingers. yeah dont ask.     but yeah and then my aunt jeanie was at my grandmas almost everyday and i love her so much shes the best!! its like a tradition to play games everytime we are all together. like my mom with any of my aunts! but yeah we played yahtzee. i whooped them all with like a million yahtzees. and for those of you who know the game well...i rolled a ONE ROLL YAHTZEE. yes thats like impossible and i was like amazed when i did roll it. it was with 2's. so yes 2's are lucky acording to ME! haha    then i got to see my really good friend ryan! weve been friends our whole lives because our moms have been friends forever too. so yeah ive known her my whole life. i spent like 3 or 4 nights with her!! i went to church with her on sunday morning and met some of her friends. they were all really nice and i signed up to go on the beach trip on thursday. so we just hung out and watched like 10 movies all together. we watched....little black book, thirteen going on thirty, dude wheres my car, part of HARDBALL, grind, adventures in babysitting, bring it on, enough, rat race(twice), like 15 min of cant buy my love, ummmm save the last dance, wow i know there is more but i cant even remember. then we played ddr...dance dance revolution. i got kinda good at that. it was a lot of fun. ummmm then we went to church on wednesday night and i met more of her friends. more of the guys at least...and after church we went to target randomly because thats what they like to do. and i went with dj, chris, shawn, chaz, and umm i think thats it! then the girls went in another car. i was brave going with the boys all by myself. but anyways chaz drove us to target and we were riding the bikes everywhere and trying in bras that were like bigger than my head and blah blahblah! it was so much fun. me and chaz were running up and down the isles spraying each other with axe mens deoderizer. or whatever hah. me and dj got lost because this lady almost kicked us out and we all just split and left. haha yeah. then after target ryan jade and someone else was in the middle of chaz's jeep thingy and chaz and i think shawn were in the front and me dj and chris were in the trunk. but you should all know what a trunk of a jeep looks like. its like a van trunk. and we were "offroading" to another neighborhood behind target. thats where i think ryan and jade went back into the car with the girls. and somehow we were back to where we all were in the beginning and we put in cool! music. you know music everyone likes late at night. like you know ying yang twins and them people. people that make me hyper and wanna run around and dance. and well thats what i did. with everyone else in the car too. except not run around. we just danced...a lot. hah. then we went to Dj's ex-girlfriends house and chaz banged on her window and ran back to the car and we went FLYING down the road. it was so awsome. yeah then we went to this one other store and somehow went to carls jr? but anyway we were sitting there and dj put salt in his napkin and the manager came over and shes like you need to leave and were like what? and shes like DID I STUDDER?! LEAVE RIGHT NOW! and dj's like why? and she took his napkin and salt spilled everywhere and hes like...hmmm where did that come from? anyways we left laughing and then we went downtown palm springs and walked around and listened to COOL! music. haha. then me and ryan went home at 10:30 because we had to wake up at 6:45 the next morning to go to the beach with the same people we had been with all night!    so the next morning we woke up and got ready...it only took me like 10 min to get ready but took ryan FOREVER! haha but yeah then we got to the church and me, jade, valerie, and umm omg i forget the other two peoples names but yeah we all rode in the car, and the guys all went in another. it was so funny because at a stoplight one of the guys would get out of the car and run around all the other cars at the stoplight and then they would get locked out and yeah it would turn green and then would eventually get back in. haha. ryan (the boy) hes like a youth person at their church...he would let them do ANYTHING! lucky little boys. yeah then these surfer guys were checkin us out when we were at stoplights. it was awsome! haha. anyways the water at the beach...get this you oregon people...you could SWIM in it...without getting COLD! that was so amazing to me. i was like startled. really i mean you COULD go swimming at the coast here if you really wanted to freeze your BUTT off but yeah i dont like to and i didnt have to at the huntington beach there. but first we went shopping a little bit then we went out in the water!! and at one point me, dj, and chris got too far out and i could barely come back in because my knee was hurting and most of you know i have a bad knee and yeah they almost had to come save me but i got to the shore surely but slowly. then dj was cold and he kept holding his wittle boobies so i gave him my shirt to wear because i thin you had to have like a spaghetti strap over your bikini or something i wasnt sure. but yeah and he tried it on and it was umm a little TOO tight and too small. go figure. haha. but yeah then i put it back on myself.    thennnnnn i was hanging out with john. hes really awsome but unfortuneatly doesnt have aim because hes a loser. haha im kidding. but yeah he doesnt which sucks. then we went to in n out which was ALSO right by KRISPY KREAM. or maybe its KRISPY CREAM? yeah WHATEVER haha but it was very good and they gave us free donuts. then we left but the boys were so far ahead that when we got back to the church i didnt get to say goodbye. it was very sad for me. but they all have aim and the phone and yeah im going to visit them all soon!! or hopefully!!     and now i miss RYAN! AND JADE AND CHRIS AND SHAWN AND DJ AND JOHN AND VALERIE AND CHAZ. oh wow. lots of people i miss. there are more. not just them but them the most. sorry everyone else. oh and of course my family. i always miss them when im not with them! but hey that was my vacation! it was so much fun. probably the best one i have had in YEARS! or in my entire life! there are so many inside jokes and stuff i feel like i have with everyone i wouldnt be able to type them all out!     when we were leaving i cried for over 2 hours. yes thats how much i love palm springs. its like home. actually its more home than stupid ass oregon will ever.      but whatever.     i guess im kinda glad to be here at my house..         i take that back.     im not.     the only good thing in oregon are a few good/best friends of mine. you know who you are. dont friggin cry because im not naming you all.     but yeah i have tutoring this week with mrs. lyons...some of you know who she is...for algebra.      and im REALLY tired because i just got back from a TWO friggin day drive and well yeah i still have to unpack and blah blah blah. i dont wanna think about everything i have to do before school starts. plus i have this little thing on the side of my stomach. it hurts and it looks like cancer. its scary. i hope it goes away. haha. and then i noticed i have these little spots on me whenever i scratch my knee. its weird. haha.     yeah im like delerious or something im so tired. and i dont understand myself. im done babbling on and on so why dont i get off!! i dont know. but whatever. im going to now. i love you all. and yeah the only reason you probably read this was because you were SUPER BORED! haha COOL!!       nighty night
