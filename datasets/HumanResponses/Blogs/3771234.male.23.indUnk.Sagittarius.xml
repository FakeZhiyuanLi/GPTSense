      Listening to: RHCP - I could have lied (live)             : Blue Oyster Cult - Don't fear the reaper  what is one to do? met this girl the other day... Shara. well I actually met her a while back, but was too drunk (and on mushrooms) to notice. Breece's friend. pashed the other night. She's one of the best kissers i've ever experienced. anyway, talked to her today and she has a bad feeling (which she always gets). will save you the long version that she gave me. meh.  wrote this the last time i was having Phe issues.  Whenever we kiss I can't sleep till daylight, Sit alone and wonder about my life. The things that come when you aren't waiting, Not gonna happen is just a line.  I know, That you aren't waiting for me. I can, feel your arms on anothers skin. The place, You miss and the touch i crave today. You Speak, So softly from that golden place.  The One, Who lives next door and holds my hand. This could, be the end of a lover or a friend. I Find, A place you never even knew you had. Too much, Just like a pair and I don't know where this will end.   nice.  i just don't understand.

      Its such a delicate thing.   takes years to build. easily destroyed in one fowl swoop.   Its true that i've betrayed the trust of everyone i've ever been really close to. marco. grant. natalie. phe. you name them, i've betrayed them. and their trust.   get to know me, and I'll betray you too.   she made it so i couln't find her blog ever again. she's "technomological". good for her. I know i betrayed her. by reading it, but for fuck's sake. thanks for the vote of confidence. its not like she actually knows i'm as much of a dick as i am. surely not.   whatever.  i don't really deserve any real friends most of the time.   what do i want to do? or be? not doing things to be sombody, but just doing the things i enjoy. what do i really enjoy? i have no idea. when i find things i do enjoy, i'm mocked for them... i will do those things to excess, as always. but i need to find a part of the core me to just be. and to just do.  did that make any sense? no? oh well.

      why do i do it to myself???  over and over again, the only thing that can make Frank feel less sexy is the occasional straight-out ridicule. not even subtle behind-the-back mocking couln't produce this form of self loathing.   $400... she offered. why do i think its going to be mutual??? i have no idea. i run out of strength so easily. and no one can take it like Phe. its like she has a perfectly designed proboscis to dock with my heart... just sucks the nectar out each and every time.   each and every time i think she might just let herself go and realise that it could be great.   I'm the sap. Can't blame her. she's both doing what she thinks i want, and getting some action. I blame me.   either way, I have another scar to remind me that all is not as it seems. to remind me that I can control myself, even if its only to the path of destruction. I have to control something.   "I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't screw to save its species. I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all the French beaches I'd never see. I wanted to breathe smoke."  "I felt like destroying something beautiful."  Frank

      ...but, you know, like, whatever.   So i feel like i should write a "the story so far" paragraph or 2... but i won't. It would turn into pages, and i frankly can't be arsed.   so i shall instead just let you guys (assuming anyone's reading this) figure it out as you go along.   OK... people always do this, so I'll be a sheep and do it:  Currently listening to:  Wise up janet weiss from the rocky horror show. perfect day - lou reed Currently thinking: Why does susie have to be maybe pregnant? why does phe think of me so poorly. currently should be doing: bank stuff.  read a friend's blog (my best mate from the better part of high school... as if there was a "better" part of high school) http://canblog.blogspot.com about his move to canberra from sydney.  this is motivated as much by that and other blogs (housemates, their frineds, other high school friends, my ex-wife) as it is by my desife to have a record of my thoughts that can't be so easily lost, destroyed or otherwise messed with.   listening to: tuesday by you am I.  Phe... she was, and possibly is my best friend, but i'm feeling more and more detached from her lately. I wish I could just feel semi-ambivolent. but i can't. it seems love or hate is all i'm capible of. embrace apathy.  listening to: Van Morrison - Brown eyed girl.  Going to queensland on the 7th of july. I'm so fucking poor, but i'm spending a grand i don't have to go to qld with her... just so we can chill together. it won't happen that way. nothing's ever as good as you can imagine it. it will turn into a bitch fest. I can feel it in my bones. deserted island. i'm so sick of not knowing how to deal with her.   listening to: Jimmy barnes and the badloves - the weight. cover of the song by "the band". the first song i ever sung in public.   picked up my bags and went looking for a place to hide. yeah, thats about right. but then you find new things to hide from.  I'd like to stay a secret Like walking in the dark If no one knows you no one cares so no one breaks your heart.  thats on susie's wall. her sentiment, not mine. i'm shagging susie. thats about what you would call it. lovers... maybe. definately not my girlfriend. but i do care for her a great deal. we're getting closer every time we see each other, which is great, but i always feel like she's about to flip out. like she's about to just go and say "no".  listening to: Green eyes by coldplay.  Why do all the girls i love have green eyes?   more to follow. but do check out these blogs:  http://dinky-creek.diaryland.com http://goblind.blogspot.com http://canblog.blogspot.com  Frank.

      Chuck Palahniuk.  "if you're going to read this, don't bother. After a couple of pages, you won't want to be here. So forget it. Go away. Get out while you're still in one piece. Save yourself. There has to be something better on television. Or since you  have so much time on your hands, maybe you could take a night course. Become a doctor. You could make soumething of your- self. Treat yourself to a dinner out. color your hair.  You're not getting any younger.  What happens here is just going to piss you off. After that it just gets worse and worse."  how good is chuck.  chuck is da man.   this is about the 3rd time i've read "Choke", and its still going strong.  need nicotine.   need MDMA.  need THC.  need sleep.  need pizza... well it would be nice.  need burn cream (i.e. metho)  oh, so smashed.  aaaahhh, nicotine.   better.  phe. why can't i forget her.   does anyone read this?  doesn't matter, i guess.  bye then.

      susie's not pregnant.   it actually makes me feel a bit wierd. i almost wanted the tragedy of that kind of experience to bring us closer.  I told you I was a shit.   but i'm glad overall, i guess.  she's fucking good.  deb's back from NZ... should I re:shag?   dunno.  will let you know.  oh, and call me paranoid if you like, (and I am) but i'm sure that phe and professor manchild have been more intimate than she's letting on.  hmmmmmmm.

      So, So, So, So, So, So, So, So, So, So, so.  you've decided to join us???   how nice.  Listening to: michael jackson : beat it.  so fucking stoned. no, seriously.  Heard from hell bitch today.  her story (readers digest version) is that i met her after the melbourne uni law ball. @ 7 night club in sth melbourne. nice.   so she's actually pretty cool. but she's going over to  europe and whatnot for 7 months.   ok.  so i get a call from her one night that says "i need a service, come and pick me up". ok. so i call and make sure.   i'm sick of talking about this converstion (extra points for noticing the zoolander reference before you read it here) now.  phe is nearly bearing wonderboy's childeren. wonderboy is our new housemate.he does everything i do, but better. great. phe can somehow give him all the physuval affection in the world on him, or anyonre,m but not me?!?!  i am jealous, i guess.  listening to: jimi hendrix - all along the watchtower.  much better than the bob dylan version.  did i mention how fucking stoned i am?  way, man.  way stoned.  fucking phe. i lover her to bits... to fucking much, i guess.  later, Phrarnq

       With each passing moment you become more my slave.     With each passing moment, it seems more and more like she was never here.  Mr Cainer said:    Never mind what you are wearing. Who cares where you live? Why should we be interested in your social status? There's only one thing that matters. The amount of love in your heart. The amount of sympathy, compassion, understanding, generosity, warmth and kindness. If you've got that, you are rich. If you want to be richer, get more of it. And if there's a shortage of hope in your heart or light in your eyes, the rest is irrelevant, no matter how much you have. Venus and Jupiter today, are blessing you with a commodity more precious than platinum: inspiration.      inspiration. thats good, i guess. i need some. spoke to the hot poppy crew, and they're up for the cheap speed i'll be bringing back from sydney.  later F

      Ok.  So.  Thinking about everything, and reading too much computer monitor text has made me sleepy.  I miss Phë.  Not just in the “she’s not here” sense, but in the fact that we, I just realized, haven’t actually had a good laugh or any fun without a “state of the friendship” talk being associated with it for a long time. A long long time indeed. I never know about these sorts of things, but maybe we’ve plain old run out of things to say. She’s not back from Flinders with Dr wonderful yet, so who knows what’s been going on down there.  I found this that I wrote quite a while ago, which I thought I’d Share.   18/04/2004  Hi there.  Its been a while. So much has happened since the last time we spoke. To start with, I’m divorced. Happened the day before yesterday. We had a party at rrose for the occasion, which some would call strange. I felt so odd. I was truly happy at the time, but you know, things like that can go either way. Brooke, Ty, Phë, Breece, Kaitlen (and her new squeeze Ash) were there, as were most of the notable cast of north Melbourne regulars. But a notable absence was Susie. She was probably quite uncomfortable with the idea of the guy she was seeing inviting her to his divorce party. Its not what could ever be called non-freaky experience. She’s a kinda cool chick. She’s a Gemini, so I will end up being sick of her shit in the very soon time unless I take it pretty easy. She “doesn’t do the couple thing”. I never get that. My understanding is that if you find someone good, you don’t need to make rules for yourself. Live life. Not to “choose life”, but to live it, whatever it is. Wherever you find it. Adventure of whatever kind you can muster.  Anyway, so Brooke tells me how sexy I looked, and asks me where my pickup was. I had no pickup, and to tell you the truth, I was hoping it would be Brooke herself that would be sharing my bed that night. But she and Ty seem to be on the right course. This is a very good thing. She needs someone who will love her but give her the independence she needs. I hope it can be him. He’s a great guy, from all I can tell.  Anyway, I don’t know what might happen with Phë. It all started in Sydney. Oh, we went to Sydney through the week, where we tried to find somewhere to go on a Wednesday night, only to end up in king’s cross. Classy. We made a pact that we couldn’t leave the place without pashing someone. So we gave up when it sucked and just pashed each other. Such a good kisser. Something I will re: Susie, she may be pretty good in bed, but she is too rough. I’ve always seen sex as 2 separate entities. Couple sex, and fuck sex. Biting and beatings are fine during fuck sex, but not anywhere near as good as a great couple sex experience. That said its still the best sex I’ve had in years. Maybe Natalie…its hard to remember that the past isn't black and white. Oh, she had the baby, which I saw in Sydney. They are soooooo cute. Amazing little thing he is. She seems so removed from the woman I married. So… I don’t know, beaten? So we’re in kings cross. We decide to go for a drive somewhere with a view. Vaucluse was chosen. Such a great view just near Doyle’s there. Kissing, wrist. Such great breasts. She said that “we’re so coupley already that to sleep together would make us together”. This might well be true. I wouldn’t mind so much, but she is looking forward to matt, and to tell you the truth, I’m looking forward to meeting him and seeing her get bored. All things come to those who wait. Not. But nothing’s over until you’re dead. And if there is one thing I’ve learned from the last year, its that I’m far from dead nowadays. I was close for a long, long time, but I’m back baby. Back from the brink.  So I’m not sure what to do about the Susie situation. Haven’t called her today, but that does tend to happen. Might wait for her to call me. That’s not crazy, right? People who like people call them once in a while, right???  Meh.   Yeah… a note on a couple of points there… Susie and I are at exactly the same place we were. How surprising. 4 months of stagnation. I disagree with my Natalie sentiment, in as much as she’s much more like I remember her in the last couple of weeks. Since we’ve been speaking again, that is. It was almost easier to believe that the woman I married was completely dead and gone, and that some weaker and more easily dominated body-snatcher had taken her place. But that’s not the case. Still, I'm Glad to have her back.  Listening to: Pearl Jam – Daughter.  Not everyone knows that pearl jam is a euphemism for semen. Think about it. What would pearl flavoured jam look like? There you have it.  Phë is just one of those things I guess. I’m eventually going to have to get used to not having her around. I’m very much thinking about moving out. I don’t know what I was thinking when I decided to move in (oh, yeah, 4 crazy Irish living in my old house), but moving out may just give me the opportunity to salvage some of our friendship for a later date.  My decision at the moment is to just try and be as nonchalantly superficial as possible. She’ll notice, as she always does when I’m acting in any way weird, but that’s not my intention. I just want some distance.  Listening to: Dandy Warhols – The last high  My horoscope today:   We can think of a few: Nelson Mandella; Bob Geldof; Mother Teresa. Noble souls who have struggled courageously to help make this world a better place. Are they really the only ones? How come then, that we can all reel off a long list of soap stars, rock stars and film stars yet if we try to remember the great and the good, we soon run out of famous names. What does that say about our world? Wonderful, loving, kind, giving actions are rarely applauded, but always rewarded. Don't expect praise today for a kind gesture. But do rest assured it is the right move to make.   Thank you very much Jonathan Cainer. Lots of help.  I really had no opportunity to do anything “Wonderful, loving, kind, giving” today. If I did, I would have. I did go to Centrelink. Does that count? They have these mats indicating where you’re supposed to stand. Just has the logo and says “pleases queue here” or words to that effect. I really want to steal one. I want one for my front door.  Listening to: RHCP: Throw away your television.  At Centrelink I ran into Rachel. She’s my old housemate who now works there. When I last saw her, about a year ago, we had just shagged (after she moved out, I’m not that hypocritical) and she was in a really fucking weird headspace. She needed to find a place for her life to go, and I didn’t really have the strength or wisdom to help her, as much as I wanted to. She had been a major high-flyer in a London investment bank and had been in positions of serious authority, responsibility and pay-cheque. She then took a year off to look after her grandmother and things didn’t work out as planned. She was broke, unemployed, etc… she moved into 417 with Tim. I moved in a few months later. Last time we spoke, she was working in Centrelink, had no life or interests to speak of and was feeling really shocking about herself. Anyway, she’s right back on track, doing 3 days per week at Centrelink and doing a psychology degree at Melbourne Uni. Got herself a boyfriend (another housemate, so I declined to mention the Phë situation).  Listening to: darkness – Friday night.  If you don’t have the darkness – permission to land, go and get yourself a copy, available at all good record stores.  Rach and I had a really good chat over lunch and are both happy that we did. I still don’t know how I’m supposed to make a kind gesture today, no one is home. I’ve encountered no one. Is a gesture by definition an un-requested action? Does a gesture need to be spontaneous? Can it be a nicer action than you would have normally taken to a given stimulus? I’ve been reading too much fucking philosophy lately. Everything is a question on a question on a question. No answers. Philosophy, the search for truth, my arse. I love it, but it does not provide truth, or answers without a pre-determined social construct, if you believe Nietzsche.  Phë’s not coming home tonight. It would appear.  Get used to it.   This is your life, and its ending one minute at a time .  So that’s kinda that then.  I did a silly thing.  Listening to: Delta Goodrem – Lost without you.  How ironic. Not in the Alanis Morrissette way, but in the much more relevant way.  I commented on goblind.blogspot.com using my usual blogger account. This means that when Phë notices the “1 comments” on a recent post and reads it (which she will) she will be easily lead straight here.  I could go and delete the comment, but I don’t want to. If you’re reading this, good for you. Turnaround is fair play I suppose. PS nice work on using that Blog patrol add in. I only noticed because it of the cookies it wanted to send me. I use it too. So nyeh. Shouldn’t you be shagging Dave??? Go on then, chop, chop. Finish in his hair. If you finish. Which you won’t, because captain wonderful isn’t generally known as captain magic hands, now is he???  Anyway, now that that’s out of the way, I was onto some kind of train of thought, wasn’t I?  If you finish a sentence in an I in word, it doesn’t do an autocorrect because of the punctuation directly after it. Just noticed. I wonder how often that actually comes up?  Listening to – Pink Floyd – Wish you were here.  Why is winamp doing its darndest to make me feel bad?  So, the Olympics.  I’m already sick of them.  Kill me. I beg you. I used to live in sunny Sydney. During the 2000 games, when everyone else (read: all of the former detractors) “got in the Olympic spirit”, I remained firmly…    Did you exchange a walk on part in a war for a lead role in a cage?    I love great lyrics like that. That just makes me think of Natalie. When I was at my lowest last year this song came on gold 104 (classic hits station in Melbourne) and I just burst into tears.  … grinch-like. I hated the Olympics then, as I do now. Sure, everyone likes a dash of sport (don’t get me started about AFL), but 2 fucking weeks solid? Of table tennis, synchronized swimming and kayaking? I can see them televising the track, swimming, maybe weight-lifting and gymnastics… the stuff that’s kinda interesting, or that we might win, but come on. Who the fuck knows who’s winning in the judo? And how do you judge diving? Have you noticed that the cats who are judging the diving (and most stuff) tend towards the stereotype of short, official looking types with thick glasses. I’ll say that again. Thick glasses. They’re judging at an Olympic level and they have vegemite jar glasses. Anyway, I had (have?) a t-shirt that was all black with large white lettering on the front that said “  FUCK THE OLYMPICS  ”. I wish I could find it. This is going on for soooooooooo looooong.  Listening to: RHCP – I could have lied.  This is kina a long blog, but like, you know, whatever.  I hope someone out there is reading at least some of it. I’m not sure how much I’d need to censor if I gave the address to too many people. Do I want this to be a place of free expression and relative anonymity or of veiled thoughts and acclaim? I’m sure that question will answer itself in time. My ego and self-importance will no doubt get the better of me and I’ll tell all and sundry about it.  Well I’ve been writing about fuck all for about an hour now, and my back is sore and I need to go and have a smoke. I really should quit. I know I can be a quitter. Being a quitter and sticking with it. Now there’s a concept.  Keep your bananas at 13 degrees, Frank.

      The professor is even better at being a wanker than me.  ok, get this, so I'm in his room today (non-nefarious reasons... You can be sure of that) and I come across tooth-whitening gel... That's the winner in my opinion. The top-shelf, first-prize winner of his PhD in poontangicity.  ok, I've toyed with the notion of tooth-whitening gel myself, some of my friends have, no doubt, used it to great effect. But this is just one more in a long list of things that indicate to me that he's just trying to make up for something. Not in a small penis, Lord Faarquad from Shrek kinda way, but in a deep-seated self loathing kinda way.  I know, I know, I'm the last one to talk. If you've read any of the rest of my posts, you'll know that in some ways, I'm no doubt in the same boat. But there is trying to improve yourself, and then there's obsession.  Having a shoe collection to rival Immelda marcos' and enough CDs to bee seen from the moon if layed end-to-end    does not    make you a better person, or more attractive to the opposite sex. All the gear in the world will not make you better at what you're using it for. Granted, he's good at a lot of stuff, but he comes off as having a need to own items of youth status. Or status items of the youth.  Not sure if I'm explaining it properly. Not items that indicate his status as a youth, rather items that make him have status in the culture of youth, as opposed to middle aged status objects. he has many DVDs as opposed to a BMW.  These do not help him. Any more than that kind of thing helps anyone. Even me.   Sticking feathers in your butt does not make you a chicken.   Getting a manicure does not magically make you know how to find a clitoris.  More to follow.   Franky McFrankster Hooligan Funkster Extraordinaire   (That last one was just a dig at his belief (rumor has it) that the most pleasurable place to rub a woman is somewhere in her inner-thigh or on her pubic hair) see  urlLink http://www.the-clitoris.com  for more information.

      No money and no phe make Frank something something.  Go crazy?  Don't mind if I do.  Yesterday was a shite day, but I had a great rehearsal, and Brooke helped. Brooke always helps. She's such an "always there" friend. She'll drop anything and everything to be there for you, no matter what the situation.  More importantly than that, she'll ask for and graciously accept even when not asked for, help. Sound like anyone I live with? Not really. Not at all. She'll help, but part of me and part of what I value in friendship is the ability to not just lean, but to be leant on whenever each other needs it. I never feel lonely with Brooke, even if I have been feeling so all day. I feel needed.  Anyway, I'm not sure what the phe situation will be when she gets back from flinders.  as an aside, I just found porn, and the "below the neck" section is susie's doppelganger. Cool.  yeah, she said she's be back this arvy (love that australianism), but haven't seen her yet. Anyway, I'm sure it will be cold, frosty and numb, cold as the hairs on a polar bear's... Holy shit, I'm turning into my father.  so, I'm doing nothing tonight. Might just bog away all night. I know that the lovely Natalie is reading this now, so at least someone gets the pleasure of my company.  Frank is such a great pseudonym.  Frankus O'Irish

      so there it is.  phe and the professor are together.  I wish i was needed by someone. i wish my life made a difference. i wish i wasn't walking in the dark.  something tells me i'll walk in the dark until i can be happy for myself. without support, without others.   I'd like to stay a secret,   Like walking in the dark,   If no one knows you,   No one cares, so   No one breaks your heart.     I used to wonder how people could live their lives like that. Wonder how they could believe they need no one. but its a special person indeed who won't fuck you over. who won't find something somewhere better, as it were.  having dinner with brooke soon, then rehearsal.  at least i've got some new stuff for rehearsal. an artist has to suffer for his art, after all.

      does anyone out there remember sim city 2000? the arcologies you could build, and the freakiest of them all known as a darko?  anyway, i think of that each and every time i think of the movie donnie darko.  little things make me sad.   when i saw that there was a director's cut coming out, i immediately thought of seeing it with phe. but of course, the professor got in first and is seeing it with her. i don't have a place.   on out way out tonight, i asked if "the Zoe monster" was home. phe said that HER name was monster. I had a remark on the tip of my toungue that would have gone like "it sucks to be replaced"... but i didn't bother. she's been in there every night. she talks to him constantly when he's around. she sleeps there.   i just miss my friend.   i can't make her want to hang with me, and i wouldn't want to. if she wants to devote all her spare time to him, then thats her decision, not mine, and i have no right to enforce my wishes on her.   i just wish that she wanted to do things with me. i was the flavour of the month for a year or so, and it looks like our friedship is now waning. makes me numb to think of it. i have no more feeling left.   she says he needs her help, and tells me about how upset he is. sucks to be in demand i suppose, but i need her too. i only moved here to be close to her, and its slipping away. i tried to tell her the other night, but it went in one ear and out the other. i wouldn't tell her for ages on wednesday, but she kept asking. i eventually relented and told her. she said how sweet it was, and explained that dave needs her. nothing has changed.   nothing will change.   I really believe that these things are defined as they were at the onset. we will not become any more than we are. contract work does not become permenant. my contract is coming to a close, it would seem.  she doesn't seem to get it, and i'm running out of energy.

      ok.  So i've gone and done the thing i always do when i write. i have done nothing for a month, which will soon be followed by a burst for a few days.  great.  Listening to: Led Zeppelin - Going to California from Led Zep 2  Went to california... ahhh... Queensland. One of the most beautiful places i've been, but it could have been better if everything wasn't so platonic. well, so semi-platonic. read about 7 books in those 2 weeks, which has been a great thing for me. getting back into reading after a couple of month lul.  quit smoking. i'm up to my 8th quit. who said i wasn't a quitter. smoking again now though.  Listening to: Jurassic 5 - twelve.  phe and the professor of perfection (dave, the new housemate for you new readers) have been together and are now "just friends".  the very phrase "just friends" sums up my opinion of it. If friends were "just as important as any relationship can be" as phe suggests, then why would the word "just" be a requiremant? there would be equality between friends and other.  But it doesn't work that way. Plato was a dick.  Listening to: SomewhereInSummer - Dave's Trip.  Great guys, somewhereinsummer. live in sydeny, met them in melbourne. anyway, i've met, slept with, and otherwise been in contact with numerous new persons recently.  Natalie: new enough. my ex-wife. she and i haven't talked in so long that when she emailed me the other day it felt new. Jess: Met at the public office. a club / warehouse in west melbourne. hot. VCA dancer. some ugly chick: pased @ warfey(my housemate)'s 21st on saturday. Barnsey's girlfriend: how do people with the personality of a sack of wet mice and a look that screams "kill me" get hot red-deaded chicks? Josh: susie's bro. didn't meet recently, but i haven't mentioned him. he's a better friend than susie... scary. rose: stand up, mushroom picking bitch.  and others, who i am too lazy to type about.  phe.  I know when she stays in dave's room, because its the only time his door is ever locked. i came down this morning in an attempt to go to work (failed) and saw it closed, but his car missing. she has promised (not that i asked her to) that phe and dave as a couple is over. she just doesnt get that is not sleeping with each other that is the real problem, but that its the intimate connection. she almost had me believing her rhetoric about us being so close and whatnot, but i don't feel close to her so much of the time. she takes a part of me.  Makes me wonder why i bother, Makes me wonder why i try. Takes a part of me to be part of her, none of me knows why.  Does it smell like smoke in here, and will i miss another year, or lay down with a bottle in my bed. Is it really so hard to find, Monster's mound, the captain's slime, Or sign my desk with passion, superted.  Does my finger paint in red, can't feel sexy, try bored instead, having magic doesn't make the world a better place. quick stopover on your way home, revelations in your tone, detail is beauty's worst disgrace.  I wrote that about both phe and susie. try to figure out which verse is about who. and, yes, the first line of the second verse is an homage to "purple stain" by RHCP.  Josh, susie's bro is so calm. a real calming influence on my life. went to public office with hime last friday. thats where i met jess. is it wierd to be making out (manually) with a girl (dancer, gemini, curly blonde, green eyes (there's that green eyed girl thing again)) while the brother of the girl you're seeing dances not 3 metres away? yeah... as cool as everyone is, its strange to me.  My band seem to be getting serious. our new stuff is fucking great.  maybe i'm biased, but i can't wait to get up and do some gigs with these guys. getting to be great friends with adam and annalee, and we are playing with (and putting out tszuj on) the songs more and more. and i occasionally get to cut sick guitar style. nice.  overall, i'm feeling much better than i did when i started this blog, but the phe / dave thing is still fresh.  she has tonsilitis. she gets it alot. I personally don't know why she doesn't just get them removed. anyway, she was really sick last night... need someone there. went to dave's room... not mine. slept in his bed.  does she not trust me, or what? just don't understand why she never feels comfortable around me, despite her claims of our intimate bond. I really do feel replaced. superceeded. The whole situation reeks of natalie and Laughing boy. Laughing boy (aka dr laughsalot) is the father of natalie's baby... and a dick. thats all i have to say about that.  so easily replaced, my position filled.  you are not special. you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. you are the same decaying organic matter as everything else. we are all a part of the same compost heap.  i know that this isn't the case with natalie, but its how it felt for a year or so. lets be honest, till a few days ago when she emailed me. I don't know how to tell her anymore, but i love her more than i've loved anyone in my life. and its still my greates regret. I hope to christ i find someone half as perfect for me as she was... is.  anyway, i'm off to smoke something.  anyone got any crack.  Franky Frank break it down.  PS - the half-way house bogans in number 31 offered to sell me a couple of stolen jackets (puffy, wegro style)... so i offered to sell them a stolen LCD monitor. reminded me of that scene in Jay and silent bob strike back where the crack dealers try to sell them crack (der) and they counter by trying to sell the crack guys weed... both parties producing their drug-dealer union card. i felt like we had a common bond.
