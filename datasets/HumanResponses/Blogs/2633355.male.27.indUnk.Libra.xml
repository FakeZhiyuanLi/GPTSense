      Are you tied down? I can say quite honestly at times I feel this way. This is a real feeling that is part of being human. Some may happily skip through an entire lifetime devoid of this feeling, but that does not make them lucky, or any better off. Our reaction to the feeling of being "tied down" can shape how we live out the rest of our days. I have a child, a 55 hour per week job, a mortgage payment, car payment, etc., etc. At times it can be overwhelming. But at the same time, my daughter is what gets me to work every day, what keeps the bills getting paid. The realization that I can do whatever I want at any time if I have but the courage to make a choice is what keeps my heart pumping. We have but one life here. To live without making yourself happy makes life pointless. Know that everybody feels tied down at some point. It doesn't mean we must always feel this way. Life is an ongoing struggle, filled with moments of unprecedented joys and heartbreaks. Life is a hodgepodge of good and bad. Concentrating on the bad will only bring more of it. So it is of the strictest importance that during times of difficulty, know that there are plenty of good times yet to be had.

        Postmodern. Does anyone really know what that word means? Every individual has his or her own way to define it, which is the best definition I've been able to find. The postmodern, from one view (mine), can be likened to a loss of autonomy, or that exuberant sense of self that makes me me and you you. America was forced to find an all-encompassing culture to fit the "needs" of all cultures that have flocked here. The "culture industry" has formed as a result of this. An industry that grasps the "it" thing of the moment, bleeds it dry, and moves on to the next. We have a tendency to allow ourselves to be treated as infants, to let those with inexhaustable resources do the thinking for us. The less the masses think for themselves, the more they depend on someone else. The industry thrives on this. The masses are an assembly line, waiting to be programmed, to be told what's cool, so they can have an identity.    The irony lies in the fact that in a truly postmodern society, there is no identity. The moment one attempts to stand out, he/she is admitting the culture industry has control. Attemtping to be original in any aspect (art, fashion, architecture, etc.) is owning up to the fact that the industry has significantly affected one's life. Sometimes people consciously choose an identity in an attempt to stand apart from the system and are consequently sucked right back into the system they are seeking to avoid. People acknowledge the power of the system by choosing a way to live to attempt to break free from it. Mass media is largely to blame. We are battered so frequently with images that we start to lose all sense of reality. When anyone can become famous, thanks to the advent of reality television, we start associating reality with reality on T.V. It seems entertainment has become reality and reality has become entertainment.   Think back to 9/11. An unprecedented coverage war downplayed a devastating moment in history. The media exhaustion lessened the effect of a truly horrible event. We turned to cable when the networks were carrying yet another tribute to the fallen. We know it was bad, we don't need to be reminded. How long ago does it seem that Nixon was ousted? The Clinton scandal? Frederic Jameson said, "one is tempted to say that the very function of the news media is to relegate such recent historical experiences as rapidly as possible into the past." We had a one month memorial service, six month, one year, two year. How many times must we be reminded? Some might say so we won't forget. How could we possibly forget such an event? Give the public the credit it deserves.    Thedor Adorno, an accepted expert on the postmodern, believes our one saving grace is our deeply seeded, unconscious mistrust of the culture industry. Whether we acknowledge it our not, we all know that we are buying into a system of empty promises. The rich want to get richer, and the poor definitely want to get richer. Being rich or wanting to be rich is not bad in and of itself. But promising something you have no right to promise, such as a thinner waist, a twelve step program to defeating depression, ten ways to become a millionaire, is no way to get rich. If you promise something, follow through. People want the truth, even if they don't say so.   I see more today of people searching for a way to break this trend. But they are people I physically meet, not those seen on a screen. The people are ready. The solution does not lie in a collective effort, for then we would be creating yet another industry. Everyone must do their own thing in their own way. If it is not original or unique, think of who is telling you it is not original or unique. What gives them any right to place judgment on your life? We must all do what innately comes to us, and we must never, ever apologize.

        We all want to be famous and adored, or at least noticed, on some level. This is me attempting to get noticed. Does what I have to say mean anything to you? How the fuck should I know? Do I really care? Or am I too busy trying to get noticed? The truth is, I do care, and I do want to get noticed. Why can't we have the best of both worlds? I want to help you and get recognized while I do it. We are all here together, nobody is any more wise than anybody else, so why pretend that anything anybody says is more important than what you have to say?    You are what's important in your life. Don't listen to some arrogant ass on a blog that thinks he has answers. There are no answers. Life is unique to every individual, and his answers will be warped accordingly. Trust your own views and thoughts. Go for what you want out of life, not what you think everybody else expects out of you. Fuck everyone else, you are all that matters.

      Sometimes I'm more than I thought I could be, and sometimes I'm less. Sometimes I prefer to be alone, others the center of attention. Sometimes I watch NBA basketball, sometimes I write in solitude. Sometimes I'll talk without thinking, sometimes I won't say anything at all. Sometimes I don't want what I have, other times I feel fortunate. Sometimes I want to die, sometimes I want to live.  Life. It is what it is. Sometimes you get it, and sometimes you don't.

      I am somebody, even though you don't know me. I exist even though you cannot hear me talk, see me eat, or watch me write. I am referencing you even though I do not know your name or even your gender. Who I am, what I stand for, what I've accomplished, who I know, why I am doing this is of no importance to you, and yet you read this still.  There is nothing of significance here, no inspiring words, no encouraging thoughts. I cannot give you advice, nor wish to take any. I have nothing to offer you. And yet you read on.  You do not know what I do for a living, why I started this blog, or what I want to get across, but something is keeping you here. Something says, "If I keep reading it will make sense."   This entry is of complete insignificance, of no importance, but you are looking for something, for some point. Why?

      When I was a kid, I ate KELLOGG'S Corn Flakes for breakfast nearly every morning. I'd douse every spoonful with sugar, much to the dismay of my mother. I think she was just jealous because I got a bigger buzz from my KELLOGG'S Corn Flakes than she did from her FOLGER'S Crystals. Sometimes her FOLGER'S Crystals caused her left arm to jiggle. I would laugh as I ate my KELLOGG'S Corn Flakes and she would get so pissed. She would hold her cup of FOLGER'S Crystals in her right hand and point her jiggly finger at me as I heaped another spoonful of KELLOGG'S  Corn Flakes into my mouth. I'd say, "Who you pointin' at, Ma?" as her finger would point first at me, then my bowl of delicious KELLOG'S Corn Flakes, then the dog, then the ceiling. She just couldn't keep that thing steady. "Maybe you should cut down on the FOLGER'S Crystals", I'd say. "You look like you have Parkinson's." Then we'd both laugh with our mouths full of KELLOGG'S Corn Flakes and FOLGER'S Crystals. That's when I knew the government was on to us.

      Success to a child is not wetting the bed. Success to a teen is finding one's purpose in life. Success to an adult is the accumulation of money. Success to the middle aged is finding one's purpose in life. Success to the elderly is not wetting the bed.  Is it any wonder that there is no greater joy than witnessing the interaction of a child and its grandparent? They are not bothered by trivialities.

      ﮒﺌﺏﺺﺛ ﺡﺇﺉﷲﺋﮓﯽﺓﺔﺖﺞ  (click title for intriguing link)  The mind conceptualizes thought in a subject-object form (I picture a car in my head, I see the car and feel myself as a separate entity observing the car. The car is the object, I am the subject). Trans-rational thinking is the unity of subject and object, thinking not of ourselves as separate entities, but thinking as the car, as all things. This is not mystical, mystics are transported beyond space-time experience into a completely different world. To quote directly, “The noetic experience stays within the mental realm of the mind. It is a higher experience of unity because it understands the unity, whereas the mystic does not understand it.” This supports the limitations language places on the mind. Thinking rationally means thinking in words, which limits our minds to fit the abstract into organized and structured sentences composed of a mere twenty-six letters. Instead, the noetic experience seeks to reach a state of conscious awareness of the world in an unprecedented way, not meant to be explained through language, which may explain why the concept is difficult to explain and accept. More to come .....

      There was once a large oak tree behind my house in an otherwise empty field. I was partial to this tree because, like me, it was one of a kind. It stood alone, like a defiant king or a lonely giant. Its branches scaled the air like a vine, reaching for the sun as a child for its mother. Leaves protruded from every branch end, perfectly masquerading the upper trunk, like someone had set an enormous bush atop a tall stump. Its great height (nearly seventy feet) coupled with its isolation from all other trees gave this oak a majestic appearance. On quiet days, I would retreat to my backyard to read, but was always distracted by the tree. I would stare in lost thought as ten minutes turned into twenty, twenty minutes into two hours, and two hours into an entire afternoon. My tree was comforting. Its drifting branches in the summer breeze lulled me into a hypnotic state of lucid calm.   Recently this tree was chopped down to build detached condos. Strangely, I felt sad not for my loss, but for the tree itself, and for the state of things. Truly, one of a kind matters little to some. There is a message here, one that has nothing to do with environmentalism. It is more personal. It is something different for me than it is for you. Resist the chainsaw, soak up the sun, stand up and be seen, keep reaching. You're in my heart. Yeah.

Deep inside must defy arrangement I've been stumblin from the startin blocks til now And I'll always try to justify the way I've been behavin Should I teach one not to know how?

           With the exponential growth of human population, finding one’s purpose becomes more and more elusive. Questions that once changed lives have now become rhetorical. For instance, what is my purpose in life? Where this was once a question to be answered, it has become one to be pondered, often for years, leaving us in a state of stagnation while our lives are dwindling by. While our hearts may be in the right place, our minds are lost amid a forest of likewise troubled minds searching for the path that leads to happiness. The trouble lies not in asking the question, in fact questions are the teaching tool of some of our wisest minds. The trouble lies in the attempt to answer that question. By answering the question "what is my purpose in life?", one is placing self imposed limitations on what he/she is capable of. Having purpose is powerful, that much is irrefutable, however endeavoring to identify that purpose can lead to a destructive state of mind. We have given purpose more power than it deserves. Enjoy who you already are, that is your purpose.

      The Slammer was known in less affluent parts of Detroit as a man of conviction. He made a significant fortune in the rare book trade. His bookstore, Twilight, gained critical affirmation by those in the know, those that could afford to drop twenty grand on a first print of Kafka's "Metamorphosis" published in Czech; the fifty-year-old white men from Birmingham who took an English class thirty years ago and considered themselves aficianados; the Gucci clad housewives from Bloomfield Hills who hadn't read a book since they were forced to in high school; the Royal Oak hippies who seemed to think owning a rare book made them deep. They trusted the Slammer, and he took full advantage. For this reason, he never saw Modo coming. Modo and his bag of tricks. A mistake the Slammer plans to remedy very soon, but Modo knows people, too.....

      How many times have you struggled to put what you are feeling into words? Emotions are meant to be felt, not heard. More satisfaction will come from simply experiencing an emotion than attempting to describe to someone how that emotion felt. We are all intuitive by nature. What you are feeling is often expressed more explicitly through other languages than speech.

       Nobody can tell you how to be happy. I think that fact has been established. Know then, that if you are unhappy, it is from your own doing. No outside force exists that is pinned against you, hoping for your failure, making you miserable. And if you are the cause of your own unhappiness, then you must be in control of your&nbsp;own&nbsp;happiness. There cannot exist unhappy without happy, otherwise there would be no balance. We would either be chronically happy or eternally miserable and not even know it. You must change your perspective. There cannot be happy without sad, so if you are sad, know that happy is just around the corner. But most importantly, you must come to this conclusion on your own. We all know these things, but we must  realize  them. We must understand the implications of being sad and being happy. Never accept what someone is telling you simply because it is in a book or a blog. Most blogs are full of shit. I am not so arrogant to insinuate that this blog is not full of shit as well. That is a conclusion you must draw yourself.

      Have you ever just been driving, daydreaming about how cool you are and disappointed that nobody else realizes how cool you are? This is called being stupid. Being the cause of your own disappointment is heartbreaking. Worse than that, you're relying on others to determine your worth. Daydreaming about how cool you are is alright, but stop there. Why place your peace of mind in the hands of another person just as confused as you?

      I found a website today that sells post-modern theorists action figures. My initial thought was, how can a thinker have an action figure? Aha! Even the post-modern can be post-modern. Paradoxical and ironic, these theorists are willing contributors to the conundrum of the theory which they study, making them victims, albeit aware victims, of the mass culture they so often pick apart. The theory itself is a giant paradox. What do I mean? I couldn't tell you. I really couldn't. I don't understand it myself. I grasp the concept like a rock-climber hanging one-handed from a small ledge on a mountain side, the ledge being my knowledge of the post-modern and the mountain being all it encompasses. I appreciate the work of Jameson and Adorno, but I'm afraid they are just as confused as I am.

      If you had one year left to live, would you spend it selfishly adventuring, doing all the things you never found the time do? Running with the Bulls, perhaps? Navigating the treacherous Amazon River? Hitchhiking across the States? Or would you cherish your last days with your family and friends? Go to the ballpark, maybe? Work on the car with your dad? Feed your infant nephew from a bottle? Cry over a sappy movie with your sister?  The fact is, today is always the last day of your life as you know it. Never again will you be as innocent as you are this very moment. Innocence is valuable. If you have any doubt, observe any child for just a few minutes. They have no concept of tomorrow. They do not plan ahead, they live. They live. This is the only conclusion.
