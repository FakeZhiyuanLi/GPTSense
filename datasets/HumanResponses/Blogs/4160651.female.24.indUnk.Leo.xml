      I heard you're in town from KC. I asked KC to help me check possibilities of working in HK. But I don't want you to know. Because I know you tend to take care of things for people. And I do not want that KC asked why Why didn't I let you take care of me I said.. I want to be on my own I do not want to be crippled because I know you are near I do not want to be suffocated by wanting you too much My own fear My own stupidity My own weaknesses But most of all.. I'm afraid to be near you Of what I may become

       My train of thots...      I have this gut feelings that I ain't going nowhere.    I just have this feelings that I would never go to Hong Kong.   God won't give me that chance.   Leaving everything up to God meaning not to think anymore about it, doesn't it?      I don't know much, but I know I want to leave Singapore.      Look deep inside my heart, dear Lord.    I don't know much, but I know I can't stand here anymore.      Kay? Well, that's the shortest 'relationship' I've ever had.    Done with it.    I want to start my own story, and not just simply be part of anybody's Hall of Fame.       Why is Hong Kong so important? These are what I think:   1. Hong Kong will mark my independence from anyone, anybody.   2. Hong Kong will open a new chapter of my life. I'll be closing my Singapore pages.   3. Hong Kong will bring me challenges that I need in order to grow up, and grow apart from everyone I love.    4. Hong Kong is like a dream comes true. God's given gift when I need it most. This is when He really gives me.   5. Hong Kong will be my 1st step outta my comfort zone. Hong Kong may mean failutres. But I will never know until I try it. I AM still YOUNG. These are the times to fail & get up again. These are the times of hardships, the times to plant everything.   6. My independence from Kay &amp; KC's words.       Sometimes I wish someone would understand what I am going through at the moment. But everybody is busy with their own lives, and Im not sure I can share this with Esti, Ina & Suze.    Gals @ home? Well.. only Vera. Dina doesn't care, &amp; I dunno what to expect from Ketut. Scared she'll say something discouraging.    Gals @ cell? Ipe knew but I supposed she's one of my level 2 friends.    Who're my level 1 friends? Boncu. My parents. Kay? I dunno. KC? I dunno. Vera? I think so. Mebbi..      Who lighted up my life? Who gave me hope to carry on?    God? Im not close enough to Him.    Mere humans? Not a single soul.       Not a single soul.       Kay said he didn't need anyone. He wanted to be all by himself. Why? I can't understand. That stubborn man.       I wanna be freed from pressure of settling down. I haven't done anything.    Have you ever felt anything like these? Like what I'm feeling rite now?   What do you want in life? and are you doing it?   Are you doing the things you want?

        On national day, Vera told me that she's getting married this November. I am very happy for her. But all the more I need to get outta this country, this place. I have so many things that I wanna do. I do not wanna feel exasperate to settle down. I haven't even achieve something yet.       So it all goes back to the very basic question: What do I want? Am I doing the things that I wanna do most?      I have been thinking of going to Hong Kong alot these days. I applied for Synovate Hong Kong. Gosh, just let me have the interview, and worry everything later?       Why do I wanna go to Hong Kong? Because i wanna get outta Singapore.    Because I am ready to take the plunge no matter how deep and how painful it's going to be.   And the egoist me doesn't really care whether I am making my parents worry about me or not.    Do I wanna be near Kay? Maybe. But most of all, I wanna prove to Kay that I can do things when I set my mind onto it. If someday Kay & I are together, that will be the r/s where both of us are equal, and not him leading me and talk me into things.       Why do I wanna get out of Singapore?   Because I am nobody here. I'll never be somebody here.    I wish with all my heart, after Hong Kong &amp; the tough life there, I can be something, no matter mow minute it is, here in Singapore.    Petrus left for Harvard, he got what he has always wanted.   Vera is going to settle down, she finally found her dream man, who wanted to spend the rest of his life with her as well. Lucky couple!   Michael is working with Bloomberg. He got what he deserved for.   Ellen is working with BCG and with all the challenges &amp; money. Good for her!      Sherly? She still has to find things that she really loves to do.    And she will.    Because she's not afraid, and she's still young.   But she worries she'll lost God and His presence.       On bended knees, I'm praying to you Lord..    Lead me to places.. make me grow in You.. and teach me the hardest things in life.   I am ready.

       This is what I feel right now. I feel so lonely here, dear God. Tuhan, I need something new, something exciting. I feel so mellow all the time. I feel so low, so lonely, so alone. God, you said forever you'll be faithful. God this is the time i really need you most.       What am I going to do with this life?    What do I want?   Why is growing up so hard?   Why do I have to be alone all the time?   Why can't I find someone who's willing to journey this life together?   Why can't I be alone?      God, your love endures forever, the song says. Father, hug me. Catch me.. I'm falling.    Forever you are faithful   Forever you are strong   Forever you are with us   Forever and ever      Father, I feel like crying. Most of the time, I hold back. But nowadays, from time to time, I feel like crying alot. Father I feel so disappointed with my life.    If to know myself meaning to know how lonely, incapable, dependent I am.. I wish to know not   I wish to be something in life, to be something to someone, but I am nothing.      KC said I have to find someone who's hardworking, so that we can journey this life together, build and strive together. Not good looking - nevermind, no money - nevermind, but hard working. Willing to struggle together. Maybe like KC and Iris.       Kay said he'd take care of me, solve my problems, but he can't be present with me. Kay himself had so much things on his mind. I just wanna sit and talk. Maybe I am at the junction of my life.       KC is leaving the co. soo.. by end of this month. Then I'll have no one to talk to anymore. Every morning, I'll just come and sit alone. Like I used to be.       Jesus shall take the highest honor   Jesus shall take the highest praise   Let all earth joined hand in exalting   The name which is above all other names   Let's bow the knee in humble adoration   For at his name every knee must bow   Let every tongue confess He is Christ God's only Son   Sovereign Lord we give you glory now
