      Today's topics have a common theme, I swear. I just haven't found it yet. First topic, the Olympics. These Olympic Games, as much as I hate to say it, haven't felt very authentic to me for some reason. On the surface, the games are the same as always. Same TV coverage, same events, same competition, etc. But somehow, the Olympics just don't feel real anymore. I remember watching the Atlanta games in the Poconos with the grandparents, and I felt a kind of... connection to the games. Like something truly meaningful was happening besides just the sports. This year, I don't feel it. To be honest, I don't even find myself cheering for the Americans. Call me a heartless Communist if you like, but my first thought upon seeing an American medalist in, say, track is "I wonder how long this guy/girl's been juicing." Way back when, the Olympics felt like an amateur competition. Now they feel professional, but that's not a good thing to me. The raw emotion of the athletes was energizing, it made me think about the experience of the athletes leading up to the games. It's all gone now. It feels manufactured, professionalized. Like the US basketball team. I cheer AGAINST them now. Tim Duncan aside, there's not a single player on that team who I genuinely feel any kind of sympathy for. And that's sad. And the gymnasts... while the scale is hard to tell from TV, they're absolutely tiny. They seem like a bunch of midgets. I thought I saw something in Carly Patterson when she won that gold. Maybe I'm a sucker for big smiles, but that girl's smile was just... electric. And then she ruined it all by opening her mouth in an interview and resembling Grover from Sesame Street in intelligence. But oh well...  Moving on to the Swift Boat Veterans topic. These Swift Boat Veterans groups really annoy me, simply because they are just so obviously politically-motivated. There was a Yahoo! News article today about a commander coming forth today who said that the Swift Boat Veterans (SBV) group's attack is a load of garbage. He also mentioned that he was the only officer still alive who was actually with Kerry the day the SBV group claims he "lied to get a bronze star". These groups are so obviously out for political gain, it's ridiculous. Kerry was a war hero. A privileged Yale student, he left school to go to Vietnam, then became an outspoken critic of the war afterwards. To me, that's honorable. Not to them, obviously. They'd prefer to lie and stand behind President Bush, who first hid behind his Daddy to get assigned to the joke that was the Air National Guard, then tripped out on coke instead of showing up for duty. And Kerry is the one under attack. Ridiculous...

      Well, I guess the topic of the day is going to be New Jersey soon-to-be-ex Governor James McGreevey. While I am, for the most part, a raging liberal, I am not a big McGreevey fan. Here's my problem with him. He called a news conference to announce that he was gay and that he intends to resign after the election in November, which would allow the New Jersey State Senate President to take over the governorship until McGreevey's term runs out in 2006. But that doesn't upset me. That's partisan politics right there. Any Republican would do exactly the same. What does upset me is that he's using his homosexuality as a shield to justify the corruption that would warrant a resignation from the office. McGreevey came out in a tear-jerker speech where he declared "I'm a gay-American, I'm an Irish-American... etc." He opened up about his extramarital affair with a man. While cheating on his wife is not a good thing, that can be forgiven too. Actually, it irks me in general when politicians jump on each other about their extramarital affairs. Every single one of them has likely had one, and the same politicians calling each other out for having them are probably guilty of having a few lovers themselves. But that doesn't bother me. Straight lover, gay lover, that's his business. But what  does  irk me is that McGreevey used his position as New Jersey governor to give his outrageously unqualified lover a job on the state payroll. And not just in the Highway Service or something, but in the state Homeland Security office. Something like that is completely inexcusable. It's the rough equivalent of Bill Clinton sending Monica to work as a nuclear engineer at Los Alamos.  While I fully support the gay rights movement, I'm beginning to think that the pendulum has swung too far in the wrong direction. A long time ago, two generations or so, homosexuality was a huge taboo. Rumors even exist that former spy Alger Hiss only admitted to treason because he was afraid that people would discover that he was homosexual. Now, however, homosexuality is celebrated to the extent that it's used as an excuse to cover up corruption. McGreevey's tear-jerking is a political ploy intended to cover up his corruption, which is the  actual  reason he shouldn't be in office.  My wish is that someday we'll accept homosexual relationships the same way we accept heterosexual relationships. If I'm a politician and I have an extramarital affair with some woman, and a rival politician discovers he is gay and has an extramarital affair with some guy, then neither of us should be scrutinized more or less. And he shouldn't be celebrated for coming out as a homosexual anymore than a black person should be celebrated for declaring that he is black. When we come right down to it, I think this country in particular is far too obsessed with attaching labels to people. When a white person looks at a black person, he thinks "black guy". I bet the converse is true. When a straight person looks at a gay person, he thinks "gay guy". Not necessarily in a negative way, but the label is still attached. That is, I think, the problem. We need to be able to look at people first and foremost as people, and avoid immediately categorizing them, because that is the root of fear and bigotry.

      Today's rant is about... religion. While I consider myself to be a Jewish person, I see it as more of a heritage than an actual set of beliefs. My beef with religion is that it is antithetical to reason. Let me explain. Religion asks a person to accept that God is his "Lord and Savior". No matter what God does, it is always "Good" and "Right". Those who follow God and his teachings are "Good". Those who don't are "Evil". The problem with this is that it removes the capacity of the individual to act as an individual moral agent, as a judge of right and wrong. Take the example of Isaac (I think it was Isaac, I'm probably wrong). God told him to go up on a mountain and show his love for God by sacrificing his son ritually. Now, let's evaluate this claim. If some person whom we consider absolutely good, say, Mother Teresa, were to tell someone that they need to sacrifice their son to be "good", we would say that Mother Teresa's gone off the deep end. We consider Mother Teresa "evil" for encouraging murder, and we consider the person who carried out the act "evil" for carrying out. However, when Isaac actually got up on the mountaintop and prepared to stab his son, God PRAISED him for his devotion to him and told him he didn't have to kill his son. My view is this: murder, no matter how it's carried out or by whom, is wrong. There's nothing more basic than the right of the individual to life, and no one has the power to dispense of this right besides the individual agent. Anyone or anything, even the presupposed "God" is only "good" to the extent that he carries out "good" actions,  because "good" is a quality attributable to an action rather than an invidiual. Someone who's a "good" person is good because he does "good" things, not because he's good in and of himself. By that same standard, God should only be considered "good" insofar as he always does the absolutely "good" thing. In this case he doesn't, so I throw away the conception of God as someone/something "absolutely good" on face. Now, here's why the conception of a "God" is bad for the world.  The idea of "God" encourages action for a greater end. The sole reason that a "God" of any kind is necessary is to encourage people to act morally. But let's take another step back. There are other reasons to act morally as well. For instance, not killing people because it is wrong in and of itself, not stealing or lying because they're bad. If you want a further reason, you shouldn't act in a way that you wouldn't want people to act towards you. So at best the "good" qualities of believing in a God are non-unique, and even at that they discourage rational thought by engaging in a sort of "appeal to authority" rather than allowing people to autonomously decide what is "good" and what is "evil".  Now, the conception of God is "bad" because it is used to motivate war and hatred for other cultures. Take, for instance, Islam. Islam has some honorable qualities. It encourages giving to charity, it encourages truthfulness, etc. On that same token, it has been twisted to serve as a motivation for murder, and a justification for suicidal murder. It glorifies "holy war" and serves as a barrier between these radical Muslims and reality. The solution to this, in my view, is to remove the amunition that the clerics use to condone murderous behavior. That is, eradicate the ideas preached by Islam. The good ones can be had either way, while the bad ones would be dissipated. Yes, the radical clerics would still be "bad" people, but they wouldn't have a Marx-esque "opiate of the masses" to direct the collective anger of a people toward those who don't belong to their culture.  But I'm by no means going to single out Islam as "evil". Let's look at Judaism as well. It, of course, has its own honorable aspects. However, it also encourages polarizing thought. The claim to Judaism is the belief that Jews are God's "chosen people". First of all, no absolutely good being has a "chosen" set of people, as this would be immoral. Moreover, it encourages a condescending mindset. The Jewish school of thought breeds a mentality wherein Jews see themselves as the "Chosen" people, and look down on others as "unenlightened", or "not chosen". Not only is this not a good thing on the part of the Jews, it also breeds hatred for them amongst other cultures, who are resentful of their claim to being "better" than others. It has contributed to genocide of the Jewish people because it allows people of other classes to band them together as a class and oppress them categorically. The answer to this, once again, is eradication of the mindset that breeds these things.  Third, I'll discuss Christianity. Christianity is very similar in its fallacies. The basis of Christianity is that a woman had a child whose father was not her husband. Reason tells us that she's cheated on him. Christianity tells us that it was "God". And her bastard son Jesus decides to go out and preach his gospel. He tells people that he's the "King of the Jews". But the Romans, who already oppress the Jews as is, see him as a dual threat. They kill him. That's not right. Yet somehow this makes Jesus a martyr. If he hadn't claimed to be the son of God, any Jew in Rome at the time could have declared himself "King of the Jews". He would have been seen as a fool for stirring the wrath of the Romans. Not Jesus. But I digress. Here's why modern Christianity is no good either. It has long encouraged an otherizing mindset of its own. Even in today's supposedly "open" United States, Christianity is still reified. You can pick up a magazine and read about someone who has "so much faith", as if that in and of itself is somehow a good thing. No Atheist has ever been elected to the Presidency for a reason. That reason is that this country sees itself as one that, while secular on face, is still built on the principles of Christianity, or specifically, Protestantism. One Catholic has ever been elected President. Zero Jews. A Muslim? Forget about it. The root of this bigotry is the Christian mindset of this country, that encourages political candidates to declare their faith. Not to mention that in the past, Christians have been responsible for the extermination of "heathens" in both North and South America. Yes, the Aztecs practiced ritual human sacrifice, but the Judeo-Christian God encouraged infanticide to Isaac. How is he any better?  Lastly, here's why organized religion as a whole discourages individuals from acting authentically. We'll start with the most basic examples. First is religion's view on sex. Sex is "evil". Everyone believes it. If, God forbid, you have premarital sex, you've "desecrated" yourself. And being adulterous is evil because it violated the "holy vows" of marriage. Now, here's my view. Why not? People should not be discouraged from any premarital sex simply because it's healthy for a relationship, even a premarital one. If someone even wants to run around and have sex with everyone in a row, to me, that's not "evil" either. Now, as rational agents, we may not want to engage in that because constant casual sex lacks intimacy, which we as humans crave. However, if someone does want to have casual sex, why shouldn't they? Yes, they'll catch diseases, but they know that consequence even before they have sex. The government going on a big anti-sex witch hunt is ridiculous. And it's all based on religion's premise that sex is bad. In many third-world countries, religion dictates that people practice female genital mutilation, which involves removing the woman's clitoris so that she will no longer have pleasure from sex. In my view,  this , not casual sex, is evil. Now, sex is not the only thing that religion has wrong. Organized religion encourages ridiculous and oppressive gender roles. Muslim women are not supposed to show their face. They are only to show themselves in front of their husbands. They are, in fact, the "property" of their husbands. Now, my question is, how do you justify this? To me, it's basically gender-based slavery. The wives are concubines and house slaves, serving roles only as sex objects and homemakers. If this isn't dehumanizing, I don't know what is. Plus, it discourages intimacy by forcing women to accept subservient gender roles. Now, my last argument is about homosexuality. Every major religion discourages homosexuality. It's "unnatural", they claim, "evil". The Bible tells Christians to "punish the sodomist" (or something along those lines). As rational individuals, we ask ourselves... why? My moral code tells me that if someone is sexually attracted to those of the same gender as them, fine. Why is that my business? There's nothing "wrong" with them. They're simply different from me, in the same way that someone who has dark skin or narrow eyes is different from me. Are they worse? No. Is their behavior in any way objectionable? No, to an even greater degree. Yet, the Bible tells us that anal sex is evil. That homosexuals are "perversions", that they must be punished. And my response is this: screw the Bible. Make your own rational decisions without the Bigotry that it encourages. And if it encourages you to do something moral... well, you have a head on your shoulders, too. Ever since I turned 6 years old, I've known the difference between right and wrong, so I assume most people do too. So follow your conscience, not some false idol that lives in the sky and in the pages of your Bible.  I don't mean to offend any religious people, but I'm not going to renege on anything I wrote here.

      I decided this would be fun. My opinions on:  Abortion: Yes. If I'm not having babies, who the hell am I to tell a woman that she has to have one?  Affirmative Action: Yes. People argue against it, and I bought it until I read a UChicago/MIT Study that basically proved that people with "black-sounding" names like Jamal, LaToya and Chamique are 50% less likely to be hired, even with similar credentials, than are people with "white-sounding" names like Tyler, Burt, and Natalie.  Age of Consent: Tricky. I guess 2 year difference makes sense, but put the age of consent at 15 unless the other partner is over 30.  Animal Testing: It depends. Shampoo, no. Things that cause cancer and such, to a limited extent, yes.  Death Penalty: Hell no. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.  Downloading Music/Movies: Hell yeah.  Decriminalization of Drugs: Marijuana, sure. I read somewhere that the reason pot was criminalized in the first place was because it was mistakenly linked to some guy's murderous rampage around the end of the 19th century. Hard drugs, no. On second thought, decriminalizing marijuana detracts from killer movies like "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle", so I'll have to call it a maybe.  Factory Farming: No. This country consumes WAY too much as is. Organic stuff tastes better, and while animals don't really have rights in my mind, torturing them is also not cool.  Free Trade: No. It leads to exploitation of third-world countries with different laws, encourages outsourcing of labor, leads to the dependence of third-world economies upon corporations. In short, not good.  Funding of Arts: Most definitely.  Gay Marriage: I don't know why this discussion happens in the first place... Denying gays the right to marry is like telling black people they can't marry white people. It's ridiculous, bigoted, and discriminatory. If that IDIOT Bush wants to protect the "sanctity of marriage", he needs to make use of that rock he has instead of a brain and realize that something with "sanctity" is connected to religion, and therefore SHOULDN'T be regulated by government in the first place. The whole argument is moronic... yes, a no-brainer.  Gun Control: Yes. Background checks are good, and I think all assault and automatic weapons should be banned. Who needs an assault weapon to hunt deer?  Immigration: In the age of terrorism, we need tough border restrictions, though recognizing the rights of illegal immigrants after background checks (to ensure that they're not terrorists) is also necessary.  Hardcore Pornography: Why the hell not? Deconstructing taboos is the first step toward true open-mindedness.  Human Cloning: Tricky, but yes, provided it's voluntary. Stem cell research also kicks ass.  Military Draft: Of course not. If people don't love the country enough to protect it, why should the government force them into service?  Minimum Wage: Yes, though it should vary depending on age (teenagers from high-class families get less compared to lower-class adults) and socioeconomic status (poor teenagers get more than rich teenagers).  Prostitution: Yes, with restrictions. Controlling STDs in prostitutes would be a good idea.  School Vouchers: No. It dodges the problem with our public schools, and the amount that kids from the failing schools get is laughably low, not nearly enough to pay for a half-decent private school. The voucher system, if instituted, would be just wasted money.  Taxes: Higher. Idiot Bush thinks advocating tax cuts to the richest is going to fix the economy? He needs to think again. EJ Dionne, Jr's Washington Post editorial this morning provided some fun statistics about the Bush tax cuts: The Office of Management and Budget (a federal office) reported that 1/3 of Bush's tax cuts went to people averaging $1.2 million in household earnings annually. Households with incomes in the top 1% received an average of  $78,460 , whereas those in the middle 20% averaged a cut of $1,090. For all of you keeping score, that's a 72-1 ratio for the rich.  RIDICULOUS.  United Nations: It's laughable as is, but needs to be revamped. Maybe it'll prevent dumb US presidents from taking unilateral action...  Universal Health Care: Of course. At least until drug prices go down. A family without healthcare would literally bankrupt itself without some type of coverage.  War on Terrorism: Necessary, but should be defensive, not pre-emptive. The active component of the War on Terrorism should be deconstructing the mindsets and actions that lead to terrorism: fundamentalist Islam, imperialist action by the US (yes, we should take some of the blame), and lack of education.  Welfare: Yes. Unlimited for those who are handicapped in some way, capped for those who are too lazy to get work.

      Well, here I am trying to decide whether the individual claims of privacy ought to take precedence over competing claims of societal welfare. Just offhand, I get the impression that this topic will be all about feminism. Catherine MacKinnon has argued that recognizing a public-private dichotomy serves to oppress women by sheilding domestic abuse and other crime against women within the "private realm". I don't think that I agree with this, and here's why. First, MacKinnon makes a broad generalization about the public-private rift. She claims that categorizing things such as domestic abuse as "private" prevents them from being recognized as problems, or being reported to police. While this may be a problem, I think that "privacy" is not the root of the problem. The impression I get personally is that the cause of the failure to report domestic incidents is the subjugation of women into traditional gender roles within the households in which domestic abuse is a problem. The women in these homes don't report the incidents because they take their marriage vows literally, believing that they should continue to serve their husbands, despite the obvious abuse that they are taking. The failure to report these incidents indicates a problem in the subservient mindsets of these women, not in the public-private division itself. In short, failure to report incidents is a symptom, not the problem. The root of the problem, in my view, is the fallacious mindset of these women. When they come to respect themselves, seeing themselves as equals with their husbands, then they can freely exercise the ability to report domestic incidents. In fact, I think deconstruction of the public-private dichotomy would result only in increased trauma to these insecure women who rely emotionally upon husbands, even abusive ones, and who would not be able to handle their "private" lives coming into the "public" sphere. Therefore, the necessary first step is to deconstruct the subservient mindsets, which will itself fix the problems that MacKinnon describes.

      It's been 3 weeks since I got my paycheck for the spring, and I've officially got $6 left off the $230 that I made in the spring. How do I spend $230 in 3 weeks? Let me go down the list. First, I owed Colin $20 for when we went to CalTor sometime; then I decided to pre-order Halo 2 a solid 3 months in advance. That's already $80 out. Yesterday was Ilya Ganelin's birthday, so it was $10 on "The Killers" CD for him, $19 on a Juvenile CD for me, then $1 for a Sprite.               The rest I probably threw away when Ilya and I went to the Projekt Revolution concert at Nissan Pavilion last weekend. That was actually a pretty significant waste of money. We were in section 101 (right behind the pit), but the concert never really got going. The people in the pit really sucked... a bunch of fat rednecks with mullets and "Miller Lite" hats. None of them knew how to mosh, and no one really crowdsurfed either. Four bands were at the show: Less than Jake, the Used, Korn, and Linkin Park... and every single one of them sucked. The highlight of the show was when Snoop Dogg had a set. It consisted of him going through about 2 songs off his early albums, then him deciding to smoke pot onstage... along with everyone else who was in his "crew". From that point on, the lyrics got less and less coherent, but Snoop got better and better. You have to be there to feel it, but seeing Snoop Dogg get high is... legendary. It's like seeing Michael Jordan shoot jump shots, seeing Ray Lewis do his sacrificial goat dance before a Ravens game, or seeing Jenna Jameson have sex. It's just something that makes you want to wave your middle finger in the air and forget about everything. On the downside, when Jonathan Davis from Korn tells you to do that, it just leads to you getting angry... at him. After he put together a piece-of-shit set, then told the audience to wave their middle fingers in the air and yell "Fuck this!", Ilya and I decided to yell "Fuck you!" at him, and we got a better response from the people around us than he did. But when Linkin Park started to play, we let them do like 5 songs, then we left. After that, I had my day ruined. We were walking to the bathroom to wash our hands, and there was some 55-year-old dude with a handlebar mustache standing right outside the door getting a blowjob from a girl (she couldn't have been over 25) resembling Jaba the Hutt from the Star Wars movies. Then, when we walked out of the bathroom, the guy was kissing her. I threw up on the sidewalk.  Late last night, they released the debate resolution for the spring. To be honest, I don't like it very much. It's "Individual claims of privacy ought to take precedence over competing claims of societal welfare". I think it encourages stupid case positions on the negative, and encourages the affirmative to take untrue positions without warrants, like the Catherine McKinnon position. All in all, I don't think it's going to make for enjoyable debate. But it's actually now 1 PM, and I have to do 50 pages of summer reading to finish all the books by the time school starts. I'm out.
