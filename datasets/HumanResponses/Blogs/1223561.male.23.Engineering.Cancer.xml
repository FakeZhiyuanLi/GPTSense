       Imagine.......   If you got into a taxi and he started driving backwards, would the taxi driver end up owing you money?  If it's zero degrees outside today, and it is supposed to be twice as cold tomorrow, would the degrees still be zero?  Why is it called building when it is already built?  If pro is the oppsite of con, is progress the opposite of congress?  If you drop a chameleon in water, will it turn clear?  If tin whistles are made of tin, what do they make fog horns out of?  Is it possible to be totally partial?  If a book about failures doesn't sell, is it a success?  Isn't it a bit unnerving that doctors call what they do "practice"?  If all the world is a stage where is the audience sitting?  If work is so terrific, how come they have to pay you to do it?  If you're not supposed to drink and drive, then why do bars have parking lots?  If you take an Oriental person and spin him around several times, does he become disoriented?  If people from Poland are called Poles, why aren't people from Holland called Holes?  Do infants enjoy infancy as much as adults enjoy adultery?  Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker?  When cheese gets its picture taken what does it say?  If horrific means to make horrible, does terrific mean to make terrible?  Why isn't 11 pronounced onety one?  If lawyers are debarred and clergymen defrocked, doesn't it follow that electricians can be delighted, musicians denoted, cowboys deranged, models deposed, dry cleaners depressed?  Why is it if someone tells you there are 1 billion stars in the universe, you will believe them but if they tell you a wall has wet paint you will have to touch it to be sure?  If Fed Ex and UPS were to merge, would they call it Fed UP?  Do Lipton Tea employees take coffee breaks?  I thought how people seem to read the Bible a whole lot more as they get older, then it dawned on me ...they are cramming for their final exams.

       Calvin and Hobbes Quotes  Happiness isn't good enough for me! I demand euphoria! ------------------------------------------------------------------- The purpose of writing is to inflate weak ideas, obscure pure reasoning, and inhibit clarity. With a little practice, writing can be an intimidating and impenetrable fog! ------------------------------------------------------------------- Calvin: I'm a genius, but I'm a misunderstood genius. Hobbes: What's misunderstood about you? Calvin: Nobody thinks I'm a genius. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, it just seemed wrong to cheat on an ethics test. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Calvin: Can you make a living playing silly games? His Dad: Actually, you can be among the most overpaid people on the planet. ------------------------------------------------------------------- If you do the job badly enough, sometimes you don't get asked to do it again. ------------------------------------------------------------------- The only skills I have the patience to learn are those that have no real application in life. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Some people are pragmatists, taking things as they come and making the best of the choices available. Some people are idealists, standing for principle and refusing to compromise. And some people just act on any whim that enters their heads. I pragmatically turn my whims into principles! ------------------------------------------------------------------- Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us. ------------------------------------------------------------------- It seems like once people grow up, they have no idea what's cool. ------------------------------------------------------------------- The real fun of living wisely is that you get to be smug about it. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Calvin: Know what I pray for? Hobbes: What? Calvin: The strength to change what I can, the inability to accept what I can't, and the incapacity to tell the difference. -------------------------------------------------------------------  I say, if your knees aren't green by the end of the day, you ought to seriously re-examine your life. ------------------------------------------------------------------- But Calvin is no kind and loving god! He's one of the old gods! He demands sacrifice! ------------------------------------------------------------------- It's psychosomatic. You need a lobotomy. I'll get a saw. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Why waste time learning, when ignorance is instantaneous? ------------------------------------------------------------------- Hobbes: What would you call the creation of the universe? Calvin: The Horrendous Space Kablooie! ------------------------------------------------------------------- If something is so complicated that you can't explain it in 10 seconds, then it's probably not worth knowing anyway. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Who wouldn't be interested in everything we do?! ------------------------------------------------------------------- I think we dream so we don't have to be apart so long. If we're in each other's dreams, we can play together all night. ------------------------------------------------------------------- As a math atheist, I should be excused from this. ------------------------------------------------------------------- This one's tricky. You have to use imaginary numbers, like eleventeen ------------------------------------------------------------------- You can present the material, but you can't make me care. ------------------------------------------------------------------- YAAH! DEATH TO OATMEAL! ------------------------------------------------------------------- >From now on, I'll connect the dots my own way. ------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm learning real skills that I can apply throughout the rest of my life .... Procrastinating and rationalizing. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Reality continues to ruin my life. -------------------------------------------------------------------  Calvin: Sometimes when I'm talking, my words can't keep up with my thoughts. I wonder why we think faster than we speak. Hobbes: Probably so we can think twice. ------------------------------------------------------------------- I liked things better when I didn't understand them. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Is it a right to remain ignorant? ------------------------------------------------------------------- I think nighttime is dark so you can imagine your fears with less distraction. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Miss Wormwood: What state do you live in? Calvin: Denial. Miss Wormwood: I don't suppose I can argue with that... ------------------------------------------------------------------- What's the point of wearing your favourite rocketship underpants if nobody ever asks to see 'em? ------------------------------------------------------------------- My life needs a rewind/erase button.

      For all the times that Mr. Prasad knew of himself, he had never been happy. For happiness didn't find it's way to his home, ever since he knew of himself. Happiness is a state of mind, always said Mrs. Prasad, whose source of unhappiness was her husband's unhappiness and whose spirit was her husband's only infinite resource. My mind doesn't even have country, let alone a state, always poor-joked Mr. Prasad.  Chandrashekar Venkat Prasad (First, Middle and last names) was born to a not-so-rich, not-so-poor class of family, at a time when middle class was almost synonymous with the not-so-poor, and the upper middle classes were anonymous. His father had been an heir to one-sixth of his grandfather's ancestral property. Prasad's grandfather had amassed much wealth, and his father added a lot more to that. Lot more than all the amassed wealth could handle. Casino gamblings, business ramblings, fighting siblings and so on and so forth had negated all the advantages of what could have been a profitable heirdom. By the fourth year, Prasad (arguably the earliest memories the Prasad had) had witnessed most of all what the great epics of our land (The Ramayana, the Mahabharata, to name a few) talk, speak of and teach us. Though his infantile and juvenile mind couldn't grasp the gist of those epics, the reality of his life slowly hardened him, hardened him against hope, joy and happiness. The harsh realities of his life spawned their own myths, legends, histories, songs, epics, lessons and morals. Life became a responsibility (if you wanted to shun it)or a response to a responsibility (if you responded to it). Dreams were there only to be dreamt, life was there only to exist, and the rest was there, only because there was nothing that could be done - either for it-to-be-there or it-not-to-be-there.

      Hours..days...weeks...months...and ofcourse Years..are fast running. There's no time even to think that they are passing off so fast. is there really no time or dont I want to take out time? I am really not sure. This "dreadful" mechanical life is killing me from inside. Its not that I am doing an extra effort than everyone else...but is this what I really wanted in life? I keep asking this question to myself innumerable times everyday...still have got no answer..or is it I dont want to listen to the answer cos I am scared of it? All my hidden secrets, desires, fantasies....I am sacred they will all die down soon and I will remain "life less".

      Daytona!  Just back from the DAYTONA Beach trip. It was kewl. Had fun. Beaches..Babes..Bikes..It was beautiful! Looks like the B words are in huge demand these days! It was the "BIKE week" last week at Daytona. Bikers from all over the country assembled there. The whole city was Buzzing with Bikes!  Along with the good things, there are certain "unpleasant things" associated. Asusual, people boozed,Ravi and I were the only silent spectators there. Things got heated up to such an extent that some of them were almost ready for blows! Ravi and I were damn pissed at what happened. Why must one ever trigger sensitive issues into discussion and that too when nobody wants to listen to the other but simply put his point forward? Other than this, EGO, the "EVIL" ONE, clearly in the group.  I dont deny we had a good time. We played, laughed, had a sexy time in the beach. But there was something lacking. May be I am wrong. May be it is just me who feels like that...if it so, I pray I be Wrong.  Today is Holi. Called up home. It would have been real fun to be at home at this time..but anyways, I am still enjoying here.  I was really happy to know that Veedee got a call from SPJain. I sincerely hope he makes it into it. For all that he has done and sacrificed, he deserves that.  Thats it for today! Bye Blog!

      Hey guys!  Watched Lakshya yesterday. Well made film with no flaws difficult to find! I guess the word Lakshya says it all- "Lakshya- That IS the word" as Preity Zinta repeats in the movie. It's kinda hard to digest that Farhan Akhtar has directed Lakshya after the witty, whacky Dil Chahta Hai. But he deserves all applause for his effort. So does Hrithik Roshan. He was a perfect match for "Karan Shergill". His performance was damn good.  The songs though would keep you wanting for more and infact better. The music is definitely not on par with Dil Chahta Hai. On the whole a film worth watching. Well after watching the film, I asked myself "What is my Lakshya?" Hope I find an answer to it very soon.  Cheers, Sos

      Hi guys!!!  The CFC Chapter is back to share its Long weekend trip to the best beaches in USA. And mind you, the beaches were the "best" in everyway! Also, this was the first trip that we by ourselves drove to all these places, now that we all have our licenses!  It all started on Friday evening, when Ravi, Raja and I went to the Enterprise rental office to rent a car- A MITSUBISHI Gallant 2004 ! The car was damn sexy. I was fortunate enough to be the first one to drive the car, the whole of friday evening. Before I begin, it would be great if you could have a look at this link. These are the places where we had been!   http://www.floridasbeach.com/bch_nat/topbeaches.aspx  On Saturday morning, we hit the Interstate- 4 towards Tampa Bay. We went to Fort De Soto Beach first. Fort de Soto Beach has been officially ranked as the Number 1 beach in continental USA ! So was it...truly number 1 ! Once we reached the beach, we all got into our shorts and were damn excited to take a plunge in the warm, inviting waters of the Gulf of Mexico, more so the Atlantic Ocean. The water was clam, with not many waves, and truly pleasing to have a dip. The best part of the beach was the Canoeing and Kayaking section in the back waters. We were 7 of us, formed 3 teams of 2 each. And then began our Kayaking adventure. It was my first time and I enjoyed each and evry bit of it, though it was very tiring! We were there in our kayaks for an hour..having fun in the backwaters, ocassionally hitting the bushes on the sides! While kayaking, we happened to meet some of our batchmeates at BITS. I m sure everyone would know them here! We came across Shruthi Dash, Vinay Sharma, Shobana Desikan, Siveramakrishnan(K 2) and Deepika! We exchanged "Hellos" and the we were back on our own ways. Well it was nice to see them there...of all places in the middle of an ocean! They were on a trip to Florida from Ohio. So guys, all those not planning to visit Florida when you are in US, remember that you are missing out something really beautiful!  Back to kayaking...after that, we went to chill out on Fort De Soto Beach. The beach was lovely, with white sands ( almost as white as a paper) and as soft as flour! At about 5 we started off to Clearwater. That was about an hour drive from Fort De Soto. As the name says "Clearwater", the waters are literally "clear". You can clearly see the sea bed. All of us jumped into the waters again! Saw in the sunset while in the water and it was simply superb! We then drobe back to our motel at about 10 in the night, took bath, this time with fresh water!, ordered Chinese food and slept by 1:00. We had no enthu to drive back to the shore to see the night life there. We were tired.  Sunday morning, we had breakfast at McDonald's near the motel and started off straight to Caladesi Island (ranked 5th best beach in USA). To reach this place, we had to drive to Honeymoon Island and take a ferry from there! There is no road to Caladesi. By the time we reached Caldesi it was 12 noon. We were allowed to stay there for 4 hours, that is till 4:00. And the island was beautiful. There's nothign in this place except for the beach. Truly, the beach was amazing. The waters were shining in the bright sun light. Once again, we all jumped into the ocean, played in the waters till we got totally exhausted. We rented Umberellas and chairs, for shade. And it was a great feeling to just relax on the beaches, with the goggles on your face and you resting on the chairs under the umberellas, with the Ocean in front of you! Before we realised it was 4:00 andwe were su[pposd to head back to Honeymoon Island. At about 4:30 we started off to Orlando-the City Beautiful! The weather was very rough, it was raining heavily with thunderstorms and lightning. But we managed to drive well and reach the Downtown (the place where the government buildings are located in a city). It was 4th of July- the American Independence Day. We stopped at Lake Eola. There were tens of thousands of people gathered around the lake for the fire works display. The lake was very scenic. With the Downtown buildings on one side, trees on the other, a lovely weather, and a marvellous "Rainbow" in the sky! The entire picture is indescribable! After a 2 hour long wait, we got to see the fire works display and it was definitely worth waiting for that! By the time we reached home it was 12 in the night, and we were totyally exhausted! I just went and hit the bed. Monday - the day started very late..at 12!!! Got ready and went to Orlando Fashion Square Mall. We did some shopping as it was Raja's bday on 6th. Got his nice boots. Later in the night we had the cake cutting and champagne opening! And with that our long weekend came to an end! And I m here jotting down all those memories which are still very clear and which want me to go back to those amazing places.  That's it guys.  I will upload the snaps very soon.  Luv Sos/Srinivas/Srinu

      The Legend of Bhagat Singh ---------------------------------------------- Watched: 26th April 2003, DVD at home.  "History is like the Dark house on the other side of the river. You might not be able to travel across the river to see what's inside it. All you can do is wait for someone to come from the house and tell you what the house is like".                                             ----- Self, inspired from the God of Small Things, by Arundhati Roy  I somehow couldn't help remembering GOST by Arundhati Roy, and Ammu's brother Chacko who had his ideas about history, when I watched the movie The Legend of Bhagat Singh. A RajKumar Santoshi film, an Ajay Devgan Starrer, and an A.R.Rahman's film for starters. (Just in case you are confused which Bhagat Singh movie I'm talking about, 't was one of the five released then).  It was a good movie. And I usually say that to all movies that I put three hours of time to watch. But I'm also saying this because I am forced to think, at the end of the movie, about myself, our nation and history on the whole. Have we betrayed ourselves, our nation, and our history? The movie concludes with a similar remark.  The fortunate or unfortunate thing about history is that, it's closed from us. Like the house on the other side of the river. We never know what murmurs and rumors and murders are going on in there. What survives, comes out to tell a story. And we are more or less crippled to judge the truth in it.  I do not know if someone from Bhagat Singh's time survived to tell us his story. But there are facts. There are happenings. And every story teller and historian will connect the facts using his logic, reason and imagination. It's his job, he cannot escape it. And it's upto us to buy it.  Was Gandhiji as weak as is portrayed in the movie? Did he feel insecure by Bhagat's militant patriotism? If we had opted the violent way to end the slavery, would we have achieved our freedom long long back? Would lesser people have lost lives that way? Would we have been a different country then, so that we wouldn't have to depend on making sure of our alien accent and false funds to look for greener pastures? The dam was broken.  At one point in the movie, Gandhiji takes back his non-co-operation movement because of the incident in Chouri Choura. And says later I think, that the nation isn't ready for freedom yet. I couldn't help wondering if we are free yet. Bhagat is angered at this, and decides to go on his own way to fight for freedom. The line between defense and  violence is a very thin one. And more often than not, they are used interchangeably. A Lion that attacks you, has to be killed. No body has tamed a lion, without ever killing one before. That was Bhagat Singh's logic. May be Gandhiji worked with the logic that we are dealing with humans all the time and not lions. Can history tell us who was right? I donot know.  We depend on foreign channels, crave for foreign currency, gladly give up the citizenship, yet complain about the system, the corruption, and the insincerity of our people. And yet proclaim, "I hate hypocrites".     One point that I liked in the movie was that it asks you to think on your own. It asks you not to be passive. It asks you to go ahead with your ideals. It tells you that you can live by not eating for 50 days (I felt ashamed of myself when I ate a Pizza today afternoon). It tells you to live for ideals. It tells you to die for your ideals. It teaches you to endure everything for your ideals. Do we need to be a Bhagat Singh to do that? Need not be. But if all our freedom fighters, whether it was the militant one or the non-violent one, could endure so much for their country and countrymen, can't all of us rise against the petty cravings, to see our country grow and grow with it? That my friend is the real difference between America and India. Americans have stayed in the country for all the years after their independence to build a country they call their own. Let movies based on history be an inspiration for all of us to do just that.

      Finding Nemo-Watched on 6th June 2003, Regal Cinemas  Welcome to Walt Disney's World. A world where the soul and the spirit exist not just in human bodies, but in any creature that you can imagine. Where toys and fish have lot more to teach us, about the business of living, love and friendship. Where you'd find a lot more adults than kids, watching, enjoying and may be even learning from the movie. Welcome to Walt Disney's World.  "Finding Nemo" takes you through a journey, in the deep currents of the Ocean, to the deep insecurities of an over protective father, the coming of age of an adventurous son, the undying spirit of "escape-to-freedom", along with a sharky message "Fish are Friends, not food".   This animation movie by Pixar Animation studios was an absolute treat to watch. The depths and the colors of the ocean, the colors of the corals and reefs take you to a world you can only dream of under an ocean. And it's a movie that's funny. Not just the kids way of funny, cos, there were lot more giggles from adolescents and adults (or do they laugh louder) and by the time you came out of the hall, you would keep hearing "Wasn't that an awesome movie" for quite a long time.  So what's the awe about? It's a relatively simple story, about a clown fish father(who is not funny), Marlon, whose only son Nemo has a small fin. Marlon is over concerned about the safety of his son ("The ocean is not a safe place"), and is reluctant to send him even to the school (An ocean school). But on his first day to school, Nemo eager to prove to his dad that he can, take care of himself, goes that extra league, and is captured by a diver, and ends up in a dentist's aquarium. And if he doesn't find his route to freedom, he might as well end up being a dead fish in the hands of the dentist's niece with ugly teeth (I forgot her name).  Mean while, the horrified father takes on the fearsome ocean carrying the hope of rescuing his son, from... well, he doesn't know what or where. But with the aid (and delay) from a forgetful friend he makes (or was it fate!!!), Dorry, who tells him about the boat and the address of the dentist (Dorry can read the English Language, but she occasionally forgets she can), he embarks on a journey to be Finding Nemo.  While swimming on his way, he befriends sharks who want to change the shark's image among the fish (Fish are Friends, not food), but a twist of fate, compels him to escape them. But danger follows him and Dorry, when they get caught up jelly fish. The sea turtles help them out and help them to find their way to Sydney, where Nemo is.  In a parallel turn, Nemo knows that his "cowardly" father is fighting a whole ocean to find him, and with his accomplices, bravely turns the aquarium to a stinking pond, so that he can escape when the aquarium is being cleaned. The idea fails, and he feigns "dead" to escape through the toilet. Marlon ends up in the dentist's room at that point with the help from a pelican, but mistakes his son to be dead.  Whether Nemo and his friends in the aquarium finally escape and whether he can reunite with is father forms the climax of the movie.  The movie was like in fact like the ocean. I look back at it, and it feels great to have watched it. Like the waves in the ocean, we laughed at Dorry, and the pelicans, we prayed for Nemo and cried with Marlon. But I have always wondered at the technology that could breathe so much of life into these creatures that didn't exist. May be God feels the same way looking at us.

      Dear guys, I got all your wishes... I donot want to say thank you for your wishes, cos I guess I have a right on them...:) I'm 22 from today... As always it doesn't feel anything different from yesterday.. but there's a whole year of difference in what I should tell my age is to people...:) And then ...baam...I realised that celebrating birthdays, was just ... it's a one day thing that changes your age... but then growth is continuous... happens everyday every moment... Ok, we realise that only at few moments in life... and probably birthdays are the times when we realise it the most... atleast for me, I guess... So what did I do for my b'day...? I had asked people not to go overboard to spend the b'day... I mean... it's not that I didn't want a celebration or anything like that... but it's just that ... in the whole process of doing something different and spmething special, I thought that may be we tend to lose that "doing-it-for-you" thing somewhere and end up with "i-did-that-for-your-birthday" thing... not tht anybody would end up that way, but I wanted it to be a very simple one... no hassles for anyone, just a time to be together with people who have known you... I do not know if people understood or misunderstood what I meant, but may be someone must have been hurt that I asked then not to go overboard... so i refrained from making any strong statements further... On the evening of July 16th US time, I came back home at 5 'o clock... slept for a little while, like I always do... Woke up at I think some time around 9, cooked aloo fry (it didn't turn out too good)... I spoke little qith anybody... and fakir and vinay (my roommates) were coming into and going out of the house ... I don't usualy spend anytime at the comp ion the house unles for wirk... and though I thought I would go to college in the night nand come back at 12'o clock, I thought I must enjoy my b'day... I didn't go to college, instead called my sister... she was asleep, but I just had enough time to get wished up by her... it was already my b'day in India... Followed it up with a call to mom and dad... the first... nope second time I was away from them for my b'day...:) Well... I followed it up with an hour and a half completely spending the time in front of the comp, listening to all the songs that I hadn't listened to for quite sometime... and ... I just continued to listen... I sang out loud (the door closed, ofcourse), danced a little, conscious that I was approaching of my b'day, but oblivious of my roommates coming in and out of my room, "i-dunno-thinking-what-about-me"... At about 11:57, when "shakalaka baby" was playing, fakir barged into my room, and said "Chilaka, come"... I laughed out loud, and moved into our living room... and there it was, a beautiful chocolate cake, with two candles each shaped a 2 lighted... and there they were, fakir, anusha, vinay, pande, anitha, aparna and om....the lights went out, the candles were lit, and I blew the candles amidst the "happy b'day to youuu..." Gave everybody a share of the cake amidst the flashes of fotos.... got a phone call from amar wishing me b'day, got wishes from shankar, raj, hari and kalyan, who dropped in to say "Happy B'day"...Got phone call from Anant and Mrs.Anant wishing me for my b'day, and a phone call from roopa wishing me b'day... and then we sat, I thanked everybpdy for doing it all, and decided that we will go to Woodlands, n Indian restaurant the next day... Everybody left then, I went back to the comp, receiving messages from slash, veedee, chatting with balu and ajay, listening to songs all the while... I took leave of everybody, at about 4'o clock in the morning and slept... The next day I got up at around 11:30 am... I got up and started to get ready... I was happy that it was like any other day... I brushed, took a head bath (as mom said), and was going to wear my clothes, when Fakir said "Wear these"... And he tossed three T-shirts, and a Jeans... I remembered that I had told my mom that I'll buy new clothes for myself... And I didm't know what to say to Fakir... the only thing that could come out of my mouth was "Thanks..." Anusha was there too.. and I knew they had it all planned it out since yesterday... I had to rush to college... and I boarded the bus at 1:30 pm., but while that I had forgoten my cell and camera... I had a teleconference at 2:30 in the lab, and I didn't want to be late... I went into the lab., and got to my desk, when Dr.Jack noticed me and said, "Hey Ravi's Here, Happy B'day"... The rest of the gang too didn't waste time in wishing me my b'day, but then we got down to business, and the rest of the aternoon was uneventful... I just made sure that everybody who needs to know the directions to woodlands knew it... I called up Shankar, told Dr.Balaji ( a new member in the Datawarehouse team, replacing Dr.Amr), called Lisa -the ex CATSS worker- she wasn't feeling well though, told smitha, fakir, vinay, anusha, aparna and her roommates, that we will start at around 7 'o clock... Mean while I was also receiving mails wishin me b'day from Malaiappan (my PS mate), slash, mala, and others... At 6'o clock, we watched our favourite tv comedy series "That 70's show", and started for home... Fakir called Anurag if we can start a bit late, cos by the time Anant Bhaiyya would be back, it might get delayd a bit... Anurag spoke to him, and we started home... I went back home, laid on the couch as is my habit everyday... Fakir and Vinay came in and went out, and it was past 7, past 7:30 but no one said "lets start" yet... I knew something was going on, but I used the time to not be disturbed from my nap... Anurag called a couple of times asking me to ask fakir to call him whenever we are ready to go... I noticed fakir in house at 8:00 pm, and told him about our departure... He said he spoke to anurag, and said he's going to bhaiyya's place, and will call me when we are ready... I knew... and he knew I knew... and he knew I knew that he knew... and so on.. I got a call in two minutes, and when I went over to bhaiyya's place, opened the door, there it was, a cake with lotsa candles, with "Happy B'day chilaka" on it, with everybody who was suposed to out that night, gathered... the room was filled with balloons, and colored paper (forgot what it's called)... and everybody crying out Happy B'day to you... I didn't have any wordsto say, I was overwhelmed, I didn't even notice the name on the cake (I thought it was chandra, not chilaka- I knew it only after wards)... I cut the cake again, gave the pieces to all those who missed it the day before, the first piece to Mrs.Anant, bhabhi for us... and then she also prepared ragda paati, chai for all of us... the only thing I could say all the while was "Thank yu" al the time... I was feeling very oiverwhelmed, because Ididn't know if I had deserved al that.. But I had decided not to judge... I decided to accept it the way it was, without questioning anything... It was about 8:45 when we started to think about "what next..." Woodlands..? they would close by 10:00 pm we thought, we called them up , but they said they would take orders till 15 minutes before closing that's till 9:15... So we decided we 'd make a dash for it at Woodlands... Since Bhaiyya wasn't there, Bhabhi wouldn't come, so wouldn't anusha and vinay and so wouldn't fakir,... So we decided to go another day when bhaiyya and sai (my roommate who was transferring to Houston) also would be there... we started out and reached woodlans at about 9:20, only to know that they can't serve anything but dosa at that time... After a little deliberation, we decided to stick out at woodlands itself and have dosas... all of us - roopa, shankar, madhavi, anitha, ashwini, dr.balaji, pande, om, me apara, smitha had different varieties of dosas - from spring dosas to masala dosas tp paper masalas to mysore masalas... It was served fast,m and it was good... But Dr.Balaji had to leave ear;y, and so he left us, but not before he PAID the bill, to our horror.. We objected to it, but he just said since we were students and he was H-1., he did it... We tried to ask the cashierto accept my card, but it was too late... I owe Dr.Balaji my whole b'day treat now... And he left for Gainesville... I made a mental note to pay back Dr.Balaji the next week he would come, and we finished our Dosa dinner, had a couple of snaps, and came out and decided to go to Baskin robbins for Icecreams... On the way back, I caled Pradeep - he had called me earlier but all I got was the voicemail earlier...on our wau to Baskin robbins, I spoke to Pradeep, he wished me b'day wishes and we spoke about other things as we always do... Smitha and Anitha told me I was too silent on the way.. may be I was contemplating about all the people i missed... But it was a great day too... We had our share of icecreams but unluckily I didn't have cash, so shankar helped me out - I had margarita ice wgich was slightly sour and very filling, I couldn't have all of it... It was 11:30 when I came back home... In half an hour I hit the bed, with the memory of a day that very soon became yesterday... (and now it;s day before)... And, my age is changing everyday... guess I'm growing everyday too...but I might only realise it next year on July 17th again... till then... let the time, age and maturity, come to me... I'll post the snaps soon... Just be a little patient... and everything else is fine... Ravi

      Kaalatheetha Vyakthulu What would you think of Indira, the "Nayika" of the novel "Kaalatheetha Vyakthulu" (Timeless People is too literal a translation ?) As I started out, just like all other characters in the novel, I found Indira a mean, manipulative and selfish woman. I had no problems with selfish. I had problems with her manipulativeness. So did Prakasham, the lover scorned, Krishna Murthy - Prakasham's friend, Kalyani - the sensitive victiom of Indira's manipulations feel about her. But Indira's manipulations arise from her dreams - her dreams to stand up, her dreams to live a good life, her ambition for her "rights" - and she's not bogged down by weaknesses. She refuses to cry at any stage, and if you are a cry baby, the whole world will conspire to make you cry. Is it the virtue of selfishness that Indira encompasses ? Or is she fighting to defeat the defeatist attitudes of Prakasham-like people? Or inspiring rich vagabounds like Krishna moorthy to find a direction? Or indirectly teach weaklings like Vaidehi to stand up and fight against the world for what you beleive is yours? for what you beleive must be yours ? She does all that. And much more. Kaalatheetha Vyakthulu, by Dr.P. Sreedevi, is an amazing attempt towards Objectivism ("virtue of selfishness"???). Written in the Post independence era, the novel talks of freedom - freedom to dream, freedom to do, freedom to acheive - through the character of Indira, a bold woman, who doesn't mind throwing the bricks that she doesn't want while buiding her beautiful house. Kalyani, a victim of destiny, losing her father, Prakasham, a place to live, et al. For most of the time, she's dependent emotionally on her father, and friends, until Indira's and Prakasham's betrayal opens up her eyes to the strength and belief she has in herself. Prakasham gives us an illusion as the hero of the novel to start with. But some one who can't decide what his preferences are, who his love is, and what he wants to do, can only be a spineless parasite.  In a way, Kaalatheetha vyakthulu is the discovery of Indira's character through the changing times and circumstances and of course, people. Through love, and war amongst personalities and consciences of people, Indira emerges as the heroine, who defines her life as she wants to live it. And so may be epitomising the heart of the Timeless People.

      The Art of Letting Go Dr. Alan Zimmerman's Comments:  Sooner or later, everyone you know will disappoint you in some way. They'll say something or fail to say something that will hurt you. And they'll do something or fail to do something that will anger you. It's inevitable. > Unfortunately, you make things worse when you stew over someone's words and deeds. When you dwell on a rude remark or an insensitive action made by another person, you're headed for deeper problems.  In fact, the more you dwell on these things, the more bitter you'll get. You'll find your joy, peace and happiness slipping away. And you'll find your productivity slowing down as you spend more and more time thinking about the slight or telling others about it. Eventually, if you don't stop doing it you'll even get sick. So what should you do the next time someone betrays you? TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR FEELINGS. Even though the other person may be at fault, even though the other person wronged you, you are still responsible for your own feelings.  In other words, other people do not "cause" your feelings. You choose them. For example, two different people could be told that their suggestions made at the staff meeting were "stupid and idiotic." One person may "choose" to feel so hurt that he never speaks up at any other meeting again. The other person may "choose" to feel sorry for the critic, sorry that the critic couldn't see the wisdom and necessity of her suggestions. As long as you blame other people for your feelings, as long as you believe other people caused your feelings, you're stuck. You're a helpless victim. But if you recognize the fact that you choose your feelings and you are responsible for your feelings, there's hope. You can take some time to think about your feelings. And you can decide what is the best thing to say or do. Then, you've got to learn to WALK AWAY FROM DISAPPOINTMENT. It's difficult to do, but it's possible. The famous 19th century Scottish historian, Thomas Carlyle, proved that. After working on his multi-volume set of books on "The French Revolution" for six years, Carlyle completed the manuscript and took volume one to his friend John Stuart Mill. He asked Mill to read it. Five days later, Mill's maid accidentally threw the manuscript into the fire. In agony, Mill went to Carlyle's house to tell him that his work had been destroyed. Carlyle did not flinch. With a smile, he said, "That's all right, Mill. These things happen. It is a part of life. I will start over. I can remember most of it, I am sure. Don't worry. It's all here in my mind. Go,my friend! Do not feel bad."  As Mill left, Carlyle watched him from the window. Carlyle turned to his wife and said, "I did not want him to see how crushed I am by this misfortune." And with a heavy sigh, he added, "Well the manuscript is gone, so I had better start writing again."  Carlyle finally completed the work, which ranks as one of the great classics of all time. He had learned to walk away from his disappointment. After all, what could Carlyle have done about his burnt manuscript? Nothing. Nothing would have resurrected the manuscript. All Carlyle could do was to get bitter or get started. And what can you do about anything once it is over? Not much. You can try to correct it if it is possible, or you can walk away from it if it isn't. Those are your only two choices. Sometimes you've just got to shake it off and step up. It's like the farmer who had an old mule who fell into a deep dry well. As he assessed the situation, he knew it would be difficult, if not impossible, to lift the heavy mule out of the deep well. So the farmer decided to bury the mule in the well. After all, the mule was old and the well was dry, so he could solve two problems at once. He could put the old mule out of his misery and have his well filled. The farmer asked his neighbours to help him with the shovelling. To work they went. As they threw shovel-full of dirt after shovel-full of dirt on the mule's back, the mule became frightened. Then all of a sudden an idea came to the mule. Each time they would throw a shovel-full of dirt on his back, he would shake it off and step up. Shovel-full after shovel-full, the mule would shake it off and step up. In not too long a time, the exhausted and dirty mule stepped over the top of  well and through the crowd. That's the same approach we all need to take. We need to shake it off and step up. Finally, you need to FORGIVE. It's difficult, especially when the other person doesn't deserve your forgiveness or doesn't even seek it. It's difficult when the other person is clearly in the wrong. Part of the difficulty comes from a common misunderstanding of forgiveness. Forgiveness doesn't mean that the other person's behaviour is okay. And forgiveness doesn't mean that the other person is off the hook. He's still responsible for his misbehaviour. Forgiveness is about letting yourself off the emotional hook. It's about releasing your negative emotions, attitudes, and behaviours. It's about letting go of the past so you can go forward to the future. Everyone in your life, everyone on and off the job is going to disappoint you. If you know how to respond to those situations, you'll be way ahead of most people. You'll be able to live above and beyond your circumstances. Action: Identify two people that have disappointed, hurt, or angered you. If possible, select two people towards whom you still have some bitterness. Then ask yourself, "How does my bitterness serve me? Am I happier holding on to it? Do I sleep better? Is my life richer, fuller, and better because of my bitterness?" If you find that your bitterness is hurting you, ake a decision. Actually decide to let it go. Walk away from the disappointment -- which means you no longer dwell on it or talk about it. Period!

      11:56 pm, June 2nd, 2004, Meenaxi... Have you ever wondered if existence is limited to "one" individual or a single "individuality"? What if we could lead more than one lives simultaneously, in different bodies, different circumstances, different minds and hearts, but the same soul...? If we cannot do it in this world of "real", is it possible in the world of surreal...?  And what would happen if one character from a book you are writing comes alive in front of you, and demands that it's story be written it's way...!!! What would you do...? Watch Meenaxi for answers...!!! If you would ask me, I wouldn't answer any of your questions on Meenaxi. Rather I would ask you to watch the movie itself. It might be difficult to grasp what the movie is about, what the director wants to say, and what's there to see. And it's like the painting of an artist, than the movie from a director (I guress this statement is only trivial). But yes, it is an experience to watch the movie and interpret it the way you want to. And there probably lies the mark of a director. He opens you up to show you what you want to see.

      May 31st, 1:28 AM Watched Pulp Fiction... It was pulp, amorphos, without form... Didn't understand the movie... But liked it... I had a fantasy about making a random movie... I think this is the closest I got to a deliberate random movie... But may be there;s something I don't see... Do I have to look deeper to understand this movie...? May be...!!!

      Lakshya is about finding your Objective... About a guy living in your door, inside you, who's confused about what the whole big life is about, and what his goal is. It talks about finding one's feet in the ground they are in. It tells us that anyone can define his "lakshya" (thats the word). It can be the lazy, confused, happy-go-lucky Karan who lands in the army more because of his ego than because he has a dream of serving his country. A guy with no ambition, direction and determination, who is happy to drift along till his father and girlfriend question and challenge his ego. And within the army he faces obstacles to be tackled, peaks to be conquered and enemies to vanquish. In contrast to the witty urban(e) comedy DCH, Lakshya is a serious war drama, but it's more a journey of self realisation. I liked the movie hazzaaar, but I would have liked if Akhtar had handled the lazy Karan metamorphosing to hero with a little more panache. I got more than I had asked for, which (fortunately or unfortunately), ended with my only asking more of it. Not that it left me complaining, but it left me wanting more... may be just a little more. Hope I do get my goal (and gal) the way Karan does...

      It's been a very stormy week here in Florida. Hot afternoons, humid middays, and rains in the evenings. And not just showers these were, these were the siblings of the storms, escorted by lightnings and thunders, threatening to steal any plans of a (American) Independence day weekend trip towards the west coast of Florida. But they weren't strong enough to bend the wills of the two first time drivers, who had just won their driving licence from the DL office in the Winter Park Office of Florida (lets just say FL). As the Friday drew closer, Srinivas and Ravi watched the skies, laying foundations to their will to get on with it, preparing themselves mentally to rent the car, and drive it, somewhere, anywhere.  It had been about two weeks since the four of them (Raja and Sandeep in addiiton to the other two) had received their driver's license. An acknowledgement of their driving sense. May be they were afraid of going out of touch, may be theirs was a juvenile enthusiasm to prove to themselves and to the world that they could drive long distances, safely, that they had decided to go on a long trip. It was certainly a delicate time, when you think that your acquired skill is good enough for the big thing, and you fight to bury your doubts and questions on your abilities as deep as possible in the ground. After all, it's confidence you need, to work miracles. So there they were, bubbling and restless like the lion cub, ready for it's first hunt of the deer.  For a week now, Srinivas had been hunting for places to visit in around Florida, invading the tourism sites on the internet, and zeroed in on four places: Fort De Soto Beach, Clear Water Beach, Tampa night life, and Caladesi Islands. It was decided that they would travel by ourselves, five of them (Raja, Srinivas, Ravi, Sandeep, Arun) unless someone wanted to come with them. Jay and Om volunteered to come with them, for a day, so that someone experienced, could accompany.  As friday approached, the four licensed friends started their discussions about their turns to drive. They were under the impression that only two drivers at most can be added on a car rental contract. Which two was their question. Sandeep was the first to sacrifice himself from the race, and Srinivas was the first to declare uphold his authority on the drivers seat. And that left Raja and Ravi to compete for the remaining position. Lady luck smiled on Ravi who won the "toss" thrice out of three times, to book his slot behind the steering wheel.  Before they were framed into Friday, the would be drivers made sure they had their homework, groundwork, carwork and drivework done, thanks to their wonderful neighbors Fakir (for his car) and Anousha (for her time). They needed that for confidence, they need that to atleast hope that the trip they were undertaking was going to be safe to say the least.  Friday had Om coming to Orlando, and shortly after him the rains came. The rains came not with ferocity, but with persistance, and they fell constantly, consistently. Gradually, the visibility turned low, the traffic became slow, the wind started to blow, and doubts entered their minds about all that would be at stake. They realised it was a bold step, and before they could think it was too bold of them to start off, they started off to the Enterprise car rental on Semoran, Srinivas, Ravi and Raja in Om's car, with Om driving. The rains gave them some taste of what could lay ahead. Road side pools, fog on the driving glass, lower speeds, spashing waters - driving in rain was a challenge on it's own. They were advised to either stay away from rain if possible, or excercise utmost caution.  Finally, the Enterprise was graced with the arrival of the soon to be Driver-heroes. It was still raining but the wind seemed to have come to a standstill. With great antipication forthe beautiful trip days ahead, Srinivas told the lady at Enterprise, "We had reserved a car for Friday evening at 5'o clock". He also wanted to tell her "Give it to us right now so that we can grab it for a drive", but his brain subdued this statement from his vocal chords into a mere thought in his cerebullum, that excited a few million neurons. "Yeah Sure, May I see your Drivers License Please", came from the lady which actually catalysed the whole subduing-the-speech-to-thought process in Srinivas.  "I'm sorry, but this is a temporary license, and we are not allowed to rent cars on this". "What!!" the drio spoke almost instantly, but each with a different lag from the time time the lady's sentence ended. A moment later when he realised that she had actually, really, said that, Srinivas retorted, "But I am sure this is valid, because my friend did rent a car from enterprise, and he too just had the temporary Drivers license ( TDL)". Ravi moved out of the room in a slight disgust, while Raja and Srinivas proceeded to negotiate with the lady. Ravi came back, seemingly resolute, and the drio decided to fight back. "I'm sure of this, my friend had rented a car on the TDL", "Do you mean to tell us that this is not valid, when it says that it in place of the permanent photo-IDied DL","We would like to talk to somebody about this, just to clarify, Please". May be Maria sensed the barrage that had been broken by her denial, may be she herself wasn't confident of what she had said, or may be she was trying to do her job, but she called someone again. And this time, she got it right, she got the drio smiling.  ******************************************************************  It was still raining outside, when Maria from Enterprise waded out of the backdoor of her office, keys in one hand, papers in the other, followed by our driver-trio (shall we call them drio- just to shorten things up). They walked towards a magestic car, radiating like a black body, with it's black body. As Ravi moved of the door and took his first look at the car, he felt a tinge of warmth in the slightly cold rainy weather. "It's the excitement", he heard his mind ring inside. His heart started to beat a little faster, as he involuntarily hastened his steps towards the car. He was the one who was the farthest from the car, and he was unlucky to have lost the race towards the car to Srinivas and Raja. Maria showed the drio the papers and the keys,  (Updated 07/10/04)  Om checked the car, and Srinivas assumed his authority at the driving wheel. Raja sat next to him, Ravi and Om behind. Om had got into the Gallant Mitsubishi so as to get to his car on car (it was raining so he would get wet on foot). As srinivas started to reverse, He could hear three voices screaming "right", screaming "left", scremaning "stop", screaming "go", and a host of other screams that he couldn't exactly make out. He also screamed something in between probably asking only one to speak, but since he was screaming too, all their screams moved randomly in the air, got mixed, mingled, scrambled and jumbled, and all he could hear was "rgoighttelfakelefstop", and the car ambled through the lane, and out of enterprise.  (Srinivas' Version)&nbsp; Lemme catch up with Ravi's Blog!Once Maria, the lady at the Enterprise office said " Ok, I'll go ahead and give you a car", at that moment, I was on cloud 9. I had lost all hope when she initially said we couldnt get the car. I, then, told her that I thought she was the meanest person on earth when she said she cannot give us a car! She said "Noo..please dont say that!" I had a sense of achievement, of getting the car! Once the paper work was done, Ravi, Shekar and I "ran" to the car, a Mitsubishi Gallant 2004 ! You could say that was my dream come true! Never did I imagine I would driving such an amazing car! Once the paper work was done, I was selfish enough to decalre that I would be driving the car that evening! And then started our first drive home! As soon as I adjusted myself in the seat, and got all ready to leave, a chill feeling went down my spine- a sense of excitement, a sense of fear too! 'What if something happens to the car?' Then suddenly I recollected Nishanth's words " There's always a first time for everything. And the earlier it is the better!" Also we had the entire insurance coverage. That's it. That thought made me confident enough to drive the entire trip! It was still raining heavily. I was initially a little worried about the clearance. It just took a couple of minutes for me to get the feel of the car and the spacing needed. In that rain, splashing waters on the road, I drove back to Khayyam, without a single fault. That was a real big accomplishment. As soon as we reached home, Jai and Pande were there welcoming us! Pande said " Now that you have driven in such a weather,I m damn sure you can drive anywhere in any condition". Well those words were also a big boost to my morale, which already was high up in the sky! I was scared I might get over confident now! So I decided to drive the car all by myself the entire evening. Well, yeah, I m sure Ravi and Shekar woould have definitely thought I was the meanest person on earth at that point!, but I was so overwhelmed by the thought of driving the car, nothing else bothered me!! Once we reached home, it was decided that Jai woudl treat us at Ahmed's , located on OBT. Ravi and I insisted on visiting the Shiv Temple as it was Guru Purnima, our birthday according to the Hindu Calendar that day, and also our first experience with the car! And I played the driver. With Jai as my guide, I felt I did a good job driving to OBT. We took Expressway 408 while going there. It was in a way my very first experiences on a Toll Road. I was kinda nervous initially, my hands started sweating, though I kept denying! But I had a sexy time. It was really cool driving at more than 60 mph all by myself! By the time we reached Ahmed's I was 100% confident of carrying the entire trip on my shoulder's even if Ravi and Shekar wouldnt have been there!After dinner at Ahmed's I decided, it wouldnt be fair on my part to keep driving and so gave the keys to Shekar. He pounced at them like a hungry cat! We reached home in about 40 minutes and decided that we must leave the next day by 7:30 in the morning. Om and Jai were more than happy to join us on the first day. They said they would be coming back by Saturday night. That night by the time we slept it was pretty late, dont exactly remember the time though. We tried burning some CD's. We could burn just 2 of them. One Tamil and the other Hindi. We were very sleepy and decided to call it quits for that day.Saturday- The day the voyage began! Three brave drivers were getting ready for their first ever road trip! Ravi was the first one to hit the road that day. Jai was there in our car as the navigator while Arun and myself were the passengers. We went to the gas station , got ice, cameras, gas and chips for the journey and we were all set to roll!And Ravi did an awesome job driving on I 4!!! I really didnt believe he could do it that well. He was really really good. Well, he had his own moments of "fear" which made us gasp for our life for a moment! He was pretty scared looking at a huge semi truck merging on to the freeway. He thought it was gonna hit us straight! And then without looking behind he moved into the left lane, and there came a HONK! Before we realised, there was an SUV going right next to us. Anyways once this incident got over, there was no looking back. He drove for a solid 2 1/2 hrs non stop! Even Jai was pretty amazed at Ravi's driving skills! The drive to Tampa Bay was great. Arun and I got a chance to see the backwaters of the Gulf of Mexico while travelling on the bridges connecting Tampa. In all our desperation we tried clicking snaps of the Downtown, the bridges, the backwaters, but nothing worked out as we were travelling so fast, nealr 75 MPH, couldnt see anything in the camera properly. Throughout the journey, the Tamil songs we copied , were played, and we ddint get bored even once. The collection was too good!After missing out the exit to Fort De Soto, and after some inquiries regarding the direction to Fort De Soto, we reached our destination at about 11:30 - 12:00 Noon. We first went to the North Beach. We could first see a huge parking lot with lots of greenery around. All of us decided to get into our swimming shorts, and jut then I realised I left my bag at Orlando! I hadn't brought it with me..Damn! I was wondering what I would wear for 2 days, that too we were going to beaches. We definitely will get wet. Then Om said I can share his clothes, he had a huge stock of them ready in his car! And so all of us went to the shore, passing through the woods. The first impresion on seeing the shore was "Beautiful" and "Bright". The sands were so soft and white, nobody would believe it was sand. It was more like Flour! Man....and then the waters...very very inviting! All that I remember was, we just plunged into the water and remained there for about 2 hrs. The waters were warm and really soothing.After a 2 1/2 hr journey, with the sun blazing hot right on top of our heads, the waters seemed like a heaven!

      S1   "It's time", Ramesh said locking his suitcase. I looked at my wrist, but found no watch there. For a moment, fear gripped me, and impulse reactions travelled down my spinal cord, jerking my hands towards my shirt-pockets, and then to my trousers. Within the moment, I realised that I had kept my watch safely locked in my - either the travel bag or the suitcase. With some uncertain certainty, I looked in Ramesh's direction, and found the big clock some way behind him, about to strike 5:00 PM. "It's time" I thought, and as if the lady had heard our thoughts, we heard her, "Your attention please. No:8888 New Delhi to Kanyakumari, Swarna Bharathi express West is arriving on platform no 7 shortly". She announced the same sentence verbatim in Hindi, and no sooner did she finish, we heard the distant "Cooo" of the train, we felt the ground we were standing on shiver, we saw the people on the platform getting silent momentarily (On hind memory I guess our ears were jarred for that moment), then we saw people getting busy, students, families, businessmen, husbands, wives, policemen, old couples, loud women, distracted men, getting ready with their luggage to get on to the train, getting ready to get on with their lives that seemed to have stalled on this railway platform.  "The arrival of train," Ramesh said, compelling me to abandon my search for the two ends of the train, and listen to him in anticipation of something interesting. "It creates so much of panic among people. People who have got reservations, people who know the train is going to stop for a while, still get very panicky when they hear the train come in" said Ramesh sounding amused. "Well, nobody wants to miss the train, no body wants to miss their seat" I countered, as the train came to a halting stop. "It's not so much about missing than it's about compettion - to be among the first", Ramesh re-countered, walking slowly towards his compartment. "The earlier you are in the lesser hassle it is" I said. We started to move towards S7, which was Ramesh's bogie. We had to move towards our right, against all the passengers hurriedly moving to the bogies on the descending side of 7. It wasn't as difficult, moving a couple of luggages that Ramesh had, as it was to wade through the opposing passenger flow. For a moment I wondered if the ones moving opposite to us felt the same, and I ended up smiling lightly, with a sense of discovering something as subtle as.... as dew drops on a petal.  We came close to the door of S7, and since we walked slowly to it, the crowd of passengers that usually cling at the door had thinned. Ramesh got into the bogie with his travel bag and I helped him with his suitcase. I got into the compartment too, dragging the suitcase till we reached seat No: 16. "I wish everybody had carried as little luggage as I do all the time, it makes so many lives easier", he said slightly panting. There were people around trying to settle their luggage under the sleepers, over the upper berths, towards the window (the waterbottles). Permutations were discussed, combinations were tested, deals had been made, arrangements had been agreed, wars were fought, treaties signed, and peace was restored before all the passengers started to settle. I figured out that the best place for me was the side of the window to ramesh's from outside, and I promptly came out.  "Not too many from our place this time on this train", I said. Ramesh looked at me as if I was stating something too obvious. I understood the reason behind the look. Soon my train will come, but it'll be so in contrast to the one Ramesh is in. While he's unlikely to go around the train looking to find people, there would probably be not too many looking out expecting to see him. We have been going to our homes every year, but this time it is different. We were going back, back to our homes, back to where our lives were going to take us. End of schooling is the end of a way of life as we knew it, so this was effectively the last time to say good byes. Somewhere deep down, we were optimistic of meeting each other, bumping into each other, working with each other, working for one another, but deeper down there was just this doubt, this apprehension, this misgiving that may be it'll be a long time before we can say "Hi" to each other again. Ramesh was least worried about saying goodbyes. And considering the fact that we were cross with each other a couple of days back, he might just have not expected me to come and say Goodbye to him.  I had come to the Xaviers Boarding school in Delhi when I was about to get into the 5th grade. My father, was a wealthy accountant, who was enamoured with distant lands and good education. But the only good education according to him was being an engineer or a doctor or a lawyer. You couldn't blame him for what he thought were respectful professions, for these were the three professionals he had&nbsp;felt for the part of his life could make more money than him. And of course, Collectors. But collectors though representative of high intellect, were, according to him mere gloves to the hands of bureaucracy. He hadn't seen too much of difference between a politician and a collector, and ever since I had written the right sequence of numbers from 1 to 50 when I was in the first grade in&nbsp;a small&nbsp;school in Hyderabad, he wanted me to be an Engineer. The engineer was one of the most persistent ambitions I had had when I hadn't known what it meant or what it entailed. But among all when-I-grow-up-I-want-to-be-an-xxx's that I would blabber in my golden days of ignorance and innocense the "I want to be... an Engineer" seemed to be a mantra that seemed to please and sober my father in his most delicate moments of thoughts, worries, anxieties, curiosities, misgivings, apprehensions about my future. In fact, for a long time, I was under the impression that the Engineer was responsible, among many other things (like building the dam, creating biggggu buildings), for getting the steam out of the train engine. Somehow, engine-engineer, seemed to just make some weird sense to me, and I had the engine-driver and the engineer synonymously coexist in my mind. But then, I was then too young to remember my past, or think of the future. All I was, was just being awed by the present.&nbsp; And so it was, my dreams already dreamt and re-dreamt in my parents' eyes. And along with their genes, and love, I had inherited them. Until now. It was after one whole summer of my being in Xavier's that Ramesh too found his way to the dormitory I was in. We were just 10+ boys then, and he had been admitted into the school by this then-fighting-now-divorced parents. Ramesh looked to me then like a shy, intelligent, nerdy geek, a thin frame, with thick glasses that escorted his eyes with a vision towards - infinity or nothingness, I didn't know then. I did not know about his or his parent's history, and I wanted to intimidate him in his early days (just like I was, in my early days). But something in him&nbsp;restrained me from doing so. I don't know if it was a feeling of sympathy for the boy-who-saw-into-nothing, or a feeling of awe for the geek-who-could-see-infinity. In fact, whenever he was around in the dorm, after the classes, after the evening cricket matches, after the dinners, I could feel some presence, an overwhelming presence of nothingness. It was as if you felt you were being followed, you looked back, expecting to dismiss your feelings, and eventually finding out that your feelings weren't illusions. For the first one week, the only conversations we have had&nbsp;living on adjacent beds were the dialogues of introduction, and occassional invitations from me to him for some outdoor games. Ramesh was polite in his conversations, but never reciprocated. He had carefully given me an impression that he never&nbsp;cared. Within a week, I had enough prejudices on him and I wondered how he would live the rest of his life without any friends.&nbsp;
