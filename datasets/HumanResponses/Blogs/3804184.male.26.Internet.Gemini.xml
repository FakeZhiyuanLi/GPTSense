        The blackout last night really freaks me out man, i tell ya, its strange and suddenly the scene from "escape from LA" flashes back to my head. The show tells of a government's secret weapon that can permanently destroy the electricity installation of any country in the world rendering them helpless without electric and living in total darkness at night....civilization goes back to the primitive ancient. Scary thoughts...but hey we are really not prepared if a prolong period of blackout strikes us. Who the hell can live without hot shower and air-conditioning? Damnit, the government should be more careful with the dealings with indonesia..the blackout was caused by the stoppage of gas from indonesia, oh damn how the lifes of singaporean depends on other countries, the feelin totally sucked.

        After my practical 6 for my motorbike lesson, those were the first 2 times that i have even feel the wind in my face when riding the bike. I'm able to move up to 5th gear and also to travel on normal roads. The kick and rush of adrenalin is awesome, very incredible. I totally love the feeling of riding in the wind, thats the way to describe the feeling oh yes!  I talked to a friend who have a class 2 license, the highest license for motorbike, which means he can ride any bike of any capacity. He told me with his current bike the Honda 929, he can travel at the top speed of 270km/h i was like "WOAH!!!". Yes that totally describe my feeling when he told me that, for me, when travelling at 50km/h i was already feeling very fast and mighty, and this dude actually travel at 5 times my speed or so....that is so incredible!!! But i really hope he can stop this kinda of stunts because the life is more important than speed. At 270km/h a small pebble on rthe road can make the entire bike overturn and the result would be dire!

         Well i guess i have been lazy and didn't really wanna write anything down the last few days or so. I always have the tenacity to get lazy about writing on the blogs or live journal or opendiary, i guess thats just me being a gemini and all. I have short attention span on anything hehehe.   My friend just sms me to see if i wanna join them in a&nbsp;club at orchard...well i would have love to if it wasn't for the fact that i'm already chillin at home relaxing and stuff. This situation also leads back to the fact that why didn't they inform me beforehand so i can definitely plan ahead and join them. I guess they just can't be bothered to invite me and only invite me when they get bored with no one to tell them funny jokes and stuff...hehehe....i guess i still have my usefulness. I felt pretty hurted cause&nbsp;if you want to call me to join you halfway after you had your share of&nbsp;fun, PLEASE don't bother to call me cause i won't come...period!  Had you really wanted me to go you would have told me beforehand, even if its 15mins beforehand i would have appreciate the fact, NOT when you people have already been there for a few hours.....*spit*

        Have a good time drinking last night with some pals, get to know a new friend call Sunny who shared with us his life stories or part of them anyway. He's a great drinker too but he goes down fast hahaha. Get to know a new waitress named helen at the pub, she's kool and all. I guess it must be the drink last night, i woke up with a splitting headache for most part of my day and until now. I just popped two penadol like 5 mins ago to try to curb the headache. I'm enjoying my off day today and i have a long weekend all lined up for me. Should be a good break from the routine work hehe.

        Lately i been giving tips to my friend for the copa america 2004 football games and thru my prediction i actually managed to help my friend win some $$$. Even tho i'm not betting on it myself, but its always nice to be able to help a friend. My friend loss some $$$ in the Euro games and now my tips have help him get back to positive on his winnings instead of negative hehehe...one thing is he keeps tempting me to bet too tho, i'm not really that interested...we'll see how it goes, maybe i will bet a game or two...or maybe i will just wait for EPL to start again...:)

        Woah, what a surprise when the bike instructor called out my number and told me that i have passed the practical 5 evaluation test!!! I thought i was a goner when i couldn't clear that red line in the emergency brake, but yet i passed, only 2 passed out of like 10 person and i'm one of the lucky 2! Its my 4th time taking this practical 5, the first 3 i flung badly. Anyway the first 3 times was taken last year and i think the break i took in between really did help me cause i seem to be able to ride better now that i have my car license, maybe the car driving experience does help me to do better and sharpen my sense on the road. I don't know, but currently i'm closer and closer to getting my bike license and getting my bike! Wooooo!

        Caught the show spiderman 2 earlier on, finally get to watch the show. Many of my friends have been telling me that its a great show and some even say its better than the first one. I was pretty skeptic about it and when i finish watching the show, i feel that its true, its really better than the first one and this one got a kool enemy for the storyline, lotsa fighting, web-swinging scenes and some kissing ones too hehehe. Overall the show is interesting and keeps me glue to my seat all the time, the story tells of the internal struggle of spiderman and the evil professor octapus with his iron swinging arms, very awesome!

        I feel kinda pissed today because a stupid end user dares to give me attitude. She have been telling me of this problem that she have on her pc, which causes her application to load very long and hang the computer. I have looked into the problem and suggested that maybe its because her pc is kinda old and to use this kind of memory intensive application hanging could happen and she also loves to open alot of windows at one time causing more lag to the processing. So this evening she call and told me that her application hang again, i ask her if its the PDF file problem, she told me that if she knows she wouldn't need to call me. God damnit how the FUCK can i help you if you fucking don't tell me whats the FUCKING problem is wrong, or tell me any error dialog etc. That really pisses me off, and i told her i need to know whats wrong before i can escalate the problem. She have the cheek to ask me if thats my answer...fucking bitch of a piece of crap! Then she ask if my supervisor is around and she will talk to my supervisor personally. FUCK it, talk all you want fucking bitch, cause you are a piece of crap in my eyes. How the fuck can i solve your problem if you don't tell me whats the problem. i rest my case!

        There was a farewell party today at my work place, two staff are leaving the company and this party is to thank them for their services for the company, nearly 90% of the staff turn up for the party. We had some white wine and red wine, soft drinks, some finger food and pizza. The management also take this opportunity to introduce all the new staffs to everyone in the company. I was introduced too, but well, everyone knows me already cause i'm have been there for two months or so already and being in the "IT" department, alot of people does come looking for my assistance hehe.

        Woah went for my first revision course on the bike earlier on, sure wasn't too easy as i have forgetton much about the stuff and route and there seems to be some new additional rules that have just been put in place and i have to learn the new rules...damn! I'm still not very confident on the figure 8 and the crank course i guess i have to do more practise on those two, i currently have 2 more revision course on thursday and saturday and then i will have my practical 5 on monday. I really hope that i can clear them all in one shot, that will be very awesome. I guess i have really spent too much time and $$$ on this bike license thingy and i promise myself that i must clear the license this time by hook or by crook. If one practice can't perfect it, practise it again, and again and again, i'm sure i will get it right sooner or later!!! gambatte ne!

        I found my long lost friend from primary school last friday, it all happens when one of my friend ask afew of us to go over to her regular pool saloon to play pool. Seeing that its a friday, we all agreed and went, upon reaching the counter of the saloon, i found the cashier dude very familiar, but i can't confirm whether he was my old classmate or not, so i just went on to play my pool game. Then suddenly my friend K, who was the regular there came over and ask me if i know the cashier dude because the cashier also told K that he find me very familiar, after a little questioning i found that he was really my long lost friend! I went over to the counter and have a chat with him and see hows he is coming along and stuff, it was pretty kool...so no i know which pool saloon to go to for cheaper rates muhahahah, i'm such a cheap skate!

        Its been a real busy day today, early in the morning the receptionist already call me to help them fix a printer problem ASAP, the worst part is i'm still halfway to work, damn they sure have some "early" problems. So i finally arrived and help them settle the issue, the whole place is busting with new students as the marketing people are having this new term orientation thingy whereby the new students will be given an orientation + a buffet breakfast for this first day affair. Mostly in the past the buffet always have leftovers and not abit but alot of leftovers, so i was there early helping myself to the food, pretty yummy stuff and i also save myself some money, so no need to buy breakfast hahaha.  Well anyway my supervisor only came around at about 2pm and the whole time before 2pm i have to work alone with so many things to do yet so little time and manpower to do it...*sigh*. Then i found out that my supervisor has work to 12 midnight for the last few days including sunday wooohaa, what a hardworking dude man! I should be like him?.....hahaha no way....all work and no play makes me a dull boy hehehe!

My sisters also planned to go to sentosa today to have a fun sunday at the beach, i should join them if i know the arrangement earlier, but i have already booked the ktv room and stuff and already meeting my friends so i guess i will have to pass this time round. Oh well...i'm sure we get the chance to go to sentosa again in the future...i never been there with them and our cousins, so i think it should be a fun time....:)Lets hope we all enjoy ourself this nice sunny sunday...wooo!

        I finally went and extend my bike lessons so that i can continue to take them over the next period of 6 months. J really re-kindle my urge to get the bike license as i'm already halfway thru it. A few months back I took both car and bike lessons at the same time and halfway thru the bike lessons i decide to stop my bike lesson and concentrate first on my car lessons, finally i managed to pass my car license last month. At first i always have this thought that since i already have the car license might as well just stop the bike lessons. After calculating the amount of money i need to spent each month on the car itself makes me understand that at my current stage, to own a car solely is next to impossible...unless i have financial support from my family else i don't think i be getting a car anytime soon... With this big issue in hand, J explain to me that i should continue on my bike lessons and finish it so when i get my license i can easily afford a decent first hand bike which is so dirt cheap now. I thought about it and felt her words was true and that owning a bike will sure beats the hell out of jamming in the crowded mrt every morning when i go to work...so its back to comfort driving centre for me...

        Lately i feel that i can't be staying at home during my off days, i feel that i should spend my free day going out with friends and enjoying life as it is. About afew months back i'm contend to be able to stay at home and play some games and chill out the weekends, maybe the "happening" virus is eating away at my heart and i can't seems to control the urge to go out and spend money and have fun, or maybe its because i have a stable income now and i'm able to use the money i earn whenever i want to. Oh well....

        I just had hot saucy roti prata for breakfast, its a kool treat...well i had roti prata for breakfast yesterday morning too hehe. Actually i wanted to eat some noodles this morning but when i reach my favourite noodle store, the type of noodle that i like has already been sold out...damnit...which is the reason why i eat roti prata again. Kinda sucky...duh..but anyway i'm not sorry that i ate roti prata...its good hot and saucy goodness with the curry sauce hehehe, SWEET! On a side note, damn the fairy tale of greece continues in the Euro as they beat Czech in a 1-0 affair in the extra time..thats bullshit..but somehow i have already predicted that they might win the game last night, oh well.

Her replies are short and i can't help but feel abit of irration in her msg, if there is even such a word hehe. Oh well maybe she is not feelin too good. I ask her if she is still interested in going to the asia bar tomorrow after work....her reply is "okay..." hmm very dubious reply...i really hope i'm not forcing her or maybe i'm interrupting her while she is doing something like watching a movie or something, oh well..i think i better stop msging her tonight....geez.

        Had a great dinner today, hanging out with my colleagues, we had some thai style food at the magic wok near capitol building. The place is just a few mins walk from my work place and being in the IT line and all, we usually work abit more harder then others, therefore by the time we reach there, alot of my colleagues are already there waiting for us. The reason for this dinner is to celebrate a farewell to one of my colleague who will be leaving the company in 1 weeks time. I guess she must be really stress out at her job cause i always seen her all busy and stuff, poor thing...maybe its getting to her health and mind, which is the reason why she wants to quit her job, or so i think. We had an enjoyable time eating and drinking and talking and gossiping at the dinner, we have such a big crowd that we need to join two 10 feet round table to accommodate all of us geez. The food was pretty okay, most of them are eaten up quite fast only the crabs are abit slow cause many are reluctant to dirty their hands on the crabs hehee. I, myself only ate one as a gesture of good will....hehe.chill crab and black pepper crab. Not so yummy when not eaten at home, i hate to make a mess when eating outside....icky.
