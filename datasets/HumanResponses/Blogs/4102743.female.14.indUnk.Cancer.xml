      I found this insanely pathetic web-site when I was surfing.  It's  urlLink www.24-7mission.com .  From what I saw in this web-site it had little tiny articles on things and then at the bottom it said plz pray for this or that.  Like there was one on the US olympics team and then it was asking you to pray for them.  What a bunch of bogus.  To pray about every little fucking thing in your life AND to try to get everyone else to do the same.  ugh!

      hey guys.  Well today I am proud to say I did.... nothing.  It was awesome I did some surfing on the net, watched some TV and well nothing.  It was one of the highlights of the summer.  I'm actually still in the PJs I wore last night.  hehe.  Well tommorow(technically today) I'm gonna wake up at 6ish.  ugh.  We're leaving for Portland, Oregon.  We'll be gone until Saturday late at night.  Don't worry though I'm bringing my lap-top with me so I'll still be able to post and talk about shit you guys truly don't care about.  I mean seriously.  Why the hell would you be reading my frek'n blog?  I'm 14 and clueless(compared to most 14 yr olds I'm genius though).  But whatever.  I love to have blog groupies.  Anyways if you guys know any kewl kick ass places to hang or eat in Portland TELL ME!  We've(Dad and I just us two) got pretty much everything planned but we can change stuff if we want.  We're gonna be eating some pretty good food!  YAY!  yummmmmy.  We'll be eating at The Horn of Africa, Hot Lips Pizza, Papa(someth'n italian).  and a bunch of good (non-American) food.  Well the other day I think I said something that my Dad keeps laughing about.  We were sitting in the Rosauers family restraunt.  And I saw these two old obeise ignorant looking people walk in and I said to my Dad, "The average American disgusts me"  And lately I've been thinking about it and it's true.  They're all ignorant and narrow-minded how else could you describe these millions of people who voted for George Bush.  I mean they all sit around watching TV, eating Twinkies, and talking about whatever the hell dumb red necks talk about.  ugh.  Sorry I am really grossed out by Americans a lot.  I need to move... again.  I mean they're just so STUPID!  ugh.  It's pathetic.  Well I better shut up before I insult someone.  ok more later when I'm in Portland.  later.  PS I can't find that ACLU thing you were talking about Tracy if you could comment this post w/ the address that'd be awesome.  I searched all over  urlLink www.michaelmoore.com .

      ugh... braces suck!  I can't eat a damn thing.  ugh.....  in sooo much pain and brushing my teeth makes it bleed and hurt WAY more.  ugh.... on to a different topic.  You should go check out  urlLink www.michaelmoore.com .  HE IS THE BOMB!!!  He is like my hero!  I e-mailed him.  Wouldn't it be insane if MICHAEL MOORE replied.  That would be sooooo sweet that would be the shit!  I just told him he was my idol and that i've loved ALL of his documentaries, and asked him what I could do in my community(as a 14 yr old) politcally to help get people to vote for John Kerry.  I wish he would reply that would be sooooo kewl!  That would make my day... no week... no year!  I mean he's MICHAEL MOORE!  I think if I could meet anyone I'd want to meet him!  ok well that's all for now.  more later!

       I get my braces in.... 6 and a half hours.  I am soooo nervous.  I've been waiting forever to get them!  I've decided on dark blue.  Well I was reading a blog(August Spie's blog) today and I learned A LOT about anarchism.  And I never thought I'd say this but I agree w/ a lot of it.  It's kind of weird.  I mean it would be something that should be tried out in one town to see how it works and then slowly grow if it works.  I'm not sure if it would work.  I have this feeling it would be kine of chaotic and also a little unfair.  But it would definetly be something that should be tested out.  I always thought that communism was a little stupid(mostly because of the way the public always presents it[like in King of the Hill]), but now that someone has broken it down and explained it to me it makes sense.  I definetly have to sleep on this and think about it.  I mean I agree a lot w/ the democrat point of view and also w/ the anarchist point of view!  What am I considered then?  hmmm.....

      hey.  The fucking blog thing is being retarded.  First it wouldn't let me make comments on other people's blogs and then it took forever for me to be able get on my blog.  Well I just got back from Joy's like a half an hour ago.  It was sooo  fun!  First we tried chasing sheep(she lives on a farm), then we played some music(me flute and her on cello[yes we realize we're geeks]), then we played some PS1(Crash Team Racing), we went swimming at the river, etc etc.  Anyways later that night at like 2:30AM we sneaked out and did a bunch of fun stuff.  Like we stuck some plastic forks in people's lawns(hehehe), we stuck pinecones in peoples mail boxes, we taped people's mail boxes closed, taped grass to signs, taped leaves to cars, turned sighns(like advertisement sighns) around so you just saw white, etc.  We did a bunch of that kind of stuff.  It was really fun and hilarious.  Next time we want to get like a hundred plastic forks from the dollar store and put them all over people's lawns.  Last night we only had like 10.  We didn't want to do any really mean stuff like tee peeing(sp??) or egging people's cars.  We didn't want to get caught and get in trouble.  Well we didn't caught.  Your probably wondering about the title why it says Joy's cave.  That's, because Joy doesn't have TV and doesn't always know much about the outside world.  Like ...... she hasn't seen a  bunch of awesome movies, she's not familiar w/ famous people(like Shane West[omg he's hot!!]), and just little weird things like that.  So we say she lives in a cave.  Well that's all I've got to say.  later, PS I get braces in two days!!! PPS thank goodness your back Papercut!

      omg! Paintballing is awesome!!!!! I love it! And I am the bomb. I went to Lauren C's b-day party which was paintballing. We played one game where we were just in the woods shooting each other. Then we played like four game of bunker. I love bunker it's awesome! How it works is there's this fort type thing on top of this hill and there are usually two or three people in the fort, and then everyone else(5 or 6 people) try and capture the fort. If you get hit you die and have to leave the game. And if people sneak up to the fort they can take over it. Well I didn't die in any of the bunker games. I was in the fort once(it was kewl but I like it better when your attacking) and twice I was sneaking up the side of the hill(in the bushes) so we could surprise them and conquer. Then the last game I was the bunny(the person who distracted) and I must say that they SUCK! I mean I was running around and waving my arms and they really sucked and couldn't hit me. Well when they started to shoot at me(which was good cuz Lauren C. ran out of ammo) I had to literaly jump in the bushes and that hurt a bit.  Anyways it was awesome being the bunny and then the other players got up to the top of the hill. But they sucked and weren't shooting them or charging so I thought fuck this. And ran/sneaked up to the fort and pointed my gun at Lauren M and said, "GET OUT!!!!". And she said, "ok ok I surrender" HAHAHA!!! I was the only one to win the game during the whole day! I rock! Plus I'm just a newbie. I only got hit twice(which really doesn't hurt much just kind of scared me cuz it took me by surprise) and that was on the first game. Gosh I love paintballing. Next time I play I wanna play some better people cuz they were all girly girls(who screamed really loud when they got hit!) and I am the bomb compared to them. Surprisingly enough though the paintballs left these red spots on me. I didn't expect that I mean they barely hurt! Anyways Joy if you want to go paintballing I'd love to go w/ you and Neverwood is a really awesome place it's huge. well later people. PS where are you Elijah(Papercut) you need to do more posting!!!!

      It's official my best friend hates me. I don't get it. So I got angry that she wouldn't listen to me and I hung on her? Like omg! ugh. This is sooo dumb. And I can't call cuz that's exactly what she's waiting for. She even told me that when we get in a fight she always waits for me to call. It reminds me of my parents before they got divorced. My Mom would have a huge fit. And my Dad would apologize for no damn reason. I can't believe you Whitney! This is sooo dumb! Why don't you be the bigger person for once and call! huh? I mean if you don't who are you going to go on your big before school shopping spree w/? Who are you going to have the book club w/? Who are you going to complain about your family to? Who are you going to discuss Budhism w/? Who are you going to do dumb stuff w/(piercings[we need to re-do our belly buttons!] and dye hair[I'm dyeing mine purple soon!])? Plus who are your parents gonna hate from your friends? They would never hate Cammila or Jessica! Come on Whit call cuz this is soooo dumb! ok love ya. later people! PS Elijah where are you? You haven't done any recent posts! PPS I'm going paintballing tommorow! :-) Time to whoop some Christian Republican preppy girly girl ass!!! muahaha!

      Just got back from the dentist I got seperaters.  They don't hurt.  I already had them once before.  I'm getting braces in 5 days!!!!  Well anyways!  I don't understand why 50% of Americans think Bush should President again!  I mean how dumb can you be!?!?!  If a fucking 14 year old can tell how full of shit he and 50% of Americans over 18 year olds can't tell then there is something terribly wrong.  It just pisses me off how ignorant people can be.  I mean this guy is ruining the best country in the world(in my opinion).  And people are letting him!!!  I mean Bill Clinton had affair and people tried to impeach but this bastard is HORRIBLE he hasn't done one good thing while he was in office and people aren't doing anything!!!!!!  What does it take to get those fucking republicans to admit they made a frekin mistake putting him in office!!!!????  He is pure evil I swear!  Gosh I think there should be an IQ you have to take to be able to vote.  Cuz a lot of people that vote don't know ANYTHING about ANYTHING let alone politics.  And don't even get me started on my generations.  Like Kimmy for example when I try to talk politics w/ her she says, "oh Gina I'll learn about politics when I'm 18 and can vote".  ugh!  And my retarted Christian "friend"(she gets pissed because I swear a lot and cuz of what I wear) says she likes Bush becaus he's better looking that Kerry.  ugh!!!  how dumb is that???  I am soooo worried about the future of this country!!  The anarchists just might get what they want!  Be happy Elijah the state is falling to pieces!  later people,

      HAHAHAHA!!!!  omg.  There's this web-site that shows you how to be punk.  lol.  It's soooo fucking hilarious.  And they have this Insta Punk Kit that you can buy!!!  It's got high tops and ripped up clothes it's hilarious!!  And then it tell you how to have the right punk attitude.  And tells you that you should say, "oi, oi , oi" a lot.  And it also tells you what kinds of things you should doodle.  hahahaha.  It says NOT to doodle bats or flowers or naked chicks.  Yes naked chicks would not be a punk thing to doodle.  HAHAHA.  This is too good to be true.  What retards made this web-site.  .... it says how that Blink 182 is no longer considered punk and that you should now all bow your heads down to your new punk g-d.  Rancid!!!  ....... here's a little paragraph to show you how gay they are!!  Collect CDs of every band you hear as being referred to as Punk, Ska, or even Hip Hop! Who cares if you don't like  urlLink Goldfinger  or  urlLink Black Flag ? If you have the CDs, the mohawk and the look, you must be a punk! You'll like them eventually, if you listen to them enough... hahaha!!  how dumb is that!!!!  Why the hell would these people want to be punk if they don't like this shit!!  haha.  What a bunch of poseurs.  later,

      I just got back from the mall. Gosh I hate that fucking place. ugh. All those stuck up preps walking around and they look at you like your some piece of shit. I HATE THEM!!! They need to rot in hell w/ all those stuck up republicans and fucked up Christians who judge me for being Jewish. Anyways... I bought this sweet long sleeve dark green shirt. I think it'll be perfect for paintballing. I just need to cut it up a bit or do something to it. I also went to Barnes and Nobles to get the sound track to Wayne's World for Lauren. It's got some sweet songs on there by, Alice Cooper, Queen, Jimi Hendrix and other kewl dudes. But they didn't have it and the perky salesperson was all, "I can order the CD for you.... want to get a Barnes and Nobles card????.... can I help you find anything else???...." They're so annoying but I guess it's there job. How the hell do they do it??? I don't think I'll be a waitress or sales person like that cuz I could never be so perky. Well my Dad is going on a date tonight. I guess I'm happy for him, but the girl is like 38 I mean that's like 15 years younger then him! oiy. It's really cute how nervous he is. I mean he's asking me what he should wear, and everything. hahaha. It's like Junior High all over again! Ya I remember my last date. That was the most lame thing ever. ugh. He turned out to be a stupid preppy lying bastard. He had another gf all along. And he ended up dumping me(mostly cuz I was(not anymore) a cutter. And I think that he was afraid that I would commit suicide if he dumped me. Like I would give up my life for that bastard. ugh. I can't believe I ever liked him!!!!!! oooh.... found an intresting site.  urlLink www.anarchism.net . wow I'm learning a lot! Did you know there were Christian Anarchists??.... Well that's all for now. later,

      ugh..... so sick.... Gosh I log on here and as usual people are complaining about me. Fuck.  I am sooo tired of my friends calling me and complaining about ridiculous shit like how there perm didn't turn out the way they wanted.  I mean they get whatever the hell they want, live in big houses, with a whole big happy family and yet they still find shit to complain about.  I mean they don't know what it is like to live off of Welfare, they don't know what it's like to spend half the nite lying in bed listening to your parents scream there heads off at each other, they don't know what it's like to move every couple years and somehow make friends and a new life for yourself.  They have no idea what real problems are.  They live such a fucking sheltered life.  I am soooo sick of it.  ugh!!!  I mean go tell someone who gives a crap.  And then when I try to tell them that there "problem" is no big deal they get all huffy and say, "You don't understand".  Well you know what I don't understand and I doubt I ever will.

Anyways I realized how retarded Blink 182 and GC are.  I mean they're just preppys who's complain about retarded shit that everyone has to deal w/.  I don't know about me being a punk cuz well I'd love to be punk(and I'm slowly proggressing towards it) but my parents would rather have me dead(a little exagerated) than me be punk.  I mean they have a heart attack every time I wear black nail polish.  ugh.  They piss me off.  Anyways I'm soo psyched cuz I'm going to my friends "b-day party"(kinda 3rd grade) anyways!!  We're going paintballing.  But some of her friends well they piss me off they talk shit about me behind my back about all the guys I've gone out w/.  And well I'm kinda glad they're going cuz I'll be able to whoop there asses!!  haha.  Bitches.  They are sooooo full of themselves and just because no human alive would go out w/ them, they have to get pissed at anyone who's had a bf.  Gosh they're all just rich snooty preps.  later, Vote.....

      Today I was looking at my friend Joy's blog and some retard was all complaining about how Joy and I always talk about politics and that we should give it a rest. Well to that peron I say(not suitable for children) FUCK YOU BITCH!!!!!! gosh. I mean it's OUR blogs. And I don't know about other bloggers, but I'm not out to please others I'm out to talk about whatever shit I want to. If I want to talk about stuffed animals, or how Nirvana rocks or John Kerry I will!! And I will enjoy doing it and will not give a shit what others think!! ugh. Now that I've said that I'll move on. Whit and I kinda had a little fight. I don't know I just got a little angry cuz I always listen to her talk(for hours) and I'm good I listen and sympathize and all that crap. And today I hadn't had a good day and just wanted to talk but she was watching Scary Movie 3 and she couldn't listen to me for like 5 min. ugh. Well I don't know if she's pissed at me cuz I kinda hung up on her. But should I be angry at her????? I don't know I'm not really. Well Whitney if your reading this. I'm not gonna apologize(why should I???) but let's not get into a whole stupid fight. ok?? love ya!! ok well that's all I gotta say for tonight. later people. ~Gina

      ugh. My Dad is really beggining to piss me off!! I mean he's worked all week(I can understand that) and I've been good and not complained. But then I wake up an hour and a half later then what he wanted(I woke up at 11) and he tottaly(or totaly or tottaly or tottally....) freaks out!! ugh. Anyways we saw Spiderman 2 today. It really sucked. It's just your average Hollywood blockbuster movie for your average obeise(sp!?!?!) American. I mean I guess for the average American it's okay. They can go watch the retarded movie, eat Micky D's, go home and watch satellite TV. But I'd like to think or learn from what I watch, or atleast be etertained. The cinematography sucked, the music was well I don't remember so it couldn't have been that great, the acting was okay, and the plot was stupid. ugh. I don't mind movies that weren't made great but they have to be entertaining. The three movies I really want to see this summer in the theatres are Napolean Dynamite, Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, and that Metallica movie. The movies.... (really good Green Day song is on just a sec...)... I want to rent are Danny Darco(Sp!?!?!), Moulin Rouge, and The Blaire Witch Project(hopefully I'll be able to watch more than the first 5 min. w/ out getting a head ache). Crap I better go to bed befor my Dad gets pissed. Peace out. ~Gina

      I'm kinda copying Joy's recent post although I wanted to do this for a while on my Blog.  Top 10 Reason to Hate(and NOT vote for) Bush 10)He's stupid and ugly! 9)He has an evil laugh more of a chuckle, it gives me goose bumps!! 8)He's a dirty lyeing bastard. 7)He's against gay and lesbian marriage 6) He doesn't care about our forests 5)He only cares about oil and making $$$$$. 4)He's in office when he didn't win the 2000 election. 3)He has Dick Cheney as Vice President 2)He has our troops over in Iraq dyeing and murdering (innocent)people for no reason!! 1)He's not John Kerry.  PLEASE!!!  Don't have for George Bush elected again, do your part and vote for John Kerry.  If you really don't like John Kerry or could never vote for a democrat atleast vote for Ralph Nader instead of Bush.  Thankyou for listening to what I have to say!!

       OH!!! I forgot to mention this!! I am so fucking happy with myself even though it's a small acomplishment. But I've lost 3 pounds!!!!! YAY!!!! My frekin diet and exercise is working and I've barely been doing it for a week!! I'm sooo happy. I've made so many different little changes like instead of ice-cream it's low fat frozen yogurt. And my stomach has DEFINETLY shrunken. I mean I used to be able to eat like the whole fridge!! And now I eat a piece of meat and some veggies and I'm full. YAY!!! :-) When I reach 5 pounds I think I'll....... eat a donut.... no a Krispy Kreme donut!!! And when I reach 10 pounds I'll do someth'n bad like pierce my belly button again(I've done it and it's not as painful as it is in the movies but definetly more complicated!).... no I' won't pierce anything I'll..... hmmm..... I don't know what I'll do but I'll be thinking about it a lot. Wow I can't believe I lost 3 pounds! I've never lost any weight in my life well I have but not on purpose. This is my first diet thing that has actually worked and it's not Slim Fast or Weight Watchers or Atkins or counting calories it's....... Slimmer Yourself. Ya that's what I'll call my diet Slimmer Yourself. Gosh I'm a total nerd. hehe. oh well. Well I'll keep you posted on my progress. Keep Rockin- Gina

       I get my braces on in exactly 2 weeks!!!!! yay!! Finnaly!! I know it' insane that I WANT braces, but my teeth aren't exactly Miss America type smile worthy or whatever. But I'm really not sure what color rubber bands I should get??? I've narrowed it down to- blue and purple, blue and black, or purple and black. I have light brown hair and blue eyes. If that helps!!! I'm eating a lot of gum lately I'll miss gum!!!!! (tear) I figure that for a couple days after I get my braces I'll be eating soup and mashed potatoes.... what else can I eat??????    ~Gina   PS PLZ post comments on what I'll be able to eat and what color bands I should get!!!!

       I'm listening to Nirvana!!  I love that band.  It's my favorite band.  It's so sad that Curt Kobain commited suicide though.  He was a great musician.  Not to mention he was hot.  But anyways!!  I think my band that me and my friends are going to make should be kind of like Nirvana/the Donnas/Finger Eleven.  But I want our songs to be about something other than love!!!  I think I'd like to write a song about how stupid Anarchy is, how dumb Bush is, expectations(from parents, teachers, friends, etc), and stuff like that.  I'm going to play bass.  I'm not doing all that homework my Dad's given me for no reason.  He'll buy me a guitar at the end of the summer(if I do all the summer) and then I'll save up and buy a bass, amp, and all that stuff.  My friend Whitney will be singing vocals, because she's a good singer and because she can't stick to instruments.  hehe.  I mean she played piano..... she quit piano..... she played violin....... she quit violin........ she was in percussion...... she quit percusion.  You get the idea!!  Well I still love her and she'll be an awesome lead singer!  My friend Joy will be playing drums.  She's already been playing for a year and well she kicks ass!!!  Plus she's got the drummer look nailed(if there is a look for drummers..... I thought there was....) and I know she'll practice!!  She practices her cello like 3 hours every day so I know she can practice the drums for atleast 45 minutes everyday or so.  It'll be a really kewl band.  We just need to find someone to play guitar.   hmmm....  oh well.  We'll find someone in the next 6 months.  I keep thinking of names for the band and then I'll be at Borders or somewhere and see that there is a band already named that!!!  I wanted Misfits(taken), Nerds(taken).  So I'm thinking Forevermore.  Whit wants something like posha or somethin' it reminds me of Posh Spice.  I don't think Posha or whatever would be that kewl(sorry Whit!!).  Oh it's Lithium I love this song!!  .........I'm back.  So if you have any cool ideas for a (rock) band please send a comment with some ideas!!!  thankyou.  later,   ~Gina

      You know what??  I just realized(when I went to the mall today) that they make beach towels 6ft by 7ft.  You know when you get a towel that's that big that you need to lose weight!!  Speaking of losing weight I'm on a diet and I'm exercising.  ugh I hate it.  But I want to lose like 10 pounds before school starts!  I really will be different then!!  With braces, short hair, turqoise streaks in my hair, and hopefully contacts!!  Plus my new look.  I'm wearing my fav. shirt.  My Itchy and Scratchy shirt!  I like it a lot!  It's comfy and kewl.

       T  oday I am reading the book Smack it's really good. And just for the record I don't do drugs and never have. It's about these to run aways(who are 14) and they get addicted to heroine. It shows you how messed up drugs can be, I'm not saying that's what happens to everyone that takes drugs. I will tell you later how the book goes.    My Dad made me wake up today at 10:30 and was angry that I didn't get up an hour earlier. Why?? We're not doing anything today?? Why do parents do things like that?? I will never understand my parents. Everyone says that when you get older you turn into your parents, I sure hope not. I mean I love my parents and all but I'm not sure if I want to be like them.    Well I better go practice my flute(it's feeling lonely),   ~Gina

       A few things about me- I hate Bush(that ass), I love rock, I play the flute, I am Polish(and proud of it!![gosh Joy!!]), and well I have a lot to say!!              First off this has been on my mind for a couple of days. Why is Mt. Everest called Mt. Everest??? And who came up with that name?? I mean whouldn't you call it Mt. Everwork or Mt. Everbig or Mt. Evertired. Why rest, I mean your doing anything but resting!!!              Well next subject! Politics. What's with Bush?? I mean why does he lye to us?? WHy does he have to finish his Daddy's job?? Doesn't he realize that he's just like destroying the best country ever!?!?! He should go see Farenheit 9/11 so he can learn his mistakes if he's really THAT stupid!! Anyways EVERYONE should vote for John Kerry because he is the BOMB!! Check out his web-site   urlLink  http://www.johnkerry.com   . check it out!    On to the next subject..... my b-day was on the 6th of July and if you didn't buy me a present that's okay you can still give a present any time!! jk. I am 14 and I can't wait to start High School. ugh I'm nervous because of all those Hollywood Blockbuster movies that make High School seem like hell! But it can't be that bad!?!?! Will I won't get a swirly, sit in the front row of class and the teacher is a spitter, get brainwashed by the mean girls, or get detention 5 times a day for no reason. Cuz seriously we live in reality and that never happens.... does it.....??    Next!! Can you believe that it's summer vacation and I have h/w. Yes my dad is strange. He gives me essays, vobab, reading, math(ugh I hate that!!) and flute practice(which I actually like and would do anyways!). But I mean how unfair is that!?!?! I'm writing an essay about my brother now. It really stinks. I'm not the best writer! hehe. But the vocab is easy 5o% of the words I already know but I'm not gonna tell my Dad that!! Let him think I'm dumb if he wants! ugh. Well that's all I better get reading. later,    ~Gina
