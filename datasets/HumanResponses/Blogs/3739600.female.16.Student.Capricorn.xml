        Ok well I have learned another lesson in life! A very hard one but needed! You really can't place your heart in anyones hands and not have it broken! The only one you can trust is the Lord. He knows how to treat you and he can be trusted with anything! So I am going to forgive all who have hurt me, forget it ever happened and just move on. No need to ponder anymore! I just hope that all of those I have hurt will forgive me as well! Ta-ta!          Much love, Brandi*    urlLink          urlLink

      Wow, stunning how time can take a toll. If we are to deliberate ourselves and just talk about everything and anything, we are able to see through our afflictions and worries. And most of all we can work things out! In the width span of 2 1/2 hours he and I connected like never before! It felt so wonderful and traquilizing! I am so glad we had our talk. I hope on many levels we are some what closer! Time is such a vunerable yet a inpregnable tool we all use to keep order and stability. But some times just forget about all of the clocks and watches; do what ever the hell you want! Trust me, it really heals and revitalises you.  Much lov, Brandi*

        Man I can't stop it. No matter how hard I try, there's no changing the way I feel. It's hopelessly sad! I can't believe I still feel this way after all that has exploded between us! Plus, truth be told, I don't think he cares much for me anymore! I'm not trying to be sarcastic/dramatic or whatever it's called! I just feel that way. I maybe wrong but I could almost promise that's what it is. Maybe that's  one  of the reasons I am joining the army!...To run away. Not only my dad but from my feels for him. I don't want to stop loving but I think it would make things easier for me. Don't ask how because I think I am just gabbering & and making up excuses! I am so sorry for all the crap he went through just to make it work. I know for a fact have said that many times before but he doesn't realize just how sorry I really am. I would cry so much when I got home, after school! I have to admit that there were many times where I wanted to give up. Not because I didn't want to be with him but because I didn't want him to go through so much shit! To me, I'm not worth all the trouble! He doesn't understand how much he means to me! And to see him go through the things he did, hurt me so much! I have never loved anybody the way I love him! I didn't even have to think twice about  us getting together! I felt so happy and comfortable around him! I told 'em things I could never tell my life long friend, to whom I have known since I was three years old! He knew me inside out and I placed all my trust and love into him. he is the best thing that has happened to me! I just can't believe it all had to end! I don't ever want to say good-bye but at the moment I don't know what to do anymore! I just want to stop hurting.....Please tell me you'll always be there for me. If not as my boyfriend, as my best friend! I promise you, I'll always be here for you. If you ever need anything or you just need to talk, don't be afraid to pull me off to the side!       Always      Brandi*

      Why is it when my parents argue, it's always about me? I'll try not to complain but I just need to get things straight. I try so hard to be the perfect child both of them want me to be but it's just not me. I don't have the normal teen life all the others do. I don't go to the movies every Friday night, I don't go to the occasional birthday party, nor do I go hang out at the mall with my friends. I turn down offers to go to schlitterbahn or six flags and I barely talk on the phone anymore. I try not to ask for too much and I am always keeping to myself. But My dad just has to find something to stick on me. He always brings up the past and the stupid things I have done. Yes I know I make mistakes but with that I ask for your forgiveness and plus it's over with and he should learn to let them go. Even when I'm not bothering anybody and I am sitting in my room, he will get all upset because I am always in my room. But when I'm not in my room we always get into confrontations. So I don't know what to do. And see the worst thing is when my mom tries to stand up for me. When she does, she and my dad get in to these huge arguments. Once I turn 18, I think it were best if I were to get out of this house as soon as possible. I love my parents and you know I wouldn't be able to live knowing I split them apart. As it is I hate knowing that I am the main reason for all the tension I this house hold. So Lord, please help me and please don't leave my side.       Love Always, Brandi*

        Well today is surely a lot better than yeasterday! Since&nbsp;my&nbsp;good ol' buddy Clayton&nbsp;was at work yesterday and was around some friends I really didn't bring up anything about my day! We mainly talked about all the other shit that's stinkin' up our lifes! But after I got off the phone with him&nbsp;I called another friend. At frist I was kind of afraid to say anything but he knows me better than anyone out there, so he knew something was up.&nbsp; I finally broke and he sat there and helped me sort things out. I'm gald to know that he&nbsp;is there because he wanted to be my friend, not just to be seen with me! Yes still have those questions flowing through my head but it's not as pianful to think of anymore.      Much Lov, Brandi*

       Today is surely not to good of a day. I feel like I am going crazy! Why can't I change the way I feel? Why can't I choose who I can and can not love? Why do I give a flying rats ass what my father thinks? Who the hell am I? Why do I hurt so freakin' much?! How am I able to hide so much pain...how do I manage to keep it all in so that no one knows?     &nbsp;  Where are you when I need you?

       Back once more! Today has gone by pretty fast! I guess that's a good thing.    Today I need to talk about something very important...It's the steps    I " will"     be taking as soon as possible! I am going to join the Army and that's final. I don't care if I am sent over seas to fight and I don't care if my dad stays disappointed in me for the rest of his life(  HIS LOSS, NOT MINE  )!... My Uncle has a better chance of being sent over seas than most of his flight, my best friend has men and women in his same unit&nbsp;&nbsp;who are being deployed in less than a month! I'm not going to just sit here and twiddle my thumbs&nbsp;while they risk their lives for me. I'm sorry I just can't do that!&nbsp;I may let a lot of people down (especially family)&nbsp;but I rather do what I feel is right, than live a free and&nbsp;meaningless life.&nbsp;Just because I am going against their wishes doesn't I don't love them and that I don't need their prayers. I was placed on this earth to do something with my life and for some reason the Army is what I really want to do with my life! I want everyone to remember that   FREEDOM ISN'T FREE!  &nbsp;&nbsp;Laterz!     &nbsp;   Loving you always!&nbsp;    Brandi Marie*

       Hey it's me. Well I'm feeling a little better,&nbsp;now. Last night didn't turn out to well but it's all good. For now, we are just going to but friends. At least till things melow out a little. Then maybe later now down the road something will happen and actually last. I really love him like no other&nbsp;but for now I guess just being his friend would be for the best. He's so busy working and trying to get things going that I&nbsp;really don't mind&nbsp;slowing&nbsp;things down between us. I wish him the best and only the best.     &nbsp;  Lov&nbsp;Always,   Brandi*&nbsp;

      Well what can&nbsp;I say. It just had to end...but I&nbsp;guess it was for the best. Even though it doesn't feel like it. We're still really good friends, so I can't complian. It's better than nothing at all. I just really wanted it to work out. I had really strong feelings for him. I think that I really a breakoff of relationships for some time(avery long time). I still love him more than anything and I always will. I&nbsp; can't change how I feel for him, so I'll just live with it. I wish him the best and hope to at least remain friends with him.  &nbsp; Lovve always, Brandi*

          Hi it's me again. Well, all is going good.&nbsp; Tommorrow I will be going out with my uncle(just the 2 of us. you know with out my aunt!) He called today to see if I wanted to go somewhere today but I wasn't here when he called. :(&nbsp;So by the time I got&nbsp;his messege it was already 4:00pm!&nbsp;My bro sucks at giving me my messeges&nbsp;but at the same time I am too!&nbsp;So I called him&nbsp;and him a few hours ago and&nbsp;We will going out tomorrow, instead! &nbsp;I haven't been able to spend time with him since I was little...so I am really happy. But anypooh, I turned my&nbsp;application today. Hopefully they call me back and I get the job. That way I have a reason for getting out of work!:) The application was for a resturant not but 10 minutes away from my humble lil home! The manager really seemed to like me, so I hope that she likes me enough to give me the job. well I guess that's all for now! I'll get back to you later.        &nbsp;    Much lov,      &nbsp; Brandi*&nbsp;

      Hello there. At the moment I have nothing to do but confine in you. Some good and some a little worse than others.  Truthfully, I don't know what to think anymore. It's like I can't stand to be without him but that's what I'm doing right now!!! I haven't seen him but twice this summer. It sucks so much. What is happening? I try so hard to make everything work but he's just to busy and for some reason I...awwww forget it! Maybe everyone was right, maybe I should have left him alone. But of course I'm too hard headed to see that. All I listened to was my heart and nothing more. I guess the old saying "love isn't enough" is true. I know that if I go to anyone, all they are going to say is that 'I told you so.' Maybe not in those words exactly but pretty close to it. Man does it's suck to try and change the way you feel...Why the hell do I even care for him so much anyways...I know later on down the road he's going to have to leave weather he wants to or not. So why do I try so hard to hold on, anyways? It's so hard to put into words but all I know is that I care for this guy with all my heart and not being able to see nor speak to him really hurts. Please help me, I have no idea what to do?      Ok, I really think I should move off that topic. It's a really shitty thing to talk about. In other news, my dad is going to to be getting a job soon. An long awaited dream come true for my mom. The only thing is that, he'll have to move to El Paso. I think him leaving will be a good thing for me. I love my dad but we just can't stand each other and space will be a God given gift for the both of us. I just hope all works out according to plan.   Well that's all I have for now. I'll drop in later.   Much love: Brandi*

      Hi it's me again! Well at the moment I am thinking of the one to whom I love so much. A lot of people(such as my parents, brothers and even my friends) don't see why I care for him as much as I do. Some times I forget why, as well. But then again, why do I have to have a specific reason for loving a person? Plus it's none of their business. Lord I understand that he and I wont be able to see each other that often when school starts but please give us the strength to hold on to each other and stay true to one another. Help our love grow stronger as each day goes by and protect us from all that is bad and from those who will try to tear us apart. Please be with us each and everyday. I love him to much to let him go again.   Brandi*

GRRRRRR! oh and that they have 8th off and I left my bookbag in clayton's truck.....MY MAKE UP IS IN MY BOOKBAG!  urlLink    I got to see my big bro. during lunch! I can't believe I am saying this but it was good to see him. Ok well I have to get ready for D.E. So I'll drop in later!  Much love, Brandi         My inner child is sixteen years old!   Life's not fair! It's never been fair, but while adults might just accept that, I know something's gotta change. And it's gonna change, just as soon as I become an adult and get some power of my own.   urlLink  How Old is Your Inner Child?    brought to you by  urlLink

       urlLink    Today I'm really really sad. Since Wednesday, my older brother and my dad have been at each others necks...yesterday was the last straw. Billy left in the middle of the night, last night! My mom woke me up early this morning to tell me. She is so upset; she's trying to hold it all in but I know for a fact she just wants to break down and cry. (because even though he can really piss me off at times, tears are streaming down my face.) I don't know where he is...Last night wasn't a good night for me! I got in to a very bad arguement with a very good friend. I may have lost him as a best friend as well... I just want to stop hurting all together. I need to some how put an end to it all! urlLink

        Wow it's amazing how fast life speeds by! In a few more days Gary will be going to Missouri, this is Clayton and Mikes last year of high school, in a year and 5 months I will be joining the army, and so much more is to come very quickly. I am so excited yet I am kind of scared. Excited because I will be able to meet new people and see new places but scared because old friendships will fade! It's amusing how others say, "no, we will be friends forever," and then time takes it toll &amp; we don't even realize the other one exist! I know for a fact that the career I am getting into is going to pull me away from everyone here, even away from my mom....It's life but even if I never speak to them again, I will always love them(including Gary!). Friends are going to leave and sadly so will I. It is going to be very hard to grasp that concept when the time comes but I know that the memories when have made together are always going to be stuck in the back of my noggin'! I wanted to go back to one thing though(and I know Clayton is going to get mad at me for this but oh well), Gary. I when I included Gary, I meant to say that, yes, I still do love him with all my heart. The thing is that, we broke up because of my father, not because he was a bad person nor was I (at least I hope not). We were in high school ( I still am) and we are still growing up. No one knows exactly what they want until they mature and widen their horizons a little. So yes, I can honestly say I still love him and I always will. Even if I find someone new he'll always have a place in my heart with his name on it! Just like Gaby, Mike and Clayton!           Much Lov, Brandi*

       What a blessing. JUST READ IT!  FOOTPRINTS...A New Version     Imagine you and the Lord Jesus are walking down the road together. For much of the way, the Lord's footprints go along steadily, consistently, rarely varying the pace.  But your footprints are a disorganized stream of zigzags, starts, stops, turnarounds, circles, departures, and returns.  For much of the way, it seems to go like this, but gradually your footprints come more in line with the Lord's, soon paralleling His consistently.  You and Jesus are walking as true friends! This seems perfect, but then an interesting thing happens: Your footprints that once etched the sand next to Jesus' are now walking precisely in His steps.  Inside His larger footprints are your smaller ones, you and Jesus are becoming one.  This goes on for many miles, but gradually you notice another change. The footprints inside the large footprints seem to grow larger.  Eventually they disappear altogether. There is only one set of footprints they have become one.  This goes on for a long time, but suddenly the second set of footprints is back. This time it seems even worse! Zigzags all over the place. Stops. Starts. Gashes in the sand. A variable mess of prints. You are amazed and shocked.  Your dream ends. Now you pray:  "Lord, I understand the first scene, with zigzags and fits. I was a new Christian; I was just learning. But You walked on through the storm and helped me learn to walk with You."  "That is correct."  "And when the smaller footprints were inside of Yours, I was actually learning to walk in Your steps, following You very closely."  "Very good.. You have understood everything so far."  When the smaller footprints grew and filled in Yours, I suppose that I was becoming like You in every way."  "Precisely."  "So, Lord, was there a regression or something? The footprints separated, and this time it was worse than at first."      There is a pause as the Lord answers, with a smile in His voice.  "You didn't know? It was then that we danced!"  To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven: A time to weep, a time to laugh, A time to mourn, and a time to dance.  Ecclesiastes 3:1,4.

         Oh goosh, I'm not even in school yet and the difficult decisions start. There's this one guy I haven't talked to for a long time, who I saw tonight on my way home from D.E. Well, he pulled over and asked me how I was doing and all. So he got outta the car and showed me his new system that he put in. Well, while he was doing that he asked me if I ever thought about the two of us toegether, then gave me his # and told me to call tonight. He's a good guy and all but at the moment I really don't want anyone. I am ashamed to admit this but my heart is still stuck on the last one I was with  ( kinda sad, huh?)  and I really don't like beingging in a relationship anymore! Like I said he's a good guy but I just don't want to get invovled with anyone anymore. My relationships wont last unlit I get up out of here and get my own place and that wont be for like another year and a half.... This happen like 40 minutes ago, so now I am sitting here thinking about all the crappy shit that has happened in the past.... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!....It's driving me nuts! maybe I am blowing this whole thing outta proportion.               Goosh I feel like breaking down and crying! I haven't realized just how much sucky ass crap has happened in the last month and a half! Don't get me, it's not the whole situation I just told you about that is tearing me up, it's that I haven't really stopped to grasp what the fudge is going on. Damn it sucks to be going through this!         Nigh night   ~Brandi*~

        Well I finally saw Clayton, Mike and everbody else!   urlLink          It was pretty kool. The only down fall was that I ran into Gaby! It really sucked! I think I should just stop talking to her all together. It was fun while our friendship lasted but she has changed dramaticly and truthfully I hate it! I miss the old Gaby. It feels as if she was taken over by someone else! Plus everytime I do talk to her all she talks about is Eric or she starts to mock me. It gets on my nerves when she does that. I have nothing against Eric but damn it gets old hearing about him. I could write a book about him! I hope I wasn't like that with Gary. If I was, I am about to kick myself! Then later on at 6:15 I have Drivers Ed! Ok anyways, that's what happened today and what's going to happen.          urlLink         Hopefully the guys (as in Mike, Clayton and Jesus) can all go to Six Flags   Saturday  ! My mommy said it would be ok, as long as we go  Saturday  and she can met them(with girls as well). If so I know we are going to have fun. Shoot those three together means something intresting is bound to happen!           Well I'm gonna go! Toot-a-lou!               urlLink         Much Lov, Brandi*         urlLink
