      As of yesterday's news from the mechanic I always go to, I need a new job. Well he didn't actually tell me I need a new job but by telling me that I would be better off deserting Berzerker in the Fifth Ward than trying to get a couple thousand miles more out of my truckus, I got the idea.   It is, in fact, all relative. With the amount of money I currently make and the amount of bills and other expenses I have, there's no way I can afford a car payment. Unless the payments were $75 a month. And I didn't have to pay for insurance. Or gas. That's pretty much all I can afford. So now I'm in full job finding mode. I have already sent out an application today so my time spent at work isn't a complete waste. We'll see what happens.  Now I shall write my eulogy for Berzerker. He's not dead yet but he needs to know how I feel about him  It's tough not to cry over my beloved, one and only, Berzerker. Out of the two automobiles I have owned, you have lasted the longest. A whole four years. We've been through a lot together buddy. You moved me to Colorado and back. You hit a bat in Kansas with me. You've seen five different states with me. You've slid down icy hills and stopped safely at the bottom for my sake.   I accepted and embraced you with all your scrapes and dents. I know I'm not perfect but when we met, we connected as only a man and machine could. You didn't reject me when I placed stickers on your clear windows. Nor did you get upset when I would place my discarded CD stickers on the cabs' ceiling. When GP busted your window that time you hid my keys from me, you apologized and told me to go ahead and patch you up with duct tape. Through our ups and downs, we've been there for each other. My only regret is that I never "got some" in your cab or bed. Lord only knows I tried but I failed miserably. It would've meant so much to you and we would've been closer than ever before. I apologize. I just want to sum this eulogy up by saying, you've been a wonderful friend and it will be hard to replace you. I hope Henry Ford will restore you in Truck Heaven.

      The idea of this blog is obviously not a new idea. In fact, most blogs suck a little ass but I hope this one won't. Over the years I've read an abundant of blogs and could never really find one that was interesting to read. A few months back, I did. I was so impressed by the content that I thought I should do the same at least for my sake. This site's author wrote about their life and pet peeves so well that it was difficult to stop reading. I felt like a stalker reading the archives and getting to know more about a person I will probably never meet.   The one problem I have with blogs is the amount of people sharing their stories of STDs and cretins in their lives with anyone that can stumble upon their site. At first, I was going to purchase my own domain name and keep my website out of the proverbial loop. As I thought about it, I realized that, like most things in my life, I never finish most things I start. So I think I'll use this site as a trial for myself and my hopefully loyal readers.   So be prepared to read some of the odd thoughts, theories, and stories that have been swimming in my head. And please feel free to get on my case if I don't update as much as you would like. Sometimes I need to be yelled at to get things done. Enjoy.

      I didn't think I would end up hating this song at the end of the day Wednesday. Let me share with you a bit of backstory.  When I was a kid, Midnight Oil's song "Beds are Burning" was a moderate hit. I found the singer to be quite creepy and his vocal style was odd even at that time. Around the same time, the movie "Weird Science" came out and I truly enjoyed it. Mainly because the women were always sooooo close to nudity. There will never be anything like the rare 80's movie nudity.  Anyway, there's a scene in "WS" where this biker gang interrupts the dork's party and Anthony Michael Hall represents with his glock and the gang leaves. Remember that scene? One of the bikers was this tall, thin, creepy bald guy; I thought it was the singer from Midnight Oil. Take a look to see what I mean:     Okay I know it's not an exact match-up but when you're 6, everyone that isn't your family looks alike.  Now that all this has been established, let me continue with my story.  Last week I was at work and bored off my ass. My sh*thead boss and I were watching TV and "Weird Science" came on. I mentioned to him my thoughts as a child and I guess he didn't fully appreciate a flashback from my childhood. Well f*ck him. Anyway, I became inquisitive and started Googling and found pictures to disprove my childhood theory. In addition, I downloaded their one hit song, "Beds Are Burning" and found I had enjoyed it. So I decided to put it on a cd.   At work, to pass the time, I download music on the hospital's highspeed connection and move the files to my companies laptop and burn cds. All of this is very illegal as I've downloaded a sh*tload of songs. I've burned at least 30 cds worth of music and this cd was going to be an excellent mix of good songs. The list included: Chicago, Sabbath, Meat Puppets, Blind Melon, Black Flag, and of course, "Beds Are Burning."   So on Wednesday, I walked out of my office and got into my truckus ready to hear all of these wonderful songs but mostly Black Sabbath's "War Pigs." I really do love that song. So I began my trek home and the cd started with Chicago.  Anxious to hear the rest of the best, I hit forward and landed on "Beds Are Burning" next. As I sat at a really long light I thought to myself, "godd*mn this song is long." I leaned over and hit the display button and it was on Track Four. Sh*t. I hit advance again and again until I reached Track 18 and realized that besides the sh*tty Chicago track, "Beds Are Burning" burned itself 17 times. I took the cd out and tried to squeeze it to break it but had to stop because the light finally turned green.  This story wouldn't be notable if it hadn't been for one problem. I deleted the songs I burned off of my computer at work. To try and duplicate it, I will have to sit and try to download all of those songs again. In the words of The Dude: "Ah f*ck it, man."  The sh*tty cd met it's death on Independence Day when it was placed upon a long strand of Black Cats and was officially exploded.  I hate "Beds are Burning."
