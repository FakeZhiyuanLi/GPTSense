      Well, the week has been interesting. I ended up in the ER with another bad migraine but I have two appointments this week with specialists to try and figure out what’s up. Oh but the Valium is a good thing. At least I can sleep now.  Jenna's father finally brought over the 'car' he promised her. WHAT A HUNK OF JUNK!! Good lord! It is a 1984 Dodge Charger and it looks to be on its last leg. Paul and I will not allow her to drive it yet because we are just not sure if it is safe or not! Hopefully we can get Shorty to look it over completely for us this weekend.  And to add to add insult to injury the Toyota Truck Paul drives died in Christmas when he was on the way home from his parent’s house in Titusville. (sigh) Maybe it is some sort of karma payback for making fun of the Charger. Anyway towing him home with my big truck was quite comical. The rope was too short for his comfort and he was so stressed out when we got home all we could do was laugh!!  The bright spot has been Cody’s homecoming!! We have missed him so much!! I swear he has grown two inches in these past two weeks!! His poor father said he ate him out of house and home (grin). Maybe now he’ll understand why his child support payment is 100.00!!!  Oh well, not much else to say without sounding like such a downer, so I’ll sign off for now!

      Let’s see, what going on in my life…. well, my Son Cody (13) is on an exciting cross-country road trip with his father in an 18-wheeler. The plan was to leave from Florida and head out to Texas, then to California, Washington, North Dakota, Ohio, West Virginia then back to Florida – but that’s not how things have turned out! (grin) The trucking company his father works for messed up the schedule of loads, so from Texas they were sent back to Georgia where they picked up a load headed for Pennsylvania. Who knows where they will end up after that. All that really matters is they are having FUN!! Cody is such a joy to watch grow. Always challenging me to think ‘out-side-the-box’! What a character. I have met few people in my life with a sense of humor like his!!   My Daughter Jenna (18) is getting ready for college this fall. She will be attending Rollins College, which is a private Liberal Arts College where she will be working towards a degree in Law. I am so proud of her. She is so amazingly smart and sharp witted. Law is the perfect place for this girl, arguing and winning people over to her point of view is her specialty!! And to top it all off, she is drop dead gorgeous!! Brains and beauty – what a deadly combination!! I can’t help but wonder, sometimes, how she turned our so well with the crazy life we have shared, but she has turned out wonderfully!! I love simply sitting back and watching her!!   And of course I can’t leave out the most perfect husband in existence – Paul!! What a wonderful man! I still can’t figure out what I have done in my life to deserve such a gift. Its almost like we read each other’s mind. We finish each other’s sentences and get each other’s jokes even when no words are spoken. He is amazing! I could not have asked for a better husband or father for my children. He has made such a difference in their lives. He has given them security, love and patience as if they were his own. Not to mention he has set a high standard for how a relationship should be by treating me like a queen! I can think of no greater gift for my kids!  Well work beckons, guess I better go! Bye!

      Today started off to be a good day. I went to see my PT and was told he will be able to help with the pain in my neck and shoulders. Not soon after getting to work I got a call from Wendy telling me she had Elly May put down. It was like being hit by a train. I was in shock. I couldn't even speak to her. She kept saying it was for the best, but I can't help but wonder whose 'best'? The tears won't seem to stop. It seems so wrong. Why would anyone put down an animal that has been thier best friend for nine years?   Wendy kept saying she couldn't take care of Elli, that she was having seasures and was sure something was wrong with her -BUT SHE NEVER TOOK HER TO THE VET TO BE SURE. She just up and had her put to sleep. Bear begged her to give him one day to try and find a home! I told her I would try to keep her at our house while Paul looked for a home. Hell, Brett even said he could have found her a home if he had known she was going to kill her.  I am so angry and so sad right now I don't even know what to write. All I feel is pain. That sweet dog did NOT deserve to be destroyed. And what was her crime? Loving Wendy too much? Good lord this is just sick! Why? Why? Why? I just don't understand..........this is sooooo wrong.........
