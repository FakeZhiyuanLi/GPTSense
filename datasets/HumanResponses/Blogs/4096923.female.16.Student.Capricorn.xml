      Last Aug. 1, 2004 I've been in the UPDILIMAN to watched the play together with my classmates. The title of the play is Tatarin one of the most popular written works of Nick Joaquin. The 1st 2 scene is kinda boring but as the plays goes on, its all good... and in that day I've known Lex Marcos and we became friends. The crowd is shouting and they are all enjoy the play. Its so nice to be there...

      I  end up my senior year in St. Matthew College last March 28, 2004. This is a big year for me because at last I will be graduated in highschool... but there are numerous questions floating in my mind. A question that need to be answer and that is college life. During my stayed in senior year I always ask questions to those of my friends if what is the best course? they said nursing, engineering and etc.. I took up 5 entrance examination in different universities. The 1st university is UPDILIMAn which i dont expect to passed because only those genious can passed in that school. Luckily im not ;) next is UST which is my dream school but it has a KOTA so i also dont passed. Next is CEU which i took MasCOm and Nursing, I passed the test but im not comfortable with that school. Next is FEU which I also passed the test and last Trinity College. I end up with the course of nursing in the school of FEU, which is I really have no idea that this will be my course at the end. I want to be DJ or broadcaster but this is my life... I only started my freshmen so I really have no idea what comes next. If I will go on with this course or shift, well lets see. But I hope this will be the ryt course for me.   Goodluck to the other students!vsit my site btw  urlLink ALLPANTZ
