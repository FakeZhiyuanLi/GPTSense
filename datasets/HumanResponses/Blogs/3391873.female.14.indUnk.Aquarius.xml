      Looking back at me I see that I never really got it right I never stopped to think of you,  I’m always wrapped up in things I cannot win You are the antidote that gets me by,  something strong like a drug that gets me high  What I really meant to say Is I’m sorry for the way I am I never meant to be so cold I never meant to be so   Cold to you, I’m sorry about all the lies, maybe in a different light, You can see me stand on my own again cause now I can see You are the antidote that gets me by, something strong like a drug that gets me high  What I really meant to say Is I’m sorry for the way I am I never meant to be so cold I never meant to be so cold  Never meant to be, so cold   I never really wanted you see the screwed side of me  That  I keep locked inside of me  so deep  , it always seems to get to me I never really wanted you to go so many things you should have known  I guess for me there’s no home ; I never meant to be so cold  What I really meant to say Is I’m sorry for the way I am  I never meant to be so cold I never meant to be so cold

Lucas Faukner got me to talk black today..this was a huge breakthrough for me, considering im white and preppy as all hell... im the whitest person i know (i think) i said   Fo' Sho'   whoever the hell knows what that means.. well im going to alex's play tonite, because i promised even tho shes not in it..haha im sorry i love u alex ((shes my best friend)) i also had a VERY BAD incident happen during 3rd period which caused me to have to flee into the bathroom. hell, i missed some of 4th period espanol with the CROWTHER     i think its gay how everyone is "going out" ..most of them no it wont last thru summer     Yeah did i mention that i  like  being single?? so get off my case, ok!? jk'n      i LOVE lisa..i just had to randomly put this in here because i absolutely love her, shes always there att he right times..same with  shawn  macht, even tho i never see him..i LOVE him, hes just a pretty hot kid. :b g2g to food lion to buy some GATORADE, my life :) bye kids            jAiMeE

Then let us teach our trial patience Because it is customary cross, As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs, Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.   ..My Good Lysander, I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow." -Hermia in Shakespeare's "A midsummer night's dream"  sOo..bEiNg "iN lOVe"..is it all what its cracked up to be? i dont think so.. i mean, you go out, make out a lot, then break up while u watch him fuck some other chick..being dramatic? definitely. lol   anyway...today was pretty good, andy came over afer school and we got molested by my younger brother, michael..most of u (unfortunately) have experienced the pain...  yeah so i was lookin thru random ppls profiles on this thing, theyre all like lit. nerds who are in love with their cameras while theyre halfway up their asses. just kidding! :)  soo i love our teachers, they kick some ass..im ready for our dance too tho..  wow i        NEED to move to CALIFORNIA, im such a CA girl...NC is just too damn boring, i need the city and the beaches. amen.  soo ill check back with yall tomorrow..        ahh im listening to "tonite,tonite" by smashing pumpkins its good..lol oh and broken by seether with amy lee, it makes me cry..as does cruel intentions..as does cruel intentions!   ex oh ex oh     jAiMee
