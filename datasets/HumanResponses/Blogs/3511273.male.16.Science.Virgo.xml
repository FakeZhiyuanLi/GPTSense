      "This is for all of you out there tonight, reaching for a dream - don't ever give up! Never ever listen to anyone, when they try to discourage you, because they do that, believe me!" (Madison Square Garden, 1995)  "Forget the image, forget the ensemble, forget the rumours, forget the short skirts, the big hair, whatever! I owe this to the fans and I will never forget you so I want to accept this award on behalf of all of you. We've come a long way and I feel like I'm just getting started. Because as an artist, and most importantly as a person, I am genuinely happy to finally be free to be who I am. Thank you." - Mariah sticks it to the critics at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards.  "There is a light at the end of the tunnel...hopefully it's not a freight train!"  "Music is what I love and it's what I feel and it's in me and to know that I can do something that I enjoy and hopefully bring some enjoyment to other people through what I do is an incrediable feeling and I am just really thankful for it"  "One person could say "Hero is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write me a letter and say, 'I've considered commiting suicide every day of my life for the last ten years until I heard that song and I realized after all I can be my own hero.' And that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, ya know?" - Mariah discusses the importance of her music.  "A lot of the time they (the media) form the idea in listeners' minds. Calling me a 'pop diva' without listening to my work so when I come out with an urban song it's like, 'Pop diva goes black.' I mean, pur-lease." - Mariah from Hip Hop magazine  "Butterflies are always following me, everywhere I go."  "I'm not one of those people that goes into details of my personal life on national TV to get attention. Some things are better left unsaid"  "A lot of people are singing about how screwed up the world is, and I don't think that everybody wants to hear about that all the time."  "I'm not vain, I'm insecure."  "I decided to make my own ski-wear range after I found there were no fashion outfits for me to wear on the piste."  It's hard to be someone that people talk about and write about, you know? They don't know me.  I prayed very hard for this to happen and it happened. I don't even think about what I've achieved, I haven't focused on it and I wish I had, because I really want to enjoy it, and I don't know if I am enjoying it, because I am going through my life like a bulldozer. I still haven't marveled at it. I don't mind being compared to Whitney, there are people miles worse to be compared to, but if you really listen there's a difference.  People all of a sudden just see me and hear me having hit records and it seems to have come out of the blue. But really I have been working towards this my whole life, and this is what I say when people say I haven't paid my dues.  What I write is all from my imagination. Fact is, I haven't had time to experience all that, but that doesn't mean to say that I don't write from the heart, because I do. I put myself in other women's shoes, I can feel their pain and joy when I think about it. It's all the same, we're all women.  There's never been anything else in my life that inspired me at all. It's crazy, but I've always loved music and I've always known this was what I wanted to do. I can't remember a time when I didn't want to be a singer.

      La carrière de Mariah Carey a vraiment tout d'une légende. Depuis ses débuts en 1990, Mariah est devenue l'artiste féminine ayant vendu le plus de disques de tous les temps, avec un nombre incroyable de 15 singles numéro 1 au Billboard ainsi que deux Grammy Awards. Sur le chemin elle a récolté un nouveau numéro un chaque année de sa première décennie de règne. C'est d' ailleurs la seule artiste à avoir accompli ce fait remarquable. Avec Heartbreaker elle a même dépassé les Beatles pour le nombre de semaines passées en tête du Billboard HOT 100.  Avec une voix hors du commun de 7 octaves, Mariah a prouvé qu'elle était aussi à l'aise dans des ballades qui vous transportent que sur de la pop, incorporant souvent des rythmes dance ou hip-hop dans le mix. Peut-être encore plus important, c'est elle qui compose ses propres morceaux.  En mai 2003, Mariah a signé un contrat exclusif avec le label Island Records (chez Universal Music). Mariah a dans le même temps créé son propre label, MonarC Music. Le premier fruit de cette création est Charmbracelet, le nouvel album studio de Mariah sorti le 10 décembre 2002.  Cet album met une nouvelle fois en évidence les talents d'écriture et de co-production de la chanteuse qui s'entoure de pointures aussi prestigieuses que Jimmy Jam et Terry Lewis ou Jermaine Dupri parmi tant d'autres. Très personnel dans ses paroles, cet album illumine la voix extraordinaire de Mariah et montre toute la diversité dont elle est capable. C'est particulièrement évident sur le premier single, l'émouvante ballade Through The Rain qui est un parfait exemple de ce que Mariah fait de mieux.  Née à Long Island dans la banlieue de New York d'une mère ancienne chanteuse d'opéra et coach vocal - et nommée d'après la chanson « They Call the Wind Mariah » de la célèbre comédie musicale Paint Your Wagon de Lerner and Loewe - Mariah commence à chanter à quatre ans et à écrire ses propres chansons lorsqu'elle était encore au collège à Oldfield Middle School. Elle emménage à New York le lendemain même de sa remise de diplôme. Aiguisant ses talents d'écriture et posant sa voix pour différents artistes locaux, elle commence à attirer l'attention en signant avec Brenda K. Starr qui tend sa cassette de démo au PDG de Columbia Tommy Mottola lors d'une soirée. Dans ce qui est désormais devenu une légende, Mottola joua la démo dans sa voiture en partant de la soirée et ordonna aussitôt au chauffeur de faire demi-tour afin de rencontrer la jeune chanteuse. Peu après Mottola faisait signer à Mariah un contrat avec Columbia.  Le premier album éponyme de Mariah sorti en 1990 engendre 4 numéros 1 consécutifs "Vision of Love," "Love Takes Time," "Someday" et "I Don't Wanna Cry", et lui vaut deux Grammy awards pour meilleure nouvelle artiste et meilleure artiste féminine. Emotions, son second album sorti l'année suivante est encore un carton dont le premier titre explose en devenant son 5ème numéro 1 consécutif, suivi de "Can't Let Go" et "Make It Happen" qui atteignent tous deux le top 5. En 92 elle sort MTV Unplugged qui lui vaut encore un numéro 1 grâce à sa reprise extraordinaire de « I'll be there » des Jackson 5.  Music Box (1993) devient son plus gros succès à ce jour, avec "Dreamlover" et "Hero" atteignant encore le top de tous les classements, suivi en 1994 de Merry Christmas qui contient encore un autre succès avec "All I Want for Christmas is You.". Daydream (1995) contient le hit des clubs « Fantasy » qui entre directement numéro 1 faisant de Mariah la deuxième personne dans l 'histoire de la musique - et la première artiste féminine - à y parvenir. Le single suivant, "One Sweet Day" (enregistré avec les Boys II Men), fait encore mieux en entrant également à la première place mais en y restant durant 16 semaines, record absolu.  Butterfly (1997) révèle un goût pour le hip-hop plus affirmé que ces prédécesseurs, propulsant des titres comme "Honey" et "My All" au sommet. L' année suivante est témoin de la sortie d'une collection de tous ses titres numéros 1, le greatest hits #1's qui inclut la nouvelle chanson "When You Believe" (tirée de la bande originale du film le Prince d'Egypte), un duo avec Whitney Houston qui rassemble les deux plus grandes chanteuses de l' industrie musicale. Rainbow, avec son numéro 1 "Heartbreaker" suit en 1999.  En 2001, Mariah signe avec Virgin qui sort Glitter, la bande originale du film du même nom avec Mariah dans le rôle principal. Elle apparaît également dans les films The Bachelor (1999) et Wisegirls (2002).  Mariah a recueilli de nombreuses louanges durant sa carrière dont 2 Grammy, 8 American Music Awards, le titre d'artiste de la décennie par Billboard et celui de l'artiste du millénaire par les World Music Award pour n'en citer que quelque uns. Les accomplissements de Mariah et le succès sans précédent de sa carrière se posent en témoin de son talent et de sa créativité. Mais le plus impressionnant est lorsque l'on se rende compte que tout cela n'est que le commencement.

      Mariah Carey’s career is truly the stuff of legend. Since she began her career, Mariah has since become the best-selling female performer of all time, with an incredible 15 #1 singles and two Grammy Awards. Along the way she became the only artist to top the charts in each year of the 1990s, and, with "Heartbreaker," she pushed ahead of the Beatles as the artist with the most cumulative weeks spent atop Billboard’s Hot 100 Singles chart.  Possessing a spectacular seven-octave range, Mariah has proven that she is equally at home with sweeping ballads and pop, often incorporating elements of dance and hip-hop into the mix. Perhaps even more impressive, she composes all of her own material.  In May 2002, Mariah signed an exclusive recording contract with the Universal Music Group's Island Records. In addition, Carey has formed her own label, MonarC Music. The first release for MonarC Music will be Mariah's forthcoming studio album set for release on December 3rd, 2002.  Mariah's new album features the songstress writing and co-producing with such a-list names as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Jermaine Dupri among others. The album, which is lyrically very personal, showcases Mariah's stunning voice, prolific songwriting and incredible versatility. This is fully evident on the first single, the sweeping epic ballad, "Through The Rain" which is a perfect example of what Mariah does best.  Born in Long Island, NY, as the daughter of a former opera singer and vocal coach -- and named after the song "They Call the Wind Mariah" from the popular Lerner and Loewe musical Paint Your Wagon ­ Mariah began singing at the age of four, and was writing her own songs by the time she was attending Oldfield Middle School. She moved to New York City, the day after graduating from high school. Honing her songwriting skills and lending her vocals to several local acts, she first garnered industry attention when singing backup for Brenda K. Starr, who gave Mariah’s demo tape to Sony Music Entertainment chief Tommy Mottola at a party. As legend has it, Mottola played the demo on his ride home and ordered his driver to immediately return to the party so that he could meet the young singer. Soon afterwards, Mottola signed Mariah to a Columbia Records contract.   Mariah’s self-titled Columbia debut, released in 1990, spawned an extraordinary four #1 singles: "Vision of Love," "Love Takes Time," "Someday" and "I Don't Wanna Cry," and led to Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Vocalist. The following year’s album, Emotions, was another smash, with the title track scoring her fifth consecutive #1 single and two other titles ­ "Can’t Let Go" and "Make It Happen" ­ reaching the Top Five. Her next release, 1992’s MTV Unplugged EP, scored another #1 with her cover of the Jackson 5’s "I’ll Be There."   Music Box (1993) became her biggest seller to date, with "Dreamlover" and "Hero" again topping the charts, and was followed by 1994’s Merry Christmas, which contained another hit with "All I Want for Christmas is You." Daydream (1995) contained the club-friendly "Fantasy," which debuted at #1 ­ making Mariah the second artist in history, and the first female performer, to accomplish that feat. The follow-up single, "One Sweet Day" (recorded with Boyz II Men), followed suit and stayed at the top of the charts for a record 16 weeks.   Butterfly (1997) revealed an even greater hip-hop flavor than its predecessor, scoring hits with "Honey" and "My All." The following year witnessed the release of greatest hits collection #1’s, which included a new song, "When You Believe" (from the film The Prince of Egypt), a duet with Whitney Houston which paired the two most successful female recording artists in pop history. Rainbow, with its chart-topping tune "Heartbreaker," followed in 1999.   In 2001, Mariah signed with Virgin Records, which released Glitter, the soundtrack album to the film of the same name, with Mariah in her first lead acting role. She has also been featured in the films The Bachelor (1999) and Wisegirls (2002).   Mariah has garnered many accolades throughout her career including 2 Grammy Awards, 8 American Music Awards, Billboard's "Artist of the Decade" Award and the World Music Award for "World's Best Selling Female Artist of the Millennium" to name a few. Mariah’s many accomplishments and unprecedented career success stand as a testament to her creativity and talent. That they represent only the beginning is all the more impressive

						   According to Julius Caesar, who is the principal source of information about the Druids, there were two groups of men in Gaul that were held in honour, the Druids and the noblemen (equites). Caesar related that the Druids took charge of public and private sacrifices, and many young men went to them for instruction. They judged all public and private quarrels and decreed penalties. If anyone disobeyed their decree, he was barred from sacrifice, which was considered the gravest of punishments. One Druid was made the chief; upon his death, another was appointed. If, however, several were equal in merit, the Druids voted, although they sometimes resorted to armed violence. Once a year the Druids assembled at a sacred place in the territory of the Carnutes, which was believed to be the centre of all Gaul, and all legal disputes were there submitted to the judgment of the Druids.     Caesar also recorded that the Druids abstained from warfare and paid no tribute. Attracted by those privileges, many joined the order voluntarily or were sent by their families. They studied ancient verse, natural philosophy, astronomy, and the lore of the gods, some spending as much as 20 years in training. The Druids' principal doctrine was that the soul was immortal and passed at death from one person into another.     The Druids offered human sacrifices for those who were gravely sick or in danger of death in battle. Huge wickerwork images were filled with living men and then burned; although the Druids preferred to sacrifice criminals, they would choose innocent victims if necessary.  Caesar is the chief authority, but he may have received some of his facts from the Stoic philosopher Poseidonius, whose account is often confirmed by early medieval Irish sagas. Caesar's description of the annual assembly of the Druids and their election of an arch-Druid is also confirmed by an Irish saga.     In the early period, Druidic rites were held in clearings in the forest. Sacred buildings were used only later under Roman influence. The Druids were suppressed in Gaul by the Romans under Tiberius (reigned AD 14–37) and probably in Britain a little later. In Ireland they lost their priestly functions after the coming of Christianity and survived as poets, historians, and judges (filid, senchaidi, and brithemain). Many scholars believe that the Hindu Brahman in the East and the Celtic Druid in the West were lateral survivals of an ancient Indo-European priesthood.

						   Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me  Transcending space and time  And I was rendered still  There were no words for me to find at all  As I stood there beside myself  I could see you and no one else  Chorus  When I saw you  When I saw you  I could not breathe, I fell so deep  When I saw you  When I saw you  I'd never be, I'd never be the same  Only once in a lifetime love rushes in  Changing you with the tide  And dawn's ribbon of light  Bursts through the dark  Wakening you inside  And I thought it was all untrue  Until there all at once I knew  When I saw you  When I saw you  I could not breathe, I fell so deep  When I saw you  When I saw you  I'd never be, I'd never be the same  With no beginning and  Without an end  You are the one for me  It's evident  And your eyes told me so  Your eyes let me know...  When I saw you  When I saw you  I could not breathe, I fell so deep  When I saw you  When I saw you  I'd never be, I'd never be the same

						   Dear Miss Mariah Carey,  I can't believe I'm actually talking or I should say writing to you. You are the best singer in the universe to me. I love every single song that you have done. I bet you hear this a lot but I really think your music speaks to me. I really love to sing and a lot of people think I am good but if you said I was good, I would probably faint! I would leave your song Fantasy on my boyfriend's answering machine all the time. But just recently he called and said he liked another girl. But I know you are busy and don't need to hear about a girls break-up situation :( But it's your music that often helped me through it all and I just wanted to say Thank You.   P.S. You are the one who inspired me to sing so thank you for that too. As long as I have your music I will make it through the break-up of me and my ex-boyfriend.  Love your biggest fan J  Dear Miss Mariah Carey,  My Name is Carissa, and I am a sophomore in High School in Nebraska. I am writing you this letter in hope of a helpful response on stage fright. We just started our second semester and I am now taking a Speech class where we have been talking about stage fright for the past week.  How do you control your stage fright when you go on stage to sing in front of thousands of people? I usually get stage fright when I'm speaking in front of people and when I am singing a solo or duet. Do you have any suggestions on how I can control my stage fright? Do you still get nervous at events or has it calmed since you have been doing it for a bit now?  I chose to write you because you are my favorite music artist of all time. Your work is absolutely amazing! You have the most beautiful and amazing voice I have ever heard and I love hearing and watching you sing and perform. I always keep my ears open for when you may be performing or have an interview on TV. I am glad you are doing well and I am very sorry about your father.  Thanks for the time you took to read this letter and I hope I hear from you soon! If you have time can you please respond to my letter, it would be greatly appreciated. Again, thank you for your time.  Sincerely, C

						   Chorus: You've got me feeling emotions Deeper than I've ever dreamed of You've got me feeling emotions Higher than the heavens above I feel good I feel nice I've never felt so Satisfied I'm in love I'm alive Intoxicated Flying high It feel like a dream When you touch me tenderly I don't know if it's real But I like the way I feel Inside Chorus In the morning When I rise You are the first thing On my mind And in the middle Of the night I feel your heartbeat next to mine It feels like a dream When you love me tenderly I don't know if you're for real But I like the way I feel Inside Chorus You know the way to make me lose control When you're looking into my eyes You make me feel so High Chorus
