      Well, last night (Wed 16 June) our B team won their Blincoe cup second round, meaning we are into the semi-finals for the first time I can remember. Batting first we scored a good 138 to put them under pressure, and with yours truly taking 3-9 in the middle of the game, and with Myles Capewell 3-12 just after we put ourselves in the driving seat, and put the pressure on to win comfortably.   Tommorrow I will be 12th Man for the Island team vs. MCC. This is unexpected to say the least, and it is probably only becuase of my enthusiasm and good feilding, but there is hope for the future, I just need a regular bowl. However, it is a start, and I have been 12th man before, so there is something good to look back on.   Today we see England take on Switzerland in the Euro 2004 crucial game. England cannot afford to lose, as they will be out of the competition. As I write we have a 1 - 0 lead, so things could be worse.   Anyway, I might post another entry after the game, but that's all for now....

      Well, today we played the best side in the Island and beat them convincingly. We started off batting and scored 177 in our 20 overs, for yours truly it was a lowly return of 14 but our star was Eddie Cleator once again with 97*. St. Johns were always on the back foot after that and it showed as they put up a great fight to get to 138 all out, but they were never really in the game.   Tommorrow the B team play Valkyres in the Blincoe cup second round, a win would be great and put us in with a real chance of success this year. I hope to continue some good form with the bat lately and make a contribution, but as long as the team win I will be happy.   Not much else to say today, the rest of the day has been pretty boring to be blunt, but they can't all be great. Anyway, that's today's entry finished....Chow....

      Well England completed a series whitewash over New Zealand yesterday 3-0, what a fantastic effort, and it's good to see the old boys chipping in again. Thorpe has been the unsung hero of that series and it was nice to see him take some plaudits, Giles played a winning hand, but Englan really have to bite the bullet and drop him, he isn't a test-class spinner, and it will be worth blooding a new spinner against the Windies. It happened with Harmison, even although it took a while, but look where he is at, we can't expect a spinner to mature as quickly, but given time and guidance there should be one or two coming through, after all we have Terry Jenner's help, the man who made Warne.   Despite the cricket highs, football was an upset. After challenging the mighty French for 90 minutes we were eventually undone by the brilliance of Zidane. That free kick ranks amongst the best I have seen in an international, and it shows he performs under pressure as well. One bright spot for England was that King was the star of defence at the back despite his experience. Keep it up lads.

      Well basically here I am, I suppose I best introduce myself a bit, my name is Adam Peel and I live in the Isle of Man (UK) and at the age of 17 I am really starting to enjoy life. My main interest is cricket, although I realise that I will never become a great player; I get so much enjoyement out of the game that it doesn't matter. Other things I am likely to 'Blog' about are World Situations etc....   Well, that's it for my first blog, but keep checking it out, over time the pages will fill up.
