       Well well well.   Here we are at the end of another day, and once more, I have achieved sweet FA, other than learning certain frankly disturbing things about one or two people. Things that I care not to repeat.  In other news, my home town of Brighouse is an absolute hell hole.

       Yet another day ended, and very little to show for it.   Yes folks, today I did something! I actually took the textbooks back to school, and learned what a terrible place it is outside of term time. I vow to never go there again, I'll have the GSCE sent through the post, as I can't bear the thought of seeing my old maths teacher again.  On a lighter note, I go on holiday on Saturday, to the Lake District, which should be quite pleasant.

       Another day ended, and nothing show for it.   So then, what have I achieved today? In two words; sod all.  However, I did manage to avoid taking some textbooks back to school, and I also fixed my old keyboard, so typing won't be such a chore from now on.   As you may have noticed, this is probably the most boring blog in existence. Oh well, I'm sure I'll find more to type after my holiday.

       Oooh dearie me.   I have a habit of doing this, starting something and then forgetting about it soon after. Oh well.  Time for an update, but what to say? Well on Friday I did nothing, on Saturday I worked all day....  Sunday was a little more interesting, but not a lot. I went to a classic and vintage vehicle affair at Ackworth near Pontefract, and great fun was had by all. All being the people who weren't there. What a waste of time, not a decent army surplus stall to be had, and no hats for sale, either. Ho hum.  Today has been, shall we say, intriguing, as I have finally discovered how unsafe I am with money. Setting out to but War of the Worlds, while having £65 in your pocket can never be a good idea, as I found myself brining Uplink and Mafia home with me. Ho hum. I vow to never take more than £10 out with me again. I also discovered how hopeless I am at judging the weather. When I set off from home, it was bright, sunny, warm. In fact, I was sweating by the time I reached the bus station. However, as I approached that illusion that is Bradford, the skies began to bruise, and soon split. Before long the rain was pouring down, bouncing up four feet and coming down for a second time. However, not being one to be put off, I strode out into it, thinking it would be nothing. Oh how wrong I was. Soon I was darting from shop to shop, slipping on my arse every time I entereed one. Oh what fun.  The moral of this story is to not go to Bradford to buy WotW, when you know that you are going to buy Uplink and Mafia as well.

       16 today!   w00t! Today is my 16th birthday, which means in this crazed legal system, I am old enough to legally get lunc cancer, but not old enough to legally get liver failure. It's madness.  On a lighter note, it rained overnight, so the day is somewhat cooler.

      Having nothing to post here, I have decided to post something totally random. So:  I remember once when I was but a wee nipper, knee high to a grasshopper, I didst espy a small rectangular gibbon, and it did espy me. "Good morning" it said, and I was most shocked, as this had never happened to me before. In fact, I was so overcome with the shock that I was unable to speak to anyone for the next 5 years, and sank into a deep hole, made entirely of old cereal boxes, held together with a certain collection of duct tape.  Whether this is true or not is a matter of debate, among the greatest scientific minds in the county of Yorkshire.

       Oooh 'eck.   It would seem that I never posted last Friday before going on Holiday. Oh well. Also, I never kept log over the week I was off, so I'll have to borrow my dad's diary to remind myself of the events. I'll have that done on the morrow, so watch this space for all you could wish to know about my week in the Lake District. And if you say that you don't wish to know any of it, though.

       Hoo-rah   Went into town yesterday with mum to do some last-minute Christmas shopping. The usual stuff, but she bought me a bottle of brandy. :D We then went our separate ways, her home with the shopping, I to Halifax with the intention of buying CoD and/or presents for folk. At least the former was a success. It was only when I got home did I find out that mum didn't have her key with her, and she'd been locked out for the past hour and a half. Whoops.  Oh well, today I've done bugger all, and enjoyed every minute of it. What more could you ask of a Christmas Eve?

       Right then.   I meant to write this update last night, but things being what they were, I forgot. So, Sunday. Much easier day than Saturday, as I didn't have as many rooms to clean, and since most of them were staying another night, I didn't have to change the beds. Lovely, as this meant I'd done all but 2 before lunch. I managed to get out of work early, for once, and got a lift home off my sister. Hurrah. She had my nephew with her, and so I got help off him all day, which was another reason I was getting the job done quicker. If only it could be like that every Sunday.  Yesterday. Mum woke me up at some ungodly hour, demanding that I go into town with her, as there were things needed doing. The only thing I knew of was visiting the bank to open a new account, but that wasn't until 10:45, so I don't know where she got this idea from. Anyway, we did eventually get to the bank, and by god was it complicated. I thought it would be a simply matter of geteting a cashcard for my existing acccount, but nothing's ever that simple with the Halifax. The current account is still there, but I now have an ISA and a cashcard account. So that's 3 accounts, and I have instant access to all of them. Madness. Well, the upshot of this is that I was able to take £50 and spend it on a couple of games I've been persuaded/bullied into buying these past few weeks, Battlefield 1942 and Tachyon. Both good fun, though I've yet to get into BF properly. I also learned never to get the 570 bus into Bradford, as it takes almost an hour to get there, despite it being only about 10 miles.  Today I suppose I ought to buy some Christmas presents for people...

       Oooi vay!   Yesterday. With it being the last day of the term, it was only a half-day, but not the normal sort I'm well used to. Oh no. Rather than simply having the morning's lessons and then going home, they arranged it so that we had the normal timetable crammed into the morning, meaning all the lessons were half as long, and so utterly pointless. Tutorial, for instance, is usually only about 40 minutes anyway, and so after I'd turned up, been spoken to for about 6 moments, and gone again, I had at least an hour to wait before the buses were coming. Bollocks if I was going to wait, so I walked home. All five miles of it. It's not that bad, as it's all downhill, and I had company this time, which made the time pass a little quicker. We were passed by the bus not far from home, so there was much swearing and giving of the middle finger. So there.  Today. Hellish. Got to work at the usual time, to find more people there than I've seen before. Usually we're struggling with about 3 people trying to clean the entire hotel, but today we were struggling with at least 8. This was because the entire place's LAN had gone to cock, so we had no idea which rooms were empty. What fun.  We did get the computers back up after about an hour, which then meant we were rushing round for the rest of the day trying to get 80-odd rooms clean. Add to this a football team who weren't leaving until 1 and left the rooms in a bloody state, and you get the perfect recipe for stressed heads of department. I often feel like I'm the only one doing any work, though I know for a fact that I'm the slacker. Still, I was there until 3 helping out, while most of the "team" had buggered off as soon as they'd finished their own section. Too bloody gentlemanly for my own good. Ah well, shit happens.  Out

       Holmfirth, and Welcome to it.   A few words of advice. Never, under any circumstances, go to Holmfirth. Even if Britain was under nuclear bombardment and Holmfirth was the only safe place in the country, I'd rather suffer a firey death than go there again. This comes from today's Film Studies trip to said town to see two films, Galaxy Quest and Freddy vs Jason. I have nothing to say about them, other than meh. So there you have it, terrible town, with a terrible cinema, showing terrible films. Stay away.

       No bloody giant eagles were harmed in the making of this film.   Yes, I went to see Return of the King today, and I'm glad I did. I had no (worthwhile) lessons today, so when I arrived at the bus stop and was presented with the idea of going to see the film, I jumped at it like a shot.  "Bev, fancy coming to see Lord of the Rings?" "When?" "This morning." "Maybe, I've not seen the first two, you know." "Come on." "Alright, I'll miss maths and IT, after all." "Wey."  So there you have it. We went in to college for about 10 minutes, trying to get more people to join us, but with no success, so we set off into town and arrived promptly at the cinema for 10:30, to be let in promptly ten minutes later. The film started about 11, and I had my doubts at first about whether I'd like it or not, mainly because I didn't have much idea who anyone was, or what was going on. Still, I picked it up before too long and thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything about the film, from Treebeard's voice to the way Sam holds his beer mug, was great. I can't fault it, but then I am easily impressed. I'm now tempted to see the first two. I doubt I'd have agreed to go see it if it weren't for Nikki enthusing about LotR these past weeks, so I've him to thank for that.  Getting back to college afterwards was a bastard. We ran for the bus, knocked on the (closed) door, the driver signalled that he'd stop, then pulled off! Fucker. What made it worse was that there were a few people from college on the bus, laughing at us. So we had to get the next bus back, and made the last lesson by a hair's breadth. But never mind, the fact remains that I missed two dull and tedious lessons, and about £7, for one truly great film.  Out.

       Bollocks to titles   Well then, as with all Tuesdays, I had no lessons this morning. Previously this has meant that I go into college for 9am, then sit about doing bugger all for four hours. No today, oh no. I stayed at home until 11, then got the bus in Huddersfield. The joys of having money. Once there I proceeded to eat chips and wander about, before wending my way to the bus station. So there. Anyway, the Film Studies teacher actually believes that I'm going to do her coursework for tomorrow. Hahaha. Silly bint.  Don't have much else to say, except note my dismay that there are no longer any decent game shops in Huddersfield.   Out.

       More Photos   I've finally got the end of school photos off Martin, so here they are. 12 photos, some from the last day of school, some from the leaving party. Share and enjoy.   urlLink End of School Photos    As for today...  Not much. The Film teacher wasn't as much of a bitch, but that doesn't mean I'm any more likely to even start the coursework. There's no point yet anyway, as it won't get marked before I break up on Friday.  Oh yes, the bus ride to college this morning, that was an interesting one. We had a godawful driver who's been nicknamed "Rocket Ronnie" due to his erratic style. He's the most miserable bastard you could imagine. Never smiles, hardly speaks, shouts at people to get off, as though they didn't know this was their stop, is about 4' tall, wears glasses at least half an inch thick, and can barely see over the steering wheel. Rather than slowing down to take a corner, he'll actually accellerate and swing out into the middle of the road, turning the corner at about 40mph. Most of are convinced he used to be a rally driver. How he maintains his liscence is unknown.  Current probability of hitting Film teacher: 0.74  Current probability of writing Film coursework: 0.28  Out.

       Title Pending   Ugh. I still smell of hotel. There were meant to be two people starting today, but they never bloody turned up, the upshot of this being that the rest of us had more work to do. What fun. 14 rooms to clean, make beds, etc. The state people leave those sodding rooms in is a disgrace, you'd think if they could afford to spend £100 a night staying there, they'd be able to keep the room in some sort of presentable state. But, alas, no. Anyway, enough of that, at least I'm getting paid for it, and the food's good.  Another working day tomorrow, hopefully not as hectic. Out.

       Routine   Uneventful day, except I'm now even closer to hitting my Film teacher. Today she was dismissing any opinions that weren't her own, and claiming that 28 Days Later is a vampire film, as all the Infected are vampires. Every time anyone asks a question she simply dismisses it as "Idiotic", bitch. Maths was alright, as we spent all lessons discussing matters of philosophy and old kids' TV. Nothing like complacency, especially in the face of all the Es and Us we got in the last test. Shit happens. I had about half an hour spare at the end of the day so I went to "The Street" (sort of common area thing) where there was a guy with a guitar singing Sweet Home Alabama, which is quite a regular occurrence if truth be told. Anyway, the journey home was tedious, as the bus was too full and loud.  Current probability of hitting Film teacher: 0.82 Current probability of writing Film coursework: 0.34

       Well bugger me!   How long has it been? 3 months or more? Hell, I've a lot to write. Hmm, holiday in The Lakes... yes, well... I can't remember anything about it, so that's that one solved. Next. Rest of the summer hols, well, can't remember much about them either, save they were mainly a period of great sod-all and boredom. Oh, and tea, always the tea. Now then, I started at Huddersfield New College on September 1st, and I'm still there, amazingly enough. Lets see, Maths, Politics, Film Studies and AVCE IT, quite a mix, which reflect the fact that I've no idea what the hell I want to do. Anyway, maths isn't as bad as it could have been, as most lessons are quite a laugh, which unsettles me, as maths is, by definiition, meant to be boring and depressing. Politics is quite enjoyable as all lessons consist of arguing and Tory-bashing. There's a few people in the class who are usually stoned, as well, which makes it all the more fun, watching them giggling at their own reflections in the trophy cabinet... Film studies, well, I refuse to say much about that. Nothing positive, anyway. The teacher we had at the start of the course was bad enough, but she seems to have died or something, or is skiving. Nobody knows for sure. The woman we have to replace there doesn't have a bloody clue, she misses the point every time anybody says anything, and last week was claiming that Star Wars isn't sci-fi. GAH! I almost punched her yesterday, but was restrained. IT, boring, tedious, offensively easy, did all the work in Business GNVQ last year. 'Nuff said. As for college in general, I wouldn't say I'm enjoying it, but I am, so there. Most of my mates from school are there, and all the wankers from school went to the Sixth Form. Perfect. I've made several new friends and already have a reputation as an eccentric, just like I had at school. Super smashing great, etc.  Hmm, what else... Oh yes, I've got a new job. The one I had when I last posted I had to quit because it clashed with college, and because the boss was a cunt. So now I work for a pittance at the local Holiday Inn, cleaning rooms, making beds, hoovering, etc. You know, women's work. It's fairly tedious, but at least it's paid, so I'll at last be able to afford the games and whatnot I've been after for months. And brandy. I've been told I've to work Christmas and Boxing day, which is a bit of a bitch, but at least there's a bonus, so meh.  As for today, not much happened. College bus was a bit late, as usual, so I didn't have any time to bugger about before going to Key Skills IT (I'm exempt from the work, but I still have to turn up. grr), but at least that gave me time to type up some overdue Politics work. I couldn't find the teacher to hand it in, though... Rest of the day was pretty dull, save on the bus home I regailed everyone with the tale of my rectal abcess that caused me to miss one week of work experience last year. Fun was had by all.  *Breathes out* Signing off for now.

       The Bastards!   I got up this morning with the intention of going to Huddersfield to buy a Ukulele, from the Eagle Music Shop. Last night I had prepared all the details I'd need, address and so on. I'd even printed off a map. It was at 198, Meltham Road, Netherton, Huddersfield. Getting to Netherton was the easy part, but once I got there I found that all the numbers on Meltham Road were in the 300s, so I proceeded to walk back the way I'd come. I was a bit peeved by this.  After about half a mile I found 198. I found that it was a private house. There was no Eagle Music Shop there at all. It's just some bloody postal address. At this I was livid, as my hands were dropping off with the cold. I was too pissed off to wait for a bus, so I started to walk back to Huddersfield, buses whizzing past me every 10 minutes or so. I tired of this eventually and got on one, finding that it was the same driver who took me to Netherton. Glad he didn't recognise me.  Upon my return to town I wandered about aimlessly, put the money back in the bank, and wandered about aimlessly a bit more, before catching the bus back to college where I shouted at people. Rather than go to film studies, I decided to order the Uke over the 'Net, and that's been succesful. However, I've been outbid on the banjo on eBay, but not on the other Uke. So now I'll have 2 Ukes and no Banjo. Bloody hell.

       They say McGilligan's daughter doesn't know the taste of water.   But that's as maybe. The point is that they've got some builders in at work, messing with and/or installing some sort of Air Conditioning. This entails the entire downstairs corridor being cordoned off with plastic sheeting, and means that it's only possible to get to and from the housekeeping office by going up and over, taking twice as long. It's like the scene from ET. Good thing it's a quiet time and there are few people staying, or we'd be buggered. It'd be better be cleared up before next week. Still, the dinner was pretty good today, enourmous toad in the hole and masses of chips. Our boss kept demanding chocolate cake, and the chef finally caved in, sending through a slice of cake, with all the trimmings. I'll have to try that one of these days. If you don't ask, you don't get.  So there

       They do it on purpose.   Each morning, going to college, we have trouble fitting everyone onto the double-decker bus that gets sent. People have to sit in the luggage rack, on the stairs, and all the gangways are full of people standing. So this morning, in their infinite wisdom, they decided to send a single-decker. No ordinary single-decker, oh no. This one was shorter than the usual sort. So by the time it got to us, the 3rd to last stop, it was already full beyond the limits of legality, and I wondered what the fuck they were thinking.  "This is well arranged, isn't it?" I remarked as I stepped aboard into the mass of bodies. It got a laugh from everyone but the driver, who then proceeded to tell everyone to move further back, despite this being physically impossible due to the gangway being full right to the back, even people sitting on the ledge in the rear window. What fun. Then it dawned on me, there were another 2 stops to go yet. I mentioned this, and was greeted with much "Oh fucking hell" and "Jesus Christ".  Having nothing to hold on to, and the driver taking corners at about 40, I was thrown around considerably, and when we finally reached the next stop, I found myself pressed against a wall of flesh, almost right at the back of the vehicle. No idea how I got so far back. By a miracle, everyone managed to fit on, and we were soon on our way, at high speed, jostling about and being battered and bruised whenever there was a turn, a start, a stop or even a slight change in speed. My theory now is that, since we all somehow managed to fit, they'll be sending a single-decker more often in future.  And there was actually no point in me being in college this morning. I had a Politics exam this afternoon, so I didn't have to attend the morning's lessons, and therefore was sat about all morning with fuck all to do. I wasn't the only one in this situation, however, so after a while we walked up to the shop, where there was buying of things, and much, ahem, "winning" of things on Joe's part. Yes. How he manages it I'll never know. I never notice him pocket anything, and I'm stood next to him all the time. I ought not to be writing this, really. So, the politics exam, yes. Easy enough. I was worried this morning that I'd have forgotten a lot of stuff, and I'd find it difficult, but this wasn't the case. Yes, I had forgotten the date of the referendum on Britain's entry into the EEC, and one or two others, but I adapted and overcame. I think I've done pretty well with it.  If they send a single-decker on Tuesday, when everyone in college has to be in, for the General Studies exam, I'll punch the driver.  Out.

       Tranquility   Walked to college again this morning, with it being clear and dry. Still a bit cold, mind. Anyway, once I got onto the road above the motorway, it was such a beautifully clear day I could see for at least 10 miles to the north. Elland, Halifax, and beyond. It'd be a lovely view if it weren't for all the towns stuck in the way, and the M62 carving the countryside up. Civilisation, you know. If I walk it again next week I'll take the camera. I was quite pleased with myself once I arrived, as it'd only taken me about 80-90 minutes to walk the 5 miles, almost all uphill. Quite an enjoyable walk, as well, as although it's all along main roads, once I get onto the aforementioned road above the motorway, it's wonderfully peaceful, despite the traffic racing past below. I could sit there for hours if it weren't so farking windy.  Film studies was quite interesting, as the new teacher continued to debunk everything the last one had "taught" us, and declared his hate for the LotR films. He was also impressed by my decision to study Brazil and Withnail and I, so I rather think I'm on the right side of him. Maths, as usual, was a doss. We were meant to be doing practice papers, but as always we did them as a team effort, tehreby negating the point of it being an exam paper. Oh well.  Enough. I'll try to make my next entry a bit more structured.

       Fun.   Returned to college today to find several things. 1. The evil Film Studies teacher is not longer teaching us. 2. The teacher we had before, who knew what she was doing, is still not back. 3. We have a new teacher, from Wiltshire, who looks like a younger Micheal Winner.  He's great. He actually seems to have READ THE SYLLABUS, and so knows what the hell we're meant to be doing. It seems that everything we've been doing these past few weeks has been a waste of time, as we've all been studying the same film (28 Days Later) but the exam board doesn't allow this. Everyone has to study a film or their choice, so that they'll like it, and so will be able to write about it. In his words, "Setting a film that nobody has, what a bloody stupid idea" We learnt more in today's lesson than we did in 3 weeks with the last woman, and I might start to actually enjoy the course, now that we've been given more or less a free range of films to study. I'm thinking of looking at Brazil, and Withnail and I. We've also decided to do "Social and Political Film" for unit 2. So yes, Film studies looks like it's going to be tolerable now. Hurrah.   I also found myself drinking Jif lemon juice. Which was nice.

       Update.   I'm only doing this because I'll be stabbed if I don't.  Now then. It's been a while, because I've not had much to say. Christmas Day, Boxing day and the weekend immediately afterwards, I was working, so there's nothing of interest there. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, still little to speak of, save I've bought a new joystick and been buggered about by the bank. Also made a copy of Freespace 2 and sent it off to Chris. (Interplay, if you're reading this, tough. You won't let Volition make FS3, so I'm illegally distributing FS2. You've only brought it on yourself.) It's been insanely cold of late. The flame in the oven froze last night and we had to put it in the microwave to warm up before we could get it to light. Working again today, quite busy, which was not a good thing as I was barely concious when I got there.  I ought to say happy new year, but with the bank sodding me about, the central heating being broken, and the Inland Revenue saying we don't exist, I'd be lying.

       Closing   I'm packing this in. I can't be arsed with it, and it's not as if I have anything mind-bogglingly interesting to say, anyway.  Still, at least it's a better blog than young Ross's.

       And so it came to pass   Ahh, it's good to be back in the world of the unemployed. After months of getting up at 0700 hours on a weekend, I'm now back into the old routine of being in bed until past 10. Bliss. I've also finally bought a DVD drive, so I can't be such a luddite as some would have you believe. The main reason I bought it was for UT2004, which, in a word, pwns. I've had to deleted huge swathes of stuff to make room for it, but it was well worth it. I can see this game ruining my chances of getting good A/Ss, as I've been playing it most of the weekend, when I should've been doing politics homework. Oh well. And what's more, I've learned The Ventures'  Walk Don't Run  on the Uke, which ought to keep be occupied during UT loading screens.  Out.

       FUCKING YES!   I've found the Guinness screensaver from days of yore. I clearly rock.  In other news, a maths trip to Leeds Uni has been postponed to May because it was already full when the teacher tried to book. Handy.

       Yes, well.   As I said about spending money on pointless crap, I proved it today by buying a tin of squirty cream, a tin of pie filling, and a bottle of Tango, which I proceeded to consume at break time. However, I managed to use up all the gas in the cream before the cream was more than half gone, so I resorted to pouring the rest of the cream into the Tango. It was interesting to say the least. The pie filling was rather enjoyable, as I ate it while myself and others sat adding our own sound and commentary to whatever was on the TV at the time.  Other than that, fairly uneventful day.

       Bugger it   I'll be damned if I'm packing it in. Hell, I need something to pass the time and stop the skin rubbing off.  Anyway, muchos happenage since I last posted anything. Thus, I did get both Ukuleles, and I've learned to play quite a bit on them, mainly Red Army Choir stuff. I'm also bidding on a Balalaika, so there. Trying to use one Uke to tune another when the first one isn't entirely tuned properly is not something to be attempted on an empty stomach. I've also managed to spend money on a load of other crap, christ knows how. Suffice to say that it's starting to look like a high-class charity shop in here.  Exam results came in. What fun.  Politics - 70 - B ICT - 68 - C Maths - 62 - C General Studies - 100 - A  Now before you rush to congratulate me on that last one, allow me to explain. After asking several people about their mark, and looking over a list of marks in my form, a definite pattern emerged. Those near the beginning of the alphabet, such as myself, got high marks, those near the end got low marks, Us and such. Of course, there were a few exceptions, but on the whole, the pattern fits. Everyone's a bit puzzled by this and the college has elected to call in a sample of the papers for remark, and if they disagree with th exam board's marking, the whole lot will me re-marked. I'm sure the exam boards must draw lots each year to see who's turn it is to fuck up.  Also, I'm quitting my job down at yond place. I'm quite frankly sick of it. I start work at 9, so that should mean that I CAN START WORK AT NINE. Instead, I'm sat about scratching my arse for two hours waiting for the bastards to get out of bed, then rushing around for the rest of the day trying to get 6 hour's work done in 4. Also, the food's been really shit recently, and after the spate with the angry drunken Scousers, I've had enough. So tomorrow I'm going to hand in my notice. I'm keeping the shirt though, if only to burn it.  So yes, the drunken Scousers. Basically it was one of those days I've just described, plus the fact that I had all family rooms. That is, two beds rather than one, and in a fucking state because they've had kids in em. And I had 12 of these to do in the time it takes to do 8 normal rooms. JOY! I thought I was doing well, I had one left to do at 2:30. I go past the door and I hear voices and laughter coming from it. Puzzled, I carry on and find my supervisor, to ask her about it. She tells me that some prick on reception has allowed a coach load of Liverpool supporters to check into rooms that have not been cleared. So I go back to the room, and explain that I've come to clean it. They laugh in my face. I'm rather worried at this point as there's 2 of em, 6 foot and about 15 stone. So there I am patiently waiting them to stop ranting and start beating the shit out of me, but instead they take my side and say they'll stick up for me in the event that the blame falls on me. I'm rather taken aback by this, and just stand there in shock. After a while they calm down a bit, and then every other Scouser in the hotel comes down to check on the situation. One of them has a weak heart, see. So anyway, they get moved into the next room and I can finally get on with cleaning it. The supervisor and I were there until 3:40, but she managed to get us off the hook by telling them that she was a Liverpool season ticket holder. Still, it's not something I want to have to put up with again.  They did get beaten up in town that night, though. Hehe.  So there you have it. Expect regular updates. Maybe.

       Barbeque Almonds?   "What the fuck?" I hear you ask. I asked the same when I saw them, but I'm not one to shy away from the new and interesting. Perhaps I should be. It's clearly the worst idea ever to come out of the dodgy supermarket near college.  Other than that, precisely bugger all has happened since my last update, college-wise. I have, however, burnt myself on my case, prompting me to buy one of those Chieftec Dragon whatnots, and a shit load of fans. £50 more than I can afford, it was.  -Bev

       Ugh   You can forget what I said yesterday about it being cheaper to make our own way there. I must've spent almost £6 on bus fares today. College > Huddersfield > Leeds > Uni > Leeds > Brighouse. Hell. The four of us (Me, John, Luke and Nicola) got into Leeds about 11, and finally found the main campus of the Metropolitan Uni, only to be told that the H.E Fair we were after was on another campus, 4 miles up the road. We were, not unreasonably, pissed off. Thankfully, the bus service was very regular, and we were only waiting about 5 minutes. However, we weren't sure where to get off, so I just got off at a stop that looked vaguely right. They didn't. I didn't notice until I was already off the bus, which was now pulling off.  I eventually caught up with them, with the worrds, "Well, I was almost right". By this time it was noon, and we tried to get into the sports hall, where the thing was being held, only to be told that it was closing for lunch. This only served to add to our annoyance. However, we were then accosted by several people who'd got there with college, on the coach, so after queueing for several years for some terrible barbeque, sat on the grass and discussed matters of import. And gimps. Nobody noticed the grass was wet until about 10 minutes later, by which time it was too late. Walking around a Uni with a wet patch on one's arse is not the best of ideas. Anyway, we finally got in and wandered around amassing prospecti from almost every Uni in the country. I came away with one bagfull, which was quite enough. John and Luke had at least 4 each, so were struggling to walk. Martin and Johnny intended to come back into Leeds with us, but were accosted by a teacher, who told them that since they went there on the college coach, they'd have to go back the same way. They were less than impressed at this, so we went off and left them. Once in Leeds, I bought Halo, and we traipsed off to find a bus home. Upon finding one, I started fretting about where the hell all my money had gone. Took about an hour for the bus to get back to Brighouse, all the way being driven to distraction by the Nokia tune and shrieking children. There ought to be signs on buses saying "All young children to be kept under sedation"  As for Halo, I will  never  learn those controls.  -Bev

       Back at the mill   Well, college. No bugger else goes back until Wednesday at the earliest. Sod's law. Still, it can't all be bad, I'm back in the company of friends, well-wishers and servants. Speaking of which, Gabs leapt up and hugged me as soon as she saw me this morning, almost knocking me over. I replied with "Bloody hell, it's been quiet for two weeks". So she did it again. John hasn't said a word all day, to anyone. Nobody's sure what's wrong, and nobody dare ask. Troubling.  There's some sort of open day at Leeds Met tomorrow, it's a general Higher Education information day, apparently, and the college are charging £3 for coach fare. What they don't realise is that it's only £2.50 for a return on the train, so myself and a few others have taken the initiative and are making our own way there. If we don't find it, what the hell, we'll just wander around Leeds for a bit. Everyone's a winner.  Only today did I find out about the masses of work I had to do for politics. Buggery.  -Bev

       Well bugger me!   What should turn up at the door this afternoon but a man with a huge box. Dad took delivery, and left it in the kitchen for mum's attention. His words were "We've just got this huge parcel. It must be your mum's" I went to inspect, and found it to be an XBox! I was stunned. Nobody had ordered one. Checking the paperwork, I discovered that we'd somehow won it, over Two Way TV. We're not sure how, but hell, we're not complaining.  They could have sent some games with it, mind. We have enough CD players...

       I Am Not Safe With Money   I've said it before and I'll say it again, I should never be allowed near any sums of money above £10. I went to Halifax this morning in order to buy a new mouse, as this one is on its way out. What do I come home with? Deus Ex: Invisible War. Bloody hell.  After an underwhelming installer reminiscent of the kind of thing you'd expect to install Civ 2 with, the game itself is rather good. I mean, the storyline's pretty cheesy, as is most of the dialogue, but the environmental interaction is top-notch. Endless fun knocking tables over, and it's so much more fun to throw bins at people when they bounce off in wonderfully realistic figures. Not a patch on the first game, but well worth £20.  -Bev

       Decisive Action   Well, after the car was written off last week, we've been waiting for them to come and pick it up, which they did this afternoon. 'course, with next door having their Volvos all over the place, the lorry couldn't get anywhere near, so great fun was had. Anyway, the new vehicle is a piece of crap, and the sooner we replace it, the better. Why dad keeps trusting stuff that my brother finds is anyone's guess. Anyway, the point is that I had to stay in and wait for them all day, rather than finding a job.  However, I've decided that I'm not going to look until after the A/Ss, as I need the time to revise. Honest...  Quote of the day: Ross: You know with glossy paper, do you print on the glossy side? Me: You know with sandpaper, do you use the rough side?  -Bev

       Mmm, Easter   Lovely, two weeks of doing sod all and fretting that I'm doing too little towards my A/S's. Seems I was the only one in a good mood this morning, but it's picked up over the course of the day, so it's been fun. John's still been depressed all day though, as he has for most of the week. Whether he's just putting it on or not remains to be seen, but I'd better keep an eye out nonetheless. College itself was pretty dull, but Martin, John, Gabs, Alida and myself went into town afterwards, and much fun was had by all. Except John, who disappeared, leading us to question his current state of mind. That aside, we went to one of those cheap knocked-off goods shops, where Gabs bought everyone an Easter egg (aww), then to Oxfam where there was no Balalaika, so I'll have to kill Joe when I next see him. From there t MVC where they were playing Clash songs, so we stayed for about 20 minutes while I had trouble deciding whether to buy FMJ or Brazil. When I finally decided (on the latter) we all toddled off to Whetherspoons, where Gabs bought everyone chips. This may be her way of coping with the time of the month or something, but anyway, I told her she rocks. In any case, there was much joking and messing about between the four of us, all good fun, and we found John again when we got the bus back. Still, he was silent all the way back, and disappeared again when we got off. I just hope nothing serious is wrong.  Now to watch Brazil and eat Easter Egg.  -Out

       Exams   Well, I didn't fuck up maths as much as I thought I would. I think I've done quite well, in fact. A lot of the stuff on there was GCSE material anyway. Ownage  General Studies was where the fun lay, however. "Write a series of questions and answers as though you were interviewing your MP" "Tea? Yes please?" "Sugar? Yes" "There you go. Cheers"  The religion question. "I am too sickened to write anymore, so instead I shall ramble on about a subjuect of my choice"  Followed by a brief history of WW1 tank design.  "Explain the reasons for the changes in the number of traffic noise complaints" "People may have learned to shut the fuck up and not complain about the slightest thing" "The air may have changed in compostition, meaning sound doesn't carry as far."  Fun fun fun. I'm hoping they make a bollocks of the marking and give me 100% again. If not, meh.    -Bev

       At last   Finally got the free mobile, and not before time. It must be 6 weeks or something since I took the voucher in. It's a better model than I was meant to get, though, so it was worth the wait. Went to Huddersfield today to buy mum a birthday present, only to find the town swarming with musicians. There was a gospel choir outside the library, a jazz band outside MVC, and some pan-pipers outside Yorkshire Bank. The distance between the three groups wasn't quite large enough, though, leading to somewhat of a cacophony. The jazz band were great, though. All of them dressed in black and gold, with formidable hats. They had 6 saxophonists, 2 altos, 2 tenors and 2 sopranos. One of the soprano plays looked almost exactly like Clint Eastwood, save for being about 2 feet shorter. I could've stopped there for hours and listened to them, but they stopped and buggered off. Bastards.  -Bev

       It's happened again, hasn't it?   I've lost interest again. Past few days: Sunday - Deleted all mp3s by mistake. Spent rest of day purging HD and trying to rebuild playlist Monday - Continued rebuilding playlist Tuesday - Continued rebuilding playlist. Set off walking to college, got a quater of the way when it started raining. Thought "Fuck it" and came home Wednesday - Stayed at home to take delivery of new monitor. It arrived at 9:40, but I took the day off anyway. Today - Returned to college to find a hell of a lot more work to be done for ICT.  That is all  -Bev

       Shit, I'm due an update   Right. The new case arrived on Thursday, allowing me a day off college to accept delivery and to set it up. Took me three and a half hours to do so, with a lot of cursing and attacking things with screwdrivers. This was mainly because some tit, probably me, had managed to strip the screw heads on the hard disc, making it impossible to take the thing out with pliers and profanity.  It's also a LOT bigger than the old one, and barely fits on the desk. However, it's more than worth it, as the system temps dropped by about 30-40 degrees. However, the monitor has developed Pink Screen Syndrome, and so I've had to buy a new one off eBay. Another £50 that I couldn't afford.  It is also a requirement that you get hold of as much Donovan as you can. Not Jason Donovan, I mean the bloke who wrote Mellow Yellow.  -Bev

      So after skipping ICT this morning, I spent the rest of the day studiosly avoiding Fat Brian (my teacher), which isn't exactly hard, as he seems physically incapable of leaving his office. Having spent the time I should've been in ICT to do some Politics work (which then disappeared when I tried to open in later in the day), I and another like-minded silly bugger, Luke, went up to the shop to buy cheap knocked-off goods, as per usual. It being the season for it, I took the shop up on their offer for free cream with every punnet of strawberries, and Luke on their offer for free salsa dip with every bag of Doritos. The fact that he insisted on singing awful songs from my past (Cotton Eyed Joe, Dr Jones, Come On Eileen) all the way there and back didn't help. Upon our return, we proceeded to sit in the street and partake of these edibles. It was not long before we were beseiged by many an urchin, trying his best to steal cream and/or dip. To counter this, we decided to scare them off with a display of Human Dustbin antics. I started dipping doritos in my cream (ahem) and Luke produced some croissants from nowhere and used the salsa dip on them. Unfortunately, this had the opposite effect to what we'd hoped, and the urchins started doing the same. Defeated, I downed the rest of the cream and felt quite sick for the rest of the day. Then came Politics, in which we went and found a computer room, in order to research Robert Owen. Bollocks, I thought, and instead talked to Martin, who happened to be in there not doing his Media coursework. It was all very fine and pleasant, and a complete waste of bloody time. The moral is, don't use cream to dip doritos.  -Bev

       Yes   Not a lot has happened since my update last Tuesday. I took Wednesday off, Thursday was run-of-the-mill, and Friday was mainly occupied by my form tutor trying to convince me that I ought to go to Cambridge. She can piss off. It's Aberystwyth or Plymouth for me, dammit!  Yesterday I did exactly sod all, and was bored off my head.  Today, however, was rather more interesting. We went to the Broughton Game Show. This is not, as you may think, a game show in the same vein as Countdown, but a game show in the same vein as a vehicle rally/country fair/agricultural show thing. We went last year (or maybe the year before, damned if I can remember), and it was rather good. The usual selection of vintage cars, bikes, military vehicles, tractors, steam engines, street organs and whatnot. Plenty army surplus and otherwise camping stalls, selling a variety of fine hats that I couldn't afford, and the food was ludicrously overpriced. £3.50 for a nasty burger and a handful of weak chips. Stuck in traffic for almost an hour on the way there, and the heat didn't help, but it was worth it, if only for the Birdman Contest, in which groups of silly buggers attemped to clear the river in various bicycle hanglider craft. There was also a pipe band, who always seemed to be at the opposite end of the field to where we happened to be, probably avoiding my dad, lest he start dancing. Hell of a lot of dogs, and a few horses to fuss round, and an artist showing off his works, one of which was of Brighouse, amazingly enough. We couldn't recognise it, though, so he's probably made it up, the bastard.  All in all, a Grand Day Out.

       You want an update, eh?   Bollocks. I'll post something when I can be bothered.  Suffice to say that exams are over and I've got a letter saying Iive failed ICT, when we haven't even finished the work yet. They clearly haven't a clue.

       Now then   What've we had happening since yon last update then? To tell the truth, I forget. I've managed to lose track of time again, and am amazed that it's Thursday already.  Suffice to say that I went and got my hair cut on Monday, and it's taking some getting used to, as I keep trying to brush it aside with my hand, only to find that it's not there.  I got a passport photo soon afterwards, and it can be seen here. http://swooh.com/peon/Petrarch/TehPasschenPort.jpg  A lovely view of the scar I afforded myself when falling out of bed is also provided.  Yesterday afternoon I had my Politics exams, in which I think I did quite well, and today I have done Sod All.

       OWWW   It would appear that I fell out of bed at 3am, and didn't notice. About half an hour later I thought "This bed seems a bit hard", then noticed I was on the floor, had bruised my forehead, bitten my tongue in two places, had a pain in my stomach and had grazed my toes. There followed several hours of crawling back into bed and trying without success to get back to sleep. I may have nodded off again, but was woken up at 7 by the alarm on my phone. All this time I had an extremely dry mouth, such that my tongue felt like sandpaper.  I aren't half having fun.

       Right then   Last update was Monday, I believe, and since then I have done... sod all I think. Monday itself was quite a good day, as we went to a military/vintage vehicle rally oo-jah near Preston. It was quite leet, for the simple reason that it's the first time I've seen tracked vehicles at such a do. As usual, however, the only food available was your standard overpriced Salmonella-Wagon peddling nasty burgers, hotdogs and the like.   I took some photos, and caused great fuckup in uploading them, so be GRATEFUL! They can be found:  urlLink Here

       Well well well    &nbsp; As some of you may know, yesterday was the 17th anniversary of my birth.  All branches of the family being in somewhat dire straits financially at the moment, I didn't get a great deal, but it's enough.  So what did I get? Ground Control II - Which I got as an early present a few weeks ago £115 Box of 23 bottles of Grolsch, some of which were ordained with glass shards and a certain stickiness, a clue to the fate of the 24th bottle. &nbsp; With that cash, I have bought six games, and a Teamspeak server. Those six are as follows. Project IGI IGI 2 C&amp;C: Tiberian Sun Commandos 2 Haegemonia GTA 3. &nbsp; All for £30. Game's 3 for £20 and 3 for £10 offers rawk. &nbsp; So there you have it.

       Woo   I'll start from the beginning. Arrived at Dave's at about 7:20, so we could get the 7:40 bus, but after standing there for some time, we were told that the buses changed routes after 5, giving us about 3 minutes to get to the other end of the road, to get the other one. About 100 yards from the end, we saw it whip past. "Fuck" "Shitter"  So that left us with little choice but to walk on a few stops, and then wait for the next. A few stops. A few more. We ended up walking about half way there. On the way we happened across a pair of fine maidens, who were in the same situation, and also trying to get to Edison's. So the four os us decided to walk on the crossroads, in the hope of getting some sort of bus. The two lasses disappeared after a bit, leaving Dave and I to stand at the bus stop for about half an hour, shouting with increasing volume at passing traffic. When one finally did turn up, it was about 8:40, but we still got there for 9. What first struck me was the sheer volume, and the sight of those two lasses, who'd been there half an hour already. "How'd you get here?" "Hitched" "Bugger. Dave, why didn't we hitch?" "We haven't got tits" "Oh yeah"  The music wasn't too horrifying, but I was hard put to hear anyone, even shouting from point-blank range. I spent most of the time in hysterics, watching Dave and Martin jitterbugging or doing some strange Latino rapper dance, and my trousers must've soaked up enough booze for a batallion of Scots Guards.  As soon as Gabs noticed we'd arrived she came over and hugged me. "It's your birthday soon!" "What've you got me?" "Well what've you got ME?" "Yes, well, um..." "You can buy me a drink then." "That's very kind of you."  By careful planning and pure chance, it was so worked out that I had two drinks bought for me, but by the time it came to reciprocate, the bar had closed, which can't be bad. The upshot of this is that I only bought 2 drinks, Guinness for myself and Archers for Gabs, although she almost took the Guinness when I came back from the bar.  Suffice to say we all got somewhat merry. Someone took a photo not long before we left, so I shall have to get hold of that.  There were one or two surprises as well, notably the presence of Hannah, who I was on Work Experience with in year 11. Nice girl, but a lesbian. If only I'd known that back then...  Before we left I forced a fiver onto Gabs as a birthday present, and she almost felled me with muchos hugging. She could still be there, for all I know.   The journey home was uneventful, except for Gareth ending up paying almost all of the taxi fare.  So, out of £22, I still have £10. Hoo-rah.  -Bev

       How Handy   That going-out-and-getting-pissed-with-Gabs I mentioned? It's next Wednesday, apparently. She texted me today and ordered me to go in no uncertain terms. I'm not one to argue.  I'm also in the process of looking for a new job, as I can't keep raiding The Fund whenever I need cash.  -Bev

       Last night's events   I was phoned by Joe at about 9 to say he'd rounded up a few old friends from school, who I'd not seen since leaving, and would I like to come along for a sort of reunion. I agreed, and set off shortly after. When I met him half way up the road, it turned out to be just him and two people from school, Tom and Chris, and I have seen them within the past few weeks anyway.  Nevertheless, they were already quite high, and continued to get moreso as we walked. Eventually ending up at Matt's (Jamiroquai lookalike) house, we watched Cheech and Chong and discussed complete bollocks while eating chips. I was offered weed, but refused, as the fumes in the room were getting me loaded anyway. I was also drinking Castlemaine from a cocktail glass for some reason.  After the film, Tom, Chris and myself walked home in the rain, which only got worse as we went on. My trousers are still wet, but at least it washed off the smell of weed.  -Bev

       Wooo!   Last day of college! Waste of time going in! Only had one lesson! It consisted of being give a bag of sweets and some General Studies coursework to do. So basically I've been sitting around doing nothing for about 6 hours. I could've done all that at home, ffs.  And apparently, if this coursework isn't done over the holiday, and handed in at the re-enrolment interview in Augsust, I'm not allowed back next year. They must've twigged that nobody gives a shit about GS, and so are having to resort to such extreme measures to force people to do the work.  Anyway, the fact remains that today was the last day, and that that only about 30% of students bothered to attend. As a result I've been out of my head with boredom all day, but at least Gabs was in. She has decided that, since mine and her birthdays are very close, along with a couple of other people's, we should all go out and get pissed on hers. Of course, I agreed.  Now, 8 weeks without having to worry about work deadlines and whatnot. Not that I ever did anyway. Hmm.  -Bev

       Nine Fucking Hours   That's how long I've been on the sodding road today. Five and a half bastards to get there, just short of four to get back. Fucking traffic around Manchester is atrocious. I swear these so called "Road Improvement Works" only improve traffic by making it so much worse while the work's in progress that, when it returns to normal afterwards, they can say it's been improved, when there's really no fucking difference.  In case you don't know, this is what going to Aberystwyth Uni Open Day entails. Up at quarter-to-fucking-six this morning, and then set off at ten to seven. Setting off early to avoid the traffic DOES NOT WORK. Not when everyone else has the some bloody idea. Anyway, we were stuck on the M60 for at least an hour, due to it being down to two lanes, because they're building a new bridge or some shit. All the while dad's falling asleep at the wheel and almost getting us killed, so I have to keep him talking, or keep nudging him. We had Classic FM on, and must've heard the same news broadcast 4 times while stuck in that jam. Eventually we got out of it, and were able to move at some speed, but it was still about another 100 miles to Aber, and he's still falling asleep; three times we almost careened into a wall. So with frequent stops for rest and food, we finally got to the Uni at about 12:20. Got some tea and a bite to eat, which cost a sodding fortune, then went and had a wander round, see what the place was like. No wonder they were holding the reception in the Arts Centre, everywhere else looked like it hadn't changed since it was opened. But that's not important, what matters is that there's a wonderful view of the sea and the countryside, and it's not too far into town. We didn't get very far into town, on account of being knackered, but it seemed quite a nice place. One hell of a bookshop on the way in. Quick glance in the window and it seemed nothing other than politics books. John Locke, Marx, you name it. And so, back to the car, and back home. Going through some lovely countryside at speeds approaching 90, so we can get back at some sensible hour, only to hit the same traffic outside Manchester, this time going the other way. And then we couldn't get parked outside our own fucking house, because the knocking-shop next door has a lot of custom.  -Bev
