        On my Mind    I decided to keep the word of the day and the something amusing, but I am going to keep them at the bottom of the page. That way If you don’t want to look at It you don’t have to, I just like the stuff I find and I like to try and use the words In a real sentence Instead of the highly wordy sentences they give you from  urlLink dictionary.com  .    Crap of the day    I took Kira for her first half day at the daycare yesterday. I was there with her of course, but It Isn’t like she would have noticed anyways.  She basically took off the second I put her down on the floor and waddled around with the other babies there. She had an absolute blast. You think she even looked back at me once?? NNOOOO.. I only went thru THREE DAYS OF LABOR to let her enjoy this life of hers… lol, I’m not bitter or anything!! Actually It alleviates me to know she will be fine and have fun. She will also learn some stuff I am sure I have over looked, plus she gets to play with other kids her age. So all In all It was a good experience.  You know what really sucks about this though? Now I can’t use her being unhappy as an excuse to not go to work..hahaha!!! Well, I wasn’t going to anyways, but It was a thought for a little while * wink *. I am excited about buying a new pair of shoes for work.. I am sure that counts for something.. lol.  I received a REAL letter In the mail today!! YAY!!! I love getting mail that’s not a bill, or some random persons publishers clearing house ticket. It’s nice to sit and read a letter that was had written and on pretty stationary and with real sentiment.  Not that e-mail’s don’t have good stuff IN them, I just like the real deal once In awhile. Sort of like eating diet ice cream for months then having a bowl full of Ben & Jerry’s. I always write back too, so It Is equally fun to have your hand cramp from writing when you are used to your ergonomic keyboard, and use scented papers. Yup, I just love letters.  The power was out for a full half hour; the storms are just getting ludicrous around here. I know I have said this a million times before, but I just can’t wait till fall. On an up note, I have lots of flowers growing In my flower bed now from all the rain!!  I was shocked to see them all there, considering there wasn’t a one In there two days ago.  I like these purple-ish flowers, but I have no clue what the heck they are. They came In a variety pack and It doesn’t list the types or anything on there. They sure smell good though, like vanilla and honey… *yummy*.  There was nothing of Interest on last night, so we watched the mask of Zorro. Not a terrible movie, but choppy because It was on TBS. I really love Anthony Hopkins though, he Is so versatile. He just has that air of a great actor, don’t you think? Yes, one of my favorite movies does happen to be Silence Of The Lambs, but I don’t just see Hannibal when I look at him, so I guess that’s why I can see him as a ‘good guy’.  We also tried to get Kira to sleep last night at 8:30 that was a total no go. She was so excited from her trip to the day care that she didn’t have her afternoon nap on schedule, son she stayed up until 9:30, which Isn’t too bad either. Still, It Is 6:39 am as I type this and she Is suppose to be awake… she’s just crashed on the couch with her bottle, poor thing. Hopefully this will be as smooth a transition as possible for her, I’m thinking It will be, but the time In the morning Is really early, so here’s to hoping!!  I think today I have the whole house to clean, well more like tidy. I have two loads of laundry and the bathroom to scrub down. I am fairly sure It will all get done, but If It’s nice out we might go to the park for a bit. She looks big enough to enjoy the strap in swing so I think I will give It a whirl. She just seems so much older than other babies… like the three babies who were at the daycare yesterday were all older then her (fourteen months for two of them, sixteen months for the other one), but she could do all this stuff that they couldn’t. She can’t drink from a sippy cup yet though, and that was cool to see all of the other kids doing that, maybe It will give her the incentive to learn. Still, she Is almost walking on her own, she walks really well while holding onto the walls and furniture, and she knows who she Is. These other kids, one could walk but didn’t identify with his name, one could barely crawl, but she was cute and said ‘hi!!’ all the time, and the other one could crawl FAST but had no sense of direction and kept her head down so she crashed Into everything. They actually have a helmet for that kid, so I don’t know If that Is a serious thing. I guess It just goes to show the range of what babies are like. So back to the original point, I think I will try her on the swings, I think she Is ready.     The Silver Lining    Well, Kira liking the daycare was a really good thing, and I also got Mark to cook tonight (which FYI means he got McDonalds for us, lol)    Something Amusing To Me    Factoid:  All porcupines float in water.  You know, I would really be curious to find out how scientists came up with this one!!    Word of the Day       lapidary   \LAP-uh-dair-ee\, adjective:      1.  Of or pertaining to the art of cutting stones or engraving   on them.      2. Engraved in stone.      3.  Of  or pertaining to the refined or terse style associated  on monumental  stone.  The couple discussed the duty of dishes when the woman reminded the man that this was a LAPIDARY agreement and It was Indeed he who would have the dish soaked hands.

      On the recommendation of another person’s journal ( urlLink Nance ), I am attempting to make an appropriate ‘about me’ section. Instead of having all in the little side bar there, I decided to make an entry and just reference It In the side bar, much cleaner.  SO with that, I will start with the basics:   Name : Michelene (no last name, I don’t know you If you don’t know this, so forget that!!)   Age : 27, soon to be 28 In September   Sex : Female   Children : one daughter who Is 11 months old, will be a year In September   Marital Status : Definitely Married to my husband of five years, Mark.   Residence :  urlLink Alberta , Canada (my town is WAY to small to mention.. something like If you asked where I lived they would give you directions from Tom’s house)   Occupation : Well right now I am a stay at home mom, but that will be ending very shortly, as a matter of fact this Tuesday. Then I will be back at work,  urlLink Tim Horton ’s, where I am a supervisor.  So there are the bare bones, nice and simple. Now for the rambling.  My life Is really quite relaxed now. We (my family) don’t tend to do any really outlandish things, we like to stay home and watch movies or TV. Occasionally we will go on a small road trip Into the city and peruse the mall and visit friends or family (they are weird though and usually worth a mention In the pages!). A few of our favorite TV shows are: Big Brother, Survivor, Nip/Tuck, CSI, Gilmore Girls, Sex In the City, and Becker. We have a whole list of favorites that don’t air anymore, and I know Becker Is one of those but we have only started watching It this year so It’s new to us!!  Being a first time mom, there Is always something new to add In any post. Kira Is my joy, and she fills my days of laughter and tears!! She Is almost a year old now, and we are just starting to see the little person Inside of her. She Is definitely making her mark on those around her, and becoming a curious toddler. Right at the moment we are working on her walking skills, she can walk around things and crawl really well, but she hasn’t mastered walking on her own yet. Something I think she will get Into from daycare, seeing the other kids walking around will motivate her.  I am married, as mentioned above. Mark and I were married In August of 1999. We didn’t want to wait until the year 2000 because It was a different century… One of those oddball things about us. We generally get along really well, but like all people we have our quips. We enjoy spending time with our friends, playing D&D, and a game called Talisman.  We also love the  urlLink Outback Restaurant , and would choose  urlLink McDonalds  over any other fast food. Some of the things we don’t do together are: Play cards (Mark hates them), Read the same magazines, Dance at  clubs (though I have not gone to one since I was pregnant, and trying to find an age appropriate one Is becoming to much of a hassle), and Play computer games (He is an  urlLink AC  junky, I like to play regular not on-line games like the  urlLink Sims  or  urlLink Age of Empires ).  I have a roommate, have had this same roommate for YEARS. Longer then I have been married actually. He Is really a nice guy and has his intricacies,  and I bitch a fair amount about him. I do value his friendship though, and just get squawking about stuff around the house, which Is totally normal. Right now I guess technically we are his roommates, he bought this house last year and we pay half of everything so that It Is a co-ownership. He Is totally trustworthy though, so you don’t need to e-mail me about how doing business with friends Is trouble. Plus, he knows If he screwed me over I would just introduce him to my uncles friends, Smith & Wesson.  I have graduated high school (ten years ago now) and I have attended college. Never completed college, I had to work and was way to broke to continue. Then by the time I was able to go back I was to Involved with my personal life and just lost Interest. Now I regret not doing anything with my education, but I have no regrets on what I choose to do Instead. I choose to work my tail off, and have a fun whirlwind of a life, which I think was a needed venture for me to grow as a person. A lot has happened to me/around me In the past ten years that I have changed my whole life I’m still the same person, just happy about being me. I guess that’s all you can ask for In life really.  Now a few other miscellaneous likes and dislikes:    I like to read, but haven’t had the time In the past little while (having a baby will do that to your time).  I like to scrapbook, and have one finished for Kira’s first 6 months of life, on started from 6months to 1 year, and another of general stuff and family.  I love to type,  so keeping an on line journal fits right Into my life.  I love to dance, but not to country *shudder *, I think country Is vile and should be eradicated.  I  hate politics, but find I am gaining more Interest In It as the years go by.  I hate doing dishes, that Is the one chore I will bitch about on a daily basis, and never get tired of bitching about.  I love my family and friends, and they are all very supportive of my endeavors and me.  I generally don’t swear a whole lot, but once or twice In a post Is typical. I don’t swear at all around my baby, and obviously that means I need a release now and again. I think It’s more appropriate to type my venting In a journal rather than take It out on my daughter. I don’t find It difficult to cut out of my vocabulary, but typing It sure seems to get the point across a lot better than saying ‘darn’ or ‘friggin’. So I won’t apologize for the verbal bashing, but just a warning for those who don’t like It, It’s here, deal.  I am not all that witty, nore am I deep and profound. I just type stuff when the mood strikes me and just like to backtrack on my thoughts some times. You may find that some days I just don't make any sense at all, but trust me, In the end It will make sense to me and I will answer any questions that aren't too personal.   I think that’s about It for me, I suppose If you want to know anything else, or think I should add something to this you can e-mail me at  urlLink xmichra@hotmail.com  .

        On my Mind     My weather pixie isn't working properly. I am not sure If It Is a problem related to their site or this blogger site. As It stands, Brian had a good deal of trouble getting In to read my page yesterday, and today I had the same problems. But I think It Is the actual Pixie page, seems to be wonky.   I am also thinking of another revision for my page. I am not sure what this will entail, but I think It will work out for the better. I am considering ditching the word of the day (I like It, but I get It In my e-mail so I don't know If you all like It), and maybe the amusing section. I mean If I find something amusing I might add It later, but I don't know, I sorta think Its neat. We'll see what happens.      Something Amusing To Me     Factoid:  The color combination with the strongest visual impact is black on yellow. Next to follow black on white, yellow on black, white on black, dark blue on white, and white on dark blue.   Hmmm, well my Header Is white on dark blue, and my main text Is white on darker blue, and I find It easier to read and more pleasant than my previous page Of purple on black. But who knows, this could all just depend on the reader right?? Then again, I always see a bumblebee and hardly ever see mosquito's coming.     Crap of the day     Only four more days of freedom left. This sucks so bad I have no words. I am hoping for a long shot here and maybe a winning lottery number. * Sigh * I suppose It will all be okay In the end. Right now our main concern Is all the driving and scheduling to make sure Kira and I are able to get home. Mark works ungodly hours (have I mentioned that?? lol) and I have no license yet, so we have to try and make a game plan to go by. As It stands we are okay In the morning leaving at 6:30 to drop Kira off at daycare, get me to work by 7 and he goes to work after me. BUT coming home Is a bit tough. I think next week might be a okay because I will go to curves after work all four days, but usually I only go three times a week, and that Is all you are suppose to go, but I missed once this week.&nbsp; But after that, I don't know If It will all be good. Mark figures he will end up doing his bin work and paperwork after twoish because that is usually when he gets done his calls in town. Then he will have to do other work until I get off of work to get Kira and drive us home. This Is just such a drag, I actually can't wait to have my own license now.   I don't know If you all know about my Better Business Bureau claim, but I just got a letter In the mail about It and apparently for them to get my money back and file a complete claim, they have to be able to contact the business I am complaining about. Obviously, right? Well the damn business doesn't have a legitimate fucking address or phone number!!! I am so pissed off, now I have to try and track all this shit down and I am having a lot of problems with It. SOOO, in the efforts that maybe you guys can help this Is all the Info: The company name is Clerical Gear (clericalgear.com DON'T go there, just telling you), the owners of the business are Judy & Troy Ellis and as far as I know they had there businesses set up In Boston, and Newtown PA. This Is all I have. I have tried getting the address and whatnot from them, but like they are going to give It to me so I can file a complaint about them. Anyways, just to reiterate, everything on-line work related Is a total, utter, complete SCAM and no one at any time should EVER give them any amount of time or money!! * ahem * that being said, happy surfing.   I have a huge mess In the kitchen to clean today. I made muffins and cookies and two dinners, and haven't cleaned up at all!! I know, that is so bad, but hey, I just wanted to eat not clean!! Mark was a good boy today and did most of the dishes and loaded the dishwasher, so all I have left Is the cookie sheets, pre-soaked muffin tin and a bowl, plus just wiping counters and sweep/mop the floor. So actually It Isn't a HUGE mess anymore, but a mess that I am avoiding anyways. I also should at some point get up stairs and sweep/mop the floors up there. We have laminate up there and I&nbsp; always forget to quickly bring up the mop and do a quick swipe. So the upstairs doesn't get much love from the mop, which Isn't to bad because It Is laminate and shouldn't be wet, and we only go up to sleep so It's not In a high traffic area. Still though, need to remember It.   Talking with  urlLink Kaye  on messenger&nbsp;today she pointed out that I capitalize all my "I's" . I had no Idea that I did this, so I looked back at all my posts, and sure enough I do!! It's like a sickness! You don't have to capitalize them all, I just do. Somewhere I must have picked up this notion that you HAD to, and so I just got Into the habit of doing It. &nbsp;But now I am OVERLY conscience of this, and capitalizing even though I know I don't have to, and I am going crazy!! So, I have decided that I just don't care, and I like my capital "I's". SO there!! TTHHHPPPTTT!!!   Mark and I were talking about projects that still need to be done to fix up this house, and we were talking about not painting until the winter and instead putting up a new fence. The one we have now was make shifted from materials from our old deck, so It Is an eye sore. Plus we hate our neighbors and their fucking dandelion infested lawn, so It would be nice to have a big tall fence to separate. I agree with all this totally, but given that there Is only what, four more weeks of summer (well not really but you get It) we don't have that much time. Plus with the new daycare expense we are set back just a tad for the initial down payment (first and last months fees) . We aren't broke, but I don't think we have the cash for a fence, It's a little expensive and we still need gas for the truck and food for our bellies. I haven't a clue, we will do what ever.   Evil MS Office.. It has slyly changed the annoying paperclip to a cute little doggy, I'm on to you Gates...!!!!     The Silver Lining     I know this might sound so 50's, but I made cookies and they turned out perfect! The nice consistency of chips to batter and smooshy center to crunchy bottoms!! Oh, I made chocolate chip cookies after the disastrous peanut butter cookie fiasco (which I haven't mentioned, I just burnt half the mix is all).     Word of the Day       ensorcell or ensorcel   \en-SOR-suhl\, transitive verb:&nbsp;&nbsp;  To enchant; to bewitch.&nbsp;   All of a sudden Mark was clucking like a chicken! The lady had him hypnotized, though he says she must have rolled a natural twenty to ENSORCELL him with a charm spell.     Bonus Setion        &nbsp;  I have been playing around with the HTML coding and now I have figured out these nifty symbols and stuff! So of course you will all be subjected to seeing them In more of my posts... bwwaahhhaaa!!!  Ψ&nbsp;&nbsp; Ω&nbsp;&nbsp; Φ      &nbsp;   IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED BIG BROTHER, DO NOT READ THIS!!! SPOILER!!!&nbsp;   Okay, now that being said OH MY GOD!!! You know what, I was really hoping Adria would make It this week and thank the gods she did, but If I would have realized that Holly was going to end up talking for that LONG afterwards, I would have just walked away!!!! She Is SOOO annoying! If I were any of the house guests I would have evicted her a LLOOONNGGG time ago!!!!&nbsp;   IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED NIP/TUCK, DO NOT READ THIS!! SPOILER!!&nbsp;   Could that kid Matt look anymore like Michael Jackson??&nbsp; Seriously sickening, he has the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the fake white look (hehe)&nbsp; everything but the eyebrows, I have no Idea which parent contributed to those bushy bad boys, but thank the gods because that Is probably the only thing they can Identify with!! Ugly guy that one, and what the hell is with Christians hair? Way to short and not playful at all. He Is still totally hot though * wink * . Can you believe this turn around though?? The whole thing with that chick who plays Jean Grey on X-men Is just sicko. And the whole sperm donation from Christian to Liz, WOW, talk about your monumental disasters!!

        On my Mind     I made muffins from this instant just add water mix, and I am trying to figure out why they are so darn small!! They look like little buttons where muffins should be!!     Something Amusing To Me     Ice is a food and like any food, it can go "bad." Every food code in the U.S. and Canada defines ice as food. We eat more ice than we do bread, nearly a hundred million tons a year or about two pounds per person per day.   Oh, believe you me, this is totally true! I have had ice in the freezer, and had it come out tasting like … well… freezer!! Especially awful when you want to make a daiquiri!!     Crap of the day     Okay, I am going to let you In on a little secret. I actually type my posts a little bit at a time. I usually start off in the morning posting a complete post, and then taking my crafty “Blog Template” that I made In MS Office “©” and start a new one. From there I usually get the word of the day and the amusing sections done. Then I do what ever I do In the day, and when ever something strikes me as something to squawk about, I type It down. I know, It’s sorta like cheating… but I have no time to just sit and type all this stuff all In one shot!! Anyways, so you know, most of my posts end up speaking about the previous daily events because of this. Just FYI.   Kira got up at 6 am today (yesterday, bwwaahhhaaa) and was really pissy. I think she realized that we have now tampered with her sleeping until 9 am, and she Is just plain mad. I was too when I was little and my mommy used to kick my but out of bed, then realize I was actually awake long before then anyways.&nbsp; I digress, so Kira wakes up and Is screeching her lungs out, a first time thing for all of us to experience. You know what Mark does? He nudges me on the shoulder and says “ you gonna get that?”!!!! I almost died. Of course I was going to go see to her, but STILL. So I went and got her out of her crib, brought her to bed (which I never do), and plunked her down by her father. He looked at me all horrified, and I just calmly said “Good morning hun, I am going to go make her a bottle and go pee, your turn!” Well, that was one of the funniest moments in my life!! He realized that he was being an ass and apologized to me after I got out of the bathroom. He also changed her diaper and calmed her down, so It’s all good… but I sure had a laugh at his expense this morning!   The dog Is really beginning to just Irritate the living shit out of me. Seriously. That dog has to like, go get a job or something!! She Is normally really good around Kira, and around the rules of the house with begging and where to be during diner and all that jazz. But lately she has taken It upon herself to REVISE the rules to her liking. I can tell you she is this close to death. She doesn’t do this to me (because she knows I would kill her), but she waits for Mark to come home and eat diner and BEGS. She sits there, all pathetic In full out begging mode. Mark could care less, he Is so hungry by the time he gets home, but me on the other hand. I get so mad at her, and yell at her to get the “hell down the hallway now or you will be my next pair of mukluks!!” I think she might turn Into a fashion don’t, she had better be careful.   Well Mark did me a huge favor last night, he installed MS Office on my computer (yay!), but In doing so It made my Sims just vanish off my desktop. I haven’t the slightest Idea why that happened, all I know Is I have to start from scratch now.. and I think I am happy about this! At first I was REALLY pissed off, and 10 kinds of nasty… but I re-installed It and It Is so fresh! So new!&nbsp; I started playing It again today and ENJOYED It!! I haven’t had this basic a game In months, so I am happy now. Well, happy as one can get..lol.   I wanted the office program so that I can keep count of how many words I type, but I must have It all set up wrong or something. I just have this bar that tells me how many words are In each paragraph. So I am going to have to fix that. It also adds spaces, and I don’t think you should get credit for pressing the space bar, unless you are habitually running words together, In that case you deserve a fucking metal!! You know what I could REALLY do without? That damn paper clip. That thing Is really getting on my nerves. Really really.&nbsp; I do like the instant spell checker thingy and the grammar thingy.&nbsp; That helps me lots, because… you know, I have no writing skills at all and still managed to graduate from high school and go to college. * grins * &nbsp;Oh wait.. I just figured It all out!! It’s a separate thing you have to look for .. eish, like talk about work!!!     The Silver Lining     I am happy with my Sim’s game… and I am making spaghetti for supper.&nbsp; That’s about all I got today.     Word of the Day       aerie or eyrie   &nbsp;&nbsp; \EYE-ree\, noun:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;   1.&nbsp; The bird's nest built on a lofty place, such as a cliff or&nbsp;&nbsp; mountaintop.&nbsp;  2. A dwelling or stronghold located in a lofty place.   Mercedes Lackey always has great books involving Gryphons. Gryphons are typically found dwelling In AERIES.

        On my Mind     I found out that there are 3 series of books I haven't read of R.A.Salvatore's... so now I am also on the book hunt. I don't order from book clubs or anything, so I will have to go to my local chapters and bitch them out until they either A.) get the books or B.) order them for me special. I don't know how well this will work.. But I have just gotten my paypal account to work from my bank.. So maybe I will try out Amazon or something. If any of you have any suggestions for a good deal on books I would love to know. Hmm.. I will check out e-bay, sometimes they have odd-ball books. Ya...     Something Amusing To Me      Seedless oranges were not grown in the United States until 1871. The first ones came from Brazil and were planted in California.    Now, I am no expert or anything, but don't you think It Is a little HAZARDOUS to try and weed out seeds?? Like how do you get these things to grow afterwards?? They are already having a terrible time with the bananas.... silly scientists....     Crap of the day     Okay now, I am a little miffed at something here, so I will have to share.. Or I will burst. I have a pet peeve BEYOND petpeeves... You know what I really really really hate?? On fucking T.V. reality programs before they vote someone off, or put them on the block, or whatever they do to these other contestants... The person doing it ALWAYS says "It's nothing personal". I HATE THAT!!! It's ALWAYS personal!!! Otherwise they wouldn't be doing it!!! This line always has bothered me... It's like trying to make nice when you are being an ass. Just had to clear that up.   I woke up at 6:30 yesterday morning In the attempts of regaining a schedule, and Kira was SO impressed by that I tell you. By 8 am she was ready for a nap again!! I kept her awake though, so of course she was unruly and nasty. My bad. But this should help her schedule too, so It's all good. Being the president and member of C-BAN (coalition for babies against naps) she has found her way back into napping.. You know cuz 6 am is to early for life.   I also talked to my boss at work, and I will be going Into my work as a supervisor again. This sorta sucks, because I know NOTHING... Everything changed while I was gone. Well the tills and the bake system and the pricing. I guess stuff I can just learn, so It's not so bad. BUT, I just don't want people to be all catty because I wear a supervisors uniform and can't answer their questions. *Sigh*.. Well I know how to direct people to others, so I guess I will just have to do that for now. These are a whole new group of people though, so I will have to try and gain their respect before trying to tell them what to do... I just hope It all works out smoothly. I went to get my uniforms and such.. I was there for al of about half an hour and I already have that coffee smog stench all over me! I really didn't miss that AT ALL. I would have a shower in the morning, then again once I got home after work.. Not so bad that we have an all inclusive water bill now, but still very time consuming, even though being clean is a good reward!   I am goint to switch Kira's bath schedule over today as well. We are going to have a bath at night instead of in the day... So that she is use to bath/bottle/bed. Hopefully this will work *fingers crossed*. On another note, I bought these soft cookies (grocery shopping, gotta love the 'extras') they are called Dare bearpaws, and they come in three different flavors. I bought the apple ones, and I love them! Of course they are for Kira *cough*, but I had to test them... lol!!! They are good though, and come in packets of two (6 per box, 12 cookies total). I just think they are tasty. I got suckered into making Mark peanut butter cookies. I hate making those damn things... Not only do you have to use your hands in the mix to make sure everything is the right consistency of "goo". But you have to refridgerate them for two hours (so the dough hardens), by the time I have the time to make the darned things I am usually not easily readied&nbsp;2 hours later!! So sometimes the cookies get made the next day, which is alright, nothing bad will happen to the dough, but I end up wanting a fricking cookie SO BAD by that time I eat at least half a dozen before the guilt sets In. They are really yummy though.     The Silver Lining     well, I think that even though I have to go back to work, It Is nice to know that It Is all settled and I know what I am walking Into. I have been gone over a year, so a lot of new faces and procedures. Nice to know where I stand before the 'fit hits the shan'...lol!!     Word of the Day       roborant   \ROB-uh-ruhnt\, adjective:  1. Strengthening; restoring vigor.  2. A strengthening medicine; a tonic; a restorative.   The ranger stood there in silence as he pondered what his next move should be. He decided that If he were to take on the frost giant he would be in need of a ROBORANT, and so decided to find the rest of his party, saving the slaughter of the beast for another day.

        On my Mind     Trying to get my notify list running the way I want It... New thing over to the left there.     Something Amusing To Me     There are 62,000 miles of arteries, capillaries, and veins in the adult human body.  I definitely have to remember that for the next person who pisses me off.. Then I can tell them just how many miles I will yank out of them!!     Crap of the day     I have to take everything off the walls, wash them, sand them, prime them then paint them. This is what I have decided. I am sick and tired of this damn taupe color.. It's bringin' me down!!! It just looks like you are in a mud hut or something, It sucks all the light out of the room, and It Is hard enough with the trees out front sucking up the majority of the light already. So this is my "plan" for the week. I only really have a little time left before work starts.. So I need to get a move on It. Figures that I would choose a large project to do once I have already cleaned the heck out of the house eh? HAHAHA... Oh well, I just need more brightness. Maybe I will go blue.. Maybe green.. I don't know. I will have to look at some swatches and make a decision. All I know Is that It needs to be a really light color so that It doesn't make It any darker In here.   Watched Shreck for the first time in like a year, Kira of course was madly in love with It.. She's just weird. But there Is a line In the movie that I have sort of really wondered about.. Now this Is going to be a really stupid ponder, so brace your selves for loss of intelligence. Okay? Okay. Well he says after burping "better out than In I always say", and when ever you ask people they tell you that It means better to burp then to fart. I just don't get that. Farting is out too.. So what the hell does It mean??? Hey, I warned you!! You can feel free to e-mail your response to  urlLink Iamanidiot.com .&nbsp;   &nbsp; I heard from my mother in law that there is yet another bout of the my doom virus floating around out there. So just a warning out there to you all.. I know you are careful with your e-mails and such, but her bank got the virus from someone opening a file that she thought was froma friend.. and so it works from your address book to infect. I did a scan on my computer and e-mail addresses and all seems well here, If you are woried you can also go to  urlLink panda active scan &nbsp; and get your own computer done. I am Indebted to Brian for this link, makes me feel better knowing instead of guessing what is on my computer.

        On my Mind     Just wondering what I should be doing today, I cleaned up so well yesterday I have bleach marks on my hands... That can't be good...     Something Amusing To Me     The "you are here arrow" on a map is called the IDEO locator.  I always wondered If that thing had a specified name..lol.     Crap of the day     It was HOT here yesterday. Too hot, I hate summer, have I mentioned that before?? I know some people think I am completely nuts, but I love Fall. I love that In Alberta. There are four distinct seasons, and Fall is perfect. It Is pretty and cool and wistful... Great weather for a light sweater or pull over. That to me is perfect weather, nice enough that you don't need a coat, cool enough that your skin won't scorch under the sun. I can't wait for Fall. Banish all those tanned people back to the white and pasty bwwaahhhaaaa!!!   We were also on tornado watch yesterday *joy*. It was totally not breezy at all until about ten o'clock last night, then It was like a huge storm was passing thru. SO of course we check out  urlLink weather Canada stats , and sure enough we get this warning:    Severe thunderstorm warning    A severe storm has developed, producing one or more of the following conditions: heavy rain, damaging winds, hail of at least 20 mm in diameter or intense lightning. Severe thunderstorms may also produce tornadoes. The storms expected motion and developments will be given in the warning. If you are in the area specified, take shelter indoors.    Tornado watch    Conditions are favorable for the development of tornadoes within the areas and times specified in the watch. Be prepared to take shelter, preferably in the lower level of a sturdy building.  We just love that here... I so want to see fall...   Ken was mowing the lawn yesterday, and it is the first time in awhile that the front lawn has been cut (it doesn't grow as fast as the back yard), so inevitably there were some nature of funky weeds that I happened to be allergic to, and the windows were open. So now my eyes are all puffy and red and my nose is runny. Fabulous. I hope Kira doesn't get the same bout in allergies that I seem to have... All stupid stuff that is air bourn. Well that;s not all, but those are the most annoying. Not like you can ask mother nature to give you your air with "no pollen please". Grr. Well at least I know the summer is getting closer to ending from the blooms.   I have no ideas about what I am going to do today. I know I should go for a walk with Kira and check the mail... But we will see how hot it is today. I should also get my laundry done (well as done as laundry can get), and probably should try to clean out my fridge and go grocery shopping. The fridge Is another thing I hate doing... *people* keep putting back half drank pop that spill and never get used, and t-bone steaks that the dog is never allowed to have yet they will never eat the damn things. I just think It Is all a big waste. I have things In little containers, and I use them up... Maybe that Is the difference between growing up to appretiate your food.     The Silver Lining     Once again, no tornados!!! Also, Kira is taking steps all on her own now!! She stands really well on her own, and now she is taking one step away from stuff, then one step back (because it's scary and you can't go to far!)!! I am so proud of her!

        On my Mind     We ate Chinese again and my fortune cookie says I will be getting some new clothes... I am just trying to figure how to bamboozel Mark into this situation..lol     Something Amusing To Me     In 1976, a Los Angeles secretary named Jannene Swift officially married a 50-pound rock. The ceremony was witnessed by more than twenty people.  See, now I didn't find this 'amazing', seeing as I married a 165 pound rock in 1999. hehehe....     Crap of the day     I have been meaning to say something about the movies I have been watching, and now I have lost it completely. I know I was going to say I watched 'the Guru' on Tuesday??? Anyways, It was a really funny movie, I was shocked that I liked It.. But It was good. Just the whole premise of stupid belligerent people accepting a fake for a Guru because he looks Indian Is enough to make me laugh.   We rented "Monster" last night, and oh my gods is that ever a good movie. I can't believe it, I thought I would have these feelings of hate and disgust and contempt for this serial killer who liked the thrill of the kill. I very quickly found out that I wasn't any of those things. I was upset at the ways her life fucked her over, I was cheering her on when I saw her first kill, and I felt the most amount of pity you can ever feel when she killed her last victim. That's all I am going to say, because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but I am assuming you all knew she was a serial killer. I tell you, I had bad nightmares last night though, Mark had to actually wake me up once and calm me down. Movies do that to me, guess I have way to good an imagination or something!   In the adventure of movie rentals and snack finding, we stumbled upon what to us was a new flavor of  urlLink Ben & Jerry's . It is called 'half-baked twisted' and I am ruined now for all other flavors of ice cream (which happens when ever I find a new B&amp;J flava)!!! That is SOOOO good!! It is vanilla and chocolate Ice cream with half-baked brownie and cookie dough pieces in it...*DROOL*. I was in Ice cream heaven! We also tried the Act 2 sweet corn popcorn, and I must say I think am addicted to It. Mark didn't like It, but I did, and ate his share so It wouldn't go to waste..lol.   We are going to watch 'Along came Polly' tonight some time. It was just way to late for us last night (eleven o'clock...wwwoooo) and I just would have fallen asleep. Mark was wired after the movie though (and I think he was a little stomach sick from the amount of B&J he ate... 2 pints is NOT a normal serving!), and so he twisted and turned for like two hours which of course kept me awake too. So I guess we had the time to watch the other movie. We have this deal thingy from blockbuster, where It Is sort of like the internet movie places. We pay 25 bucks in the month (no subscription required) and we get to rent as many movies as we want with no due dates and no late fees. I thought that was cool, plus seeing as though It Is actually where we live, we don't have to wait for movies In the mail and can just go the next day!! WOO-WHO!!   I was going to address this next topic on another post.. Purely because It makes no sense to the above mentioned things, but I guess It Isn't so heavy a topic. So anyways, I was asked why I don't go out to clubs anymore and If I think I have compromised my life style for a family. Well, I was initially offended by the question, because lets face It, you can't have a baby as awesome as Kira and a husband as wonderful as Mark and find your self in disdain. BUT, after re-reading the damn e-mail a thousand times, I figured It was just a pondering rather than a bite. So I thought about It, and here It goes-   I love to dance, I love the feeling I get when 'The Beat Is Flown' plays and I close my eyes... Seeing nothing but the lights flashing opaquely through my lids. I love the beat, I love the way my body just knows how to move along in this wave of delight when I feel that back beat In a really loud speaker. I love my friends, I love to have fun and laugh and play about, not giving a second thought to what tomorrow my bring or what problems lay ahead.   No, I don't go out to clubs anymore, I haven't the time nor the ability to shirk the responsibility to my daughter. No I don't regret not going out to clubs anymore, I look around and find It sad to see people my age swarmed by 19 year olds and not think there is something wrong. I don't think I have compromised my life style one bit. I have evolved from the bar rat that I was Into a person who would rather listen to her music at home, where she can control the volume level and the song that's played. I love my life, I still listen to all manner of non-soccer mom music, and I still like to have a few beer. Only difference Is that I am doing It all for pleasure rather than sport. Well, I guess that's It.   Not that any of this has to do with me really, because I am still me, I just wonder why the hell people think I am so different. On many of the traits that make me who I am, I haven't changed a bit. Sure I am a little nicer to the Jahova's that come to my door, and I don't need to go out on a Saturday night, but was that all anyone ever saw?? I don't know If I want to know that answer... All I know Is that of the people who still know me now, I hope that wasn't all they saw In me.     The Silver Lining     My dog has become the BEST vacuum in the world!! Kira makes messes, and Ginger just comes along after her and laps it all up!! I don't need to plug her in and push either *BONUS*!!!

        On my Mind     Brian gave me the link to  urlLink this  site. It is all DnD and cartoon and super funny... well If you know stuff pertaining to DnD, otherwise..um.. nevermind :p .     Something Amusing To Me     Hazelnuts are also known as filberts because in Europe folklore they are ready for harvest on August 22nd, St. Philbert's Day.  I just wondered about this.. it was a cause of arguement one Christmas back home. Now I know!     Crap of the day     We didn't have dinner until around 8:30-9:00 last night. I was STARVING by then, but Mark had to work super late and we were with his parents, blah blah blah. I just don't have the fight left in me to demand food I guess. Kira was good, since she ate at 5..lol, but she was not at all interested in sitting down and not eating exactly what we were eating!! She is doing really well with that, she pretty well eats almost a little bit of everything I eat (except for spicy food and such). Having those 6 teeth have helped her be able to chew, so now she will eat any meat (as long as it is bite sized) and will eat any veggie. She still has issues with fruit, only eats banana's.. but hey, I have the same issues so who am I to judge??lol...   So anyways, we had gone to BP's and after dinner Kira started her bad ass cough that she normally gets. Shirley (Mark's mom) starts to flip out and tell me that Kira needs to go to the hospital right away.. and I assured her that Kira was FINE, I have had her in to see the doctor twice now about this cough of hers and he says she is fine, just some babies while teething get a build up of saliva and cough. So I tell her this and she said that she knew that from previous tellings, but that Kiras chest was all raspy. So I checked her out for myself and she seemed fine, but there was a little bit of a rattle. SOOO, I agreed to take her to the ER last night, where Mark and I waited until ONE AM (it was ten when we got there) so I had an unruly over tired baby, and an over tired husband and I could barely stand to get up I was so tired myself. To find out... that she is FINE. Seriously folks, I was so close to killing someone I could just...well... kill someone!   We were talking about me going back to work and what It will do to Kira, and I actually think It won't hurt her. Am I just wrong here? I know she will be okay, and she will get to interact with more kids... something she currently Isn't able to do. So I figure she will be alright. I might need a strong bit of adjusting...lol, but I think we will all be okay. We just need to move forward into our lives..lol.     The Silver Lining     Well, It's hard to see the lining in this sleepy haze I am In.... but I suppose that Kira's health Is fine IS the good news out of this story!!

        On my Mind     Wondering If Mark is still awake... He's operating a very large motor vehicle with lest then 5 hours sleep..Ouch.     Something Amusing To Me     Fun Fact of the Day: Lemons contain more sugar than strawberries do.   I just thought this was of particular interest to me.. Because almost all of Kira's food has lemon juice in it to keep the color from turning, and I thought the sugar count would be lower then the foods that contained fruit. This explains a lot!!     Crap of the day     YAY! I got a call back from this lady I knew in Bonnyville, I had remembered that her husband used to offer drivers training, and he still does and has a course offered for August 7th and 8th!! I am so thrilled!! I will have to do the 10 hours of drive time after the course.. But hey, no problems right??lol.. At least that worked out alright, I was beginning to think it was completely hopeless!! After the course I will sign up for my drivers test and hopefully from there I will be driving!! YAY!!! Plus It was the CHEAPEST one too!! It was only 400 bucks instead of 495, or 550!!! *whew*, one crisis averted for today!!   Well we ended up not going to Klondike Days yesterday. We did still go to Edmonton, we just went out for dinner (to the outback *yummy yum yum*!!) with my brother and his wife, then went and saw their house. It is gorgeous!!! I am so jealous!! Two and a half bathrooms!!! I would love, love, love to have my own bathroom.. Free of the nasties men procured!!! Their house was really easy to find too, which was a total shocker to me.. Everything in Sherwood Park is hard to find! They have all these weird districts, the flowers, the Glens, the trees, all these little areas that If you aren't from there you would get totally lost and confused. But actually It was much more simple then I had anticipated.. Though I kept my brother on the phone just in case!   We also went to see Rob, in a word: he is TANNED. My goodness, at lest that's one thing his landscaping job is doing for him.. Free tanning services! He moved to the corner condo in his building (like right next door actually!!) and it's awesome! He has two balconies off the living room now, so he gets a nice cool breeze all day! That is SO much better than his old place, because you would literally melt and be so stuffed up from the sweltering heat that was just trapped in his living room. It's so strange though, everything is backwards and to the side of where it all was.. So it's like you have to fight all your instincts to get to the right room!! I figure the first few times he got home a little staggered he must have had a great time with that!! He's doing good though, still nineteen..lol... He's just our all-purpose Rob still, so we love him!   The drive out lastnight was a little freaky, lots of gead ground hogs everywhere, so every fox and large hawk were on the road trying to get their hands on the free food. I don't remember foxes looking so scraggly.. I thought they were all cute and fuzzy. Mark reminded me that we are not north anymore, and the picture in my head remains the same from the plush fox tail on my parka..lol. I couldn't help but laugh.. He is probably right. OH, and IF you happen to be an animal rights activist, don't bother to bitch at me, the rest of that fox was most likely eaten by a tribe of Inuits and the furs traded, so DON"T BOTHER, because I like the fur! *ahem*, anyways, there was a lot of wildlife out last night so we were extra careful on the way home. We also realized that we are getting to "old" for this jaunt into the city for dinner thing. It is just to inconvenient for us to pack up Kira even though she is really good in the car, we can't just expect her to sit for dinner when she wants to be walking and crawling around since she just sat for two whole hours!! So that routine is getting old, and we most likely won't be doing it again. We will reserve trips to the city for a day trip rather than a limited amount of time. Other then that... Well nothing of interest happened... So I guess that's It!     The Silver Lining     We went to the Outback and had those awesome shrimp on the barbie...ummmmm... succulant shrimpies!!!!

        On my Mind     Going to Klondike Days today In Edmonton... so I have to get my house in shape and my child all packed up!! How can one little girl come with so many accessories?? hahaha     Something Amusing To Me     The word "toast," meaning a wish of good health, started in ancient Rome, where a piece of toasted bread was dropped into wine.  Those Romans always knew how to make everything theirs... Even the booze!     Crap of the day     Well, It has actually cooled off a fair bit here. Thank the gods, I was really getting sick of the melting weather. I mean, I like nice weather, but I am satisfied with a nice comfy +18 hahaha! Most people still consider that spring.. But hey, If you lived north, you know that is summer!!I am glad It was nice enough for Kira to go swimming in her little wading pool though, she is so cute crawling around in there and splashing!! Next year Mark and I discussed we would buy ourselves an above ground pool for our six year wedding anniversary. We were going to buy It this year, but where we had JUST planted the grass seed and whatnot, we just didn't think that the ground would hold up. Plus we didn't have a patio set yet, so we bought that this year for our anniversary.Sure we bought it in June, but hey, who buys patio furniture in the end of August?? hahaha   My dog is certifiable today... She is pacing back and forth, back and forth. I have no idea why.. I ask If she wants out, nothing. I ask If she wants a treat, nothing. I ask what she wants, nothing (heh heh). I'm telling you, she has gone crazy. Wonder If the pressure systems in the air are changing.. that I heard makes dogs all funny because It pops their ears. I don't know... she's just nuts. Marks turtle is being stranger than usual today too though.... hmmm, maybe I have like mercury leak or something.... I should probably look into that!! HAHA  &nbsp;  So I was surfing the web and just random journals, when I came across this page on  urlLink Borderline Personality Disorder . I almost shit a brick. Did you know what the symptoms are on this?? I will tell you ;  Individuals with BPD have several of the following symptoms:    marked mood swings with periods of intense depression, irritability, and/or anxiety lasting a few hours to a few days;  inappropriate, intense, or uncontrolled anger;  impulsiveness in spending, sex, substance use, shoplifting, reckless driving, or binge eating;  recurring suicidal threats or self-injurious behavior;  unstable, intense personal relationships with extreme, black and white views of people and experiences, sometimes alternating between "all good" idealization and "all bad" devaluation;  marked, persistent uncertainty about self-image, long term goals, friendships, and values;  chronic boredom or feelings of emptiness; and  frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, either real or imagined.  You know what I called this unknowing that it was a disease?? Teenage-hood. Yep, that and just learning to be your own person. I couldn't believe this... Seriously I was taken a back by this because I was, oh I don't know, eight out of eight for these things at one point in my life!!! Of course now all the voices in my head have merged so that I only freak out on occasion... But seriously, this stuff is all just life... Right?? I am having a bad feeling about the answer to that question...&nbsp;   &nbsp;    The Silver Lining     I get to go spend money at K-Days!!! hahaha     Word of the Day      draconian   \dray-KOHN-ee-uhn; druh-\, adjective:   1.

Then storming out of the room, into the principals office, calling my mother and the school board, getting and appointment with said school board and getting my grade change from an undeserved 60 to a deserved 90. It was an assignment to analyze a poem, one of your OWN poems..Like how could I have been vague if I knew what the hell I was talking about??Idiot.

        On my Mind     Just a quick thank-you to Lady Ozma, she has a weather pixie on her page and I stole the idea BWWAAHHAAA.. thanks!     Something Amusing To Me     Fun little fact for the day...The animal responsible for the most human deaths worldwide is the mosquito.  I can totally see this, fricking things flock and feed like mad... and they are really disease infested. Like I said in a previous post ERADICATE THE MOSQUITO!!     Crap of the day     Well yesterday had a bit of a scare. It was really stormy outside and guess what I saw in the sky? Can anyone say funnel clouds?? How about hail and lightning?? Ya.. So I tore my beautifully sleepy baby from her slumber and hauled ass downstairs to the empty basement room to hide under the fluffiest quilt I could find. Kira was really impressed *not*, and I was freaking out on the phone with Mark... who was driving on the highway watching the swirlly clouds over head. No tornados though *whew*. I hate this weather, freaks me right out. Worse off, there are a bunch of pine branches all ove rthe yard and house now from the winds blowing them off our neighbors trees. So now I have to go pick up all the sticks of allergins and hope I don't break out in hives. Joy.   We are still planning on going into Edmonton on Thursday for Klondike Days, but now we have wrangled us a whole day of festivities. We are going to go and see my brothers fancy shmancy house in Sherwood Park!! I am so excited, I get to see where the upper crust live *snort*. Just kidding Jay, I am excited though, I like to see houses even If I know I will be totally and completely jealous beyond reason!! :p Looking forward to wasting all my money on the carnie scams too.. didn't get quite ripped off enough at Colonial Days for my liking!! I always spend a little bit of cash in the pavilion that is dedicated to some country. I bought this awesome purse there two years ago.. I think it was the Philippines... at any rate, it only cost me 15 bucks and it holds EVERYTHING!! I love it. So I am looking forward to seeing if I can get a good find.  &nbsp;    The Silver Lining     Ya, not being in the path of a tornado.. I pretty sure that's a good one!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Word of the Day       &nbsp;       acrimony   \AK-ruh-moh-nee\, noun:Bitter, harsh, or biting sharpness, as of language, disposition, or manners.

        On my Mind     It's only Tuesday, and I am already having a really shitty week.     Reminds me of...     "Imagine if every Thursday your shoes exploded if you tied them the usual way. This happens to us all the time with computers, and nobody thinks of complaining." Jeff Raskin.   AS you can well imagine I was having computer troubles *shock* and stumbled upon this one. Oh, and Brian, thanks for the virus scan link, worked wonders!!!     Crap of the day     I spent the better part of yesterday morning calling around to registry offices and driver education facilities to be told essentially that I can't take my license yet without it costing a few thousand dollars or not till September. Let me explain. See, I was all gun-hoe about getting my license and yadda yadda yadda, well Mark thought It would be a good Idea to check with the insurance company If our Insurance would be jacked up to an absorbent amount of money. We were Informed that If I didn't complete a drivers education couse I wasn't even insurable with our current company... which Mark has works really hard at getting his premiums lowered for the past 6 years. Anyways, we ask If we can go through a different company, and call around only to find out that If we switched Marks rate would go up another 50 bucks a month, and I would end up paying almost 340 dollars in insurance because I don't have the drivers education course that is now required in Alberta. SOOOO, I call the driver education places in the area and find out that they don't offer courses until the high schools start up and then they wait until enough students want to take the course to fill the class. SO I have to wait until all the kiddies get their shit together ask mommy and daddy and then I can go learn how to turn on a signal light and change my own fucking oil. I was so impressed.... I almost killed someone today. I was talking to my mother-in-law though, and she has hooked me up with a number for another driving school in Bonnyville. It is out of the way, but hey, I will do it If It gives me my license.  &nbsp;  *sigh*... so in other more happy news, Kira did two things that I am totally proud of!! She is waving hello/good-bye now, and she figured out the shape blocks and putting them in the right holes!! She is a frickin genius I tell ya!! I was so proud, we have been working on these things the past two weeks and she totally gets it now. I am really happy that she did this before daycare too.. so I get to see It and be the one who taught her. She also learned something not so cute.. she bit me today. I gave her a smack on the bum (which is of course layer with diaper padding) which shocked her more than anything.. but I hope she doesn't become a biter... or I might have to resort to mean and nasty things, I have no idea what those things are, I just know It can be done!

        On my Mind     Two more weeks until I go back to work... feels like a sentence in the electric chair...  &nbsp;    Reminds me of...      urlLink http://www.aetv.com/global/listings/series_showcase.jsp?EGrpType=Series&amp;Id=11013914&amp;NetwCode=AEN    This link goes to the A&amp;E site.. I was reading in someone else's journal about this.. It is about polygamy and the roles the people take in the Mormon societies that the polygamous people take... I thought this was weird for two reasons:   a) I have never heard of morning doing something so outland-ish (and I am sure most don't practice this) and,   b) polygamy in any place is just a hastle in my head.  Back into my point... I thought It was funny because It reminded me of a conversation I had with my youngest brother when he was around 6 years old (I amm 11 years older than him, so life was interesting), this is pretty much how it went:  "Mich, what's a lesbian?"  "Well, It's two women who love each other like Mommy and Daddy do."  pause for a minute.... "I don't get it..???"  "Well what don't you get about it?'  another pause... "Well I don't get why any man would want to marry TWO women instead of one.. that sounds like trouble..."  I just about lost it with laughter... " No, no, no, that is BIGAMY!!! No, they are only with themselves, no men there, just two people"  "OHHHH.. like you and Amber?"  "Oh my god no!!!!... MOMMMMM WARREN NEEDS YOUUUUU....."   Seriously, this was one of the best examples I can show to NOT let your teenager answer life questions!! It was funny as hell though and my mom was in a whirlwind of questions after that one!  &nbsp;    Crap of the day     I spent most of the weekend with my stepfather and brother. We went to the exhibition on Saturday and got eaten alive by the hordes of mosquitoes that love my nice Caucasian blood. Baby was totally safe within her net and bug spray (on her clothes), so I t was like they came to feast on the 'new' blood and settled for me!! I hate mosquito's... they serve no purpose in this world, we should eradicate them. Really. I read somewhere that If we lost three species of bugs It wouldn't change the ecosystem one bit because of the number of other bugs that other things eat... nothing eats mosquito's exclusively (which sucks), so they should be the first to go in my book. I am trying desperately to not think every time I feel a little queasy that I have not contracted west Nile disease, and that I am just being a hypocondriac. This is not working of course, and I go around saying I have this disease even though I would SO be dead by now.   We also went for a long drive yesterday.. we were suppose to go and visit my aunt in St.Wahlburg, but she ended up getting her days crossed and was out in the afternoon. So we decided to drive to the town monuments that were around us.. In  urlLink Turtleford  we went and saw the big concrete turtle, and in  urlLink Paradise HIll  we saw the huge Ox &amp; Cart. I just like to see these things.. plus I getto take pictures of my baby next to strange objects!! I have to take her to  urlLink Vilna , they have the worlds largest mushrooms.. and they are so cute!! There are three mushrooms colorful painted, you just feel like Alice in Wonderland and think you should be seeing a pot smoking caterpillar!!! Awesome. Among some other oddity's there is  urlLink Glendon  with the worlds largest pyrogy,  urlLink Vegriville  with the worlds largest Pysanka (Ukrainian Easter egg) and  urlLink St.Paul  with their U.F.O. landing pad!!! I love these weird places.   This morning I was woken up by a HUGE thunder and lighting storm!!! It was so bright outside and so loud I was freaked... but the baby? Slept all the way through!! Weirdo. I went downstairs to check the weather warnings (paranoid much?) and luckily there were no tornado warnings for the area. I was a little skeptical because although there was lots of thunder and lightning, there was NO rain at all. Dry lightning scares me big time, especially since this one day when Mark, Ken and I lived in Edmonton off 118th Ave somewhere... we were watching this nasty storm of no rain and funnel clouds when this bolt of lightning struck on the road right infront of the apartment building!! We were thrown back from the intensity of the light and the thunder crack.. and when we (and about a hundred other people) went to look out our balcony, there was a huge crack in the pavement and smoke and scorch marks!! It was the scariest but coolest sightings I have ever seen!  &nbsp;    The Silver Lining     I have to buy another fan, so I gt to go to Wal~Mart!! Always a good thing in my books!&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Word of the Day       ineffectual   : \in-ih-FEK-choo-uhl\, adjective:  Not producing the proper effect; without effect; weak; useless; futile; unavailing.  &nbsp;  Trying to convince our mothers that we hadn't drank a drop of alcohol proved INEFFECTUAL, most likely due to the stumbling and stomach sickness vodka likes to induce.

         On my Mind     &nbsp;  We went to the fair today, and I actually saw a 'slight of hand' trick but couldn't get my brain to register it for almost half an hour... I tell you, those carnies are quick and evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;               &nbsp;     Reminds me of..      Michelene: Your writing style reflects that you like things to be neat and orderly, and that you generally follow the rules necessary to keep things clear.   hmmm.. no way!!!LOL.. Like that was a big secret huh!!   Michelene: Freud would say your strongest unconscious conflict stems from events that happened when you were a Toddler.   He would also conclude that relative to others, your personality today is moderately affected by the events of your childhood. It appears that your biggest unconscious conflict that still afflicts you stems from what Freud defined as the anal stage of development that occurred when you were between a year and a half and three years old. Freud would say that this conflict can manifest in your personality by giving you a tendency to be especially orderly or clean, or "retentive." You may also harbor a strong rebellious streak. This normally happens when parents toilet-train a child on some kind of schedule, rather than at the child's natural pace and the child naturally reacts by struggling for their autonomy and the legitimacy of their needs.  &nbsp;  Freud defined five psychosexual developmental stages that everyone goes through on their way from infancy to adolescence. And each of those stages is associated with adult personality traits. At each stage, we all had to overcome certain "conflicts" or hurdles as we learned new skills and developed relationships with others. No one gets through all five stages without having trouble with at least one of them. And it's this unresolved "trouble" that Freud encouraged people to travel back to, recognize, and overcome.   For all these tests you can get a free membership and get the gist of things here : urlLink http://web.tickle.com       Crap of the day      Well.. So the consensus seems to be that the on-line test world thinks I am neat and orderly!! Well I admit I am a bit freakish with that.. .but not totally neurotic! I swear!! Although I have been getting worse and worse In my old age.. hahaha. I found the hand writing test to be hard, It was like not close to my writing really so I just sorta said none of the above to a lot of categories. I write pretty much straight up and down, no slants and kinda big-ish. I also prefer to print than to write.. but writing is so lazy and flowey that I end up doing that instead!! I do like my signature.. Especially since I have been married. I think my name change gave me more confidence in my identity (screwy I know, but hey with a last name like Rasch - you can see it), so my signature became more ledgibile and pretty. I mean, It's not like the best in the world.. okay maybe I think it is.. but it is good now!!   When I first got married I was always conscience in &nbsp;making the effort to sign my name with Marks last name.. and it was rough, but I was diligent and it worked. However.. I overlooked on little detail that I didn't catch until someone pointed it out to me TWO years later.. when ever I was required to initial something, I was still initialing MR, not MK!!! A girl I worked with asked me If my K's just looked like R's.. but no, it was a slip up! I couldn't believe it! So I went back into things I initial all the time ( I had to initial my pay check to say I got it from Smittys, and I also used to initial bills that I had payed so Mark wouldn't pay it twice). and sure enough, there it was, MR. I laughed and was so embarrassed!! I asked Mark why he never bothered to tell me, and he just thought they were messy K's too!! SO this whole time I was making what people thought were messy K's and I had no clue!! I felt like such an idiot.. and sharing this story actually doesn't help that.. but hey, It was a story.  &nbsp;     The Silver Lining     &nbsp;  Kira watched her first&nbsp;fireworks show! She&nbsp;ended up liking the colors after the initial shock of loud cracks in the air wore off!!!  &nbsp;     Word of the Day        teetotaler   \TEE-TOH-tuh-lur\, noun:  One pledged to entire abstinence from all intoxicating drinks.

        On my Mind     My step-father and brother are coming today for a visit . I am excited to see them for longer than an hour.. but kinda feels weird because my mom won't be with them and she is sorta the glue.. ya know??   &nbsp;    Reminds me of...     "Those are my principles. If you don't like them I have others." Groucho Marx.  &nbsp;  hahaha.. just like Ken.."I can't be bought but I can be bribed"!!! Just plain funny.   &nbsp;    Crap of the day     I want to go yard sale-ing today.. but it is hard to do with no license. I was talking it over with  urlLink Kaye  last night and I decided that I would at least go for the test so i would know what to expect if i fail. Yes, I am scared of failing.. I think everyone was when they took their driving test. But I had to get over some other issues with driving too... some that were really stupid, and the other being the other people on the road are nuts, I don't trust the whole lot of you!! It just freaks me out that I will be driving then someone just wanders into my lane without a signal or anything... and I really hate that. Ken does that all the time.. just goes, never signals. I give him shit for it constantly.. but what ever,&nbsp; am not his mother. Still, I freak every time I see people being stupid, or speeding and making you feel uncomfortable for doing the speed limit and riding your back bumper ALL THE WAY INTO TOWN!! There are TWO frickin' lanes on the highway, you don't like me going the speed limit, go AROUND!! Grr... well I still should try for it, and just deal with the opposing traffic. It has become to much of an inconvenience.. and now with Kira going to daycare, and Mark work out of town 4 out of 5 days (well 6 out of 7 right now). I just can't have any more excuses.. I need to have my license. Not like I am in Edmonton and can use public transportation to my advantage. So I will make an appointment and get Mark to take me out driving every night until the test. ya..well it's a plan.   I am already getting ancy about going back to work. I still talk to a lady who works there, Robyn, and she is giving me the 'low-down' on all the stuff that is going on. And I just don't want to be a part of it.. see there are people I used to work with that are happy I am coming back because you know, I WORK while I am there, and we have fun. BUT I was a supervisor and a total bitch when it was required, so there are some people who are way less enthused about my return.. and are talking smack about me ALREADY to the newer staff. SOOO.. I am going to have fun with that. I will either a) Just continue with my normally bitchy self and if anyone crosses my path I will squish them like the insect they are.. or b) try a different approach and just lay off, I just want to go to work and come home. I could care less what they do. Seems to me that old habits die hard though.. and I really can't walk away from the chance to put someone in their place.. especially if they are all gossipy and talk smack about me. We will see.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    The Silver Lining    &nbsp;  There is this show on PBS called  urlLink hi-5  and it has these five teenagers bee-bopping around to their own music (sorta like the old micky mouse club), anyways, Kira loves this show and dances and giggles for a full half hour!! I just love It when I see her that happy!!   &nbsp;    Word of the Day    &nbsp;   pandemic &nbsp; \pan-DEM-ik\, adjective: Affecting a whole people or a number of countries; everywhere epidemic.  &nbsp;  Trying to get my order at McDonalds, the idiocy of the crew was a PANDEMIC.

        On my Mind    &nbsp;  You know what i hate the most?? When I have a really good story to tell, and I go to my keyboard, and it just vanishes from my head. I really really hate that. I was talking to Kaye on the msn messenger and I specifically didn't reply to something she said with the the beginning of said forgotten story.. and now I can't think for the life of me what the hell we were talking about in that particular moment.  Bitch about housework.. check.  Bitch about lack of time... check.  Bitch about barney... check.  See, I have no idea.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Reminds me of...    "You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on."  Joe E Lewis.  This reminded me of the 'good ol days' when i used to think my drinking was a normality.. you know because you should logically be able to down two two-sixes before you are completely hammered..  &nbsp;    Crap of the day    &nbsp;  So I decided after talking with Brian that I actually didn't like the previous format for this page.. so I am trying something else for headers. I don't know If I like this one either... but maybe It will be more relevant to the topics I choose to discuss. Then again It could make things look too choppy and non-interesting.. so we will see.  &nbsp;  Oh my goodness, I actually remember the story I was going to tell that I totally lost in the nether regions of my brain!! Kaye and I were talking about her mother-in-law coming to town and all the cleaning she has to do. Well I was going to tell her this little story that gave me a good laugh :  It was September of 1998, and as you may or may not know my birthday is on the 18th. Well my mother had told me that she was going to send a large-ish parcel down for my birthday, and for Mark to go and pick it up for me because she was unable to wrap it and wanted it to be a surprise. So I had agreed and put Mark on the phone to iron out the details with my mom, and basically forgot about it. Well it was two nights before my birthday and I was fast asleep when I heard this really loud noise... I woke up to Mark vacuuming the living room, and the apartment looked SPOTLESS. As you can well imagine I was in a state of total shock and disbelief..  so I asked "why are you cleaning the house at 1am?"  "um.. i couldn't sleep.."  "you couldn't sleep.. and you chose to clean??"  "...um, ya... um... right"  So I stood there, jaw on the floor, until i figured it out. My mom was coming. At that moment I was laughing so hard I thought I would pee all over Marks nicely moped floor!!! I kid you not, Mark had never met my mother before this so it was a first time meet PLUS, he knows how angry I would have been if my mother showed up and my house was a disaster!! That was the day I decided I was concrete on marrying that man! Anyways, it was really funny to me &amp; just thought I would share.  &nbsp;  What else did I want to talk about?? I lost my train of thought again from remembering the thing I forgot.. and now I am forgetting the thing I was about to share because I figured out the other story... grrraahhh!!! Well, maybe I will remember and tomorrows post will be that much better to enjoy!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    The Silver Lining    &nbsp;  The dog stayed outside ALL day today and didn't bark at every little thing that moved!! I was so proud!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Word of the Day    &nbsp;   salient  .\SAY-lee-unt; SAYL-yunt\, adjective:  1. Shooting out or up; projecting.  2. Forcing itself on the attention; prominent; conspicuous; noticeable.  3. Leaping; springing; jumping.  &nbsp;  Her crop top showed off her new belly button ring, which was a really SALIENT effort to get the guys attention.  &nbsp;    An extra bit    &nbsp;  Three men were hiking through a forest when they came upon a large, raging  violent river. Needing to get on the other side, the first man prayed,  "God, please give me the strength to cross the river." Poof! God gave him  big  arms and strong legs and he was able to swim across in about 2 hours,  having almost drowned twice.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  After witnessing that, the second man prayed, "God, please give me strength  and the tools to cross the river." Poof! God gave him a rowboat and strong  arms and strong legs and he was able to row across in about an hour after  almost capsizing once.  &nbsp;  Seeing what happened to the first two men, the third man prayed, "God,  please give me the strength, the tools and the intelligence to cross this  river." Poof! He was turned into a woman. She checked the map, hiked one  hundred yards up stream and walked across the bridge.

        On the Plate     Deciding If I want to go to curves today or tomorrow... excersise is so much work!!   &nbsp;   Hour d'oeurves    "Nouvelle Cuisine, roughly translated, means: I can't believe I paid ninety-six dollars and I'm still hungry." Mike Kalin.  &nbsp; This little remark reminded me of my cousin Tony, we went out for a fancy coffee (Amber &amp; I, plus more people) and Tony was astonished by the bill stating: OH MY GOD!! EIGHTEEN FIFTY&nbsp; for three coffees!!! I could have went to Arbys and had EIGHTY SANDWICHES!!! Of course Arby's was having their 5 buck round up where you could get five sandwiches for five dollars... and eighty was a far off number... but it was really really funny at the time...   &nbsp;   Entree's     Mark and I were in the truck yesterday driving somewhere, and we passed this house with a trampoline in the yard.&nbsp; SO I casually asked him If he liked the trampoline in elementary or If he was scared. He informed me that he didn't have a trampoline at his school, and only remembered once being on a trampoline when he was like 4 and didn't remember If he was scared or not. Can you imagine not having a memory of being on a trampoline, and the feeling in your stomach upon bouncing just that little bit to high that you almost vomit?? I just couldn't imagine, so I asked If he had done anything that made his stomach do "whoop-dee-woos". You know what he said?? DO YOU?? He said "heh heh.. getting married"... LIke WTF!!! He compared the act of getting married to being in a death defying situation!!!!!!!!! LOL.. well I had to laugh, and as much as I tried to be all angry eyes at him, I was laughing too hard for a convincing glare. I must admit, It was like that on my end too, so I couldn't very well give him shit.. though I was going to try. "So you think getting married to me was that scary??"  "No, not to you.. just getting married in general... I wouldn't do it ever again" "you wouldn't get married again, or you wouldn't get married to ME again?" "Oh definitely the first one.. ya, the first one.." I just couldn't contain myself any longer, this was just to rediculous a topic and gawd only knows, if it went on, i would eventually trap Mark into some serious trouble.. it just happens that way. So, we get home and he had to go back to work *surprise*, but I wanted help with Kira because I had just come from working out and my arms are super tired after that and I usually can't lift Kira while she is still in the car seat (which she was sleeping and hadn't had a nap so I didn't want to pick her up and disturb her). He says "Funny all those muscles are no where to be seen when It's time to take the baby in..." Seriously folks, Mark had a near death experience, and like a good woman always should, I dragged the previous conversation into the argument as ammo. HA. Well we are fine and actually didn't fight long (mainly cuz we never do, and he also had to get to work and I hate it if we are mad and he goes to work and we haven't resolved stuff and he drives truck all over the place and could die then I would feel really guilty for the rest of my life *breathe*.), but still.. Note to men : always quit while you are BEHIND.   Watched Nip/Tuck tonight, that show just kicks ass. Period. I love this show, I have no idea why it was never on TV like ten years ago. Guess shows like extreme makeover paved the way to see If the viewers were really squeamish about seeing a person get carved up. I still have to look away though.. and Mark has to tell me when all the gore is done, I just can't handle it.... I don't need to know what cracking your bones look like, or getting your face jerked around, or worse being pulled down like some sort of halloween mask *EEWW* *BARF*. BUT, I still love the show, plus it has the character Christian Troy who used to be Cole in Charmed.. and he is a hottie *wink*. Although his character is a shit, and a total pig.. I feel really sorry for him this season.. like just when he gets an ounce of compassion he losses his "son". Sucks hardcore.. but Karma is a bitch. Also watched Big Brother 5.. that twin thing is totally cool! I thought I wasn;t going to like it (because lets face it, big brother "twists" usually suck ass), but this one i think is funny. I hope Adria makes it half way through just to see the look on the other contestants face.  &nbsp; While waiting for Big Brother to come on, I watched the first 10 minutes of the Pepsi Smash finale.. I was so happy because I love that song Avril Lavigne sings and I got to see Seether &amp; Evanescences Amy Lee sing live which I always wondered if her voice was really that kick ass... and it is. She gives me shivers, i love that. IN Edmonton while I was living with Tony (geez that guy keeps popping up!!), I used to borrow a speaker from his room and put it into the bathroom (the speaker was really big and really loud) while I had a bath in the most AWESOME bathtub known to man (It was one of those old antique looking ones that were super deep and you would have all appendages under water at the same time!!). I used to put my head under the water and listen to the acoustics of the music.. it was great, like being at a concert. I especially loved this one piano concerto, the one that is the theme song form the movie "The Piano'... that used to make me almost cry listening to it under water. Which is sort of ironic... because the character in the movie always felt like she was drowning, and at one point almost did. hmm... never thought of that till just now... I just think If you haven't heard music really loud under water, you haven't heard music period.  &nbsp;    Dessert     Kira likes to dance now, and her little bum is just the cutest thing in the world!! Bonus : she also loves trance!!! BUT she loves the wiggles more, so it's okay!!     Word of the Day      acuity . \uh-KYOO-uh-tee\, noun:Acuteness of perception or vision; sharpness   Her ACUITY was impeccable as the hair brush thwacked the man on the head.

        On the Plate    Trying to figure out why all the Englishes are different... like it's the same frickin language, so why all the weirdness??    Hour d'oeurves    "Whatever women do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good. Luckily, this is not difficult."  Charlotte Whitton. This was just plain funny.     Entree's    Why do people who are not the parent of my child feel the undieing need to tell me what I should or should not be doing with her?? Statements like 'why are you letting her nap so late', or 'should she really be eating that?' piss me right off. Do you know what kind of day I have had?? DO you know what my child likes or dislikes?? Do you know that it is none of you gawd damn business??!!          * Eish*, I really shouldn't have to go through this with people... especially people who I know. I don't do that to people out of respect and it is none of my buisness, what the hell happened to etiquette?? Ack, maybe I am being overly defensive, but geez... really.  On another note, I was at curves tonight and realized that the 20-40 sit-ups I have added to my daily work out is really hurting me on that ab machine. Which is good.. but loardy is it painful... kinda makes me wish I was happy being chunky. You ever meet a truly happy chunky person?? I haven't... we need to change the way the world thinks : fat is healthy!! Less stress, no upkeep!! And best of all, take out when ever you want! I mean you're going to die anyways, go out with a full belly of meat and deep fried crap in cheese!! Yep, a whole new outlook... I can see the glow...  Hmm, maybe I will just completely shock the system and do something different today. Not like Brazilian wax different *ouch*, but like make a page in Kira's scrap book different. Something I haven't done in awhile but costs zero dollars. Yes... maybe. I am trying to save a bit of cash for when we go to Montreal this september, about 500 bucks ought to cover it. We will after all only be there a week, and Its not like we are paying for accomodations. So basically it is just for spending money. We spent about 600 bucks in Mexico, and it was a fortune to do everything, and we went on three excursions.. so ya, 500 is a good number I hope. Last time I went to Montreal I spent a lot more money then planned... but I was 13 and had 150 bucks from babysitting, lol!!  SO now I have 17 days left of freedom and Kira-filled days until I have to go back to work. *ugh*. SO looking forward to that...!! I am trying to keep in mind that working makes money, money can be saved in a bank account, the bank likes to see money saved in your account, the bank gives you a mortgage, and then you get to buy a nice house with a pantry two bathrooms and a fan over the stove!! *Grin*... so this is why I am going back to work. All selfish-ish reasons I suppose, but I have to make my life work as well as Kira's, right? Right. Plus she will have the added bonus of not living in a trailer park like I did my entire childhood... not that it is a bad way to go, or that i don't appreciate the trouble my mother had to go through just to keep us in that park, just the idea of living in an actual house to me is more appealing. Most likely because even though I lived in the trailer and was comfortable living there, I was constantly reminded that It was a lower class place to live... which sucks because I shouldn't care what people think, and now I don't really, but I did then, and that formed my opinions of today... you get all that?? HAHAHAHA...Still, I have a daycare lined up for Kira, and hopefully she will be okay there. I am so afraid that they are going to break her.. she is so good. She hardly ever screams or throws tantrums, she babbles ALL the time, she smiles ALL the time, she laughs ALL the time. I would really hate to see the joi de vive sucked right out of her. I will watch for signs of unhappiness, and if she starts to weave into the anger side or what not I will pull her out and decide what to do next. Suppose that is all i can do for now.   On a plus side it is only 2 months away until we go to Montreal, and I am super excited about that trip. I know you have all heard it before... but It will be so cool to go into a provence Mark has never been too. I wish we had longer so we could go do all sorts of stuff... like take a tour of the churches there. I loved that when I was 13... which I know you must be laughing because you are thinkin "Mich? Church? you got the right girl there??", and normally you would be right If I were to attend Mass or anything. BUT we were just looking at the art, and architecture and all the neat furnishings and strange little antiquities. There was this one church, I can't remember the name of It now... but it had a saint that was like mummified or something preserved in a glass air tight casket at the front of the church on where the alter is. Freaky.. I loved It!! She was so stoic (of course) and just looked so peaceful... It was odd for me to see a dead person and not feel all the emotions that are usually involved with death.. no grief or that pain in your heart.. just an odd curiosity of the individual, and If she were In fact real. I tell ya, I learned a lot about how hard it is to be a saint.. and why I would never fall into that category! There was also a really cool sailors church that had all this nautical stuff all over the walls.. actually it looked like something one of the designers from trading spaces looked at and then subjected it on a home owner.... but the one really cool thing was it had all these casts and crutches and stuff all over the place.. and I didn't know what that was all about and my step gramma told me that they are from sailors who were considered lost at sea and returned to their families with what ever injuries the inccured.. and the casts, etc. are there for reminder that the ones lost can still be found.. like a ray of hope. I just thought that was a really nice idea and made me sniffle a bit because It was so bitter sweet.      Dessert    Mommy found a piece of gyp-rock in the basement to enclose the computer!!

        On the Plate    I have to clean my kitchen and maybe make some lunch. I am starving because we had chinese food for dinner last night, and i haven't eaten breakfast either.. so it is like double the hunger pains!! Ah, I could stand to have a few more hunger pains.    Hour d'oeurves   Congratulations, Michelene! Your IQ score is 127   This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the True IQ Test relative to others.   Your Intellectual Type is Insightful Linguist. This means you are highly intelligent and have the natural fluency of a writer and the visual and spatial strengths of an artist. Those skills contribute to your creative and expressive mind. And that's just some of what we know about you from your test results.      IQ Range	Classification	    140 and over	Genius or near genius	    120-140	Very superior intelligence	    110-120	Superior intelligence	    90-110	Normal or average intelligence	    80-90	Dullness	    70-80	Borderline deficiency	    Below 70	Definite feeble-mindedness	     take the test yourself at:   http://web.tickle.com/tests/real/index2.jsp?sid=1807&supp=groupb1redswinglineCPA35&z=      Entree's    So as pictured above here, I am supposedly of very superior intelligence. Well, we all knew that now didn't we?? BWAAHHAA... anyways, this sparked a nice little discussion between Mark and I. He thinks that this test is a total sham, you know because If I were really THAT intelligent I would be successful and be a doctor or something. I was totally amused by this, telling him that all that test does is rank your intelligence, not your personality and wisdom. So no matter if you are a genius or not, if you choose to do other things in your life you are still smart even though you may not be successful.  He rebutted with "Well if you were that smart you would know what path in life to take *duh*" .... man does this guy know how to push my buttons and bring me to the brink of murder.  So I say "That is SO not true.." in the most Chandler Bing style I could muster..."...If you don't measure success by wealth and instead by happiness, than a person is making the right path choice for themselves... and IF YOU can't see that.." ... okay, can anyone see where this is going?? I will tell you, a nice hour long fight on who actually loves who and to what extent. Brilliance in the making I tell you.  Other then the intelligence fight, we watched Big Brother 5.. which if that doesn't lower you IQ just from watching I would be surprised. Can you believe the crap in that house?? LIke anyone in the free world would not know Will is gay, that guy was more feminine than ME. And that "godfather" dude, well he isn't so smart and is an ass to boot. Like who needs that in the house?? And don't get me started on the stupid Diane.. like telling a guy that the girls have an alliance and then NOT inviting him to partake in the picking?? Loser. These people do not know how to play this game. Although I will say I was mildly entertained that the bimbo Holly has a mannequin. I bet she can't spell mannequin. Only reason this amused me was from my own mannequin.. Tori.. who was buried in the Bonnyville  garbage dump somewhere because we had to mave AGAIN, and alas she could not take another trip with her bad neck. ROFL... well I loved having her around, she rocked.  Actually Tori saved my  house once. I was living in Lethbridge in this four plex, and me and my roomies had gone out for dinner or something like that, and when we came home we found our door had beem pryed open and muddy foot prints all over the carpet.. leading all the way to the living room, then a quick sharp turn right back out of the apartment!! They must have seen Tori standing there in what I would consider a most stylish outfit (actually she had my bath robe on because i was in the middle of making a costume and she was naked.).. and bolted thinking she was a real person!! YAY!! Tori saved the day! I was totally happy, and nothing was taken, so all was good. LIfe lesson : when you can't afford for anything to be missing, buy a mannequin for guard duty.    Dessert    Kira has learned what the shiny red button on the power bar does.. and mommy has learned to save on a more regular basis...    Word of the Day    libation \ly-BAY-shun\, noun: 1. The act of pouring a liquid (usually wine) either on the ground or on a victim in sacrifice to some deity; also, the wine or liquid thus poured out. 2. A beverage, especially an alcoholic beverage. 3. An act or instance of drinking.  The LIBATION of the sleek necked glass spilled to the ground as mommy dropped her cosmopolitan...

        On the Plate:    So today we start a new home of journaling. Completely stolen from Kayeita, I have found a new home with rich templates and funny questions to answer. So here I will play until I get bored and move to some other neither region of the world wide web.   As stated in the "about me" section there to the left, I like to ramble. I will thus commence in my rambling.    hors d'oeuvre    Today I am breaking in a new fan. I have no clue If It is a good purchase, but if it is I will add It to the "what to get" column. So far is oscillates, it blows air, yep it's a fan.    Entrees    Well I have no real news today. I have got to go to curves at some point, and maybe I will eat a decent meal If I don't get overwhelmed by the heat. So far this week it has been raining so hard it is almost flood weather, been chaotic enough to warrant tornado watches, and been hot enough to cook an egg on the hood of your car in under a minute (which I do NOT suggest doing, it will ruin your paint job much to my mothers chagrin at age 11). So If this weather keeps up I am moving to B.C., and that's that!! I just hope It cools off a bit, I am not a summer sun person, in fact I am more a 'you are going to scorch even if you wear 2 layers of clothes and 65 SPF sunscreen' type of person... so I am not going outside today much to my babies disappointment.   Tonight I think Big Brother is on, other than that I will be melting away on our sofa watching whatever crap the stations are playing.. I hate summer T.V.    Dessert    I have managed to make up an entire entry and I even posted in my live journal journal... YAY!! I totally rock!     Word of the Day    supernal \soo-PUR-nuhl\, adjective: 1. Being in or coming from the heavens or a higher place or region. 2. Relating or belonging to things above; celestial; heavenly. 3. Lofty; of surpassing excellence.  hmm...

      Just a pic of the road to Bonnyville. I enjoyed the sun being red, and not burning my retna's out.        On my Mind    I had a dream last night, I had another baby (a girl) and she was on the change table at the daycare Kira attends. She was all alone and undressed, waiting for someone to attend to her. And I couldn’t move, and as soon as she saw me she started to happily coo and scramble her way off the table to me. She fell off the table Into the biggest pit I have ever seen and vanished. I know I was crying because I could feel my chest throb, but I was Immobile. What do you think this means??    Crap of the day    You know what I value now that kids just don’t get?? Quiet time. It’s so funny, I would really like to know what age kids are before they learn a quiet room and a book are like “gods” way of saying life Is good!! For me I simply can’t remember when that age was. I am not sure If It was an evolution of thought process on the matter, or If It just happened In one fell swoop. Another thing I value now that wasn’t so big on the priority list? Reading. I am so happy that I get my measly half hour of reading time all to me. I don’t care If It has to be at work, and I am glad that It Isn’t taking away from my baby fun time, so I can honestly say this would be the one thing I love about my job. Of course It’s not a paid break, that would make It 100% better… but hey, can’t win ‘em all.  So I went for my first two hour driving session today, and It actually wasn’t bad. I thought I was just going to be a nervous wreak and fuck things up royally, but Instead It was fairly calming, and I did well!! I was told, by a professional driving Instructor, that I drove very well!! YAY!!! So I guess I wasn’t all that bad. I do however need to learn to parallel park (haven’t EVER done It) so I do that next weekend, and I had to learn not to “dry steer” , which s turning your wheel when you are not moving the car. Apparently she has never met a person that didn’t do this, and that’s one of the marks on the driving tests that 99.9% of people get a point deduction for. So I have to work on that.  I also have my next four sessions all next weekend. Saturday and Sunday at 10am and 3pm for two hours each. This will take care of my whole ten hour requirement, and hopefully after that I will have my certification and get my damn license. I am also trying to book my drivers road test for the Monday (the 23rd), so I MIGHT be running over pedestrians next week! YAY!! Ohhhh.. the power of the laminated license!!!  Kira had a rough day today.. well so did we all. We got Into a “mini accident” today on the road between Bonnyville and Glendon. This dump truck ( I think Is what It was) had a malfunction In It’s back door, so all this gravel came POURING out of the truck INTO MY WINDSHIELD!!!! It sounded awful, couldn’t tell you what It looked like cuz I did the whole duck and cover thing (good thing Mark was driving heh!). But, our windshield was pelted with rock punctures, splits and sniggers, PLUS one went right through, and there was glass on my dashboard!!! SO Mark went and got the guy, talked to the boss of the company and we are getting all damages paid for by them. Thank god, because I was livid, and having Kira IN the car while this happened was not fun. She freaked because we were screaming and saying “fuck” a lot… so It was a trauma to us all. I swear, the more I drive that particular road, the more I don’t want to be there. It’s just nuts. Deer, gravel, country bumpkins, tractors, quads. It just sucks on that road.   .  The Silver Lining    After forgetting the name of a book I wanted to pick up for my step-father this Christmas.. I finally remembered It and I would recommend It to anyone!! It’s called Villains by Necessity by Eve Forward. But don’t try to get It at Amazon.com, apparently one guy has a copy and It Is selling for 85 bucks cndn!!!    Something Amusing To Me   Another thing I saw that was funny:                                               If women ruled the world        Myth:  The Vikings believed that the Northern lights which are seen from time to time in the north sky were caused by the flashing armor and spears of Odin's handmaidens as they rode  out to collect warriors slain in battle.~ This was just a nifty little stumbling, since I lived amongst northern lights for so long and never knew this particular Myth on It. Funny how you take for granted things you have all the time. I miss the lights…

        On my Mind    Remember that whole dentist Inquiry?? Well, now It Is a definite, I need to get this tooth out now!!!    Crap of the day    It was a strange week. I had my ups, I had my downs, I had my side-to-sides. BUT, I lived to tell the tale so I must be doing something right!! I am invoking the pity of my boss at least. He and his wife had a baby about three months before me, so he Is very understanding of the wiped out feeling I am experiencing. Not that he will be the greatest boss In the world and provide his pity In the best way an employer can give It.. a raise!!  But at least he knows what I am going through, and when I couldn’t go Into work on Tuesday because Kira was Ill, he wasn’t mad or resentful. So I suppose that’s a plus.  I was almost IN the state of a killer today, and I will explain without naming names (you know who you are dude). Basically one of the worst things you can EVER do to me Is hang up on me. I hate that with a fiery vengeance. I don’t care If you talk smack, I don’t care If you get down right verbally abusive, I don’t care If you tell me you are going to go because you are mad and WAIT FOR ME TO SAY SOMETHING. But to just hang up on me?? Fuck no. Well needless to say said “dude” Is paying a hefty price and shall be In atonement for quite some time In my books. Lesson of the day: don’t be a rude jack ass when you can just be an ass.  Kira has figured out a neat little trick (much to my inauspicious life), she has figured out how to pour the water out of my water cooler all over the floor!! It Is really cold, and she cried bloody murder when she did It (because naturally It soaked her), and hopefully she will remember that the next time she goes to pull that little lever. Not a likely scenario, but I can dream.  I think I might be getting a touch of a cold. My throat Is all wonky and my nose Is a bit stuffy. Hopefully this will pass quickly and not bother Kira. I remember a time when I wouldn’t care If I got sick cuz It just meant a few days off work reading a book or two, lying IN bed and drinking tea from a carafe. Ya right, those were the days!!! Now I hope and pray nothing goes wrong because I don’t have the time to get better, or to get kira sick too!! Man do things ever change.  Kira has also started walking around quite a lot now. We have had to baby proof our whole house… and that Is hard to upkeep, lemme tell ya!! That girl will find EVERY little speck of everything! I didn’t notice the bounce sheet fly off the clothes when I brought them upstairs.. well I sure noticed when she had It IN HER MOUTH three seconds later!! She Is a freak, she puts everything In her mouth.. nothing abnormal for babies I guess, but It sure makes me sweep the floor a helluva lot more!!  I talked to my brother and guess what?? He got a new job!! I wasn’t aware that he was even looking… but whateva. He started working for a computer related place (can’t really specify cuz then It would be obvious), and Is happy learning his new job. Poor guy has to wake up SOOO early though, he has to be at the bus stop for 4:45am or no worky for Jay-Jay!!! I think this Is the earliest I have ever known him to wake up.. so I feel sorry for him. I know what that time IN the morning feels like (I used to work the morning shift at Smitty’s, so I had to be there at 4:30am to start the coffee and what not when we opened at 5), and It Isn’t fun. Especially since he doesn’t get off at like 1pm or anything, he gets off at 5.. then has to bus ALL the way back. So It’s a big long tiring day. I don’t feel TOO bad though, I mean I had to do It too, so It’s not like a heroic effort or anything. I just know that early In the morning sucks. But hey, If he likes his job It’s all worth It… not like he’s doing It to go and work at Tims….lol.  This Is a little weird cuz I started writing this post yesterday (Friday) and am finishing It up today (Saturday) but all my tenses are all wonky and so It’s like I smushed two days Into one, and It doesn’t make sense In my head. Well, not like YOU guys can tell, but head smushing makes me dizzy. So I just had to tell you this Info so that my head doesn’t smosh. Capiech? K.  I got to sleep In (7:30am Woot!), and I am having a vry productive morning thus far. I have loaded the dishwasher thru the week, so now It Is running. I have separated my clothes and have three loads of laundry (one Is In the washer, and I have been doing lots thru the week too, so It’s not as If I have all the laundry fro the week to do, yikes!). I still need to vacuum, but the bug Is still playing around on the floor, so I will wait. And I have eaten a healthy breakfast (raisin bran) . So I suppose It’s off to a good start.  We are going to Glendon after Mark gets off work today. I have my first session driving tomorrow, and Mark has his first two days off since March eighth!!! He Is so happy, but has no Idea what to do with himself on Monday. Sunday Is fine, we will be with his family, but on Monday It will just be him and Kira. So that makes for an Interesting day!! I am sure It will go fine, but he Is more concerned with what HE will do because he can’t sit still anymore. He will be on the couch, relaxing, then all of a sudden get up and start working on his paper work or something. I told him If he was really concerned, he could always clean the fucking house!!! Hahaha.. I know, I’m evil.  Any-who, still need to get my house clean and organized.. and need to take a trip Into Wal~Mart (I haven’t been there In over a  week *ack*!!). So have a good weekend guys, see you Monday!!!   .  The Silver Lining    I got to sleep In!!!! Oh, and a trip to Wal~Mart Yippy!!!    Something Amusing To Me    Myths:  One legend claims stealing someone's shadow (by measuring it against a wall and driving a nail through its head) can turn the victim into a vampire.    That Is just cool. I am going to make Mark do that over the weekend. Although I dunno about the whole pleasure factor he might get from driving a nail thru my head…

        On my Mind    Seems like I can’t start a paragraph without the words “well”,“so” or “Anyways”. I suck. I know this. Deal.    Crap of the day    Well (haha), It Is hotter than the sun here today. I hate summer. I just get all sticky and stuffy and tired, which hasn’t been a great thing to add to my already exhausting week. I get up, I get myself ready, I get Kira ready, I wake up Mark, I drop Kira off at daycare, I go to work, I walk to Curves, I workout at Curves, I pick Kira up from daycare, I come home. You think It would be done there. Not so much. I then get Kira’s daycare stuff ready for the next day, my bag ready for the next day, Kira fed, my supper made(Mark Isn’t home and I told Ken he could start cooking for himself, I ain’t his slave), dishes done, dog’s walk, Kira’s bath, return all the phone calls that I had put off until 9pm ( I am an ungrateful shit, I know this, deal) then wait for the time when Mark finally gets home, jump In the shower and then bed. I know, bitch bitch bitch. But I am extra tired today and HOTTER THAN THE SUN. You will all love me again once It’s fall… I have a better disposition.  Poor Kira, she has to deal with the bitchiest mother ever and not have the words to tell me to fuck right off. Well, she gets her point across well at least. She actually doesn’t see the hot-headed mommy, I reserve that for things like.. oh I don’t know, Ken and Mark *Devil Horns*!! Actually I am not too pissy, I just complain extra lots to anyone I can subject It on when I get this tired and hot. Okay, well I suppose I should actually talk about stuff now, you must be sick to death of this stuff.  I go for my first bout of drivers Ed driving on Sunday. I get to go for 2.5 hours *yippy* and then I have the next weekend booked as well. I was hoping to get It all done In two weekends, but we shall see. I was also supposed to practice driving this week, but the moron I am, I left my purse at my In-Laws last weekend so I have no license. Sometimes I really wonder where I get my swiftness from.  I have no Idea If/when my father Is suppose to be coming south. I talk to him and his plans change every time. I don’t really “care” per say what he chooses to do In his life, but I would like to know when to expect company, and for HOW LONG. I am sure you don’t need me to tell any of you just how awkward It Is to be In a situation of not knowing the duration of “company”. Not that I don’t like or get along with my father, I just don’t want to live with my parents.. hence the whole paying my own way and working thing. Sometimes I get a little confused on what to feel with my father. Sometimes It’s like we connect totally and can talk about anything. Other times, It’s like I am trying to figure out the game, and what exactly Is truth and lies. I hate that, and he will tell me that he never lies to me, and my mother will tell me she never lies to me, but there In lies the catch 22. Neither story matches up with one another, and I was like five when they separated, so all I remember was the constant fighting and hiding nude the Ironing board so I didn’t get caught In the crossfire. Trying to figure out my relationship with my father Is too difficult because I have to look Into the past, and It Is always so hazy and harsh. So all I can do Is move forwards, and hope that he doesn’t put me In a position of having to non-politely tell him he can’t stay here that long.  I am a solitary person I think. I love living with Mark (which works well with the whole married Issue..lol), and I love living with Kira (or for Kira.. she isn’t so much a roommate as a guest In a swanky hotel where I am her personal servant, lol), but other people?? I have just grown out of It. And besides, who wants to live with their parents anyways?? That’s the bonus of growing up!! I just have a tough time expressing myself without sounding abrasive, so I just have a tendency to shut up around my folks, and not rock the boat. I am a coward with them, but I figure I had made their lives hell when I was younger, I can hold back a little for their sake now. I am reading again *yay*!!! I finally have some time, I get two fifteen minute breaks at work, so I grab my water and my book and just veg. It’s great, that little amount of time Is where I used to do the majority of my reading before and I never realized that. See what you take for granted?? lol!! Anyways, I am reading the first book In the Eye of the World series by Robert Jordan. I have read this one before, but I never got a chance to read any of the other ones after that, and now I have the first nine.. so I figure I should get cracking!! Plus I have a whack load of books that Dave sent me (I am so loving that guy about now, but IN the “he’s an asshole but he reads good shit” kind of way. He get’s It.), so I need to catch up. All this time of not having a series of books, and BLAMMO, there ya go, six full series In a row, enjoy!! Ah well, you just can’t bitch about having a book to read.  OH YEAH!!! Something else that I thought was totally cool, Kira learned how to play a variation of musical chairs at daycare today! It was so cute!! They would stop the music and say “okay, up Into the chairs, hurry hurry!!” and all the little babies would scramble them selves Into the chairs (not sitting all prim and proper, just legs hang out all over and excited little happy noises)!! It was so adorable!! My baby Is a genius. I’m telling you. .    The Silver Lining    Well, I started out pissy at the beginning of this entry, and now I am not so bad and ready for bed. Yay bed!!!    Something Amusing To Me    Everything amuses me when I’m this tired.. It’s like running on fumes… look at all the pretty colors…!!!

        On my Mind    Well a few things, which are detailed below,… but I am also thinking of getting a new set of gym clothes. My Husky pants have a dryer hole In the leg, and It is just staring at me when ever I go on the leg machines. I bring my legs forward, the hole gets bigger.. push legs away, hole gets smaller… It Is really distracting when I am trying to count and not worry about the state of my pants.    Crap of the day    Well another exciting day In the saga of Kira-hood. I mentioned that Kira was all sick and fevery and whatnot right? Well, I went to pick her up from daycare yesterday (Wednesday) and she had SPOTS all over her body!! So the first thing I think Is?? Chicken pox’s of course. But this looked different, and she wasn’t Itchy. So I took her to the hospital (couldn’t get Into see my doctor again) and the doctor there told me she had fifth disease. I freaked out Initially (lets face It, a doctor tells you your child has a disease, you aren’t exactly suppose to be calm.), but he explained that It Is a strain of Strep and that she was In the end of the cycle. Apparently kids get this all the time, and why It Is called fifth disease Is because they have a fever for four to five days, and then break out IN a rash on the fifth day. So she isn’t contagious or anything (she was some time last week haha) and she can go back to daycare tomorrow.  Another thing we were talking to this doctor about Is Kira’s nasty cough. I explained that It comes on almost every night, and some times during the day. And when she gets a little sick, It sounds like we have a smoker In the house again her cough Is so bad. He told us that It could be one of three things, one: nothing to worry about It was just saliva from teething. Two: Some normal non-growth In the sphincter that will adjust Itself as she grows older, or Three It’s Asthma and/or allergies. If It Is the third, then the next time she gets all coughy we have to bring her Into see our doctor and get her air way checked while she Is being affected by the cough. Then we would be able to rule It out. Now, I know my grandfather had asthma and Marks brother does from allergies, so this could very well be a possibility. I was only pissy about this for the first moment when I thought about Kayes reason to still breastfeed, and that was to decrease her babies chance of asthma since she has It. I felt really bad for about twenty minutes, but It passed, and I am sure she will be fine and me deciding to feed her Instead of starving her was the best route. I just needed a moment of clarity.  I also had a strange and awful day at work yesterday. I was being jerked around by two managers, who were fighting between them selves and getting me caught In the middle. Have I mentioned that I hate my job, and I hate people?? Ya. Anyways, these two Idiots, after fucking up my whole day had the audacity to start trying to tell me what to do and why their way was ultimately way more superior than the other… I don’t really react well to monkey In the middle, so I just put down my little clip board and said  “Listen, I have no Idea what your job Is, but I know what mine Is. It doesn’t Include listening to a couple of children fighting over who Is the boss and who’s Ideas are better than who’s. So I tell you what, you both can go do your own thing and leave me the hell out of It, I have work to do!!”  Well as you may have guessed this mad for a really bad afternoon, and I mean BAD. So when Joesephine came IN today and offered me a job at A&W I really considered It. Joesephine used to work with me @ Tim’s a few years ago, and Is now the manager of the A&amp;W on the west end and makes a good salary with benefits. She told me she would hire me on at my rate of pay at Tim’s, and be eligible for a raise In three months. So I don’t know, It’s still the same shit, so I am hesitant. But I can tell you that I don’t need to be Involved IN the crap that Is going on at my work… and It Isn’t about to get easier there. I know this for a fact. Something to think about, and a way out If I need.  I went to Curves ® today too, and boy did I go hard on those leg pully-uppy-thingys. My thighs are so sore right now I feel like a jello mold. I was talking to this girl who works there though, and we had a really good conversation about music and just what life was like ‘when we were young’. I was telling her about these clubs I went to In Edmonton, and how fun It was just to dance and dance, no cares or worries. Now It’s like “hhmm… dance until 8am?? Who Is going to watch my child all day so I can sleep, then work to pay for the watching of the child, then do all the laundry all that other stuff requires..” lol. I am just too old for that now. I will just have to settle for listening to my music at a dull roar. Hahaha    The Silver Lining    Kira has three more weeks to go before she can get the chicken ox vaccination.. so this was a scare, but she might make It!!    Something Amusing To Me    The first person killed in an airplane accident was Lt. Thomas E. Selfridge. On September 17, 1908, Selfridge was a passenger with Orville Wright, in a demonstration flight at Fort Myer, Virginia, when the crash occurred. Wright survived the crash. The first pilot of a powered airplane to be killed was Eugène Lefèbvre in France, on September 7, 1909.  Everything bad seems to happen In September. I actually changed my birthday to November 2nd like seven years ago… never caught on. Well, actually a hurricane called hurricane MITCH passed through south America and killed like a ba-jillion people on the first celebration of my new b-day, so I just took It as a sign not to mess with mother nature.

        On my Mind    I want to know why my hand hurts. I have this searing pain running up between my index and middle finger on my left hand. I don’t do anything strenuous (not with my hands) and I don’t remember hurting It…  Maybe It Is just on strike from having to pour coffee Instead of typing!! Evil brain telling hand to serve…noooo…    Crap of the day    I was a little bored from Kira being sick and sleepy… so I started looking at the real estate around here. There are a few deals that Mark and I are going to look Into. I really really really want my own house. I know I have stressed this point enough, but I would just like to be IN a place that was 100% mine. Well of course It would be Marks too… but lets face It, not like the guy will come shopping for throw pillows.  Looking at a few other options too, like moving Into the city, which I don’t know If that will happen or not. So Mark Is going to have a chat with is boss, see what his options are, and go from there. But looking at real estate can’t hurt right?? lol…  Like I said, Kira was sick and sleepy, so I was really bored. I couldn’t clean (to loud) I couldn’t watch TV (nothing on anyways) I couldn’t read (my eyes are too sore), so I basically surfed the web and flipped through magazines until she woke up. Fun fun.  I also did something I know I should never do, I watched Oprah. I should always just pass It by, but NNOOO, had to sit there and watch these poor women tell their stories of terror as their ex-husbands shot their children and now just want to die. I always get upset and cry and hold Kira till she fusses and squiggles her way free of the crazy lady sitting where her mom used to be. So now there Is this combination of Insane parent and bored parent trying to figure out what to do with her child. I am pretty sure only booze at this point could make matters worse for poor Kira. Do you know what I hate to do more than anything else In this world?? Wait. I have to wait all the time, and I realize that just life blah blah blah… but I’m seriously not liking It. So you are asking yourself ‘why does she care all of a sudden If she has to wait for anything?’… well I’ll tell ya: there Is a parcel In the mail. Mark went to go and pick It up. It’s a box that Is full of books I have wanted to read, and Dave finally sent them to me. And so now I have to wait and wait AND WAIT until Mark feels he has tortured me enough, comes home, and lets me crack new spines In glee. I have no patients, and I am not very virtuous, so I go a little nuts waiting for things. I get overly excited and anxious and then tired from expending so much energy moving around like a crazed lunatic, scrubbing counters and bugging the shit out of the dog. Just a mental note, I don’t know why I always say “crazed lunatic”, one would think that a lunatic was crazed so there for Is a redundant statement… I need help.  Mark and I got to have lunch together for the first time In … well.. I honestly don’t remember when the last time we had lunch was. We has BLT’s which were very yummy, and I think I will cook something for super too since I have all this free time that normally gets soaked up by work *ugh*. Maybe chicken fajita’s. I make these deadly fajita’s, with red, yellow and green peppers, chicken (duh) and sweet onion. Tossed In my secret fajita sauce (old el paso packet hehe) and wrapped with cheddar cheese and salsa In a warm tortilla… *drool*… ya, we be havin’ those for dinner!! Of course I could take a picture of these and make you drool too.. but I am mean, and If you want to know what the taste like or look like, well you are more than welcome to come for dinner. HA.  There Is a god damn fly buzzing around here and just generally annoying the crap out of me. That stupid thing had either a) DIE or b) get out of my house! I am buying a fly swatter today, and I will remember to squash It like.. well like a bug. The bugs now seem like they are IN hoards and swarm over me all the time. I remember thinking that the bugs were never that bad unless you went to Long Lake (then the horse flies would eat you alive) or camping IN the bush (those are some seriously nasty bugs). Now It just seems like they are there ALL THE TIME…. I hate summer.  I have done nothing with my diet/exercise lately. I suck. I still go to Curves ® but I missed a day last week from being so sore, and this week I am determined to go the three times. But I have been eating terribly and thus far have gained back 7 pounds. I know, don’t get down, just pick back up and start a fresh. I was doing so well though, then I got all stressed out from the work, daycare, driving things and all of a sudden I am back Into the same old routine eating that got me to this weight In the first place. And I saw It coming, and didn’t do a damn thing to prevent It. But on another note, I like Tim Horton’s cake donuts since they started baking them *grin*. Yep, I suck. Oh well, I will try again here soon… notice the hesitation and no definitive planning.. lol.    The Silver Lining    Well, Jace Is on the block and Marissa got the shaft. At least reality TV Is going my way...!!    Something Amusing To Me    "Life is a sexually transmitted disease and the mortality rate is one hundred percent." ~RD Laing.  Just plain true. Especially If you look around you and see the things that pass as human doing their daily drudge.

        On my Mind    I think I need new glasses. Not that mine suck, I just need a new look on my face. You know??    Crap of the day    I am tired. I don’t remember ever being this tired. I am just trying to stay awake and think good happy awake thoughts. I was up now for two nights way more than I should. The first night (Sunday night), we were just getting back Into town around 9:30pm, so I had some stuff to do and unpack our things, etc. I didn’t get to bed until 11-11:30ish. Then I was woken up at 4:30am from Kira hacking up a lung!! I know I have been to the doctors a few times now about her cough, and they say she Is fine… but this Is bad, and way worse then before. I would be bitching about doctors right about now, but this came from two doctors I respect… so I will listen even If I have doubts. At any rate, I was up early which wasn’t terrible seeing as though I would have been up by five anyways. That half hour sure makes a helluva difference though, especially when It means the difference between 5.5 hours of sleep, or 6.5 cuz you hit the snooze button…lol.  After all that I was TIRED yesterday. So we came home from work/daycare and basically lounged around for a bit. I hear a ringing of a doorbell, and I honestly didn’t register that It may be MY door!! We don’t get visitors unannounced, and we have like zero friends out this way. To my surprise It was Chris!! He was driving back from New York (his sister got a teaching job there and moved from little Yellowknife to the Bronx!!). He stopped IN for about an hour and a half, then off he went to Edmonton for some Taco Bell (bastard!).  After that, we just had supper, gave Kira a bath, and both of us crashed on the couch. Mark came home at 9-9:30 and took Kira up to bed and attempted the process of waking a hibernating bear. It worked eventually, but I was so tired that I could have just fallen asleep on the couch the whole night. Well, until around 11-ish, which Is where Iwill go next.  Kira was up at 11, and 11:45, and 12:15, and 1, and so on and so forth until 5:15am (when my alarm Is suppose to go off) with a fever that would not break. It finally broke around 6:30am, but I can’t just say ‘Okay, time for daycare and work now that you have no fever”. She Is still sleeping, and I have just woke up. I will most likely stay home just until Mark gets off of work today (he only has to do some shmoozing with a client), then go In to work for half of my shift. I don’t want to… but I should. We will see how that plan goes!!  Kira Is fine now (don’t know If you got that up there) and she Isn’t hotter than the sun, so I don’t need to worry to much. I was going to make a doctors appointment If she was still sick today, but I think she might be okay. Suppose It Is normal for kids to be sick within their first few weeks of daycare… just getting used to all the other germs and whatnot. Still, Kira never gets sick like that, so I was worried.  The really sucky part of today?? Although Kira may be fine… my house Isn’t. So I have to use this time to my advantage here. On come the karmic pay back for the lovely weekend of no dishes…lol!!!  Mark Is about to get his days off here. His trainee Is taking over as a full fledged swing driver and Mark will have this Sunday Monday off, yippy!! Now the thing about this, Is trying to get his mind away from work for that time frame. Not as easy as one may think. He Is a constant worry-wart and just loves having total control over his route. So now he Is getting all ancy and It Isn’t even his day off yet!! He will also be training another guy In about three weeks. Mark didn’t think that he would be training again so soon, but hey It’s another 300 bucks In our pocket when he does It, so bring ‘em on!!  Not to be gross or anything, but I have this bump on my leg that hurts like hell. I think It might be a spider bite or an ingrown hair… not sure. All I know Is that for one little pore, It sure makes my whole leg throb. I hate It when that happens… something so small just hurts like heck and then you like gash yourself and It barely hurts at all. Seems so wrong. But It happens to me (the little things that Is) all the time.  It's tuesday so I have a few shows to watch tonight (yay!!). I of course will be watching Big Brother... wouldn't It be so funny If they changed the veto power so that If no one wins In no one gets It??hahaha.. well Marvin would be gone, but It would still be funny that Jace stayed because of them again!! I will also be watcing Sex In The City ( I really love that show now) and Outback Jack. I think It Is the finally tonight. I think this show Is just hillarious, and have found It pure entertainment... and Mark likes It too, so It stays on. But like I said, I think It's the end, and If he picks Marrisa (which I am sure he will) I will be disgusted. What a ho bitch that Marissa!! Ah well, not my life!!  Well I should get cracking on my house while Kira Is still sleeping, and maybe I should feed the poor dog. You know you are a bad pet owner when you look back on the day before and think “I feed the dog right??”. Ya, my dog Is loving me right about now Im’t sure.    The Silver Lining    Kiras fever broke, and I get to play hooky this morning heh heh.    Something Amusing To Me    Did you know that 90% of new drivers get Into an accident within the first year of obtaining their license?? So If you weren’t scared of me before..lol!!!

        On my Mind    I am wondering If the new dental office In town bills the patient or the insurance company.. I have a gaping hole In my tooth now (lost a filling) so I am In agony but can’t really afford the extra bill this month since the drivers ed thing was $420.    Crap of the day    I suppose I will start out on how my drivers training went… and I even made a bullet of points during the time there so I wouldn’t forget to mention anything lol!!! The first thing that I feel I MUST start out with Is this: how the hell do pre-pubescent boys live with their stench?? Please help me out on this one. I sat IN that damn room for TWO DAYS smelling that onion crossed with gym sock smell!!!  As a responsible parent you should not let your child walk out of the house smelling like an unearthed creature. You just shouldn’t. Now, having said that about the boys, the girls are just as bad with their seven dollar bottle of perfume practically Oozing from every pore!!!  I tell ya, I do not miss being a teenager for a second.  Okay, a few other annoyances (man am I ever getting old!!)… gum smacking!!! I HATE HATE HATE that constant crack of gum from behind you.. It Is so hard to concentrate! I swear, If Kira ever does that while I am In her vicinity, she Is getting the gum tore out of her mouth, scrubbed onto a very dirty surface and shoved back In!!! Well, I probably wouldn’t do that to her… but she will have to get out of my car and walk, which might actually end up being worse punishment anyways. Along with the nasty gum smacking hoodlum was the vibrating skitterish shit head RIGHT BEHIND MY SEAT, so of course he was fucking up my chair comfort!!! Then next to him was this creepy dude that should not only be way far away from any roads, but people too… this guy was seriously screwy and was telling his mother to “Shut the fuck up mom, I need to drive your shitty car so I can get the hell away from you and your fuck buddy”. So sweet. Rage issues will most certainly not be In his future… oh no…!!!  But enough of the bitching. I was amazed at how freaky-similar this was to every day high school In my teenage-hood. I walked Into the classroom, and immediately I went to the third seat on the right hand side of the room. Felt like the first day I walked Into Mr.Bowden’s English ten class.  It didn’t really strike me as something ironic until I started to look around at the “type”  of kids In that class and where they were all sitting. The idiot guys who had no buddies were all staggered In the class, the four guys who were friends were In a group off to the left hand back corner, there was a shy long haired girl up In the middle front taking notes (the only one besides me doing so), a brother and sister who were on opposite sides of the front of the class, and a girl who sat next to me with the awful bottle of exclamation or other such perfume on.  And all I could think was this was really normal. It has been twelve years since I was In Mr.Bowden’s class, and It felt like It was yesterday. Freaky I tell you.  All In all I think I have learned a fair bit. A few things I wasn’t aware off, but for the most part It was like a refresher of the stuff I studied In my learners. I am a little anxious to get the driving part out of the way (another 10 hours), but I am not as apprehensive. Mainly due to the fact that the car I will be In Is a Ford Focus 2003, and my Mother-In-Law owns one of those and let me drive It all weekend!! HAHA!!! So I at least know where the heck all the controls and gauges are!! Still a little freaked about having to drive Into the Cold Lake area because I don’t know It at all… but I am sure I will be fine.  The deer In that area are really bad though, and I saw quite a few In the ditches (both alive and dead). The worst thing that could happen to me on that road Is to hit another deer. I would never drive there again. Mark and I hit a deer On that road a few years ago, when we still had the Mercury Topaz… man did that ever do a ton of damage and hurt like hell. You never know how fast those blasted things can run In front of your car, right from a ditch you could have sworn you should have been able to see a seven foot tall creature In!! I hate wildlife, It scares me. This other time we drove   thru   this deer that had been hit by a semi and was severed In half on either side of the road. I puked so bad from that… the squishy noises and the bones..***EEWWWW **** I am getting nauseous thinking of It.  BUT, I did get to spend some time with Kira not having to worry about supper or cleaning or anything else!! Mark’s parents took really good care of us this weekend, and I feel much more relaxed then I think I would have had I’d taken the course In town next month. Also, Mark’s mommy cooks WAY better than I do!!! * Yum!!*    The Silver Lining    One step closer to a license, and didn’t do a single dish for three days.    Something Amusing To Me    This quote was hanging over the blackboard and It just stuck:  “People will forget what you said, they will forget what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel.”  I just really liked It.

        On my Mind    Going for my drivers course (16 hours of learning wtf a break pedal Is…) this weekend. Fun, fun.    Crap of the day    I know I have been posting In the afternoon, but I wrote this last night knowing I wouldn’t be able to post today. Basically I will be picked up by my father-In-law from Curves ® , pick up Kira from daycare then going to Glendon for the weekend. I am really excited about the driving course (because I will be one step closer to my license) but I am also really apprehensive about spending the entire weekend with my In-laws and no husband. Not that I don’t get along with them, It’s just weird. I have a tendency to say the way wrong thing at the exact wrong time… so I am just worried about making an ass of myself and hurting someone’s feelings. Mark helps me around people…lol, anyone IN real life can attest to me being a loud mouth schnook, So you can see why not having my “coach” around could be potentially dangerous.  Although my week has been really busy, I have no excuse for a few things that I should have mentioned. Not only In this journal, but In general. One thing being my baby girl turned 11 months old on Wednesday and I forgot. I know It Isn’t like a seriously monumental thing and I will be forgiven In the grand scheme of things… but I like to take a picture of her on the fourth of every month and just document the changes In her. Like her hair Is longer and curlier. Her smile now has six very visible teeth In It. She has balance now, and can walk albeit a cautious walk. She has acquired this laugh that just sounds so funny, like a tummy filled he-he-he. And I usually send out a bulk e-mail to friends and family of her monthly progress and the things she Is still working on. Did I do any of this?? No.  So now I feel guilty. I could have taken the picture today and just said It was from yesterday… but I just can’t. This may be one of the stupidest things I will have ever said, but I refuse to lie about anything concerning my daughter. I don’t care what It Is. I want every word that comes out of my mouth to be truth when It comes to her. I find that I by one way or another had to lie (or just not fill In the Info of the truth) to people In a lot of times In my life. Not that I am looking back on things In regret (those I felt bad about I have already dealt with acknowledged and apologized for), just that I know what this world expects and demands of us at times, and I just don’t ever want to be caught In any nature of lie regarding her. The only reason why I think this sounds so stupid Is because this statement comes off like I am a perpetual liar, and that Isn’t It at all, It’s just that I know people sometimes tell little white lies that do absolutely no harm to anyone, but It still an untruth, and I just don’t want that air around my daughter. Do you get that at all? I probably made that all come out wrong, I suck at telling my thoughts. At any rate, I feel guilty for that, but I am sure that once I e-mail my weekly statement to everyone I might feel a little more alleviated of that guilt.  Another thing I feel I have overlooked Is Mark helping out. He has been juggling his schedule as best he can to make sure Kira and I have been taken where we need to go. He has been extremely helpful around the house, and even though he Is just as or more tired than I, he has never snapped at either Kira or I. Total gold stars for that man. I just know I bitch about him frequently (lol) so I figured overlooking this part would just be shity of me.  I suppose In this week I have regained a part of me I had forgotten about as well. I have reclaimed my sense of accomplishment, not that I don’t think being a mother accomplishes anything. I just mean that I have defiantly achieved the goal of being a good mom (well I think I am doing a good job, Kira can tell you how awful I am In about thirteen years), and have figured out how to make my home and make It all work together. So this Is a new challenge and I think I am starting to figure out where It all fits In the wheel of time. Of course I am being highly optimistic and trying my best to make good of this situation I am In, so I might be seeing things through rose colored glasses. But I find that I am stronger then I thought I was, more reliable than I thought I was, and I am totally capable of being a mom and a totally separate person from a mom. I can be an adult, with adult conversations, and adult responsibilities, and adult problems. I can be tired and cranky and sad and happy. I can feel, and have my feelings hurt. I can just be me, and not feel guilty about that.  Well, as I have sucked up about five minutes of your time, I will end this little blather and come back Sunday or Monday with what will most likely be a completely different view than the one voiced above… because you know, I like to do that.     The Silver Lining    Today the silver lining will be my alarm clock being shut off at 5:15 am and not being reset until Monday morning. Have a good weekend guys!    Something Amusing To Me    This Isn’t a quote or a factoid or anything, this was just a general observance from Tim Horton’s. So I guess It Is a real life amusement to me.  I find It particularly funny when people go through the drive-thru at a restaurant and place their order, then end their request by saying “to go”.  Ie:/ “Can I please have a large decafe double double, to go?”  Like what the hell?? Not like I was expecting you to order your crap then come In to get It. People say the funniest things.

        On my Mind    Kira Isn’t drinking much formula anymore, but the doc says she’s fine. I just wonder how little formula Is really okay…    Crap of the day    Well today I remembered what the heck my job was, and fully outdid myself. I took over where ever, I pounded out orders, I fixed broken stuff, changed tills over and managed to stay In total control. Now my back hurts so bad I could cry, and my feet feel like I have run for a week. I desperately need to get back Into the ‘shape’ I was before I went on leave. I just don’t know how I did this day after day and not fall over from complete pain. Or maybe I should just say fuck It and get a desk job heh heh .  Mark Is going through ‘discussions’ with his boss about promotions and transfers and stuff… so I have no Idea where we sit now. We might end up here for a while longer, we might not. Nothing has really been said one way or the other… but we have always been aware of the possibility of a transfer Into the city. Well Into either cities really (Calgary or Edmonton), both have district office headquarters. I am not so crazy about Calgary though, so If we were to go anywhere I would prefer to go to Edmonton.   Now that we have a child though, I just don’t know If we are city material. I mean nothing against big cities, but the scare the bejesus out of me. I just know It has advantages In some ways, like big cities have a ton of resources and different mainstreams of educational facilities. More clubs (children’s organizations), more events, more everything. And later It would be better for self esteem (this Is totally a theory) because she wouldn’t be scared to go out Into the world because she grew up In a big place already. I just find that I diminish a lot of opportunities (or I had In the past) just because I was scared… and that came from small town thinking. But everything Is still way up In the air, and we are just talking In ”what If’s”.  Tonight I have a few loads of laundry to tend too, and I think It Is Thursday… ya.. so Big Brother Is on. That Diane, what a fucking moron!! I wanted to slap her the other night for not stuffing Jaces piggy FULL of those coins with her face on ‘em!!! Man, that guy just pisses me off, he’s an Idiot and an ass, I would like to see him go. BUT Adria and Natalie should both be IN the house after today… hahaha… that’s going to be great!!! Yet another little bend In the horseman plot!! OH!!! And Diane putting Marvin up?? Did she not HEAR Adria tell her NOT to do that because she would indeed be doing EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED??? Idiot. She deserves to go to.  Other then that, I can’t remember what the hell else Is on TV…. I know I will be In front of It ALL night though, lying down resting my poor broken back. Maybe I will call It a night with a few perkacet and Traditional Ale…lol.  As If… but I might try and find the robaxacet, Seriously people, why do we do this to ourselves???     The Silver Lining    Ummm, I’m not working right now, and I get to go to bed. That’s all I got.    Something Amusing To Me    Computers and hard drives aren't as fragile as they were a few years ago, but you're asking for trouble if you move your PC around while it is running. While your computer is running, its hard disk is very vulnerable. A tiny magnet literally floats less than a hair's breadth above a platter where data is stored. A minor bump can send the magnet skittering into the disk's surface. The damage can't be repaired. Not only will you need a new hard disk, but you'll likely lose the information the disk held.  ~I never knew this, I guess I just figured my mom was right and there were a fleet of tiny little elves doing all the work transcribing and whatnot… ya, I like that version better.

        On my Mind    Wondering what the heck to make for supper… no one home but me so I get to have whatever I want. So of course I am stumped.    Crap of the day    Today we begin what Is commonly known as the ride down hill. The part where everything Is no longer ‘new’. The part that lets you sleep at night because you know what you are In store for the next day, so the sound of your alarm clock In the morning does not jolt you out of bed and make your butterflies return to the pit of your stomach. Instead you press snooze and see how little time you really need to get ready In the morning and get yourself from point A to points B and C. Yep, this was the beginning of the end.  I was just thinking this morning that this always happens. Now I don’t know If you ever remember, but when you started a new job, any job, did you notice how bright It was? It seemed so much brighter In the moment, the lights were so iridescent you just soaked It all In. Then you look back on that day somewhere down the road, and think ‘how did It get so dark In here? How did this get so small?’ . Well It obviously didn’t take long for that to happen to me. Although this Is my old job and I should have expected this, I just wish It could be shiny for just a few days.  My husband asked me If I was sure If I wanted to be back at work. He said we could try and make It on his salary but he just didn’t know how well off we would be. I said no, because he already works hard enough as It Is, and I know he would end up having to get another job. He works as If he already has three jobs, so If he added one more, I would never see him. We just need to save up the money for a house and get rid of our truck payment, and maybe I would think about It again. But for now, It Is just inconceivable. HAHAHA, you ever watch the Princess Bride?? INCONCEEEEEIVVABLE!!! Hahaha…  I suppose It Isn’t all that bad, and maybe I am just tired and sore and missing my baby. I forgot what It was like to stand for eight strait hours then walk ten blocks to workout!!! I will get back Into the swing of things I am certain, just when Is going to be my point of breaking. My feet need to be gel’in, that’s all I know.  Okay, that stuff up there was all written this morning, and now I get one more thing to add… my back Is killing me. Men, you may want to avert you eyes because I am going Into detail about girly things. No one ever tells you that because of breast-feeding your boobs get permanently bigger and make your back all bent out of shape!! I hurt so damn bad, and I have the best support bra known to mankind on too. Of course yesterday I had to start my period too, so on top of aching back and feet, I also have killer cramps and bloating. Great.  Kira had another good day at daycare. According to her care giver she was so tired by ten this morning she wouldn’t eat lunch and just passed right out In mid spoon full!! I laughed because she has done this a few times before and has to be one of the cutest things to watch!! She Is going to end up being a laughing riot on Americas Funniest Home Videos one of these days… I will wait until she falls asleep In a plate of spaghetti or something!!    The Silver Lining    I had an awesome workout at curves today, I did a power workout and my ass hurts real bad!!    Something Amusing To Me    Factoid:  To "dandle" is to dance a child up and down on the knee or in the arms.  I never though there was a term for this!!! I suppose no one uses It because If you said you dandled your child someone might misconstrue It as diddle and god only knows that’s a bad thing to have a misunderstanding about!!    Word of the Day      providential   \prov-uh-DEN(T)-shuhl\, adjective: 1. Of or resulting from divine direction or superintendence. 2. Occurring through or as if through divine intervention ; peculiarly fortunate or appropriate.  She waltzed through the room barking orders as If by PROVIDENTIAL demand.

        On my Mind    Well I know this template Is really really pink, but you know what? I like It, so there!!    Crap of the day    SHE’S WALKING!!! SHE’S WALKING!!! I couldn’t believe my eyes!! Yesterday I went to make supper, and she was all happy standing and eating a crispy mini and *POOF *!!! She started to walk !!! I was so proud! Of course she Is still staggering and such, but she WALKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am just so thrilled at this moment, she shared this on the day before I had to work, so I feel lucky. My girl *sigh *.      To early for life, It's 5:30am and my mommy woke me up!!!       All dressed and ready to party!!   Wake up time- 5:03am. I am ready by 5:26am. Kira is ready by 5:32. Kira has finished her bottle by 5:45. I know we have to be out the door by 6:15am today and think to myself *I am wonder woman! I ca do this! Look at my ready child, and my crisp uniform! I got It all planned out! *. You know what I forgot?? A sleeping husband who shill needs to get ready…..  So we get to the daycare center and she totally crashed In the truck!! We brought her IN (Mark and I) and we put her down on a crash mat. I wanted to wake her up and let her know she was In another place.. I was afraid that she would wake up and not know where she was and be scared… but she was so tired I couldn’t wake her. SO I talked with Carol (One of her care givers) and she went through all the daily stuff with me (where to put stuff, what Kira needed etc) and off I went to work. I did cry a smidge, but I think I held my shit together pretty well.  When I got to work, man oh man were things strange. I thought I would have to ‘get used’ to things again and this process would take at least a week… ya right. By the end of my third hour I had people asking me what to do (because I was dressed like a supervisor so I SHOULD know what I’m doing), and like an old pro I just went with It and had the whole shift under my wing by the end of the day. My boss came In finally at 2:30 (half an hour before I was off) and was really amazed that It went so well, not for lack of confidence IN me, but because I didn’t know everything and still made the shift run smooth. Tomorrow will be a bit different because I will have another supervisor with me on shift, but hey, I did It and that’s all I care about. I knew a lot of the customers and they were asking about Kira and my life, etc… so that made It easier too.  After work I walked to Curves &#174 worked out and then went and picked up my poor girl. So, you know what?? She was absolutely FINE!!! Better than fine, she was totally good the whole day and was so happy to see me and Mark she squealed In delight! I was so happy that she missed us, felt good to know that she at least liked hanging with us now and again… hahaha. The other caregiver of the room left a note In my bag to commemorate her first day at day care, It reads:  Kira had a great first day! After she arrived she slept until 7:30. When she woke she played with her new friends. At morning snack she ate some cereal. She enjoyed playing with the new toys; she really likes the spinning top. There was much to see and do, she was very busy! For lunch she had vegetable stew, which she enjoyed. Kira went to sleep around noon, and slept for almost two hours. She was very easy to put to sleep. When she woke up she played quietly until the others woke up too. At 3:00 snack she enjoyed apple sauce and graham crackers. We had a great time getting to know Kira, and look forward to tomorrow. She is a wonderful child and very easy-going.  AAAWWWWWWWWWW!!!!! I loved It!! I was so thrilled to have her “first good report card”!!! I was just happy that she did so well, and makes It just not totally suck to go back to work. But, I must go, I have my girl home now and I want to spend some time with her before I have to make din-din and whatnot.  I will be posting regularly still, just not until after 5pm most days (as that’s when I get home).    The Silver Lining    Kira was happy, I lived through It, and Mark was able to fix his schedule around It all. Not a terrible day for adjusting.. nope not at all.

I love to read stuff that was obviously written elsewhere than Canada!!! ” Ice fogs frequently occur around Alaska, where temperatures may drop to -40 degrees Fahrenheit in winter”… indeed… lol!!!

        On my Mind    Today Is the last full day I will have with my daughter In a few weeks. *Sigh *, these are the things that make you want to cry.      Crap of the day    Well from playing around with the Blog templates I have figured out my picture problems. I suppose this should have been apparent before hand, but I could upload pictures from my msn homepage to livejournal, so I thought I could do the same for here. NO. So I had to do a whole route detour thing and get another picture hosting site that works with all sorts of programs from Flickr. I am really happy with this though, so now I can post pictures!! Yay!! Well I won’t be doing that all the time, but once In awhile when I need to actually show you all the thing I am bitching about, always helps to have a reference!!  I also got this cool tool that lets me make smileys !!  So I am way happy about that. I just need to figure out how to put the links I want onto the sidebar over there ----> and all will be well In the world!! Actually I think I have It down pat, I just need to tweak It a bit so It all looks groovy. I am really happy with myself, just being able to learn new things and figure stuff out on my own. I know It Isn’t rocket science, but It’s still really exciting and new. Yay me!!  I watched a few movies the night before last , we watched ‘win a date with Tad Hamilton’ and ‘The whole ten yards’. I was really disappointed by both movies. I knew that the first one would be more a teenage chick flick, so wasn’t overly heartbroken… but the second one I thought would have been really funny, but It really wasn’t. I was very disappointed by that, but hey, It was a sequel after all. I think next up on the viewing list Is ‘The Human Stain’ and ‘Confessions of a teen-aged drama queen’ . ‘Hildalgo’ also comes out soon *Drool … Viggo Mortensen *, and’ The passion of the Christ’. I know that last movie might seem a bit of a strange choice for me given my hate of Christianity and all.. but I would really like to see what they did to make It such an Instant epic. Plus I still like the story, even If I don’t much believe In It.  Oh I forgot to mention that we also watched scary movie 3 last night! It was… well exactly what It was suppose to be, funny and disgusting and stupid all In one. So It was actually the best out of the three, not because It was a GOOD movie, but because It gave what we expected from It. I suppose that’s all you look for In a movie now a days. When you get the really good movies It’s like a shock to the system because you just have It In the back of your head that the don’t make them anymore! I remember I didn’t really want to go and see the first Lord Of The Rings… It was just that I had read the books and loved them so much, and I had watched a version that was so pathetic – and cartoon, that I really didn’t want to spend 50 bucks In Edmonton to see It. So I waited until It wasn’t busy anymore, and saw It on a cheep night at our local theatre. I was kicking myself afterwards for not wanting to go!! I was blown away, literally. I was just so overcome with shock that I after the movie ended I just sat there with my jaw slacked and this glazed look over my eyes… Mark laughed and laughed… He wanted to go see this movie, and having It be great was the best revenge he could think of!! Ah well, It’s good to be wrong some days!!    Have to go to Wal~Mart soon * oh darn!! *, I need to get so much stuff ready for Tuesday It Isn’t funny. I have to get a new tub of wipes for Kira’s daycare, and an embroidery kit to put her name on her blanket and Laa-Laa. I have to get new shoes for work, and a few other basics. Now that the Wal~Mart here has a grocery section, I barely go anywhere else at all!! I go next door to Sobey’s for meat and produce – that’s It. I am sure all the other businesses must be choked with Wal~Mart right now, of course the hype will die off and all will go back to normality.. but until then those other stores must be gripping over their bottom numbers. I am a dedicated shopper of Wal~Mart though, so I don’t feel guilty for shirking my patronage elsewhere. Nope, I like the big corporate conglomerates, makes It easier on me, and hey, that’s all I ask for!!  The next couple of weeks are going to be really busy, and I just hope all goes well. Between work, daycare, curves, drivers training, eating and sleeping… I have no time for the next few weeks. At least It will all start to settle once I have my license. I should give the dog a bath somewhere In there too… she Is beginning to smell like nacho * ew *. I don’t know where she gets that from, maybe It was passed down from Marks feet to her fur… that’s possible. Still, nothing like a freshly washed dog to make your house seem even more cleaner than clean. Most people will bitch about a wet dog – and I agree they stink – but a WASHED dog Is like a walking air freshener!! Mmmm, vanilla and wild flowers.. yep, the dog SURE loves that!!      The Silver Lining    Ya, did I mention I was becoming a web blog genius?? hahaha      Something Amusing To Me    Factoid: During menstruation, the sensitivity of a woman's middle finger is reduced.  I would Imagine It Is so she doesn't sprain It during the frequent use of that time frame!!    Word of the Day      apotheosis   \uh-pah-thee-OH-sis; ap-uh-THEE-uh-sis\, noun, plural apotheoses \-seez\: 1. Elevation to divine rank or stature; deification. 2. An exalted or glorified example; a model of excellence orperfection of a kind.  As the woman watched Martha Stewart’s trial, she thought It tragic for one of such APOTHEOSES to fall Into such shame.

        On my Mind    About to watch Coronation Street, I am really tired today from a crappy sleep last nigh. I will rectify that with a nice healthy breakfast from McDonalds.. haha    Crap of the day    Well I have figured out that there Is next to no life early Saturday morning! I was on-line almost the whole time and saw no one!! I suppose If I wasn’t trying to get my schedule all IN order I wouldn’t have been awake then either!! I wonder if once all the timing and such Is all worked out, If we will be able to relax on the weekend and not have to wake up at the absurd hour of five. I think I might be dreaming here.. Then again, Kira Is very much like her dad and enjoys her sleep. So maybe the chance to sleep In on the weekends will appeal to her. Guess we will just have to wait and see!!  We had BBQ steak last night, It was super yummy. I love that Club House Seasoning, Montreal Steak Spice. Man, that stuff Is what makes a steak as far as I am concerned. I actually went down a notch In how I like my steak done, It used to be well done. Now I like medium to medium-well, just not as tough, tastes better. I think going to the Outback changed that for me, they cook their steaks the way you are really suppose to get them (very professional there) and I am always happy with what I get there. But I learned to like my steak medium-well, because there they actually cook the darned thing and don’t send It back to you still bleeding. I can’t handle the taste of blood, I could care less about the sight, but the taste Is evil.  On another ‘bloody’ note, our tap water tastes like blood. I am thinking It must be because of the high Iron here. Maybe that Is what blood tastes like? Iron? I haven’t the slightest. All I know Is I am no vampire, and I like my water to taste crisp and clean. I buy my water of course, have been a purchaser of water for my cooler since 1999. After I got married we moved out of Edmonton and I just got sick of drinking crappy water. Well Edmonton water was crap compared to Yellowknife water, but It beats Glendon water hands down. In Glendon when you boiled water, It left this ring of chemical sludge around the top of the pot from the mercury, NO WAY was I drinking that!! Anyways, I have a water cooler and I buy my water all the time, so the only time I really get tap water In my mouth Is from brushing my teeth and taking a shower. Not bad, but when you gulp down something that tastes like blood, not very good on the stomach. Of course Mark thinks I am completely Insane and tastes nothing unusual… but he made coffee from the Glendon water… lol.  Kira has started this really cute thing, when ever she goes to touch something she knows she Is normally not allowed to touch, but we have allowed her to – she opens and closes her hands really fast In a “oohhh… the temptation” kind of way!! It Is really cute, and I wish I could describe It better. She has also started having a bath without the bath ring, which Is good because she Is learning how to get around In the water, but she Is standing lots and freaking me right out! I don’t leave her alone anyways, but still, she just teeters and I feel like If I turn my head to get the soap she’s going to tip right out of the tub!! Freaky child, I wish we had some nature of Velcro gizmo to strap on to her some days.  Back to the thing about BBQing, I finally convinced Ken to clean the god damn BBQ, and now everything tastes like food Instead of dirt. Always a plus. I just hate having to berate people on food sanitation. I have worked In the food service Industry for far to long I think, I am permanently screwed In the head for ordering things at restaurants. Just a few pointers people, never ever order anything that has Strawberry sauce or glaze, never order everything on your plate to precise specifications, and never ever send back food without marking It some way so you KNOW It has been fixed. I’m telling you, I know what people do and you don’t want to eat that shit. Just trust me.  Big Brother was on last night, and oh my gawd am I happy about the outcome!! If you haven’t watched It DON’T READ AHEAD!!! Seriously couldn’t have done a more happy dance If I tried! Man oh man do those two jerks deserve to be on the block! Funny point here though, don’t you think Drew got of WAY easy?? Smart move what he did – aligning himself with the two ‘target-type’ jocks!! Made his brief stint as HOH totally forgettable to Diane.. well not totally, but not a big enough deal to make her hate him, or make Adria pissy. Man won’t he be shocked next week!! I just love how the odds are going to flip right around! That Scott-ass-take-the-frickin’-head-band-off-ALREADY Is going to die!! HAHAHAHAHAHA…. That’s all I have to say about that for now, I just can’t wait till next week!!     The Silver Lining    Today Is essentially set up just for me an Kira, no house work, no other things clouding our time. I wanted today and tomorrow to myelf and Kira, so that's what we are doing.    Something Amusing To Me    Factoid: According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, with 20.7 divorces out of every 1,000 married people, the U.S. leads the world in broken marriages. The closest "rival" for this dubious title is Denmark, with 13.1 divorces per 1,000 marriages.  You know, this actually made me feel really good! I thought the numbers were way higher then that! Nice to know marriage Is coming back on the up swing!!    Word of the Day      megrim   \MEE-grim\, 1. A migraine. 2. A fancy; a whim. 3. In the plural: lowness of spirits -- often with 'the'.  Taking the asprin on a MEGRIM will not relieve a MEGRIM. And leave you feeling the MEGRIMs. Hahahah!!!
