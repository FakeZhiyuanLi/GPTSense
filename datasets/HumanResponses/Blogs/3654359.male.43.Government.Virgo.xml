      so i went to lunch a few days ago at this new place off state street called yummy buffet. it was just opened by a chinese family who can barely speak english. probably new arrivals in our fine country. all-you-can-eat for six bucks. can't beat that. decent stuff too. anyways, i was eating my lunch and gradually became aware, over the course of five minutes or so, that a situation was developing at the cash register between a somewhat fat, dumpy, obnoxious, middle-aged woman and the chinese wife/owner of the establishment. the dumpy woman wasn't paying. that was clear. her credit card was coming back bad, and she said she had no check or cash. dumpy woman insists her card is just fine. so the owner suggests she leave her wallet, use her cash card, and come back to pay. dumpy woman says that she only has a few dollars left in her account, can't use the cash card. besides, she says, she ain't leaving her wallet with no one. but, she claims her credit card is good, if it wasn't for the owner's faulty credit card checking machine, she could pay just fine, thank you very much. ... yeah, right. anyways this goes on for a while. it was seeming to me to be a classic case of poor white trash trying to roll the unsuspecting immigrant -- or some such variation. i finally reach my limit. i go up to the two of them, and suggest that if the woman's credit card is indeed in top shape, and the singular problem is a faulty credit card device, then she could leave her wallet for safe-keeping, ambulate down the block to the nearest financial establishment, and get a cash advance on the credit card, come back and pay. no, this wouldn't do. you see, the dumpy woman is a busy person. can't waste time going to the bank to settle a six dollar check. that fucking did it for me. so, i says that her time is no longer the issue here. the issue is her paying her bill. i tell the owner that if dumpy woman refuses, call the cops on her. dumpy woman gets all bent at this. calls me a prick, and various other colorful reflections upon my character. tells me this ain't my business. i says, sure this ain't my business, but it ain't her business either, we're standing in this chinese woman's business, and one of us owes her six bucks, so pay up. this initiates another stream of choice verbal courtesies. calls me a prick again, and says she's leaving. i tell her to be responsible. bitch walks out. a young couple at a nearby table chuckle. i contemplate following dumpy woman and calling the cops with my cell. but my lunch is only half eaten. so i don't. but i pay for the skinflint when i leave. pissed me right off.

      okay.  since i didn't mention anything about earwigs in "is this the year for earwigs? part 1" i suppose i should somehow attempt to weave them into the narrative at some point soon. right about now perhaps. this may be an entirely local phenomenon, but i have noticed that around my new east-side digs there seems to be an embarassment of riches in the earwig department this year. the little buggers are everywhere. banner year for the little fucks. i lifted a barrel up from the back lawn, and i was interupting an earwig camp meeting. but, they hadn't started yet.  just finishing their sound check.  several days ago, i found a few inside my apartment. they asked for sanctuary i promptly squashed them. no questions asked. can't give the bastards sanctuary. next thing they'll be organizing, and making demands. the petitions start,  then the ultimatums. the governing bodies, and all those goddamn arbitration meetings. nope. best to sqaush 'em from the get-go.  i much prefer the crickets. they're a value-added experience.

      at the end of last summer, i was up to my ass in crickets. they were everywhere outside. i live on the second floor, and somehow they found me. the little bastards scaled the walls. i'm sure of it. i found very small rappelling lines. the tiniest of carabiners.  one was in the bathtub, and the other wandered freely about the apartment. they paid for their stay by chirping all night. i could have given them names, but they didn't seem particularly interested.  i didn't have the heart to dispense with them. although i must admit, i wasn't a very gracious host. i never offered them food. i could've put out some kind of spread. not that i know what they like. i don't but i could have looked it up on the internet. i'm sure it's there somewhere.  late at night, i would wake when the chirping stopped. it's then that i heard them on the phone. they were real quiet like. saying things like "i know i'm bad, but i can't help it."  not too long after, i found them all dry and silent. the yellow pages open to "travel"

      okay.  got that over with. this writing thing really takes a lot of work. those last three sentences really took the wind out of me. in fact that last sentence damn near killed me. this one's much shorter, though. much shorter. better. whew! though, not nearly so bad as the one coming up. not this one, however. nor this one. wait for it. wait. for.  it.

      what is one to do with all this white space? one feels a certain obligation to slather words all over it. "slather" i like that word.  almost as much as i like the word "cotillion." i'm rather fond of "poltroon" and "milksop" as well, now that you mention it. "quail" is utterly underutilized sad to say. it's a fine word. as are "purloin" and "filch."
