      I've decided to stay off tomorrow and on Friday.  I went in today and there were like 100 people there out of about 1000.  It was seriosuly the most boring day ever.    Has anyone been watching Big Brother?  I hope it's Vanessa who gets chucked out.  She is  so  full of herself.

      Only 3 days until the summer holidays start for us up in Scotland, (some parts anyway)! School is pretty boring this week though for obvious reasons.  Everyone seems to think that yesterday was the last day before the summer holidays, lol.  The most I had in my class today was... about 7 people which sucked.  All the classes sucked so badly!  Anyway tomorrow should be even worse :P  Listening To : Wonderboy by Tenacious D

      Ugghh!  Back to school tomorrow.  Another week of absolute shit.  Including, yep you guessed it, more french!  Including a test which I haven't revised for at all so that should be interesting lol.  I mean don't get me wrong not all of school is as boring as french...actually wait.....it is.  I went into town today and realised how different London is.  I had went to London a few weeks ago and what a change!  I mean theres obviously going to be a change but this was huge.  It was packed and everyone was everywhere and then when I went into town today it felt like it was empty.  Even though I really liked London I wouldn't want to live there (couldn't afford it either lol!) because of how packed it is.  Listening To - Find The Colour by Feeder

      Hey again, sorry for posting so regularly ;o.  I'm real annoyed with my computer 'cos it's so slow and it just won't run. Zone Alarm is messing it up, to cordless mouse is screwed up, and so is blogger, god dammit. An athsmatic (sp) ant carrying very heavy shopping could go faster.  Well, farewell for now. Take care!

      Today was the worst day this week.  It's the most boring day at school, I get all the shit subjects including French which I absolutely HATE.  The teachers all "yes Mark but you could do better" which really annoys me.  He never actually tells anyone they have done good work when they have.  He's the crappest teacher I have.  Anyway back to the rest of the day..lemme think....uggh I've got my paper round to do tonight which I can't be bothered to do at all. It's not like I get good pay for it either...

      The BBC is full of talent....*cough*suuuurrreee*cough*.  Anyways hello and welcome to my milestone seond post :P  It's absolutely pouring it down here but thats not any different from every other day here in Scotland, lol. It always rains here :(  Is anybody else out there listening to the Killers?  I downloaded a few of their songs (Mr Brightside, Smile Like You Mean It & Somebody Told Me) and I love them!  They're not like all the usual "rock" bands that you see around these days.  For one they can actually sing, lol.

      The BBC is awful, dude. How can you call anything that comes off that 'talent'?  The closest you get to talent are Shane Richie and Chris Parker (I like those two) There's always fat Kat who eats Alfie's breakfast, the greedy moose.  Anyway, back on to my daily post.  My first quote of this week will be:   Shut up you weird, pathetic people  - Maurice Chavez, GTA Vice City  My first song reccomendation is:  Metallica - Fade to black   That about wraps up my second post.  Bye for now!
