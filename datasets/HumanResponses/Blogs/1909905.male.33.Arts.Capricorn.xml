      June 6th, we're going to be working on the instrumental tracks to Organic B, and Organic C.  For those who don't know, these are part of the "unkept:organic" series of acoustic worship recordings for simple or house church worship use.  Organic "A" has been a great success and we're excited about taking the quality up a level and recording some newer original songs that haven't yet been put on tape.   To go with the concept, Peter Schrock (our graphic designer/photographer at Unkept) came up with the idea of having an artful photograph of an organic fruit or vegetable on the cover of each project.  Instead of #1, #2, #3 albums - we have "A", "B", "C" and so on.  Organic "A" is known as the Apple album for its wonderfully  captured green apple.  (to view:  http://www.unkeptrecords.com/store.html/)  The fruit for unkept:organic "B" is still up for grabs, but some options are the "Banana" album, "Berry" album, or "Beet" album.  Despite the way some evil people might twist Banana into some sort of offensive phalic reference, I DO like the possiblity of this fruit  being on the cover.  Towards that end, I've begun to compose a new song that could serve as the title track and bring more cohesion to the theme.  Admittedly, it needs some work but I thought I'd share it with you.  I'm open to comments and constructive feedback.  Remember though, this is an artist putting himself out there - I'm naked, and vulnerable.  Please be honest yet kind.  Thanks!  HOLY BANANA verse1 "Oh Lord, make my life long  Like a banana from Mexico May my pages yellow as I grow old in your Light Make my life "a peeling" to others I don't want to slip on the discarded skin of the evil one I want to be a fruit for You" (I'm not sure about this line)  chorus "We are Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy Whole big bunch of bananas Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy Big, big bunch of bananas"  Thoughts???

      You know, somedays you just wake up sad.  I'm not talking about tears in the eyes and hyperventilation.  I mean a low-level, underlying, subtle sadness that colors the rest of one's thoughts.  So subtle, in fact, that it takes some real attentiveness to the soul to detect it.  Though I can think of at least one particular thing to which it may be related, it may be the culmination of personal and non-personal information that combine to create a sort of heavy feeling.  I have a friend (a couple actually) that say they are deeply empathetic to the feelings of those with whom they are in contact.  One friend mentioned that it can be burdensome, literally.  To resonate with the pain of others, though technically catagorized as a "gift", more often resembles a "curse".  I don't know if I have this "gift".  But, today I do.

      Natalie says I'm a nerd.  I, on the other hand, am rather impressed by the fact that I'm attempting to enhance my personal knowledge and abilities in the area of computer hoo ha.  She and I are switching Macs because the one she bought for her previous job is currently sitting at home not being used except for occasional coffee shop web surfing.  This means I'm "zeroing out" her Mac and reloading the appropriate software to maximize its performance and personalize it to my uses.  I'm doing the same for the smaller laptop for her.  I take a strange joy in this computer reorganization.  It's sort of like have a messy desk, not just the desktop, but also the drawers; papers out of place, stacks on unneeded materials, and basic disorganization.  Though it is time consuming, it appeals to my deep inner desire to have things in there place.  Typically, my personality comes across - I'm told - as one who doesn't care too much about those kinds of things.  I am very adaptable and willing to live with things in disorder for quite sometime.  Ultimately, what I've come to realize is that it is really just a lot of patience for disorder with the hope in the potential of future organization.  Perhaps this is too much personal analysis but I have to explain it to her somehow.  If she understands, maybe I can sit on my couch reading my new VQS book on HTML and CSS programming without too many deprecating names being tossed my way.  ;-)

      During intermission, Greg asked me what I thought of the music.    Well, I am a Mozart fan, but probably not as much of a fan as I am of some of the Romantic period composers like Brahms or Chopin.  Though Mozart's music is complex in melody, harmony, and rhythm, it can sometimes become boring and seem pedantic after hearing large portions of it in one sitting.  I'm probably the pedantic one, nevertheless, I've been seeking more specific reasons for my vague "boredom" with Mozart when taken in, hours at a time.  I've determined that for me, it comes down to harmony and melodic endings.  Though Mozart's music often has complex harmonic shifts sometimes coming at unexpected times, his melodies hardly ever fail to land back on the "root" or "one" of the diatonic scale.  In case you are not familiar with these musical terms, what I am talking about can be illustrated by humming a tune we all know, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star".  Though this melody was written by Beethoven it does the same thing that much of Mozart music does melodically.    Hum the tune, noticing the starting note - the "Twink..." note, if you will.  This is the "root" note or "one" of the major scale from which this melody is written.  After singing the entire song, we return back to the same note on the last word, "are."  Some may say this melodic turn sounds comfortable and resolved, however others (myself included) might feel that it can sound trite, too final, or simplistic.  I am in no way trying to belittle the amazing musical gifts of either of these composers before whom my own musical composition skills seem like rudimentary abilities.  What I am trying to communicate is that living in the year 2004 and having the privilege of experiencing all the music that followed Mozart including all the romantic composers, the impressionistic composers (Ravel, Debussy), Traditional Jazz through modern Jazz, and even modern avant garde orchestral music, the "ears" of today's musician - if well listened - are used to less "settled" harmonies and melodic turns.  The more complex harmonies of Chopin's piano music foreshadowed the extended harmonies of contemporary jazz in its richness and disonance.  Strangely, as one listens to more disonant music, the music comes to sound less disonant and more familiar.  Perhaps this is why after the first two acts of "Le Nozze di Figaro" I was longing for some unresolved music, just as the plot at the end of act II was lacking in resolution.  But, what I told Greg was..."I like it."

      Two nights ago my friend Greg and I went to the Los Angeles Opera to see "Le Nozze Di Figaro" otherwise known as "The Marriage of Figaro".  It was written by Mozart between the years of 1786 and 1790.  Not to oversimplifiy, but the plot consists of Figaro and Susanna, servants to the Count and Countess Almaviva, making preparations on the morning of their wedding.  The Count secretly has designs on gaining Susanna's love and therefore is desperate to postpone the wedding.  The Countess finds out about her husband's "designs" and plots with Susanna (who's not interested in the Count's advances) to trap the Count.  Several humorous situations result - some quite comic, actually!  I never thought that I would LOL at an Opera.    The highlights of this production include the performance of Erwin Schrott as Figaro.  His baritone was amazing, his facial expressions comical, and his overall stage presence was captivating.  Isabel Bayrakdarian played Susanna and she was also amazingly captivating both in beauty and voice.  The set design was incredible including removable walls with rich colors and intricate chandeliers which were hung, a new one for each act.  The elaborate scenery was outdone by the final firework display which ended the show as three of the couples on stage were joyfully ready to be joined in holy matrimony.  There is more to say about the company (Greg and friends) and the night in gereral but if I say it now I'll be late picking up Natalie at work to join some friends at PBC (Pasadena Brewing Co.) and she's cranky when she has to wait for her beer.  ;-)  More later!

      This evening, I'm doing something I've never done before.  I'm going to the Opera.  My friend Greg Muger has a friend who is a full-time member of the L.A. Opera Company.  Tonight at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion they'll be performing "Le Nozze di Figaro".  Actually, tonight is a full dress rehearsal and Greg tells me we'll get a special "backstage" tour during the intermission.  I'll give a full run down of the experience later...right now, I've got to go iron my tux.

      Last Sunday I lead worship at St. Matthias Episcopal Church of Whittier.  The experience was very fun and much different than any worship leading I've done until now.  The "band" was myself playing a Yamaha baby grand (beautiful!), Charlie playing acoustic guitar, Brian Hill and Susan Callow singing.  We lead 8 songs, though they were dispersed throughout the service.  If you've never been to an Episcopal service you're missing out on some very active liturgy.  The word "liturgy" actually means "work of the people";  And that's exactly what it's like.  There is rarely a moment when the congregation is not singing, verbally responding, praying aloud, or saying a creed or written prayer.  Though most is written out and read, there are surprisingly spontaneous moments.  For instance, during the prayers, a Deacon read the formula prayer.  On certain items, however, the congregation is encouraged to say out loud the names of people for whom they are praying.  The Deacon may say:  "For all those in our community who are ill...".  As the Deacon pauses, attenders begin to say names to signify their prayers..."Mary Johnson"...."Troy Ball"..."Darryl cove".  The Rector of St. Matthias, Father Bruce Gray, is a friendly and warm personality.  He shared a brief sermon on the community of believers by sharing a story about his time last week with a young man who is soon to die of cancer.  Though not the typical evangelical message that was heavy on "teaching", it was rather inspiring and a wonderful expression of Christ loving others through us.  I chose songs that would fit the liturgy themes as best I could.  In place of the "Sanctus" which is a repeated "Holy, Holy, Holy" type heavenly worship song, we sang "Agnus Dei" by Michael W. Smith which has similar words.  After reciting the Lord's Prayer, we sang my song, "Bring Your Kingdom" which has for the chorus:    "Let Your Kingdom Come Let Your Will Be Done On Earth, as it is In Heaven, In Heaven"  During communion, Susan sang a lovely solo version of "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross", which I heard recently on Katheryn Scott's new Integrity release.  The words are the same but the melody is changed.  It took an older woman in the Whittier congregation coming up to me afterwards and saying, "How many more different songs can they put to that tune?"  Apparently, the melody is some old Irish melody to which many different lyrics have been set.  Speaking of the congregation, there were about 100 people there - most of them over 50 (I'm being generous with the age thing.  There were a few middle aged couples that looked like they would have been just as comfortable attending NewSong.  Oh, and there was a 22 year-old sitting inconspicuously in the back and wearing dark sunglasses.  Many people responded afterwards with comments like:  "That's was wonderful, will you come again?" and "Which of you is the song-writer? I wish we had the notes to learn the songs more quickly.  Won't you repeat some of them next time so that we can learn them?" or "Crank it up a notch next time! We want some more upbeat songs!"  Here's St. Matthias's web link if you want to know more about the church:  http://mysite.verizon.net/vzn060v9/id1.html

      Hello all!  In hopes that I might actually write more, I've shifted the web location of my blog.    They say that sometimes a change in scenery can get the creative juices flowing.  I don't know who "they" are but I hope they're right!

      Well, I found a location for our post-evangelical church.  It's in a tight little corner bar near Old Town Pasadena.  The idea is that we will get to use the small pub on Tuesday evenings provided we bring in some business.  The weekly gathering will be informal - almost so much so as to not be called an event - and will be open to all.  The bar will be open (but not free) and people will be able to have a beer or beverage and engage in dialogue with those present.  There will be scheduled "performances" including acoustic music  - mostly orignals played by various song-writer friends.  Also, anyone will be encourged during open mic time to read a passage from their favorite novel (not exceeding 5 pages), or to share an original poem or written work.  Non-believers will  be encouraged to participate, or rather WILL participate since no distinction will be made between "Christian" and "non-Christian" readers/sharers.  Much of the time will simply be discussion around tables, perhaps around what is heard and experienced on the small stage.  There will be a few rules and they will be posted as follows:  RULES OF THE HOUSE 1) People of all walks are welcome. 1) All views including religious, political, and otherwise will be tolerated and discussion of such presented ideas and views will be encouraged. 2) No person presenting a personal view (either up front or otherwise) shall speak in a way demeaning of others or provoking those who do not hold the same view with antagonistic and fighting words; This however does not exclude the passionate sharing and holding of certain views. 3) Drunkenness will not be tolerated. 4) The ancient virtues of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control will be promoted and encouraged.  I look forward to the opening of this new venture and look forward to how the Spirit of Jesus might use it to expose and promote His Kingdom in our community.

      Our friend Farnsworth McGillycuddy (a.k.a. Charlie Johnson) came over for dinner tonight and after much deliberation, he helped Natalie and I come up with at least ONE of the names for our new kittens.  That name is... urlLink LENNY .   One down; one to go!  Others names in the running but axed in the end were:  Curry Buddha Simon (Symee for short) Larry Cousin Earl Gin Tonic Charlie Manson (the kitten's a little rough we're discovering) Osama, and... ...Jim

      Two ladies talking about their babies.  One woman is American-Indian (as in Asia).  She wears an orange blouse with a zig-zag print and embroidered, white flowers.  It doesn't look traditionally Indian, but it has a relative quality.  Her hair is dark and short.  She has 3 gold earrings in her left ear.  Her nose is aquiline and hawk-like.  Her baby is a tiny newborn and acting drugged with open eyes.  The mother's skin is a beautiful mocha brown with pock-mark interruptions on her cheeks.  She holds the baby face-up in her lap with her hand behind its head.  The baby stares at her with a Buddha-like serenity;  eyes open, then closed, open, then closed, like tiny garage doors when the button is pushed repeatedly by a bored teenager.  She wears blue jeans that are so dark blue and starched it almost defeats the purpose of having denim.  Coffee People, NW 23rd, Portand, Oregon - 06-17-04 - 5:30 p.m.

      Call us crazy but we just got two kittens.   &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp They are wonderful cats with personality and character emerging every minute.  Problem is:  no names yet!  Take a look a them below and see if an appropriate name comes to mind.  Nattie and I would love your help!  Please register name suggestions by clicking on "comments" below.   P.S. The Siamese one is pure bred and quite shy, though very playful.  The grey and white one is playful as well and much more willing to hop up on your lap.

      “I am a whore I do confess/I put You on just like a wedding dress/And I run down the aisle/Run down the aisle/I'm a prodigal with no way home/I put You on just like a ring of gold/And I run down the aisle /Run down the aisle to You”   The lyrics are from the song "Wedding Dress" on Derek Webb's new solo album.  Webb was formerly with Caedmon's Call.  As you can imagine, several retailers had trouble with these lyrics, along with others on the album.  Another song includes the word "damned" in the context of being damned without God's salvation.  Derek actually agreed to edit the word from the final album after the prerelease was shunned by one particular, large retailer.  What was he thinking?  I know he's not commercially minded.  To compromise lyrics that were written from the heart to the Church seems to defeat the point of writing them in the first place.  After the "damned" controversy, the initial retailer agreed to stock their shelves.  It was a different retailer in the South that had a problem with the "whore" line in "Wedding Dress".  Thankfully, Webb maintained his artistic integrity (not to mention Biblical integrity) and refused to change the line which was inspired by the imagery in Ezekial 16.  If artists who are Christ followers are going to enter the world of secular poets and communicate with power, they must use the same tools that everyone else uses.  Or, at the very least, they must use the Bible - a book containing many words, including "damned" and "whore".  My suggestion to Derek is that he make the art that the Lord has put in his heart and then present it to whomever will listen.  If the Church won't, maybe others will.  It wouldn't be the first time.

      I started at the top of the hill, West of one river, South of another. A couple eating 10 a.m. sandwiches at a Jewish deli were engaged in a serious dialogue. Signs of this included the man with his right hand on his pickle and his left gently orbiting, but not quite touching, the woman's right hand. I went left and started down in the warm light; a welcome and yearly appearance by sun had been made. I ambled down at an angle, past the Bitter End bar, Ringside: The Steakhouse, and collections of private coffee spots.  There are many of these along the Portland cityscape.   I passed PGE park, the green grass and metal stands longing for a status change from amateur to professional.  The baseball would be different then; more prominent in the eyes of the nation, yet less of an authentic expression of America's favorite pastime.  Increased salaries mean altered motives.  Just below the park was a large site of construction. Though no workers were seen, the frantic sound of electric saws and frenetic pounding of an ensemble of hammers revealed a real estate tycoon behind it all, itching for increased riches. Confused Sir John bellowed from somewhere around the 10th floor..."Wait on me girl, cry in the night if it helps..I simply love you more than I love life itself."  No classic rock for these workmen.  Down, down, past the MAX train stop, over the tracks and past the crying woman who was pacing back and forth in front of what I supposed was her workplace.  On second thought, maybe she had exited her car because the torrential waterfall was relentless and though she was broken, she didn't care to die in a reckless car crash. She patted her red nose and paced. She was a bit overweight and not particularly attractive.  Maybe a man was behind the tears. Yes, a man.  That's how it goes.  I gamboled further, past the hairy homeless who asked for spare coins. "Sorry, bro - I can't today", I said.  "Thanks anyway, have a nice day." he replied, friendly as can be.  Did you ever notice that a polite rejection of the street request for money is rarely taken offensively? Next time, I'll look him in the eye.  I past the street police talking with a cadre of wanderers. I could sense his frustration, even across the street. How to deal with so many street people - many of whom have more material possessions than they have wits about them. I'll bet the officer struggles with his duty to "keep them moving" and his conscience to "find them help."  Homeless and Hopeless only differ by one letter.  Another minute and I'd be at my destination.  Before I could cross the street a young man with a denim shirt, white shorts, and expensive, non-baseball cap, inserted his clipboard into by periphral vision, "Would you like to see a Democrat in office again?".  "I'm not registered to vote."  "That's O.K." he said.  "Sorry", I said.  It reminded me the depth and breadth of activism in this town. Though I choose to aim my activism beyond politics, there is something admirable in the many volunteers who are seeking "gay rights" or some civil liberty cause. I wonder if Jesus was in the flesh on that corner this morning if he would have stopped to talk with the clipboard kid. Somehow, Jesus had a way of turning a deep longing even deeper and making a good cause an even better one.  Before I entered the Starbucks, I saw the professional flower woman. I call her "professional" not because she's paid for her sales of impromptu bouquets, but for her effortless selection of colors and textures from the fragrant bins at her feet. Even as she held a conversation about politics with the cyclist who had was sitting nearby, her hands never ceased to scan, select, combine, and trim flowers for the waiting patron behind her. I imagine her day is a endless succession of colors and conversations. I wonder if in elementary school, her potential future vocation test yielded "flower woman" as a possible career.

      For the last week, I've had a scene from the movie "The Day After Tomorrow" playing over in my head.  No, it's not the amazing snow blizzard scene that had Natalie and I shivering and forgetting we were in Southern California in June (that's effective film-making).  The scene in my head involves one of the librarians (I think) or otherwise 'smart guy' who is trapped in the New York Library with a few others who are attempting to ride out the horrific storm that is covering all of North America above the Bible belt.  This fan of Friedrich Nietzsche and atheist (we find out earlier in the movie) is sitting next to the blazing fire in one of the large library rooms, which the survivors have chosen as their refuge.  To the other librarian's chagrin, they are burning books to keep the fire going (after all, there is no shortage of this fuel where they are).  The athiest sits near the fire clutching for dear life an original copy of the Gutenburg Bible.  What a picture, eh?  It is interesting what this man says when asked about his fast affection for God's Word despite his lack of belief.  He says that while all of what man has developed and created may be slipping away into this new ice age, he is determined to salvage something of a testament to Man's progress.  To him, you see, the Bible represents the power of the word (notice the little 'w').  It represents man's ability to reason and communicate, think and enlighten.  To this man, the Bible is not God's Word, but Man's Word.  It is not a depository of God's revelation, but a token of Man's evolution.  It is strange, but I did not think of this man as only representing atheists.  Suddenly, I was struck with the correlation between this man and many Christians who see the Bible as some sort of textbook with all of the answers - answers which, with enough application of the 'scientific method', can be fully known.  That is, after all, what I was taught.    I'm beginning now, however, to see God's Word as His divine revelation, full of mystery as it is full of truth about our world and people.  Like the librarian, our Modern (in the Enlightenment sense) minds have reduced God's Word to a testament to man's ability to exegete and scientifically discern all the mysteries of the universe.  Instead, I'm more and more conviced that God's Word is partial revelation of Who He is and should be taken so.  Don't worry everybody.  It doesn't change what I believe about Jesus, the Trinity, the Virgin Birth, except for the belief that I only "know in part".  It does change the way that I approach the Word and what I expect to gain from it.  Most of all, I believe this approach positions me such that I have more awe and more respect for the ineffable nature of our God than I had previously.  If anything, I now read it with deeper curiosity and greater appreciation for the infinite part of our Creator that my finite mind cannot comprehend, even if He had tried to share it all with me.

      Yesterday I visited First Evangelical Church of Arcadia.  FECA is an English speaking, Chinese congregation just down the street from my house.  I met the pastor, Mongens Yu, when he attended the Fuller enrichment workshop I conducted earlier in May.  I've been excited about working with the existing leaders and worship team and my excitement only grew as Natalie, me, and Matt and Sarah (our house-mates) all experienced their service at the Middle School in downtown Arcadia.  The church meets in the Middle School auditorium.  It reminded me of the Mt. San Antonio College, Science Lecture Hall in which we used to hold NewSong services back in 1990-91; Little sound board in the back, musicians set up in front, blue plastic, folding theatre style seating, and flourescent lighting.  The overhead flourescent bulbs and their harsh rays were overcome by the soft and warm light emanating from pastor Mongens and the rest who had gathered.  Musical worship was heart-felt, and sincere, even as I began to imagine how I might help them grow.  Before the sermon, 2 younger church members gave their testimonies as they were to be baptized later that afternoon in front of the entire church.  The first testimony by a small, shy girl was tear inducing as she shared articulately, albeit nervously about her coming to faith and her family struggles.  It was emotionally moving as pastor Mongens called her whole family - mom, dad, and sister - to the front to be prayed for.  As the congregation was invited to stretch forth their hands as a symbol of joining in, Mongens invited the Holy Spirit to bless the family and especially the girl as she was publicly committing herself to servanthood and followership of Jesus.  After the testimonies, Mongens spoke the Word from Nehemiah 4.  Just as Nehemiah and the builders were ridiculed and criticized for their construction, we can often be wounded by words as we proceed to do God's work.  He contrasted wounding words and blessing words.  He encouraged the congregation to breathe life giving words to build one another up.  It made me think of a song I haven't sung in a long time...  "As the air fills my lungs As I slowly draw this breath As this oxygen brings life Inspire me to conquer death  Long before I breathe it out Before each vowel forms on my lips Before I sing, before I shout Let my heart be filled with only You And Your words  Lord, Inspire me Make my words like blows to death Inspire me Fill me with Your holy breath Inspire me As you fill the sails of ships Inspire me Only You can heal my lips Inspire me, Lord"  The service ended with the traditional benediction and the congregation singing the Doxology.  I could close my eyes and imagine myself as a child of 9 in small gymnasium where Rolling Hills Community Church met and where those words were sung as a happy ritual to end each gathering.  After the service I met several of the FECA musicians: Cindy, Glen, Elsa, Tracy, and others.  If not for other plans, we would have stayed for the Chinese buffet that is provided after every Sunday service.  It smelled incredible!  I look forward to contributing to the worship of this fine church.

      Man!  I haven't been this busy in a long time.  I'm now down in Anaheim for the  urlLink CRM  Director's Training Conference.  I'm leaving tomorrow, though, after only one day to head further South to begin celebrating the marriage of friends Peter and Jenn.  They actually will be wed on Friday afternoon.  It's at this rustic desert resort with horses, a pool, and cabins.  It sould be a blast and a uniquely exciting wedding.  They head to Nova Scotia for the "moon" and I get to hang with Natalie for a few days of vacation before she returns to Fuller and I head back to Anahelm for Internal SuperWeek (ISW).  We certainly have lots of funny names for things at CRM.  The I lead worship at St. Matthias on August 8th and head to Slovenia the following week to participate in the Eurasian Conference of CRM missionaries.  This should be fun since Tyler and I get to present our worship artist training materials to these leaders for the first time.  Our goal would be that some of them would be ready in the next few months to host the workshop for local worship leaders all over Europe and Asia.  Wooo Hooo!  That would be fun.  Got to get that support raised, though.  Right, Natalie?  After all - she's the one with the EU passport, not me.  I'm not looking forward to going to Slovenia without her.  ;-(

      In discussing the way that more often than not, Othello has been performed "in a cut text", editor of The Arden Shakespeare's Third Edition says:  "...the expurgation of Shakespeare's plays tells us much about the history of taste and about the history of misunderstanding Shakespeare, less about the strengths and weaknesses of the plays as we see them today."  Ironically, it is arguable that the cuts made through the years to plays like Othello, though done with the intention of somehow improving the play, have only served to lessen the author's intended impact on the audience.  I began thinking of this "cutting" concept in relation to the Text of the Bible.  First, the "Jefferson Bible" came to mind.  Thomas Jefferson thought the life of Jesus to be the most exemplary moral example.  However, living in the age of Enlightenment (and near the front end, in fact) he couldn't resolve the tension between the age in which he lived, and the original Gospel document's portrayal of the Supernatural.  His "Bible" which omitted miracles, including the Resurrection, successfully castrated the moral potency of the life of Jesus.  Nevertheless, it was a display of history;  the history of "taste" and the times surrounding the birth of our nation.    Another example of such castration can be seen in various Christian cults who nullify the Trinitarian concept found in Scripture.  Though not stated explicitly as such, the unity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is implicit throughout the New Testament.  To say "implicit" even seems to me to be a severe understatement.  Again, the extreme rationalism (though some still maintain the Supernatural, unlike Jefferson) which pervaded the times during which Mormonism and other splinters developed their doctrine, again spoke to, and in fact instructed that doctrine.  It was as if they stated, "The Trinitarian concept cannot be explained, therefore there must be another, more rational explanation for what is found in the text."  Both of these examples are specific, but there are less overt "cuts" in the text by evangelicals today.  We emphasize certain Scripture stories while deemphasizing others.  We dwell and harp on certain truths because of our rational inheritance, but we neglect other concepts and ideas - some which may be even more important to dwell upon.    Why, for instance, such an insistance and exclamatory presentation of evil abortion, while simultaneously, the same evangelicals are hardly heard to whisper about the environment and the evils done to this aspect of God's creation?  Both of these have Scriptures which announce their importance loudly.  Or, why such emphasis on sexual sin, such as homosexuality, while at the same time a din akin to rice krispies married with milk is heard relating to social ills and injustices?  I am not clamouring for a shift in which issues gain importance, but rather for equal time.  Abortion is evil.  So is the abortion of pine trees when done in the name of corporate greed.  Homosexual, physical relations are clearly not permitted according to Scripture (though I'm starting to question monagamous, civil unions which exclude sex), but neither is ignorance or inaction relating to the poor in wealth.  I propose, like the author of the introduction to Othello, that our history of chopping up the Bible for our own cultural purposes says more about the taste of the times in which those cuts occured, than it does about the strengths and weaknesses of the Canon.    We may impetuously exclude what we like from Scripture, either by infrequency or actual verse exclusion, but we must remember that the relevance of revelation remains only when we strive for an even reading of the text and equal time for all of God's concerns - whether apparently relevant to us as local individuals or not.    All the world is indeed a stage, and it IS a tragedy of Othellian proportions when the players (we) pick and choose which lines to recite and which ones to omit.

      My friend Greg is in Mozambique with a ministry team from Azusa Pacific University.  They are currently in rural Africa and on their blog, they described the church service they attended recently.  I was very interested by the description of worship and thought you might like it, too... :::::::::::::::::::::::: Church Here, worship isn’t just lead by one or two people. Once a song ends, someone from the congregation breaks out in a new song and everyone else falls in with them. Anyone can start a new song. There’s an accordion player stuck somewhere between the youth (up to 25-year-olds are called the youth here, so most of our team would be youth!) and the accordion would soon catch on, finding the right chord to accompany the singing.   As others had written, people dance here till the sweat rolls. Even the little kids dance. Africans really do have incredible rhythm and an amazing ability to harmonize!   Since this is a new church plant from “Mountain of Praise Church” (the ministry Pastor Rego and Mama Tanneken have founded), Pastor Rego first shared a little, just talking about some of the foundational stuff of their church. Then some women sang, and then the kids, and then other women again. Finally, Greg could preach and then Pastor Rego preached as well. Hence the 4 hours. :::::::::::::::::::::::::

      I just saw a show in which a man - assistant D.A. in Brooklyn -  was found dead in a car, strangled with a woman's leggings and left dead in an alley.  It appeared that a prostitute had killed him.  But that was a set-up.  What, in fact, happened was he was having an affair with another male lawyer in his office.  This other lawyer was married with two children.  Both had kept their homosexuality from everyone.    During their sexual encounter in the car, the A.D.A. had asked the lawyer to leave his family.  The lawyer couldn't bring himself to do it.  He still loved his family and he did not want to admit to the world that he'd been living a lie.  The converstion escalated into an argument.  One thing lead to another and in the heat of the moment, the lawyer killed the A.D.A. out of uncontrollable anger and his need to hide this shameful secret.  The lawyer ended up being suspected of this murder and was therefore incarcerated for interrogation.  While he was in jail, another headstrong D.A. - a woman - broke the H.I.V. confidentiality law and told the lawyer's wife that she should get tested for H.I.V. inferring that her husband was gay.  Initially, she was enraged at the suggestion about her husband, not to mention the assertion that he might have H.I.V. and have given it to her.  She was tested - and tested positive.  Her world was rocked.  Her husband had lied to her for years.  He also had been having sex with her, causing her infection with the virus.  Her two daughters were too young to grasp what their father had done, or who he was.  The pending trial (since he would not confess) was sure to smear not only the lawyer's reputation but also his family for sure.    The wife went to his jail cell.  She confronted him with the fact that she was H.I.V. positive.  She explained that she knew he was gay and that he had been lying to her for many years.  She also told him that she knew he murdered their friend Jeff.  Tearfully, she also expressed how terrified she was of having to tell their children news that she was not even sure she knew how to explain to such trusting, innocent children.  "But", she said.  "But...I forgive you."

      I love my wife. Today is our 3rd wedding anniversary and she's been on my mind since I awoke. When she turned 27, after we had dated for one year, I wrote a poem about her based on the meaning of her name.  Natalie means "God's Gift of Joy". It is an appropriate title for her in my life, since when I met her I was trying to navigate through the saddest part of my journey to date. She continues to be God's gift - especially of Joy - to me.   GOD'S GIFT OF JOY   Her loud laughter bubbles and gurgles and pours Over the sharp interruptions of life Glad, like a free and meandering stream That happily navigates sticks, rocks, and stones  She follows the flow Towards the whisper that calls Seduced by His gravity, meant for the falls She plunges Awakened to peace - not remorse  Leaping and bounding Slapping and sloshing Tumbling her way back to rest in the Source  It is here she will find who the Giver has been Joy is God's unique gift to sweet Natalie Lynn  ©2000 Eric Herron

      I love it!  It's like a discussion group on my blog comment log.  ;-)  Regarding the question, "What constitutes church?", I have two thoughts:  1) Church does not begin with a building. 2) Church does not begin with doing.  The first thought probably seems obvious to most evangelicals who have had this dialogue before.   Jesus said to the Samaritan woman:  "A time is coming and has now come when you will not worship on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem...true worshippers will worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth." (John 4)  He seemed to indicate that Place was no longer an essential part of the worship equation.  He placed the emphasis on How we worship, rather than Where.  Despite this clear statement, our human nature battles against Jesus' statement by making location a primary need, rather than somewhere else down the list of importance.  But, like I said, this isn't the point upon which most will get hung.  Most will readily agree that church can happen anyWHERE.  It is my second thought that might seem harder to swallow.  As someone mentioned in the comments,  church really is "the people of God" wherever they are.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German pastor and martyr at the hands of the Nazis, writes in his book "Life Together" that Christian community exists simply when Christians are together.  He mentions our preoccupation (again our silly human nature) with the need to catagorize our "experience" of Christian "community" by what HAPPENS when we gather.  His argument seems to be saying that, in one sense, we cannot avoid "having Christian community" if we are believers and we are SOMEwhere together.  It has nothing to do with WHAT we DO or exactly what takes place.  When believers are together, it is Church - alive and active.    But wait!  I said, "Active"!  That's doing, not being.  Well..it is true that Christians gathered "anywhere" and dedicated to "being" who they are in Christ will yield some kind of action.  Perhaps random kind acts.  Maybe prayer for another when a need is made known in casual conversation.  What if a passage from a "secular" novel is read, revealing a deep truth about the nature of our condition and it sparks some below the surface dialogue between those who believe and those who are skeptics?  The point is:  Doing is secondary.  Being is primary.  Location is necessary, but it is not specific.  These are a couple reasons why the scenario I described in the Old town Pub (though only wishful thinking at this point) could qualify as "church" in my mind.  Of course, some might say that church history, including the NT church experience as recounted in Acts should model for us what church is to be.  I think I disagree.  The history of the church and the sheer breadth and number of different expressions of the Christian church argues for cultural expression of church rather than set models upon which we must lean.  I read recently, one theologian who postulated that the Lord's Supper or Communion or the Eucharist might have only been meant for one time.  A visual/tangible lesson during a teachable moment between Jesus and his disciples.  Of course if this is the case,  it couldn't necessarily hurt to copy this action and make it into a ritual - especially one so full of meaning and so helpful to keeping us on track "until He comes".    Now, this is pretty radical, and I'm not ready to agree with this idea.  However, the thought leads to others regarding what other historical acts of the church may we have turned into lasting rituals or patterns for copying, when in fact they were simply the cultural expression of the church of the day.  After all, when I find myself or someone else saying it would be nice to return to the NT church, the thought sometimes creeps into my mind that maybe those things were good for the NT church, but not necessarily for the NM (new millennium) church.  Maybe "returning" to the church of Acts or Corinthians or Ephesians wouldn't be as dandy as we sometimes think it would.  They had a lot of issues.  My hope is that the church I am present with will understand points 1) and 2) and not feel bound to "cultural" forms, even when they appear in Scripture.
