      On this cold... Chilly night my power went out and so did my internet! >:0 grrr i hate it when it duz that, oh well this much needed rain will make a great mudding trip tomorrow! yeehaw! regardless im finnally getting back into the swing of things this summer. Basically trickeling outta vid. gamez and getting back into the real world. but its hard  finding stuff to do with my free time, with out wasting gas! seems like i just drive around all day long, and its getting costly! any ways spend your rainy night well folks and i found out what i can do in my free time, spend it with God!

      Amberly you are the greatest you have done so much, and i  have done so little. Im glad to know how much i've impacted your life and how you've grown to be the woman that you are; from childish acts to grown-up words of affection. you prove to me how ignorant i truly am, from the silly wrapping sign that you so kiddishly did to the little poems you write here and there with your artisitc abillity. Im truly honored that your respect me in this way. Eat your green beans and you'll grow strong and use ur charmin and you will feel great love! spend your times alone with God, not your worst memories . take the time to realize how truly fortunate you are! You most certainly would not be here if it'werent  for him so love, honor, and trust in him and you will be saved more than i could ever save you. Amberly you truly are one of a kind i thank him and you for being in my life. Lets grow strong together and worship in him together and carry on great friends.
