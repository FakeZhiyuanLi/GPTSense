      Let me tell you I almost fell off my chair when the phone rang and it was a familiar voice on the other end but only one I had ever heard on the mic in chat. Scarlett had told us she may be in the area this summer but wasn't sure when or if it was going to happen....For those that know Scar she is a nurse living in Hawaii..when she is on vacation she leaves that paradise to come to the mainland...what an odd concept lol..leave Hawaii for vacation lol ..doesnt that make ya wanna slap her ? You would think it would but if ya had the chance to meet her all u want to do is hug that special lady...and I did, NEENER NEENER  Anyway...she comes to the mainland to visit her family..ie; sisters and parents...she does alot of sight seeing with her sis and the kids and this time was no exception..when she called ( with the prompting of her sister who knew I was close to montreal) she says, Moon I am at the Olympic stadium... I just wanted to call you before we head out back to the states, I am with my sister and her family ...my first reaction is (in my best Anna voice) OH HEEEEELLLLLLLL NOOOOO!!!... its real easy to get here from there... I can order pizza for all for supper.. (my pizza place really loves me these days lol) and if Chris and I don't get to see u when u are this close I will never  forgive u girlfriend!...........So with that being settled I had to just wait for them to arrive lol Omg what a pleasure... they all arrive in 2 vehicles,,,,, sister Terri, hubby Tony, kids Kate 18, Joseph 12, Collin 11 and Brian 7...I think I got that all right lol....what a bunch of well raised kids and smart as can be aswell, was such a joy spending time with them all and ofcouse our buddy Scarlett..aka aunt Chell...I can't begin to tell you how fun it was to see her in person.  We all sat outside on my famous deck and the boys enjoyed playing with my dog and a blow up ball we had .....then the youngest Brian is walking around the yard looking at my Pergola and bench just pondering the place when he comes apon my bird bath...(simple large dish looking thing with one leg pedistal)....and we happen to be watching as he dips 2 fingers in the water and does the sign of the cross.........like u do in catholic church lmao.....omg I thought we were all going to piss ourselves it was just to cute and funny for words...but I bet my birds are blessed now lololol  Needless to say, the family had planned to go home but with some carefully constructed logic, that driving at night was a bad thing, 4 kids saying common dad we can leave early in the morning and my assuring them I had room for all and it was my pleasure....the ever thinking Collin saying to me, I sure hope we stay but I dont want to put u our..wher I replied ....thats so sweet Collin and I will make u a deal...I will put u in the least comfortable bed ok, where apon he laughed and said OK............I think the cherry on the top of the decision sunday was...Mom taking DAd to the grocery store for a few things they meant to take back home from Canada...(as SHE carefully spelled out THIS IS WHATS GONNA HAPPEN AND WHY SCENARIO)...and they all lived happily ever after sleeping at moonies for one night lol.  The rest of the evening was spend in greatly interesting discussions...lots of laughter, getting to know eachother somewhat..and watching 4 kids try to communicate somehow with my daughter  Cleo and her trying to do the same in her limited broken english with them. They sure came up with some inovative ideas such as using french english dictionaries....e-mail to e-mail sending using a translater...Collin talking real loud but real slow in Cleo's face and Kate telling him SHE ISN'T DEAF!!! and Cleo  bursting outloud  in laughter  totally understanding that part ...or just running back and forth asking Chris or myself how do u say this and that lol...I think they really got a kick out of the experience...I know my daughter did.  Then to the wee hours of the morning...Scar and I just gabbed and laughed till we had tears rolling down our cheeks like 2 girlfriends who had done it before, known eachother eons like it was a common occurance..what fun we had!!!...who knows given our distance when we can do that again but I will always charish it and I am also very thankful to have met such a nice family in her sister Terri and hubby Tony and kids..................we certainly hope to see them again sometime...besides they have advised us that we can bring the dog for a visit any time lol...........Well I guess I could call todays blog my SCARLETTE LETTER LOL....hope u enjoyed it , I sure did writing it...pics will follow when I have them to load..............

        OMG today was a long one...Chris went into work late so logic would dictate that he will be home late..like after midnight late ACK!!! I am so not used to being alone much anymore...and frankly my company kinda sux lol.. with my border still in camp, my daughter at her dad's the evening is the worse if Chris isnt here. So to pass some time I made my recipe for AMISH BREAD PUDDING...haven't made it in ages and I had planned to make it last week with all my company here but it just didnt happen. Chris hasn't tasted it yet so when he gets home he will have a treat.        &nbsp;   Speaking of treats...one of the great ideas we had last week among us ladies was for each of us to make a meal while they were here..( as Rae stated in one of her comments) ..man what a terrific idea, first night as u all read, I had pizza waiting ..but the next night I gave them a Lasagna supper with fresh garden salad and garlic bread...then next night we were out sight seeing and ate at a resturant..then Anna made a delicious chicken dish with an awesome rice dish, typically puerto rican is flavour&nbsp;&nbsp; omg yumm yumm ...next day was out again..then Rae made some deliriously good homemade macaroni and cheese, I don't know how many cheeses she put in there but man it was good..and we all got a huge ass steak to grill on the bbq to go with it..next night we were out..then last night Shan made a terrific and&nbsp;humungous meat loaf (or should I say mountain)&nbsp;we served with corn on the cob and I made my famous mashed potatoes that she loved so much at xmas when she came...so all that made for great meals by all and sure helped on the budget with everyone pitching in that way...besides the obvious joy in cooking for others and getting to taste things u might not have tasted before...I can't remember who's idea it was, but man, I really recomment it to others if they have lots of company coming, gives all a pleasure in helping out and in creating something and ofcourse sharing it among friends.        &nbsp;   Another great idea, yes I will regail u with more lol...was for all 4 of us to go through our old or new but never used makeup and mostly clothes, to then bring them all here to go through and see what fit who and who wanted what lol...It sure gave me a great incentive to purge my closet full of clothes I hadn't worn in forever... all that wasn't taken would all go to a woman's shelter. We all got something out of it , some more then others...Rae totally cleaned up and so did Anna's mom lol assuming ofcourse that her mom likes what Anna picked out for her..wich was mostly some things I had that were flowery that her mom likes in general, and some pieces that I made myself back in the day I couldnt afford to buy clothes......let me also add they all got a good laugh at some of these WELL CONSTRUCTED CONCOCTIONS!!! due to my um absolutely UNIQUE choice in fabrics...that I chose at a time when I didn't even know I was colour blind...believe it or not lol, or the mere fact that it was cheap materials may have led me astray as to its actual feasablility being used as a shorts and vest set...I believe Rae's actual words were..THATS THE FUCKING UGLIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN !!!!........omg we almost all pissed ourselves laughing at one point or another during this swap...I for one will never forget it lol, it was to funny for words sometimes...and to have done all that , have a&nbsp; terrific&nbsp; side aching laughter session with 3 great ladies ..and have a huge load of clothes to send to a shelter to help other women to boot...beats all else for sure...............antoher thing I recommend for sure if ever u get together with a few friends. .....Well thats all for today , my man just got home after doing an extra 2 hours overtime and I passed some time on here waiting&nbsp;for him by&nbsp;reliving some great moments from last week. You should see the big smile I have on my face lol....talk to u later..............xoxoxox

        Ok so my company is all gone, its Monday and Chris is back at work, although he will be going from 9am to 7pm accounting for travel time...means he will be home in the evenings instead..for 2 weeks..I so prefer that...but when I say almost..means our border Martin is still in camp for next 2 weeks... a welcome break.       &nbsp;   Well let me tell u, it was so cool to have 6 friends here for a week, I certainly hope we struck a nice balance of some touristy things and just being lazy on the deck or watching movies..granted the Quebec trip was a long and tiring one but I think totally worth doing it for those here who will probably never go back or be that close to it...such a gorgeous city...and I am always happy to spend a day there.       &nbsp;   It's amazing how much more u learn about ppl when u meet and spend real time with them..different nuances u never see online or on cam...spontanious laughter..or wit..lets face it its hard to be that way with the mic or typing in a chat room lol......and seeing how cpls interact with eachother...I feel so lucky to have been able to host all 3 cpls at once as comfortable as I could, each in a private room, I&nbsp; hope they were all ok, ..poor rae had some probs atfirst with air mattress, but&nbsp; in putting the futon ontop.. I think she was alot better...sorry rae, shoulda done that right away.       &nbsp;   The weather gods were on my side... except for very first night all arrived..we ate inside only because it was already 11 pm, we knew they were all starving..so had the table all set and ready for them to barrel in and decompress from the slightly stressfull trip from Rae and Ryan's place...after a few wrong turns and a 6 hour trip turning into 10 hours...we were ready for them with big hugs and lots of pizza lol       &nbsp;   I seriously though I would be far more stressed having all these ppl in my house for a week..trying to keep it tidy and be the best host I could.....rather, I enjoyed it alot more then I thought only because it was less stressfull because everyone really made it easy..they were all very helpfull..all very easy to enjoy time with.. the atmosphere for me anyway was very relaxed ..I certainly hope they felt the same....and I have to say my Chris is such a wonderfull man..he was and is always by my side to help me with anything I need...I never had that in a partner before..I realize all the total differences still after 2 yrs exspecially when we do something new...eg; having 6 guests...in my former life, no matter how many ppl were at my house..I had to basically take care of everything with no help including preparing the house before hand...what a different life I live now..it was just as enjoyable getting the house all ready for them to arrive..extra cleaning..cooking..rearranging...with anticipation&nbsp;with someone right there with me&nbsp;doing it all and more....I LOVE U CHRIS&nbsp;       &nbsp;   I can safely say it wasn't an anticlimax..u know when u are so excited and when it happens u are sometimes dissappointed ...we both were very pleasantly...I don't want to say surprized..cause we knew most all that were coming..what I mean is pleasantly captivated..ya thats a good word.....by everyone that came be it for different reasons....we had a great week with everyone and man the day they left after being 8 adults in the house for a week..it was soooooo quiet lol...we didn't know what to do exactly so when in doubt...have a nap lol...so we did.       &nbsp;   WOW for a first blog I&nbsp; sure said alot lol...and I am far from done about this past week lol...but then I guess thats the purpose of a blog... its never done lol ...now let me see how I can put some pics on here......

      Ya that was easy... I have no idea how to post a pic lol, call me goober ..and impatient lol I am gonna ask Rae how its done cause its easier then reading everything and figuring out how to do it all myself and have that personal satifaction for succeeding ....that is how Chris is about most everything lol, gotta love him...I on the other hand is NOT ....if it can be made more efficient in my head by getting help I will lol.............so now, where is rae when I need her lol

       Ok  I totally gave into putting my pic in hot or not lol..a bunch of us all did it and frankly its been a hoot . At first I thought no way but I rethought about it and figured  why not? A few yrs ago I would never in a million years posted a pic of myself anywhere..my self esteem was nonexistant nor would I have been able to handle scrutany . Wow how things can change in a few years lol...I am not really concerned with how I rate, I know that I am a 10 in the eyes of those that count. I guess part of the reason for me was my age and bbw status that forged me forward with this silly, goofy, fun, forward endevour......I mean think about how in the past women of over 30 were considered old ...that has changed in the last yrs with actresses looking better and better in thier 40's and 50's and the old addage *Men get destinguished looking and women just get old* is  not true anymore....but lets also face the fact that we all can't afford a personal trainer and plastic surgery either lol..don't get me wrong I realize that not all have had that done and certainly natural beauty is alive and well ...I am referring to what we see plastered all over in media and the like , beauty is what rules the market and society .... I would lie if I said it doesn't count to me but I also feel that beauty starts on the inside and shows its way out. How many times have we had that special pleasure of meeting someone absolutely drop dead gorgeous untill they opened their mouth and u realized they were dumb as a puck.....their beauty evaporates before your eyes and they just become a stupid person be it male or female...(I am so sure some men would disagree with me lol)...we all have our own pride and I am no exception to that. So having said all that and not being what society considered the demographic of the NORMAL  I guess being rated 7.9 or 8 just proves to me that even at 41 yrs of age and not your average sized woman but a BBW (big beautiful women status for full figured ladies on the net) .....I still got it lol . I can enjoy this little extra gleam in my eye and spring in my step lol..and encourage all woman of all ages and stature to be proud and hold your head up high. We all have beauty and we can all have fun with it no matter how u do it....and no matter what any silly rating I get, I know I will grow old gracefully and with a gleam in my eye never the less ......

      Just hanging around...quietly relaxed. I look at my surroundings. It truelly amazes me how fast things flourish, grow, blossem into being yet if we were to watch it without blinking it would seem like an eternity. I breath in the oxygen, make myself blump. I drink in natures gift of water to let it keep me alive. Our life is so short and fleating so I enjoy all I can. To let the sun kiss my skin and warm me inside and out is to live with rich purpose and free delight. I hope to fulfill all that I can and be the best that is possible for what ever my chosen plan. For I am so proud to be here today because I am the very FIRST RIPE TOMATOE in Chris and Moonie's garden this year!!! .............................Anyone feel like a toasted tomatoe sandwish?

                                            WHEN WAS YOUR LAST PAP TEST?          It’s a Thursday like any other; but at 11:15 am, the phone rings. I notice on the display that it’s my sister-in-law Manon. I picked up and she immediately says, “When was your last pap test?”  “I don’t know probably 2 years ago,” I answered.  “Well make an appointment NOW!!” she says more desperately.  “Yeah, whatever,” I say.   “I’ll get around to it.”   “I have cancer,” she blurts out. “Quit kidding around, that’s not even funny Manon!” I retorted.  “I’m serious, it’s cervical cancer,” she says as her voice starts to wobble and she starts to cry. All I could say was “Oh my God!”  She goes on to tell me she’s at her aunt’s and she was having a hard time dealing with it at the moment, she’ll call me later.                                                                                                                                                                                    As I sat there stunned with the dial tone buzzing in my ear. I thought, this isn’t real. She’s in her 30’s.  She’s only a year older than me. This happens to other people like your neighbor’s niece or your milkman’s cousin and the people are much older. Her daughter’s only 11 and she’s my 10 year old daughter’s aunt for Pete’s sake! It’s a mistake. It can’t be. It’s way to close to home!       Manon has more energy than anyone I know, she’s always moving or running circles around everyone. For her, everything has to be in order. I often kid that if she let herself go it would be safely assumed that she’d ricochet of the walls. I get tired just watching her.                                                                           Manon is more than a sister in law. We hardly go a day without gabbing on the phone at least 2 or 3 times. She has no siblings so she loves to hear all about mine who live across the country. Over 13 years our friendship has survived more than a few major tests. We are the only two people on the planet that can truly relate with each other concerning the species we call our in-laws. She has no right to leave me alone to deal with them! She’s also one of the most unreliable people I know. Every time she borrows clothes, I don’t see them for months even after countless reminders!                                                                            The dreaded treatments have started. The chemo and radiation could bring a horse to its knees. You wouldn’t know it by Manon though. After the first day of diagnosis, she decided crying wasn’t going to help her or anyone else around her. She’s gained a peace and wisdom rare for her age to a point of being an inspiration to the doctors and nurses who treat her along with many other cancer victims she’s come to know, most of which are much older. They look forward to her constant humor, words of encouragement and support. I don’t know where she gets this strength. We’re all trying to be strong but she manages to make us stronger still.                                                                                                          The worse is over for now. The side affects from treatments are quite evident but she’s not complaining. In fact she’s really excited about going away with her daughter and husband for a well deserved vacation. One month after they had a great vacation together, her liver stops functioning. The cancer has spread. She’s admitted to the hospital and we all understand that she’s not coming back out. There’s nothing more they can do. All she says to the doctor and us is « I’m not afraid of dying, I’m afraid to suffer. I don’t enjoy pain! » We cry and she calmly tells us that it’s ok.                                                              I was able to tell her, while I still could that I loved her dearly and how happy I was to be part of her life. I also thanked her for showing me what strength, dignity and courage are.                                          I spent what I know now to be the last 24 hours of her life, at her bed side.  She died quietly.  I had always done her hair threw the years so I combed her hair for the last time before calling loved ones.               When I kneeled in front of her casket with tears flowing down my cheeks, I also had to smile. She looked beautiful and at peace. The irony is that she was wearing an outfit that I’d lent her many months before. I would swear I could hear her whisper with a laugh, “Try getting this one back! “                                                     I think if she had anything left to say, it would be, “When was your last pap test?”                                                                                                                                                                  by  Monette Bouvier            September 9 /2000               I wrote this story in 2000 right after my best friend/sister in law died....I have been meaning to share it with you. If anything possitive came out of her death it was to really show me  how short life could be and it wasn't meant to live being miserable...hense my total change of life  within less then a yr after her death . Believe it or not but at 37 I had never had a driver's liscense lol so I began taking classes etc, I started preparing for the rest of my life...seeing a lawer, making arrangements with my now ex Michel for our joint custody of our daughter , coming to an amical parting of things and ways. We had been together for 14 yrs but having never married the legal stuff was about our daughter and our possessions , no divorse .I then had to  shopping for my own house to enable me to continue my job as a foster family etc....it was one of the hardest years of my life but it was also the easiest if u can figure that out. I came though all of that with my head held high, my self esteem renewed after so many yrs of not having any at all , but most of all I felt like a new and stronger woman ready for the rest of my life no matter what it held for me.  I knew I had done what had to be done and I had acomplished it in the best manner possible........All who know me also know how happy I have been with Chris in my life. I believe everything happens for a reason. I never would have thought I would meet a man like him or be treated the way he treats me..I wish it for everyone ................I still look up at times thinking of Manon with a smile and tell her...look at me now...bet I surprised you...but thanks for watching over me just to help along the way during those really hard parts...........            So, be happy to be alive...    we tend to not appreciate it  as we bitch and moan about everyday crap... I certainly do...that is why its nice to be reminded of things like this and the perspective of life at times .......HUGS ALL

          ARG!!! I am telling u this blog is not for the faint at heart, it aint purdy and it dont smell so good either lol...I have a finicky toilet...I swear it just likes to fill up with water for hardly any reason at all...seriously, I don't have small kids anymore that decide barbie want to go swimming . or lets see if this ball floats...nor does my border 33 yrs old, stick stuff in there, although mentally handicapped, he isn't THAT stupid....Nope, some days it just decides that u used one freakin square of ass wipe to much or god forbid u went all out and spurged on Charmin!!! I personally think it has a vendetta against ppl that scrunch rather then fold.....we are for the most part scrunchers, why do I know this? One reason is I know I did not raise a folder!! Another reason is cause I asked....I seriously believe folders are on a different astral plain then scrunchers...very odd indeed....PLEASE dont be offended if your a folder...we are talking about toilet paper here ppl!!! Besides I happen to know some very nice folders and we manage to co-exist im peace and harmony !            Anyway to get back to my toilet....it's just a pain in my ass, no pun intended!! I also know there is NOTHING wrong with it excepts its own demented pleasure in toying with my nerves....how do I know this??? WELL.....last yr when my dad was here, he too, noticed how this toilet was mocking us, and figured for sure there was something stuck in it or blocked some how soooooo...he and Chris decided to dismantle the thing, bring it out onto my deck and stick a hose in from all directions they could and *flushed her out...again, no pun intended...to finally come to the realization that it was just a badly designed toilet.....I happen to think the sight was such a funny one that I took a cpl pictures to remember it by, and one night late while looking at them, I in my infinate wisdom of nonsleep and cloudy brain, composed a touching poem in tribute to my dad and Chris that I shall share with u now.

         One must stop and ponder       every small moment of wonder.       Savour sounds and smells,       let them liquify into every cell.       Gurgle with laughter,       smile with glee,       like when my dad came to visit me.              I have to say,       it was a fine day.       Till he let it be known       he had plans for my throne.       I have to admit,       when I had to submit.       I felt like a redneck       seeing my toilet       on the back deck!              Dad and Chris       all flushed and determined       had embarked on a mission       to get to the bottom       of the mystery it held       in it's position.       They washed and shined,       rubbed and buffed,       cleaned and gleamed       till that was enough.       They poked and prodded,       emptied and filled.       All topsy and turvy,       untill finally they stilled.              As it came to be       the throne had always been free.       So I gurgled with laughter       and smiled with glee       as I pondered this moment       of wonder for me.       For after all was done       one must consider.       It's very very rare to have       such a clean SHITTER!       ......by Monette Bouvier sept /2003 due to lack of sleep
