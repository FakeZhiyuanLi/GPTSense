      I do not know how much updating I will be able to do this week because I'm helping out at a music camp from 8:30-12, going to school 1-6 and doing homework/ getting ready for camp in the evenings, maybe I'll try during my personal computing class again...   So how is everyone, what are you up to.  Shout out to those at LMC this week, Brady I hope you did well.  Congrats Stefi!  I think that guys should share the remote, coughBriancough instead of making their girlfriends fight them for it!  If someone calls shot gun, they sit in the front.  Poor Gracie had a panic attack at Six Flags today riding the Boomerang.  When I came home she was nearly drying because she couldn't ride the Superman because they were worried it would happen again  I talked to her like half an hour ago and she seems sort of out of it... but it is kind of late for her anyway.

      I just finished my Personal Computing Test and Now I'm off to the American History Test of Death! Wish me luck!  How is everyone else's summers going.  I don't think I said that right but whatever.  Hope you guys are having fun!  Don't forget Father's Day is Sunday.  Study Time!

      E-mail #1  Genre: Male Jokes   One day, Murphy and O'Brien went deer hunting in the woods. They sit in the woods for hours, when suddenly this humongous buck comes into view. With a nice clean shot, O'Brien bangs the buck. They drag it back to camp by the butt, but the antlers keep getting stuck. Another hunter says, "You guys should drag it by the antlers. It won't get stuck." They do, and Murphy yells, "Hey, he was right. He is not getting stuck." O'Brien replies, "Yeah, but we're getting farther away from camp."   E-mail#2  Jack has died. His lawyer is standing before the family and reads out Jack's last will and testament.  "To my dear wife Esther, I leave the house, 50 acres of land, and one million dollars. To my son Barry, I leave my big Lexus and the Jaguar. To my daughter Suzy, I leave my yacht and $250,000. And to my brother-in-law Jeff, who always insisted that health is better than wealth, I leave my sun lamp."  I'll see some of you at Peter Pan Mini Golf at 6:30.  Call me on my cell!

      LETTER TO A MOTHER      A mother enters her daughter's bedroom and sees a an envelope with  "Mom" written on it lying on the bed.  In great trepidation, she tears  open  the envelope and reads the enclosed letter, her heart in her shoes.      Dearest Mom:      I am so happy; I have eloped with my new boyfriend.   I have found real passion and he is so nice, with his piercing and special  tattoos, especially the one with my name in a heart.  I just love his  big motorcycle, but it's not only that, Mom, I'm sort of pregnant and  Yaqui  (that's Swahili for "Warrior Prince") said that we will be very happy in  his trailer in the woods.      He wants to have many more children with me and that's one of my  dreams.    I've learned that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone, so we'll be  growing it for ourselves and Yaqui's friends, who will swap for all the  cocaine  and ecstasy drugs we want.      In the meantime, we'll pray for the science to find the AIDS cure, for  Yaqui to get better.      Don't worry about me, Mom, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take  care of myself. Some day I'll visit for you to know your grandchildren.    Your daughter,    Melissa Louise     PS: Hey, Mom, don't freak, none of this is true. I'm at Judy's house.    I just wanted to show you there are lots worse things in life than the  report card in my desk drawer . . . Love you, Missy

      Yes!  Even though I do not know html, I managed!! hahaha.  I guess one day I'll have to learn it.  Now, I will be the master when I get pictures or a link to a picture page...See you later.  Oh write a comment, I want to see how that works.  Did anyone see the rainbow today? I was GORGEOUS!  Not only was it a double rainbow (most rainbows are double, one clear and one really faded) you could see BOTH sides at the SAME TIME!  It was great, a lot of my neighors were looking at it when I got home, fun fun, if I figure out the PICTURE thing, I'll post pics.  Well I have a personal computing test tomorrow, blah.  I have VBS in the morning and American History in the afternoon, double blah.  But then I'm going swing dancing with Brian, YAY!.  fun stuff.  Yes, we are together again (June First!) and no things aren't perfect but we're working on it.    I'm going shopping with my little sis on Friday hopefully, it'll be fun unless we get in to a little dispute.  Yeah, our shopping disputes get ugly and now that she has her own phone I can't make her stay with me when she gets mad because I'm such an uncool older sister.  I'm not very cool... not at cool as Stefi.   HARRY POTTER  Did anyone find that disappointing?  The hippograph (spelling?) thing was really cool.  Hermoine was a little player!  Brian thinks she and Harry should end up together at the end, but for now I think she did quite a bit of leaning on both, not that that's criminal or anything.  The two guys behind Stephanie and I were absolutely hilarious.  They made the most random comments and one guy kept snorting everytime he laughed.  No shame, no shame.     MEAN GIRLS  So cute!  I love it!  It's one of those chick flicks you drag some guy to and he survives it.  I liked it personally, but I don't think everyone will.  I think what you find funny depends on your personality, as is the case with a lot of humor   SHREK 2  Funny funny funny!  It reminded me of when Megan, Amelia and I went and sow the first one.  We were still laughing half an hour after the movie.  It's a good sequel targeting movies outside of Disney and stories outside of Fairy Tales.
