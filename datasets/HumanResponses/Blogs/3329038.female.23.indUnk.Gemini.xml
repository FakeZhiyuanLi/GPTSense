       I had a moment of stupidity today. I'm not sure why, but for some reason I started to get upset that I have been eating unhealthy food and not regularly exercising for the last few months. Stupid eh? I decided a long time ago that I wouldn't get upset like this. I absolutely hate it when girls bitch and moan about being fat, so why should it be any different when I do it? It's not. Thats why I don't usually do it.      Actually thinking about it now, I wasn't crying because I think I am fat, but more that I am just really, really disappointed in myself. I am disappointed because my body is the one thing in my life that should be completely within my control and it's not. I am the person that chooses what goes into my body and what I do with it, so it is my fault that it doesn't look as good as I'd like.    From now on I am going to be in control.

       You know how sometimes you get the urge to change things? Well that's where I'm at right now. I want to change a few things in my life. Not everything, in fact I couldn't be happier with how things are going in my life right now. But there are a few changes that I think I would like to make. Wouldn't it be great if after I finished writing this entry I could just click on the "apply changes and save" button?     I want to become more studious. I have been studying a lot lately and I would have to admit that I really enjoy it. I don't think that studying is a pain in the arse. The opposite actually. But anyway, I want to do more of it.    I think that I would like to be a snowboarder. Don't laugh! I'm not that great at it but that doesn't mean that I couldn't be.    I want to become more knowledgeable about world issues. This includes national issues to. I want to be able to have an opinion on international events keep up to date with what is going on.    I want to start experiencing more things in my life. This is a bit vague but I'm trying to say that I want to do more stuff.

      You know how after you have had an awesome weekend of boozing and eating you wake up on Monday morning feeling like crap? Well it happened to me this last Monday and once again I said to myself, ok Tiffany, this is the day that your healthy eating plan will start. This is the beginning of the new and healthy you that will exercise regulary and eat nutritious food.      Note how I did not say diet. This is not a diet. A diet is something that is temporary and is painful, not fun and is very hard. On the other hand a healthy eating plan is something that will bring positive changes into my life, is for the long term an will be a breeze.    This will be my fourth healthy eating plan.     The first one I did was weight watchers. A lot of people bash weight watchers but I managed to stick with it for 7 months and lost a lot of weight and learned how to make educated choices about a healthy life style. However, you start to crave wanting to be normal. To not have to think about points.  And the meetings start to piss you off. Well thats how it was with me anyway.    The second healthy eating plan was also very successful. It was a 12 week challenge at my gym where you paid a small fee to join, they take the before photos, give you the exercises to do, give you a diet to follow for 12 weeks and then take your photos again at the end of it. I did really well in this plan. I lost a lot of weight, learnt a lot and was a runner up winner. This plan made me love exercise. I went to the gym 6 times a week, often twice a day. Crazy girl. I also promised myself that I would not have any chocolate, coffee, weed or alcohol for the whole 12 weeks. This was hard but not that hard. But anway after the 12 weeks were over, I started to feel that I didn't need to go to the gym so often, and that maybe I could start eating a bit of chocolate and drinking a bit of alcohol and coffee and smoking a bit of pot. And thats how that one ended.    The third healthy eating plan was following The Body for Life plan. It started off really well but eventually cottage cheese and salmon and protein drinks made me want to spew if I even thought about them. And I really just don't like eating protein all the time.     So now for the fourth healthy eating plan I will mix and match the best from everything. I will exercise 5 days a week. I will try and increase the amount of protein that I eat and lower the amount of carbs that I eat. I will try to eat mainly foods that have a low G.I. And I will limit the amount of chocolate, alcohol and ganja that I have. But not coffee. I need the coffee for uni.    I'll let you know how I go. Oh, and I also will not be weighing myself. I have a very obsessive personality when it comes to my weight so I will avoid any psychological problems for myself by avoiding the scales to start with. Sounds like a good plan to me.

      I don't understand how I can be smart and stupid at the same time! But its true! I am both if that makes any sense!    Classic examples of my stupidness would include the following:  1. My low IQ - Its only 79.  2. My lack of short term memory - I'm worse than a goldfish  3. The other day Darin unscrewed the plumbing under the sink and said, don't use the tap. 5 seconds later I used it and all the water poured out over the floor. Then 1 minute later I did it again! Duh!  4. I forget what most movies are about 3 months after watching them.  5. Not only am I blonde but I am the Queen of blonde moments.    Then on then other hand I can be really smart.  1. I have an awesome grade point average.   2.Last semester I got an A on every piece of assessment, including a couple of A+'s.  3. I have come first in few of the papers that I am currently studying and received letters of recognition for them.    So I'm sitting here in a confused state wondering why on Earth I am planning on doing a double major in my this degree and then starting a law degree next year.    Am I stupid or smart? I think I might be too stupid to answer my own question but I'm also smart enough to know that there isn't an answer.

      Well its Sunday night and its the last day of the school holidays. Yet again I look back on these last couple of weeks and am wondering where all that time went and what an idiot I was to waste all that time. I promised myself that these holidays would be different, so at the start I made a list of all the things that I planned to do. It started off organised, but before you know it the holidays are over and I have only done one thing off the list which was to clean the house.     I do this every holidays. Maybe next time will be different. Probably not!!    It didn't help that I got really sick on this last weekend. Instead of going out and enjoying my last weekend of freedom I spent the whole weekend coughing and spluttering and wasting more time.    Oh well. We're going to the snow next weekend so that will make it up for it hopefully! Yay!

      Married at 20 with children at 22. This used to be how I envisioned my perfect life. I wanted a ring on my finger and young children grabbing at my legs and scribbling on my wallpaper. Ideally it would have been 3 or 4 children, two of them being a set of identical twin girls.  Next month I will be 23 and that life I used to imagine for myself could not be further away. Thank God! When I look at parents with babies, especially parents close to my age, they make me so glad that life did not turn out the way I had wanted to! The thought of having children to look after scares the shit out of me. I used to be so clucky too! Becky and Hannah would always make fun of how badly I wanted a baby. I even bought pairs of pink booties! At one stage I remember being so obsessed with having a baby that I cried and got really, really depressed when my period came. It's funny because now I would be so completely depressed if I found out I was pregnant.  I had a genuine scare earlier this year when I thought I was pregnant and it was awful. My period was two weeks late and I was petrified. I remember it taking so much courage to actually go and buy a test from the supermarket. I kept picking one up, walking around the store with it in the basket, and then dumping it before I went through the checkout. I don't know why it was such a big deal because I was in so much agony from not knowing. In the end I bought it and yay for me, I wasn't pregnant!  I often wonder now why I was so obesessed with getting married and having babies so young and the only reason I can think of is that there just wasn't anything else in my life that I had to look forward to at that time. I mean I never planned to go to university or go travelling or have a career. I just wanted to start my life and get on with it.  But now its the other way round. Babies would screw up everything I have planned. I want to finish my business degree then complete a law degree and then travel and work overseas. Sometimes I wonder if I will have time to have children at all. Time seems to be catching up on me now, but that could be because I don't really think about my life after the age of 35. I wonder why? I certainly plan on being around until I'm old.

      Today Darin, Melissa, Robbie and I went bungy jumping off the harbour bridge. Fuckin freaky shit man! I was so unbelievably scared. I didn't think that I would be, but when you're walking the plank it's a totally different story! I literally froze up and ended up just holding the bungy man's ass and could not let go! He was hot so thats ok, but a bit skinny for me personally! He ended up pushing me over the edge which was just as well because I'm not sure that I would have gone through with it otherwise. Fuck it was scary. When I was falling I started seeing those silver snail trails in my vision. After that it was great! Flying through the air with nothing beneath me but water. I had this quite weird sensation of calmness and serenity while I was bouncing around upside down. When I stopped being scared for a couple of seconds and started to think about what was happening I had this overwhelming appreciation for the absolute quietness and the complete isolation under there. Then came a massive wedgie and I was back to normal again!

      I just apent 20 minutes losing my blog virginity by writing my first ever blog entry and then it didn't save. Fuck that! I completely opened up to my blog and wrote about stuff that I have never even discussed before, not even with Darin and now its gone. Maybe its better that way. Maybe my blog was telling me that the world is not ready to know my true identity. I think my blog has secret powers. Wow.  And now I can't even rewrite what I wrote because it would just be weird. And it would never be the same. Or as good.  Imagine if this doesn't save and I have to rewrite it again. I will be a blog slut in no time.  I have to go to work tonight and quite frankly I think that sucks balls. Actually I love my job. Well at the moment I do. I used to hated it but now its fun. I hope the shit goes down tonight. I love it when things fuck up. Its great. I hope there is some cool people on tonight.

      Today was handback day but like a spaz I missed it. Darin missed his yesterday too, so we are both spazs. I thought it was 10 to 12 but turns out it was 8 to 10. I got one exam back though. I wasn't too happy with it initially because I studied for 5 fucken weeks for that exam! I only got a B when I was hoping for an A. The markers report said that I was still in the top 11% of all students, but even then I'm pretty disappointed. Maybe I got A's in the other two exams.   I just re-read what I wrote and it might seem like I'm this hard out student or something, but trust me, that is not the case! The reason I missed handback was because I got way too stoned last night and slept in. We've got some wicked weed at the moment, real trippy shit. Last week Darin and I bought this book to draw in when we get wasted, so last night we drew a volcano. It was pretty damned cool I thought, but Darin's half was way better than mine.   So...this is like my first ever blog. I was a blog virgin up until about 3 minutes ago. Although I love reading other peoples blogs and leaving them fucked up messages. www.teenopendiary.com is great for reading stupid teenagers blogs. I love reading about their fights with their parents, the stupid diets they are on, which ones are pregnant, who hates who and who fucked who in the weekend. Trust me, its good reading!Except the ones who just write poems about how they want to kill themselves or about breaking up with their bf/gf that they only met three days ago anyway.   Talking about stupid diets, I am supposed to be on a diet at the moment. Not a stupid diet, just a plain old regular diet. I'm not even calling it a diet, its doesn't have a name, I am just eating healthy food and going to the gym more often. Its better that way.   Not that I'm new to the concept of stupid diets. I am probably the Queen of stupid diets. I once went on a water diet, which involved me drinking so much water that I felt so full that I wouldn't be hungry. Worked for about three days or so. Done carrot diets too. Oh and just the plain old starving yourself for ages. I was never really good at that though. 5 days was my record for not eating anything at all. Done some other stupid shit too but I don't know if a blog is really the right place to discuss it. I don't do that anymore though. Not since the WEEKEND OF CHANGE. I promised myself that I wouldn't and I haven't. Never again.

       This is the start of my 12 week training programme to get fit for the 10k run that I am going to do on October 31st.     And I'm really excited about it!    My motivation for this 12 week challenge is not to lose weight, but instead the focus will be on improving my fitness and endurance and preparing myself for the run. Of course if I lose some weight on the side then that's cool too. Although I won't really know because I am not going to weigh myself.    This is my training plan for week 1.    Monday: 20 minute run treadmill.  Tuesday: Pump class.  Wednesday: 20 minute run on treadmill.  Thursday: Pump class.  Friday: 20 minute run on treadmill.  Saturday: 30 minute "real" run.    I'm also watching what I eat, but the real problem is that it is my birthday on Friday so that day is going to be a bit of a write off. See next blog entry for my birthday plans! But I figure I can work round it!    I'm really looking forward to this challenge and I am determined that on October 31st, I will be one fit bitch running a 10k run. Maybe next year I'll try for the marathon....
