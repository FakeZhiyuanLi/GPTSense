      So, as of late I've been a bad, bad blogger. This week was extremely intense at work and, as I have yet to find my camera or get the film developed, I have no knitting pictures. Puleeeze, you say - you can blog anyways! How very true. But I didn't, and for that I'm sorry. So the weekend is upon us, and here in Boston it is cold and rainy - ick! Yet, it makes great weather for putting in lots of time in the lab, which is about all I've been doing lately. The one thing about this past week that is super exciting to me is that I stuck with my "lofty" exercise goal all week. I went to the early morning aerobics class 4/5 days this week! Awesome! I'm so psyched for me :) I believe that if I do this on a regular basis (4/5 during the week and 1/2 on the weekends) then my body will get used to it and getting up at 5:15 every morning to get to the gym in time for a 6am class will start to feel like a part of my daily grind. True, this hasn't happened yet, but I can hope, no? As far as knitting, I got none done. Well, except for working on my square during my SnB meeting on Monday. A few of us who spend inordinate time and money at the Circles knitting salon in JP are knitting up 8"x8" squares to put together for a baby blanket for one of the store employees, who is, coincidentally, about to pop with said child. I have about 2.5 inches to go, but never found time during the week to work on it at all. The whole aerobics early in the morning things gets me in bed at about 9 each night, which is only about an hour after I get home, therefore no knitting time (not to mention, no laundry time, no cleaning time and no bill paying time... what an exciting weekend this will be :)  As my sarcastic, slightly grumpy attitude is starting to take over I will say goodbye for now, but promise to try to get on the wagon as soon as possible! Have a great Saturday! Cheers! Lissa

      Doesn't every Monday start off with some lofty goals that are *really* going to get done this week, even though you haven't done these same things for the past two or three weeks (no matter how motivated you were on Monday)? That's where I am this morning. I think it has something to do with the fact that I went to the gym this morning... at 6am! for an interval training class! This is exciting (not sickening) because, as of the moment, it is one of my lofty goals... to get into shape. Notice I did not say lose weight... I think there is way too much of a focus on weight in our society and I just want to be fit and toned in a way that's right for my body type. That itself is hard enough (I can almost see my triceps swinging in the wind from the effort of typing this blog:). I define getting fit as exercising in a way and at a pace that will allow me to run a 5K by the end of June and maybe a 10K sometime in the fall... definately qualifies as *lofty*. Another lofty goal is finding my g*&^%#n digital camera. Well, I didn't spend a lot of time looking this weekend, I was too distracted by working on my baby blanket and buying new yarn for a secret project. What I have decided is that I can't and don't want to put off posting knitting pictures any longer. I have some strange inkling that it is keeping my blog in the dark to have no pictures. The plan is, therefore, to take a disposable camera out today and take pictures of my WIPs, develop this film this afternoon and scan in the pictures later tonight or tomorrow. This will get the pictures up and let me figure out how long I've had this camera--there's bound to be funny pictures on it.  Yes, I did mention a secret knitting project earlier in the post. I bought yarn yesterday at Circles in JP (does anyone know how I link to a website using hypertext?) and it's beautiful. I promise pictures of the yarn as well.  So, today's tally: getting fit...check! work on knitting blog...check! kick butt in lab and get all experiments on my to do list started... well, I'll get there soon enough! Also, tonight is my SnB meeting. It's been a while since I've been to a Monday night meeting as I've been in and out of town a lot in the last few weeks. We meet at the Borders Cafe in Marlborough from 7-9ish. Usually it's just Bethe, Krista and I, but it seems that there may be new interest. Ahhh, new people, such fun! I'll take pictures of that too... Which means the pictures will be posted tomorrow. Fine. Sounds like a plan. Hope all is well out there. Cheers, happy Monday.

      It's been a long day... And will be even long with about an hour and a half of work left to do before I leave the lab and then Christine's belly dancing recital tonight (yep, that's right *belly dancing recital*). I've been keeping myself busy in the lab all day and during incubations scanning my daily knitblog reads for new entries. Several haven't changed all day and I was about to get bored and slightly annoyed when I realize that I haven't updated today either. Not that anyone is reading this besides me, but it's no good being a hypocrite.  I haven't told anyone about the blog yet. That will give me a week to try and post regularly and figure out snazzy tricks like putting up my daily knitblog links in the sidebar (anyone?). Plus, by then (if I do this) the blog won't look so empty and new. I'm hoping to use this blog to become a better person (haa, I first spelled 'bitter'). Not a **better** person with a halo and angels singing, but a better person that knows how to balance life and pursue what I love.  Ok, enough with the lofty goals you say. What about the knitting? Well, I have recently finished the Alien Illusion Scarf (and matching hat of my own design) from the Stitch 'n' Bitch book as well as the Ribbed for Her Pleasure Scarf from SnB as well. The alien scarf is already finding its way to the home of my best friend, Adrienne in CA as a gift for earning her MFA. Unfortunately, I forgot to take pictures before it headed off :( I can and will (soon, I promise, well at least as soon as I can find my digital camera!) post pictures of the scarf along with three hats knit from a pattern in "Knit It!" magazine that I have made as gifts for my brother. As far as WIPs, currently on the needles I have the Big Bad Baby Blanket and the Under the Hoodie sweater, both from SnB, going.  Pictures of the progress from these projects will also be coming soon. As you can tell I'm a huge SnB fan... Mainly because of the great illustrations and fun, funky patterns.  Well with promises of forthcoming pictures I'd better get busy finding my camera! Have a great weekend! Cheers!

      Hi everyone!  So, after many missteps and second guesses, I am finally getting this blog up and running. As I know nothing about computers (except email and word processing) I'll need all the help I can get. If you're feeling generous and know of something I can do to spiff up the place, don't hesitate to let me know! Basically I'm forming this blog to give me an outlet to share my passion for knitting with like-minded souls and to get their advice on how to balance that passion with the rest of life. Hence the title, "knit two together", trying to combine my not-so-secret knitting life with my career as a microbiology graduate student. Cheers! Here's to a good start and potential for the future!
