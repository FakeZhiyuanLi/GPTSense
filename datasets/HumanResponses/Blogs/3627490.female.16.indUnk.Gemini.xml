      yawn...it's late and yet i'm not sleepy...hmmm..wonder why.guess where i went today? went to the third Miyzuki anime red and white singing competition!!! I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ANDREA, AKA SKYE, CAN SING SO DAMN WELL!!!!!!!!!!well, i knew she could sing, but not THAT well, tomoyo was great as well, so was the emcees, well, just the girl. i still dislike Raywingz. he was positively dismal...guess what? i totally didn't expect to see farrah, sheril, and Mizuki (weird, i, until now, still don't know her real name.) and i met a jap girl through Hui ying!!! Momo!!!her japanese was freaking good!!!man...oh well.     you know...i kinda envy guo hao for his ability to whole heartedly fall in love with this girl....i wish i could fall in love...(and i mean, not a 5 second crush like i normally have.)sighz...maybe after O levels? i really have to lower my expectations.

      okay. i was exaggerating.i only accidently deleted 4 paragraphs.but its still a lot okay!! sigh.WHY are ppl migrating one time or another?  Ritwika- 80percent that after olevels,she's returning to either           Canada or India. Cheryl Ann- she almost went to Canada the other time,plus its not             100 percent she's staying in Singapore. Venisar- She may return to Sri Lanka after Olevels or Alevels.. Sarah ann-okay,just mentioning her,but its just to prove the point           that loads of ppl are going abroad. ME (lisa)- probably if i can't go JC,i'll have to return to New             Zealand,Australia,or Japan!NNOOOO!  okay.maybe its not everyone but...its still...plus im positive i missed out a few ppl!sigh.i DON"T want to go overseas.im sure the studying will be easier but....oh well.blog another time. oh yes.i nearly forgot.                ~i promise never to cry over a guy~  there. well,i had never cried over a guy so, this is just to make sure. see ya!!!
