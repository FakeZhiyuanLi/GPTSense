      Hello! We spent a fun day around the neighborhood. It was the annual neighborhood picnic. We did miss having Jarad here. He loves the big bounce house and all of his friends. We had a large smoker full of ribs, hamburgers and wings. There was even a big bon fire to end the night. Just a good day overall to sit and chat with the neighbors. I do believe the hit for Joli was the oatmeal cookies and the popcicles.

      Joli is finally understanding that you can ride a bike, not just push it.  urlLink

       Joli plays with her new bike, thanks Grandma Ebert!   urlLink       Happy   Birthday   Grandma!!!    Ok, so today besides being Friday the 13th, is also my Mom's birthday. I have a great story I am dying to tell about shopping at Kohl's Wednesday with her, but she is likely to kill me if I share it here. So all I will say is "I love you and Happy Birthday!" I talked to Jarad today and he is having a great time. He has made some new friends at the trailer next to him that shares his love of Pokeman. What more can a boy want? I had a great day with Joli. We started off going to the bank and were a little frustrated that the drive up windows were closed, so we lugged inside. Only to find out that it is customer service week at Bank One (with the drive through closed?... Go figure.) So we made our deposit and the teller talked me into filling out this new Disney charge application in which you earn money towards Disney Dream Rewards. It was a nice surprise to come home later and get a message on the machine telling us we won the drawing with that application and won a very large stuffed Mickey and Minnie. Not to bad of luck for Friday the 13th!!

      Joli is all smiles.  urlLink    I took these photos yesterday so I would have some new ones for you all to see. I did come across an older one that is too special not to share. Jarad left today to go camping with my Mom for a little over a week. Joli and I enjoyed some quiet around the house today and ran some errands. Joli and I will be visiting Jarad next week some time to spend the night. My Mom and Dad just got a new 5th wheel and there is so much room! We are looking forward to it. (Though truly, I don't think you could call it camping when the trailer has a huge kitchen, central vacuum and even a fireplace. More like a vacation home on wheels!) I just want to say thank you to everyone who made Joli's birthday special. She had a blast and received some great gifts. Everyone is so kind. Thanks again!

       OK, I am going to give this a try.  I really enjoy "checking" in on the Rescigno family, so I thought maybe we would give it a try.  (April, I hope you don't mind!)  It is really hard to keep in touch when so many of our friends and family are so  far away.  So please hang in there with me while I work this out.  I hope you enjoy.  --Jana

         She can stand  !   and prefers to stand instead of sit. This is Joli's new "trick". She likes to see how long she can stand (well over 15 min.) and when she finally falls she expects you and everyone else to clap. This will be a new treat for Jarad tomorrow. Today we went to a 1st birthday party for Samantha, she is the daughter of a college friend of mine, Jody and her husband Mike. It was a lot of fun. They had pinatas, games and even clowns. (We won't tell Jarad he missed it.) We only have one more week left until school starts. That means Jarad, Joli and I all head off to classes. The summer really seems short when you are not working!

       Two more days till Jarad comes home!   Yes, we are excited, can you tell? It is really quiet without him. I do talk to him a couple times a day if he isn't "to busy". (You know how the life of a 4 year can be!) He likes to play the guessing game at night. That is were I have to guess what pajamas he has on. We are also into the countdown of when kindergarten starts...August 30th. I am not really that torn up about it, I think because he has already been away at preschool and daycare. Today Joli and I made a tour of Genesee County so I could pick up some applications for substitute teaching. Everyone was really nice at each Administration Office, but I think it was because I had Joli with me. She got 2 job offers today. One to pick up papers off the floor and one just because she was "so darn cute." Joli and I are feeling much better, Scott on the otherhand (being a man) takes a little longer to heal. Ha Ha Ha. Tonight I headed out to Kohls and got Jarad a Spiderman backpack for school, he will think he is hot stuff! I can't wait for him to see it. Only 2 more days!

       Meet Macy   urlLink     Macy is one of my Mom's rescue dogs. She is a German wire hair pointer, I believe. This dog has the biggest heart and is super clumsy. I like to joke that when you talk to her, she looks at you like you are speaking a foreign language. My parents saved her because she was a handful and had been through a couple of owners. She even climbed a fence to escape from her previous owners. She is smart enough to stay at my parents though, because she is in doggie paradise. One of the silliest things is she thinks she is a parrot. She loves to sit on your shoulder when you are sitting down. She may be funny, but we love her. Just look at that face!

       Joli likes "see" food!   urlLink     These are some pictures I just got developed. Joli loves to ham it up for the camera and Jarad thinks she is silly. Today was one of those days that I could nothing seemed to go right. I am glad to see it is almost over... maybe tomorrow will be better. Scott, Joli and I all have colds right now, so you can imagine how fun that is. One good thing is at least Jarad is still camping so he is free of the "sick" house right now. Tonight we went to the Farmer's Market in Fenton and picked up some veggies. Then, we came home and gave Joli a bath with special vapor bubbles to help clear her nose a bit. Hopefully, we will all feel better soon.

I have a hard time waiting for portraits after they are taken.  So I sign up for the online thing and I still have to wait 2 weeks!  How unfair!

       Joli is in your chair Jarad!   urlLink     Well, Joli and I are back home and everyone is back on schedule. I took a final exam last night online and just completed my other final online about an hour ago! Have I mentioned I LOVE online classes? Next semester (Fall in about 2 weeks) I actually have to go to classes. This morning I went and got fingerprinted and record checked so I will be able to substitute teach. I just need to apply to a couple of districts and I should be all set. I snapped this photo this afternoon so Jarad can see what Joli does when he is away. The best thing is even though it is his chair, he will say "That is OK, she can use it." But if it was Scott or I that sat in it, that would be a different story. He has a special soft spot for her. (Don't we all!)

       Oh no! I got another tooth!   urlLink     Day 2 Camping   Boy, did we have a rough night. Joli fussed + Jarad had night terrors = Mom had no sleep. But that is what you get after a busy day. I bet everyone sleeps good tonight. Today Jarad beat me at air hockey and we hung out around camp. My Mom and I had to check out the Outlet Mall, you know how that is. Joli got her first pair of pink Converse high tops. Really cute! While we were there I noticed Joli got another tooth on the bottom. A total of 5, 2 on top and 3 on bottom. (Maybe that could have been the fussiness last night, because it is really rare for her to be anything but smiley and content.)

      Jarad say "Cheese!"  urlLink      Camping in Monroe   Jarad is having a blast camping. Swimming, playing at the playground, campfires and catching bugs. He is in heaven. Joli and I came to visit for the night. Scott dropped us off on his way to work. You can sure tell Joli missed Jarad for the past 5 days. She was grinning ear to ear when see seen him. Jarad was just in a hurry to show me his ladybug. My Dad and I took the kids swimming. Jarad swam until his legs were "frozen" and he couldn't move them anymore. Joli is all fish when it comes to water. She hasn't a timid or fearful bone in her body. Look out Olympics because here come the Forgach kids!

       Well, no outstanding news today.  Scott mowed the lawn and I did laundry!  We have been watching Joli like hawks.  She is about ready to take those first few steps by herself.  I am sure she has been doing it every time we turn our backs!  As Jarad would say, "She is a stinker!"  Joli and I have packed our bag because we are going stay with Jarad for the night tomorrow.  We should have a great time.
