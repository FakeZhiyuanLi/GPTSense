      The weekend was great. Sat we celebrated Nicole's Graduation at Sam Woo's (check carlene's blog for pictures) then headed back to the house for more socializing and drinking.  Sunday juss had a chill day, went to hooka with Carlene, ate In-and-Out and rented Mooseport (that movie with Ray Ramano)pretty good movie.  So today we're headed to watch the game and have B.B.Q. with some new friends we made Sat (Paolo and Janelle). They both do archery and thats something Carlene and I have always wanted to try so I'mma take a shot at it when we head there in about 15 mins...Look out Orlando =P  Oh and today is Game 5 of the Lakers and Wolves... 3-2 Lakers, hmmmm I wonder how this is gonna go down. I can't lie a little part of me is routing for the under dogs but I can't be too open bout that or I'll be shot here in LA...enven though they ain't in the runnings I have to say it..."go raptors"...k YAY LAKERS WOOOOOOOO!!

      The time now is 3:11 pm and I'm still at work but I just had to blog about the good news! Kay, heres the run down:  Carlene has been looking for an internship in the field of Graphic Design so that she can gain some early on experience before entering fully into her career.  So she had contacted a few places and this one place, I believe they're called "Creative Imagination"; had called her in for an interview. They we're looking to hire someone for a "paid" internship ...That's right paid baby! So this was the perfect opportunity for Carlene to get the experience under her belt AND get paid for it. She was a little nervous and wasn't sure if she'd get it but....  SHE GOT IT!!! UN HUH! *does a funky victory dance*  Yep she just called me and I almost went into tears, thats how happy I am for her... that and she can help pay rent now hehehehe jk! No really I am so proud of her, she truly is an awesome designer.. she thinks I tell her that just cuzz I'm her bf but it's true. I don't know anyone else who takes time to really think outside the box. I mean her design and concepts go far beyond her instructors expectations and being that I am in the same industry I can honestly say that we need more designers like her.  CONGRATULATIONS BABY! I'm sooo proud of you! Let's celebrate tonight, dinner and a movie on me k? Love ya!

       urlLink    "WHATCHU MEAN SHE'S SCARED!?!?"&nbsp;  This picture was taken when Carlene and I decided to have ourselves a lil' picnic. Yep we had the picnic basket, blanket and everything. We went to this park her mom used to take her and her sister when they were young.  It was nice to kick back, relax and watch our Penelope (our dog) frolic around in her american flag dress Carlene's mom got her from the Philippines. I know she's spoiled but can you really say no to that face? I mean really...

      I know I know...you're probably thinking, isn't Sonny doing the whole living healthy thing? I am it's just that this weekend I slipped. Well maybe not the entire weekend, lets break it down:  Friday: - went over to Carlene's in Chino Hills - watched Shrek 2 (kick ass movie) - snacked on some candies and junk food (it begins)  Saturday: - help clean up the house - wash the cars - made BBQ steak for dinner (not bad but it was late)  Sunday: - Connected and networked Carlene's mom and sister's computers to the web - Watched the Laker game - Bought and ate Bravo Burger (all hell broke loose)  Yep it was a pretty sad site. If you could only see the carnage this food caused. I mean we juss lay on the floor and couldn't move. Looked like somone dropped a bomb and we were the after-math.  So tonight it's time to hit the gym and burn off those weekend calories. Other than that I feel good and work right now isn't crazy hectic so I'm glad.  Pictures coming up soon...

      If you were to look at my life right now, thats what some might say. In some aspects, my life is just that...boring. I hate to say it but I have become soooo routine.  Everyday I... • wake up • exercise • go to work • come home • Q.T. with Carlene • sleep  And it just repeats. I know once something becomes routine sooner or later it becomes boring and I fear that is what I am becoming. Partially because, and I think this could be one of the many reasons... I don't have a lot of my own set of friends here, sad but true and it's partially my own fault.  It'll be a year next month since I moved from Canada to sunny California and I must admit it's hard to make friends outside of Carlene's group of friends. I figure it was easier back in the day because I was still in school and it was just easier to meet people on a daily basis who were in your age group and had similar interests. Now that I'm done school and working the making friends thing is a little harder.  I can't use the whole..." I just moved here from Canada" bit because 1 yr is more than enough time to adjust. I need to get out more, join groups or something and I'm gonna start doing just that this weekend. Well tonight I'm heading back to Carlene's place in Chino and we might hit up a grad party, then tommorow nite is her friend's b-day so we'll do that but on Sunday I'm free to go back to Costa Mesa and figure out what there is to do. What groups are there to join around my apartment. I wanna stay away from the Club and Bar scene, I am so over that part of my life....but what else is there to do? Thats my new task, to try to make my life NOT routine and to find new and interesting things to do and if I happen to make some friends along the way bonus...  On a good note....NO MORE MOHAWK!!!! Thats right, mohawk just for one day. I couldn't take it no more so yesterday after work I went to go get it fixed. It's really short right now but it's better than what I had before...WAAAAAAY better =)  I'll start adding pix and updatiing you guys bout my new adventures real soon...

      It's been a while since I had a decent hair-cut and as of late it looks like I've been in desparate need of one. Now if your anything like me I'm picky with who cuts my hair and i takes a long time to actually find a barber/salon who can cut my hair without me having to worry about wearing a hat or calling in sick the next day.  I had that comfort zone with a particular salon back in Canada and they've been cutting my hair for over 7 yrs. But now I moved to Cali, things have changes and I have to start from scratch. Son in my search I've had to deal with "Super Cuts" and "Fantastic Sams" and even a place called "Hair Cutters". They all were decent cuts but not really to my liking.  My search lead me to what was near my apartment which I have just moved into recently so I'm still getting familiar with the area. And what do you know, there's a Paul Mitchell Salon just round' the corner from my apartment. Carlene had taken the liberty of making an appointment for me @ 8pm last nite. I was happy that it would only cost me $10, sweetness...but did I mention it was a Paul Mitchell SCHOOL!?  Yep I had agreed to get my hair cut done by a student with full knowledge my hair is no easy task, with 3 collics in my head, weird shape and on top of that my hair cut before was masacred by a little asian lady who cut my hair wearing over-sized latex gloves....At first I thought wow she must be very hygenic but not too smart wearing gloves that are too big while cutting peoples hair with sharp tools! Then I saw posters on the wall with her in a doctors uniform and the big gloves toting a pair of sheerss with the headline saying : "Who's gonna operate on your head today?"  Fear and disbelief filled my mind and sure enuff she messed up my head...But all thats ok now since I'm going to The Paul Mitchell School to get it fixed right? Well I get in at 8 and I wait for say 15 mins. The place is packed, I guess a lot of people were wiling to get their heads done so I wasn't so worried at that moment. Then I hear my name called out and this guy Justin comes out, a punk-ish into the import car scene kinda guy. Nice guy but.....in the two hours it took for him to cut my hair he managed to butcher my head all the while I'm thinking 'it's gonna get better, it's gonna get better, I don't have my glasses on so it must look ok, it's gonna get better".....  2 hrs later and I walk out with a wack ass MOHAWK!!!!!!! k it's not too bad but a mohawk??....I don't think I'll be heading back to that slaughter house anytime soon. Maybe it's because I go my hair cut done by a phase one student, I should have got it done by a phase two for $5 more...Dammit. Oh well hair is hair and it'll grow back rite? *forced smile*  I think I'll head to a salon after work to get it fixed.....*ponders the thought*  To be continued....

      "...and now I hit publish...dammit..."  yep that kick ass blog entry I thought I had published durring my lunch break today somehow didn't go through...poop on a stick.  Maybe if I feel like it I'll re-cap what happened today later tonight, but the question of the moment is...Where is Carlene??.... she's at school =(  I got home from work and she's not here, I can't call her cell cuzz she left it at her moms....Now I know what Carlene means when she's says it sucks to be at the apartment alone....well I'll juss sit here and read some books till she gets back.  Tonight is movie night so when she gets back we'll walk to Hollywood Video ....=)

      Ok...Since I lost my Clie (PDA), I know sucks ass!!!! I need to find an alternate way to give myself reminders of things to do or specific dates. So, being that I'm on the computer all day at work I might as well use my blogger for this purpose, well until I buy a new PDA oh and get Carlene one too. (I know she really wants one even though she swears by her traditional pocket organizer)  Having my own apartment is pretty cool, there's just a few things I need to get like cable...Well I can live without cable since I don't watch alot of TV plus it gets me to do other things like read books! I'm currently reading 2 books: 'Marketing Plan' by Don Debelak and 'The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership' by John C. Maxwell. I'm really diggin' both books from what little I read so far, both will help me in my future plans in terms of where I'd like my career path to go.  Well thats all for tonight, gonna watch a movie Carlene and I rented "Girl With The Pearl Earing".  K here's da list for 05/13/04:  - email Carlene with the response email I got from one of the graphic designers - 11am meeting with kustomerkinetics - finish outlining and color correct AJ's bags to upload to the web - make the changes for the Berkley site and upload b4 the end of the day  - work on NYX header cards and display boards

      Early 90's music blasting in the office??? OH HELL YEAH!! The other day Rudy and I started talking about music and 90's music entered our convo. Names like C&C Music Factory and PM Dawn popped up.  We even found out each others obsession with Milli Vanilli. Rudy went as far as to getting his hair braided, I on the other hand had made a home music video lip syncing to 'Girl you know it's true' with a Mop head fastened to my noggin. Yea I know....dork, but you find me one person at that time when no one knew they were fakes who didn't like them....you liked them, yeah....you did.  So anywayz, that convo sparked me to download a bunch of song's from the early 90's. I even got this one mix that's 1 hr long....awwwwwwwwww g'yeah!!!!!!!!!! Let's get this party started right....let's get this party started quickly!

      Well it's been a really long time since I have attempted to blog, and the truth is I was just gettin lazy and was just finding it hard to make time for it. But then tonight Carlene had told me how blogspot had a new setup for their blog sites...Comments now? Shut Up!  So we both got on the site and signed me up. This is good...getting back to blogging since my family is in Canada and I talk to them like once every 2 weeks, it gives them an outlet to see how I'm doing on a daily basis.  So with that here's the run down  to get you guys up to speed with whats happening in my life:  - I'm still with my wonderful gf Carlene - I moved into an apartment in Costa Mesa - got a kick ass bed set and mattress for choice price with help from Carlene - still with that Marketing Advertising Agency KMG and things are going well - going back to Canada June 23rd for a week to visit family and friends - Oh and did I mention I turned a quarter century last month yay  Thats all I can think of right now, I'll post some pictures up and blog in more detail soon...I miss my puppy =(

      (The Scenario) On my way to work, driving on the 5 fwy and I start to have an un-easy feeling. Can't quite explain it but something inside me felt weird. No it wasn't the food or the hooka I had last night with Carlene, Jill and Sarah (That was fun btw, Jill and Sarah are welcome anytime at the Apt.), it was something else.  So I arrive at the office on time and punch in. Lorraine (my co-worker) arrives soon after. I begin the usual "Good morning" and proceed with small talk. The topic of the last episode of 24 came up and she was telling me about bombs attached to some guys arm and having to chop it off with an axe, more bombs and terrorists ish....  *ring, ring*  All eyes on the office phone...I pick it up.  Me - "Good morning, Kurianski Media Group" Caller - *muffled*  "What suite are you?" Me - "Pardon me? You'll have to speak louder, it's very difficult to hear you..."  *now un-muffled I can hear him clearly this time with a middle eastern accent*  Caller -  "What suite are you? I am outside RIGHT NOW!"  *After talking bout 24 with bombs and terrorists, my mind starts running and I must admit I was a little thrown off*  Me - "um...who do you want to see or what is this concerning?" Caller - "I am outside! Tell me where you are!"  --  Turns out he's this dude who's supposed to pick up a CD with files he's paying for. So in the end he wasn't some guy who wanted to bomb my place of work. He just wanted a CD and gave me $60 for it.  I knew it all along... ;)

      The time now is 11:08 am. As I have said earlier the company I work for  urlLink KMG , has just moved to  a new building and so today a guy named "Gus" from ADT is installing the system.  Seems like a normal day so far untill I walk past him while he's on the ladder... Not before, not after I pass him but while I am right beside him...he lets one RIP!!!! *FART* Oops he's says with a childish grin. Man right at that moment I was filled with so many mixed emotions, I didn't know weither to say gross out loud, gag and say "excuse me I'mma go shower now".  Yep this day seems interesting already...

      I know I know... I promised to update more frequently and I'm not. It's just that ever since I got back from Canada it's been hectic here in sunny Cali. Work especially has been a whirl-wind of over-time to catch up on jobs and to complete new ones, oh and did I mention we moved to a new building!?  So on top of all that work we had to deal with the move durring the week. Now that we're here at the new building we still got to paint the walls cuzz you know to be a Marketing/Advertising/Design Firm we can't just have plain white walls, we need some splashes of color to get our creative juices flowing =) We're also removing the grey carpet and putting down hardwood.  I have taken some pictures of our move and the new location so I will post that up a little later. Also I got pix from rafting, not the pix you've seen already on Carlene's or Nicole's site but ACTION shots supa coooool hahaha.  Ne wayz I will post that all real soon but for now I gotta get back to work, just wanted to post to make sure that the one or two of the people that do read my daily ramblings besides Carlene and her sis know that I am posting and that this site is not static...er stagnet...or whatever you wanna call it... I posted dammit! THERE!   -- peas
