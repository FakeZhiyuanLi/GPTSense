      The sun blazed on as if it were the Carboniferous era again and all plant life was meant to grow gigantic.  Remember gigantic?   equisetum  horsetails once had trunks with tinkertoy treetops.  The bark was a gunmetal sheen of soil extracted silicates.  The flow of water from deep roots kept turgid branches reaching.  Weeping stands dropped cones that felt like coconut husks.  Spores clouded parching sunsets.  Carbon dioxide kept its warm blanket on the sweaty Earth.  Horsetails grow in gardens, a noxious weed whose roots reach 30 feet under.  Brittle, they leave these deep threads when plucked by plucky weeders as reinforcements that can mole upwards in later months.

      So I wanted to trade.  There is an instrument called an Orcana that sounds "good."  Its   "not too big, not too small."  The Orcana is mythical and luscious, an instrument that is for quietly jamming.  A phone call to the trader is cryptic.  Here's my address, her slightly slurred drawl reads out a distant location, near the Greater Vancouver Zoo.  (That's where a elephant was carted off a few years ago to the States since its buddy died). There is a shroud of controversy around the GVZoo.  It is not regulated.  It has animals in chain linked enclosures with little shelter.  Something is rotten in the monkey hut.  Ophelia, a 200 pound Anaconda, lithe despite her heft, has gotten into the hennery.  Hens swallowed whole perchance to dream a life beyond chain linked exhibition, find solace first in constricted extinction and weep nutrient tears collectively as snake bolus.  (Fantastic digression into fantasy.) Anyways, this lady lives near the zoo, and this Orcana she's trading ("Good sound, not too big not too small") will not pass hands easily.  A lilac won't do.   "I have enough lilacs already" What she really wants is a monkey puzzle tree.  Monkey puzzles, aka Araucaria araucana, are strangely shaped evergreens, reaching 150 feet high in their native South  America.  The monkey puzzle resembles a hundred million spiky rosettes of miniature aloe vera plants carefully impaled on branched shishkabob sticks stuck to a Christmas  tree trunk left in an alley to age until Easter.  This flagrant conifer sports gigantic gonadic cones the size of basketballs that take 2-3 years to mature and enclose up to 200 edible seeds.  Apparently they taste good and are one of the staples in the diet of the Pehuenche peoples of Chile.  The aforementioned seeds cost $25 US or 25Euros to procure from a grower in Victoria.  The plants I have seen at the Van Dusen Gardens' last Seedy Saturday for $15, they were only ten or twenty centimeters high.   Orcana be a pipe dream as long as monkey puzzle trees are sparsely available. BuySellTrade...hmmm.

      Monkey tree's disappearance a puzzle  By Sandra Thomas-Staff writer  An East Side woman wants to know how thieves managed to steal a seven-year-old monkey puzzle tree from her front yard earlier this month and no one noticed.  Ellie Brede says she woke up one morning a few weeks ago to find a large hole where her much-loved tree once stood.  "I was so upset," she said. "It was so nice. I always wanted to live by a monkey puzzle tree."  The hole left behind by the thieves suggested the distinctive-looking tree had been pulled out by the roots rather than dug up. Brede replaced the 10-foot tall tree with a smaller one about two weeks ago but then this week woke to discover it also had been stolen.  "It's not very pleasant," she said. "If I get another one I guess I'll have to plant it in the back yard. My neighbour said other plants are being stolen in the neighbourhood, too."  Brede's neighbour Trudy Thompson noticed the second tree was missing and went over to tell her elderly neighbour. Thompson felt sick to her stomach by another possible theft and hoped the tree had merely been moved to the back yard.  "I hated to be the bearer of bad news, but I went next door to ask her about the tree," Thompson said. "She didn't even know it was gone yet and she was just devastated."  Thompson would like to replace the tree for Brede but said she can't afford to pay for it on her own-the wholesale price is about $100 a foot.  "They're not cheap little things," she said.  A call to the South Vancouver Community Policing office confirms plants are being stolen in Brede's neighbourhood.  Const. Mark Jarvie, neighbourhood policing officer for South Vancouver, said a woman came into the office this past week to report the theft of a large number of flowers and shrubs planted in the Blooming Boulevards project between East 53rd and East 57th. Blooming Boulevards is a joint city and parks board project to help improve their neighbourhoods.  "They lost quite a few overnight," he said. "We've also had reports from other people."  Jarvie couldn't guess where the plants end up after they're stolen, but said the most likely options are black market sales to corner stores or nurseries, which then re-sell them. The thieves could also be planting them in their own gardens.  "Last year we caught an elderly woman who was just going into yards and digging up the plants she wanted," he said. "It's hard to say. We even caught some young people just going into yards and cutting flowers. If anyone sees anything like this they should call 911 right away."

      This morning a bathroom break seemed in order, as descending rapidly in elevation from my mountain-top house to sealevel causes my bladder to convulse. As I tinkled merrily in the basement, humming a little ditty, I noticed the door was slowly creaking inward.... had I inadvertently left it ajar? The latch does not fully close, this I know, but would the drafts or passing trains cause enough change in air pressure to cause the door to move on its hinges? I did not stay too much longer to find out the reason for this strange architectural dynamism. I washed quickly and was up the stairs before the toilet water had finished gurgling its way seaward.  Did I mention that the train station parlour has a gigantic mirror? This mirror is so placed as to be visible when descending the stairs from the upstairs offices. I can only imagine the chill, if alone one autumn night at closing a cool, blue and unearthly face would to peer up at you in the reflection of the mirror. Perhaps the piano or gramaphone might start to play-all by themselves, and then the pump organ in the mailroom might wheeze in a dissonant chord with the cacophony. The lights might start to flicker, the telegraph might begin to tap: dash-dot-dot dot-dot dot, dash-dot-dot dot-dot dot, over and over and over again. (what's this message you say?  urlLink  -.. .. .    ) In a high and querelous voice you might sing out: "Who's there?" But the ghastly symphony would continue. You might glance around at the flickering lights, at the whirling gramaphone and at the piano rocking as the keys are being pounded with such force and fear the darkness in the corner under the stairs. With dread and terror you would look up at the face now cackling in the mirror... Transfixed by the demonic visage who, despite its insane, silent mirth still gazes into your eyes. You are compelled to descend the stairs. One foot carefully follows the other, you cannot break from the staring goblin. You begin to cross the floor toward the mirror. The sheet music flies from the piano and whirls around you in a wild vortex. The portrait of King George shatters, falling to the hardwood. The bust of Beethoven topples from its perch on the piano. You reach out your hand to touch the mirror, terrified beyond reason. You can feel the cool of the mirror as your finger draws closer, you perspire despite the chill in the room. Your pointer finger traces the air around the cheek of the grimacing apparition, you press your fingers to touch this strange lip...at once it whips its mouth toward your outstreached hand, so quickly you cannot draw back. Snap! The teeth close shut on your finger. You scream. The sharp inscisors cut flesh, sinew and bone. Blood spurts from your injury impossibly. The mirror, the wall, your face is splattered with red, red fluid. The whirling papers become spattered with blood. A fine mist of pink siphons from your broken hand, a tornado of horror. Your shrieking reaches the limits of your breath and body, and you can only wrack a gooey cough. And as suddenly as it began, the wind dissipates, the lights return to normal luminosity. All is silent in the museum. You glance at your throbbing finger to discover that you have cut it on shard of mirror. Strangely the mirror has shattered and broken like a bullet hole as if some force shot from your fingertip and pierced the glass. You could not study this phenomenon as you would have to tend to your rather badly sliced fingertip...     It could happen...

      And when the Strathcona Seniors came, I offered to do the Meet & Greet at the door.  And 47 Chinese seniors all pointed to my nose and made obscene gestures.  "Big" was what I heard.

      After you all left, someone twisted the kitchen door.  Just like that lady who was trapped in the bathroom this afternoon.  The wind could not have turned and shaked the door knob so much.  The noise was the same.  Twisty-turny loud.  Was I scared of the Gaunt Ghoul Basement Man?  No.  It was daylight and I had to be brave and protect little Ani≈üoara.  Is it in fact the Gaunt Ghoul Basement Man?  Did he migrate upstairs?  Or is it the dream of J., of the murdered Moore daughter?  My first meeting with the ghost.  This first encounter ensures that I will be henceforth haunted.  Dang.

      The museum has a train.  The train has a water closet (or for those unaccustomed to this usage: a toilet cubicle.)  The train was built in 1921 so sumptuously, even the WC is panelled with mahogany.  The little brass knobs and grates are a nice touch too.  Now, in the age of iron and rail, indisposed passengers performed their biological functions and stomped a footpedal that released the evidence out of the car and onto the tracks.  The train hurtled on, leaving foul trails to the disconcern wary rural villagers.  At present this system has been connected to the sewage network, as the train car is now permanently stabled.  Nomad no longer: freespirited spewing discontinued.    The drawback to any large artefact, is that its smallest components are in a continual, shuddering capitulation to entropy.  Like bodies, buildings and traincars suffer pathogenic infections, weak valves, leaky pipes, strange growths, rusty gears, gradual cooling furnaces and occasionally suffer critical breakdown.  The traincar requires painting and cleaning, and a few nails from time to time.    Today, the museum was awash with visitors, a group of 47 seniors, children and adults from the Strathcona Senior's Centre.  The tours were brief and translated into Cantonese, the garden and shade under the weeping willow were greatly appreciated.  The seniors were effusive with thanks, smiles and questions.  They all however, needed to use the toilet before leaving.  Most went to the basement washroom, but one old lady, about 70 years old, I suggested she use the WC in the train.  I showed her to the facility and returned to direct traffic to the basement washroom.  About two leaks time later I checked back in at the traincar WC. As I approached I could hear a great knocking and creaking as the WC door was assailed by the frantic efforts of the old lady.  The latch had evidently stuck and locked her in the closet.   Incidentally, this had happened on a previous tour a few weeks previous to a small boy whom I released crying into the arms of his daycare supervisor.  She asked him to be tough for her and he stopped whimpering.  She gave him a little hug.  Today, I could not console the incarcerated victim: I have no words of comfort in Cantonese.  I had finally a translator calm her and I  tried prying the door with scissors to no success.  I  cast about in our "complete" kitchen on board the train for a butter knife to no avail.  I returned again to try the scissors.  With the increasing panic, I finally was brought a knife.  In a second I had tripped the latch and released the flustered and embarassed heptagenarian.    There will never be a better reason to move the renegade filing cabinet from the men's washroom in the basement...or perhaps the ghost will lock people in there too.

      Yesterday's debacle, with its crashed computers and heat left this employee convinced of the haunting in the building.  Evidence?  1. The computer crash happened in the basement: the area of said haunting.  2. The crash appeared to have had no human input causality, thus must have been perpetrated by forces unknown or undetectable by man, woman or beast. (or perhaps we should get a beast in the basement to detect the presence of ectoplasmic putrefaescence-say a psychic hamster).  3.  When the furniture in the basement was moved the spirit struck back...ghosts don't like change.    Now to appease this spirit we must sacrifice an odd number of something... according to the acolytes.    Fetch me my sacrificial instrument!

      I finally broke my record of staying late in the Museum.  When the clock crawled to eleven thirty, I ran down the stairs.  There in the dark, I knew the ghosts were watching me.  Luckily I had emptied my bowels before coming in for Part II of the  Newsletter that Wouldn't Die .  Yes, this doesn't have to happen for another two months.  When the next newsletter comes around, I'll be ready.

      July 21, 2004  A Station  Today, at 2:00pm a tour of punk-assed kids will tour an old railcar at the Station Museum to humour their parents and daycare attendants.  They will ogle the sleeping berth, thinking that it would be a prime makeout spot to get to 2nd base and take the piss from the kitchen, which has nothing to do with the history of the train.  Inside they will ignore the telegraph, a tapping, tapping irritation that never ceases to type the same damn message: "Send reinforcements: Mordor's forces are at the gates!"  (or at least that's what I have translated).  Finally they'll reach the 1913 train bell and beat the shit out of it with xylophone mallets whilst proclaiming their musical supremacy at 600 decibels.

      The flies swarmed in the train like a Biblical warning to the pharoah.    Two weeks ago, we smelled something like garbage coming out of the ladies' power room (the toilet used by the last vestiges of suffragettes in the 1920s).  The cupboard under the sink revealed nothing.  It was odourless.    The smell tricked us.  It enticed us into the ladies' power room.  It probably wanted to slam the door shut behind us and trap us there.  But, being vapourous, it lacked the strength to push the door.  As soon as we were in the ladies' power room, it rushed out to stink up some other part of the train.  Now there are flies everywhere.  Stuck between the window panes, in a glass sarcophagus - like inmates on Alcatraz, they can see the wonders of the outside world from their prison, taunting them with bright lights and good times.  Something died in the train, in a place we cannot find.  The maggots grew up into flies and have grown bored with their corpse feast.  It's time for a little steaming dung to satiate their appetites.  A few flies escaped.  One even attacked the cleavage of a young Japanese lady.    "It's time to vacuum them," said the Boss Man.  "Not me," I said.  "Not me," said J.  So it fell upon the Boss Man to remove the carrion-eaters.  The flies between the two panes of glass stayed put.  The bathtub, meanwhile, could have passed as a murder scene.  Or a suicide.  Or a natural death while bubble-bathing.  It had the hard-to-remove stains of a decomposing corpse.    J. and I would need a scrubber.  The Boss Man told us there was one in the Haunted Broom Closet.  I accompanied J. down to the basement, we got a bucket and the scrubber.  Then we dragged a hose around the train, sprayed the tub with water while I rubbed off the first layer of dirt.  Underneath the black were rusty brown stains.  Evidence of old blood.    "I'll need some cleaning solution!" I demanded.    First I got some dish detergent, then paint thinnner, then a white powdery substance that required gloves.  An hour's labour turned the bathtub white again.  "It's good enough to bathe in!" said J.  If you don't mind laying in a coffin.

      For $60 party on.  The parking lot got full today.  Randy Raccoon out near the road attracting guests with his cocky conductor's hat and overalls.  Nary a soul approaches the cheerfully drab station (in need of a lick of paint).  Sixty bucks to JB in an envelope and she unlocks the Venosta.  "It's all yours."   Minutes later I peek out the window of the upper floor office.  Our Venosta is attended by a aproned party mom.  Platters and streamers, plates, pop, cookies, cupcakes, loot bags, hats and eventually, yes, screaming, leaping tikes fill the party train.    The large unwieldly easy chair is ensconced in the basement collections area.  It will only move by moving other items.  The chair is upstairs, and the stereo cabinet down after exertive dolly manoeuvres.    The heat was becoming unbearable.  Randy must've sweat buckets in his getup.  The party train reaches 30 degrees, easily.  Cupcake icing stays viscous through the miraculous marriage of chemistry and culinary industriousness (or is it industrial culinariousness?).  The many well-protected kid seats encased in steel shafted, four-wheel driving, glass and cash, six cd changing sport utility extravances melt in the greenhouse effected leather apholstered interiors. The philosophy of safety of soccer parenting, a doctrine of auto manufacturers' marketing branches, can be a relished irony: safe through steel and wheel, safe from the gradual tsunami of melting ice caps, sipping gradually melting iced caps as sea level laps at mud flaps. The hot brands heat atmosphere as soft bellies wince at the hot brand of seatbelt metal.  Today N turns four.  Average years more: 74.  The baking party train is stationary on the tracks that go nowhere but to fantasy.

      He was our second peddler of the day.  Our fingers were sticky with the remains of chocolate-covered almonds and he arrived.    "Let's see what goodies he brought!"    We ran down the stairs like children excited about their first pudding bath.  I jumped over the last step, taking care not to look above at the haunted mirror.  We zipped through the Mailroom and past the Telegraph Room.  We came to a halt in the Waiting Room.  Alas.  He only had a binder.  We thought he would unravel all his wares, so we could point and say "that one."  He told jokes that elicited the sort of laughter one laughs out of politeness, taking care not to laugh too hard, lest the joke-teller takes it as permission for an encore.    The Man from Puce Creek, noting our laughter, tried another one, to make up for the first.  I noticed a speck on the display case and, by the time I flicked off the speck, it was the point in time immediately after the punchline.  I joined in the feeble laughter not knowing at what I was laughing.  When he went to his car, I explained to the Boss Man that my job there was finished.  "Quick," urged J., "He's coming back!"  We both ran away as he walked up the walkway back.  In the end he gave us some free stuff.

      The Station staff are tired, many hours have been spent working on the various projects around the place and many nights have been sleepless due to the overriding fear of the ghoulies.  Exhaustion breeds paranoia and the paranormal.  Are humans more sensitive to abnormal presences when in a state of stress?  Is it the mind that "invents" stimuli to continue producing endorphins in order to stay awake?   Will the ghoulies in the basement make contact with the living again?  It is my scientific proposal that on a certain moonless night this month a Ouija board ( urlLink homemade? ) could be brought to the basement for communicating to the hidden spirit.  We should find out where its from, who it is and what it wants.  Also it is a good excuse to eat the chocolate cake that is sitting in the freezer, just waiting to be gobbled.

      Our first recorded death in the Museum took place this afternoon at 3:05 PM.  At 8:10 PM, I accidentally, rather brutally stabbed myself with a big knife while trying to open a bag of popcorn.  Enough blood to douse a paper towel with red polka dots seeped out of my finger.  I attribute this incident not to the 3:05 death, but rather to the noisy spirit - that gaunt shoulish basement man.
