						   Here I am, just a few days into my blogging career and I can already see myself losing focus on everything that is important. Sorry hun, "I've got to go do some research." Which in essence means I need to search active bloggers for like intelligence and interests. Hopefully I will completely lose interest in the bond market, lose my job, and be forced to blog professionally. Does anyone know if there are blog offs? Much like dance offs? They should make a movie and call it "You got blogged". Or as my buddies would prefer to say...stop being such an f-ing nerd.

						   Sweaty guys in sleeveless T-shirts. Girls are parading around in tank tops, belly's exposed (the good and the bad). The bartenders are ripping you off for a ten dollar red bull and vodka. However, the look from the cute blonde wearing the casual black pants, gucci sandals, and plain white blouse changed the entire scenery. It's amazing sometimes how a single glance can arouse you from the slumber encompassed in the bar ritual. No one spoke to each other. Just a simple smile. Besides, I'm involved right? Either way, the simple smile is what carries over to today and reminds me that yes I am the cute machine.

						   I started feeling my age yesterday. Amy Sullivan is bigger than I am. I remember the fall afternoon at tomahawks practice, the smell of crumbling leaves and barbeques in the distance. I was punishing Mike Sullivan for the fact that his parents actually had the sex to make the baby Sullivan. Now she is 15. Have I really passed 15 years like that? In a flash where everything has changed but still pretty much remains constant. Keith Poisella however, has never changed. Glancing through the old football and lacrosse programs confirms this fact. I've never seen anyone have the same haircut, same posture, and same attitude throughout their lives. Maybe he is a different breed of human. In fact, I know he is a different breed because his parents remain together and they themselves haven't approached any morphing...which is kind of impossible considering Mrs. Poisella must be going through menopause and we all know the ginseng, organic, soy induced stages of that transformation. I guees I'm glad then that I am a child of divorce...it forces me to keep changing.

						   Walking home today I had a recurring thought popping in my head. The sun, while tremendously loving and caring, can produce thoughts of guilt. For example, I left work after an awful day of trading with a full thurday of a sunny day. What did I choose to do? Walk aimlessly and consider a nap. I wish that I had access to an auto because if I did watch out, I would be cruising the coastline with Sublime blasting. Maybe that's just it...A car that's what I need.

						   I am a programmed machine running to the tune and rythmns of the universe. I follow the rythmn in my trades. I smoke a cigarette. I play ms. pac man on my cell phone. I think playing ms. pac man is like moving to the nature of god's choosing. If you count the dots on the ms. pac man board you will find they are in perfect bars and measures.

						   Walking around aimlessly in the city it seems that females have the annoying habit of cell phone munching. I really don't understand the whole idea. What's wrong? Walking around by yourself without your electronic device in hand makes you unpopular? Whatever happened to walking and observing? The mouth doesnt always have to move. And I know that no one is that important where a few moments of silence will break the new paradigm of productivity. Relax. Please.

						   Ronald Reagan died last week and all I can think about is barbeque. Yes the markets were closed today and what did I decide to do in honor of our 40th President? I decided to master the art of the Memphis Rib. People who don't understand barbeque are those people who would prefer to watch Barbara Walters interview Liza Minnelli about her first period. These same people would also probably habitually read US Weekly while working out on the treadmill. I on the other hand would prefer to molest a budweiser while scanning the contents of a charcoal grill. Alway charcoal, never gas mind you. If you are using gas then you are obviously too rich of a prick to enjoy a fine barbeque. The keys to the memphis ribs are as follow. 1)Marinate for hours 2) Use some kind of smoked wood chip for taste and 3)Let all other thoughts except for brain numbing drinking and basting enter your mind. In that sense barbequing is like therapy. A self medicating, meditating, and marinating kind of therapy. Mmmmm marinating therapy. Watch out Freud I'm going to barbeque you into oblivion.

						   Living in the world of the yuppie is like living in a transplanted society whose major goals are intense intoxication, golf outings, and sales at the Short Hills Mall. Girls chit chat about the latest Sephora trends while dining on a sushi sahimi menu and sipping on the latest australian chiraz. These people are like the kids who never had worry number one about anything. They were probably given their first car, lack any student loans, and more importantly never have the aching pain in the back that if they fuck up it could be on the street and into the shelter, or even worse back to mom's house. I saw one girl the other day walk her minature poodle down the street while talking on her earpiece cell phone while smoking a parliament. And it's always parliaments. I don't really know why I live in Hoboken, perhaps it is the cheaper rents and proximity to manhattan, more likely however is that I have become what I feared most in this life a yuppie scumbag following the crowd. Why can't I just pick up and go? To Ecuador, New Zealand, or San Diego. I know why, because I'm a big pussy that's why. Security and eveness have this attachment to me...I need escape...any suggestions?

						   I think that I will be working for the next fifty years. As I was walking through the train station today I came across some college aged kids obviously en route to their first job. I remember that initial angst of college retirement and workforce entry and to me it was one of the most damaging periods of my life. While dealing with this newfound problem I ran into one of my friends fathers and he told me, "Don't worry. You only have to work for the next forty years until you can return to your college freedoms." Now, after five years of the routine I look at those college kids and actually smile. Besides, I got four years on em.

						   The American people are disappointed. Even if you only have a faint interest in thoroughbred horseracing you were probably tuned in to the running of the Belmont Stakes. However, today, only a few hours before the running of the final leg of the triple crown, America lost one of it's greatest presidents. That statement is coming from a lifelong democrat/Bush hater. The reason I mention it is because such a sad day in American history cannot coincide with a Triple Crown winner gaining our hearts and happiness. You cannot be in mourning and also celebrating. The whole balance would blow. This day was meant to be a day of remembrance and sadness not a day of exhultation.

						   I don't think loyalty has anything to do with modern business. Instead, I think that the company you work for would rather use you as a tool. A basic chess piece in their bigger chess game of social status and recognition...and more importantly, a few extra bucks. Everyone in America sympathizes with some of these executives and their company gorging. People like this say, "Well, that's the american dream. Work hard, succeed and you will achieve economic power completely disproportionate to the actual value you add to the universe. I only mention this today because my employer (who will remain nameless even though I should reveal the spinless twats) promised on one thing and delivered another.  I am the model employee. I toe the line and never miss a day of work. I struggle to pay bills. I struggle to enjoy life. Why on earth, after such sacrifice and committment can you deny me my just rewards in our work TOGETHER? That's right we're together...not one above and one below aiming for the scraps. You and I are animals laboring towards the same goal. Talk about indirect de-motivativation.  It really only makes me want to slash their tires every day for six months. Only the pain and anguish of every day going to the parking garage and having to call a tow truck could be punishment equal to my aggrivation.Maybe that's my calling..The Corporate Justice League Chairman of Tire Slashing. If any wants to pay me for this...let me know.

						   The lesbian today got rowdy and tried to intimidate everyone with her pool acumen. I think she frequents the bar and has the old heads going crazy for her retro hippy lesbian antics. For me, it's just annoying. Congratulations, you're a lesbian. Everyone is really proud of you for coming out of the closet and proving that you can be what you want to be. But please, don't try to garner attention with your dock martins, black jeans, and leather jacket...meanwhile throwing disgusting looks in everyones direction. I think this kind of lesbian can only be called "dike". Much like if you are a w.o.p. ill call you a wop...even though you are italian. Everybody stop the act, it's okay do what you want but don't fulfill every stereotype known and don't expect congratulations or commendments on your extreme need to fit the mold. Lesbian or not you're still plugged in bitch.

						   I am disgusted. For some reason my blog post on June 2nd has failed the posting process. Perhaps I should save every draft. Too bad because the post was the most genius of all postings with content strong enough to break bones and bend biases. Oh well, it is probably perculating somewhere in web purgatory.

						   The rain has held off and the sun has brightly collided through the windows at work. I decided that I am finished trading for the day due to the fact that I am bored with the funky transfers taking place on my screen. The only thoughts parading through my head are dreams of jersey shore debauchery. The birds are chirping on the streets, I have my coach loafers on, my jeans are firmly pressed, and I am tan. As the saying goes, suns outs guns out. Why let another weekend escape without feeding the party desire? Don't worry I won't.
