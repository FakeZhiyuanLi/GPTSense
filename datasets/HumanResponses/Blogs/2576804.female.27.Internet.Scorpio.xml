      I am feeling a bit dissapointed at the moment...Though I told myself that I did my best umpteen times, I couldn't get over with that pricking feeling in my heart.  Wouldn't life be so much easier if people just speak up and respond to any given situation instead of making whole lot of assumptions which will end up with a whole lot of finger pointing and back stabbing?  Being a freshie in a company is not an excuse for poor deliverables. And I will not permit myself to indulge in such "privileges".   I have a deadline to meet on the 18th. And now my designer has to re-design the whole site structure because it doesn't comply with good web standards. I wished she'd given me the shout when things aren't "right"...that would give us more lead time to fix the problem...  Anyways, things might not be as bad as it appears. And I am grateful for that little hunch of mine this morning about the problem. It could be worst, if I hadn't question the website architecture.  *fingers crossed*

      There are several human characteristics that tops my annoyance list.    Hello Kitty lookalike and wannabe (Basically anything to do with the word "cute" and "girlie")   Slow coach   Cluess bunch   Bad breath and Body odor    I lost my cool in the office today. I could not find a better word to describe my irritation. I walked into the office today with high spirit to catch up with my work that I'd left behind on Monday, only to find myself becoming the "support personal" for a website that was suppose to go live today. Which by the way, took away half a day or my time!  When I agreed to oversee the project and do some minor changes on the pages. I did not expect a whole lot of last minute changes and messed-up to be thrown at my face. Esp. not on the day when the site was suppose to go live! I am not bitching, I am just ANNOYED. Being IT illiterate is not an excuse for poor resource and time management skill. It is also not a passport to screw up and dumped everything at the next person who is gonna help manage the project.   Telling me "I am sorry" is not gonna make me feel any better. Less likely to solve any problem. Infact, I hate the word "sorry". It's a word for a person that didn't try hard enough.  I am so glad that our copy writer will be concentrating full time on his writing! Project management is definately not his cup of tea.   Despite all that, I am so grateful to have a flash designer that I can count on. Who works within extremely tight schedule, and not forgetting my mentor in HK. Without them, I might as well bring my sleeping bag to the office. And for that, my designer definately deserve a lunch treat from me:)

      I seriously thought that my period is gonna hit me on the 11th. That'll be such a kill joy! I wouldn't wanna rush to the toilet and have all the nuns and monks raise an eye brow at the meditation camp. Now I don't have to worry about all that do I? :)   Yup! I'll be attending a meditation camp this Friday till Sunday. A part from waking up at 5am, meditate the whole day, I am not quite sure what to expect. A person like me, does a whole lotsa things by impulse (esp. to close friends), only to have that I-wished-I-shouldn't-have feeling. But sometimes, it's best to not think so much and let life/nature take it's course. I feel that if we rationalize too much, we stop living life and experiencing life to the fullest.   I've been wanting to know more about Buddism, about meditation, and participate in dharma talk. I've had life thrown at me some opportinities but didn't really made an effort for it. So this time, I am gonna let my cousin overpower me to the meditation camp :) Hmm...I wonder if I can sneaked in my digital camera to catch some snapshot in the temple ;p Now with all these talks, it made me kinda look forward for the camp.

      I am not feeling well...I should be resting...what the heck am I doing in a cyber cafe, checking office email?  With the extra working hours and the trips to office on weekends, I am starting to wonder if I'd really turned into a workaholic as proclaimed by my colleagues...Shit! What happened to work-life-balance that I strongly set my foot on to?  Monday was great (as usual) :) The site finally went live. And I've got another new project which I'll be working closely with Jac (our designer). Can't wait to see what she has got to offer with her creative mind! :)  Alright, I should get myself out from this stinking cyber cafe, head back home and make myself one jug of nice hot barley.  ciao!

      I stayed up till 9.30pm yesterday in the office, awfully tired and drained. After 2 hours of struggling, we still didn't managed to get the site up (Which was supposed to go live on 1st June). The problem wasn't entirely ours. We did our best, I did my best. But when we are dealing with logistic problems with a client in HK, support in UK and Japan, one week of production and testing is just not enough to get the site up and running. If there is a good reason behind what's happening here, it better send a message to everyone about a feasible timeline for future web projects.  However, I am feeling happy today. Especially when I have all the luck I wanted when I needed it most. After 2 months of chasing, Another client came back with updated content copy and images for the development of their corporate website. Now we can finally rock and roll!  Phew...this job is challenging alright! And my boss wasn't joking when he said he needed a detail-oriented person for this role.  I am doing my very best! I am sure a year or 2 from now, I will be much much better than what I am today :)  Ciao!

      I had a hair cut while waiting for Rozi @ KLCC. It was a good hair cut. Yippie! Now I have a bob! I am one step closer to that long jet black hair I've always wanted :D  It was great to see my ex colleagues at the movies. (Thanks for offering the ticket KB!)Though it's close to 2 months from my departure, I still feel very close to them, at heart. It's not that I am holding on to the past, nor am I unhappy with my current job. It's just that, good people and good friends are hard to come by. And I wanna keep that...it's a choice.  Well, it's Friday again and I've got my weekend planned out. I'll be accompanying my  urlLink best friend  tomorrow for her friend's wedding, and meeting Sylvia on Sunday.  Alright, gotta run for work.   Ciao!    6.30pm It's a Friday and I am stuck in the office...looks like it's gonna be another late night. The bad news is, the webmaster that we were frantically emailling to get the site up since 2 days ago is sick. The good news is, our client is getting another webmaster to help us. I hope we can settle everything today. I want a trouble-free weekend!  Well apart from that, everything was great today. Except for the momentary lapse of concentration when my "mat salleh" boss (frm HK) walked in with his khaki pants and blue stripe long sleeve shirt. *drolling*  Aw man...thank God he is not here all the time. Else I'll be in deep trouble. (with all that hallucination!)

      This is so frustrating!  urlLink Planet.time.net.my  has been down for 6 days! Urgh...Looks like I have to eat back my own words and start using blogspot :p I've got so much to blog about! Maybe later hehe...Now, I'm gonna grab my breakfast. I'm feeling GOOD today! :D Ciao!  6.19pm Something's awfully wrong. No news from Disney's webmaster on the June's update which was scheduled to go live today :( We did our best, we send out several emails, urgh! The waiting is killing me! I don't wanna stay back today, I don't wanna miss Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban in cinema today sob...sob... (Inn if you are reading this, one extra ticker frm my ex colleagues in Microsoft :p)  We are going through some restructuring and rebranding in the company. And yesterday, I met one of our "mat saleh" director from Hong Kong. Nothing much to shout about his looks, but his body is a feast to the eyes! Oooh...I am loosing my concentration as I am writing my blog ;p And he has this charisma that is so attractive!   The past couple of days has not been easy. I don't know how did I ended up in a momentary lapse of demotivating state. It has been a while since I felt like this. The self scrutinizing, self blamming etc etc...It was awful and very unattractive (am I right Inn?)  Thank God its all over now, thank God I've got my best friend, thank God I've got my lucky stone, thank God I've got my wisdom book! And thank God! I am still alive :D  6.37pm Okay I am gonna leave the office. I can't sit here and wait for a miracle for the site to go live. Because "miracle happens with least effort".  Ciao!
