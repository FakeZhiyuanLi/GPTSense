      now before i start i'd just like to say that i've basically completely lost track of time. this means that i won't be mentioning days and dates and possibley times because i just don;t know them.  so this fender competition requires u to send in your recorded entry by the 31st of July (believe me i only know that because i have the entry form), and i had it on cassette so i called up alex and asked if i could truck it down to his the next day to get my track onto CD. he agrees and we agree that i should stay the night the next day.  so the next day i get up early and shower and pack up my stuff. then at one mum says that she can;t give me a lift after all to i just sigh and grab some money and head out the door to get on the tube. after about an hour i get to alex's and he's outside in the garden watering the plants. we sit and he tells me about how the night before he was out by the river with some friends jumping off high objects (???) and how he'd landed badly and did his back in. we then get my track off the 4 track and onto the computer and onto CD and it turns out pretty good. later on int he after noon louis calls up and tells us to go over to his and then we'd go to some random BBQ which was taking place ontop of primrose hill. so me and alex bus it over to belsize park and we chilled at his for a bit. sam was there as well and we went to the park for a bit and louis allowed me some fo his dad's jonny walker black label which was some nice shit and he poured me about a 1/3 full in my empty bottle of lipton iced tea. later on we took the bus to primrose hill and soon after random people began appearing. max had a bottle of JD for me and i gladly received it. after a couple of hours there me, alex, ed and max took the tube down to waterloo. we hooked up with 2 girls (who i had no idea who they were) and me, max and ed pissed off some random tramp. then we bought about 12 cans of beer and got back on the tube but this time without the girls. we started on the beers and got off at maida vale. ed then gets a call from his dad and he says they have to go home. so we say goodbye and me and alex truck it down to some bench where we continue with our beers. alex then says he needs to take a dump so we walk back to his. we then sat in his garden for the rest of the night and by this time i'm over-tipsy from everything i'd drank that day (and night). then we have this bizarre conversation which apparently i said some cool stuff which i was saying way too loud. that meant i was drunk. i think i even sent an e-mail to james in china whilst alex was disposing of his load up stairs.  woke up the next day dry mouthed and nose bleeding. felt pretty shitty. had some lunch with alex and then allowed it back home...what a day...

      Yes yes i know, i havn;t blogged in a bit. quite a while to be honest. fine...so i'll update everthing now. the time is 3:35 and its uh...monday...and i'm off to the cinema in about an hour and bit to see spidyman with my little bro. the weathers rather bland and the sky's kinda white. the radios on virgin and its playing the new maroon 5 song which is just kinda droning on in my head.  oh yeh, a couple o' days ago i got the new van halen double CD thing and it rocks...as van halen always do. i've ordered contraband (finally) and it ought to be here tomorrow and the the book (the hole) came this morning. i'm still wondering where the hell my velvet revolver tickets are but i reckon they'll get here some time in the near future... jonny left for jewish camp in barcelona yesterday...or was it the day before...? also saw the most hardcore film ever the other night BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD: DO AMERICA. if u haven;t already seen it...well see it. it also has love rollercoaster on the sound track which makes it all the more hardcore than it already was.  christ...its already the 26th...i need to get that music piece onto CD and have it sent off by the 31st...or did it have to get there by the 31st? fuck. i ought to call up alex and see if i can truck it round to his and do it on his computer. i also have plenty of funky shit to show him (if only that happened both ways).  ha...oh yeh...i was meant to go swimming with jonny the other day and we found that the pool was closed so we just spent the afternoon in the arcade. jonny managed to win one of them giant toys off the big crane game. it was some retarded giant green fish which he now treasures... i also now have plans on purchasing a new amplifier. a 100watt monster full of valves to be exact. thats why yesterday i was playing my current amp on 10 and strumming the same chord over and over again trying to see how it copes with high volumes. inevitabley the neighbours came round knocking telling me to shut the fuck up...well, turn the fuck down rather... ah, speaking of turning knobs...i need to explain our (the bands) potrntial future plan.   PROJECT MOTHERSHIP:  To keep it simple, me and jonny have drafted a plan for what the abnd should do next summer (plus jonny himself who is the geek and co-producer). we plan on going to the city of angels and book a weeks recording seesion at the Mothership Studios in Hollywood. But check this out...it costs 4000 pounds for a weeks accomommodation for 4 people in a fucking amazing house next to the studio and 12 hours of studio time every day. now for 4 grand that is cheap. so all we have to do now is raise some cash by doing some gigs and selling some CDs etc...then we can go and record our debut album at one of the most famous and most hardcore studios in the world (SLASH has recorded there before). I still need to run this by james and alex but they should say yes just because it'll be such great fun and a properly hardcore experience as well.   ha...jonny said to me the other day he had written a very long blog...amateur...

      ...from not blogging for a couple of days. Not too much has happened. Went to brighton yesterday and spent most of the days in eastbourne. i ought to buy a house there someday and start my own recording studio. the place is so damn peaceful and there are plenty of nice gardens and parks to chill in and a whole seafront to check out.  also saw some interesting films in the past couple o' days. the first film was called stigmata which was a about some random woman who starts getting random wounds of which belonged to christ and gets help from a hardcore priest. the film i saw last night was horrific. it was called the hole and it was basically about these four teenagers who go partying in an underground bunker and get trapped. it was so hardcore i ordered the book off amazon this morning. and at the moment i have termintor 2 pumping from the TV.  god my throat hurts...i've gotta cut down on the crisps and chocolates and shit...

      oh man...just got back from enterprise studios after a pretty damn boring practice session. in seven hours we did mostly shit, crap or whatever u like to call it and in the end only managed to finish a little rocky piece since we were pretty uninspired. my fingertips r litrally melting off my fingers and its not funny. Then i had to drag my pedals and my guitar back home...god...so tired... suppose it was much worse this morning as it was raining quite a bit and i had to walk to the bus stop.  So after all this i'm here at the computer with a nice ice cold beer and babylon by david gray on the radio. i think i'm going to see my aunt on friday so i might have to call jonny to see if we can reschedule that business meeting over a coffee. i ought to call him but chances are he'l call me first (as always). i'm off. maybe i'll drop back here later...*sigh* i also ought to call alexi tomorrow and see how his meeting with his ex went. everyone seems to say she's an extreme bitch and i only spoke to her over the phone while i was a bit "off the ball" so i wouldn;t really know. according to him raphi wants a piece of her as well. just like raphi to get in the way...ha...poor alexi...hope it goes well. allow.

      so apparently me and jonny r gonna head out for a coffee to discuss his great "plan" on friday. he even said that he'd make a powerpoint presentation so we could do this properly (the idea of turning up wearing suits was kinda dropped...any sane person will realise why). *sigh* gotta pack my gear together for the big jam tomorrow...gotta get up early too...

      So i get home yesterday and i'm pretty tired (as always) so i stick in Die another Day and sit back on the sofa watching the film. Then my phone rings and i answer. jonny talks on the other line and he says he needs to ask me a question. i say go ahead and he asked my opinion on how possible it would be for two 15 year olds (like us) to get a number one single in the UK managing a pop act. so i answer very possible and leave it at that since jonny's always full of bizarre questions. he then goes on and explains his whole plan on how he's going to find a pop act and get them to number one in the charts. now u gotta understand that at this point i'm completely lost and he's the only one left talking. after he's hammered some of his ideas into my head, he asks if i'm in. as always, i'm not too reluctant on this as i have no idea how far he was going to take it so i say to him that whatever he does, i'll be with him all the way.  After we cleared that, i ask him about how the hell he was going to find a pop act to take to number one and he carefully explains to me his theories and hypothesis'. He tells me that most successful pop acts are male (well guys our age at least) because all the gals go out and buy their CD's and go along to their concerts and scream etc... Then he says that it would be helpful to find someone (male) who was a very popular guy in as many ways as possible inorder to make things easier for us. then he explains how we organise a couple of gigs for this guy and then try and sell some CD's. then offer it to a radio station after he gets a bit more of a reputation. and from then on goes our claim to fame and in comes the cash rolling right into our hands.  Then i say to him quite bluntly: when u find the guy, call me. since i still didn;t know whether he was 100% serious, i couldn;t be asked to put in any effort in getting this thing going. he then sighs and says ok. he says he would draw up a whole list of the stages of his plan and what he intends to do and then we would meet up for lunch and discuss it over a nice cup of coffee. so i say ok and he says he'd call me some time during the week.  i'm kinda looking forward to this meeting and too hear more of his crazy ideas. the funny thing is, he is convinced that the chances of us doing this is very high. i think i might just be believing him...

      ok...beat jonny at goldeneye 12-3 and got slapped to death in the end...so back now to this blog thing. s'ppose i'm meant to say something incredibley witty or something or other to make u all think that i'm o so clever, but its way too early in the morning for that sorta thing. *sigh* so now we've abandoned this whole finishing goldeneye thing cos we've realised that we can;t do it. so now we've just decided to watch wrestlemania since it is so hardcore. i kinda need a drink. my throat is pretty damn dry from the ham pineapple and sweetcorn pizza we just had. stuffed crust n' all. fun for the whole family.  oh yeh, i just had a revelation. i need a pair of bowling shoes. they look unbelievabley cool and feel so comfortable its shocking (although we all know (thanks to janes...) that nothings shocking...)  jonny's gone downstairs to get some water cos we';re both pretty thirsty.   to the small minority of hardcore people who will read this post - please excuse my spelling. i hope it isn;t so bad that it can;t be read but i have a tendency to use ; instead of ' which i'm sure if u continue to read on u will get very used to.   here comes jonny with the water. hes brought ice as well. what a nice guy.   so jonnys going on about hugh grant and some film called 2 weeks notice and he's cued the video.

      So i'm sitting here in jonny's house and its like quarter past 2 in the tender hours of the morning. we went bowling this evening at the hollywood bowl and ran into some dudes who happened to be vai and zappa fans. such a small world...all thanks to my vai t-shirt. so after that we allowed it back to jonny's house and continued to attempt to complete goldeneye from scratch. at the moment we're on the second bunker on secret agent and we've kinda got bored. hence me typing here and jonny setting up a multiplayer game. be back in a second. need to kill...

      Yeh...and so here i am on this bizarre website which just requires u to write write write. frankly i have no idea what the hell is going on and i am pretty damn tired. funny how it was only a couple of days when i had stayed fully awake for over 30 hours...and in the process i kinda lost track of time and space and i had no clue as to what day it was in relation to everything else...as if what i wrote makes any sense at all. so as i'm typing this up, at the same time i'm downloading times like these by the foo fighters since i just realised how much i liked that song.  Due to the fact i have nothing better to do, i guess i'll just carry on typing stuff up. u see there is not point at all and i repeat NO POINT at all in reading any of this. i guess some time in the next couple of years i'll read this stuff and realise what a loser i used to be. I suppose in a way i'll be able to keep a sort of mind log of what occurs throughout my triesome days of work and school and attempt to try and recall all the nights that i spend drinking JD until either i suddenly find the bottle empty or realise that the bottles been snatched away from me because all my friends think i could die any second. sounds absurd doesn't it? i for one do think so.   Just bought a ticket for the velvet Revolver gig in september. i kinda freaked out as my computer crashed just asi was about to press the BUY button. its absolutely outrageous how misleading the prices for these damn tickets r. its like: velvet revolver, hammersmith apollo, 17.50. So u think to yourself: hey, thats pretty reasonable and u click on the link and tap in your details. they show u a subtotal, and thats where u realise that they;re gonna charge u a shitload more. in the end, if u include the service charge and the handling fee or something else or other, it came to 25.50. its not very expensive, but it is 8 pounds off the original value of the ticket. s'ppose those of you who r bored enough to be even looking at this page don;t live in london where everything is outrageously priced.  There goes the TV on the other side with my little bro watching the simpsons at full volume. mum's calling. must be dinner time. chances r i'll come back later. sad eh?
