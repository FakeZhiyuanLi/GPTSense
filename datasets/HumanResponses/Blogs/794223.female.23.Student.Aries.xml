						    urlLink    Sleepy Listening to: NPR News  Had my Fulbright interview today.  Overall, it went well.  I'll have to basically re-write my project proposal, but other than that, I'm feeling pretty good about it.    Joe, my Fulbright mentor, happens to be on the UT committee and gave me several very good pointers on improving the project proposal.  He understood my wanting to draw a correlation between observations I had about the Cuban educational system and the possible effect of technology on education in Brazil.  Where one is lacking the other has, and vice versa.  The application still needs alot of work before I send it off to the committee in New York, but at least I have a panel here at UT designed to aid me in the process, in making my application the best that it can be.  I'm pretty sleepy--been up since the crack of dawn.  Nobody should have to be up before the sun has risen.  Nappy time.

						    urlLink    Inspired Listening to: Forth Eorlingas (The Two Towers: Lord of the Rings Soundtrack)~ You know that part at the end of the battle at Helms Deep when Gandalf the White comes charging down the mountain with the crew from Edoras?  Yeah...that's the background music ;-)  I'm such a goober, but I do love the Lord of the Rings so much.  I think because it epitomizes the struggle between good and evil, among other things.  I read somewhere about elves in the story:  "They have more beauty than any other creatures on earth, but also possess the most extreme happiness and sorrow"  I can identify with that.  Perhaps not the beauty part, but certainly with the ability to feel things so deeply.  I met this one man at a coffee shop once who has been reading palms for 13 years, and he took one look at my left palm and said:  "You have the uncanny ability to experience emotions more deeply than any other human being I've ever known.  You absorb extreme amounts of energy from everything around you; you absorb energy from that coffee table over there.  This can be beneficial in some cases, as it would enable you to be deeply affected by others around you, and you can experience the most extreme sense of euphoria.  But be careful--because you are so deeply affected by everything and everyone around you, you can also experience the most profound sorrow."  Note to self.

						    urlLink    Happy Listening to: The Best of the Gypsy Kings  I got to know THE coolest guy last night while we were studying for our Spanish prose class.  His name is Trevor, and he works at Dell.  He used to be a computer science major, but after he spent a year in Mexico, he decided that it was better to actually study something that he enjoyed.  So he's switching to Latin American Studies very soon.  Bad-ass.  It was, by far, the coolest thing I'd heard of in a long time.  I've got a Latin American politics midterm on Thursday (with a mountain of reading), and a project in Spanish prose on the same day.  I better get cracking on the books.  (When do I not?)  On a random note, I still love my new Mac :-P

						   Oh. My. Goodness.  I am so exhausted that I can barely keep my eyes open.  I'm going to bed very soon--this entire Fulbright process has worn me out.  Fortunately, tomorrow round 1 of the process will be over, when I turn in my application and materials to UT. (minus the recommendation letters--they should be in sometime early next week)  Round 2 will be the interviews in early October, followed by sending the finished app to New York.  Then there's round 3, where Brazil decides...  Very complicated process, but understandable considering how much money a full Fulbright scholarship is worth.  I'm very excied--I think I have a very good chance of getting it.  But even if I don't, that's ok.  I have several back-up plans.  And I will probably go back to the School of the Future in São Paulo to investigate them futher, Fulbright or no.  Today I made the 10,000 mile hike from 23rd and Rio Grande to the Latin American Studies Institute over on Red River (Again. I live there, pretty much).  Seriously.  If I make enough money one day, I'm going to ensure that there's a specific shuttle to that joint.  Of course, this would be the home of my major, the Benson library, my advisors, and all my research.  I'm nodding as I type.  It's definitely time for some much-needed sleep.

						    urlLink    Exhausted Listening to: The Weather Channel  I'm feeling annoyingly unpatriotic today, considering the date.  I see all these people on the news mourning the deaths of those lost 2 years ago, and I feel terrible for them.  But I'm so angry and upset with American foreign policy that it's almost gotten to the point that I see an American flag and think "WTF is wrong with us?!  I give up--I'm leaving."  Which, on a day like today, makes me further pissed off b/c I feel like I'm not being respectful enough.  Maybe I just need to go ahead and permanently move to Latin America.  Might as well--the majority of my waking moments are spent planning how to get back anyway.  Speaking of going back...I'm going mad trying to finish this Fulbright application for Brazil.  The really good news is that (and I think this is fate) I e-mailed half a dozen people in a stressed-induced panic about everything from being sponsored in Sao Paulo to getting recommendation letters.    Seriously--I shit you not--everybody replied within 30 minutes.  The director of the program in Brazil, the Fulbright advisor at UT, and the profs who are writing my rec letters.  And this was like 10:00 at night.  They all told me either a) not to worry b) they'd be thrilled to sponsor me, or c) it wouldn't be a problem if recommendation letters got in a little after the due date.  Did I mention that Joe Straubhaar, the director of the Brazil center and one of the good friends of the man sponsoring my project in Brazil, also happens to be on the UT Fulbright committee?  I am so excited.  And even if I don't get the scholarship, I'd love to go back to Brazil and research the topic further.

						    urlLink    Contemplative  Let me tell you a story that was told by our Latin American Politics professor to our class last Thursday-to give you an idea of how fragile "democracy" is in our world.  Professor Dietz was in Peru in 1980, just folllowing the election between Reagan and Carter.  On Wednesday morning after the election, he was having coffee with a fellow academian, who happened to be a very well educated Peruvian.  The headline of the front page of the local paper, of course, read "Reagan defeats Carter in United States election", or something similar.  Dietz's Peruvian friend, very intelligent but accustomed to a completely different political environment, looked at his American friend straight in the face and their conversation went as follows: Peruvian: So, Reagan has won the election, correct? Dietz: Yes, that's correct. Peruvian: Well...does this mean that he will now assume power? Dietz: (looking puzzled) Yes...Reagan will be the next President of the United States. Peruvian: But how do you know for sure?  How do you respond to a question like that?  We Americans take for granted the idea that following each election (the 2000 Presidential election notwithstanding), the person who wins takes office and retains power for the next 4 years.  Another election is then held, and the democratic process repeats itself.    Things are not so simple in Latin America.  As we have seen in the case of Venezuela, democracy is a very fragile system in the majority of the rest of the world.  After almost 50 years of stable, 2-party elections, the Venezuelan political system just collapsed.  Just like that.    Have you ever considered the possibility that representative democracy, as we know it, will cease to exist after a time, or that there is any other option for government?  The way our government operates is the exception to the rule, not the norm.  Until we realize this, we will always be in constant battle with other nations that fail to see, for better or worse, the way we operate.  Until we put ourselves in other people's shoes and in their environments, we cannot fully comprehend their lives that are so very different from our own.  If my trips to Cuba and Brazil taught me anything, they have taught me that much.

						    urlLink    Excited  Hey, everybody listen up: on Tuesday, September 9th, the U.S. Congress will vote on the Flake Amendment. This proposes to end the travel ban to Cuba. It is high time that Congress address this issue; this ban not only infringes upon our constitutional rights, but it hurts the Cuban population as well.  If you'd like to e-mail your representative (if you're in Austin, it would either be Lamar Smith or Lloyd Doggett), go to the website below:   CIP Action Center   Let's take action, people. For far too long has the United States kept up its groundless foreign policy towards its neighbor 90 miles to the south.

						    urlLink    Blah Watching: NFL Opening Night  I'm tired, very tired. It's not as if I'm not getting enough sleep, so I have no idea why I have no energy. Perhaps I should start taking more vitamins.  I need to win the lottery, so that I can give several million dollars to those that do mental health research. Considering that 1 out of 4 people are mentally ill, you would think that our society would give a damn, but they don't. Not that hundreds of millions of dollars for things like muscular distrophy research is not worth-while, but it just seems to me that we don't put mental health research on our top priority list. The mind is one of the most precious things that we have--why not protect it?  My classes are good so far, except my Spanish prose prof just likes to hear himself speak. He'll ask you a question and give you that blank stare that says "I know you don't know the answer, you ignorant child, but I'm going to ask you anyway so that I shoot you down in 30 seconds." Professors like that drive me nuts. Fortunately he's the first one I've encountered like that at UT, which is good. I fully intend to challenge him as much as humanly possible in class this semester.  On a random note, I want to marry Bill Maher.

						    urlLink    Frustrated  I am SO TIRED of so many obstacles being thrown in my path.  If anyone even ATTEMPTS to come up to me and talk about how stressed they are, they've got another thing coming.  So just when I thought that the study abroad credit processing for Cuba was over, here comes yet another road block.  Not only did it take over a year for my 4th grade to reach UT, but now study abroad can't process my credits because the courses from Cuba need to meet specific requirements for the stupid-ass Spanish "concentration" that goes along with the Latin American Studies degree.  As a matter of fact, there has been so much grief in the past 3 or 4 years, and so much bickering between the LAS department, study abroad, and the College of Liberal Arts, that Latin American Studies is (finally) re-writing requirements for the degree; the current requirements are a red-tape procedural NIGHTMARE.  So now I am going to have to write 3 new course description forms, that I shouldn't have to write, so that the Spanish, Latin American Studies, and Liberal Arts departments can all fight over whether or not I get Spanish credit for courses conducted in Spanish in a Spanish speaking country.  Then, yesterday I get a letter in the mail saying that the GRE people had, apparently, lost my application and fees.  I am applying for extended time due to my learning disability (OCD); and that too has been a bureaucratic nightmare.  I had to have my psychiatrist write a letter not once, not twice, but 3 TIMES in order for UT to sign off on it, only to get a letter from the GRE people stating that they wouldn't accept the form from UT and that I would have to submit documentation to them "directly".  I am running out of time--I need to apply to Graduate Schools soon, and to do that I need to have already taken the GRE by like, yesterday.    So basically, people who are not doing their jobs and not communicating with me correctly are making my life miserable.  And I've already mentioned the "you can't apply to graduate and be simultaneously enrolled at ACC" mess.  Fortunately, that's about the only thing that has been worked out so far.  I feel as if I am in my senior year of highschool at Westlake all over again.  I feel like I am going to get a diploma IN SPITE OF everyone and everything at UT and elsewhere.  I work so hard, do things so dilligently, and then every time I turn around some ass-hole who is not doing their job throws another road block in my face.  For the past week now I have been bawling my eyes out, suffering from nausea-causing migraines, and no sleep.  I am almost to the breaking point.  But all I can do is turn it over to the Lord, because there is only so much that I can handle.  God must have infinitely more patience than I, and I am a pretty patient person.  The incompetance and disgrace with humanity would make me give up long ago if I were in His shoes.  And so He dies for us to give us yet ANOTHER chance, and we continue to be ass-holes.  Infinite patience.  He has infinite patience.

						    urlLink    Silly  Haha--guess what I'm going to be for Halloween?  Let me give you a clue: I saw him in person December of last year, on that forbidden island 90 miles to the south of us...  When Jessica's roommate mentioned that she wanted to be Napoleon for Halloween, I thought, "'Hey--why don't I be Fidel?!  I reserve the write to do that, b/c I lived in Cuba for a semester." ;-)  I'm all too excited.  Tomorrow I'm going on a hunt for a solid olive-green army suit, and a beard.  Gotta have the beard.  ::strokes chin::  I was thinking--wouldn't it be hilarious if I also got out one of my real Cuban cigars?  How fantastic would that be.  I just watched the Democratic debate, and as usual, I have no idea who I'm voting for in the primaries.  Not that it matters, really.  As long as a democrat wins in '04 and Bush gets kicked out, I couldn't care less which one it is.  I'm gonna go try and get some work done.  Bleh...I'm so tired of studying!  Thank God it'll be over for awhile in December...

That's right...our president will actively defy both houses of Congress and (probably) a majority of the American people's opinion (again). Let me reiterate: if he "wins" again, I'm moving indefinately to either Cuba or Brazil, depending on the circumstances and my mood.

						    urlLink    Angry  So apparently, the U.S. government is going to start using the Department of Homeland Security as a means by which to hunt down Americans attempting to enter Cuba from Mexico or Canada.  They should be using that department to catch terrorists, not Americans who happen to think the travel ban is a piece of crap.  I'm certainly blessed that I had the opportunity to travel to Cuba legally when I did--before the new restrictions from OFAC and the Treasury department were announced.  Despite that fact that both the House and the Senate have passed ammendments to either lift the travel ban completely or ease new restrictions on travel (like for educational purposes), our jack-ass president has vowed to veto the measures.  I'm serious--if he "wins" again, I'm moving indefinately to either Brazil or Cuba.    I am simply baffled more and more every day at the lack of our intelligence in foreign policy.  As if the economic embargo over Cuba has been successful.  Come ON.  It has simply become a political issue due to a small but insane group of people in Florida who threaten to withhold electoral votes for a president or would-be president of the U.S. if he even thinks about improving relations with Cuba.  The embargo MAY have held some sort of validity in '61 when it was first put in place, (and even that is suspect--I have been reading recently declassified documents discussing how the CIA was planning a U.S. invasion of Cuba long before the missile crisis arrived) but now it's just bad foreign policy.  Not only are the Cuban people suffering, but the embargo is now just providing Fidel a scapegoat by which to rally his masses against the imperalist creeps to the north.  (Even if he does have a point)  Do you honestly believe that the socialist system would have survived in Cuba this long if we had been actively trading with Cuba this whole time?  Of course not.  Capitalism puts the socialist system at risk, along with all social welfare programs like free education and health care.  Our officials know nothing.  I'm sorry...that whole argument of "we can't trade with you because you're an authoritarian dictator"...does not hold water anymore.  Why?  Because we have monetarily, politically, and militarily SUPPORTED the most brutal, human-rights-defying, evil, cruel military dictatorships in Latin America for years, all because they claimed to be capitalist and anti-communist.  Familiar with the Argentine dirty wars?  The over-throw of the democratically elected Allende and the installation of the Pinochet regime?  U.S. government money funding the Guatemala military dictatorships that wreaked havoc for over 30 years?  I could keep the list going, but I think my point has been made.  Dammit, at least be consistent with your policy--if you're against dictators, be against ALL dictatorships, regardless of what economic and political policy they propose.    Fuckin' a.  I hate our foreign policy.

						   Mood: Glad that the Fulbright ordeal is over with...  I took another Oceanography test today at ACC.  Made a 91, I believe.  Too bad the grade is just pass/fail when it goes to UT.  Oh well.  2 down, 2 more to go.  I need to get this thing wrapped up before Thanksgiving if I want to graduate.    I am very ready for next semester, when I can just lounge around and read whatever books I want.  I still need to finish The Two Towers and Return of the King; Bill Maher's new book, several books on Cuba; and some other books I've been meaning to crack open for years, but never have had the chance to due to work/school, and they've just been collecting dust.  I've decided too, that I'd like to tutour Spanish to high school kids who want it or need it next semester.  Also, a trip to go see Mildred in Boston awaits me during her spring break in April, and maybe a ski trip with Aaron in January.  These things are what keep me going currently during this very stressful last semester at UT--plus my strong will and desire to have a diploma in my hands that says I graduated in 3 years.  I'm hoping that I'll add a "with honors" to that also; looking likely, but we'll see.  The important thing is the degree.  I'm going to bed early tonight.  Very excited about that.  Tenho fome/tengo hambre/I'm hungry.  Off to go raid the fridge.

THAT'S when you know you've got an excellent CD.  Today has been my day.  I was running errands on campus until 3~turning in last-minute things for my Fulbright application, and processing my study abroad credits. (FINALLY! After an entire year, my Cuba grades are at last being processed!)  Afterwards I went to Texadelphia, enjoyed a sandwich and a Dos Equis.  Mmmmm...it had been so long since I'd had a good beer.  Then I treated myself to a bit of shopping at the Woman's Co-op on the Drag, and came home.  I'm floating around in my new Longhorn flip flops that are as comfortable as air, and listening to good music.  I'm going to watch Bill Maher tonight on HBO, go to bed early, and at last get a good night's rest.  I have had the longest and most difficult week ever, and dammit, I'm ready to enjoy some R & R, at least until later on this weekend when I have to take another Oceanography exam at ACC.  But that shouldn't be too bad.  I think I'll go take a nap :-)

						    urlLink    Going nuts...  Everybody and their dog is trying to prevent me from graduating in December.  Some key background information regarding my current situation:  -I get this email from UT the other day telling me, "Oh, yes and by the way~You cannot apply to graduate in December if you are currently enrolled in a class at ACC."  Thanks for telling me this ahead of time, ass holes.  -My grade from Cuba (Fall 2002, a YEAR ago) is just now getting here.  Let me repeat that.  MY GRADE FROM A YEAR AGO HAS JUST NOW GOTTEN ACROSS THE OCEAN TO MY STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM, WHO THEN FINALLY SENT IT TO UT.  -My Oceanography professor emails me, tells me that she cannot send out a final grade until the end of the semester, but would a note suffice?  -I go back to Liberal Arts.  No, a letter will not suffice--you need an official transcript from ACC, before December 5th.  The fall semester at ACC doesn't even end until December 12th.  -I call ACC in a panic.  They tell me that I can get a transcript sent out earlier if I finish the course at an earlier date, if I fill out a 'Early Grade Release Request form' and have my professor sign that form and place it in a sealed envelope and then have that taken to Admissions and Records to be processed.  -I go to ACC to pick up said form, they tell me I cannot get the form until I have an official letter from UT stating that I am a graduating senior who needs this grade released early.  -I return home, wanting to throw something.  Dammit, I am going to graduate in December; I have worked too hard to graduate in 3 years to NOT, and it would be rediculous to have all of my coursework completely finished for my degree and then not receive one.  So now, I just need to hurry up and finish this course at ACC (like in the next 3 weeks), get my study abroad credits (finally) processed, and have Profe Salgado turn in a grade for my thesis (for both semesters).  It will then be done!  And I will be done.  And I will take one long, extended nap next semester.  With a degree for December 2003 on my wall.  Gosh darn it!

						    urlLink    Confused  Take a look at this schedule for the remaining days of the Fall semester: December 5-7 (Friday-Sunday): Fall Graduation ceremonies in the colleges and schools. December 8-9, 14 (Monday-Tuesday, Sunday): No-class days. December 10-13, 15-16 (Wednesday-Saturday, Monday-Tuesday): Fall semester final examinations, except in the School of Law.  Does anyone else find this schedule to be a bit, oh...odd? So, I graduate on December 5th, from the College of Liberal Arts, effectively ending my college career. (pre-Graduate school, anyway). Then I take final exams for this semester five days later...?  That's like saying, "Ok...here's your degree! Great job! Ok, now that you're through, would you mind taking these final exams, please?"  For argument's sake, I am well aware that I don't receive the actual degree on Dec. 5th--it won't be confered until the 20th, which means I won't actually have it in my hands until January. Still...something tells me that it will feel monumentally odd walking into a final exam 5 days after I've (supposedly) graduated. Somehow, doesn't sit very right with me.

						    urlLink    Peaceful  Had a meeting today with Joe Straubhaar, my Fulbright mentor.  He looked over my new proposal and, to my surprise, didn't have me wad it up and throw it in the trash.  I asked, "is it reasonable, plausible?"  He replied, "it's more than reasonable and plausible.  It's actually good."  Good news there.  But...even if my application does pass the 2nd round (New York), there is no necessary guarantee that Brazil will approve of it.  We'll just have to keep our fingers crossed.  If Fulbright doesn't work out, there's always Grad School, and of course--Cuba.  I have so many damn things to do between now and December, it's not even funny.   I should get working on one of those many things, instead of procrastinating like an ass.

It's very difficult to make A's in that class...not to mention that he used one of my essays as an example!  It was the supreme self-esteem booster of the month.  Sorry, I know no one else really cares.  But it was definitely what I needed to hear after a very difficult beginning to the semester.  On a couple of random notes: I will be SO glad when this damn re-call thing is over in California, so that we can finally talk about SOMETHING ELSE.  I really hope that they won't have a governor Arnold.  Eww.    Secondly: a tiger has no place in either an apartment as somebody's pet, a zoo, or a 3-ringed circus for that matter.  If you're concerned about species endangerment, they have habitats that are specialized to mimic as closely as possible their natural habitats, without hundreds of clapping spectators or an obvious idiot who thinks that having a wild beast for a pet half the size of his apartment is a grand idea.  Oh humanity.  It's nappy time.

						    urlLink    Uncertain  I feel as if my life is being pulled in two different directions.  On the one hand, I have Brazil: applying for the Fulbright, and possibly researching in São Paulo the effects of new technology on education.  On the other I have Cuba.  Where do we start with Cuba?  Where I spent an entire semester and have invested a year of my work and scholarly research.  Where I left my heart.  I'm trying, though somewhat unsuccessfully at the moment, to do a comparison study between the two countries and how they differ in their educational systems.  Basically, if I could create utopia, I would transplant Cuba's mass-education to Brazil, and keep it that way in Cuba.  You know what scares me more than not getting the Fulbright for Brazil?  Actually getting it.  Where would that take me in life?  I can't just drop Cuba if I get the Fulbright for Brazil.  Why can't I just jump between the two countries?  Why would I have to specialize in just one?  Furthermore, at some point I'm going to have to choose an academic area to specialize in.  I want to eventually get my doctorate in international relations, but as Joe put it, I'll have to sell myself to a discipline.  I can't get a job in Latin American Studies; I have to specialize.  Whether it's economics, education, anthropology, or communications, I'm going to have to make a choice.  I hate that.  I want to study everything.  There are moments when my nostalgia undulates, waxes and wanes between Brazil and Cuba.  From Havana to Bahia, and back.  I feel deep down as if my ultimate purpose is to deal with Cuba, and yet there's this other part of me saying, "Wait. Give Brazil a chance."  Both countries have astounding things to offer, in different ways.  Fulbright does offer you the option of doing dual-country studies.  But due to the embargo over Cuba and current travel restrictions, I can't do that, at least not under Fulbright money.  That's very frustrating.  I've pretty much decided that if I get the Fulbright, I'm going back to Cuba anyway before heading down to Brazil.  I have no idea how, or when.  I won't be a student, technically, so it'll be next to impossible to get my hands on a legal license to travel there.  But I don't care.  I have too much that needs to be finished there to not return.   In sum, I have no idea what's going on.  I think I'm interested in far too many things at once.  It's almost 5am--better get some shut-eye.  Just got back from a party at Sarah and Jenny's house.  It was so good seeing them again--my dear, fellow Latin America enthusiests.  There's always the best music at their parties.

						    urlLink    Content Watching: Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (for like the 10th time on HBO...)  Overall, Thanksgiving went relatively well. The only downside was the fact that my cousins wanted to get up before the crack of dawn on Friday morning to take advantage of the after-Thanksgiving-shopping marathons and super low prices. I stayed up until about 1:00am working, then went to bed. Unfortunately, I couldn't get to sleep, and at 5:15 the alarm went off. My cousin Brandi came upstairs with a migraine, and threw up several times. Poor baby. I truly can sympathize, because in high school I used to get migraines 3 to 4 times a week. Some of the worst pain I've ever experienced--the equivalent of what an ice pick through one side of the head must feel like. I've become nauseated with the pain before as well.  So...needless to say, I didn't get any sleep Thursday night. The whole thing messed up my sleep schedule, as I was planning on waking up early Friday morning and working. I still have so much to do: finish my thesis, write a 10-page paper for Spanish prose, study for my anthropology exam on Wednesday, and write a graduate school proposal statement. No clue how I'm going to get all that done by next week.   The house looks lovely~ Aunt Rite and my cousins and I decorated the tree and the rest of the house for Christmas. I love our Christmas tree--it's like 11 feet tall with hundreds of ornaments on it. This is most definitely my favorite time of the year.  Less than one week until I graduate! Weeee!!! (I have to take a final a week after I graduate, of course.)

						    urlLink    Frustrated  The UT bureaucracy seriously needs to slim down--this is rediculous.  So I walk triumphantly into Liberal Arts today, with ACC transcript in hand.  Oceanography is done, the grade is being processed as we speak in admissions.  Everything seemed to be going well, until the advisor noticed that, apparently within the last few weeks, UT randomly changed the geology requirements, and now the ACC Oceanography course I took is under 'Marine Sciences'.  It WAS GEOL 307, now it's MS something or another.  Why the hell would they change a course mid-semester?  Furthermore, now the Liberal Arts advisor has to go through and do YET ANOTHER over-ride for my degree b/c PEOPLE AT UT DON'T COMMUNICATE WITH ME.    Then, after I finally filled out the form to officially graduate, she said that they couldn't change the program, b/c it had already been sent off to be printed out.  So...the graduation program will have a little * by my name that says I'm walking, not graduating.  I AM GRADUATING.  I will have a degree that says I graduated in December, the Fall of 2003.  Which in the grand scheme of things, is all that matters I suppose.  Still...why didn't these people tell me this earlier?!  I would have gotten the ACC course finished even sooner had I known that the graduation programs had to be sent out for printing last week.    So.  Note to everyone out there who gives a damn: I am graduating, regardless of what the program says.  In 3 years, with University and Departmental Honors, I might add.  Take THAT stupid UT bureaucracy...and Westlake High School.  I made it in spite of you.

						    urlLink    Amused  I had a native Spanish speaker tell me today that I have a Cuban accent. (!) Honestly, I really had no idea that I had picked up one. Ana said, "Oh yeah..the way you cut off some of your words...and the melody of your Spanish. It's very cubano." On the other hand, when I came back from southern Spain, I had apparently picked up their accent as well--but I had recognized that, since you couldn't really miss the fact that I pronounced nearly every "s" with a "th" sound that even became annoying to me after awhile. "Gra(th)ia(th)" instead of "Gracias". Not that I could help it. So I had that Andalucian, southern Spain accent until I went to Cuba, when I finally dropped it. I was not consciously aware, however, that I had picked up the Cuban habit of dropping most of my "s" 's altogether until today. So now apparently it's "Mucha gracia..." I guess picking up the Cuban version of Spanish was more subconsious than anything else, since I spent so much time there.  It's funny how one will pick up dialects. I am consciously aware of my Carioca (Rio de Janeiro) Portuguese, because again it is impossible not to notice that I'm pronouncing an "s" as an "sh". "Fes(h)tas", "es(h)ta fazendo", ect. I think that's because the first native Brazilian that taught me Portuguese was from Rio, and I had her for over a year, hence my picking up her way of speaking. I guess there's something with me and the pronouncing of "s" in various romantic languages that changes frequently--who knows. I wonder if I'll drop the Rio dialect and pick up the São Paulo version if I get the Fulbright and move there. Probably--though it would probably take a while.  I have so much to do over Thanksgiving--it's not going to be much of a vacation at all. I have to: -Study for the GRE -Write my personal statement for Grad Schools -Write a 10-page paper for Spanish prose -Read the U.S.-Latin American relations book for Dietz's class -Finish my thesis -Clean the house, and help put up decorations for Christmas  I don't think I'm leaving anything out...besides the fact that I graduate about a week after Thanksgiving.  ;-)

						    urlLink    Silly  This evening all the UT students that went on Joe's study abroad program to Brazil gathered together at Maria's house to eat good food, share photos, and take a break from this all-too-hectic American lifestyle that obviously none of us enjoys that much.  Foi muito divertido, sim.  One of the funniest moments EVER was when Jessica barged in: Jessica:  I am so high. ::strange, amusing silence:: Everyone in the room, including Joe--our UT professor who taught us in Brazil, burst out laughing.  It was a classic, albeit odd, Jessica entrance.  Jason's photos blew everyone else's out of the water.  They are, hands down, the most beautiful photographs I have ever laid eyes on.  He processed them in slide form, which brought out colors that I didn't even realize existed.  Seriously--I was with him when he took many of the pictures in Brazil, and the photos look better than the actual reality did.  He should seriously consider a career with National Geographic.  Other than the above described Brazilian festa, my weekend was relatively boring.  I did what I usually do-study.  I have one more Oceanography exam to take at ACC, then I'm done with that blasted course.  Stupid science requirements.    I really, really, need to work on my thesis this week.  I swear I'm almost done...

My arm still really hurts, I've been nauseous all day, and generally felt rather blah.  The exciting news is that I finally ordered my cap, gown, and invitations for graduation. It's finally happening...can't believe it. I just need to take one more test for Oceanography at ACC, write about 10 more pages for the thesis over Thanksgiving, and I'm DONE. It won't fully hit me until December 5th, I'm sure.  Then the ironic thing is that 5 days after I graduate, I have to take a final. Ha! Stupid, rediculous graduation dates.

						   Mood: Excited :-D  Yá. Se acabó. My study abroad grades are FINALLY processed!!! No, I'm serious this time. I have a new degree audit and everything. After being shuffled around between 3 departments all over campus for over a year, my grades from Cuba have at long last been processed into their proper place for my degree requirements. Liberal Arts had to do a few over-rides, but in the end I was shocked at how amazingly simple it was to fix this mess. Took about 20 minutes. Why the heck didn't Liberal Arts do this earlier?! I've been there God knows how many times, and they would just send me back to study abroad, or to Latin American Studies, who would then send me back to Liberal Arts, back to study abroad, ect ect ect. I felt like UT was playing ping-pong with me.  Heather, who does credit processing over at study abroad, had to call the Dean's office and speak with the person responsible for issuing degrees. She did that last week, but had to put her foot down again today and call the office again and DEMAND that someone rectify this situation ASAP--there have been people who didn't graduate on time as a result of this bureaucratic bs. I was determined not to be one of those people.  I don't think there has been ANYONE who has had to deal with more bureaucratic red tape as I have in college. Try me. Try having one of your study abroad grades lost, stuck in the Atlantic for a year. Try having 3 departments fighting over whether or not you get credit for those study abroad courses. Try having the GRE people lose your application and money. Try having the Services for Students with Disabilities demand that you have your psychiatrist re-write a letter verifying your disability. 3 times. Try running around campus getting Fulbright signatures at the last minute, with professors in 3 different departments, when they told you in the beginning it wasn't necessary. Try arguing with Latin American Studies that it's stupid to require that the 1st reader of your honors undergraduate thesis be in the department of your "concentration", regardless of what you're actually writing about. Try having UT fail to inform you until the last minute that you can't be enrolled at ACC the semester that you plan to graduate, despite the fact that every advisor and their dog in Liberal Arts knew that you still needed to finish the ACC science credits your last semester. Try running between Liberal Arts and the Rio Grande campus at ACC, b/c in order for ACC to release a "request form for an early grade release", they need a letter from Liberal Arts verifying that I am indeed graduating in December. Try having all this happen in one semester, when you're trying to graduate, taking 15 hours, a thesis class, and a correspondence course. Did I mention I should have died Sunday in a car accident, but didn't?  The next person who comes up to me and tells me that they are stressed is going to get an earful from me.  But. I have persevered.

						    urlLink    Shaky Listening to: The sound of my heart racing 90 miles an hour  I almost died today.  God must want me on earth a little longer, to fulfill His plan and my purpose in life.    I had an accident today, in the exact same place as 2 or 3 years ago--making a left turn off of Barton Springs road onto Lamar.  It was under the same conditions.  It had been raining, and the roads were slick.  Just before that accident a few years ago, I had a premonition that I was going to be in an accident, which made what happened today all the more bizaare.  Anyway, in the previous accident my back tires had caused me to hydroplane and fish-tail out of control, and the car in the right-hand lane hit me on the side.  Today, the exact same thing happened--in the exact same place on the exact same street.  Only this time, there was hardly any traffic (thank God).  I must have over-corrected or something, because not only did I fish-tail, but I accidentally swerved from the far right lane all the way over across the road, over the median, and into oncoming traffic.  Luckily there was hardly any traffic going south on Lamar on the other side of the median, and the guy heading towards me was going slow enough to stop.  They were kind enough to just sit there and wait until I had gained my composure, drove across the street and into a parking lot, and got out of the car and made certain I was OK.  I didn't really realize the magnitude of the situation, or how I wouldn't be sitting here right now if there had been more traffic on the road, or if that median hadn't been there to at least slow me down.  God must really want me to stick around, b/c this isn't the only time I've escaped near-death situations.  The mere act of being born, for one thing--I was 3 months premature and was fed through tubes for 6 weeks before I gained enough weight to even come home from the hospital.  Then there was that time I was getting off work, and some jack-ass ran the red light and almost hit me on the driver's side going 50 miles an hour.  Luckily I hesitated just a few seconds before going at the green light.  Then there was that time in Cuba, when I almost got hit by a live wire that had exploded off of a telephone pole following a hurricane...not to mention the near-misses by crazy, insane Latin American drivers who just will not stop if you're crossing the street...  Note to self: get new tires, and under no circumstances drive at that intersection of Lamar and Barton Springs after it's been raining.  I'm thankful to be alive and sitting here typing this.

						    urlLink    Relieved  I am so glad this week is over--it's been rather hellish.  Too much UT red-tape to deal with.  Oh yeah and I had two midterms this week.  The physical anthropology one on Monday was a disaster.  Plane crash with no survivors.  I have no idea what I made yet, but at this point I'm hoping that I simply passed.  There goes any hopes for getting an A in that class.  I just took my Latin American politics exam, but I don't want to jinks anything by evaluating whether or not I did well enough.  I don't know about anyone else, but every time I walk out of an exam feeling great and exclaiming, "Wow!  That went very well", it always turns out worse than I expected.  If I don't say anything, it's always better than I expected.  One thing I will say, though: I'm sure glad I did a little extra reading last night.  For the long essay part of the test (there are five "short" answers and one long essay) Dietz was pretty specific: choose 2 case studies, one in which democracy has worked well over the long term (at least 10 years), and another case where democracy has failed.  Explain why, ect. ect.  The kicker was that he had a side note: one case study has to be from the book but NOT discussed in class; the other case had to have been discussed in class, but not in the book.  Tricky.  I chose Costa Rica and Venezuela.  About half a dozen people came up to him during the exam a little flustered an confused.  That's right folks--you have to attend all lectures AND read the mountain of material.  Trick-y.  Vicente Fox is in town today.  I wasn't sure if he was actually going to make it or not--with heads of state you never know, really.  I'm thinking about heading over to the Union later to watch his speech on the big screen.  I wonder if he'll talk about NAFTA or FTAA.  I've gotta work on finishing up my thesis tomorrow.  Sólo me falta como diez páginas.  Oh!  I forgot to mention~ Halloween ruled.  Jessica's party was great--I was Fidel Castro, and she borrowed my costume to be Carmen Miranda.  It was much fun--good beer and an excellent Cuban cigar ;-) (I had to be authentic!)

						    urlLink    Devastated  We have Brandi's final prognosis.  It was as we expected, and even worse.  She has a grade IV + Glioblastoma brain tumor that is rapidly spreading; the oncologist has given her six months to live.  If you are not familiar with this type of tumor, go  here .  It is the most malignant of all primary brain tumors.  Brandi will fight this, because she is strong--and she has hundreds of people praying for her.  When her sister Jamie has to go back to work, I am moving in with Brandi on a semi-permanent basis in order to watch over her and make sure she doesn't have to endure radiation therapy alone.  If all goes well today, she should be released and will head on back to East Bernard.  It's funny how everything else seems superflous--any other minor complaints or inconveniences.  Our family already had an eye-opener when Uncle Ronnie died, but this again shows us just how fleeting and precious life is.  If Brandi lives 6 months or 6 years, we are going to make every day the best it can possibly be.

						   Things are not looking very good at all.  Brandi's surgery really accomplished nothing; they removed very little of the tumor--only enough for a biopsy; it was not encapsulated, and was already spreading so much into her temporal lobe that it was nearly impossible to distinguish normal brain tissue from tumor tissue, and removing the "whole thing" would have left her paralyzed and without the ability to speak.  Other than a general siezure last night and headaches, she should be recovering well from the actual surgery.  We won't know the final prognosis for another couple of days, when the pathology report comes back.  But when your neurosurgeon comes in and says, "Let's all have a prayer--we need a miracle"...that's not good.  Bottom line is that she (the surgeon) wanted to prepare us for the worst-case scenario.  I appreciate that, but at the same time it is quite difficult.  We're not going to mention any of the gory details to her until she's more recovered and we have the final pathology report.  I'm assuming that her oncologist will discuss the final prognosis with her.  I really want to be with her there when that happens, so I'll probably be back in Houston or in the general vicinity by the end of the week.  The good news (if there is any to come out of this) is that she has a fantastic support group--hundreds of people have visited her within the last week.  She will not be without people who love her very much to help get her through this ordeal, and I know that she's a strong person with alot of faith.  When it's all said and done, she's got it covered--either here on earth with her friends and family or in heaven with her daddy.   But she is very scared, and needs all the prayers that she can get.  Today is Brandi's birthday.  She is 23 years old.

I had Bible study for awhile, which helped quite a bit.   The doctors are saying that the tumor is more than likely malignant, because it's already spread into her temporal lobe area.  Not good.  I'm going to go try and eat something.

						    urlLink    Terrible  Worst Christmas ever.  My family has the worst lucky, really.  My grandparents and I drove down to see my aunt and two cousins in East Bernard (about 60 miles west of Houston), only to find out that my younger cousin Brandi (22, about to turn 23 on the 30th) was in the hospital.  She has had numerous migraine headaches since August, and I had assumed they were due to the enormous stress she's been under with her job; she teaches 21 4th graders in a very low-income area outside of College Station, and she had no break between graduating and the start of her new job.  To our horror, they acutally weren't migraines at all, and they were not due to stress; the CAT scan she had showed an "abnormality" of somesort, along with possible fluid around the brain.  Her MRI clearly showed the reason--some sort of mass or tumor at least the size of a walnut on the left side of her head.  What makes this entire situation inexcusable is that her father, my uncle, died two years ago of a massive heart attack.  It is far too much for our family to be handling right now.  What scares me most is not so much the idea of her having brain surgery, which is already terrifying, but the inconclusiveness regarding the actual tumor.  She is a 22 year old girl--people that age never have random brain tumors!  We can only hope and pray to God that it's not canerous, which would more or less be a death sentence.   So this year Christmas sucks.  Christmas was a miracle day...so I'm praying for another miracle; we need it.

						    urlLink    Inspired  Today is the official graduation day for UT (no public ceremonies).  I actually almost didn't make it, due once again to a UT screw-up.  You see, I took an undergraduate honors course over two semesters; the spring 2003, and this past fall.  The grade was supposed to be carried over to both semesters, with an incomplete for the spring that was supposed to be changed by this past thursday.  The problem was that my professor turned in a grade for this semester, but forgot to turn in the grade for last semester.  As a result, that incomplete turned into an F.  I checked my grades on Thursday night, and was quite hysterical for at least 20 minutes.  For obvious reasons, I didn't get much sleep that night.  I called the registrar, Liberal Arts, and Latin American Studies at 8:00am, trying to figure out what the hell was going on.  Apparently my prof had indeed forgotten to turn in the grade, and he alone would have to fill out a grade change form.  Of course nobody knew where he was, myself inluded.  Luckily, Anne Dibble over at Latin American Studies called the prof at home and had him physically come up to campus to fill out the form.  I breathed a huge sigh of relief when I re-checked my grades Friday night, and discovered that everything had gone through.  So.  It's all done now--everything.  I can officially say that there's a green light to graduate.  And I'll be looking for that diploma in the mail.  Today I saw Return of the King for the second time.  Still just as good the second time, but I think I'll wait awhile before I see it again--it's very emotional and almost too much to handle.  It's always nice, though, to catch the little things that you may have missed before, or to re-examine certain very powerful moments in the film.  Did anyone else get chills down their spine during the scene at the Black Gate when Aragorn and crew are standing there facing the last group of 10,000 orcs, with Sauron's Eye staring at them?  I imagine that it would be like staring the devil in the face.  Not exactly the most comforting prospect.  I'd have to say, though, that my favorite moment was when Eowyn killed the Witch King, threw off her helmet, and yelled, "I AM NO MAN!"  She rules.  If I have a daughter, I'm naming her Eowyn.  I need to go study for the GRE now.  Bleh.

						    urlLink    Overwhelmed  Well.  The Return of the King was, without a doubt, the best movie-going experience I have ever had in my entire existence.  A cinemagraphic feast for the eyes.  You thought the Battle of Helms Deep was intense?  A trivial quarrel compared to Minas Tirith and Pelanor Fields.  I mean, I thought that The Two Towers was even better than the first movie of the Trilogy, but this...blew the other two out of the water.  The entire audience should have cooperatively invested in boxes of tissues, this movie was so emotionally intense.  Around the middle of the film half a dozen people that were sitting in front of me were leaning forward in their seats (myself included), biting fingernails with mouths dropping about every 3 minutes.  Even the guys were sniffling.  I'd be shocked to Mordor and back if this doesn't get an Oscar, or at least nominated.  I'll be putting up a film review on my new website pretty soon.  (http://www.geocities.com/rosariotc@sbcglobal.net/) And I'm going to see it again this weekend--and this time I'm bringing tissues.

The entire trilogy (aside from being based on Tolkien, one of the greatest writers of all time) has made cinemagraphic and film history. The amount of work, money, time, and people involved in filming these movies is astounding.  Ok enough rambling about the movie. (But I'm not ready for the Journey to be over!)

						    urlLink    Thrilled Watching: CNN  When I came downstairs after waking up, I was floored when my grandmother said, "They've captured Saddam."  My mouth dropped; I was in total shock.  I replied, "But are they sure that it's him?"  She assured me that they were positive; they had run DNA tests shortly after his capture.  Another shocking thing about this already shocking scenario is that he didn't put up a fight, when he had sworn all along that he would.  Obviously he was outnumbered by our 4th Infantry Devision (THOSE ARE OUR BOYS!!!  FROM TEXAS!!! :-D).  Still, I am suprised that he didn't shoot himself rather than be handed over to the authorities.  I am thrilled for the Iraqi people; this is indeed a victory against terrorism, and perhaps now--maybe not immediately, but in the long run--some stability will develop in the region.  As Bush so eloquently put it (THAT'S a first; eloquence from our President?), "He will face justice he denied to millions."  I truly hope, though, that we turn him over to the Iraqi people; in the end, that would be the most just scenario.    All that being said, let me make something perfectly clear: simply because we've captured Saddam, does not mean that the way in which we more or less unilaterally went to war was acceptable.  I still to this day do not approve of the way we went in; I have always been very wary of U.S. unilateral military intervention.  It is NOT an appropriate way to handle foreign policy.  What right does the U.S. and Great Britain have to conduct their own personal foreign policy?  And futhermore--simply because you were not in favor of the war effort does not mean that you can't be happy that Saddam is captured; I thought that Lieberman's statement against Dean today was quite nasty and unfounded; what did he mean by "Dean in the end was hoping that Saddam was still in power"?  Again, I will reiterate: simply because Dean did not approve of the means by which we went to war, does not give Lieberman the right to assume that those against the war effort were in favor of Saddam.  THAT is an argument that Bush was making--that whole "you are either with us or you are for the terrorists" bull shit.     We need to bear in mind through this entire process that democracy is NOT an export commodity~ simply because it works well here does not constitute a simple transplant of that system elsewhere.  While I feel (and would sincerely hope) that our government's intentions were genuine in the matter of freeing the Iraqi people, it is important to remember that "going at it on your own" has consequences.  We can't pragmatically expect the Iraqis to have a newly written constitution in place by the spring, either--these things take time.  That being said, we most definitely need to make plans to remove our troops from the region sooner rather than later; the Iraqi people will only tolerate our presence for so long.  While I have provided my 2 cents on the matter, I do feel that celebration is most definitely in order.

I simply can't understand Texas weather; one minute it's 29 degrees, the next it's 65.  It's as if our particular climate can't make up its damn mind.  I bought advanced tickets for The Return of the King~ Wednesday at 12:30pm :-D  I am so excited about this third and last movie!!!  ::jumps up and down::  I can't wait to finish the Tolkein books over the holidays...  I'm off to go take a hot shower, drink hot chocolate, and admire the Christmas tree.

						    urlLink    Peaceful  The Return of the King soundtrack is probably one of the most beautiful compilations I've ever heard.  I cannot even begin to imagine how powerful this 3rd movie is going to be; if the music behind the film makes my mouth drop and gives me goosebumps, I'm terrified of just how amazing the last movie in the Trilogy is going to be.  By the way: you can hear both Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen on the soundtrack ;-)  I'm taking a much-needed break from studying for my Latin American politics final mañana.  Thank God it's my only one.  Did I mention how stupid it is to take a final after you've graduated?!  I think I'll write a letter to the editor of the Daily Texan and complain.  Ok, back to studying.

						    urlLink    Hap  I feel much better today--probably due to the fact that I got enough sleep. It still feels quite awkward, though, to be studying for a final after I've graduated. Makes absolutely no sense, really. Why doesn't UT simply have graduation ceremonies on the 19th or the 20th, after Seniors are finished with finals? It's kind of difficult to be motivated enough to study when you've already crossed the finish line.  Aaron and Maggie and I studied at Metro this evening. Well...we technically talked more than we studied. ;-) It was nice. They assured me that we would go out and truly celebrate 6th-stree style after finals were over. Sounds good to me--it's high time I took a break.  Hey everybody--the Tower is lit up orange with an '03' on the sides! For some reason I'm monumentally excited about that. They didn't light the tower for me personally, of course, but it feels that way. The whole thing is rather bittersweet, because I doubt I'll be attending UT as a grad student. I still am in shock mode; I can't believe that I have a college degree. I just didn't expect it all to go by so fast! It's a scary thought.  I better go study for my final on Wednesday. Again, this is stupid.

						    urlLink    Weird Watching: SNL  Well...it's (more or less) official.  I've graduated from the University of Texas.  Except, I have to take a final next week, and my actual degree won't be mailed to me until early February.  Oh well.  For all intents and purposes, I'm finally done with the undergraduate scene.  The ceremony was nice...and crazy at the same time.  KINKY FRIEDMAN was our guest speaker!  It was most definitely a break from the norm of speaches.  He was hilarious!  Only in Austin, TX would you have something like that at a graduation.  My proudest moment during the ceremony: when the Dean of Liberal Arts said, "I would like to congratulate and present to you...the Class of 2003." :-D Yay for graduating in 3 years!!!  I can't believe that this chapter of my life is pretty much over.  This morning I woke up completely overwhelmed and a bit sad, partially due to nostolgia and mostly due to the fact that many, many of my dearest friends couldn't make it to the ceremony.  I know that it came at a rather terrible time of the year, and that sometimes you can't avoid conflicts in schedule.  But my cousin Brandi, for example--she works full time as a teacher of 21 fourth-grade kids in Bryan, and she managed to take half a day off and drive all the way down here.  I know everyone wanted to be there that couldn't.  It just sucks when like 2 people showed up.  Probably because I know that I would have gone out of my way to go to anyone else's graduation.  Unless I am out of the country or somebody has died, you KNOW I'm going to be there.  But alas, there's no use dwelling on it.  This won't be my last college graduation.  I still have two more to go!  (Masters and a Ph.D. ;-)  It sucks that you have to celebrate graduation by studying.  Blast this final on Wednesday!

						    urlLink    Shocked  Oh. My. Gosh.  Praise the Lord--things are FINALLY looking up.  After 4 months of dealing with GRE bureaucratic red tape, they approved of me having extra time due to my learning disability.  After having my psychiatrist re-write my letter 3 times, jumping over UT hurdles, and calling New Jersey long distance, this nightmare is fianlly over with.  I have no clue how I got a rejection letter a few days ago, when in reality they had already approved my request.  The only thing I can think of is that my final documentation got shuffled around and filed in the wrong place.  Kayte was right: if I've passed UT's bureaucratic mess (which seems to be more difficult than even that of the IRS), there is no reason why I shouldn't pass GRE standards.  AND I also called Tulane Grad School today, and was pleasantly surprised to hear that as long as all the other materials were in with my application (rec letters, main app, transcript, ect.), I could have my GRE scores sent in a little later.  The only thing they would need to know is that they were on the way.  Opa also offered to pay for an extra month of online GRE study.  God bless him.  So now, I have until January 7th to study.  A huge weight has been lifted off of my soldiers.  Prayer really does help.  Now I can relax, and concentrate on GRADUATING IN 3 DAYS!!! :-D

						    urlLink    Annoyed  OK, people: Regardless of whether or not George W. Bush outright lied to the American people regarding Iraq's "stockpiles" of WMD's, we need to seriously take a step back and have a look around.  I happen to personally believe that he did indeed mislead the American people, but perhaps not intentionally; I would maintain that the intelligence community mislead him into truly believing that Iraq was an immediate, they-are-going-to-gas-us-tomorrow threat.  (Even though the Secretary of State denied such an immediate threat 7 months before 9-11 ever happened.)  Regardles...this entire situation makes me very, very nervous.  When the CIA, FBI, NSA, or whatever other 'intelligence' gathering agency is actually having the President of the freaking United States as well as the Prime Minister of Britain truly and honestly believing that Saddam Hussein had piles upon piles of weapons of mass destruction, there's a problem.  RED FLAG, RED FLAG.    "National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice on Thursday became the first senior member of the Bush administration to acknowledge publicly that the data used as the key argument for invading Iraq may have been wrong."--BBC News  The data used may have been wrong.  Ooops!  We single-handedly alienated the international community, watched as 500+ of our soldiers die, and continue to watch them die, seeing as how remnants of Hussein's regime remain in Iraq and continue to fight, not for their former leader, but for their warped version of Allah.  Oops.  If they had an independent council investigating a President's sex life, then they can sure as hell have an independent council investigating our own intelligence gathering forces--and just whether or not Dubya may have lied.  Not about getting a blow job in the oval office, but about issues of national security.  And that slight chance that our own President may have been using what occured on September 11th in order to justify proactively invading a country.  I'm not saying that he did--I'm just saying that maybe, just maybe, it might be a good idea to look into it.  To take a good, hard look at the capabilities (or lack there of, it would seem) of our intelligence gathering forces.  Let me make something perfectly clear to all those who have raised the "humanitarian" argument regarding the ousting of Saddam.  He is a horrible man, and I'm very happy that he's in custody.  But the War in Iraq was not sold to us on the basis of humanitarian need, though Bush would now say otherwise.  Our President looked right at the camera and assured the American people that we were going into Iraq because Saddam Hussein posed an immediate threat to us, which he did not.  And I'm not buying any of that "oh, but he would have posed a threat to us at some point..." argument.  That's not what he said.  He said that Saddam Hussein had "stockpiles" of weapons of mass destruction (now he admits that perhaps there were only 'programs' in operation) and that he posed an immediate threat.  As in, if we don't get rid of him now, he's going to run over to Bin Laden and purchase a nuclear weapon (which is complete bull shit; if Saddam wanted to buy a nuke, he would go to the Saudis or North Korea to do that).  Furthermore, Bush had the gaul to draw a connection between 9-11 and Hussein, only to rebuke that connection later when he realized there was none.  He flat out made all of the families of the 9-11 victims, not to mention 80% of the American people and all of our boys over in the mid-east, truly believe that the war in Iraq started on September 12th, 2001.  I would love to see democracy spread in Iraq and in neighboring nations.  I am glad that Hussein no longer has rein over the Iraqi people.  But dammit, let's make sure that the next time we decide to invade a country, we have our facts straight.

						    urlLink    Cheerful  I just got back from Aaron's place.  Heth tho sweet--he burned me a bunch of cd's .  I'm jealous of his XBox.  The last time I was over there, I played the Lord of the Rings game for so long that my carpel tunnel syndrome re-developed.  I got my diploma through the mail this weekend .  I felt certain that UT would screw up once again, and do something monumentally stupid like mail it to the wrong address.  I almost didn't get my diploma because, once again, somebody wasn't doing their job.  Oh well--it's over now.  It feels so odd to really and truly be done; I feel as if I should be working on something, but I'm officially done!  I've graduated, taken the GRE, and applied to my graduate schools.  (UT and Tulane)  It feels awkward being around campus with everyone else still in school.  Not that I'm complaining; it just feels odd.  My grandparents and I spent several days with Brandi, and it was wonderful to see her again--this time in much better spirits; the last time we saw her, she was in ICU shortly after surgery.  All of us feel very confident in this upcoming surgery, because she's having the most qualified neurosurgeon in the country operate on her.  Plus, it's not like we really have any other option at this point; she can't start radiation, because radiation is supposed to cause expansion in the brain.  She has no room for expansion, due to the fact that the tumor in her head is 5 inches long and 2 inches thick.  Brandi has an unbelievable support group; hundreds of people have been in and out of her house in the past month; the people of this small town in the middle of nowhere outside of Houston have offered to help her with bills, drive her around, pay her mother's insurence, and cook and clean for her.  Brandi has received get-well cards from around the world, many from people that she doesn't even know.  A few days ago the father of one of their friends died, and he requested that in lieu of flowers, all gifts be made to the Brandi Ward Fund.  On the 11th of February, East Bernard is going to have a raffel dinner for her, and the've already sold over 600 tickets.  It's times like these when the pure selflessness of human nature does appear; this weekend we all caught my very cynical grandmother uttering the words, "You know...people are basically good at heart."  This coming from someone who gave up on the human race long ago.  It's as if God took a very tragic situation and molded it to His purpose; He knows that this family has suffered so much, and is now providing Brandi with everything that she possibly needs to get through this ordeal.  And she will--Brandi has vowed that she will not go down without a fight.  Besides...she's too fiesty and hard-headed .  This entire thing reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from the Scriptures:  "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose." ~Romans 8:28  Amen.  On that note...I better head on to bed.  I seriously need to get my sleep schedule back on track.  I keep saying that I'm going to, but I always end up sleeping during the day and staying up all night.  We need schedules for night people!

						    urlLink    Hopeful  "There is still hope." ~Arwen, The Lord of the Rings  Indeed.  We have some very good news about Brandi: her 2nd surgery is scheduled for Wednesday, February 4th, with Dr. Raymond Sawaya--one of the top neurosurgeon's in the country.  Her entire surgical team, in fact (anesthesiologist included) is the best of the best.  It's terrible that all this has happened to Brandi, but we can feel confident that she is in very good hands.  Her surgeon feels quite certain that he can remove a significant portion of the tumor without damaging any critical areas, which was the first surprise we heard.  The second was that he "was not unequivocally convinced" that the tumor was a grade 4 Glioblastoma; rather, he feels that it actually might be a lower grade in malignancy, and that it could have been in her head for 10 years or more.  (This would be a good scenario; the lower the malignancy, the slower a tumor grows)  The 3rd surprise was the kicker; in discussing all this with Brandi and her mother, Dr. Sawaya said something along the lines of "Now a few years down the road you'll probably have to have surgery again, because these tumors do have a tendency to re-appear."  Everyone was like, "A few years down the road?!  I thought we were talking in terms of months, not years..."  So bottom line, we're all feeling much more hopeful.  And Brandi's case simply illustrates the power of prayer!  To quote one of my aunt's friends regarding these strange turn of events: "It's not odd...it's GOD!!!"

						    urlLink    Tired  Today's e-mail from my Aunt on Brandi:  Dr. Yung at M. D. Anderson feels more surgery is a must in Brandi’s case before radiation treatment.  Her tumor is just too big.  While it is not the answer we would have liked to have heard, we feel God led us in this direction as the only recourse to rid Brandi once and for all of the cancer that is raging in her head.  She is scheduled to meet with Dr. Raymond Sawaya, Chairman of the Neurosurgery Dept at M. D. Anderson on Thursday.  Again my Brandi has gotten the best of the best to be her surgeon.  Surgery should be scheduled for next week.  Dr. Yung has the utmost confidence that they can remove some of the tumor without damaging her speech or motor skills.  We have to put our faith in God and the skills he has given the doctors that she will come out of this surgery as well as she came out of the last surgery.  One positive note is that the pathologists at M. D. Anderson are still questioning whether her tumor is a Glioblastoma or whether it might be a lower grade.  That could be a good thing because given the prognosis….a lower grade of cancer would have better results.   My Brandi’s spirits are still great.  She is ready to fight this monster and WIN.  Keep her in your prayers.  ~~~~~~ So overall, we're pretty hopeful.  I believe that this is good news; while undergoing another surgery will of course be stressful, Brandi's prognosis might be a lot better if they can at least remove some of the tumor.  Perhaps things will look up from here.  On a happier note (though certainly a bizaare one)...I'm sure that everybody and their dog has heard Dean's caucus speech by now.  What in the world was the man thinking?!  He seriously needs to calm down a bit.  Take it down a notch, man.  Take it down a notch.  I was very sad to see Gephardt go. :-( He was, without a doubt, one of the kindest and most genuine men that the U.S. legislature has ever been blessed to have.  Not a spot on his record, and he truly gave a damn.  Here is a piece of the final address he gave to his supporters:  "I'm going to return to Congress, and dedicate my last remaining year to representing them with the best of my ability.  Every day of my working life I've sought to bring positive change to the hard working men and women of this country, and my efforts will not cease in these final months.  "I will continue to work for universal healthcare, pension reform, more teachers in the classroom, energy independence from Persian Gulf oil, and a trade policy that doesn't sacrifice American jobs in pursuit of trade with countries that have no respect for the environment, or the living conditions of their own people.  American workers can't compete with that, and they shouldn't have to.  "I'm proud of the campaign we waged.  It was fought on the principles of fairness for our workers, security for our seniors, and opportunity for our children.  My career in public office is coming to an end, but the fight is never over.  "All of you who have dedicated so many months and years to this effort, I hope and pray that you will stay in the arena of public life.  Never stop fighting for what you believe in and never stop believing that we can make a difference.  The towering strength of America is its endless reservoir of citizens who never tire of the sacrifice to make it better.  "I love this country and I love my family.  The silver lining in all of this, is that I'll finally get to see them, at every opportunity, rather than when opportunities could be found.  Jane, Matt, Chrissy and Kate are my life.  And to them I'll always be grateful.  God bless you all."  I just recently found out that when his son was 2 years old, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Due to an experimental treatment, however, his son is alive and well today.  I think I'll write him a letter inquiring about the treatment.  Dammit, he would have made a good President.  Oh well.  As long as Bush gets beat, I'll be alright with whomever wins the nomination.

If you're truly bored and feel like reading it, go  here .  An update on my cousin (I'm seriously considering adding a page to my website, dedicated to her and her ongoing battle with cancer): there was yet another delay at MD Anderson, but a final appointment has been re-scheduled with one Dr. Yung on Tuesday--who just happens to be one of the top neurosurgeons in the country.  Our family feels confident now knowing that Brandi literally could not be in better hands.  If, after doing everything that is humanly possible, God does indeed decide to take her, we will at least know that we did everything that was in our power to keep her around.  Over and out.

						    urlLink    Blah Watching: The Godfather, Part II  An update on Brandi: she went to MD Anderson today to have another MRI, but won't see her next doctor until Thursday for a second opinion on the pathology report.  I had no idea that MD Anderson was the #1 cancer treatment center in America, but I'm very glad that Brandi will be having her treatments there.  She is most definitely in good hands.  I'm praying for a miracle, like a completely different diagnosis.  Not likely, but who knows.  I bought my plane ticket today to visit Mildred in Boston over her spring break, and I'm very excited about it.  I hope that Brandi will be doing OK by then.  She is in good spirits now, and feels fine; but I know that will all change when she begins her radiation and chemo.  I'm just going to try to spend as much time as I can down there with her.  In the meantime, UT's grad application is due Thursday, and Tulane's is due February 1st.  I still need to tweak my proposal statement, which I'm planning on doing tomorrow.  I also need to drop by campus to a) turn in a library book, and b) hand in my check for the Student ILASSA conference in February.  Hopefully I can see Sarah sometime tomorrow also, because she's leaving for Brazil on Thursday and won't be back until June or July.

						    urlLink    Relieved  So I was pleasantly surprised by my GRE scores today--620 on the verbal and 510 on the math!  I am so relieved, because I had feared that due to time constraints and our recent family emergency, I would not do well on the exam.  Plus, I didn't sleep at all last night.  Not one hour.  Nervousness about my impending date with destiny kept me awake every hour on the hour until I got up at a quarter til seven.  I must have taken that test running on pure adrenaline.  I am so happy and relieved now; this is one less burden I have to carry, and I can rest assured that I have a very decent shot at getting into my top grad school choices with my GRE score in conjunction with my GPA.  This day was bittersweet.  Brandi had her 40+ staples removed, and has an appointment at MD Anderson next week for another opinion about her prognosis.  Unfortunately, I'm not expecting this 3rd opinion to be any different from the first two.  Brandi also asked her neurosurgeon an unexpected question: she wanted to know exactly how she was going to die.  This question is actually very in line with her character--she is a very optimistic person, but she is also realistic (and stubborn sometimes, too ;-).  Some people in this situation refuse to believe that they are going to die; Brandi knows that she is, and that it will be soon--but by the same token she has a solid faith by which to stand upon and face the inevitable.  The way I see it, she wants to know exactly what kind of situation to expect.  I don't want to get into the gory details, but basically with malignant brain tumors, the brain eventually just shuts down.  "The body cannot live without the mind", as Morpheus said from The Matrix.  The good news from all of this (if one could actually view it as good) is that her ultimate end should be peaceful; she'll eventually slip into a coma.  That was hard to write.  But more and more, as I turn to the Bible for some comfort, I am realizing in my heart that death is but one path that we all must take.  Even burying her is not the end game, because I trust in the Lord enough to know that we will meet again--in a different time and place, when all the evil, tears, and sorrow of this world have passed and all that is left is the good.  We will meet again.  But not yet.

						    urlLink    Nervous Listening to:  Into the West, Return of the King soundtrack  "Hope fades Into the world of night Through shadows falling Out of memory and time. Don't say 'We have come now to the end' White shores are calling You and I will meet again. And you'll be here in my arms, Just sleeping  The ships have come to carry you home..."  Such a beautiful song.  I cried when I first heard it, and hearing it now is even more emotional for me, because the lyrics make me think of Brandi.  I take the GRE on Tuesday, and needless to say, I'm freaking out.  Whether or not I have a substantial, logical reason to be worried is beside the point; I believe that one must be in the right frame of mind to take these standardized tests, particulary since I need to get a decent score to be admitted into my top graduate school choices.  And I am definitely not in the right mindset; all I can think about, nearly every moment of the day, is how truly ephemeral life is.   Everything I do, hear, or speak of seems superflous to the overwhelming feeling of sorrow and gut-wrenching pain that I feel in my heart.  Stupid, silly standardized examinations, along with every other complaint or inconvenience in existence at the moment, seem  trite and not worth my time or energy.  How can I possibly worry about a pointless exam that won't truly test my knowledge anyway if I'd rather be spending my waking moments with my dying cousin who might as well be my sister?  I need Tuesday to be over and done with.  I don't care about my score, nor do I really care whether or not I end up in Graduate School in August, because Brandi might not even make it to August.  What's the point?  I'd rather be fighting this battle with her than worrying about what I make on the damn quatitative section of the GRE that reflects nothing of my degree knowledge.  I'm not apathetic, I'm just angry that the GRE ass holes wouldn't let me re-schedule the exam for a week later.  I don't give a rat's ass about their stupid "you should have called a week in advance to change the date of the exam" policy; how was I supposed to know that I would need to reschedule while running back and forth between here, Houston, and East Bernard, watching over a cousin with a brain tumor diagnosed on Chrismas Eve?  So now you can't have an emergency?  I'm going to try and get some sleep; I've got to get my sleep schedule back on track, since I have to take this bloody test at 9am on Tuesday.  Wish me luck--I'll need it.

						   Feeling:  The Holy Spirit   This was my response to someone's comments on the Passion of the Christ film:  There are two main responses to this film: one is seeing Christ being murdered for 2 hours, and brutally so.  The other response is the way I see it--Christ giving his life, freely, for humanity.    From Matthew 26:53, when Jesus calls upon Peter to put down his sword:  "Do you think I cannot call upon my Father, and He will at once put at my disposal more than 12 legions of angels?  But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?"  I did walk out of that movie a stronger Christian; it truly solidified my faith.  I do not hate the Jews or the Romans for crucifying Jesus, because Christ was not killed; he gave his life freely, knowing his fate and how brutal his death would be.  It doesn't matter who nailed him to the Cross--whether it be the Jews, the Romans, the Egyptians...it doesn't matter.  This debate, while certainly worthwhile, deeply saddens me because we're missing the entire point.  You are right--the movie was about his death.  There have been many films made about his life, but this film was made to illustrate not the hatred surrounding those who crucified Him, but Christ's ultimate sacrifice.  God's sacrifice.  Our Heavenly Father knew what had to be done, though in human form he also knew how brutal this death would be.  But He could have not taken the cup that contained His fate; He could have just as easily stopped the soldiers from arresting him, or called upon thousands of angels to come to earth to avenge his suffering.  But He didn't, because he knew what it would take to save humanity.  This film was very difficult to watch, because of the brutality.  But as I watched the Romans ruthlessly whipping his flesh apart, did I hate them?  Did I hate the mob encouraging His death?  No, because all of this had to come to pass.  And clearly one saw that those who were mocking him, beating him, and seeming all the while to enjoy it...you also saw Satan, weaving his way through the crowd.  Do not think that those bringing about the Lord's death were acting simply of their own accord, for the devil wanted nothing more than to torment God enough to the point that He would give in and not fulfill His plan.  Thankfully, He did not give in.  If I were, for a moment, to think about whichever group actually brought about His death, it would be idiotic to assume that those same group of people are the same as those today.  But I don't because it's futile; it's not one group or sect who 'killed' Him.  Technically, it was humanity as a whole through sin.  But since God willingly got up on the Cross, He took sin onto himself so that it may be washed from us.  "Little about the good that he has done - just the bad that was done through his death..."  But you see, that's just it; there was no bad that was done through His death.  Nothing but good came out of that.  While God suffered more than any human has or ever will on this earth, what He (and we) gained out of that suffering is incomparable.  'When at last you understand The grace by death He gave to us All else shade fade All else returns to dust'

						    urlLink    Overwhelmed  Praise God.  The Passion was a life-changing film, and I felt that it most definitely did the Scriptures justice.    "You are my friends, and the greatest love a person can have for his friends is to give his life for them."  After seeing the film, I turned right to these Scriptures:  Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say?  'Father, save me from this hour?'  No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.--John, 12:27  Who do you think you are?  Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.  Though you do not know him, I know him.  If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.  Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."  "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I AM!" -John 8: 54-58  Lord, Thy will be done.

						    urlLink    Pensive  I was thinking last night about the magnitude of things that have happened to me within the last 2 years.  I have undergone numerous life-altering experiences, and all have profoundly affected my academic, personal, and spiritual life.    **The discussion below is rather long-winded and detailed, so unless you're bored or truly would like to know about the spiritual battle I've gone through, go ahead and stop reading here.**  In light of the upcoming Ash Wednesday, I am realizing that I am closer to God than I have ever been.  The frightening part is that it took being furthest away from Him and experiencing a completely different religion and spiritual ideology in order to finally be brought back.  I consider myself to be a pretty open-minded person, so I tend to shy away from labeling one particular sect or group as "influenced by demonic forces".  It's difficult for us as humans to label what is evil and what is not.  But I truly believe in this quotation: "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."  For 22 years I didn't want to believe in the existence of Hell, because I wanted to erroneously convince myself that a loving God would not send anyone to such a place.  I have now come to understand that such a place does indeed exist, but it is the result of God giving us free will; He cannot force humanity to love him, becuause then it wouldn't be love; it would be something else altogether.  Horrible, evil things exist in this world, but not because God would will it so; but becuase humans fell from grace.  That being said, God has used that to everyone's advantage and given us the possibility to freely return.  Cuban Santeria and Brazilian Candomble are incredibly fascinating sects of the African diaspora, and have influenced the course of Afro-Latin history.  It has been a pleausre to study them in the academic realm, but (as I tend to often do), I inadvertently became too personally involved.  You see, as much as Brazilians or Cubans will try to say that "Oh, there's no problem, no conflict; we mix African religion with Christianity all the time"--there IS a conflict; the African ideology maintains that there is no sin, that it is a social construct that we humans design from birth on.  They don't believe in Hell.  It was so easy, so comfortable for me to go that route, because is it easy for anyone to say "Christ is the only way to Heaven.  He is both the Son of God and God manifestated in the flesh.  No one reaches Heaven except through Him."?  I so desperately wanted to believe that there were multiple ways to paradise, that God works through multiple pathways.  I have come to fully comprehend, to understand, that that is simply not the case.  My problem all along was that I was blindly accpeting some pretty fundamental principles of Christianity without truly understanding them.    Some might say that it's dangerous to question those principles, but it is by questioning them that I came to understand them.  The issue really isn't so much if you question, but where.  I was obviously looking in the wrong place and asking the wrong people; I honestly didn't know this at the time, but God considers it an abonimation to seek answers through "mediators", "seers", or those who may or may not have the ability to tell you about your future.  There is only one mediator between us and God, and He died on the Cross.    The tip-off, the red flag, was the hour or so long disussion I had with the Brazilian Candomble priest in Sao Paulo sometime last July.  He flat-out asked me: "If you are made in the image of God, what makes Christ any different from you?"  He openly acknowledged the contradiction between his line of reasoning and the Bible, but he was using quotes from the scriptures to illustrate his points.  I look back on that and a chill goes down my spine; unbenownst to me, I was basically having an argument with the devil.  Not to say this man himself was evil; I don't believe that.  But it's obvious to me now who was working through him.  And to think that abomidable creature was so close to having me convert to a different religion.  The bastard doesn't hook people by having them worship him directly; he gets them by having them leave Christ indirectly--through doubt, miscommunication, and misunderstanding.  During that conversation I knew in my heart that he was wrong, that Christ was different from me.  But partly due to the language barrier, I didn't know how to explain it.  But it was mostly because I didn't understand it.  Now I do understand it, and a life-time of thank You's could never possibly be enough.  How else could one possibly explain it?  I had the Holy Spirit working through me, to bring me back.  "Back" in a relative sense, because while my heart has always been where it's supposed to be, my mind has been elsewhere.  Now they're both in sink.  And knowing now that my cousin Brandi is going to live, that she's been given a second chance, only further solidifies my faith.  How could you possibly explain all THAT?  Going from a 6-months-to-live prognosis to "Just kidding--it's not even cancerous!"  God performed a miracle.  It's a simple as that.  Perhaps I should write a book.

						    urlLink    Calm  Brandi is very frustrated right now.  As a result of her brain surgeries, she has temporarily lost her reading comprehension abilities.  Also, she can look at an object-- like a pair of scissors--and know what they are, but not be able to say the word "scissors".  You know that feeling you'll have occasionally when you just know you know something, and it's on the tip of your tongue?  Well, that's the sensation she has, except all the time.  Her neurosurgeon has assured her that with several months of speech and reading therapy, she'll be able to return to teaching in the fall.  Which is fantastic news.  So she'll probably be going in to MD Anderson 2 times a week for that, and about 2 months from now they are going to evaluate whether or not she should have radiation therapy to remove the remaining 10% of the tumor.  As soon as Aunt Rite goes back to work, I plan on going down to East Bernard and staying with her the first week or so, just so she won't be so frustrated and alone.  We're still all in a state of shock, but we thank God every day for the miracle that He's given us.  It is obvious that He wants her here on earth for a greater purpose.  Trials like these make you realize how ephemeral and fleeting life truly is.

						    urlLink    Jubilant  If this isn't an example of a miracle, I don't know what is.  Aunt Rite just called, informing us about their trip to MD Anderson today to discuss pathology results with Dr. Sawaya.  Apparently...either somebody somewhere made a monumental mistake, or God is using Brandi as His own personal miracle case study next to Christ; the pathology report came back and, to everyone's dismay, states that Brandi's tumor is actually BENIGN.  Dr. Sawaya mentioned before Brandi's 2nd surgery that he felt that the tumor had been growing in her head for 10 years, which would indicate that it was of a lesser malignant grade.  But benign?!  The director of neurosurgery at MD Anderson, the top cancer center in the world, is truly baffled--he said he's never seen anything like this.  Should definitely go down in the books as a rare case indeed.  I would maintain that this is of course God performing a miracle, and that perhaps He may have used that siempre viva lotion from Cuba that I gave to Brandi as a means by which to cure her.  Let me back-track slightly, for those of you who aren't familiar with the lotion story:  my 8th grade Spanish teacher, Denise Blum, was conducting her master's degree research  in the early 90's (she did her dissertation on Cuban education).  Her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer at the time, and her prognosis was grim.   Knowing this, Denni told some of her friends in Cuba about the situation, and they told her to go out and find this plant called siempre viva, make a paste out of it, and mix it together with some essential oils.  After rubbing it on the area that her mother was having radiation,  she went into complete remission.  Lung cancer, in remission.   You can read about this amazing plant, also known as the leaf of life,  urlLink here .  How you can go from a 6-months-to-live prognosis to a completely bengin tumor is beyond me--I can't fathom Methodist hospital making that kind of mistake after Brandi's first surgery.  On the other hand, MD Anderson did remove 90% of the tumor, and had that much of it to send to pathology.  Still, very very bizaare this is.  But not so much odd, as it is...GOD!!!  They are still considering giving Brandi radiation just to make sure, and I find that to be a wise move.  I still plan on going down to see her sometime this week, regardless.  Praise the Lord, man.  Apparently everyone's prayers have been working, and a lifetime of thanks could never be enough.  On another exciting note...the Student Latin American Studies Conference this weekend was fantastic.  More on that later.

						    urlLink    Sick  I think that I might have an ulcer.  I've been having severe burning and cramping for about a week now; at first I was really confused, because when that happens it's usually the result of my tummy being in the tropics ;-D I hope that it's not an ulcer, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was--we've all been under quite a bit of stress these past couple of months.  Maybe it's a delayed reaction to my very stressful last semester at UT, and not just all this mess with Brandi.  Speaking of my cousin, she came home yesterday.  She's doing great, but is suffering from some severe headaches.  (For obvious reasons)  The nurses assured her that the headaches were normal due to the fact that the surgeon had cut through so many nerves; that, and the head brace they put on her to keep her head in place while in surgery.  I've got the student ILASSA conference this weekend, where I'm going to present my thesis--but I'm planning on heading down to East Bernard (or as Opa so affectionately calls it, East Barn Yard) some time after that.  I've got a doctor's appointment later on this afternoon.  In the meantime, I'm going to go lay down and try and get some rest.

						   THE AMAZING UPDATE ON BRANDI:  Her neurosurgeon, Dr. Sawaya, was able to remove 90% of her tumor--even though he reported that on a scale of 1-10 in terms of difficulty (1 being the easiest to remove, 10 being the hardest), hers was a 9.  There were no complications, no critical areas were damaged, and she is doing great!  She was awake through most of the surgery so that they could perform electromagnetic mapping (in order to avoid cutting into her speech and motor areas), and was actually able to talk to her mom at one point.  She said to her mom over the phone, "Yeah, I'm doing fine.  Don't have too big of a party out there without me!"  Apparently she just ate a big dinner and is now getting ready to take a nice, long nap.  This just goes to show the power that prayer has.  I had a very good feeling about this surgery, and I really wasn't worried at all; I knew that Brandi was in the best of hands here on earth as well as from the Man upstairs.  For the first time in what seems like forever, they are talking about Brandi's future in terms of years, not months.  Dr. Sawaya gives her at least 4-7 years, and that's with current technology.  He told her to go back to teaching, to get married, and to have children.  That last part brightened the rest of my life, because that's all that Brandi really wants to do.  I want to see that she gets that chance, and now it looks like she just might.   Thank you everyone who has been praying for Brandi and our family--it means more than you'll ever possibly know!

						   Mood: Eh?  Well, I received a letter from the Institute of International Education today informing me that I had passed the New York round for the Fulbright grant to Brazil.  How you can be excited, confused, surprised, and yet not surprised at the same time is beyond me...but that's how I feel.  I'm not surprised because I felt that I had a decent chance of passing this round; the real decision will come from Brazil, however--and they notoriously prefer dissertation candidates for this research grant.  I am surprised due to the timing, mainly because any thoughts about the Fulbright or the possibility of receiving it have been the farthest thing from my mind as of late.  Up until now I really haven't even considered it to be a possibility, and have mainly concentrated on either 2 years in Cuba or starting Grad School in August.  The problem with these things is that if you happen to be named as an alternate, there's a chance that you might not know the final result until late summer or early fall.  That could seriously screw up graduate school plans, although I'm fairly certain that Tulane would let me either defer for a year, or start a semester and then leave mid-year for Brazil.  We'll just have to wait and see; this entire spring is going to be nothing but a waiting game, on more levels than one.  Aunt Rite called me today and asked me not to come up for Brandi's surgery on Wednesday; as much as I would love to be there with her, practically I can understand that me being there would simply add more stress to an already stressful scenario.  Instead, she asked me to wait until Brandi had a more concrete schedule with radiation; that's when she and Brandi are really going to need me.  I'm actually ok with this; I'd rather be there when they truly need my presence.  In addition, I have to prepare for the presentation of my thesis on the 14th and 15th, and get the house ready in time for our out-of-the-country guest; the student Latin American Studies Conference is coming up, and I haven't even had time to give it a second thought.  Another surprise in the mail recently: I've been invited to become a memeber of  urlLink Phi Beta Kappa --apparently the oldest and most prestigious honor's society in existence.  I had no idea what it was (I'm quite clueless when it comes to Greek organizations); Mimi and Opa had to explain it to me.  They seemed very familiar with it, and insisted that I join (as indicated by their willing to spot me the application fee, which is not exactly cheap).  I'm still a bit confused at to what purpose this organization actually serves other than the mere idea of being a member; the other 2 honor societies I'm in stress community service in addition to being a part of their organizations.  Oh well.  Apparently this is something quite worthy, so I feel honored.  They do have a nomination form for an outstanding professor, so I intend to take advantage of that .  On the political front...thank goodness that they are finally ordering an independent council.  We definitely need to get to the bottom of all this.

						    urlLink    Very Happy   I just watched Buena Vista Social Club on Austin City Limits.   Nothing, nothing puts me in a better mood than some good Cuban salsa.  Of course, with that comes some pretty intense nostalgia and second guesses about whether or not I really should take that opportunity to move to Cuba for 2 years in August.  It's just...2 years is such a long time, and with Brandi fighting this battle with cancer I need to be closer to my family.  There really wouldn't be that much of a difference between leaving for Cuba in August and waiting until the summer of 2005.  ::sigh:: I don't know.  The  urlLink Witness for Peace  job application isn't due until March, so I still have a month or so to make up my mind about whether or not I'm going to apply.

						    urlLink    Cheerful  I have actually been on vacation since last Wednesday with one of my best friends, Mildred.  Boston is fantastic!  Technically, we're in Cambridge, since she goes to Harvard :winky:.  It's so quaint!  Very Victorian, almost.  Some of these buildings have been around since the time of our founding fathers.  Two days ago, we went to New York.  It was crazy, insane, and wonderful all at the same time.  I was a very little girl the last time I saw the Big Apple, so I only remember it when it was much dirtier.  On Friday night we saw the Phantom of the Opera (I'd actually never seen it before! :shocked:); for $20 we stood up behind those sitting in the orchestra seats, although they ended up paying $100.  The show was fantastic.  I think that I started drawing too many religious parallels, but nevertheless it was a truly amazing show, with an outstanding cast.  We stayed at the YMCA ($73 per night for 2 people--woo-hoo!)  On Saturday, I think we walked the entirity of Manhattan.  There were moments when I had to lean on Mildred's arm to prevent from collapsing due to exhaustion.  It was wonderful, though; we strolled through Central Park, shopped on 5th Avenue, and then waited for an hour and a half in line to ride to the 86th floor of the Empire State Building.  Can't say that it was truly worth the wait among hundreds of people amidst opressive heat in the basement of the building, but I am glad that I experienced it.  After that crazy excursion, we went to Bloomingdales and had a much-needed glass of wine with some fine dessert in a French restaurant that strangely resembled a street car.  Our last stop in New York was Ground Zero, which was extremely humbling (particularly after walking around in the world's most excessive mall).  It was so sad, although it probably would have been even worse had I actually remembered what the Two Towers looked like.  I still can't fathom all that empty space in the middle of New York City, with blackened and charred buildings around heaps of rubble and steal.  There was a brown cross with an American flag near where the second tower fell, and around the perimeter of the fence surrounding Ground Zero a list of everyone who died on September 11th.  I didn't want to leave, really, but we had to catch the bus back to Chinatown in Boston at 8pm.  Before I said goodbye, though, I did take a picture with a couple of very cute New York fire fighters.  Their dog did this trick where he searched for a doggie treat in an orange street cone, but not before running around aimlessly with it on its head.  So now I'm back in Boston, enjoying a day of rest after the wonderful craziness of New York.  We went shopping today in Filene's Basement (the Texas equivalent of the San Marcos outlet stores), and tomorrow we're planning on getting much-needed back massages after backpacking around New York non-stop for 2 days straight.  We wanted to go salsa dancing tomorrow night as well, but it doesn't appear as if that will pan out.  Regardless, I know we'll figure out something.  Seafood along the bay is most definitely in order.  Hello to the homies back in the Lone Star State--I'll be back Wednesday night.

						    urlLink    Jubilant  Once more God has opened my eyes to several important revelations.  I have been earnestly praying for several days now, nearly always in agony and to the point of banging my head against a wall, "Lord, please take these evil thoughts and temptations away from me.  I hate them; erase them from my head!"  Then the Holy Spirit said to me, very quiet and when I wasn't looking:  "Rejoice in your temptations and struggles!  The devil would like to discourage you and bring you down with guilt, but your Father wishes you to gain strength from your trials and temptations."  And then I realized that I had been praying, in a way, for the wrong thing.  There will always be temptation and evil lurking around us from all sides, at least until Christ returns.  My prayer is not so much that my Lord would take all that away from me (although that would be lovely...), as that I wish for Him to provide me with strength to RESIST temptation.  If God provided Jesus with the strength and courage to resist the temptation and overcome the sin and guilt of every human being that ever was or will be...think of what God can do for me in helping me resist lesser evils!  Also, I was reminded that temptation is not sin.  Yielding to temptation is sin.  Satan was making me feel guilty, wretched, and as if I weren't a strong enough Christian--for the thoughts that he put into my head in the first place!  Tricksy, he is.  I firmly believe that attacking new Christians and making them feel like crap is his personal favorite past time.  Well, this is all I have to say about that: "News flash, ass hole: I am a child of God, and you are the father of lies, deceit, and guilt."

						   Feeling:  The Holy Spirit   A few hours ago I was really having some trouble, in case you couldn't tell from my last post.  I was physically and emotionally worn out, and the devil was throwing darts at me from all sides in my weakened condition, planting random, evil thoughts inside my head.  I got so upset that I ran downstairs, threw myself onto the bed, and started sobbing.  I didn't really have a rhyme or reason to be in such agony, but I was.  I yelled out, "Abba...my Lord Jesus!  Hold me and never let go!"    And then this vision from the Holy Spirit came into my head.  Christ was kneeling down, and he extended His outstretched hand to me.  He said, "Peace!  Peace.  Why did you dout?  Take My hand and get up."  And I got up.  And was immediately drawn to the Scripture of Peter fearing for his life on the water during a storm, which I'd actually never read before.  "Instantly Jesus reached out His hand and caught and held him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"

						    urlLink    Exhausted  I can't even remember the last time I had a decent night's rest...I am so tired, and of course I would have to fast today.  Tomorrow morning I have to have a colonoscopy to figure out what the heck is causing me so much pain.  So, to sum up, I'm haven't eaten, haven't slept, and am quite stressed out.  I am also mentally drained, because I am physically tired from excessive analyzing and reasoning; I think I'm to the point that I just need to turn all this over to the Lord, because no amount of mental debate is going to provide me with a stronger faith than I already have.  This has been exceedingly difficult to accept, as I always want to intellectually rationalize everything.  I need to just let it go and let the Holy Spirit do His work.  I feel like I'm suddenly with Jesus in the desert being tempted with no food or rest; the deceiver keeps throwing darts at me again, and because I'm so weak at the moment, the only thing I can do is shove the Good Book in his face and hold onto Christ for dear life.  I cannot WAIT for the day that we are renewed and no longer have to fight spiritual warfare.  I'm going to go eat God's Word, because at this juncture that's the only source of nourishment I've got.

						   Watching:  CNN  I've spent every night with Mimi since she was admitted to Seton on Saturday (was it Saturday...?).  Despite the lack of sleep, rather uncomfortable chair, yucky hospital food, and attending to her every 20 minutes or so, it's acutally not as bad as I thought it would be.  I've spent pretty much every waking moment reading the Bible and having some long, much-needed chats with the Man upstairs.    It's funny how in our moments of greatest suffering, we are able to be closest to God.  I believe it glorifies Him, in addition to providing us with strength.  I'm sure that as a loving father He wouldn't want it any other way; what parent doesn't want their child to turn to them during their moments of great suffering?    Mimi is still in tremendous pain; though they've given her morphine, it barely masks it.  The doctors have come to the tentative conclusion that she has an infected disk in her spine, which has been causing her pain to the point that she can barely move without yelling out in agony.  Now her right foot is swollen and hurting, and she's having some tremendous pain in her right arm as well.  Not sure what that's all about, but hopefully we'll know more later on today.  .:Sigh:.  I do wish that Mimi would turn herself fully over to the Lord; she'll never truly have peace otherwise.  She's in so much pain that she talks about not wanting to live any more in that condition.  While understandable, it just hurts me more to hear her speak that way.   So, more prayers for my family are once again in order.  Man we've been through alot lately.  But luckily, God is up there hearing our requests.  It would certainly be nice to stop fighting these battles for awhile, though...

						   Here's a fascinating quote from the scriptures, John 2: 18-21  Then the Jews demanded of him, "What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"  Jesus answered them,   "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."    The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"    But the temple he had spoken of was his body.  Ohh...  Think about that.  Puts the Resurrection in perspective, doesn't it?

						    urlLink    Sick  There's a good chance that Opa and I may have picked up the bug that Mimi has had in the hospital since February.  If he's not better by tomorrow, the both of us are going to the doctor to get tested.  The good news: Opa put an offer on the house in East Bernard.  It's this beautiful, one-story house with several hundred more square feet than ours, and mountains of storage space.  In addition to being exactly the kind of house my grandfather has been looking for, it's about a quarter of a mile from Aunt Rite's.  This is so important, as Mimi will need to be closer to family after she leaves the hospital.  This way, she can be within driving (or even walking) distance of her daughter and 2 other granddaughters--Jamie and Brandi.  As I will be leaving Texas for Grad School in August, I will rest significantly easier knowing that my folks will be basically next door to the rest of the family.  This house, assuming that we do buy it, is such a blessing from God.  After the hell that we've through since Christmas, it is amazing to know that the Lord is indeed providing.  Not only has He given Brandi a second chance at life, but He is providing my grandparents with the support and means to be taken care of without so much worry.  And I've been insanely blessed, with Tulane basically wanting to fund my graduate career.  Caroline's right--life in our family is never a happy medium or in-between; it alternates between devastating nightmares and miraculous, divine blessings.  Most people have one our two gut-wrenching experiences in their lives, and are lucky to have a miracle occur.  Our family goes from rock bottom in the pits of despair to ecstatic moments from heaven, with no interim period of just moving on about your business.  I feel as if my life has been one giant, bizaare ping-pong game.  While I don't envision that changing for me anytime soon, I sincerely hope that my grandparents can enjoy some peace and quiet during their remaining years, instead of CRISIS...Miracle.  CRISIS...Miracle.  CRISIS...Miracle.

						    urlLink    Hopeful  I am so exhausted.  I pray that Mimi's C-Dif infection test comes back negative, so that they can move her to an actual re-habilitation hospital.  She seems to have lost all hope of ever walking again, despite countless words of encouragement.  I really do believe that your physical health can depend upon your mental attitude and state; persistant pessimism is certainly not going to get one out of bed and on one's feet.  In any case, Opa is still searching for a house in East Bernard.  I am praying that we can find one, as moving down to be closer with family would be most beneficial for my grandparents at this point.  At this juncture I'm in limbo and am not certain of how to proceed or help out.  As it stands now, I'm planning on returning to Starbucks in order to raise money for the 9-day mission trip to Cuba in July, but I can't very well work full time and be with Mimi in the hospital as much as I have been.  Plus, I myself am leaving the state in August to start Grad School, and I have no clue how my presence will fit in with regard to helping Mimi and Opa move out of the city as well.  Things are so up in the air right now, more than usual, that I rather feel like banging my head against the wall.  Despite the fact that I know my decision to go to Tulane was the right one for me, at some point in the not-too-distant future I know that I'm going to feel awkward as I simply pick up everything and leave--with Mimi still in physical therapy, and with Opa quite possibly having to sell our house and move into another one.    I know that all of my family wants me to be happy and live my own life, but at the same time I can't help but feel a bit strange and self-centered dropping everything and starting a new life.  On the other hand, I know that my grandparents moving to East Bernard to be near the rest of the family would keep Mimi's mind off of the fact that I'm officially moving out and living in another state.  While I've travled all over the world and even lived in an apartment, this next phase of my life will be very different; I won't be coming back to Austin to live, not for a very long time.  The next two years will be in New Orleans, and then after that--who knows?  Ideally I'd like to get my Ph.D. in the Northeast, either in Boston, New York, or D.C.  Oh yeah--I guess I should mention, for those of you whom I haven't mentioned this to--I'll be doing a Master's program in Latin American Studies at Tulane University in New Orleans, staring in late August.  The decision between UT and Tulane was gut-wrenching, but ultimately it came down to the fact that: a) Tulane specializes in Cuba and Caribbean studies; b) I love the city and the campus; and c) Through some divine gift I've been given, Tulane wants to pretty much fund my graduate career.  This way, I can continue research on both Cuba and Brazil in a plausible fashion; if I stayed at UT, I really wouldn't be able to finish a thesis on the Cuban economy and would have to stick with Brazil.  So, this chapter of my life is almost over.  It is about time to open a new one, I suppose.

						    urlLink    Thankful  Today is my birthday--and as much as I've tried to brush it off as coincidence, I find no coincidence in the fact that this year in particular, my birthday has fallen immediately after Good Friday and immediately before Easter.  This, after all, was the year that I completely and fully turned my life over to the Lord.  I died, but was born again in Christ.  "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!" 2 Corinthians 5  Is it any surprise, then, that my birthday this year was the day after Christ died and the day before His resurrection?  Exactly when death was defeated through Him that died on the Cross?  God has some strange yet beautiful and perfect planning, I must say.  By the way--Happy Easter, everyone ;-)

						    urlLink    He is speaking  I left Mimi's rehabilitation hospital today in a bad mood; I was in pain, didn't want to be there, and was still frustrated that the laparoscopic surgery on Monday found nothing outwardly wrong with me.  As I was driving back towards the house, I looked up at the sky.  It looked alot like the photo above.  My eyes lit up and I just started grinning from ear to ear; whenever I see a sunbeam like that in the sky, I think of it as God's little way of saying hello.  I felt silly for being in such a bad mood, and it was as if God was opening up the sky and saying, "Why are you so upset?"  The photo, by the way, is from  urlLink here .

						    urlLink    Disappointed  Well, my worst fear came true regarding surgery this morning.  It's good news and bad news, depending upon how you want to look at it.  My surgeon found absolutely nothing wrong with me.  No endometriosis, no sigmoid or pelvic adhesions, no scar tissue...nothing.  Nada.  Everything looks completely normal, including my female organs.  This is exactly what I did  not  want to hear, because now the doctors are even more clueless as to what's causing me so much pain.  I feel like screaming.  This pain is not all in my head!  How could "absolutely nothing" be causing all this pain?!  I'll need to seek out another gastrointerologist, another OB-GYN, and quite probably a pain specialist.  My only source of comfort at the moment is Matthew Chapter 8, Verse 17: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases..."  At this point I'm like, "Christ!  Only You can heal me."

						    urlLink    Humbled  This morning, I was simultaneously chiding myself for not getting up early enough for church and defending myself by saying that I no longer felt that I was learning enough there.  I love Westlake UMC, as I have been going there pretty much since my birth, but I feel that I need something more--namely, a more Scripture-focused worship service.  I glanced at the book on my coffee table, Grace for the Moment by Max Lucado.  I randomly flipped through and stopped at 2 particular pages, with 2 similar, yet different messages.  Coincidentally enough, they were exactly what God wanted me to hear--as their subject matter has been a stumbling block for me lately.  1.  Faith Meets Grace   Let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith, because we have been made free from a guilty conscience...-Hebrews 10: 22   Faith is not born at the negotiating table where we barter our gifts in exchange for God's goodness.  Faith is not an award given to the most learned.  It's not a prize given to the most disciplined.  It's not a title bequeathed to the most religious.  Faith is a desperate dive off the sinking boat of human effort and a prayer that God will be there to pull us out of the water.  The apostle Paul wrote about this kind of faith:   "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast." (Eph. 2:8-9)   The supreme force in salvation is God's grace.  2.  Itemized Grace   The Lord knows those who belong to Him.--2 Timothy 2:19   Imagine the event.  You are before the judgement seat of Christ.  The book is opened and the reading begins--each sin, each deceit, each occasion of destruction and greed.  But as soon as the infraction is read, grace is proclaimed...  The result?  God's merciful verdict will echo through the universe.  For the first time in history, we will understand the depth of his goodness.  Itemized grace.  Catalogued kindness.  Registered forgiveness.  We will stand in awe as one sin after another is proclaimed, and then pardoned...  The devil will shrink back in defeat.  The angels will step forward in awe.  And we saints well stand tall in God's grace.  As we see how much he has forgiven us, we will see how much he loves us.  And we will worship him.  The result will be the first genuine community of forgiven people.  Only one is worthy of the applause of heaven, and he's the one with the pierced hands and feet.  ~~~~~  After reading that, I cried for about 10 minutes.

						    urlLink    Pensive  Last night I had a prophetic vision.  At least, I strongly feel that it's a prophetic vision; if it fails to come true...well then, I was just daydreaming.  Something hit me after I read  this  article.  I have been studying Biblical prophecy at length recently, and I am struck by the fact that I cannot locate anything concrete or specific with regard to the United States, or even the Western Hemisphere, in prophecy.  Then it occured to me: what if there's a reason for that?  This country was, after all, founded upon Christian principles--and despite a rather loud minority, the majority of the people in this nation are, in fact, Christian.  Not only is the US the most powerful nation in the world, but it is one of the few nations left that remains a staunch supporter of Isreal.  As we are fighting this war on terror, it is becoming abundantly clear that there are two groups of people that these fundamentalists want dead--Christians, and Jews.  They want to destroy the United States, and they want to destroy Isreal.  No matter how hard they try, they will never fully destroy the Jewish people, because Isreal is God's prime piece of real estate, and they were, and are, His chosen people.  We Gentiles have just been blessed enough to be invited in on the Word and the chance for salvation.  But could they destroy us?  Not easily, I don't believe--and certainly not unless it was on God's timetable.  What I mean by that is this--there is a certain event referred to as The Rapture of the Church.  This is differentiated from the Second Coming of Christ, as it refers to the moment in which Christ appears in the clouds, and all His believers are "caught up with Him".  The idea behind this is that God has not appointed His believers to the wrath of the coming 7 years of Tribulation, when the antichrist will appear and claim to be God.  The basis for this is  1 Thessalonians 4 ,  1 Corinthians 15 , and  Luke 17: 34-36 .  This does not imply that the Christian Church will not undergo some form of tribulation; it simply means that God would not wish to have His children be on earth as it comes to a rather horrifying end.  And even then, God will provide two witnesses to preach the Truth and the Gospel, in order to bring those left behind into the Light.  There will be Tribulation Saints, people who refuse to deny Christ and as a result suffer greatly under the antichrist dictator.  But their souls will be lifted up to the Lord in Heaven as well, and their reward great for enduring such suffering.   "Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill   you, and you will be hated by all nations on account of My name." (Matthew 24:9)  &#42;There is much debate about the Rapture: is it before, during, or after the Tribulation?  To me, it really doesn't make that much of a difference.  The point is, there are several things that must happen in order to usher in the End Times and the Great Tribulation.    Think about this: what if the Rapture were to occur tomorrow, or in the next moment?  What if, rather suddenly, hundreds of millions, possibly billions of people were to dissapear?  As the majority of people in this country are Christian, the United States will have just dissapeared.  Several people have spoken of and written about this event-namely, the Left Behind series.  But what if a more likely scenario occured instead of millions of people just vanishing into thin air?  The evil terrorists are already planning another attack on the U.S., and according to top sources, they wish it to be even more horrendous than 9-11.  There is talk of them using weapons of mass destruction.  We have been informed not, under any circumstances, to underestimate these threats.  What if the unthinkable were to happen?  What if the terrorists were to be successful in that endeavor, but through a combination of their abilities and God's plan, only Christians in this country died?  What if, through that seemingly horrible event, God was actually rescuing His Church from the wrath to come?  There could not be a more appropriate time for the ultimate deceiver to arise.  What would happen?  The world would fall into chaos.  The world economy would collapse.  Masses would demand retribution for the hateful act, and would, presumably, need a very powerful, charismatic leader to control society.  In order to finally end the war on terror, this seemingly peaceful man (who is in fact, the antichrist) would say something like this:  "This is an act of injustice, against one of the greatest nations on this earth.  These evil men who commit these deeds must not go unpunished--look what they have done.  They have killed innocent, God-fearing people.  What's next?  We must finally put an end to the violence in the middle east.  With the help of so-and-so and such-and-such organization, we can do just that.  We can at last finish this "Road Map to Peace", and work with the Palestinians in signing a final peace accord with Isreal.  Then, and only then, will we finally achieve peace on this earth."  WRONG.  There will never be peace, until Christ returns.  But this seemingly helpful leader will deceive all the nations, and confirm that "peace" covanent with Isreal.  He will stamp down on terror.  Think about it--what if the United States of America, Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, was gone?  There would be no freedom left.  A powerful, one-world government would arise in order to combat the remaining terrorist organizations.  The dollar will have collapsed, and everybody will probably adopt the Euro.  (By the way...did you know that even as of today the Euro is stronger than the dollar?  Did you know that more and more nations are joining the European Union?)  People will be forced to have their social security numbers implanted under their skin, in order to tract down terrorist activities and prevent the smuggling of arms and money.  You wouldn't be able to buy or sell anything without it.  The problem is, if you were to accept the mark...well, it's the mark of the Beast, so DON'T ACCEPT IT.  There would be no freedom, but hey--everybody would be "safe!"  People at that point would sacrifice personal freedom for saftey, because who wants to be destroyed by weapons of mass destruction?   "The day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night [at an unsuspected time]. For when they shall say, "Peace and safety!" then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman" -1 Thessalonians 5: 2-3  Well, 3 1/2 years after the antichrist confirms the covanent with Isreal, he will ruthlessly break it--he will stand upon the Holiest of Holies in the Jerusalem Temple, and declare himself to be God.  And unlike anything God would do, he will demand that everyone bow to him and the Beast (Satan.)  If you do not, you'll die.  Physically, yes--but not spiritually, because everyone who remains faithful in Christ will never face eternal death.   "But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judea flee to the mountains." --Jesus, (Mark 13:14 KJV)    "He opposes and exalts himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, and even sets himself up in God's Temple, proclaiming himself to be God." (2 Thessalonians 2:4)   "Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many.  At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.  For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect--if that were possible.  So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time." --Jesus, (Mark 13: 6, 21-23)  After the antichrist breaks the covanent, all hell will break loose. (literally)  A third of the earth's population will die, and just when things get to the point that everyone wonders if they can take much more, Jesus Christ will return to earth on the Mount of Olives, smile, and say "I'm back..."  That's when the world will finally have true peace, with the Prince of Peace.  Jerusalem will become the Garden of Eden again, the lion will lay down with the lamb, there will be no sadness, and no war.  And the best part is, Christ will be our King! :-D  Anyway, long story made very long...my point is this: I truly believe that when the end of the world does come, the United States will probably no longer be on the earthly scene.  Every empire before us eventually collapsed, and I have no reason to doubt ours would as well.  The Bible makes it very clear that the Christian Church will not be around during earth's darkest hour...so it would make sense that the U.S. would not be present.  I'm sure there are people out there who would dissagree with me, and that's OK.  But last night this vision hit me, almost floored me.  Perhaps it will happen, perhaps not.  But let us wait and be vigilent, and watch as Christ has commanded us nevertheless.  If you will thoroughly study Biblical Prophecy and compare it with current events, you'll be surprised at how fast this earthly train is heading towards its end.  &#42;  This  webpage actually gives a very good Biblical account about the Rapture of the Church.  Again, I want to emphasize that it's not so much  when  the Rapture occurs, but exaclty what we need to be looking out for in terms of Christ's Second Coming: The Abomination of Desolation when the antichrist declares himself God.

						    urlLink    Melancholy  As I sit here drinking my peppermint tea and listening to the rain pounding down on our tin roof, I can't help but feel a pang of bittersweetness as I come to the realization that we are, in fact, selling this house.  This house I was brought home from the hospital to, in mid-May of 1981 during the infamous memorial day floods.  I've rarely admitted it, but it is indeed a most beautiful home, and I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that it's located on one of the finest lots in Austin.  A 1/2 acre, taking up virtually an entire coul-de-sac, in the heart of Westalke Hills and 10 minutes to just about anything.  And this house, the house that my grandfather designed...well, naturally it would always seem perfect in my eyes, as I've grown up here.  White stucco, with fine gates and a courtyard, and a sign on the front that reads "La ultima casa"--which means "the last house" in Spanish.  I'm not sure whether that's just irony, or if that sign was a hint of things to come: not only am I the only one in my family who speaks Spanish (which would make it all the more bizaare that my grandparents would put up a sign in Spanish well before I was born), but this is apparently not the last house.    I've always intuitively known that it would never be  my  last house, but I had always assumed that Mimi and Opa would never move.  Our family flirted with moving when I was in high school, but their answer was always "we're too old to move."  Now it seems we are moving out of this house out of necessity--necessity for a one-story house in which my handicapped grandmother can move around in, and the necessity for funds in order to provide for my grandparents during the remaining years of their life.  And of course, there's the little fact that I'm actually leaving--for Tulane in August.  This is it--this is the end game.  I will be leaving Austin and won't be returning to live for a very long time, if at all; I would like to receive my Ph.D. in International Relations from a school up in the Northeast after completing my Master's program.  So, with virtually nothing to hold them back, including their granddaughter, my folks are saying goodbye to the house they never imagined they'd be leaving, and moving to a very very tiny town about 50 miles west of Houston.  Why are they moving to a city with maybe a little over 1,000 people?  Because there are 3 people down there that count--their daughter (my Aunt Rite), and their other 2 granddaughters, Jamie and Brandi.  For 23 years my grandparents have taken care of me and pretty much have had me to themselves.  Now, thankfully, they will be spending some quality time with the rest of our small immediate family.  I know that this move will be the best thing for them, as I was not planning to ever again live in this house anyway after finishing my education.  I keep telling myself, "It's just a house, Rose.  It's just a stucco building."  But no matter how much I try, I can't convince myself of that.  It's more than just a house.  I've spent my entire life in this one place, with both good and bad memories.  And then, like 'the twinkling of an eye', everything is drastically thrown out of its usual abode.  I'm not implying that's a bad thing--I'm just saying that it's bittersweet and overwhelming.  ~~~~~~  On a completely different note, I am scheduled for my laparoscopic surgery on the 24th of May.  Nothing major, but hopefully we'll figure out what's causing me all this horrendous pain.  I'm actually quite terrified that the surgeon will come back and say, "Sorry!  Didn't find a thing wrong with you.  It's probably just your overly-sensitive stomach."  Sorry, I don't buy that answer--this pain is not all in my head.  A "sensitive stomach" wouldn't keep me bed-ridden for nearly 2 weeks straight, with the feeling that someone is stabbing me in the ovaries.

						     urlLink    Much pain Oh my goodness, I'm in so much pain.  I have no idea what's wrong with me, and neither do the doctors.  In addition to the constant dull ache and pain in my abdominal region, every few minutes I'll also feel an incredibly sharp shooting pain--like someone is sticking a knife into my gut.  For the past few days especially, it's been concentrated in the lower right quadrant of my abdomen.  When I saw my gastrointerologist yesterday, he seemed concerned that the pain was not originating from my intestinal region--as I have assumed for the past year.  I had a abdominal and pelvis CT scan today to rule out anything potentially life-threatening, but he says that regardless he wants to do what's called a laparoscopy: a small incision is made in the abdomen, where a scope is incerted and the surgeon can take a look at my female plumbing, so to speak.  He mentioned that due to my history,  endometriosis  is a strong possibility.  While I no nothing for sure yet until that is undoubtedly proven as the cause of my pain, it is still rather unnerving; endometriosis is one of the leading causes of infertility in women.  My grandmother had very painful menses, as well as ovarian cysts.  She eventually had to have a hysterectomy as a result of all the problems.  While I hope I won't have to do the same, I am prepared to deal with the consequences.  Considering all the mental illness in my family, it actually might be wiser to adopt rather than have my own children--though I would certainly prefer the latter.  Uugh.  I hope I get some answers soon.

Moving has been...well, interesting to say the least.  We're all trying to make the most out of it.  Here's a couple of classic exchanges between my grandfather and I through the course of the last few weeks, complete with our charming sarcasm which we use to bounce off of eachother.  Honestly, we're so much alike, we probably shouldn't be under one roof.  (After getting his hands very dirty) Me: Hey!  That's soap for my face!  Or was... Opa: You don't have a bar of soap for your knees?  How about one for your elbows, too?  (After asking me to hand him books to put on a shelf in the living room) Me: Could I sit down and eat first?  I just got up... Opa: Eating is superflous. Me: Superflous?  Oh really?  Last time I thought that, I was anorexic.  Maybe I should just go back to that.  Opa: Would you move?!  I want to install my printer!!! Me: Could it wait 30 seconds? I'd like to check the radar to see if we're going to get hit by a tornado. Opa: I don't care! Me: Wow, I sure do.  And by the way, that's my printer, that I found after unloading 7 boxes looking for your power cord.  We're only half serious ;-) While it might sound like we're going to kill eachother, it's usually just because we are two perfectionists trying to operate within the same space.

						    urlLink    Drained  You know, it would be really nice to sleep through one night-- just one night --without being interrupted.  I know it's not Mimi's fault; she's completely helpless.    I've taken up running, which I haven't done since I was a sophomore in college.  But I absolutely must have some way to release this stress.  I'd like to just run and run and keep running on out of here, but I usually just run to my cousin Jamie's house and play with her dog and cats before I have to run back to my house and try to put on a happy face.  Oh well.  I might as well go back to my old schedule of staying up all night and sleeping during the day, because it would appear that I don't have an option.  I'm praying for some strenghth from the Lord, because how am I supposed to handle grad school if I'm too damned tired from all the life-altering traumas that have occured since I graduated in December?  So much for a semester off of rest--I've spent it in the hospital with my cousin who has a brain tumor, in the hospital with my grandmother who can't walk or do anything by herself, and moving from the place where I was born to a town of maybe 1,000 people.  Could I PLEASE HAVE A BREAK?!  Sorry for the bitchy, whiny rant.  I'm blessed and I know it, I just need a place to vent.

						     Feeling: Moody  I'm not sure what my problem is, but I have been in such a bitchy mood lately.  Which is a bit unusual for me, because if I'm ever frustrated or upset, I never show it--the stress ends up expressing itself with me becoming ill.  Either my hormones must be re-adjusting themselves, or the move to East Bernard is finally taking its toll.  And it's hard taking care of my grandmother--one of the 15 pills she takes every day makes her need to get up like every 2 hours, so my sleep is spotty at best.  Perhaps it's the lack of a decent night's rest without interruption that's making me cranky.  And on top of all this, we lost game 1 of the college world series tonight, all because of one too many stupid errors.  On a happier note (I suppose...), I finally got a haircut today.  It used to be down to my butt, but it just got far too long and heavy.  Several months ago I cut it to my upper back, but today I got it chopped off to my shoulders and layered a bit for body.  It's just  so bloody humid  down here, and I'm also leaving for the tropics in July and New Orleans in August.  So I can't handle long hair in that kind of weather.

						   Feeling: Tired   Oh man.  I slept in today for the first time in what seems like ages.  We moved my grandmother from the Summit in Austin to here in East Bernard on Tuesday, after spending 4 days straight unloading moving boxes.  So in addition to getting our new house together, Opa and I need to take care of Mimi--who can't walk.  Fortunately, Opa purchased a lifting machine to help, and we have an at-home registered nurse to come in every day for a few hours.    Also, we are blessed to have the rest of our immediate family like 2 minutes away from us~ my Aunt Rite, and two cousins Jamie and Brandi.  My cousins are like the sisters I never had, but despite the fact that we basically grew up together, we haven't seen much of eachother since we've become adults.  It is so nice and refreshing to have them drop by after work and check in on us, to have them in our lives again.  It's going to be so much easier on Mimi when I move to New Orleans for Grad School in August, because she'll have her other 2 granddaughters here to spend time with her.  But...we are all exhausted.  Almost past going, from the effort of moving in and taking care of someone full time who can't take care of herself.  I almost have to take a hot bath nightly in order to wind down.  Everyone who's reading this...my cousin Brandi needs your prayers once again.  The crappy insurance company she had while she was working in Bryan/CS has denied all coverage for her brain tumor treatment at MD Anderson, which amounts to quite a hefty penny.  I hoping that we'll be able to help out after we've closed on the house in Austin, but nevertheless this is the last thing Brandi needs right now.  Her mother (my Aunt) is having problems with her job, has worked her butt off helping us move in and get Mimi situated, and has had to worry non-stop about her daughter Brandi for close to 6 months now.  I think we all have a little too much on our plate right now, and we constantly need to be reminded that the Lord will provide.  I pray that things calm down soon; if not, another one of our family members is going to have a heart attack.

						    urlLink    Feeling: Ok  I never knew Ronald Reagan; I was an infant during his presidency.  Can't say that I agree with his politics, but I think that he was an honorable man.  I am particularly frustrated with what he did in Latin America during the Cold War; even though he apologized regarding the Contra mess, it still doesn't change the fact that he did more to disrupt the democratic process in Latin America than promote it.  Everybody is pretty familiar with the Iran-contra scandal, but not many people know about Reagan's other dealings with Latin America; he was a huge supporter of the dictator Pinochet in Chile, the dictatorial military of Argentina, as well as the one in Guatemala.  What we did we claimed we were doing as a lesser of two evils, but Latin American nations are still feeling the sting of our policy many years later--though democracy is slowly gaining a foothold.  We basically shook the hands of very right-wing Latin American dictators, trained their militaries, and provided them arms to hunt down revolutionaries.  The problem?  Those trained military officials that we were helping decided to just kill everybody in the process--not just those espousing communist or socialist ideals.  In order to "stamp out" communism, these military dictators that we trained and quite often put in charge would not just kill the revolutionaries, but the friend of the friend of the cousin of the friend of the revolutionaries.  As a result,  hundreds of thousands  of people went "missing" or were out-right executed.  Did you know that the military dictatorship Reagan helped put in place in Guatemala to deal with the revolutionaries ended up killing 800,000 people?  There are mothers still looking for their children, both in Argentina and Chile.  So...moral of the story is--yes, we did win the Cold War, but at a very hefty price.  I believe that the main difference between how we're handling Iraq and how we handled Latin America is that we are working very closely with the Iraqi people in helping them to eradicate terror.  We are  not  installing dictators to kill the terrorists, which is exactly what we did in Latin America during the Cold War.  We wonder now why democracy isn't spreading as quickly as we had hoped in Central America.  Why?  Because often times we would over-throw the democratically elected leaders there, who just happened to have some socialist ideals.  It got to the point where Latin Americans just wrung their hands and said, "What the hell do you want from us, exactly?  You want us to be democratic and anti-communist, but in order to do that you are subverting the democratic process by training anti-communist dictators.  What gives?"  So, to sum up.  I am very sorry for the Reagan family loss, but I am also thankful that former President Reagan isn't suffering anymore, as he had a most terrible disease that I wouldn't wish on my worst Latin American enemy.  I think that his heart was in the right place during the Cold War, and he wanted what was best for the United States.  But, as is almost always the case, what is best for the United States comes at the cost of many other innocent (and not so innocent) lives.

						    urlLink     Feeling: OK    Today started out crummy, but ended on a much better note.  We've all been pretty worried about Brandi; yesterday morning, she got up because she felt pretty bad.  She must have fainted, because she woke up after hitting the floor.  The local doctor seems to think that it was probably a slight seizure, and increased her medication a bit.        This morning, she had a meeting with Dr. Fitzgerald--the neurosurgeon who performed Brandi's first brain surgery (and gave us the original horrific news about her brain tumor being the most malignant).  Dr. Fitzgerald thinks that Brandi should have radiation as soon as possible to remove the remaining 10% of the tumor, but Dr. Sawaya and Yung at M.D. Anderson wanted to hold off on that; you can have only so much radiation during one's life, and they don't want her to regress in her speech therapy right before starting her teaching job.  What's frustrating is that M.D. Anderson, the top cancer center in the world, is arguing with the pathologists at Methodist hospital regarding exactly what to do about Brandi's tumor.  It's an extremely rare one, and I don't think anyone knows exactly sure what to expect.  But the doctors at M.D. Anderson are the ones that removed a majority of the tumor--and they also gave Brandi a completely different diagnosis than Methodist (benign vs. the most malignant).  Overall, I'm going with their expertise, though Dr. Fitzgerald has been wonderful in helping us out.  As Aunt Rite put it, she's thinking of the glass as half empty, while M.D. Anderson thinks of it as half full.          So today was the first day in 2 months that Brandi had any negative news whatsoever about her brain, and I know that bothered her quite a bit.  She wants to feel that she's normal again, and can take on the world.  I don't care what the doctors say--I know that Brandi will overcome these temporary pains, headaches, and set-backs, and she will be the best kindergarten teacher in Texas.        Today is my Aunt Rite's birthday, and all her old co-workers at Brookwood threw her a big party at Los Amigos.  She had no idea that everyone was going to be there, which is funny b/c news gets around this town in a heartbeat.  It was definitely the pick-me-up that she and Brandi needed.        I've been so wrapped up with family and moving that I'm just now realizing that I'm leaving soon.  Exciting, but scary at the same time.        I need to write this stuff down, or I'll forget it:       Call Richmond Bone and Spine Center regarding Mimi's water therapy  Call Tulane's Financial Aid Office  Go to Walmart to pick up supplies for Cuba  Change driver's license address online    Pay bills  Start making packing list

						    urlLink     Mood: Worried  Mimi is in the hosptial. Again. This time, it's supposedly a urinary tract infection, which for most people would require a regular antibiotic and a few days to recover from. Mimi, however, is 73 and in fragile health--and, she appears to be immune to the antibiotics they are giving her.   My main concern is that she already feels depressed and discouraged from not being able to walk and take care of herself; in order to become truly motivated to do extensive physical therapy in order to walk again, she needs to see some sort of tangible improvement. However, it took over 3 months for her to end up in this weak position; therefore, it will more than likely take double that to recover--and that's  if  she's in relatively good health, without any infections.   More bad news: Brandi owes about twice as much as she thought she did to MD Anderson. These people need to understand that she is trying her best (and emptying her and her mother's bank account) in order to receive speech therapy that she desperately needs in order to continue in her recovery. Particularly since she starts teaching kindergarten in August. I for one believe that she'll be a fantastic teacher, because I know that she already is (despite current difficulties). Even after we gave her and Aunt Rite a decent penny after closing on the house in Austin, it's still a drop in the bucket compared to what she still needs. East Bernard might need to pull together again and have another fund raiser.   On a more positive note...I leave for Cuba next Wednesday. I haven't even had time to contemplate that.   I have had the chance this evening to look at the Fall 2004 schedule for the Latin American Studies MA at Tulane, and boy am I excited. Of course all the awesome classes are graduate level ;-P I've narrowed the list of choices down to about 9, though I think I only have to take 9 hrs to be a full time Grad student:    Core Seminar for LAS Grad students  International Political and Economic Relations  Information and Communication Technology for Developing Countries   Politics and Nationalism  Cuba under Castro    Modern Brazil   Sustainable Human Development I   Intro to Latin American Economic Analysis I   Haitian Creole I   Five Decades of Latin American Development   I'm not exactly sure when I need to register, but the formal period at Tulane is only a few days. I saw that with a bit of skepticism--and then I realized that Tulane is an  extremely  small school compared to my alma mater. Therefore, considering that there are only about 20 Latin American Studies Grad Students...I don't think we'll be running over eachother, clogging up the phone lines, or rushing to our comps to get the top classes. Nevertheless, I have my list ;-)

						    urlLink     Feeling: Sick  Bleh. I feel terrible, but I know why: it was the food I ate last night at the local restaurant in town (one of the only ones). It's a locally-owned Mexican place, and while the food is OK, my Aunt had failed to mention that they don't clean particularly well. Lovely. My cousin Brandi got sick too, so I know it's not just my sensitive stomach again. The problem is that they've all been going there every Thursday night since Uncle Ronnie died, so it's become tradition now. I'm leaving for Cuba in just a few weeks, and the last thing I need right now is to get sick.  Yesterday Brandi and I took the 45-minute drive to Sugarland to see The Terminal and eat at Souper Salad. We both liked the movie alot, although the ending was a bit different than what we had expected. It was so nice to just spend some quality time with her, a fellow 23-year-old. Although she is having trouble with her former insurance company in covering her MD Anderson medical expenses, she does recognize that she's lucky to be alive. If God had not performed a miracle and the first diagnosis of her brain tumor had actually been correct, her 6 months would be up and she'd be dead by now.  I'm so excited about the Cuba mission trip on July 23rd; I can't wait to go back to my beloved Cuba, but this time under a religious rather than academic context. I am, however, going to take extensive notes; I might need them later for my thesis research.  Tomorrow I get to see Caroline in Houston! I have a meeting about the Cuban mission trip on Sunday at 3pm, so she invited me to stay the night in Houston so that I wouldn't get lost trying to find the Methodist Church (I've never driven to Houston by myself, and I have an absolutely horrible sense of direction). Caroline is leaving soon for a job in Arizona, so I honestly don't know when I'll get to see her next :( This is a very good opportunity for her, though.

This is a rather new concept for me, as up until now I have lived in Austin where there is far too much light pollution.  It was a  perfect  night for fireworks, and for star-gazing ;-) Happy Birthday, US of A.

						     Feeling: Good Song of the moment:  Feelin' Good , Nina Simone  I like it here in East Bernard.  It's slow and quiet, and gives me time to think.  I never really did much in Austin anyway, so leaving the terrible traffic and just looking at sunsets over corn fields is actually kind of nice.  And everybody knows everybody else, and the whole town always lends out a helping hand when you need it.  So what if there's small-town gossip?  At least people give a damn if something happens to you.  This evening I went around the neighborhood with Brandi, and she introduced me to several 40-something women who all happen to work in the local school district somehow, having a party.  It was hilarious; they were all dancing in the kitchen to old 70's tunes, with this red-neck, foul-mouthed comedian in the background.  In the next house we went to, there were people of all ages, and when Brandi introduced me they all yelled in unison "Hi Rose!!!"  Welcome to small-town Texas.  Back in Rollingwood in Austin, it was illegal to have fireworks within the city limits.  Here, it's like, "Who cares?  We're brakin' out the beer and settin' 'em off early!"  I have no idea what we're doing tomorrow, but I'm sure it'll involve hot dogs, hamburgers, and the cheese from Vincek's smokehouse up the street.

						    urlLink    Mood: Angry  Please view  urlLink this  article to understand my cousin Brandi's current plight (on top of everything else). She is undergoing chemotherapy at present, and we're not sure if she can continue her much-needed therapy at MD Anderson unless Bryan ISD steps up to the plate and covers her medical bills as they said they would. Note also that it wasn't until March that the district informed us that there was ever a problem, long after Brandi had sought treatment at MD Anderson (which they knew about). They assured us that everything was fine, that she would have no problem, and that the insurence would cover her expenses. Apparently, they lied.  If you are reading this and know my family (or even if you don't), please e-mail and/or call Bryan ISD's interim superintendent. Since this is a local policy, they can change it if enough pressure is placed on them to do so. It needs to be changed--not merely for Brandi's sake, but for for the sake of any teacher employed by Bryan ISD.  You may reach the interim superintendent (Mike Cargill) at: mcargill@bryanisd.org (979) 209-1002  By the way--this guy was a coach and apparently knows nothing about district (or state) policy.

						    urlLink     Currently: Working  I've decided to change the main focus of my thesis.  While I'm slightly bummed about the fact that I won't be using a majority of the research information that I've accumulated during the past 2 years, it's not all in vain.  After my second trip to Cuba, I experienced a wake-up call of sorts.  The origional plan for my Master's Thesis was to concentrate on the Cuban economy; once the economic embargo is lifted, how can Cuba simultaneously streamline its economy while maintaining its vast social-welfare programs?  The last time I was in Cuba, I was living with other Americans; this time was different.  I was able to see exaclty how Cubans lived, and how the government's 'socialized medicine and health care' actually functioned.  I jumped off of the socialist band wagon really fast and realized that no government is efficient enough to be in charge of everyone's health care and education--it always ends badly.  Everyone is very well educated in Cuba--nearly everyone goes to college.  And, the government does indeed pay for it.  But after becoming a doctor, lawyer, professor, or any other professional with a higher degree, how can the gov't expect you to 'give back' to society if you're only paid $10 per month?  How is it logical to expect your people to return the favor to society if they have to feed their families through rations?  All 11 million people in Cuba have a roof over their heads--no one is homeless.  But what good is that statistic if the roof is falling down or caving in due to a crappy infrastructure?  And as far as the 'fabulous' health care system in Cuba is concerned...it's not all that fabulous.  Any Cuban has free access to a doctor for as long as they live.  That doctor may write you a prescription for any medication you need.  But what good is that if you can't get the medicine because no one has it?  Cuba doesn't have the proper technology or resources to treat you to the best of its ability, even though you don't have to pay anything.  Long story short, you get what you pay for there.  So, why in my right mind (and heart) would I want to come up with some brilliant economic theory to preserve this system if the system doesn't even work?  Despite the fact that I've been told that I do have some good ideas with regard to finding the 'balance' between the U.S.'s capitalism and Cuban socialism, any theory I would have would not be plausible when trying to put it into practice.  I've decided to start working on something more enjoyable, meaningful, worthwhile, and closer to my heart: religion.  Now that I've been involved in both the African Santería and Christian communities in Cuba, I can now begin to analyze how both groups function within Cuba's socio-political framework.  I'd like to understand why, for example, the regime fully supports Santería, but vehmently works to undermine anyone professing the Christian faith.  Why are they supporting one religion over another?  Why do they seem frightened about Christian influence?  Why is the average Cuban afraid to speak their mind in their repressed society, but a Cuban Christian fears no one--even their dictator?  I want  this  to be my thesis, and dissertation.  I have the opportunity now to blend what I'm learning in both the academic and spiritual realm (praise God), and I couldn't be more excited.

						    urlLink    Content  My second trip to Cuba altered the direction of my life; it was truly amazing.  Christian Cubans have some of the strongest faith I've ever seen, despite the oppression and restrictions they suffer.  I can definitively say that I learned more this past week in Cuba than the entire 5 months that I was there two years ago.  Although I was on a missionary trip, I really feel that  I  was the one whose faith was touched and further solidified by the very people we were sharing the gospel with.  They have so very little material wise, and yet they have everything that counts--a love for Christ that is rock-solid no matter what difficulties are thrown their way.  As I was driving back to my house today, I felt suddenly heartbroken.  I realized that I actually had the option of leaving Cuba and seeing the rest of my family; the Cubans that I've become so close to and who are so dear to my heart don't have that luxery.  At the Havana airport on the way back to Miami, I watched in horror and extreme sadness as hundreds of Cubans sobbed while waving goodbye to their family members who actually received the opportunity to board a plane to the States.  Cuban Americans are only allowed to apply for visas to visit family members in Cuba once every 3 years now, and some visas might not even be granted.  I could write a book about my trip, and I'll be talking more on here about it later.  I can't and won't discuss everything, but I can share just what an impact this second trip had, and probably will have, on my life.
