      Blogging has been light, due to the 'business' of the school holidays (which have been going for all of 1 day). At least with the horrific soul-deadening experience of school, you're doing something. Now all I do is think too much about stuff and people, and then mope about.  Anyway, expect some new material on Swashagunga's Realm soon, I feel a big ball of contempt climbing up my throat. If you didn't know, the link is over there under the heading that says "LINKS".  Ciao bambinos.

      The stupid little freaks next hit another damned ball over into our backyard today, so to teach them a lesson I have decided to ignore the doorbell's incessant ringing.  Little bastards

      It seems I was misinformed about the bathroom. It isn't finished. The waste water hasn't been done, so at the moment all the water from the shower just goes under the house. I don't have a problem with this, but it is apparently bad.  So I decided that I'd better have a shower, so I went out to the parent's abode, and whaddya know, I can't find my god forsaken towel.  I hate everyone so much

      So life continues here at the ***REMOVED FOR SECURITY PURPOSES*** household.  The bathroom is now finished FINALLY but it smells kind of funny in there...  My step-sister is coming down for the weekend, what a fantabulous way to start the school holidays.  So I'm going to go watch horror movies and Futurama.  It's all falling into place...

      The bathroom reneveations are nearly complete! They would have been finished today, but the screen isn't ready yet. I don't know what the screen is, but I can't wait until its ready, because we will have our bathroom back!!!

      I just finished the arduous task of making one loaf worth of fairy bread (don't ask...) and now get to the fun bit of finding all the 100's and 1000's that scattered themselves withing a seeming disregard for the laws of physics and conservation of mass and picking some out of the freshly microwaved butter (yes, it's that cold yet the butter continually finds its way to the fridge...).  Then I thought "How the hell do I get this to school?"  Greeaat...

      10:43 this morning, I look at my watch, and think "Oh poo. I left my Lit stuff at home". So I kind of left without so much as a word, got home and got my stuff. Told Dad I would like to go in about 15 minutes and he replied with the usual "no problem" kind of response. So I relax a bit, and suddenly realise I have to get going.  But where is Dad? I look out the window, and wouldnt you know it, the falcon is gone. At this time I am a bit peeved. My brother couldn't take me- the builder's trailer blocked his car.  So I begin to walk, fuming, and as soon as I turn the corner here comes the falcon.  So I get a lift only to be about 5 minutes late (better than when I forgot to go to class entirely) and settled in to watch a painfully boring  Pride and Prejudice . Anyway, get out of class, say a casual ciao to Annaleise and walk with Jason to the entrance. Along the way he asked me some weird questions about where I was. Apparently I "cracked the shits and left". I pointed out that when I  "crack the shits" people   bleed  .  I wish I spoke Spanish.

      Well, it seems the new graphics driver is just as annoying as the previous ones, blinking on and off whenever it seems to feel the need to. Problem is, I kept all the install files, and I cant remember the name of the one that I actually liked.  Great. Thanks NVIDIA!

      It was 5:30 pm when I stopped what I was doing and realised "Ah, crap, I have psych homework. And I have to write a speech" ARGH!  I contemplated chucking a sickie tomorrow, but we are doing a prac in chem, and if I miss that I'll have to copy someone else's results...  As of now I have done as much psych as I could be bothered (not a lot...) and thought about writing something.  How did I get this far?

      I decided to get rid of the Ask Mustafa thing. It was boring.  As a result my template code is really messy due to all the re-arranging I've done, and the leftovers from the crap I've cut out.  Oh well.  If anyone is slightly more adept at HTML and wants to have a look, or just check the source and point out all the problems then that would be just dandy.

      Just having stayed awake, finished a book that I should have finished loooong ago, probaly for too long the second night in a row.  Is it just me, or is anything beyond 12:30 am while by yourself either creepy (seeing things crawling on the couch seat next to me) or strikingly lonely?  Now I sit in my room, the clock just going over the 1 am mark, henpecking away at this keyboard, The Simpsons playing in the background.  Sleep will come, but what before it?

      The deranged jackhammer on heat returned to my skull this afternoon, rather peeved at being left out of the loop for 1 whole day.  You would think staring at a computer screen wouldn't help, but surprisingly the pain subsides when I sit down and start whatever it is that I do...  Oh yeah, nearly forgot  urlLink The Encyclopedia of Arda  for all your Lord Of The Rings needs.

      As I sit here, typing in a sleep deprived stupor, my mind wanders to the fates of the deb and after-party goers. And I laugh. Because no matter how bad I feel, I always know there are some chug-monkeys worse off.  Hangovers, meth crashes, and morning sickness pale my condition.  So I continue to laugh.  And remember the law to life- "There's always someone suffering more than you, make sure to mock their very existence."

      I regret it. I always do. What, you ask? Not doing something. I usually have the opportunity or the means to do something on Friday night, but never do. I think its eating at my brain.  But, all will be well, if it doesn't rain, by around 1 am I will know if daz will be here. If so, cool, if not, I've wiled away the hours by blogging and waiting, rather than blogging and being strange.  Perhaps sleep deprivation will make this more interesting. I will post throughout the night. To eat the boredom.  Oh yeah, don't forget to check out my new postings at Swashagunga's Realm (link over there>>> somewhere). They arent good, but I made the effort!

      I consider myself as a servant of the people (namely: me, myself and I), so I decided to see what shaving gel was like in comparison to the foam crap. Well, my results were astounding! The gel at times appeared to be clogging the razor, but despite this I got the closest and smoothest shave I have had in years (being a moot... I havent been shaving for years). So I concluded: What the hell is wrong with me?

      This morning, those kids next door were at it again. Playing basketball. At nine-o'clock in the bloody morning!!! After 20 minutes of trying to ignore it, I gave up and went into the lounge room, where I could still hear it. Turning on the tv enraged me more, because some crummy cheap cartoon was on, which will be the subject of a different rant... Three minutes later, the basketball noises stop.  I have decided to write a note in blood, and then nail it to their precious basketball.  That'll teach 'em for inadvertantly irritating me!

      Ok, all you freaky stuff buffs, intellectuals, pseudo-intellectuals, and anyone basically.   urlLink Here is a weird game.  I use the word "game" very loosely- it is a series of clues that leads you to the next page...  In the source of the first page "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here" can be found near the bottom... this is part of the inscription on the gates of hell.  And when you rollover the image that links to the next page, text reads "run now".   Comment if you need help, or have gotten past the truck page.. thats as far as I got.

      I remember the days of violence and sex scenes- these were the days when people accpeted the norms and the "ok's" in society. But what is happening now? &nbsp; I am of course speaking of  tampon ads.  I remember ads with blue liquid, and some happy and comfortable women. As inaccurate as this may be, I didn't care. But these lines must always be pushed, to test the limits of society. When we learn that these products are smooth "for easier  insertion " I just think we may have gone over the limits in good taste. &nbsp; But what does the future hold? Condom ads, with specific and graphic recitations of their use, perhaps? An abortion institution, with details on how exactly they kill the fetus? &nbsp; Or worse yet... tiolet paper ads...

      Stupid abbreviations/acronyms  prejudicely  associated with the internet. And in some cases text messaging. Who cares about that though? Any real&nbsp;"computer user" (I use the term  real  about as ambiguously as the word hacker) can spell without taking a massive amount of time to do so.  Top&nbsp;5 annoying examples:  1.  Wif.  Oh my god, that  ONE EXTRA LETTER  you didn't type must have saved you ages.  2.  WTF?  What is wrong with just typing "what the fuck?" it isn't that hard, and it has more impact. Test it-&nbsp;say to&nbsp;your boss/teacher/warden "W-T-F?", gauge their reaction, then say "What the FUCK?" and compare.  3.  OMG.  I'm pretty sure this exists because most people who go in chat rooms aren't sure about whether to type "o" or "oh", and the spelling of the word "my".  4. Dun.  I don't even know what this means. You would think it was short for "Done" but if it is, the context in which it often appears proves that the people who write it are stupider than I thought. Which is bloody stupid.  5.  Boi/gurl.  I dont understand the motivation, other than to spell something differently than someone with a  positive  IQ would. The same amount of letters is used, and the keys are   at most 6 mm closer   on the keyboard. Given the way these people type, I don' think it makes a difference anyway.  &nbsp;  Well, I'm done with that.  Until it annoys me again.

But now I realise, that practially no one likes you anyway, so just do whatever pops into your head at convinient opportunities.  So, go ahead, bugger up society even more by being weird! At least most of us will be happy! Or insane! But I reckon insane people are happy in their insane world most of the time, so try being insane for a while!!!!!

      It's soul-crushing, it's boring, it's essentially useless, but school actually must be the most important thing in a person's life.  Childhood and through adolescence are referred to as the "best years of your life". We spend most of our years struggling to live up to everyone's expectations- whethere these be to succeed, or to be weird, or to exist on the edge of everything, ghosting about. So, school must be something...  But for now, I'll settle with a simple "I hate school"

      Well, back to school and I have to say it is worse than ever.

      Long time no blog eh? Got caught up in the lazy sloth-like routine of the "holidays" and I apologise for that.  I have been busy though. I revamped Swashagunga's Realm (Now Apotheosis of Something) and added some new material. Now all I need is someone to visit it...  My sister is moving to Melbourne, which opens up another bunch of options for my tertiary schooling plan. Still don't know what I want to do though... I got to thinking, I know people with willpower and motivation and pure desire to achieve powerful enough to just rattle my sense of myself. I have talents, not bragging, but I don't try very hard. I could accomplish more, but I started getting all funky "Why me?". It's like in Spiderman 2, where Otto Octavius tells Peter something like "you can't be a lazy turd just coz your smart". Maybe a little more eloquent, but who cares? You got the gist.  Anyhoo, expect slightly more regular posts (despite all the stuff I have left to do... anyone know anything about the Human Genome Project?) I don't know why, maybe my small sense of motivation kicked in. And I realised I can type way faster than I ever could.  Down with pens!

      Oh yeah, that's right, I was supposed to be posting on my blog... Well, here's a post!  Recently got an e-mail from the geocities people saying that they would delete my site if I didn't update it, so I slapped together something about Santa being evil. Enjoy! The link is over there somewhere, you know...  The bathroom is  actually  finished now. Nothing beats the sensation of not having to go into the cold outdoors to have a nice warm shower.  And at last count I have to read about 5 novels over these 2 weeks, of which I have in my posession 1, and of which I have finished none, so don't be surprised (whoever you are...) if I don't post very often.  Going to see Spiderman 2 tomorrow. My brother said it was boring and crap, so I'm expecting a good film!  Oh, and can anyone tell me who is having the phone conversation at the end of the Outro for the  urlLink Limp Bizkit  Album, Hot Dog Flavoured Water and the Chocolate Starfish?

      Sorry posting has been light- have actually been busy (or the me equivalent of busy) for the past few days. The main pc commited suicide, and is now being formatted. So luckily for me everyone gets to come into my room whenever they want to "use the internet".  I have decided to unplug the network cabel, ever so slightly, and say "Oh dear, the internet server must be down. What a shame" and then continue to use it for my own good.  Buwahhahahah!

      Ah, the joys of school excursions. There are few better ways to spend a whole day then drive for three hours in a cramped, old, 28-seater bus filled with semi-evolved donkeys whos' cumulative IQ is equal to that of a dead badger (along with the smell) and holding the firm belief that throwing anything they can get their deranged little hands on at the various people sitting in front of them.  Once at our destination, we listened to much painful feedback from some large speakers, and then some strange girl singing in a pitch to envy a banshee our  lovely  national anthem, followed by a "motivational speaker" (note inverted commas) who spent half of the time talking about reading palms to set us up for some demented "Haha! You can't predict your life, but you can control it!" spiel, which by the way I realised he was going to do from the beginning, being the wonderfully insightful person I am. What? Anyway, we were then granted leave to go about and look at various miniature propaganda centres (Stickers saying "I love Virgin"?? C'mon, give us some credit... although  lots  of people were wearing them...) for us to peruse to clarify our career choice. There were a few problems with this, mind you. The first being that along with our band of semi-sentient inbreds, there were hosts of other rather intimidating students, walking around in huddled masses, all desperately trying to see how many trees-worth of brochures, pamphlets, and delightful booklets they could cram into several oversized, logo encrusted plastic bags in less than 180 minutes. The second, and possibly more unnerving problem was the spin-doctors and patsys, and bagmen representing these various institutions. Imagine the strange, ambiguoius-specied, hairy smelly and "colourful" characters we can see running stalls and rides at the local show. Now give them some sort of tertiary training, a fair amount of subtle brainwashing and a good clean scrub, and you are starting to imagine the creepy unnaturalism of these mutants.  I don't know about the average 17-year-old, but attempting to physically force upon me some piece of garbage or another with a creepy barney-the-dinosaur-smile with their eyes twitching in an unsetttling manner is hardly encouragement to "join the team" and seek to gain employment/enrolment in their psychotic industry/education institute. As fulfilling as the employment expo turned out to be, we were met with more excitment! That's right, a tour of the Telstra Dome! I try to refrain from profanity in writing, as it can draw from my message and/wit, so I'll say this.  It was crummy. We somehow managed to spend over an hour walking, then hobbling, and finally dragging ourselves forward with the one thought of finally get away, touring about what is essentially and indoor football oval. Sure, you can get drunk with more expensive booze, you can watch Foxtel on a moniter instead of the game, and you can attempt to spit on players that have displeased you, but this does not change the simple fact: Telstra Dome is a big oval with a roof. Pants-wetting exctitement. Thankfully (there is a God...!) the day had taken a toll on some of the less promising candidates for Human Citizenship, and thus their ability to make  hilarious  jokes and noises was somewhat taxing and they had to take rests that comprised of making slightly less noise. The moment I stepped off that bus, I looked at my watch and realised I had been awake for nearly  twelve hours  and I had accomplished nothing other than a more grumbling temperment, a  lower  esteem for everyone, and an upset stomach. So I thought,  "Dave, you gotta write  something "

      SOrry about light posting, I was attacked by a rabid wombat! Not really, but I think I went mildly insane.  You'd think I would have stacks of things to post, and I probably do but at the moment I can't actually remember any of them...  So, it should come to me soon...  Also, I have to get up before 7:00 am tomorrow! Shock horror! Then I get to spend 3 hours on a busload of freaks, and then walk around for a few hours, then another bus trip! Weeeeeee!

       urlLink This whole craze  is getting kind of freaky.  I am so glad I did it, and my curiosity has been fulfilled. I believe I will suspend again one day, but I have no need to in the near future. When I do suspend again, now I know what the feeling is like, I can concentrate on having fun while in the air!   Meat hooks, skin, and fun are very hard to fit into the same sentence. Erk.

      TV Despite being a professinal slob, I have come to hate television. It's all mind numbing and vomit inducing.  So now I have to rely on the Internet for meaningful, useful and informative sensory data. After reading that you are all assured that I am insane.  Of course.

      Much to my pleasent surprise, The Others was advertised as being on tonight. So of course, I wanted to tape it. But theres a hiccup. A tv show on the abc is being taped for  someone who doesn't live here . The tape was bought especially for this purpose, and an entire trip to the supermarket was based on this need. Last time I asked for a tape to record some  quality  broadcasting, such as  Frasier , all I get is a "Don't we have any other tapes?" Oh, silly me, I asked for a tape WHEN I DIDN'T NEED ONE!!!! Anyway, I endeavoured to find out how long this program was going to go. And in the meantime I thought I might as well transpose some of my indignancy. My answer is "It finishes at 8:30 I think." Thank you so much. And why is the vcr I use being used to record such mindless drivel that would appear on a Sunday night on ABC? Because it's the only one connected to a tv that gets reception. You would think a multi-k dollar home entertainment system would be granted a  humble video cassette recorder  but no. So I'm writing this.  Also, what's the point in notifying which students are the top ten in their year level, without telling them what position? Enough information to exclude and potentially  damage  other students, but not enough to gloat over the other contestants for the fabled  best in the whole god damned year level  position.  I tell you, the world is screwy.
