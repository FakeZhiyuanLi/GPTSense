						   Who else is sick of this pollitically correct bullshit! I AM!!! In my previous blog I moan about how the girl prayed in maori before we ate... guess what i just found out! Its LEGAL (or so i am told) It is legal for MAORI prayers to be said in school but not other religions...why is that? Because otherwise it would be RACIST to put a halt to there culture! They are seriously pushing the boundries a mile ahead of what is basic pollitical correctness and reverse racism! You know what i mean right? Giving a certain race benifits because they are scared of being accused of RACISM!I mean what next...I wouldn't be suprised if next thing you know it will be legal for maoris to eat their neighbours! I mean it is part of there culture right? So who are we to stop it? I tell you who! We are the people who civilised these savages...they wouldnt exist if it wasnt for us contributing races...now I know this isn't entirely pollitically correct but i dont care. I am just using my right to freedom of speech! Of course you get the occasional maori who Is a genuinely cool guy...and I am sorry to those of you who are offended by this. But you other 99% of maori can read this and maybe realise what EVERYONE else thinks...well everyone apart from the people scared to admit what they think....Many wazzle woggles! Peace!

						   Waikato sunrise rotary club put on a seminar for us... free food and a day with out heavy school work? SWEET! Anyway we turn up and these rich ass business type people would lecture us on the ways they got rich. It was boring as hell but then we got to have muffins for "morning tea" (oh so posh) happily munched on those and socialised for half an hour but then it was back to the workshops. The workshops were filled with basic common sence bullshit like how to have an interview...what to put in your C.V. etc but lunch finally came! The food looked so good! We were ready to munch but then this fucking maori teacher was like "alright time to pray!" I go upto this teacher and explain to him that prayer is illegal at public school but he didnt give a shit. then this fucking coconut/maori girl said the prayer in maori! ARGH!! I hate that girl..she is in love with the sound of her own voice. At least the food was good...I got no doughnuts though coz it was "ladies first" and all the fat coconut girls who dont usually get food pilled up there plate! Argh they piss me off...after the munch had lectures from more rich people and then left......rest of the day was un-eventful so im not gonna bother boring you with it

						   Today I won some girly haircare products...Yippy!...haha "Here mum I got you a present"...easy way to keep folks happy...bribery...aaaaanyway. I jumped on the bus today and there were no free seats so I sat next to this maori girl. As soon as I sit down she releases a sigh of disgust or something, anyway she obviously didn't like the fact that a quiet white guy was sitting next to her. So this "overly nice" samoan guy or somethin offers me the seat next to me after hearing this chicks sound and starts makin small talk...it seemed as if he thought I needed to be comforted but it just made me feel awkward and weird so as soon as a seat freed up on the bus I jumped to it. Pleasant journeys... Who else hates public transport? waggle wiggly

						   You ever been so passionate about something you believe that its the only right thing. It seems that even though I know everyone is different and that is one of the beauties of this earth I cant handel the fact that pop music is sooo popular...dur its pop...but you know what I mean right? Mindless shit like eminem and all the other mainstream 'music'. I wont even acknowledge it as being music...I guess its like religion...which I am also heavily against...everyone KNOWS they're right...the difference is that I know I'm right...or do I?...I am such a hypocrite...lol

						   Man its been a while since I've written a post, there's two reasons, the first being I am very lazy and procrastinate heaps, secondly I've been in nelson...Its a wicked place but I didnt get to see everyone I wanted to....fuck im bored tonite, its depressing. I might go to bed and read Kurt Cobains journals....they are very cool....sort of lets u get inside his head and gives you a chance to try and figure him out. He is an amazing guy, he is a genious. You would think reading a journal would be boring but the stuff he writes is amazing. Alot of it funny, alot of it sad. argh im really not in the mood for writing shit in here right now...im too bored to do anything! Sometimes i get so bored all motivation and ambition goes out the window...thats probably why I do so poorly at school, its so boring my mind turns off and I cant be fucked doing anything so i just sit there and muck around...the school wants to have a meeting with my mum...ARGH its not like it will have any effect, just make me have awkward meetings with teachers where they ask me retarded questions like "what do you think could help you?" IF I KNEW WHAT COULD HELP ME I DONT YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN USING IT BY NOW!!! eegh stupid people annoy me (theres a difference between un-motivated and stupid) My career in life doesnt seem like its going to be very succesful considering I want to be a chef but i have the most retarded cooking teacher in the WORLD. Egh I've run out of cds to listen to...I'm so bored of everything, Im just bored in general, it sucks its the last friday of the holidays! OH WELL *sigh* I'm off to bed, I'll tidy in the morning

Whats to say... everything is running smoothly....well sort of....well not really but meh shit happens! Dont you hate it when you know you have missed things...I think i would be much happier if i didnt hear that last 5 minutes of that interview with corey taylor on the generator on tuesday night....i mean fuck! That genious gave a 25 minute interview and i only got the end...Theres probably some flash saying for it but i dont know any but who cares. You know what I mean...Right? Who cares....Thursday thursday thursday...Sooo close to friday! mmmm friday...party tommorow...Isn't that lovely?....argh the fucking cd is skipping! O well hopefully wont happen again...trust library cds...some people are so fucking careless, I wanna be a radio guy...they interview peoples...cool peoples like Justin Hawkins and Corey Taylor...o welly!
