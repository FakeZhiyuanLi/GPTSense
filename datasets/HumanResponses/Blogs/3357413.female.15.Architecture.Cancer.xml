      Ahhh....today was a boring day. Like every other stupid day. I did laundry, played sims, and i went to waffle house and celebration station with my wigger brother. I hate people, sometimes I think Im not human, my brother says im not. I know im not the only one who hates most people atleast. Me and Scott(bro) had played video games and got tickets then put them in a machine that turns to a coupon. Well I got them and we went to the front counter then this kid asked me if I took his coupon which I didnt then I just ignored him. Then this old ass wrinkly lady walked up and asked if I took it. then she started yelling at us saying shit like "Who would take tickets from a kid", "That was his coupon", and "Im telling the manager" Then she told the ticket redeeming lady and I guess she gave her some tickets cause she got stuff. My bro got angry and wanted to knock her out. I was fucking about to jump on her and fucking punch the shit out of her piss-stained granny panties. She was all old and wrinkly, with her saggy clit and old saggy ass. Im killing myself before I get old. Why do people always blame stuff on teenagers, stupid fuckers! Not u personally, unless u would do this. Wow, i got this out, thanx (unless ur the old saggy clit lady then FUCK U)Fuckers....okay now im good, I watched Half Baked and curled up in my furry cheetah blanked and drunk some mountain dew livewire. Im rich, bitch. Sorry for language, children.

      Hi. Welcome to my darkness. My name is Selene Papillion. It means the devil of bats and shadows. well......thats my vampire name. I got it off of http://www.emmadavies.net/vampire. I dont know why it turned into that but I like my name. Right now Im watching Willard. Its a pretty good movie and Crispin Clover is very sexy. I had Honey Nut Cherrios this morning. Tastes like crap, who eats that anyways..... If you must know more about I am about 5'10", I have dark brown/black hair. I have fair skin and bright blue eyes. Right now Im in High School but that doesnt mean Im anything like those idiotic masses. I have an appetite for the strange and I wish to become a Vampyre. Vampire is the way others spell it but Vampyre is the true form of it. I was born in the United States in the South, but Id prefer to live in England, France, or even New Zealand. After graduating High School My friend Eleni and I will go backpacking to those places and she wants to go to South Africa. Who knows why? If you must know even more you can email me at SweetBlood@rock.com. Well.....thats all for now and Ill write more later.. Hate me, Love me, But miss me when Im dead, Selene
