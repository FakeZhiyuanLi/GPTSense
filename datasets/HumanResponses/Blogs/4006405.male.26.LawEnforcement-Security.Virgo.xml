       Ever get paint on the clothes of your department's director? Yeah, that's how my night went. Maybe I should start carrying a bucket of cold water with me? Just in case I see the need to drown myself on a moment's notice.

       Have you ever noticed how what one generation grew up with becomes kitsch for the next generation? Today, I went shopping for a Messenger Bag (ended up having an eye exam instead, but that's a different story). In my search, I walked by two displays. One was an Old Navy display that had old Route 66 type slogans and adverts on them. The type of things my parents would have seen on television as they were watching 1950's TV. The second was a Hot Topic display. On sale there were t-shirts advertising Transformers, not the new crappy show mind you, but the old, "Me Grimlock, you lunch" Transformers. Somehow, I wonder why kids, and let's face it, if anyone over the age of 14 walked into a Hot Topic for any other reason than to apply for a job, I'd be amazed; would want to wear a t-shirt from a show they've never seen. Maybe I'm just getting old.

       Yesterday, I really had the urge to get out of my ridiculously small apartment and go somewhere. So, I decided to head downtown and visit Chinatown. After all, I hadn't been to Chinatown in while and figured I could pick up some good Pot Stickers. Okay kiddies, the next time I get the urge to go somewhere, for God's sake, please shoot me.       Within 5-minutes of walking in through the Grant Street entrance, I realized why it had been so long since my last visit.... the Tourists. Yes, the dreaded Tourists. And since it's summer over here in the States, that means that a whole mess load of Tourists, complete with little brats, were running around, going in and out of the shops screaming their little lungs off.       "Mommy, Daddy, I want one of these."     "Uh, honey, that's not a toy."     "But look, it says Hello Kitty on it, and it vibrates!"     *stoned silence*     (NB: I actually overheard this conversation)       Next time I go to Chinatown, I'm going at night, for food, or the Chinese New Year parade.

       They're small, colored, although the old ones are mostly white, and hold vast amounts of music, information, and even some games. In my life, I've seen some great things: The personal computer, the Internet, the Mariners with a winning season, the rise and fall of the PDA, cellular phones, readily available Anime in the US, another winning season for the Mariners, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, free webcomics, Spider-Man 1 and 2, etc, etc....       But the I-Pod is the first that I've never wanted to leave home without. Easy to use, easy to update, convenient, and well, cool. I feel 10+ cooler just wearing one and I'm one of those people who projects an invisible shield that automatically repels people. I'm not even that big of a Mac person (though I do admit a secret love for their laptops). Too damn cool. On the other hand, maybe it's just because it's still a relatively new toy for me. Maybe, after a few months, I'll get tired of it and relegate it to the "there but barely used pile of electronics." Then again, maybe not.         On a completely unrelated note. I'm wondering if the the term "Windows XP" isn't a code of some sort. Something like XP stands for eXperience Points and windows is a English translation for the number of points needed to de-bug the damn system, which would be: 239,144,152,319 eXperience Points. Crap, I don't think I'm there yet.     Today's link:  urlLink  Fun with Music

       I'm at work right now, which means that I shouldn't be typing this. Quite frankly, I don't care, no one here is every going to see this anyhow. Now, how can I put this.... I'm bored, bored, bored, bored, bored, bored.   Working nights is a pain in the arse. Working nights on the weekends is like getting violated in places where the sun does not shine. I could be out on the town, meeting girls, having fun, drinking heavily, but no; I'm here, at work, high on caffeine, and full from Chin... oh, crap, someone's coming in.     5-minutes later: Okay, he's gone. Anyway, as I was saying: high on caffeine and full from the plate of Chinese style Pot Stickers. My supervisor is giving a promotion's test, so I'm basically running the show for the time being, which is cool, except that I'd rather be getting a lot more money for the job. Late.     &nbsp;   01:23, 07/25/2004&nbsp; Sometimes, I really hate this job. Everything was nice and quiet and then.... boom! I've spent the last hour on the phone and radio talking back and forth, basically acting as a go-between for three different groups of people. There are times when I wish I could just roll over and go to sleep, sleepy, sleepy, sleep.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *zzzzzzzzzzzzzz*

       You ever have one of those days where you just can't go to sleep? No matter how tired you are? It is now 10:17 on a Saturday morning and I've been up since 05:00 on Friday. In between, I've closed my eyes for about 20-minutes.... tops. I'm so tired that the world is spinning and everything is begining to fall apart before my very eyes. The 6th Cav painting above my futon... upside down. The Irish flag, now starting to look vaguely British.      Okay, so It's partially my fault. I mean, I supposed I could go to sleep if I just lay my head down on my pillow and closed my eyes. Two problems. One: Caffeine. I have more caffeine in my veins than blood. This isn't a new problem mind you. It's just one that affects me from time to time.     Two:   urlLink  Strange Candy.      This comic will kill your brain, and make you laugh hysterically. Or, just fall on the floor and roll around for a while.      That's it, I'm going to go and read some more.... maybe, if I'm really lucky, unconsciousness will overtake me sometime in the near future.... maybe.

       Welcome. If you're reading this, which, I have to presume you are, then you've stumbled upon my blog. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't have much to say right now besides two things:         I'm drunk, and it's 17:55 hours on a Thursday, suprised I can still type?         Idependence Day is a really corny movie. Did you know that Will Smith was offered the part of Neo. Can anyone really see Smith-san saying "There is no spoon."?     Well, that's it for today. Check back later, maybe I'll feel like posting more. Until then, enjoy.

       Lately, I've become obsessed with finding wallpapers for my desktop. I already had a whole mess of them, but with the recent revival of   urlLink  4Chan   and my more recent re-discovery of   urlLink iichan  , I've been downloading them off of image boards like there's no tomorrow. It's almost sickening. In the past week, I've changed my desktop wallpaper and layout at least twice. Though, I think I'm finally happy with the current layout... at least for another week or two.      I've remove all my shortcut icons except for the Recycle Bin (which Windows XP won't allow me to remove) and pinned the shortcuts I use the most to my "Start" menu. One: it allows me to see more of my desktop, which is nice since I use a 1280x1024 pixel image on my screen. Two: It looks better. I've always hated shortcut icons. Despite their hadiness, I've always preferred having as few on my desktop as possible. Sadly, I'm using a lot more programs on a frequent basis then I was when I first started using 'puters.  Ergo, I've been having to use a lot more shortcuts. But, I finally decided to just pin them to the menu. I realize this is pointless, but quite frankly, I was downloading a new program and I was bored. Late.

      So, it's been a while since I wrote anything in this blog. For this, I apologize. Of course, I don't know why I'm apologizing, since I don't actually think anyone reads this blog. So, if you do, I'm sorry. You may ask, to what am I apologizing? Well, both.... for not writing, and for you reading this blog.  I just took a new job. It' s not bad. The pay is about the same, but it's a regular job, which is nice.  Anyway, it's supposed to run for about 9- hours a day. This has been my first week. Total, I've worked 43-hours and there's still one-day left in the week. I'm exhausted... E.X.H.A.U.S.T.E.D..  Anyway, I'm going away now. Bye.

       I got a new job. It's at the same place, but it's an actual, honest-to-goodness Monday thru Friday job. I mean, the 3 and 4-day weekends were great, but it would be kinda nice to actually have Saturday and Sunday off like everyone else. Not to mention that it's really hard to meet a member of the female persuassion when you're work schedule is bucked the hell up. I mean, imagine the conversation:      Me: "So, you want to go out this week?"    Her: "Sure, how about Saturday night?"    Me: "Uh, that won't work, I work on Saturday night, every Saturday night."    Her: "Loser."      And there endeth the conversation.

       I bought a new bag today, after my previous "cheap as hell, on sale from the Gap" bag failed to fufill it's general purpose; namely, not tearing my neck from my shoulders. The new bag is a nice large flapdoozy tech from a NY based store called YakPak, but's that not important, I just figured that someone out there might want to check out their on-line store,  urlLink YakPak.com ; anyway, my previous bag shopping trips have been fairly simple expiditions, go to Target, or some other equally generic place and buy whatever was on-sale at the time. However, this bag was different. I put research into this bag. I Googled examples from the web, compared prices, shopped around for what was in the City, compared features, and finally, posted notes on forums and IRC channels to see if there was any feedback. In short, I put work into finding this bag.    I did all this because it came to me that I really need a bag, just for daily living. It carries my various notebooks, pens, pencils, calculator, cleaner for my glasses, whatever book I happen to be reading at the time, my cell phone, and my I-pod (see http://thisthinghere.blogspot.com for my love of I-pods), among other items. All of which are pretty much essential for my "21st century digital-boy" lifestyle; (first person who can tell me where that quote came from wins a... nice e-mail). if I had a laptop, it would go in there as well, and the only reason I don't have a laptop is that I have other things that I need to spend $1000 on, not that I want to, but some things are inevatable, like new timing belts.    The point of this seemingly pointless e-mail is this: Congratulations ladies, you won. Equality is here, men now can not live without bags to carry all our shit.

       I'm tired........, so tired........, I'm tired of being here, so tired. I'm spread......, so thin........., I don't know where I am...      Actually, I do; and that's the problem. I've had a total of 5 hours of sleep in the past 48 and it's starting to wear on me. Like today. I went to bed at around 09:00 or so (when you work a grave shift, one's sleep schedule is a mess). Anyway, that seemed like a good time to crash out, but then woke up about 3-hours later and couldn't get back to fucking sleep. So now, I want to sleep, but of course I can't since I'm working. I know, I'm just whining, but dammit, you'd whine if you'd been up too  bloody  long too!
