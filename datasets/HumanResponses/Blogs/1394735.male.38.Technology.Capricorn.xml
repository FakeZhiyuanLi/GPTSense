       My sites went dead yesterday after nearly 4 years of mostly free hosting by my friend Dan in Michigan.  Lifeseller.com and Soupyet.com are cut off from the rest of the world.  They are penned up in the dark electronic cage of a server called helen in Charlotte, Michigan.  Dan said he was going to try to get a new connection, but it will probably be something slower than the one we previously had.  So, here I am.  Relegated to emptying my mind and thoughts on a free blog site.  This is so humiliating.  It's like a guy who has worked as a high-tech consultant for years and then the gig ends and he has to work bussing dishes at TGIFridays.  That's all for now.  I've got tables to clear.

       I read  urlLink Senator Orrin Hatch's statement regarding the inducement of children to commit crimes through P2P networks  and found it disturbing.  Let's apply Sen. Hatch's "logic" to another industry, automotive.  Any company that builds a car which can travel faster than 75 mph and markets it in the USA may be violating the law.  Certainly if that company shows commercials of these vehicles traveling at higher than legal speeds, they are "inducing" me to copy that behavior.    Of course the advertisement will contain a disclaimer about how you shouldn't copy this type of driving.  But Kazaa also carries a disclaimer that says you shouldn't do anything illegal with their software.  The really ludicrous part of Hatch's argument is that he is the one exploiting the children for his own political purposes.  If his argument was sound he wouldn't have to resort to the age old tactic--the same one Miletus used in accusing Socrates--of corrupting our children.  Don't dismiss Sen. Orrin "Miletus" Hatch outright.  Remember, Socrates lost his trial.

       I've been dreaming of fishing for quite a while now.  I'm sure these are deep symbolic dreams, because they recur so often and seem to have some vivid themes.  Last night I dreamed that I was fishing, first, in a deep clear pool or lake.  I could see the fish I was trying to catch.  In my mind I kept refering to it as a long-nosed gar, which is odd because that fish lives in the muddy Mississippi river, not clear deep lakes.  The other thing that was odd was that the fish I could see, although it did have the long snout you would expect, was a pearly white and had a blow-hole like a dolphin.  I was fishing for it with a white plastic jig.  I saw the fish take my lure but when I tried to set the hook, it came flying up out of the water.  The tail of the jig was chewed off and what remained seemed dirty.  Next, I was fishing in a muddy pond.  I had an enormous lure on my line with a single hook.  As soon as I cast it out, I had a strike.  I set the hook and battled the fish ashore.  I knew it was a big fish by the way my pole bent over.  When I finally got the fish out of the water it was covered in weeds.  I pulled the weeds off and revealed the biggest goldfish I wave ever seen.  It was a redish-gold color and was hooked quite soundly on the single hook.  What stands out most to me is the incongruity of the fish in this dream.  They are too big, the wrong color, in the wrong places, they take the wrong bait.  Any thoughts on an interpretaion?  Fishing seems like an obvious motif.  I'm looking for something in my life.  But why all the odd fish in odd places?  Am I looking in the wrong places?

       I live on the east bank of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis.  I work in downtown Minneapolis, so most days I just walk to work.  It takes about 20 minutes.  Sometimes I see some interesting things during my walk to or from work each day.  This morning I saw the following:  A condom, still in the package A bright red pair of womens thong underpants 3 bottles of tanning lotions/oils A carving knife with the blade broken off halfway down

       Edward M. Kerry, younger brother of Democratic presidential nominee, John F. Kerry was questioned this morning after reporting that he had driven his car off the Chappaquiddick Island bridge the previous night.    The body of Mary Jo Karpinski was found in the back seat of the vehicle by divers called to the scene.  Although in Massachusetts, a manslaughter charge is always given when someone leaves the scene of a deadly accident, John F. Kerry said that there is precedence for notable public figures and their families to receive little or no punishment in cases like this.  "I attempted to open the door and window of the car but I have no recollection of how I got out of the car. I came to the surface and repeatedly dove down to see if the passenger was still in it. I was unsuccessful in the attempt. I was exhausted and in a state of shock and I recall that I was able to get back to some friends who had a car parked in front of the cottage. I asked someone to bring me back to Edgartown. I remember walking around for a period of time and when I suddenly realized what happened, I immediately called the police," the younger Kerry said.  Kerry had been driving back from a party on Chappaquiddick, with the young, attractive Karpinski. Kerry's wife was home with their children and had not attended the party.

       In the movie "The Transporter" there is a scene where Frank is washing his car and a TV is heard in the background.  The following dialog can be heard:  [Voices On Television] Really I did. Oh, yeah, well, how come...you don't have your yellow card with you? Well, I... I...must've left it back in Nam on the base. Yeah, they all say that."Left it back in Nam on the base."  Uh-huh. Let me show you what we do to people...who left it back in Nam on the base. Oh, no! Please let go of me! Where are you taking me? You gotta be punished for not carrying...your shot record on you. It's a fate far worse than death. [Voices Become Indistinct]  Two questions:  What movie or TV show is this dialog from?  Why is it in the Transporter movie?  Things don't usually make it onto movie soundtracks by accident.  Anyone know if there is some inside story here?

        urlLink Yahoo! News - Analysts: Economy Headed for Fast Growth   This story cracks me up.  You've got economists trying to predict the election based on economic factors.  That's about as ridiculous as letting a groundhog predict the weather.  These economists are so focused on what they are doing (counting beans), that they can't see the real factors which will determine the outcome of the election.  America is pretty polarized, thanks to the Demicans and Republicrats.  Those sane people who choose not to belong to a political party are lumped into what is called "the swing vote."  So, what makes these people swing?  Now, I'm not talking here about those morons who choose not to involve themselves for whatever reason in the political process.  I'm talking about those individuals who actually think.  Yes, think.  These "swing voters" don't just mark a ballot because it has a picture of an elephant or donkey next to it.  They research a candidate's stand on the issues most important to them, then they vote for the one which aligns most closely with their position.  They hope that enough of their fellow Americans have the same views and that the government which emerges after the election will be truly representative of the majority opinion.  What a concept.  A representative democratic republic.  Of course if everyone voted this way, there would be no such thing as "swing votes."  There would certainly be more than two political parties.  And the good ole US of A would become the democracy that our founders envisioned.  As it stands today, we have on of the weakest democracies in the world.  So weak, in fact, that economists actually believe that they can predict the outcome of an election by reading their tea leaves.

        urlLink I wrote this story and song this year.   It all came upon me rather suddenly, like William Blake's spirit is haunting me, trying to round up more interest in his work.  So the other night I was watching "Castle in the Sky" with my son and I had a strong impression that this story would make a great animated movie.  The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that is what I should do.  Obviously the story needs more work to make it a successful animated movie, but I've already begun addressing that issue.  My problem/question is, "How do I go about getting the job done?"  I have no experience in film-making.  I certainly don't have the capital required to launch a major production of this sort.  Any advice would be appreciated.

       The most efficient engine known to man is the human body. It can go great distances on small amounts of fuel. Fuel can be readily found along its route. And it even knows how to store excess fuel in a manner that keeps it ready almost indefinitely. The waste produced by the human body, while not exactly pleasant, is certainly not noxious to the environment and is, in fact, fairly easily recycled into new sources of fuel. And yet, for all this, we still focus our technical efforts on artificial means of locomotion and scarce, exotic fuel sources. Advances in material sciences and engineering should be able to give us tools to enable the human engine to go farther, faster, higher than ever before. Yet it seems that the best we can do is create hundred dollar running shoes which still do little if anything to increase speed and distance and still wear out after 500 miles of use. Or, if you prefer, the best advances in bicycling technology (one of the most efficient means of propulsion to utilize the human engine) are so expensive and specialized that only the most elite riders of the Tour de France can take advantage of them. One of my own favorite sports, swimming, has only just begun to scratch the surface in hydrodynamic attire. Until recently the thinking was that the closer you were to fully naked, the faster you would swim. The purists will roll over in their graves, but I'd like to see a swimming event which was the equivalent of bicycling. Use anything you like, fins, flippers, paddles, hydrodynamic suits, as long as the human engine remains the sole source of power for propulsion. Could you imagine the swimming equivalent of the Tour de France? It might be the Tour of the South Pacific, with competitors swimming in stages from one island to the next. Leaving sports behind for a moment, let's consider another of man's most basic needs for propulsion: the commute. The number of people who don't rely on motors and fossil fuels to get them to work is so small that it doesn't even bear mentioning. But let's visit some of the pitfalls of such unorthodox modes of travel. I walk to work. I live about a mile and a half from my office in downtown Minneapolis. My commute takes around 25 minutes from door to desk. On very hot and humid days I may arrive with a trickle of sweat running down my back or on my forehead. So what. It isn't enough to make me smell up the office and its usually gone within 30 minutes in my climate-controlled building. On very cold days I arrive ready to wrap my hands around a hot cup of oatmeal (fuel for the commute home). If I lived farther away and wanted to still arrive in 25 minutes or less, I would have to run or ride a bike (or skateboard or wear roller blades, etc.). This would increase my chances of arriving in an unacceptably sweaty mess, unready for work until I showered and changed clothing (adding to the commute time). Engineers please take note. Here is a problem which you should be able to solve. Can you make a self-propelled vehicle which will require the same exertion as walking, but travel twice as fast? Or, if you like, create a fabric that disposes of the sweat in an in-offensive way. Of course you could, if you weren't so busy trying to build a better bomber for the Air Force, or create the perfect niche for a cupholder in that mini-van. Of course, you say, nobody would buy such things. I would. And others will to if you make them so that they can be sold at a profit. Trust that there are marketers out there every bit as good at what they do as you are at what you do. (Marketers, I'll spare you my ire today, but be consider notice has been served.) Sure, this is a rant. But it's a rant with purpose. You always hear people challenging you to think outside the box. Here's a little explored area way outside the box. Not even the Wright brothers believed that the airplane would be commercially viable. Think of the benefits to the environment, to public health, to the economy. Have some faith in what a body can do.&nbsp;

           I made this graphic after getting sick of hearing about John Kerry, the war hero.&nbsp; I'm no fan of George W. Bush, but it's too bad the Democrats couldn't come up with anyone better than this aging fraud for a nominee.  urlLink Click here if you want this on a t-shirt, mug or button.

       I'm interested in putting together a list of physical challenges which have yet to be done.   Here is the criteria:  1.  Can't be exorbitantly expensive.  (Let's set  a starting point, but keep an open mind.  Certainly won't consider multi-million dollar space flights.) 2.  Can't be a matter of quantity alone. (eg. Nobody's won the Tour de France 7 times.) 3.  Can't be something that's so obscure that nobody will care.  (eg. Nobody has ever jumped across Big Beef Creek wearing nothing but pantyhose.) 4.  Can't be illegal.  Any ideas?
