      Being a bank teller is a shitty job.  I’d love to say that it just sucks, or that it’s crappy, but without the actual curse word, it just doesn’t do the situation the justice that it deserves.  SHITTY.  I’d get more vulgar, but then I’d almost seem as if I could advance myself no further than the likes of most of the customers that the poor bank tellers wait on, on an everyday basis.    First of all, bank tellers do not feel as if the customer’s money is their own money.  We don’t care if you want to take out five cents or five million dollars.  However, if there is a problem with your account, for example…THE MONEY ISN’T THERE, then please, don’t suggest that WE did something with it.  I can assure you, we did not.    Secondly, don’t come and ask us for refunds on your own mistakes.  If you have a hundred dollars and you spend two hundred, YES you will receive a fee.  Think of it this way,  the bank is lending you money for being A. Stupid  B. un-mathematical  and C. irresponsible.  They are also covering your ass by paying that business what you owed them, without having the “returned check” charges businesses will hit you with in addition to overdrawn account fees.  Thank the bank for doing that for you…IT’S A BIG FAVOR.  Thirdly, if you open an account in which you receive special privileges for maintaining certain balances, please don’t come in complaining that you received a small fee for falling below those balances. Understand that the privileges received in those “special” plans are NOT given to the people who have the regular checking accounts and don’t receive those fees.  OH, and if you’re in one of those “special” plans because loans are a part of your combined balances, do not…I REPEAT…do not come in and act high and mighty to the tellers because you are in the “most special of all the plans” because we know your game, you own more than your life is worth.    Fourthly, don’t question the tellers as to the jobs they are doing.  If they are slow, or confused, that is one thing…but if we ask you to sign the check, or that we can’t cash it because the date on it is three years ahead of the present date, we are doing our jobs.  Doing anything else would result in our termination…and if we are working as a teller, then we pretty much need our money DAMN bad…so let us do what we are there for.    Fifthly, swearing at us will get you nowhere.  NO, I don’t care if you “fucking wipe your ass” with your check, I’m not going to cash it…and after that I’m pretty sure no one else will either.  NO, I don’t care who your mommy and daddy are, if YOUR account is overdrawn, mommy and daddy probably want nothing to do with it.  If they do, that’s their fault and you’re a spoiled brat.  NO, I will not fill out all of your paperwork, add up your checks and then figure out how much money you need for the weekend.  That is your job, you should be able to figure out your money situation.  We are there to hurry through transactions and get to the next person in line.    Last...and definitely not least, PLEASE don't throw your college education, your masters, your doctorate, your WHATEVER in our faces, and then NOT understand why your deposit is screwed up due to YOUR failure at filling out a deposit slip.  It's a simple task, it shouldn't take more than one time after being shown how to do it to fill it out correctly.  A lot of us bank tellers are college/grad students working our way through, and thinking to ourselves "THANK GOD I'm getting an education, and the common sense of filling out a simple deposit slip".  If you don't know how to do it, just ask, most of us love to show you how to do it, assuming that you'll remember the next time you come in.    I am not a bitch.  Well, I am kind of a bitch, but that's because of situations mentioned in the above commentary.  I believe that all people should take the time to work in some sort of service industry....bank tellers, waiters/waitresses, retail..etc, just to see how HORRIBLE people can truly be.  If ALL people were made to work, or at least try out a service position, I think that the world would be a better place because there would be a lot less assholes bringing workers to tears due to common everyday mistakes and problems.  I think that people would be a lot more understanding of the difficulty of the jobs of the people that service them on a daily basis and that hopefully those assholes would discontinue being, well, assholes.  This is in no way ignorant of the lazy bank teller that sits and picks at her nails, or checks his baseball scores on the internet, or pretends to be on the phone when there is a line out the door.  I hate those tellers too...in fact, those tellers should be made to see what it's like to stand in a god-awful 10 person line and watch the people behind the counters mess around.    What goes around comes around people.  Keep that in mind next time you bitch out the teller (waiter/waitress/attendant/clerk) who wants to be there as little as you do. Tip well, smile, and be kind.  It's not that hard...even if it's a stretch.

      Have you ever had an argument that you believe to be very interesting, and try as you might, anytime you try to argue for that thing that you believe so greatly in, no one cares?  I've decided to present that argument as my first entry into this new world of blogging.    Sad love songs.  I hate them, and I love them.  I can listen to them no matter what the mood I am in.  Does this make me sappy?  Possibly, but I'm down with that.  One song, that will bring me to tears everytime I hear it, is "Can't Make You Love Me" by Bonnie Raitt (forgive me if this isn't the original singer of the song, but it is the version I've always heard).  The lyrics are incredibly simple, let me break them down:    Turn down the lights, turn down the bed Turn down these voices inside my head Lay down with me, tell me no lies Just hold me close, don't patronize - don't patronize me   First time listeners can handle these lines just fine.  Sure the patronizing part stinks a little bit, but like I said, until we know what comes next, we can all stomach these lines just fine.   Cause I can't make you love me if you don't You can't make your heart feel something it won't Here in the dark, in these lonely hours I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power But you won't, no you won't Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't   WOW.  I mean come on.  Complete dejection, but with dignity.  Unrequited love has a way of stinging so hard, Bonnie must know this cuz the way her voice sounds in this song makes me feel her pain. The speaker understands why his/her lover doesn't/can't/won't love back, but it makes it hurt nothing less.  A heart is layed down, and the power of love is present for the speaker...but not for the lover.     I'll close my eyes, then I won't see The love you don't feel when you're holding me Morning will come and I'll do what's right Just give me till then to give up this fight And I will give up this fight    PHEW.  Hiding from the situation makes it better only for the time being, only for the last time.  One last taste of something so powerful, something that can't be acquired, and something that is going to be given up.    The chorus is repeated, and here I go crying again.  I don't  believe that it takes the experience of not being loved in return to appreciate this song.  I've listened to tons of sappy, sad love songs in my day, but this one takes the cake.  Keep in mind, country music is not in my regular play lists, so I could have lots of disagreement based on  the songs of broken down eighteen wheelers and lost dogs, but it is an interesting idea, none the less, to attempt to place one song as the saddest of all.  Did VH1 do this on one of those countdown shows?  Possibly, and I also understand that every song has its own way of cutting people in their own particular ways, but if I have to give an award...Bonnie, you've won it, cuz that song brings me to tears every SINGLE time I hear it.  Ain't music wonderful??  So as I finish this posting, I realize that in the future I might change my mind.  I will mark this time period by expressing that at this time (and for as long as I've known it) that this is the saddest song.  More on other "...EST" songs later......
