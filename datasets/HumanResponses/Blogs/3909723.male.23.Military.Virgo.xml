      It started out to be a nice day...until I got up.  I'm heading out of my room this morning to use the restroom when my room door slams behind me and I catch a glimpse of my wallet on the table.  I yell out a few choice words before heading down to the office to let one of the petty officers open my room up.  I get there and they tell me that the petty officer with the master key card is floating out in the barracks somewhere and to find him.  I'm looking for about half an hour before he finally steps out of a room on the second floor (I suspect he may have been sleeping).  I finally get into my room about 8:40, about ten minutes past the time I'm supposed to be at work.  I call in to tell them the situation when the boss isn't even in, so I ask for the next guy in charge.  He's not even in either.  I get to work late and zone out for half an hour on my work area.      Here's a little up-to-date info for y'all.  I am in the United States Navy and currently am stationed in Kingsbay, Georgia.  I have been in for two and a half years and have two and a half years left, so I'm right at my middle mark.  Do I wanna stay in?  I don't know yet.  I went to school to be a Sonar Technician (ST) on the trident submarine USS Maine (SSBN 741).  I couldn't hack it so now I am on shore duty working for Trident Refit Facility (TRF).  They put me, a computer-schooled technician, to work with a bunch of calibraters who sit around and work in pressure gages, dial indicators, torque wrenches, dial calipers, depth micrometers, outside-diameter micrometers, inside micrometers, etc.  It's just sooo boring some days.  I don't expect the outside world to know what these tools are, nor do I expect to be using any of these.  So now that you have been updated on my situation let's return to this days exciting adventure of Mr. D! I get done spacing out and do my list of things for the day, which could vary from one task to 18 tasks.  Today I continued my task from last week which was printing out some new barcodes for some of the tools that had old or no barcodes.  I'm also obsessive-compulsive so when I do things I like it done my way or I get all bent out of shape and feel incomplete.  If I see a picture on the wall and notice it's crooked I can't help but go over and correct it, or when I get my food from the galley onbase and my rice is touching my peas I seperate the peas from the rice and vice versa.  That's just me though.  Hold up, I gotta read back up to remember what I was talkin about before I started in on my nit-picking.  Ahh, yes.  That was the jizt of my day.  Today I'm supposed to work out but who has time especially after a weekend of boredom.  That made no sense but oh well.  Maybe tomorrow will be a better day.  It is almost 7:15pm and my stomach is growling.  I ate at the galley for dinner but all I ate was mixed vegetables and beef ziti.  At least I think it was beef.  Throw in two slices of white bread and you got yourself a meal!  Woo hoo!!  Go Navy!  I'm gonna sign off now and walk my happy self to the bowling alley for some hot wings or philly cheesesteak sandwich.  Now I'm really hungry.  Of course there will be more...to come, I mean.
