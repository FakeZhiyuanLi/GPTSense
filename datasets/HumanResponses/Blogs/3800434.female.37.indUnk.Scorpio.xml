      The kids are having a hard time adjusting to life without Dad.  Connor had a rage this morning and cycled through his mood swings about 10 times this morning... Never knew what kid I was going to encounter when I talked to him.  I suffered a minor injury to my wrist just before going to the gym to lift... no big deal he's just getting bigger, stronger and more unpredictable.  Have to talk to the doc about adjusting his medication again.  Will try to distract them tomorrow with a trip to the waterpark.  Tire their little heinies out and maybe Mom will get some quiet time tomorrow....  Trying a new way of dealing with the stress -- besides sleep and food -- thought I would hire a personal trainer.  Second session today -- wow am I sore.

      I complain and complain that my kids don't sleep... I wonder where they get it from?  I haven't been able to sleep for the past couple of nights.  I don't even get tired.  I have so much going on in my head right now that when I turn out the lights I just lay there and think... what if????

        I knew he would be leaving... they told us almost three months ago but now that it's so close I don't know if I can handle it.  How do you explain war to your kids?  How do you answer an 11 year old's questions about death?  Or a 3 year old asking every night for a good night kiss from Daddy?  This is going to be the longest year...

      No matter how prepared you think you are, no matter how strong you think you are, nothing can prepare you for the long silence associated with war. Troy called yesterday to tell me they were heading out on a mission and he would not be able to contact me for several days.  Of course, he cannot tell me where he's going, what he's doing or when he'll be able to call again but he DID want to tell me he was heading out.  I understand the need for the secrecy but it doesn't mean it makes me feel any better.    I haven't really slept since we talked.  Last night I kept drifting off only to startle awake thinking I had heard the telephone or a knock at the door.  I just KNEW someone was coming to notify me of some terrible event over there.  I have this constant gnawing in the pit of my stomach, something just telling me that things are not going well, that this is not going to have a good outcome.  Granted, I have never been accused of being an optimist, however, I have always had an exceptional intuition about things -- especially where Troy is concerned.  Regardless of what I do, or think about, I cannot get these tormenting thoughts out of my head.  I watch the evening news with baited breath for news about Afghanistan; I nearly have a heart attack everytime the phone rings or God forbid, if there is a knock at the door!!  I don't know how I'm going to do this for an entire year... and if his tour is extended.... well I just don't know what I'll do then.   I'm taking the kids to a potluck with the rest of the Company families tomorrow afternoon.  Hopefully being around all the other wives will make me feel a little less apprehensive -- or not....  Anyway, I will be much happier when this long silence has ended and Troy calls me to let me know all is well.

      I've had time to think about everything.  All these nights alone after the kids go to bed has given me ample time to reflect on the events of my life.  Through two marriages which have taken over half of my life, I have allowed myself to be the victim.  I have allowed the men I loved to treat me badly and have obviously gained something from it because I never insisted on change.  However, that stubborn me, the me who was content enough with the status quo that she didn't have the courage to make changes has herself - changed.  Rather than dwell on the hurt, the pity and the negativity of the events in my life, I have decided that they will be the stepping stones on which I build my new life.  It does not however mean that my new life will be separate from Troy.  I believe in us, even through the pain, I believe there is something fundamentally good with us and our relationship.  Regardless of the past, I am willing to begin living in today and dreaming and planning for tomorrow.    I will be stronger, however.  There will be no more one-sided efforts to save this marriage.  If he is as willing to make this work as he has said he is, then there is nothing that can keep us from fixing this.  I DO want to be his partner for life.  I DO want to be by his side as our kids graduate, get married, have kids of their own.  We have our dreams, we know our faults, our weaknesses and we need each other to work through them.  When I think about leaving and about being single again... well, I just can't see it.  I cannot envision my future without him.  I cannot imagine having to go to bed each night knowing that I will never again roll over and put my arms around him, or feel his breath on my skin as he falls asleep.  It's hard enough that I'm going to have to suffer through this for the next year --   I will make my life work, I will make my marriage work...

      I never know just when this roller coaster is going to jerk me around.  Connor raged against me for well over 45 minutes today, biting, kicking, hitting, screaming.  Luckily Meghan is programmed well enough by now to know when it starts to go immediately to her room to avoid getting hurt.  When it was all over Connor voluntarily went to his room (which is the request that started the rage) and fell asleep for an hour.  Afterwards, he came down and apologized and was very remorseful.  I called and spoke with his doctor who decided that a medication change was obviously in need.  We completely stopped the depakote since that seemed to be the medication causing Connor so much anxiety and increased the Seroquel both for mood stabilization and sedation.  We'll see how this works.    Troy called early this morning... around 3 am.  He seemed fairly upbeat but claims to be rather lonely.  I suppose that's only to be expected living with hundreds of guys in the middle of the desert!  I'm sending out his care package tomorrow with lots of comfort items, hoping he will see how much I care.  Anyway, if today was any indication of what tomorrow may bring I should try and get some sleep tonite.  I feel the roller coaster speeding up again....

      Apparently Connor isn't the only one who suffers from mood swings anymore.&nbsp; I've really been trying to put all the hurt and bitterness aside because right now there really isn't anything I can do about it.&nbsp; That, and I promised Troy I wouldn't dwell on it and that I wouldn't make it the constant topic of conversation when we are able to talk.&nbsp; Considering it's still so fresh and I feel like the wound is still bleeding, I thought I was doing quite well.&nbsp; Until today...  I took the kids to the waterpark to get some relief from being cooped up with them 24/7 and was actually having a good time, then, out of nowhere all these thoughts just started racing through my mind... what does she look like? did he think about me at all? how did it make him feel to hear the CD full of love songs I had burned for him for his going away gift?  did he feel guilty at all BEFORE he knew I found out?  did he buy her gifts?  does he talk to her still? I couldn't stop the train of thoughts running wild in my imagination.  I just wanted to go under the water and never come back up but, then I heard her... "Mommy! watch me on the slide!" and I was back - mood swinging the other way.    Thank God for the kids.  They teach me something new about myself everyday.  Yes, they are very tiring.  Keeping up with Connor and his medications, therapy and just plain energy alone would be enough to wear out an Olympic athlete then add a precocious 3 year old and that's my life!  I suppose as long as I remain able to recover from the downward swings then all will be okay.  If it weren't for them I would have given up long ago.  Connor asked me a question the other day that really put things into perspective for me.  He said "Mom, if Daddy gets killed in Afghanistan and something happened to you, who would take care of me & Meghan?"  I honestly hadn't thought about that eventuality.  Obviously I have to deal with the possibility that each conversation with Troy could potentially be my last, however, I never considered that I might not be around for them either.  I have to make sure that I take care of myself and work on this if for no other reason than to be here for my kids if/when they need me most.

      The last few days have been devastating to me.&nbsp; You live your life trying to believe in honesty, loyalty, the general goodness of people, only to have that faith shattered over and over again.&nbsp; I tried to believe, I wanted to believe that things were good with us.&nbsp; I wanted to believe that we were starting over, making a 'go' of it.&nbsp; I wanted everything to be okay with us.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as I was to find out, that isn't the case at all.&nbsp;   Someday, somehow, I will convince myself that the lies and deceptions aren't MY fault.&nbsp; That there's nothing I could do to prevent the things that have taken place over the past 12 years to inflict such hurt on me.&nbsp; Why am I not good enough?&nbsp; Why aren't people satisfied with me?&nbsp; Those are questions I have to learn to let go of.&nbsp; They aren't going to do me any good, especially when it's something that is completely out of my control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I do know, however, that as badly as I want to leave right now, there is something inside convincing me that the devil I know is better than any that I may run to.&nbsp; Knowing me and my luck with picking mates, I would end up with the same person only in a different wrapper.&nbsp; I know Troy, he knows me.&nbsp; Most of the time we are good together - actually we are good together all of the time.&nbsp; It appears to be the times when we  aren't  together that cause the problems!&nbsp;   I stay out of fear I suppose.&nbsp; Fear that things won't be any better anywhere else -- the grass is always greener, right???&nbsp; I should stay and cultivate my own lawn.&nbsp; Cut and fertilize and let it flourish under my watchful eye.&nbsp; Well, at least I found out about these things while he is gone.&nbsp; I don't have to make any rash decisions, I don't have to figure everything out right now, on my own.&nbsp; I have a year to come to those conclusions, to work on myself and to figure out why I allow him to do these things to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I really do hope time heals, I want this to work so bad it hurts.

      At last the quiet settles in around me.  The kids have finally fallen asleep and I have my bittersweet "alone" time.  All day I look forward to being able to walk around without someone attached at my hip or yelling my name, but when this time comes, I am at my loneliest.  There is so much I could/should be doing instead of sitting at this computer, but I just don't seem to have the energy or motivation to do any of it.  I want to be able to savor my alone time to do something special - just for me - each evening... even if that's just to relax in a bubble bath or read a book, but I just can't for some reason.  I start each day with all good intentions of doing the things I should be doing, however, by the end of the day I am so worn out from fighting with Connor and depressed that I just can't bring myself to do them.    The days are filled with episode after episode of trying to referee the kids fighting, made even worse because Connor doesn't know when to draw the line between playing and annoying.  He can't seem to remember that he is 8 years older and about 80 pounds heavier than his sister and he gets upset when he gets in trouble for wrestling with her.  I'm afraid that one day, despite my warnings and reprimands, he is really going to hurt her - purposeful or not - it won't matter once she's hurt.  I have already written two letters to Troy.  It helps me get all the thoughts out of my head before I go to sleep at night - kind of like this does.  I don't want to tell him all the bad things, I just want him to think things are going along well here and that I can handle it.  I don't want him preoccupied with anything going on here.  All that matters to me right now is doing whatever I can do to make sure he gets back home safely.  Since I can't be there personally to do that, I have to make sure that he has absolutely no distractions from the homefront.  Maybe it's just the depression flaring up a little since he's gone now, maybe things will get better as time goes by...

      We're back home from seeing Troy off.  No more goodnight phone calls or weekend trips to see him.  We will have to readjust once again to being a family of three.  I have never felt so alone or depressed.  As much as I like to complain about him when he's here, he has become so much a part of me that I feel incomplete now that he's gone.  I guess it really is true -  You don't know what you've got until it's gone.    So he can be a pain in the ass... so things don't always go perfectly... so he doesn't always say or do the things I wish he would say or do when I wish he would say or do them... but he loves me...  and that alone makes him a remarkable man.  I just hope he makes it back home so I can show him how much he means to me.    When he gets back a lot of things will be different.  We will make time for US.  Regular date nights, goodbye kisses even if we're just running out to Baskin Robbins, holding hands, saying "I love you" regardless of who is listening, letting go of the little imperfections and focusing more on the great love/friendship we share.  No one else knows me as well as he does, no one knows all of my little secrets and idiosyncracies as well as he does.  I don't know what I'll do if he doesn't come back home..... but I'm trying not to think about that right now.

      Okay, okay... so I finally have to admit that I didn't believe Troy's deployment was going to hit me so hard.  As the days become hours, I am beginning to realize how much a part of me he has become over the last 12 years.  I can't imagine a day going by without even being able to talk to him on the telephone.  Yeah, we've had our share of hard times (but that's the price we've paid and through it all we kept the promise that we made.. LOL for all you '80s hair band fans!!) we've always stayed connected in some way.  Even when we separated for a few months, we still talked every day, often several times a day.  I know I can handle the silly everyday tasks like errands and bill paying and all.... it's the little things, being able to reach out and hold his hand while we're watching TV, playing "Make It Stop" while we're driving in the car and threatening to "revoke your '80's card" if you don't know the name and artist of the most obvious 80's music, just being able to say "hey, guess what happened today, or what Meghan said or Connor did." I know I'll get letters and emails, but it's just not the same,not after 12 years of constant companionship.  I know I will make it through this, I have to, if for no other reason than for the kids.  I have to make Troy believe I can get through this as well, simply because I don't want him worrying about me when he has a WHOLE lot more important things to worry about (like coming home safely!!).  It's times like this that make you realize that the things that really matter in life are those things that you so often take for granted.  We made a lot of changes in our lives after 9/11 but those changes slowly faded back into our old habits.  Now I know that those changes were for the best, and I am going to do my best to make those changes stick.  There has never been a better time for me to make my family my number one priority, when I need to focus on making sure they are happy, content, safe and I need to make sure that I am too.... There's only the three of us for now and we need to hold onto each other.  This is going to be one serious reality check for someone who has NEVER spent a moment alone in her adult life... time to dive in to the REAL WORLD.

      Funny all the things we take for granted.  I spent the better part of the evening explaining what the "big deal" was about July 4th.  Connor didn't understand why I was upset over his Dad not being here to cook out with us and to watch fireworks.  I tried to explain to him that today is what being an American is all about, it's why Daddy is overseas helping to rebuild a new, better country, freed from an unfair government/leader.  It's what so many people have died for not just in the latest war but also in so many others, even things not recognized as "war."  I don't think he "got it" but I had to at least try to explain it.  If for no other reason than to hear myself and try to convince myself that Troy is gone doing something honorable, noble, necessary and right -- so that if...... well then I will know it was for the right reasons.

      What a good day.  I had an appointment with my trainer at the gym.  I begged her not to work my legs today since I could barely walk yesterday - we did upper body instead - I really felt good afterwards.  Then the kids and I went to the waterpark and met some friends there.  What a blessing that was since my friend's kids are a little older they took care of Meghan most of the day so I could just relax.  Connor actually ran into some friends from school so he was content.  We came home, made dinner and watched a movie and the biggest surprise of all was that NO ONE argued at bed time!!!    So why am I crying?  I talked to Troy tonite.  He leaves the country soon but it seems the closer the time gets, the more he's pulling away.  The less he calls/writes and the more agitated he seems when I call/write him.  Maybe it's just his own defense system kicking in... maybe it's something more... maybe I just have to stop over analyzing every little thing... maybe I DON'T know all the answers (gasp!!)  I do know that even though the daytime was good, once the kids are in bed and the house is quiet, I realize how alone I am and how much I miss him.....  has it been a year yet?

      Every cloud is supposed to have one right?  Where do you look for it?  Why do I feel like I've been robbed... I have yet to find my lining... maybe the cloud is just bigger than I thought and I haven't found my way to the edge yet...    The kids are making me crazy... I have no childcare... no one wants to watch an 11 year old with bipolar disorder who is unstable -- and I feel guilty admitting this, but I don't blame them -- there are days even I don't want to watch him.  I even have a hard time getting the grocery shopping done because he can't handle the stimulation of the store for more than a couple of minutes.  Then when he has a "meltdown" in the middle of the cereal isle I get the most hateful looks from strangers who have no idea what it's like to live in my house, to be me, to try to raise this kid.  I just want to offer them the chance to walk in my shoes for 12 hours -- see if they feel the same way in the end.  But ultimately, I'm in this alone... no one really cares, no one really even understands.  Not even work.  One of Working Mother's "Best Places for Working Moms."  HAH, what a joke!!  I wish they would interview me.  The boss doesn't understand the situation, nor does she care or is she willing to help me with a more flexibile schedule.  I would say my job is probably at great risk right now as a result of Troy's deployment and Connor's issues but what am I supposed to do?    Well, at least we've made it through another day... maybe that's the silver lining after all...

      I talked to Troy today and told him what a hard time I was having.  He and I had made a deal that I wouldn't dwell on the negative things going on and he wouldn't (actually he can't) tell me anything upsetting.  He asked me how things were going and although I said everything was okay, he didn't believe me.  He finally coerced me into telling him what a bad time I was having.  There are days, even though I know he's in Afghanistan and I try to be happy and listen, that he irritates me so badly.  Yes, he's at war, and yes, every conversation I have with him could be my last, but there are times that I just get so angry with him.  He still doesn't see the "big picture."  I should have realized by now that at 40 years old and after 13 years of marriage he is ALWAYS going to live in his own little world, where  his  priorities are the  ONLY  priorities no matter what.    It's not that I'm unwilling to compromise -- hell, I've been compromising for 13 years.  I have given in to his every whim - whether that was having him be a stay at home dad, supporting him (emotionally & financially) when he was trying to figure out what he wanted to do "when he grew up" and then sticking with him through the disappointments faced when he was unsuccessful.  Now, he's rapidly approaching 40 and although he has supposedly figured out what he wants, he still has a long way to go to achieve that.  I have urged him to return to college for AT LEAST the past 6 years, I have offered to have him work part time, or not at all, in order to accommodate his class schedule -- he has always found some excuse as to why he cannot do these things.  Today, we were back on that very subject.  When he comes home he would like to go to college - either for his paramedic certification or for nursing.  I am all for it.  However, he also wants to work full time and volunteer at the fire department.  All noble endeavors, all respectable activities...  I certainly understand wanting to contribute, but where does he plan to squeeze in his family activities?  Things are different now than they were when I first started encouraging college to him.  Connor is now involved in sports and Meghan with dance.  Not to mention the fact that he promised we would go to counseling and really start focusing and working on our marriage once he gets back.  I just wanted to know if he was already backing off of this promise.  He was very offended when I asked him this question.  He insists there will be time for us, but that school had to be his priority.    I tried to explain to him the parable about attempting to fit many different size rocks into a small glass jar.  The jar represents your life and your time on earth, each rock represents a priority in your life.  The size of the rocks are a direct indication of their importance in your life.  I tried to explain to him that there is a limited amount of space in that jar and if he fills it with all of his smaller rocks & pebbles first, then there will be no room for the two or three larger rocks.  I continued to explain that if he filled the jar with the big rocks first, then he could pour in the smaller pebbles and they would fill in all the space around them.  I think he's still trying to figure it out.  He was convinced that if he put the big rocks in first that he would have to just discard all the others...  Heaven knows, you can never ask Troy to give up anything he wants.  I suppose thats a result of being an only child to older parents... but that's another story for another time.  Anyway, I hate to think of this so early into the deployment, but if we (meaning me & Troy and our marriage) aren't the most important thing when he gets back; this reconciliation isn't going to work.  I cannot allow him to continue to think that just because I don't talk to him about the affairs everyday or just because I don't mention how badly I still hurt means that the pain has gone away.  It certainly doesn't mean that I'm just going to pretend that it didn't happen.  It just means that in order to get through each day, I have to suppress those thoughts and feelings.  In order to function and believe that I am a halfway worthy individual, I have to box it up and put it away.  I can't do anything about it while he's in Afghanistan -- but we have a LOT of cleaning to do when he gets back.

       WOW !  I went to my 20 year high school reunion this past Saturday and it was not at all what I expected.  I was very anxious about this event.  Over the last 20 years, in addition to finishing nursing school, I have been married twice, had 3 kids and gained about 50 pounds, so needless to say I was rather self conscious about showing up - especially since I was going to have to go alone!    I remember my high school years fondly, although there were never really any specifically memorable events, cumulatively it was very enjoyable.  I was not part of the "popular" crowd, was never invited to parties and none of the cute guys ever asked me out... However, I found out at the reunion that maybe my perception of things wasn't quite accurate.  Several of the guys I knew, but never associated with in school, approached me to finally "clear the air" as one of them put it.  Each of them confessed to having a crush on me at sometime during our school years.  The most surprising was one individual who I don't believe I EVER spoke to in school (after elementary school) who claimed that I was the object of his affection from 5th grade on!! He said he kept it a secret and was too intimidated to even attempt to ask me out!! How amazing is that!!  I can't believe that ANYONE would have been intimidated by me, much less a star athlete!  Another guy told me that he always considered me one of the "in" crowd and that I was too far out of his league to ask out... did they know the same me as I did back then????   Well, I certainly came away from this reunion feeling much, much better about myself than when I walked in.  While I'm older and heavier, I had so many positive comments about the way I look (someone even told me I was BEAUTIFUL!) I cannot believe how good it felt.  On the other hand, I felt rather guilty the next morning when Troy called from Afghanistan to inform me that there had been an "incident" and we lost two of the guys from our unit.  That really burst my bubble and brought the real world crashing in on me.... Oh well, I suppose there's no harm in reliving better times every now and then, especially when current times are so scary....

      I try and try to forgive and forget, to let bygones be bygones and to believe that the pain isn't as bad as it used to be.  But then something little will happen out of the blue and suddenly I realize that my depth perception is off.  To borrow a few lines from the band Saliva,     Look at me  my depth perception must be off again  because this hurts deeper than I thought it did  It has not healed with time   It just shot down my spine     I have been trying to move on, to be more positive, to think about the future instead of dwelling on the past but then the cell phone bill came today and it reopened all those newly healed wounds.  There it was in black and white all the times he called her and would then call and talk to me --  sometimes in the reverse, but almost always called us one right after the other... I don't know, was it guilt?  Sometimes I think not, I'm not so sure he felt guilty about it at all.     I feel so sick inside again.  I really thought I was doing pretty well letting it all go.  I suppose it won't go completely away until he and I can actually spend some time together and discuss everything.  I'm just afraid that he STILL won't be willing or able to tell the complete truth.  I don't know if I can believe the things he tells me -- even in counseling -- I guess that will be something else we will have to address with the counselor.  I wish I understood why I need this marriage to work so badly.  I wish I could feel comfortable with the idea that I could just up and leave him, but I can't.  I wish I understood why he needs to stray outside this marriage so much.  I'm not sure he's EVER been faithful in the past 12 years.  Sometimes I think I want to know the answer other times I figure I'm probably better off not knowing.    I'm finding out that the past 12 years have been a complete and total lie.  Troy acts like he worships the ground I walk on... then he screws around with other women and swears it doesn't mean anything...  maybe not to him, but it means the world to me.... It just reinforces the idea that I'll never be good enough.  I don't expect everyone to be perfect and I know I'm far from it, however, I thought maybe someone would be willing to love me (and only me) for who/what I am without having to seek additional comfort etc. outside the marriage... Maybe I'm asking too much.
