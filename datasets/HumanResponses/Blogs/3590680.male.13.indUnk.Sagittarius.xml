      I'll be back on runescape soon, but I still need to write my pen pal an email. I don't know much japanese, so I'm looking for a good online translator, or even better, a good Japanese-English Dictionary. I used a google search to try to find a good translator, but I couldn't find a reeally good one. The problem is that I cant read or write much kanji (the complicated symbols) and the online translators had a ton of kanji that I don't know... Stupid translators...     grrrrrrrrr... fsckin members

      Just got back from my roadtrip through civil war battlegrounds. Very fun and I learned a lot. Anyway,I'll be back on runescape soon.   ...   ...   Dang, I forgot what I was gonna say.   ...   pffffft...   Oh, yeah. I just remembered that I signed up for a pen pal in Japan. My japanese teacher (yes, I do learn japanese in my school) told our class about a pen pal thingy that she and an english teacher in japan set up. What was I thinking? I barely know any japanese that I can use in a conversation with someone else. I just got my first letter from her. Her name is Chihiro. Her english is waaaay better than my japanese is. I have only been learning japanese for 2 years, and I heard that they start learning english sooner in Japan than we start learning Japanese here. This is gonna be hard... I'll probably just find a really good Japanese-English online translator. hmmmmmmmmm...

       urlLink runevillage , for all your runescape troubles. It has guides for almost everything (not all of the rs2 guides are up) so if you are having trouble go there. I'm not going to be posting for a bit as i am going on a vacation. A road trip around civil war battlegrounds. S000000,... bye.  BTW if Rob is a nickname for Robert is BoB a nickname for Bobert? Just wondering.

      Today was a  very  good day for me. I got the first two map pieces for the dragonslayer quest. I killed a lvl 82 lesser demon ( I'm only lvl 52). Some lvl 60 something died near me and I got a rune medium helm, adamantine legs, chain, and 3k. Sold both the addy chain and legs for 8k, bringing my total amount of money up to 29k. Veeeery good day for me... I hope this happens again. I reeeally hope so.   grrrrrrrr... fsckin members...

      Neko and I were in the same room (in real life) and we were talking to godsmack. Saying the same things. At the same time. Pretty funny actually. Got him really confused. He started asking if we were the same person (how do you do that?). Really fun. We were (neko and I) talking to each other while typing to Godsmack. Okay... lets type pickle at the same time... 1... 2... 3... Pickle! Lets type Helloo kitty. ew ... 1... 2... 3... we did this a couple times. I personally would've gotten confused. That would be really wierd.   grrrrr... fsckin members...

      Went gaint killin today with Nekopirosan and godsmack693 (one of neko's friends). Godsmack said hes only been playing for a week... he's lvl 45. I've been playing for about a year and a half now (I didn't play for a bit, so about a year) and I'm only lvl 51. I guess its because I've been working on my other skills, but from lvl 3 to lvl 45 in only about a week! I wonder what his other skills are. I'll have to ask him.   grrrr... fsckin members...

      My friend from school (nekopirosan) is having trouble being a member. I am gald, because I'm still angry at all those members who have better stuff than me. I keep telling him to meet me somewhere and he ends up getting lost." Theres nothing around" "its all forest" Is the members area  that  big? Sheesh. I told hium to find a bank, deposit his stuff and die. That teleports you straight back to lumbridge. "great idea Eric" This becomes the only way he can get bact to the non-members areas. Is it really easy to get lost there or is it just him? I told him that there was a map on  urlLink Runevillage  and I hope he's looking at it (this means you Cam) because it would be easier to find where you are with an exact map of the members area.   Grrrrrr.... fsckin members...

      Today I saw a guy with the name "Aragorn69360" I bet thats how many times that name has been used. I mean, come on people, think up some original names here! My friend and i made a mutual account with the name "Enky", thats original. So if you're gonna start playin runescape use original names, not ones that have already been used 1,000's of times before.

      Met someone wierd today. Named llena45. just came up to me and told me her phone number (probably fake). proceeded to try to follow me into a locked room when she didnt have the key. I gave it to her because there was a dungeon there and she would probably get killed. I got down there and first thing a lvl 28 giant attacks her (shes lvl 20). She fights for a few seconds and then  runs away. I kill it. Repeat step about 4 times...gets kinda boring, so i stop helping her and she logs out. Strange.

      A friend of mine (Nekopirosan, he made  urlLink riceballneko ) just became a member... evil.... Extra evil because he cant give me any of his awesome members stuff. He has over double my quests, items, areas, monsters and skills. Yeah. this really sucks. I'm going to become a member eventually (hopefully as soon as i reach lvl 60), but until then...  FSCKIN MEMBERS!!!
