      Its raining here again. Rain is crazy in Virginia. It can be a blue sky above, but pouring down rain because the clouds move so fast. Its really annoying. I just get settled into the "rainy day" mode that includes sitting down and watching a movie, eating junk food, and putting off everything that needs to get done while you watch the rain come down outside thru the window. Now since its not raining I have to settle down to the "Its to hot and humid to do anything day" mode that includes sitting down and watching a movie, eating junk food, and putting off everything that needs to get done while you watch the sun beat down to the point where you can see the humidity in the air. It really drains me days like today.

      Ok, came to work today, had no clue what to write today in the ole blog. After a small conversation it came to me. Today's blog is going to be a top 5 countdown of Guy Bawling Movies. These are the movies that make me blubber like an idiot. So without any further waste of time, here is the list:  5. Cool Runnings Ok, first off, sport movies get to guys. Sport movies are the mans romance movies where we can show our soft side and not be a total dork. Now I saw this movie for the first time about 10 years ago. It was a stealth sob movie for guys. You go through it thinking its the typical Jamaican bobsled team movie. With characters named coffee, Yul Brenner and starring John Candy how could this movie be anything but laughs. This whole theory held true right to the end, and then it happened. The whole Bobsled tips over because of a mechanical failure, and the guys get out, pick up there little bobsled on their shoulders and walked to the finish line. I needed prozak for an hour after that. My sister was there, and she is like an emotional time bomb, and when she saw me well up, well she let loose like a hurricane. There we were, blubbering like idiots for an hour.  4. Armageddon Again, another stealth blubber movie. And first off, to defend myself, consider this. I was about 4 months from having my first child so the whole father thing was really weighing on my mind a lot. Ok, back to story. Anyways, most people have seen the movie, low on acting, high on special effects. Anyways, get to the part where Ben was going down the tube not to ever return to earth, and then at the last moment Bruce shoves him back and takes his place and yells "take care of Grace", his daughter, that was pretty bad. I held myself together though, little welling in the eyes, that was about it. K, now asteroid blows up at last moment, crew makes it home by the skin of their teeth, typical happy ending. Then the Asshole capt or whatever comes up to Grace and asks to shake the hand of the daughter of the bravest man he ever met. Again, well up on the inside, I mean jeez, the captain hated Graces dad the whole time and then to do this!?! But I was a man! I held it in! Thinking I had made it thru with out embarrassing myself I relaxed, and then it happened. The son of one of the guys who just found out who his dad was comes running up the tarmac and gives the guy a huge hug. I lost it. I don't remember making the loud whimper, but with everyone in the theater turning around to look at me while my wife sunk in her chair with the " I am not with this dumbass" look on her face let me know I did. Horrible moment in being a tough guy.  3. Big Fish I have never been a huge Tim Burton fan. I mean his movies are ok, and the whole way he does things so differently is cool, but it is also weird. I think the major difference I found in Big Fish and other Burton movies was the story, this one was good. It was a story about a sons and a fathers estranged relationship and how towards the end of the fathers life they tried to understand one another. Now there was the typical over the top Tim Burton type of effects, but in the context of telling this story they had their place. Unlike most of his movies the effects were not the story, but instead help tell it. In the last 5 minutes of the movie the son had a sudden and overwhelming understanding of who his father was. With the way the story was told, there were many different levels of what was real and what was exaggeration and in the end it all tied together. Put this with both the son and father finally understanding each other, I was a pot of goo on the couch.  2. Remember The Titans Sports movie, need I say more? Late 1960's Virginia and forced intragration began. Black and White boys playing football together for the first time. You knew you were gonna end up crying like a little girl before you went and saw the damn movie. The two tough guy boys, one black the other white, who hate each other in the beginning are calling each others brothers by the middle. Can things keep going this well? Hell no, this is the movies. The white player ends up getting hit by a car while driving after a game and is paralyzed from the waste down for the rest of his life. End there? Hell no, end of the movie is the guy funeral. Lives for 10 years in a wheelchair, gets gold in the special Olympics for shot put and ends up getting killed by a drunk driver. Maybe the guy should have took a hint and stayed away from cars entirely. With the fact that this movie was based on a true story, and you could tell because no one could ever make up such a good story, I was a bowl of emotional Jello on my couch at the end probably crapping on myself and not caring. It was horrible, what a great movie!  1. Where The Red Fern Grows I cannot watch this movie with anyone in the room. This is my only way that I can protect any sort of manhood self-esteem. I read this book countless times as a child, erupting in tears at the end every time. For those of you not in the know, the story is about a boy and his two hunting dogs, Big Dan and Little Anne. Think Old Yeller in the Ozarks. The movie is pretty old, I think made back in the late seventies. Honest to god there is part of me that is ready to cry right now as I write this thinking about that damn movie. I don't know what it is about a movie with dogs and kids that end up in tragedy that people seem to feel driven to watch, but this is one of em. If I watch this movie I seriously need therapy for a month.  That's it. I guess I just felt the need to let the world know what a blubbering idiot I can be. More to come soon.......

      &nbsp;Ok, so I walk in the front door from work. Baby girl is having a bad day screaming, middle child runs up to me naked and starts head butting me stomach and oldest boy is showing me attitude cuz we butted heads the night before.&nbsp;   Within one minute middle and oldest boy are at each others throats, im talking full on WWF stuff going on in the middle of my living room, and baby girl is now having a prozak moment breakdown.&nbsp;   Thirty seconds later oldest child is now at moms feet screaming I need a cheese and mayonnaise sandwich along with Corndogs. &nbsp; Mom takes screaming baby girl and whips her up on they hip (you can always tell moms cuz one hip sticks out further than another, that happens because that is where the baby spent 74% of their first year of life.&nbsp;   The food appears 2 minutes later.&nbsp;   Middle son is now dressed again apparently for the third time today and French toast sticks keep him nice an quiet for first time today.&nbsp;   Baby girl is now happy as a clam&nbsp;because she got to sit on moms hip&nbsp;as mom brings me 4 hot freshly made tacos for dinner.   My wife has just done more work and put up with more grief&nbsp;in 10 minutes than I do in the entire day.&nbsp;   Amazing.

      Ok, well I was trying to figure out how to start up this thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; And since I am at work it took care of itself, annoying customer called.&nbsp; You will hear about annoying customer a lot from me in these post since they take up 40% of my time and 100% of my patcience every day.&nbsp;   Before this rant starts, here is a little insite:  I work at an ISP (Internet Service Provider).&nbsp; Please take note of that second word in there "Service".&nbsp; We are a service not unlike your cable company or even a car mechanic.&nbsp; When you first think of it, it sounds pretty simple huh?&nbsp; Oh how looks can be deceiving.&nbsp; Here is an example of what just happened.   Me:Good afternoon, Blah Blah Blah, How can I help you?&nbsp;   * Blah is company name *&nbsp;    * Side note * &nbsp; I have the gayest customer service voice ever.&nbsp; When I answer the phone I really sound like a flamer and its more attune to "Blah Blah Blah, would you like to&nbsp;put it in my mouth?"  Anyways, so I answer the call and I get "My computer wont start, what's wrong with you guys!?!".   Now we will do a little exercise called what actually happened, and what should have happened, what actually happened is in italics and what should have happened in bold.  Customer:&nbsp; My computer wont start, what's wrong with you guys!?!&nbsp;   Well sir, I don't think were having any problems here, let me check.    You frickin moron.&nbsp;    A. If anything was wrong here it could not possibly cause your computer not to turn on.    B.&nbsp; If you give me any more attitude I will make sure to read all your email and forward the good stuff to your wife and boss.    No sir, no problems&nbsp;here.&nbsp; You do know were your internet provider, and&nbsp;your computer not starting&nbsp;really has&nbsp;nothing to do with our service.    Dumbass.   Customer:&nbsp; Well everything was fine yesterday, and now it wont start, what's wrong with you guys!?!   Well, there were those really bad thunderstorms with lightning that happened yesterday, did you unplug your computer while it was not in use during the storms?    You are a dumbass.&nbsp; This is not my problem.&nbsp; I am your ISP, this has nothing to do with your computer not turning on.&nbsp; If your damn TV doesn't turn on, do you call your cable company or a television repairman.&nbsp; Obviously your cheap ass would call the cable company because you don't want to fork out the cash it will take to fix your problem.   *Side Note* Justin, my co-worker just came up and rubbed my nipples, I work with the gays!  *Another Side Note*&nbsp; I belive computer people have become the mechanics of the 60's.&nbsp; Back in the 60's cars were just really starting to become something everyone had, and if there was a problem people had the concept of they paid for the car, they should not have to spend any more money on it, so they will expect someone who knows someone to work on their car for free just because they know now, and its like a hobby for them.&nbsp; People are eat up with the dumbass.  Customer: Well, your my provider, so I am calling you.   Well sir, is your computer under any type of warranty?    See above sidenote cheapo.   Customer: Well I dont know.   Who manufactured the computer?    So what your really saying is, you got it at a yardsale for 10 bucks, and you dont have a clue in the world why it wont start.   Customer: I dont know who made it, how do I tell?   Is there a sticker in the front?    You dont deserve to have a computer dummy.   Customer:&nbsp; Im not sure, its running Windows 95.   Well sir, that means its probably out of warranty.&nbsp; You may need to take it to a computer shop and have it looked at.    Duh.   Customer: Well, how much is that going to cost?   Since we dont work on computers I am not sure, but normally around 60 dollars the first hour + parts    Why do you even bother asking?   Customer: Well that more than I paid for the dang thing!&nbsp; Just cancel my account!   Ok sir, we can do that, could you please send in a written request to cancel the account?&nbsp; Oh, and It looks like your 2 months behind.&nbsp; You just started with us 60 days ago and havent sent in a payment, did you get the bills?    How cheap you are shocks my very soul.   Customer:&nbsp; Well its not my fault my computer doesent work now, you expect me to pay for something I cant use?!?   No sir, but the past due amount is from the time you used it.    Fricken Deadbeat   Customer:&nbsp; Well, you guys suck!&nbsp; Im gonna make sure to tell everyone how bad your service is, and you can take me to court if you want to get the money! CLICK   Thank you for calling Blah Blah Blah    Asshole     &nbsp;  There you go, just one little bit of my day for ya.&nbsp; Man, this is kinda theraputic.&nbsp; Im gonna havta add more to this blog all the time!&nbsp; Anyways, I guess when I have more time and nothing to write about I will put down a little about myself, but until then, its rant time!   &nbsp;

      This is just a filler post so the millions and millions of my fans will not be let down by not seeing a new post today. Actually, gonna take a few minutes to point a few things out about my previous and forthcoming posts. I whine a lot. I was shocked to see how much I bitched in my previous posts. Here is a little insider info so you can take everything with the grain of salt it is meant to be served with. My 3 kids are awesome. They are smart, crack me up all the time and are very well behaved. My wife as I already have said is awesome and I am the luckiest guy I know because she sticks with me. My work is incredible. My co-workers are my friends and there is non of that stupid backstabbing crap going on that happens in other work places. My boss is a fairly good mentor, I only say fairly good because he will read this and get a big head. He gives us all direction and then leaves it up to us to get to the end, and its worked so far. I work in a game room for the love of god. The internet business has over 2000 customers, 99.9% of which are great people that I never hear anything but praise from. One even knit my firstborn his receiving blanket, and I did not even ask! So when you read my posts and are getting a story in your head, please remind yourself that there was a good chance I was writing the blog from work, and laughing my ass off with my co-workers/friends as I did it. Peace out G, RockFisch.

I have 2 full time co-workers, and a few part timers, so their is alot of things being thrown around. Without further adu, the quotes.   Potty Humor  *In our office above the bathroom door we have installed a flashing red light that comes on when people are in the bathroom. This saves us embarrasing moments trying to break in on someone and also serves as a warning system of the foul oders that may be eminating from the room. Here are some quotes from people as they exit this area.  Justin: Wow, that had some legs on it!  Mike: Dag, that was some work Evan: Did you turn on the fan? Mike: Theres a fan?

Mike and Justin: Giggle like little girls  Justin: What crawled up you and died? Mike: My pet gerbal, her name was Samantha.  Mike:  That was cool.  You could actually see it ramp up from small intestine to large intestine by the size.   Game Room Slop * As I said, we have a game room in our offices, so we get to hear all sorts of interesting conversations*  Customer: The game cheated! It hates me! It knows I am sitting here, who I am and it cheats against me! Evan: Suck it up whiner.  Customer 1: I really like this swedish death metal band. Customer 2: Yeah there really cool, but their songs are gay. Customer 1: So you say their cool, but their songs are gay. Are you coming out of the closet?? Customer 2: I don't know, maybe. Is that bad?  Customer: So how much is it the first hour? Justin: $5.00 Customer: You know you would get alot more people in here if it was free. Justin: Yes, but then we would not make any money. Customer: Yeah, but alot more people would be here.   Tech Support Hotline  *This is where some of the best quotes come from* Customer: I am having a problem connecting to you guys.

      So here it is, another start of another week. Its Monday, god we all hate Mondays. Oh, its still raining, VH1 still exists (I bet you 10 to 1 odds there playing some sort of "I love the XX"s and doesn't it make your ass feel old tonight), I have to come into work for the first day and get this, the air conditioning pan got plugged up,and water came down a wall into our floors. Yea! We get to steam clean the carpets. Its payday, which in once sense is good because you get to be not broke for a week, but its bad when your on of the owners of the business cuz now your business is broke for a week. Funny how that works. So here it goes, the beginning of the dreaded work week. Suddenly it happens.  Starts out with one of your partners takes you out to lunch. Good food, good conversation. Then it leads to another one of your partners comes in and tells you he has gotten the contract deal you wanted. Now the company will make 30K more from just one client, and will prob be closer to 40K when all is said and done. This also opened up new business avenues that we are going to look at pursuing. Then in another business front, our game room is getting an article written up this week in a local newspaper. Not only is that going to help up with business, but it may possibly lead to more business. By this I mean that a town close to us is going thru some major changes, the thruway is going from 2 to 4 lanes on the main strip. They are having to knock buildings down and put up new ones. This is a pretty small town so many of the locally owned businesses are using this as a good way to shut down their storefront, and get a little kickback from the state. Since this is happening the state is now giving out grants for small businesses to start up in the area, and the newpaper has told us they would love to have a business like ours in their town. This may be a very easy way for us to expand our business with hardly any money risk!  You know, rainy Mondays kinda kick ass! I need to have more of them. Guess it just goes to show you, you never know what kind of day it is gonna be until you get your ass out of bed and see for yourself. Keep pluggin folks, it only gets better!  Post Script: I had Evan just look up what on tonight at VH1, I love the 70's. F'n morons.

      Im sitting here, waiting for the work week to start which is what I inevitably end up doing every Sunday. Sunday really is a bummer day. Its the day that your supposed to be enjoying the downside of the weekend before you get going on Monday. With me it works out with a pang of resentment the moment I wake up. The first thing that flashes thru my mind is that at this time tomorrow I will already be at work, and have 4 more days that I have to do the same. The rest of the day is just that thought over and over with everything I do. Anyways, so im sitting here watching VH1. I Love the 80's come on. Then it hits me. I Love the 80's are the Ktel alblum of the new millennium. When I was growning up all the so called hits of the 70's came out on Ktel albums that you could buy on tv or your local Pennywise. Now im watching this show, and im all going "wow, that is like the greatest TV show ever!" and "Dag, I loved that song!". SHIT! Im old! How the hell did that happen??? For the love of god they already have the I Love the 90's! That is like yesterday! This is such bull! I mean just because I liked Webster, does this mean im past my middle age??? Man, life just goes by to fast. I can still remember going around the block on my tricycle with my friend Kevin, how could this happen to me. And who is making all the money off of my depression!?! Oh god, there went the Rubiks Cube, I loved that thing! Hammer, my god MC Hammer is alive! Did you know I could break dance? I had a mean worm thru the arm thingy going. Man, that was so long ago, or was it? Wow, the Money For Nothing video was soooo huge. I bet half the people who read this do not even clue in to what I am talking about. Ok, im pissed now. I am gonna get out of here go be old in another room where I dont have to be reminded exactly how old I am. I HATE VH1
