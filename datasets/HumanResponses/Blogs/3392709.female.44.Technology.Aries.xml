      In 1987, if you charged a cop for a cup of coffee, they all looked at you like you were the kind of person who ran kittens over in your driveway for fun. A cop, in uniform, while not your best tipper (afraid to be viewed as too appreciative) was never too proud to accept a cup of coffee and a doughnut for a buck. Once, I wondered aloud what the hell this particular dollar-a-day cop had ever actually done for us to deserve free coffee and doughnuts daily. “They hang out in the lot.” I was told by a man who came from a country where justice was bought and sold. “They come when you need them.” Okay, sorry- I thought that was the idea here in America. What do I know; I’m just a waitress. “Exactly”, he says. In 1989, the Sherwood Diner on Rockaway Turnpike in Lawrence, a big believer in coffee and eggs in exchange for speedy response from the Sixth Precinct of the Nassau County Police Department, was held up on a Wednesday morning at 1 AM. The night manager, a very nice Greek man named Tommy, and the counter man, a nasty little guy named Carlos were doing what you do at 1AM on a Tuesday night/Wednesday morning in a diner. Cleaning, stocking, chatting, when a guy with a nylon stocking pulled over his head (Carlos noted later that the stocking had a run in it, leading to the speculation that it was an inside job-masterminded by a cook and a waitress), and a pistol came through the front of the diner, herded both Carlos and Tommy through the brightly-lit diner, into the kitchen, locked them in the walk-in refrigerator and wiped out the day and night receipts. Now, here’s the thing. The back parking lot of the Sherwood Diner shared space with Falcaro’s Bowling Alley, which is hopping every night of the week. It was a favorite hangout for the Sixth Precinct, since they could watch both the diner and the bowling alley (Both hotbeds of criminal activity within the Five Towns area) and have ready access to bathrooms, coffee and fries. However, on this particular Wednesday morning, as the Sherwood Diner was robbed, there was not a spot of blue in sight. The front parking lot of the Sherwood Diner faces Rockaway Turnpike, not far from Peninsula Boulevard, probably one of the busiest intersections in Nassau County. Every single regular cop I asked was off that Tuesday night. That was then. This morning on my way to work, I stopped at a Bagel place on Hicksville Road in Massapequa. Your average homeowner in Massapequa pays around 7000.00 a year in taxes, part of which, I understand goes to pay the salaries of the Seventh Precinct of Nassau County Police Department. I believe the starting salary for a Nassau County police officer is around 40,000.00 and the average salary probably around 80,000.00. While standing in the Bagel store waiting for my order, I was alerted to the presence of a Police officer by the sound of his radio blasting loudly through the store. Now, throughout my career as a diner waitress, I have recovered (to the great appreciation of Nassau’s finest) many a radio left on the Breakfast booth in the rush to go home. I have always been under the impression that the proper etiquette for an officer receiving a meal is NOT to draw attention to themselves, rather, to lower the radio, remove the badge and try and be as discreet as possible when receiving a breakfast on the cuff. Apparently, the same protocol does not apply to our Seventh Precinct. The young man ordered two extra-large coffees (light and sweet), and took them, without blinking an eye, back to the patrol car without so much as a “Have a good one.” Now come on. Bagel shops usually hire for ten hour shifts. 5AM till 3PM. The girls usually top out at around five bucks an hour off the books and work five days a week. Do the math. In 1987, a cop wouldn’t have dreamed of accepting his free coffee and doughnut without at least a dollar tip for the waitress.      The Massapequa Diner on Sunrise Highway in Massapequa has a half-price policy for our hard-working, poverty-stricken Nassau County Police Force. Every night, usually in the middle of a busy dinner shift, the Seventh Precinct will call in their dinner order. Nothing too fancy, London Broil sandwiches, Burgers, a couple grilled chicken plates. Maybe a hundred bucks. A 20-something rookie is usually chosen to go and pick up the dinner order. He swaggers up to the counter,”7th”, he half-whispers like a secret-not too loud, lets just get the food and get out. I drag the box out, go over the order, write an unlisted check for Fifty bucks (no tax), and this guy looks me dead in the eye and says, “Thanks” and walks away. The cashier (who knows the deal) rings him up and says “OK, that’s fifty even- you took care of the girl, right?” His face turns three shades of red and he drags himself back and hands me a five. Ten percent.      In order to become a member of the Nassau County Police Department, one must possess a degree in Criminology, or at least Criminal Justice, I think. I know you have to have some college, be a citizen of the United States, and have a driver’s license. One would hope that the force which guards our 500,000 dollar homes and 30,000 dollar cars would at least be intelligent enough and familiar enough with the customs of the United States to know that the TIP IS NOT INCLUDED.      I thank him loudly, loudly enough to embarrass him, and from that point on, I charge that particular for every single cup of coffee he ever orders.      In 1992, The Massapequa Diner receives a phone call. A man, speaking Greek, informs the manager, a strange man named Gus who once served in the Greek Navy, that a bomb has been placed in the kitchen of the Diner. Emergency steps are taken, 911 is called, and we evacuate the premises, tactfully. Nine people are asked to leave without finishing their meals, being told that there is a grease fire in the back, and they go without paying, a fact which is not overlooked in the retelling the next day. We all assemble in the empty lot next door and wait twenty-five minutes for the Seventh Precinct to respond with one car. The officer and the manager walk around inside, declare the place clean, and expect us to return to work.      I decline. Check, please.
