      If you are the one who believes that the setback suffered by parties in the recent elections indicate the public's vote against economic reforms, you are not alone. The Indian media has done a tremendous job of portraying that the recent electoral setbacks suffered by BJP nationally, TDP in AP and Congress in Karnataka as clear indication of how the general public is against economic reforms. I think, the results on the other hand, convey a contrary view. Here is why...  The 2004 election results, according to me, clearly indicate that the common man (read farmers) wants more reforms, not less. He is not satisfied just to see his urban counterpart grow richer and richer while he languishes in his parched fields. He wants similar reforms that will directly affect him. He wants reforms that pave way for better irrigation systems, he wants reforms that create better infrastructure to store and transport what he produces and he wants reforms to improve his now battered life style. I can't think of anyone opposing reforms if he is convinced that reforms are going to change his life for the better. Simply put, this is what the common man wants the pro reformers to answer:  "I see that reforms have improved the overall quality of life of the urban populace. Why can't you do something similar to improve my life? Why did you neglect me? Am I not entitled to enjoy the fruits of reforms?"  Now, given this current situation, can we structure reforms so that everyone is benefited? I can now visualize you saying: "They have to be patient. Slowly the reforms we have initiated in the past decade will eventually benefit the poor". Is that the only option available to all poor countries that want to embrace reforms? I think not.   If steps had been taken to improve the irrigation facilities, to create a mini green revolution in parched areas, to solve the endless day to day miseries of farmers, the results would have been completely different. India would truly be shining. Is it that difficult to think of innovative ideas and mobilize funds for reforming the farm sector? Definitely not. If the same people can think of ways to fund the "Golden Quadrilateral" project, the hundred thousand crore port sector project, why not the farm sector? I firmly believe it is possible to do both: Reform Industry and farm sector at the same time. We should have pursued the GQ and port sector projects but at the same time a similar project should have been initiated for the farm sector. That is where BJP and TDP failed. Will Congress learn from the previous governments mistakes? Let’s hope so.  A peek in to next week's article:  I have talked endlessly on why the farm sector should be reformed. My next article is on how exactly the new government can do it.  See you then. Ram.

      Here I am, on a very warm and wet Sunday evening in Richmond, reading that Sonia will become the next PM of India. In the past few days, I had the opportunity to listen to many of my friend's comments on the recently concluded elections in India. Here are some of my own..   On BJP's defeat:  According to me, 3 factors contributed to the defeat.   1. Poll arithmetic - If they had stayed with the DMK, they would have got 40 more seats! 2. Middle class voters - If the eligible voters of the so called middle class, who largely benefited from BJP's policies had come out of their houses and voted, then the results would have been completely different. 3. Policies - I am all for development. I will not criticize what they did for the country by way of reforms. It’s what they didn't do that matters. The whole of India needs reforms, not just Indian cities. More on this on "lessons to be learned"   Is the verdict good for India in the long run..?:  I sincerely hope so. Congress has got some able hands that can steer the country forward. Are they going to do a better job than their counterparts in BJP? Not in all areas but definitely in finance/commerce/industry ministries (if the communists don't keep poking their nose). Also, i think there will be a more balanced approach to reforms now that we have seen what can happen if they are focused on only one strata of the society.   Lessons to be learned for aspiring politicians:  You can do what you want to do for the country only if you are in power. You don't want to waste five long years waiting for the next opportunity to turn your dreams for India in to reality. To be in power, you have to satisfy the rural poor. You cannot wish them way and in fact, should not. They are the ones who come out to vote and reforms should cater to their needs too. "Why would I care if Bill Gates visited my state capital, when I don't have anything to eat or drink?"   On Sonia becoming PM:  Initially I was rather disappointed. But when i think about it more, it doesn't seem so bad. Yes, she is not a "true" Indian but the people in India have voted for her knowing fully well that if they vote for Congress (or its alliance partners), they are implicitly voting for Sonia. I can't disagree more with Uma Bharathi claiming that the people did not vote for Sonia because she wasn't projected as the PM. Well it’s true that she wasn't projected but even the most illiterate of voters knew that she'll become PM if Congress comes to power. After all she has done all the hard work, so why shouldn't she enjoy the fruits of her labor?   Final note:   Let’s hope that Sonia brings a fresh air to Indian politics and weeds out corruption (I’m not sure how this'll happen with seasoned congress politicians as ministers!). Let’s also hope that the reforms are continued to the benefit of everyone.   As always, your comments are most welcome  Ram.

      Thanks to Banu, I created this blog to post my views (and yours) on any issue that affects India. The posts will cover a wide spectrum of issues showing my lack of in depth knowledge in any one particular field. I have always considered myself (as) "Jack of all trades and master of none" and this is going to be no different!  To make this blog successful, i invite you all to use this as a discussion forum. Flood the blog with your comments and we will all gain by sharing views on issues that affect India. Discussions will almost always lead to innovative solutions to even the most mundane problems.   Welcome to the new India - An India that will take its rightful place among the world’s greatest nations.  Ram.

      I am currently going through my mid year performance check in my company. It’s a fairly short process and gives a rough idea of where you stand and what is expected of you. Why don't we have a similar review for government employees in India?  I know for sure that this topic would have been discussed by the people in power at some point of time but I don't think I heard anything about this recently (my recently is at least 10 years!). If I am wrong or plain ignorant, correct me.  Since the new government has decided not to sell profit making PSU's, it can at least make sure that things are done efficiently by implementing a simple performance management process. If promotions are strictly based on performance, employee morale will rise and so will productivity. Hopefully labor unions and left parties will not raise a hue and cry about this.  Just to give you an example of how bad PSU's are... I went for a couple of days training to ICF (Integral Coach Factory, Chennai) some 4 - 5 years back. In an 8 hour shift, most employees will work in a frenetic pace for 3 - 4 hours and take the rest of the day off (I have to admit that there were employees who stayed for the entire shift length). This, in a supposedly efficient organization like ICF. I do not know how it is now but performance management will help for sure.  Ram.

      With the Olympics not far off, I think this is a good time to write about the precarious state of sports in India. This is definitely not the first one on this subject. Neither is it going to be the last. I know you are now saying “I have read so many articles on the subject, what’s new?” I can assure you that there is going to be nothing new but instead of talking about why (most of the articles focus on this part. There is a good article on BBC by Rohit Brijnath), I am going to talk about how  India doesn't lack infrastructure. We have huge stadiums in almost all cities and towns. What we lack are people - people who want to have sports as their career. Some writers have blamed it on culture, some on government and some even on our physical capabilities (or a lack of it). Though all those might be true to a certain extent, I think the main hindrance is MONEY. After all, that’s what most people strive for... Money to have a good life for themselves and their family.  If some how we can make sports financially attractive to young kids and their parents, then we'll see a lot more medals for India in International events. We have to make this happen. But how?  There might be a couple of solutions but the item on top of my list is marketing. If you go to a professional game in US, the stadium is invariably packed to capacity and then there are television rights. What do all these add up to? Big money. Players are paid like crazy and most of the owners are profitable (even after doling out huge pay checks). That brings us to the point of why this is not happening in India (other than international cricket matches)?   We have to first understand that any sport is business and should be treated as such. Only if it’s profitable for everybody involved, will it survive. Instead of the government trying to offer jobs for sports persons at meager salaries, it should take initiatives to attract private parties to invest in athletes. I now it is easier said than done but we have ample examples to follow (Soccer in Europe, NBA, NFL in US, International Cricket in India and others)  Let’s commercialize sports and not just say passionate sport persons will succeed against all odds. If pushed to the limit, passion will die down. Don't fault the athlete - Everybody needs money, passionate or not. As long as we don’t bring money in to sports, we’ll see an ever-growing number of doctors and engineers but not one world renowned Indian athlete.  Ram.

      We all know that it will be good for Indian democracy if the common man can play a pro active role in politics other than just vote every five years. But due to the electoral system, once we give a mandate for a particular party to govern us, we can only sit and watch whatever they do for five years. The reality is, common man, how much ever he thinks he is empowered, can't do much to change the policies let alone play a pro active role in shaping them. This is where the Indian media can come in on his behalf.   What the media can/should do: Prepare a performance report every month for each elected candidate and the overall government    The bane of Indian democracy is that parties promise so much when campaigning but fail to deliver on those promises once they get elected. So if a newspaper like 'The Hindu' prints a two page performance report every month on what the representative promised and what has he/she done in the past month to  deliver on those promises, it would not only keep the representatives on their toes but also improve circulation for the paper (which is necessary from the papers’ perspective).  The newspaper doesn't have to antagonize anybody doing this. It can interview each representative on what they are planning to do for their constituencies at the start of the term and keep tab on what they do to accomplish those. The way I envision this is the paper should have the performance report (what was promised and what has been accomplished till date) of the entire government and depending on the edition, the performance report of local candidates.  The above plan, in my opinion, will increase public awareness and also will help representatives to know how they are faring compared to their colleagues. I sincerely hope that if this is implemented, it will help people make educated choices at least in the next elections rather than just vote based on party symbol or persons long dead.

      It’s been a long time since the last green revolution made India self reliant in agriculture. With drought affecting almost all states for the past 3 years, the country is badly in need of one more revolution... But this time around, the focus should be more on farming methods than on finding high yielding crops.   Major Problems Facing Indian Agriculture:  1. Severe drought/highly depleted ground water especially in the southern states 2. Highly fragmented lands 3. Transportation/Storage Infrastructure  Though the government can't do much about the rains, it is high time it spends money and energy in reforming the farm sector that can sustain itself even if the rain gods fail us. A recent article in BW Online claims that China, with 60% of India's cultivable land area produces 40% more! So, what is it that they do differently? How can we tackle the above mentioned problems?   Handling Drought:  Most of the south Indian rivers are seasonal. They get water during south west monsoon in June/July and otherwise remain almost dry through the rest of the year. If the monsoon fails, the focus simply shifts to depleting the already depleted ground water. There are number of dams across Cauvery, Krishna and other rivers. So constructing more dams is not a solution. The best way would be to cultivate crops that are not too dependent on water. I know it is difficult to convince a farmer who has cultivated paddy all his life to change but there is no alternative. Another way would be to adopt drip irrigation en masse. Studies have shown that drip irrigation saves 30 - 50% more water than conventional methods. The only obstacle is the prohibitive fixed cost. But state governments can spend money on such long term solutions instead of building more and more canals from dry rivers.   Fragmented Lands/Farming Methods:  Fragmented landscape is without doubt a major hindrance if we plan to use high technology equipments. People who hold adjacent parcels of land should be encouraged to come together and use the available resources better. Coming from a farming background, I have seen firsthand the problems of different people owning adjacent pieces of land. For really small farmers, the cooperative route might work much better.   Infrastructure:  With a substantial amount of farm produce going waste every year, there is immense scope for creating proper storage and transportation facilities. Private sector should be involved to facilitate rapid construction of such facilities. It has been estimated that if all the farm produce can see the light of the market, then India should have enough to satisfy the needs of its people. Just 3 years ago, farmers in Punjab and Haryana were forced to burn wheat because it cost them more to store it while farmers down south and east were starving. The new government should have policies in place that makes construction of proper storage facilities a good investment for MNC's as well as Indian organizations.  Other areas that the government should take initiative include: Waste land development (why not give huge tracts of waste land to Monsanto/DuPont to develop and make sure that peasants are employed?), educating farmers in best farming techniques, research on less water dependent rice/wheat varieties, etc.  I sincerely hope that if the government can get the private sector involved in agriculture, our droughts will be less severe and more importantly, the suicide rate among farmers will come down.  Ram.

        This is a sad story of a person who had immense political power and used all that power to do everything for herself (and her near and dear ones) and almost nothing for the state of Tamil Nadu.   Jayalalitha Jayaram is intelligent, shrewd and a good communicator (at least when prepared). Alas, she is also self centered, arrogant and extremely fickle. She could have been the Mahatir Mohammed or Lee Kuan Yew of Tamil Nadu. She chose to be another typical Indian politician. That’s what saddens me.  Jayalalitha had the ability and political power to do whatever she wanted after her ascendancy to the throne in 1991. The 'Queen' literally had the whole of Tamil Nadu bureaucracy marching to her beats. Yet, she didn't positively influence anything. She could have reformed the entire bureaucracy and made it work for the people. She could have reformed education, brought in rapid industrialization and most importantly improved the quality of life for people who voted for her. In most cases, she did the exact opposite. Corruption was rampant, industrial growth stagnated and the common man was subject to untold sufferings (Denizens of Santhome and Foreshore Estate during her foster son's marriage will attest to this).  Thank god we have elections in India every five years. She was promptly punished in the hustings in 1996. It has been written in various magazines and newspapers that she has considerably mellowed down since then.  Yet as recently as two months back, we found out how fickle she was. She undid all the good work of the first three years of her second term in one day after the Lok sabha defeat. She has two more years to go. Will she realize the opportunity she has now or may have in the future to be the 'Architect of modern Tamil Nadu'? Only time will tell.  Till next time Ram.

        It’s a foregone conclusion that caste plays an important role in Indian politics and will continue to&nbsp;do so&nbsp;in the future. Given that it is really going to do more harm than good for Indian democracy and given that it has&nbsp;not brought out any significant improvement for any particular caste,&nbsp;why the heck does caste play such an important role in deciding the fate of most candidates?  &nbsp;  We have to go back in time to understand this. For too long, the so called upper castes dominated the political scene and in turn the lower caste people.&nbsp; So when Periyar showed the lower caste people that they are also equal in all respects and can play an active role in shaping modern India, they grabbed the opportunity&nbsp;with both hands.&nbsp; Nothing wrong (in fact I am happy that they did), but the fact remains that from then on, it has been a game of one-upmanship.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the game seems to be going on for ever and it doesn't look like it's going to get over any soon.  &nbsp;  We, as citizens, should&nbsp;shoulder most of&nbsp;the blame for&nbsp;letting opportunistic politicians use us as pawns in the caste game.&nbsp;Educated or not, wealthy or not, powerful or not,&nbsp;most&nbsp;Indians vote based on caste. Want proof? See how parties choose candidates. It’s a well documented fact that&nbsp;parties nominate a person from the dominant community in a constituency (of course, there are exceptions). Why would they do that? Simple. Indians (at least politicians) learnt their lessons rather well from the British; Divide and Rule. They want to win and knowing people will be swayed by emotions, they harp on caste and history come election time  &nbsp;  Now comes the most challenging part. Having understood the underlying reasons for why caste and politics got so mixed up, can we change the aforementioned scenario? We all understand that we need to, but is there a practical solution? In most of my posts, I have at least tried to give a workable solution but this is beyond me, at least for now.  &nbsp;  Do you think there is anyway we can uncouple caste and politics? If so, I invite you to post your comments. Who knows,&nbsp;some day&nbsp;it might&nbsp;help India&nbsp;become a&nbsp;true democracy.  &nbsp;  Ram.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      At long last, more than 13 years after economic reforms were initiated; an Indian PM admitted that the most basic reforms that people in India need are GOVERNMENTAL REFORMS. This announcement is as huge as his first budget speech back in 1991. (Is it just coincidence that both the major speeches were by the same person?)  Economic reforms are needed. No questions. But to sustain high growth and to make sure that all sections of the populace are benefited, what India needs is the total transformation of how the government and its employees work. Allow me to illustrate this by an analogy.  Lets say Y represents the Indian economy and X, the Indian government. Consider for a moment that both are machines in a manufacturing plant and for now let’s assume that those are the only machines in the plant.                                      X --> Y  As can be deduced from the above equation, Y is totally dependent on X. That is, if the capacity of X is 12 products per minute and Y is 10 products per minute and all of the products that pass through X, has to pass through Y to be considered marketable, then the overall capacity of the plant is 10 products per minute.  This is what happened in India in the past decade: X was functioning well below capacity at 5 products/min and Y was still poorer at 3 products/min. After 1991, we realized we have to improve Y and so we tried and succeeded in bringing it to 5 products/min and everyone was happy. Sadly that’s not the end, just the beginning…  What we must understand is that, we cannot go on improving Y without improving X. As was mentioned earlier, X represents the government and Y the economy. Hence to improve the Indian economy further, we need reforms that transform how the government works. If we can do that, we can consistently achieve what every country dreams of: 10% growth every year!  Inspiration for this article: The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt  Ram.

       Two unrelated incidents this Friday made me wonder about the meaning of the word 'Democracy'. In India, we are proud to call ourselves the world’s largest democracy. Are we one?  I have wanted to see 'Fahrenheit 9/11' since its release and I finally managed to overcome my laziness (the film is not being screened in a nearby multiplex) this Friday. Coming from India and Tamil Nadu in particular, where a member of the media can go to jail if you write or say anything against the ruling party, it truly amazed me that a documentary so critical of the incumbent president is allowed to be screened wherever the director wants! That says something about democracy!  The same day, I read a news article in BBC noting that the Indian censor board has decided to ban 'Right Solutions', a documentary about the Gujarat communal riots that killed close to 1000 people. Reason for the ban? It may flare up communal tensions again. That again says something about democracy!  The censor board might be right. But aren't we denying millions of people the right to know what actually happened in Gujarat? You might say you know everything that went on during those gruesome days. But do you? I thought (and so did most people) that the media did a great job of covering 9/11. That was until I saw Michael Moores’ film. I am sure people will feel the same way after seeing Right Solutions.  We as citizens have the right to information. It is us who should decide whether what is shown is right or wrong. It is us who should decide whether to change our opinions based on what is shown. That’s what happens in a democracy. Are we one?  Ram.        (PS: I am sure we cannot judge whether India is a democracy by the example stated above. It's too superficial for that! The example should ideally get you started thinking more about this subject.)

       Today, 167 countries across the globe took a small but important step together towards removing barriers for trade. Though the specifics are yet to be worked out (which will probably happen in the next round in Hong Kong), an overall compromise was agreed upon by developed and developing nations in what should be considered a successful Geneva conference. Supachai Panitchpakdi, Director General (WTO) calls it a 'minor triumph', rightly so, with still a lot left to be accomplished before 2007*.  After two rounds of hostile and inconclusive trade talks at Doha and Cancun, a broad consensus was arrived at,  1. To reduce subsidies given by developed nations to their framers 2. To open up the economies of developing nations to manufactured goods and services and 3. To continue trade barriers for special products (that are crucial to a country's economy)  Farm subsidies allowed framers in US and EU to dump low cost farm products on developing and under developed nations causing havoc to their already fragile economies. Case in point is the subsidies given to US farmers that allowed them to produce low cost cotton. Traditional cotton producing states in Africa were severely affected by this and naturally opposed opening up their economies to US goods and services. So a break through of sorts was finally achieved today with the developed nations agreeing to cut farm subsidies and developing nations in turn agreeing to open up their economies more.  Assuming that this agreement will be taken forward by member nations as promised, lets see what effect it'll have on the Indian economy. We have been lobbying hard for reduction in farm subsidies all along and the agreement reached in Geneva should benefit Indian farmers. Over all, the developed nations had an unfair advantage due to farm subsidies and it had to go. This will create a level playing field and once our farmers give up on their archaic methods of farming, we should be able to compete in the world market (rain god willing, of course!)  It's a bit trickier to gauge the benefit of opening up the economies of developing nations to manufacturing goods and services. If we can make ourselves a low cost producer of manufacturing goods, this agreement will indeed be a boon to us. But I don't see that happening in the near future. Though we do not know the specifics yet, my guess would be that manufacturing will take a small hit in India. Chinese companies should be able to take advantage of this in the short term and flood the Indian market with their cheap goods.  Viewed in totality, today is a big day for world trade, India included. Consumers worldwide are bound to get quality products at affordable prices. Only future generations will find out whether breaking trade barriers and opening up economies did anyone good in the long term. What ever happens, one biologist from England called Darwin will be smiling in his grave for his theory of natural selection (and survival of fittest) will yet again be proved right in a way he never imagined!  Ram.   * 2007 is the year when ‘fast track legislation’ expires in the US. What this essentially means is White House cannot individually decide on trade deals from then on. US Congress will have the power to alter any trade deals agreed upon by US representatives in WTO
