        Martin and I had our date last night and I'm still smiles. Unfortunately, he's leaving for Daytona tomorrow for testing because get this....he's a race car driver for the NASCAR Busch Series. I must confess I haven't been much of a follower of the sport despite my North Carolinian roots. So needless to say I'll be missing him but luckily we have free long distance on our cells :).

         So last night I was content with the prospect of staying in with a few beers and relaxing but Missy was pretty persistent about me going to a party with her in Mooresville where I had never been before. Since she is my best friend I finally gave in however I didn't put to much effort into my appearance since I knew I'd probably just be getting druk anyways. Besides, I wasn't exactly expecting to meet any decent guys that way.      Boy was I ever wrong! After a few beers, Missy and I decided the pool table would make a great dancing surface so up we went without a second thought. That was when I looked across the room and saw him - a really good looking dark haired guy with the prettiest brown eyes and I sure am a sucker for the tall dark and handsome type. Being that I obviously wasn't shy, I jumped down to find him cause I just had to meet him before another girl got to him and before I knew it I ran into him - literally and my beer made itself at home all over his shirt which was kinda embarassing but luckily due to my drunken nature it was also excusable. We spent the rest of the night close by each other tossing back drinks and just having a good time until I guess he amd Missy decided I had had enough.      This morning I woke up dazed and confuzed with a slight hangover not to mention I was late for lunch with my mother which was an interesting experience in itself. I think she had a good laugh at me for being hungover and she could tell I had met someone but I wasn't willing to jinx anything by talking to her about it. As soon as I arrived home I crashed in my nice soft bed only to be awoken by a call from the one and only Martin. I will say that it was a great wake up call to hear his voice. So we're going out tonight and hopefully, I can keep the drinking to a minimum so he doesn't assume I'm just another sorority girl because that part of my life is pretty much coming to a close now.      I'll update again after the date.       Mandi             *Disclaimer: this blog is a work of fiction for a fiction character. Please visit the link for a full disclaimer.
