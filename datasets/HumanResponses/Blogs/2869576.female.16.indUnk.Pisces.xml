      Yay!  Today is over, at least the school day is over so I don't really have to think at all until about tomorrow.  Horray Not Thinking!  Physics was easier than I though, come to think of it so was English and French.  Man, tomorrow, Deepa and I are going to kick so much ass.  Well, Deep will recieve a hundred percent while I miss points for her hating me.  But whatever.  I'm floating around One Hundred Squared right now, man I love this site.  In case I never get my links to work here's the url  *http://www.precious-kisses.co.uk/ohs/*  It's mostly Buffy stuff, but now Mys is getting into a lot more fandoms.  Slash is so not my thing but I love what she does.  And there's tons of Billy Boyd, so I could just die.  My would-be-hobbit-lover is oh so sexy.  Buy my would-be-hobbit-husband is almost non-existant, I will have to speak to the dear woman, because I do love him so.  I have got to figure out how to put that Format icon she made me somewhere on this blog, because its so damn good.  Jake was uber funny today, I must admit.  It just seemed like fun for some reason.  I'm really hungry, I forgot my lunch and had some chips and a soda, and Poorvi called me a pig.  Which hurts in that special way that even when you know your friends don't mean it or whatever, they still said it.  It's that way with Garrett a lot of times.  Speaking of the dear boy, the guys and I went to the mall yesterday.  It was fun, Chris needed a new faceplate for his phone, and everyone kept telling him they didn't make them.  I have to tell you, the phone is kinda sexy in black.  It was fun, stupidness was said all around.  I got a really pretty skirt from Lerner, which is finally back to fabulous sales.  I can't wait for those great pants to go on sale, or maybe the pinstripes blue pedal pushers that look  like capris cause I'm short.  I have  been deprived of shopping for far too long.  I can't wait till Car comes home so I can finally shop like a mofo.  That will be so good for my well being.  I should probably get going, cause I really think Chris and I should make a park date, it'd be good to talk some stuff out with the dear boy.  I think I just have to end on this note: Me-*to Chris*Your hair is being all funny. Garrett-Yeah, its like this mix between bed head and sex hair. Me-Oh, Jake and I do that sometimes.

      I'm updating, happy now?  Jake's all like 'you got a blog but  you never update it.'  And I'm all like 'maybe I'm busy.' and he's all like 'wha??'  and I'm like 'sha. yeah.'  Which is all true...for the first two sentences.  But I really have been busy.  Last weekend I was working the whole time, and this weekend I went up north for that retreat thingy.  Which was fabulous by the way.  I got me some pictures, and some memories, and Jillian was awsome.  We talked Saturday night after my little breakdown.  I really do miss my mom sometimes.  And often its hard to make the distinction between me and Lori and Carolyn's sister or Garrett and Chris's friend.  I guess that's life, which is cool.  We have like no homework, but that's just cause of AIMS, which sucks ass in the worst kind of ways.  But we'll do it and excell like the little overachievers we are.  Oh, my god, so Sex & the City finale was last night, and it was fabulous.  Mostly because Carrie's with Big, who's name is John but will always be Big, and Miranda likes Steve's Maaa, even though she donesn't want to, and Smith came from Canada to tell Sam he loves her, and Harry and Charlotte found their baby, which is adorable, and they have a baby.  Man, but i would have liked to see Alek get his ass kicked by Big, cause that would have been so pimp.  But it was sooo good, so good.  And when Carrie tells Big he's gonna have a heartattack I could not help but laugh, and when she asked if he watned to come up and he said Abso-fucking-lutly, I could have died.  I'm in awe of the fabulousness that was this show.  And I miss it already, and I kinda wish Aiden had shown up, even though we've been down the seeing Aiden road again before, still it would have been good to see Carrie's great loves.  I have to figure out some stuff on my computer before I go insane, I'll write more later.  Does that make you happy dammit!  Just kidding, I love you Jake.   Fav Quote Ever! Nick: The moral of this is-poop like Jesus.

      I got a blog. Peer pressure, does that make me awful? Jake got one, and Andrew's is divine, so I just HAD to. Plus, people kept on being all up in my grill about the fact that I have a journal, but refuse to give out the addy. So here all you bastards, this is for you.   I kinda like the blog vibe, it doesn't have to be long, and I can just chronicle my life not all my inner-most emotions. Though those will probably pop up because they rule my life.   I don't want to work this weekend, and I'm all sick and the such. But I really need the money, because I NEED to go shopping. I haven't gone really shopping in over a month, its unheard of.   Sometimes I like Mrs. Rosenberg, its odd, and it usually passes, but still. Cirino confuses me to no end, I'm think she might like me, just not like me as a French student. Which makes sense, because I wouldn't like me as a French student much either. Hell, I just plain don't like me some days.   I have to shower and eat before Mr. John picks me up, so I will bid you adieu. To you and you and you.   Me: Tape? *offering said tape as a gift*  Jake: Thank you.

      There is a movie called Rollercoaster.  The 1999 version, not the 2003, and it is amazing.  Everyone who reads this should watch it and see and be amazed because it will change you.  Onto the actual blogging.  I will discuss the fabulousness that was Thursday, and then the still fun but far less fabulousness of Friday, and the on par with Friday fabulousness of today, Saturday.  So, first off, Thursday.  It was my birthday party, which is really just another excuse for Chris, Garrett, and I to act randomly stupid.  So, we decide to rent movies, which is all good and well.  Garrett and I walked to Chris's house, and he kept on wanting to put his soda can in some guys truck bed, but that's stupid because Chris's house is a hop, skip, and a jump away, so why not just throw it away there, and not potentially piss off some guy.  So, we pick Chris up, who complains from the get-go.  But he's Chris and we love him so.  So, we get to the video store, and they are out of Bring It On Again!  I know, I know, it’s a travesty.  So, we just got Carlitos' Angels, Delta Delta Die and Rollercoaster.  I will dissect each of them for you now.  Carlitos Angels-There was a plot, but then it just disappeared, and we realized it was only there momentarily to allow for the girls to be in a strip club 'undercover'.  And by undercover, I mean not under much.  There was pot, and something called the Pallito, which was going to be rigged.  By Lou 'I'm Lou, the super' Super.  It was funny in that retarded, I don’t' know what the hell is going on sometimes kind of way.  A perfect movie for bad movie day.  Delta Delta Die-Well, there were lots of boobs.  Lots and lots of boobs.  It had a plot, but it would often be shoved aside randomly for boobs.  It was funny to watch, and I am glad we watched it second, because I did not want my mother to see it.  But we got such memorable lines as Delta Delta Die Bitch.  And some weird cat-like lunging.  It was truly inspired.  But more fun than the movie, were some of the special features.  Two of the stars are sisters, so they did a home video thing, and they were pretty funny, well one was just funny to watch.  Except then my mom came home, and we had to rush to turn it off.  Then comes Rollercoaster-To say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen is not a stretch.  It ruined bad movie day by being poignant and wonderful.  We joked at first that it would be poignant and wonderful and I made a crack about it making me cry.  Because it should have been bad, it looked bad.  And good god, I cried, at the end of the movie I had so much invested emotionally that tears were streaming.  I loved it, I still do.  I feel better for seeing this movie, and I’m not joking.  You need to see this movie, because it’s wonderful, and being sixteen, I got some of it.  I understood the pains, and I understood the doubt.  And I loved every fucking second of it.  So, after the brilliance that is Rollercoaster, we went online for a while.  I was right, Cher sang Bang Bang first.  And I like her version, because it makes it angry and rip the guy's head off mad, unlike the Nancy Sinatra, which makes you sad and lonely.  I like them both, and understand why the guys don't like Cher's, but there's this girl in me that says damn right bitch, sing about the bastard.  But I love Cher, because I can't listen to The Greatest Song I Ever Heard without wanting to shed a little tear, or After all without feeling just a little more hope about love.  Chris and I then decided to play let’s ditch Garrett.  It was fun for a while, and Garrett scared the crap out of me at one point. Ooooh, and someone stole one of our stepping stones.  I was really pissed, stupid punky kids.  We then decided to play cards on my driveway.  And my mommy gave us candles.  So, we were on my driveway in the middle of the night with a circle of candles around us.  It had to have looked like a séance to anybody who drove by.  So, we played cards until 1 in the morning, when Steve finally picked the guys up.  It was cool.  Except we spilt wax on the driveway, but that is ok.  Oops, I just remembered that I still haven’t read Garrett’s Xanga.  But nevermind that right now, so Friday rolls around and Steve takes us to Jersey Girl.  Which is wonderful.  It was a good movie.  It wasn’t so much a good Kevin Smith movie, but a good movie nonetheless.  I always expect to be introspective at Kevin Smith films, I was to think and question and doubt and feel ok about ii.  Jersey Girl was cute, and hell it had to be a Kevin Smith because I felt for Ben Affleck, I felt sad when J. Lo died.  Really, it was sad, and depressing.  I was near tears at one point, because man I felt for Ben so much.  It was sad.  But I want Kevin Smith to go back to being introspective.  I’m not saying it needs to be in-between casual talk about sex and drugs, but I just want it there.  And, good god I never thought I’d say these words, but there doesn’t even need to be Jay and Silent Bob.  Any of you who know me know I live for the character of Silent Bob.  It has spawned this freakish crush-like thing for Kevin Smith, but it’s more like an I want to sit down and have coffee and talk about the world more than a crush.  Later that night I saw Scooby Doo 2.  It was wonderful in that way that Seth Green was on screen often.  I love him so, and he wasn’t it, so I was happy. The guys mocked me, but hey, he’s vastly adorable, so back the hell up.  He is very cute, and he and Linda Cardellini were cute together too.  Man, it was so good.  And I called Alyson ‘Lauren’ accidentally.  I had to apologize profusely.  It was bad, and she called me Carolyn.  Today was really nice.  The guys and I went to the park and hung out.  We played Mau, which Garrett still never should have taught Christopher.  And then we just lay in the grass and talked.  It was lovely.   Quotes  Chris-Infraction…you’re stupid.  Chris-Are you gonna blog it?  Chris-*after I put a Jack of clubs* Oh, spades. Me-Oh, clubs.  Me-*running inside*Oh my god, my mom is home, hurry.  Turn it off!  My mom-As I returned the videos I wondered if you were watching soft-core porn.  Garrett-Well, it would have been better but they spent the entire movie budget on pot.  Chris-I’m tired.  Can I go home? Me-You’ve been walking for less than a minute. Chris-I know!  Garrett-Cross… now. Chris-Excuse me, this is my neighborhood.  Cross now.  Chris-We live on the ghetto side of cactus. Me-There is no ghetto side of cactus where we live.  Chris-Let’s keep it to English and African tribal clicks.  Me-I was sick, there was NyQuil involved.

      I'm very sick.  I was burning up this morning, and then the cable people called.  So, its far too early and I'm awake.  Except I'm all hopped up on drugs.  Of the Dayquil variety, okay.  And my mommy loves me because she got me ginger ale, and I didn't even ask for it, I just asked for orange juice.  I'm kinda off.  We've learned that I shouldn't really do stuff when I'm sick, because I get even weirder.  But, screw that, here I go.  I guess I'll talk about laser tag.  It was really fun.  Except the black lights made me queasy.  Like, really, after the first game I dry-heaved in the bathroom.  It was pretty bad.  But the second game was better.  The third went back to being kinda bad though.  I started having trouble breathing at one point.  I always shoot Nathan.  I don't know what my problem is.  Like, Kenny does it on purpose, but I always just happen to shoot Nathan.  And Rocky kept on shooting me, and the first game he kept on following me.  But I shot him back.  I felt really bad about shooting Nathan, and he would always scream that it was him, and then he'd like grab my shoulders.  And when I finally realized it was him, we'd be a pretty good team.  There were these kids there that were really annoying.  One of them kept checking me out, in that creepy kind of way that makes you want to go behind some massive object and out of their line of vision.  And they were so dumb.  Some of the littler ones kept on covering their sensors, or they'd grab my laser and move it.  I was pissed.  But all in all it was pretty fun.  Chris told the guy it was my birthday, so I got to Vanna it up.  Peter is very tall, and I am very short.  It was too bad that Garrett couldn't come.  He would have had fun.  And Chris brought me orange soda, and I love him so.  Scooby Doo 2 comes out on Friday, and I must say I am so excited.  Okay, so the only reason I'm going is becasue Seth Green is in it, but that, that is so not the point. He's so vastly adorable.  So does Jersey Girl.  Kevin Smith is my muse.  I am so obsessed.  It'll be sad though, the lack of Jay and Silent Bob.  I love the really poigent lines Kevin Smith would give himself.    As par Chris's request, I will mention it here that it was he, not Garrett, who made the 141 Proof Barro's Pizza comment.  And Garrett is a follower.  We mostly just want to see the point when Garrett gets his internet back, and finally reads my blog again.  Quotes  Chris-*points at kid and makes a throat slicing motion* Kid-*points finger like a gun at Chris* Me-Christopher, he's like 10.   Chris-So.  He started it, that little punk. Me-Good god, at least you aren't throwing him against the wall.  Garrett-Fire crotch, as Chris likes to call him, is over.  Me-What should my codename be? Chris-How about skank. Me-I am not going to have my codename be 'skank'. Chris-That's where skak comes from. Me-The entire place doesn't need to know that.  *Newest Part of my Blog* Music of the Moment Divit-Dressing Room

      I'm gonna be cool, and use this time to discuss all the things people have said to me via my guestbook. That's right, all two of them.  And if you really want to be mentioned, write stuff down too.  Even if its mean, cause then I'll just bitch you out in writing.  First, Andrew: Yes, Jake does need to update, and go through the grueling process that is signing up for another thing. It's long and tedius(sp?) but we all must go through it.  He probably signs up for a billion things a day.  Or is that just me?  For the record, my blog makes sense to me.  Which is all that really matters, because hey, its all about me.  I know, I know, and I'm modest too.  It's really dumb that people leave flames without giving names (and I did so not mean for that to rhyme).  Now I'll have to start giving  you compliments without my name on it to even things out.  And thank you very much, I'm glad I'm a good read.  Just don't try to understand my mind honey, its really not worth the effort.  And then I'd have to try and understand it, and there'd lots of work and effort involved.     Second(and first, cause you were the first) Jake: Thank you for being my first signer.  Jake, Jake, Jake, the apple of my eye.  You are a glorious person, and I adore you to pieces(I'm not be sarcastic for the record).  It's always nice when your friends can bring up the traumitizing things your parents have done in a very suble way.  And lots of glorious details will be coming you way.  I assure you.  Every little thing worth saying about Fred will be said to you my dearest Jake.  Oh, let's start with, yes, he is kidna shady, but not in the "child marriage business" kind of way.  Just the vastly older than anyone I should date ever kind of way.  You are a doll, and thank you for saying I'm not bitchy all the time, though really, if you spent obscene amounts of time with me, you would see that I do have a tendency to have random bitchiness.  And you are so wonderful, in case you didn't read it ten seconds ago.  Also, I did call you earlier in break, your mother said you weren't available, and I thought you might have gone to Jessie's, which is fine.  I'll call you later.  We'll do lunch.  Maybe watch a movie.  A certain movie.  A movie with 3 D's in the title.  You know what movie I speak of, do you not?  Lastly, what the hell is 'afaefamgkalgmla'?  Really, cause I was oh so confused.  I'll update later about laser tag, which was fun, especially cause I shot Nathan about twenty times, and like 19 were on accident.    Until then, I bid adieu, to you and you and you.

      I’ve been freakishly emotional as of late.  Who knows?  One minute I’m close to tears, and the next I get really pissed.  And I’m just plain bitchy all the time.  I have no idea what the hell my problem is.  But, I think I’ll live.  I’m going to work at getting a tan today, because I am very, very white.  And I will recap my spring break thus far.    I’m kinda sick, and it’s early-ish as I type in Word.  So the dates might be off, but I do know I did everything that I put in here.  On Friday, well I think, I went out like a wild woman.  I really believe this is the night Rocky, Dennis, Emily, Garrett and I went out and about.  Emily and Rocky called me and invited me to go to the mall, so I went, invited Garrett, Rocky invited Dennis.  It was good times.  Well, okay, so Garrett and I spent most of the time in our own little bubble.  But come on, I get to see the boy all of never, as opposed to the everyday that I see Emily and Rocky.  So, we bubble ourselves, and Emily probably put it well when she said I had time with Garrett, and then there was time with everyone else.  We went to see Hidalgo, but Garrett didn’t come.  It was fine, though I still made him feel guilty about it.  Which was really fun.  Rocky and Emily think Garrett doesn’t like them, and it’s not that.  He doesn’t not like them, but he has issues, and I love him all the same.  My other mother bought me a lovely bracelet.  It’s a silver chain link; a-la Tiffany’s, though not from Tiffany’s because they are crazy expensive.  In the past month I have gone from simple silver chains, to hearts. Many hearts.  And I love my other mother dearly, because she is fabulous.    Garrett reminded me that baseball season is coming up at the park.  I love little league.  It’s always so much fun going down to our old stomping ground and messing around on the swings and in the sand.  Speaking of swings, Chris, Garrett and I went on some recently.  On Saturday my mom’s school had their pancake breakfast.  So, we were up and ready early, had some pancakes.  After eating there was a big heap of nothing to do while my mother talked, so we went on the swings. It was really fun.  Chris decided to be five again and made fun of Garrett and I when we started swinging in unison.  But then Chris and I started swinging in unison, so Garrett kept on telling up we were going to be married.  And then Chris and Garrett started swinging together, causing Chris to dig his heels into the sand immediately, effectively stopping all movement.  After KIVA, we went to the mall.  I got an uber cute skirt, black with buttons and a nice pair of linen pants from Lerner.  I had this crazy good smoothie, with cranberry juice, pineapple sorbet, frozen banana and raspberries.  It was so good.  Chris had to be home by 2, so we left kinda early, got him home and then my mom took Garrett and I out to eat.  It was nice, we went to Chili’s.  I had the Monterey chicken, which I love. They put tomatoes on it, but that’s ok.  And when I got home, I slept for a couple hours.  It was so nice, the sleeping.  On Sunday, my mom took Chris, Garrett and I to see Dawn of the Dead.  I loved it, I thought it was wonderful.  It was cool, not really creepy, but cool.  Nothing like a little movie about consumerism to start your day.  We went to Chris’s house before and after. So, I love video games.  Before I went to Chris’s I played Tetris for insane amounts of time, and then at Chris’s I played a little bit of Buffy, and then Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, which is so much fun.  But my real favorite, is Timesplitters 2.  That game is so pimp.  Its really fast pace, and I like when we’re all on the same team because I’m not that good, so I’d rather them not be against me.  But god is it fun. Phantasy Star Online is pretty fun too, but my person sucks ass.  At least she’s pretty.  I spent yesterday at Chris’s house too!  It was fun, we mostly played Timesplitters 2, and a little Phantasy Star Online, oh and James Bond a bit.  It was good times.  I had to leave at like six thirty, so early compared to the midnight on Sunday.  I had a Dollars for Scholars meeting at Suzi’s house.  After that I watched the Soprano’s, and oh god do I love that show or what.  It is so beyond fabulous.    And there it is, the first four days of my Spring Break.  Good god did I spend freakish amounts of time with Chris and Garrett.  Quotes-I know there are more, but remember, sick, tired.  I’ll post more later, when I remember them.  Chris: Oopsie poopsie!  Me-I don’t know what my problem is, I’m not PMSing or anything, I’m just moody. Garrett-Oooo-kay.  Chris-Yeah, we had the 141 proof Barro’s Pizza.  Chris-Do you want to play something else? Me-No, we are staying here until I kill the goddamn monster. Garrett-We don’t have all day Katharine.  Chris-Hee hee hee, I got a picture of Kat looking at the adult books.  Garrett-You know, Chris has a lot of incriminating pictures of you.  Money laundering, looking at adult books, wearing a skirt as your top on the parking garage.  Me-Why don’t you have any normal pictures of me?  Me-This was so much fun. Chris-Are you gonna blog it? Me-Of coarse. Hey, that can be our new saying.  'Are you gonna blog it?'.  Me-How many times do I have to remind you two that you're on the same team and shouldn't be fighting one another?

      I was going to post yesterday, but my computer spazed out on me.  I was so sad too =(.  And Jake was mad, not really mad, more like hello, you said you were gonna post. So here it is, last weekend to my birthday and a little bit of this week.  So, this weekend was pretty fun.  Garrett's little play was on, which was cool.  Chris, Car, my mom and I all went and saw the boy be boring, or Bo Ring, if you will.  We then went to go see Secret Window, which was weird.  It was good, kinda suspenseful, and then it just got weird.  I was like, whaaa?  But Johnny Depp is so beyond wonderful, that I just couldn't help but adore it.  I liked the braces, that was halarious.    Not much happened, really, it was pretty lazy.  Not that its a bad thing.  Andre House was on Sunday, and the guys are idiots, and act like five year olds often.  But I love them so very much.  And then it kinda sucked, because I found out Fred almost got himself arrested.  I was so pissed, so pissed.  I can't believe he would be so goddamn stupid.  I was beside myself.  I was so mad at him, so mad.  I still am, don't' get me wrong.  This is as bad as the time Bobby sewed his hands for him.  I could just scream.  So, good news, my birthday was on Monday!  Yay 16!  I got fabulous things from my family.  Mommy bought me the stereo I wanted and it is so lovely.  Chris bought me Tetris Worlds.  This makes him my favorite person ever.  Garrett is vastly adorable.  He got me a basket of wonderfulness.  It included sparkling cider, a shirt with *Kat's eye for the straight guy* because of his makeover idea, and massive amounts of candy.  And I mean massive.  And a mixed CD, with explanation and everything. God, the boy is so adorable.    I went to a movie, cause if they're gonna give it to me for free why the hell not. I go up to the guy at the box office and just put my permit down and exclaim "It's my birthday."  Not what movie I'm going to or anything else.  Nope, just that its my birthday.  He just stared at me and then Car and Garrett started laughing and then I started laughing.  It was pretty damn funny.  Saw Starsky and Hutch again, and man it was even funny the second time around.  Because you guys, its not a boat, its a yacht.  We ate at Yummy China, and damn it was yummy.  They have such great food.  Chris burned me freakish amounts of CDs, I don't know if I mentioned that, but he did.  And I love him all the same for it.  And then Fred did it.  Officially, he did it.  He pedestaled me, and I cried and I cried, and I didn't tell him until I was done.  He thinks its stupid, he doesn't tell me as much, but he does.  And god, all he did was say that the fucking song was exactly how he felt about me, and I just about died.  Its horrible, because now, I have nowhere to go but down.  All over a stupid Hoobastank song, which I do love very much, yet can't bring myself to watch or hear anymore.  And I still asked Rocky to burn me the CD today, does  that make me masochist or what.  The week is almost over and I'm so glad, and woo hoo.  Spring Break!  Its gonna kick so much ass.   Between Carlito's Angels and Bring It On Again, its gonna be so pimp.  I can't wait, and it'll be fun to write too.  Quotes  Me-That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and I'm friends with Chris and Garrett.  Car-It's probably one of your boyfriends calling. Me-Yeah, it probably is Chris or Garrett Lex-Boyfriends?  As in plural? Car-Not really, just her friends Chris and Garrett.  Or as I like to call them: The Triad of Stupidity.  Chris-Are you making T-Shirts? Car-Yes, yours will say 'Grandpa' on the back.  Me-Yes, I like Cher dammit.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Which is why I don't mention it outside of this car.  Rosie-And the electrons in the seventh energy level are like...? Me-Can't hold us down.

      Blog update party!  Let’s start with last weekend.  It was not nearly as fun as the weekend before, and that’s not just because I only saw Chris that one time he was in the car next to me by accident when I went to pick up Car from the airport.  No, it was just fairly uneventful.  Well, except Car came in on Saturday and we shopped like mofo’s and then Lori came in on Sunday.  I went to go see Starsky and Hutch on Friday.  It was funny, but more importantly Garrett and I had much fun.  Allison thinks we’re dating and he is one cheap bastard because I so had to pay for his food and drink because he has no money.  For this reason I would like to refer to Garrett as a scrub.  Saturday Car came in as mentioned above.  We went shopping and I got some clothes and then I got some other nonsensey stuff.  And then there were the tapes, and Lori refused to buy me a tape player for my birthday (but its ok because of what she did get me).  Mom decided we needed to go to Vegas for a day and half.  Which is pimp in so many ways.  We stayed at the Paris, and I refused to speak French, mostly because it is not a requirement to work there to speak French.  It was so pretty.  We saw the Bellagio water show form the top of the Eiffel Tower, it was fabulous.  Best part of my week: Tiffany’s!!!!  Man, that store is so wonderful in so many ways.  So, Car and I are shopping and we walk into Tiffany’s and she’s like you have $200 and I’m like what, and she’s like yeah, and I’m like what.  And it was so cool.  I got this great silver necklace with a heart pendant.  It is so pretty.  I had a bunch of fun in Vegas, some really good times with my family.  Us sitting around at tables is always interesting.  Car is beyond funny sometimes.    Oh funny sidenote-So Carolyn had contacts, but forgot her contact case.  So in her *infinite wisdom* decided to put them in a glass of water which she put by the window seal.  Long story short, we are sitting at lunch and she tells us all she did this and my mom’s all "Oh, the one in the bathroom" and Car is just no, the one on the window seal.  My mom blanches and is like ‘Oh my god, I drank that.’  So, my mommy drank Carolyn’s contacts.  Funny stuff people, funny stuff.  I also bought a couple shirts in Vegas (one from Coca-Cola or Pimper than Pepsi as I call it and one from Express) and great new Guess sandals, which are so pretty, and some nick knack things.  I won’t post what I got Garrett because he reads this, but damn it is so good, you have no idea, it is just so good.  And funny as fuck.  I was so tempted to get a The Bitch Is Back shirt from the Elton John store, cause I think I need a shirt that says the bitch is back.  It was some good shopping all around.  I was so tired on the plane though, and I drooled a little.  Traumatizing too, because I was facing toward the isles, so whenever ever the man stewardess would come by I’m sure he saw drool.  And the next day at school was so blah.    Oh weird sidenote-So, Garrett reads my blog and gets pissed about my comments on his driving.  He doesn’t mention the fact that he sometimes makes me feel like shit, which I just about spelled out.  And in this moment of introspection, I kinda got why Rocky always says that stuff.  And Chris reads my blog and is like, What do you mean I don’t deal well with people.  And I had to reattle off about five examples before he finally believed me.  The week was really weird, being all cut in middle by spontaneous "Crazy Ho Trip" as Jake likes to refer to it.  But now it is over and I am so happy.  Chris and I went shopping.  I got some pants and a new dress from Lerner, sandals from Old Navy and some more underwear because I have an obsession.  And they make it so easy for me, damn you Victoria’s Secret, with your 100% cotton panties sales.  Damn You.  It was uber fun to spend like four hours bumming around the mall.  And we ate at Panda, because Chris loves it so.  I love it too, and we had orange chicken, the Sacha chicken with asparagus and the black pepper chicken.  I adore the black pepper chicken.  And he is such a woman sometimes, especially when reading Us and People and In Touch, but that is why I love him.  He’s so funny shopping for clothes, and I am really loving the shirts he picked up.  Especially the gray one and the brown one from Old Navy.  The weather was good too.  Very nice.  We sat outside Starbuck's and talked.  Chris took a picture of me, but it was mostly about my boobs.  And then when we went into Michaels' he had me record stuff on his phone and it was so funny.  The Many Quotable Quotes  Car-…So I put them in a glass by the window, and five seconds ago found out mom drank them.  Lex-And then the guy says, "If we were in Spain, I would slice your face."  And I’ve heard people say they’ll kick my ass or kill me, but slicing my face?  That’s kinda personal. Me-I think it’s the "If we were in Spain" part that really made the threat.  Me-If we were dating I would so dump you because you’re gross. Garrett-If we were dating there would be a lot of dumping. Me-Excuse you, I am a prize to be won. Garrett-I was saying you would dump me all the time. Me-Oh, well, then yes.  Me-Today, Rocky kissed my arm. Fred-Are you saying that to make me jealous? Me-No, I’m just letting you know. Fred-Ok.  *after a minute* Why the hell was some punk kid kissing your arm? Me-You are jealous.  Tiffany’s Security Guard-*upon my purchase* Congratulations.  Chris-*paraphrased* I miss that Crow poster we found that we were going to return so we could buy stuff.  Now I know how the person who lost it feels.  Lori-You are so dumb. Me-Your cat's dumb.  Man, I’m so hungry. Lori-That’s some good train-of-thought you got going on there.

      Updating. Yay!   Um...lemme see what happened this weekend. It was beyond fabulous. Chris and I were together every waking moment. I'm so serious, you have no idea.   Here is a recap of Friday: Came home and bummed around for a while. Talked to Chris and Garrett a bit. Garrett went to the basketball game, and I was honest and told him I wasn't up for it, because I wasn't up for me. Props to me for being honest. So, Chris, who hurt his shoulder on this major scale, and I decide to rent movies and veg out on junk food. Yay, junk food. So, we rent House of the Dead and Wrong Turn. Wrong Turn had its moment, it was suspenseful when it wasn't being completely predictable. House of the Dead was dumb as hell. I could have screamed, well actually I just kept falling asleep. It was stupid, and boring, and the ending made no sense and I know I wasn't asleep that much. But there was popcorn, Girl Scout cookies, licorice and orange soda involved in the watching, so it was ok. Chris is fun. I mean, there's a reason why I can tell the boy everything. And his heating pad is to die for. And his bed is really comfortable (Marcy, stop reading into this). Fun was had by all. Except Garrett because Shadow lost.   Saturday Recap: Shopping! I love to shop. It’s so wonderful. So, the guys and I went to Best Buy for CDs (I got Taking Back Sunday and Switchfoot. Fabulous, both of them). Then the 99-cent store, where I got some facial moisturizer because I've been dry. The guys bought massive amounts of food, it was crazy. We then walked to the mall. It was damn cold too. Chris and I shared some Panda Express, which is uber yummy. And we tried new things, so yay us. Ooh, I bought this really pretty skirt from Lerner, it was only like 10 bucks down from like 40. Yay me and Yay deals. And Chris got his phone fixed by this honey working at the phone kiosque. The guy who installed his sexy black faceplate left a fingerprint and dust, so he got it cleaned. We chilled in Brookstone for a while, which is always noteworthy. We went to Garrett's afterward and hung out there until the play. We mostly bounced around the internet, which was fun.   Sidebar: The beginning of More Than Fine on the Switchfoot CD sounds so much like The Way You Move, with the clapping and such   Back on topic. The play was Saturday night. It was so lovely. And I really enjoyed Between the Lines more than Adaptation. A little tear did roll down my cheek during Nadine's bit. It was sad, dammit. And there was some hill rolling. Rocky joined Chris, Garrett and I, which was uber fun. We are so goofy together. Chris needs work on dealing with people, and it was kinda funny when Rocky was afraid of Matt. Chris's kung-fu persona is called China, and god the boy is so fucking fun. We made up a game rolling down the hill, slow motion/fast motion. It’s the best game EVER. Jake rolled with us once, and Chris put grass down my pants. It was a glorious evening. And Garrett drove home, and he has acceleration issues. It’s kinda funny, because I know I'm not that much of a spaz at turning. I just have centering issues.   So, my fabulous weekend came to an end on Sunday, when I felt like shit. I was just so blah. Much like this week. It’s so boring, and dumb, and boring. Nothing is going on, nothing I tell you.   Today blew, today blew cheese (do you get it? do you get it? Cause she drinks). It was raining, outside and in my soul. Not really, but you get the idea.   Garrett is a bit inept, because he can't figure out blogs. I don't know why, but he's an idiot. An idiot I love to death, but an idiot nonetheless. We talked for an hour after Angel last night, which we haven't done in forever. I ALWAYS talk to Chris more than I talk to Garrett, but yesterday it was best friends vibe. Which is cool, cause I've been wanting more. I still need to talk to him, but that will come with time.   I think I'm done. Is it sufficient Jake? I love ya, and sometimes I need a kick in the right direction to actually write in this thing.    Me being an idiot quote:  Me (on the phone with Rocky): *to C+G* Just go without me, I'll be in here on the bed talking to Rocky.  Garrett: He's getting his phone fixed. You're on it.  Me: *to Rocky/sheepish smile* Hey I gotta go, but I'll call you later.

      Not a real update, more just giving my props to Hoobastank and also Rocky.  See, it was Rocky who gave me this CD, and good god I love it.  I absolutely think its amazing.  I'm listening to it, gettign all the tracks down and programming and I'm at a loss because I want all of the songs first, and I don't want to have to wait for twelve songs to get to one, but then I don't want any of them to be moved.  It is just so damn good.  And Rocky was such a doll to burn it for me.  Thank you honey.    Oh, and everyone should go to Garrett's Xanga and give him feedback (even if you don't know him or like  him*Rocky*) because I think he kidna had a breakdown.  He started to write in all CAPS and it scared me quite frankly.  So, here's hoping he didn't really crack.  I'll write about Chris's wonderful art after I've seen it.  But I can tell you now, its wonderful.

      There is a point to this post.  I am kinda angry.  I was listening to the first CD Garrett burned for me (aptly titled 'My 1st Mix) and making my own programmed list on my computer.  So, because I can't remember half the artists or song titles, I have to Google them and all.  So I google Dear Claudia, which I just told Andrew he has to listen to becausee its so goddamn funny and that goes for everyone who reads this blog, and I see that Thrice did a version.  I mean, I like Thrice as much as the next girl, but South FM made that song theirs with their awsomeness.  I want to hear this Thrice version and see if it has the same beginning tabs and everything.  Because, that song will just not be the same if it doesn't sound like some damn ballad in the beginning.  That was the funniest fucking thing in the world, sitting with Car in our car and thinking wow this song sounds really sweet and sad, and then its like try not to sleep with your best friend's boyfriend.  man, so awsome.  Now that that's out of my mind, we'll move onto the acutal blogging.  On Saturday I was supposed to go out with the guys and my mommy to see Kill Bill Vol. II, but Chris had to grandpa sit so those plans were scratched.  Instead, I went to the bookstore and read a book.  It was called Gingerbread and was amazing.  I think I just really connected with the lead, because I can get that being a 16 year old girl.  It made me kinda teary at the end, but man it was deep.  Later that night Jack had a game, so I went down to the field with Garrett.  We actually stayed and watched the game.  Well, I didn't really watch, I kinda kept on drifting off into my own little Katharine world.  But it was fun, and I had a corndog.  Which, as I look back, it's really no wonder I'm such a hefer, becaue I'm always eating like corndogs and taco bell and shit.   Sunday we finally did see Kill Bill Vol. II.  I loved it so much, I so amazed.  It was really good people, really good.  I was very happy Christopher finally got to see it, I know he'd be waiting since the end of the first one.  Plus, there was this one guy who would always toss his beard over his shoulder in a very Cher-like manner.  I always felt like making the "Hooooooooo" that Jack on Will & Grace does.  The guys and I wandered around after the movie, which was fun but by the end of it we were all pretty tired.  Well, at least I was.  I mean, I wasn't really even into shopping.  Except I totally have to get the Drive-Thru Records DVD, becuase Kenny is one it like five times and he's so goddamn cute.  I love the music (The Starting Line, New Found Glory, Something Corporate), but he's so cute.  He's like *this* close to Seth on my weird celebrity crush barometer.  I actually got to see my mother for many hours this week. She really liked it when I referred to myself as an auction orphen.  And she bought my Orangina, which is this French carbinated orange juice basically, and I love it.  I was sick and she even bought me cranberry juice and heated it for me.  Just so you all know, on yesterday's Angel, Spike was dead for a while and I was beyond happy.  I've been sick and haven't talked to Garrett or Chris in forever, which makes me sad.  I think I'm gonna give the dear boys a ring.    Just 1 Quote (becuase I've been repressing all that is Jake, becuase he's excessivly happy and I'm excessivly sick, but I still love him, as does Danni) Carolyn: So he's the nominator.  I mean barominator.  I mean announcer. Me-Ok, barominator isn't even a word.  And how the hell does that get thrown into the mix with 'announcer'?

      I feel like way better this morning than I did yesterday.  It was probably that quality Chris time, he always cheers me up.  We talk in a way that's just enough to make me forget everything else.  So, I left off on Saturday after lunch.  Well, that night I went to Word's and Music: We Love the NightLife.  It was really funny, and I'm glad I went.  Tyler Martin came, and we actually eneded up talking the whole night.  I went to the cast party afterwards at Denny's and that was really fun too.  Like I said, Tyler came and we talked the whole night.  I don't remember enjoying his company that much before, but really it was nice.  Especially the freeflow of topics like lesbian porn and how sweet people look while sleeping.  I don't remember Sunday right now, so we're just going to have to skip it.  I'm sure it was pretty uneventful, and now that I've said that something major must have happened and people will bitch me out for not remembering.  So this week was really crazy.  Just a lot of work all around.  Tuesday, though, was absolutely wonderful.  My mom came home and we hopped in the car and went down to Gammage, where we proceeded to see Hairspray.  Now let me tell you, Car and I love this movie.  We watch it all the time, and it used to be on Bonzai all the time with  Crybaby (which they want to make into a musical too) and To Wong Fu Thanks For Everything Julie Newmar (which is so fucking wonderful with John Leguizamo).  So, my mom takes me and it is so funny.  They changed a lot of stuff, but it was still so good.  We even walked over to Chili's and had dinner together.  This was the most time I saw my mother in about a month.  On Thursday was my NHS induction ceremony.  It was pretty long and boring, but still more fun than Lori and Carolyn's.  Which is mostly  because I had an actual interest in what was going on the people involved.  The guys came which was really sweet and my mom took us out to dinner afterwords.  I wore that really wonderful Issac Mizzrahi skirt, and Car was proud.  Yesterday Christopher and I went around PV Mall and looked for places we wouldn't mind working at.  I only found 5, and two of them you need to be 18, and the other was only hiring for shipping.  But that's ok, becuase Chris and I got to wander, which is always fun.  He had to babysit *just so you know when I first typed that it said babyshit* so we cut the visit short, but he called later and we talked for an hour and half.  Garrett was at a friend's party, so he missed out on our festivites.  My mom is supposed to take us to Kill Bill today, but she's feeling just rotten so we might have to postpone again.  Here are the few quotes I felt worthy  Chris-I should be a genius  Poorvi-My sister told a joke and I thought of you because it was bad like that. Jake-What was it?  Why did the curry cross the road?  Me-I'm totally telling Christopher that you refered to him as Olive Oil *in response to a whole thing about me being Popeye*  Music of the Moment Me First and the Gimme Gimmes-Mona Lisa

      So, last Friday was our auction/casino night for Dollars for Scholars.  It was uber stressful, which I hated, but still good.  Plus we more than doubled our earnings from last year.  Which is very good.  I was looking lovely might I add.  I really love that dress, but my boobs were really big in all those layers.   But as some may tell me, they’re kinda big to begin with.  Christopher was sick and just about broke my heart by being unable to attend.  We still kind hassle him about it though, which is for good measure really.  My mom and I were so wiped on Saturday.  It was sad.  She took me out to lunch and forgot to change her sunglass to her regular glasses.  But the catch is that she didn’t even notice that she still had her sunglasses on.    Later that day, I did something else.  You know, I’m really not up for this right now.  And Jake is totally right cause I’m so bipolor.  I’m just gonna update later, because I’m tired and have a million e-mails to go through, and crying would probably make me feel better too.  I’ll write more later, sorry.

      So, apperently I have a thing for guys in food service.  Like, yeah, cause there's that really adorable guy who works at Stuart Anderson's.  And then today, the guy at Island's was flirting with me so much that my mother mentioned it.  And then there's that creepy guy at Taco Bell who always hits on me, but that's creepy and him not me.  Just making a random observation here.  I'll post about last night later, cause I'm kinda sleepy right now and my mama is on the phone with Kimberly getting the numbers and such from last night.

      This one's for Andrew *and if I were a bad American Idol contestant ie anyone who's name is pronounced John on that show I would point and smile and begin my song and dance.  Oh and FYI, George Huff is the pimpest person ever.*  And I will give him so much props for Virgin Pussy, which was so creative.  And you are so vastly brave by the way, and you should be well aware by now how muchI adore you.   So here it goes, this week has sucked majorly.  I was planning on posting on Monday about my weekend, which was pretty fun and back to its wonderfulness.  But school is stupid and evil, and mostly stupid.  Damn math, and every other subject for that matter.  Especially Chemistry, but that's cause I suck and Jake is again so much better than me at stuff.  What's new.  So, on Thursday, last Thursday, I decided to be a homebody and sit around and chill and sleep mostly.  It was cool.  Friday was a bit more eventful.  I helped tutor Jake in math, which is always fun because isolated Jamison can be on occasion enjoyable.  After that we of coarse went over the mall and ate and wondered.    So, I'm a corperate whore.  I mean, here I am all happy until Jake drags me into Abercrombie and makes me try on clothes.  Which I loved, because they made my ass look so cute, and that's pretty damn hard with an ass like mine.  And even the shirt was acceptable, except for streching around the bust a little too much for my taste.  Later that night, the guys and I went to a movie (I think, well, um, yeah, we saw, god it'll take a minute, obviously it was good).  Oh, I remember, we saw The Whole 10 Yards, which was amusing enough, and obviously not that life-changing.  So, good times were had by all, especially Chris who thought he figured out the movie, but he didn't.  The guys then went to my house and stayed till about 12:30 ish.  We played Scattagories on my driveway, which was really fun.  But at the end there, I started talking to Jake online, so I got distracted. And then I was up till about 4, cause I could not sleep to save my lfie.  Saturday was spent shopping with Garrett.  We got some good things, and he really needs pants, and I tried to explain why I was getting him things, but that's ok.  It was fun, but I was crazy tired by the end of it all.  Like, seriously wasted.  So, I went home, and played tetris.  Sunday was Easter, but most of mine was spent at Andre House.  Which is fine, becuase I love the place.  We had a lot of new volunteers, which was also fine.  There was this college student Matt who really hitting on me until Lori said things about me being a sophomore in high school.  I tried to decline the offers myself, but the boy was insistant, until he realized he was about 5 years my senior.  We went to Garrett's house, but for some reason Andre House was really really tiring, so we stayed for like half an hour.  But the food was really good.  Really good, even though I don't relaly like bell peppers, so the stuffed mushrooms weren't great, I enjoyed then, but they weren't great.  So, on Tuesday I was all set for the sneak preview of Kill Bill Vol. 2.  It was going to be wonderful.  So, we go to Camelview, because that is where Christopher tells me it is.  So we go there and it is deserted, nobody is there, no one.  So, I ask for the tickets, where it says in big bold letters that its at Fashion Square 7, not Camleview.  So, we get to walk over to Fashion Squre, with out popcorn and drinks in hand becuase we have gotten them already.  And then we didn't even get to see the movie.  They had over booked it, bastards.  So, I guess I'll be waiting until Friday, and I will proceed to pout.    I have to get back to work, but here's hoping this was sufficant for you Andrew.  I'm surprised it wasn't Jake actually, because he's usually all up in my grill about it.  I dont' have time for quotes, but here's music  The Starting Line-Best of Me

      Well, my life has taken a turn for the boring.   Nothing happens anymore.  Nothing interesting at least.  This weekend should prove to be more fun though.  I’m going to tutor Jake while Chris and Garrett go to DBG (Desert Botanical Gardens for you unhip people).  And then I finally get to makeover Garrett.  It will be beyond wonderful.  I would say fabulous, but certain friends of mine have told me that I’m a lot like a gay man.  The Cher probably doesn’t help.  On Monday, Jack had a baseball game. I had to go, because as I told Lori, Garrett refuses to be his honorary older sister.  That bastard.  But we went and it was really fun.  It was fabulous one may say.  But that one is not I.  We only watched like one and a half innings before we started to wander.  I had a hot dog, and I liked it.  And some potato chips, but I’ll get to those later.  It was really nice out.  Christopher came over later on and we went on the swings.  I love those swings.  It was good to just be on those fields again.  I really, really love those swings.  But we just might be getting too big for them.  The turning was totally creepy.    Oh, and there were these annoying little kids there.  They were probably like 11 or 12 and they just looked annoying.  You know the type, they think they’re cooler than all get out.  And they wanted to go on the swings, but there weren’t enough for the little bastards.  Stupid little kids.  Monday was the highlight of my week.  It was also the day that I had Best Chemistry Period Ever.  We had this sub, and let me tell you, I now know what a bad perm looks like. Because, damn, this woman has it.  It was just, bad.  There are not enough words to describe how awful it was. I’m so serious.  But it was fun, because we were supposed to do these worksheets, but we mostly talked the whole period.  Which was cool, because I adore Jake to death.  And Matt is really funny too.  Plus, I had Jake listen to There's No I In Team, and he thought it was the same person singing both parts, and he said it made him schitzophrenic   I went to the library later that day, where I studied with Sara, Sam and Rocky.  It was really fun, and we get distracted easily, but that is ok.    See, nothing happened.  Oh, except I did make the most fabulous food for French.  I made little chocolate cups, and filled them with a chocolate orange mousse.  They were so good.  A big hit, and I even saved some for Chris and Garrett.  They would have been hurt.  So very hurt.  Um, that is really about it.  See, nothing.  Oh, and today Carolyn called.  I got home and about five minutes later she called, it was fun.  And funny too.  We always find stuff to talk about.  I don’t describe it well here, but its good.   Like Best Week Ever, which is awesome, and Farnsworth Bentley has the fakest name this side of porn.  Speaking of porn, my mother still says we watched it.  Hey, I’m totally in the mood for some Seth Green. Its either Wild at Heart or Can’t Hardly Wait.  And I’m thinking maybe WaH, but then I’d cry, cause its sad.  Man, it is sad.  He just leaves.  I'm guessing it's gonna be CHW, because I'd rather not be sad.  Today, we had to do a name game thing with the mentors in my house and we had to say our names and something we liked.  Guess what I liked?  And it wasn't Seth.  Guess again.  Yes, it was Buffy.  Because I love it so.  All of my friends laughed, and Sasha was like hell yeah.  And then I got really hyper.  Which could consequently be a bad thing.  Last time I got that hyper I ended up on the roof of PV mall with my skirt as a shirt ; ).   Here are my billions of quotes  Jake-Look at that dramaticness.  Jake-What were we talking about? Me-Your mom? Jake-No, before that. Me-Modern Humorists? Jake-No, after that. Me-Communism? Jake-Yes.  *Note: I cannot put in typing the inflection is our voices, but let me tell you, it was good. * Jake-I walked by and her perm was there. Me-Was it bad? Jake-Yes it was bad.    Movie Guy-Arbital  Jake-It has as many protons as your mom.  Jake- Are you really gonna talk about her perm? Me-Oh god yes.  I’m gonna blog it.  Jake-See, she needs help. Me-Ooooooooh. Jake-Cause she’s stronger than yesterday. Me-Noooooooo.  Sam-Come back.  I just groped Katharine.  Garrett-I love pote-a-toe chips. Me-How about those potato chips? Garrett-No, I don’t like THEM.  Jake-Heaven Me-Forbid  Me-What about he potazzium? Jake-Pizzazzium.  Me-He’s kinda creepy. Hannah-Yeah. Me-He could be like, the unabomber. Hannah-Yeah. Jake-He’s no Kaczynski. Me-Kay. Jake-He’s no Kaczynsk-K.  Sam-And then you went the special room. Me-Where we proceeded to fuck all night long Sam-Ewwww.  I don’t want to hear about you fucking  Carolyn-Why can Selma Blair have fire on her hands in Hellboy? Me-It’s her power to start fire. Carolyn-What’s a butt fire? Me-I said she could start fire.  Jeez. Carolyn-I wouldn’t be talking little miss ‘There’s no magic in Harry Potter.’  Me-My pocket is in my pocket.

      Garrett's my best friend for a reason.  Sometimes the reminders are so blatently obvious that they feel like a slap in the face, and sometimes they're subtle enough to slip by except in the depths of your memories.  Most people will never understand it, and I blame myself for most of that.  All that Rocky heard from the start was the bad, so he's not the biggest fan of the boy.  But, god, when he said I should get a new best friend I was so shocked because the thought had enver crossed my mind.  Never.  He's my best friend for a reason, and truly honestly no one but him and me need to know what it is.  I listen to 'There's No I In Team' and think that god, that's us.  It's angry, and its mad and jealous, but in the end its about what best friends mean.  And I know he'd pull the trigger, because he's him and I'm me and we can't help ourselves most times.  The boy can scare the shit out of me sometimes.  I was so worried, and never in my life have I had such a strong urge to hug someone.    I love all my friends.  I love Christopher because he drives me crazy just enough for me to forget the rest of the world.  I love Jake becuase he calls me stupid names and we have the same sense of humor.  And Sam becuase we've shared creepy religion together.  And good god I love Garrett because I don't always need to hear that I'm perfect, and he has the purest heart I've ever known.    I don't like my life, but sometimes certain aspects of it are just too good to want to leave.

      I'm so fucking tired of it all.  Because listening to this person always ends up pissing off that person.  And its everybody, everyone.  I'm so tired of making James mad because I have constant conversations with certain people.  And Chris is mad at me, becuaes I refuse to do stupid shit to placate situations anymore, and Garrett's back to not talking.  I'm so fucking done with it all.  I want to scream so bad, I just want to yell and bitch and complain.  And god knows I have to work so goddamn hard at holding my tongue all the time.  I'm fucking pissed, and its not just today, or this week.  I'm tired of the looks, and the disappointment written across their faces.  I'm just, I'm done.    I think I'm going to take a pillow to the back yard and give the screaming a go, because I'm at a loss right now.

      I just had the best conversation with my mother.  Let me tell you all about it.  Me-Mommy, do you want to go to bed? My Mom-Oh my god, you scared me.  What time is it? Me-About nine fifteen. My Mom-AM or PM? Me-PM My Mom-At night? Me-yes, at night, on Friday. My Mom-Today? Me-Yes, today, Friday. My Mom-Oh. Me-So, do you want to go to bed? My Mom-In my bed? Me-Yes. My Mom-Okay. Me-Alright, let's go. My Mom-How about later? Me-Okay. *I walk out of the room at this point*

      I was gonna update earlier, but my mommy came home and she took me to dinner.  We ate at Stuart Anderson's, mmmmm steak.  Garrett couldn't ear with us, because he's all vegitarianed-up.  And apparently talking again.  Just for the record, that got so old so fast, plus I was very displeased to hear the school report.  Bad form dear, bad form.  Nothing happened this week.  I swear to god, nothing.  But whatever.  Um, well Christopher came over.  Is it weird that I?ve started to refer to him as Christopher full time?  I kinda like it, and hey, it?s my speech.  So he came over, and promptly fell asleep.  It was really cute.  He woke up and pretended that he didn?t fall asleep, but then he did it again about two seconds later.  Even cuter.  He blamed it on my cat?s pheromones.  I am not kidding, the boy said it was the pheromones.  I knew there was a reason why I loved him so much.  And then he brought my mother into it, and I must tell you, I don?t want Christopher?s pheromones affecting my mother in any way, shape or form.  But whatever.  So, that was Wednesday, and he and Garrett came over on Thursday too.  We watched Wonderfalls, which is so funny.  I can so imagine Carolyn being like that when she?s older, only uber successful.  It?s really funny.  Garrett was still not talking at that point.  I read this story that made me cry today.  It was sad, it was this short story about a girl named Hope, and it was depressing.    This was really short, but again, nothing happened this week.  Here?s hoping I actually gain a life this weekend.  Hey, here?s my sonnet, in perfect iambic pentameter no less (but not funny like Jake?s is):  I?ll make sure to see to your survival Through the eyes of a broken heart. I still look forward to your arrival, But haven?t you known all this from the start. There are shadows that dance across my mind And memories that have yet to let go. My secrets are held by the winds of time, Broken promises you have yet to know. You can tell everyone you?ve forgotten, But your sad eyes refuse to tell those lies. Can you swear you think of them that often, Those promises of long ago good-byes? I?ll see to your survival if you stay. As day breaks chase all my shadows away.   Quotes-it?s all Christopher (p.s., I think Garrett?s should be ?put on your period face?)  Me-Chris you were sleeping again. Chris-It was the cat pheromones, they just put me to sleep. Me-*laughing* You are so odd.  *Later*  Me-Mommy, you?re sleeping. Chris-It?s my pheromones. Me-Excuse me? Chris-Yeah, they jumped from the cat to me to your mom.

      Oh god I feel like crap.  Car took me to a movie, this cute little French film, and it was dollsome, but I kept on feeling like, yes, I was going to throw up in the middle of the theatre.  And to make me feel all the better Garrett's fucking pissed, which I think is uncalled for becuase moving the order on his desk from pen to clock instead of clock to pen doesn't usually equate to having to 'clean up after us', but even then a call would have been nice before slamming me.  Seriously, we did not do that much, or at least we've done a hell of a lot worse.  I just feel awful in general, and the boy is home all of never and even though he knows nothign of the situation he could make me feel better but now I don't even wanna talk to him because I always feel judged and like he's hostile, and I really need to sleep.  And take malox, because I so don't wanna throw up all over the carpet.  Fighting with those I love does this to me I guess.  At least Christopher doens't hate me, becuase then I'd just about have to shoot myself.  Oh, and I'm still messing with my template, which is going better than expected, but not necisarily good. I have links, but its complicated kinda.  Kinda like learning to drive stick with Hank, who is the most understanding man I know.

      Oh, so, I'm gonna post some of my writings, because I keep on forgetting to give certain people them.  So, here they are, I'll tell you a bit about each.  My fav poem I wrote for English, its our power poem and Christopher will love it, so here it is for you:  He perceives power when she finally hits the ground{crashing}, And even contemplates throwing those ridiculously big sunglasses She had been so persistent{crying} about at her{shattering}. The colors start to bloom across her cheek and eye. The pigments spread, a sea of purples and blues and greens and hate. She thanks her gods of tomorrow for those ridiculously  Big sunglasses she had been so persistent{crying} about. There will be questions she will not know how to answer though. She does not thank her gods of tomorrow much. He perceives power when she stands finally, Crouched like a small child{shaking, standing}. He loses some when she walks{running} out the door. And even contemplates going after her{chasing, screaming}. But he is aware that she will be back. He is not surprised when she is.   It is a state that does not last long{smiling}. There is power in how she packs her things And the way she holds{firing} that gun. He wants to quiver like a small child And even contemplates begging{screaming, hitting}. But he is aware that she will not be back. She takes the power of this house with her out the door{finally living}.     This is the teaser for my own ending to Angel(Chris & I decided to write our own 'fix-it's):  Gunn was fading fast, Spike noted from his perch atop a LA skyscraper.  He had been gutted with his own stake and he was bleeding out in droves.  Spike could smell the blood in the air.  The air was thick with this battle, from the blood to the sweat to the smoke and everything in between.  Angel was fairing much better, but that wasn’t saying all the much.  He was handling the dragon as best he could, Spike waiting for his call to arms.  He could see Illyria from his post as well.  He could smell her tears.  He wasn’t quite sure if it was the fact that she was an ancient, or if they were just so laden with grief that he could have sensed them anywhere.  Ever her fight was thick with sadness and he again mourned this ancient and the girl who once inhibited her body.  He’d almost missed Angel’s wave through his tears.  He leaped through the air, the thickness of it all slicing around him.  Angel could handle the dragon on his own, but they weren’t taking chances, not anymore.  Angel was grasping his tail, and Spike climbed easily to its neck.  "’Ello, luv, let’s give it go, eh?"  His cockney accent never failing him as he distracted the dragon just enough to have Angel climb under its belly.  The sword felt good in Angel’s hands, like an old toy.  The weight was just enough to give enough thrust through the softer scales just above the dragon’s heart.  Spike was gauging its eyes and laughing like a menace until Angel called his name.  "Get the hell of this thing before it falls jackass."  Spike smiled at his old comrade (was that really the word for them?).  The teeth in his grin reminded Angel so much of William the Bloody he almost shivered on the spot.       My crazy long, but poignent word list poem.  It even has a quasi-story line, which is cool:  He bleeds with comic book jealousy In the back of pool halls and old diners. The wicker furniture leaves imprints on his skin  And his margin of error is wide. He dreams of leather-laced memories And love in the form of gin and tonic. Quivering, Shivering, Living in a fear-state. He has loved, but oh he has lost The pepper mill grind sand he thinks to himself  That these are truly the sounds of hell. He can remember the fibers on her clothes  And the pitch of her voice; She is a tower of perfection that he will never again know. He wonders if the cities of his youth  Have changed from their corrupt states, And if ex-husbands still chase Boys like him out of bars. The copper hits his tongue as it Snakes out and touches his lip. He already misses the Dust and the Dark and the Neon Signs. He knows that if his life were a movie, People would watch it and cry. The luster of her lips is imprinted on his brain. In side streets and back alleys, he’s  Quivering, Shivering, Living in this Damned fear-state. Footsteps sound like cymbals and he’s sure its  The gin talking when he gives up and calls. Her voice is biting, not he mellifluous ring it once was. She calls him a drunk. He does no disagree. In pasty-faced pictures he can really see his reddened eyes. He tried to go out, but those girls, They tell him he’s all Talk and no Dancing. He is everything they should want, But he is not himself. He thinks of romances, form the gothic and maudlin To the high school crushes of his past. There is not cure for his kind of sickness. The orchids are a blinding white, so as day breaks The blood vessels in his eyes scream He leaves them on her doorstep, hoping It is indeed she who first opens the door. A whole life lived and death in but a few moments. When she calls to say thank you, he does not answer. In the message she leaves, her voice is sweet as ever. She still calls him a drunk. The next time they meet, he’d still yet to disagree. As day fades he longs for his back alleys and side streets, He knows them better than he knows her. She seems like ART Galleries and Expensive WINE; He has an affinity for tequila shots and straight vodka. The next time they part, she screams. It is a tragic climax to their heartfelt story. He thinks his movie-life would be interesting. He finds it hard to forget her eyes, He thinks maybe drowning in rum might do the trick. To him, the smoke filled bars still smell like Vanilla Perfume. He’s given up on giving her orchids Because he knows by now that she is not alone when she opens her door. This betrayal burns through him like a fire-hot sword. He dreams of this man’s lynching and her horrified screams. He calls her heartbreaker And several words more SEVERE. He dreams of violet-rimmed eyes and the fist that do the work. The bruises on his mind refuse to fade. When he gets her call the words run across him like acid. He keeps orchids fresh on his table for if she comes. For when she comes. He dreams of the fists that do the Work, and his own vile Deeds. The old rusty gate hails her arrival And he can see her eyes beneath dark glasses. He knows that is how his knees will bruise As he drops in front of her. He is aware of the irony in their situation: She came for his comfort, but it is She who is holding Him. He thinks he likes drowning in Her instead.       Ok, thats it, and wow, do all of my writings have to deal with abuse.  Next thing you know, I'll be writing about Lindsey knocking around Eve.

      Hey, I'm updating.  How do you like them apples Andrew *Just like Tony when the coffee maker broke after Furio came and had coffee*.    So, I'm like randomly hyper and then down and then up again and its one sick twisted loop.  Tomorrow still doens't feel like the last day of school, but sophomore year went by without much incident.  I say much, because shit went down, just most of it didn't have to do with me.  And by now you should all know my policy on shit that does not directly involve me, mostly because I have enough of my own to be bothered with public opinion on others.  Except in some cases where public opinion is liable to get you shot, not matter what side your on.  So, Christopher and I went out to lunch today.  It was really nice, we called Garrett into it and he came by the mall and we chilled.  We had tried him earlier, but no one answered.  I got a shirt from American Eagle, and tried on really really hot, but far too expensive, sweats at Abercrombie.  Mostly, because I am a corporate whore, WHORE I tell you.  But they were really hot pants, and my ass looked decent, and thats a big step for me.  Oh, and yesterday Car bought me amazingly comfy yoga shorts at Old Navy, after getting our eyebrows done, as I now compulsivly touch mine every five seconds. But they are oh so smooth.  I don't have much to say, except, I'm back to updating reguarly.  Are you happy?  Becuase I am.  Oh, and sometimes Andrew needs to shut the hell up(you know what about boy).  And stop groping me in public, people will start to talk ;)

      This is for Garrett, becuase I love him dearly, even if he did have a minor emotional breakdown.  His are less fun than mine ever were, remember the bus?  Cause I do.  I was such a homebody last weekend that I don't have all that much to write about.  Friday was fun.  We saw Chris's art, which was wonderful.  As was everyone else's, except that creepy picture of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, because damn that was creepy.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE (not having a breakdown people!) Chris's martini people.  God, I so need a copy of the original big one.  Seriously, I'm obsessed.  We went to Jack's game after (ok it was like five minutes after because how long can we just look at art), and that was cool.  Oh, and Sherrie came to the art show cause Ms. Darnel works at the school.  We talked and I have a gig coming up, a bridge tourney, which should be fun, plus cash, yay.  And then the first week of August is regionals, which I love to death.  Here's hoping I get to work three sessions, and we can stick like Murphey with only two.  Hooray Money!  So, at Jack's game we bummed around, which was fun.  We went on the swings, again, fun.  We hung out until Chris had to leave, and then Garrett and I chilled, even though I wasn't allowed to touch him.  Which makes sense if you were there.  And I'm totally the favorite child, just so you know.  Garrett's mommy loves me, yes she does.  And then the rest of the weekend was spent with my mother.  Who I love to death really, but she is not all that interesting.  Really, she's not.  We just ran errands and talked a lot.  I was an auction orphen, but now I actually see my mother.  This week at school has been very blah.  I gotta go, my mommy just got home.

      This is all for Andrew because I think he's just grand.  Thank  you for giving Garrett comments.  Who, for the record, totally did snap.  And Andrew had some very good comments about how caps are scary.  Because when you use them excessivly, yes Garrett they are scary.  Andrew, in general, is wonderful. He's funny and smart.  Oh, and I loved the picture.  Especially the flowers, because there's nothing like a little sex between daisies.    That's all I have time for right now, becuase my mother just woke up and we should actually try and spend some time with one another.

      Oh.  My.  God.  I have never had so much fun in all of my life.  It was grand, simply wonderful.  I met Coheed and Cambria and Taking Back Sunday!!!!  I was like *this* close to start spewing fangirl at them I was so excited.  I bought the Coheed CD, and got a signed poster by all the guys, and the lead's hair is inspired.  It has Car's curly/wavy thing going, and its a complete triangle.  I love it!  I got to high five the cute one in TBS, and he happens to also be the short one so Car mocked me.  But it was so good.  Daniel made us leave early, because its so vastly not his scene, but we still did major damage.  Oh, and Car and I found out that Thrusday is totally hot, though we weren't able to see them.  We didn't get to see TBS or Flogging Molly or Authority Zero for that matter.  Because Daniel hates us :(.   But its ok.  Because Yellowcard was so good, Coheed sounds less like a woman than previously thought.  While New Found Glory did not do any covers (much to my disappointment, let me tell you) they were quite good too.  We heard rather than saw Bad Religion, but we had time to see Story of the Year (Chris'll be so proud).  It doesn't feel like I'm leaving on Friday, but, alas I must.  D.C. here I come.  It'll be really good to get away for a while.  But I have to pack, which is an event if you're me, and that'll take a while.  I have some loose ends to tie up here before I go, and that will be so blah, but I can deal.  Plus, Yellcard announced that they will be stopping here on their next tour.  WITH THE STARTING LINE!  I was so happy, and then Car made fun of me cause their lead is short too.  That bitch!  Just kidding, she knows I love her.    I have the dumbest fuckign tan/burn lines.  Seriously, I started out my day in a regular t-shirt, but about half an hour into it decided I was gonna roll up my sleaves.  I was already sporting a farmer tan by then, because someone hates me, but now I have a red hue around my shoulders, then it gets pretty white, and then back to red.  And my mom's gonna be taking thousands of pictures of me in D.C. because she's intent on scrapbooking my life.  While it sucks, it was so worth it.  Oh, I almost forgot the one spot right ar ound my hairline that I forgot to put sunscreen on so its very red.  Yeah, thats fun too.    Chris and I Fireflied yesterday, or two days ago now, but he fell asleep.  Damn those pharamones, damn them.  He missed Trash, which is so good.  But its ok, we played pool after he went home. And I beat him.  I was so happy, but then I had to go cause Lori was gonna call mom to pick her up at work.  But I won!  I'm proud of me, since I lost last time like 25 to 6.  Vast improvement here people, vast.  I'm gonna go, and probably won't be back until the 9th, when you all get to hear about D.C.  Yay!  Lucky you.  There will probably be a lot of writing, and reading, and the Library of Congress.  Is it completely sad that I'm so damn excited about that last one?  Let's just not think about it too much, thanks.  Love you guys, Kat

      So Chris decides to bitch at me.  Not really, he mostly just said I need to update more.  I then brought up the fact that he does it all of never, even though he has been pretty good lately.  We're Fireflying today!  Yay!  I'm excited.  We only have like seven left, but they're all pretty really (tm Christopher) great.      Car's birthday was on Sunday, and we partied.  Well, my mom bought pie and balloons.  We saw Dodgeball again (thats 3 times for me) and I still love it dearly.  Car and I said the Joni Loves Chachi part again, which is always good times.  Oh, but I'm mad at her, because because during the previews she made me laugh so hard after I took a drink of soda.  It got up my nose, which is so uncomfortable becuase its carbonated, so I was mad.  And then I couldn't breathe because if I did I would have spilled soda everywhere.  Sportscenter the night before was inspired.  It was Derek Jeter's birthday, so we had to watch for Car's boyfriend, and they were talking about the game.  I believe the exact quote was "Derek Jete, 2 for 4 and always dreamy". I love it.  Guess what my new favorite song is?  Seriously, its great.  Its called 'Its not a side effect of the cocaine, i am thinking it must be love'.  Thats the title.  I'm serious.  That even beats "Funeral masses for William Jennings, Viewing hours 4-6", and it is hard to beat that.  I love Fall Out Boy.  They're pretty awsome, and AP (Alternative Press) did a cover story on them and it was quite brillant.  Everyone should download the song, becuase its awsome, and the version I found is acoustic.  And we all know how i feel about acoustic music.  Heavy Sigh.  Sidenote: on Lori's laptop I always end up hitting the finger pad with my palm when I type.  At least she doesn't have hot corners like Carolyn's computer or it would shut down every five seconds.    I'm pretty addicted to The Series of Unfortunate Events.  I didn't think I'd like them this much, but, man, I do.  I like the writing style.  The diction of the author into the actual books, its wonderful.  And while thinking about these books I remembered reading Boy Meets Boy and loving it, and that in turn made me think of Abarat (which makes sense if you're me and live in my brain).  Clive Barker needs to write faster, because I want to know what the hell happens.  ANd he should go on Bill Mahr again, becuase he was totally inspired when that conservative chick was gay-bashing and he was like excuse me, I'm gay.  I was like, yay, go Clive Barker.  Then I remembered hearing about when Ian McKellen came out on public radio like the awsome god that he is.  Lori's so right, my train of thought does not make sense.  Hell, it doesn't even make sense to me sometimes.  I'm gonna go, becuase I should clean before Chris comes over and we Firefly.  Yay, Firefly.  And I have to figure out what the hell to do with my hair.  You have no idea, its HUGE.  Like, massive, and scary, and my mom made fun of me.  Love you guys, Kat

      The past couple days have been tiring.  I'm sleepy, and I feel sick, but I'm happy enough.  I went out with Rocky, Andrew and Dennis yesterday.  It was fun, bumming around Desert Ridge.  As always, the table conversation was wonderful, if not a little odd.  But we so had more fun than you can imagine.  Though the waiter kept staring at me, which was creepy.  Seriously, every time he addressed the table he would look right at me.  But I was kinda boobalicious there, and he could have been staring at like Rocky, which would have been creepier.  We saw Chronicles of Riddick, which was okay I guess, I was kinda tired in the beginning so I slept a little bit.  It was kinda a downer after that, but thats ok, becuase we had fun at the beginning.  Saw Farenheit 9/11 today.  Agree or not, you have to give Michael Moore credit for doing what he does well and effectivly.  His point was made quite clear, and his trademark humor was there as well.  It was definately darker than Bowling For Columbine, or Roger & Me, but it was also about war which by definition alone would allow for less humor.  It was downright hard to watch at times.  Several times I had to turn my head and close my eyes.  And I cried, pretty hard, because it was sad to boot.  But so worth it.  I loved it, really, and recommend it to anyone not offended by a little (or a lot) Bush-Bashing.  I have a story to finish, because it was requested and the requestor won't stop bugging me about doing it until I finally finish it.  Idiot.  I hate you.  Not really, but still.  Plus, it has to be HAND-written.  Everyone knows that while I love the written language, I don't like actually writing the written language.  Bastard.  Love you guys, Kat

      Apperently, my love for Alan Rickman is 'creepy' and 'weird' cause he's 'old'.  But no, cuase, yeah, he might be kinda old, compared to say, anyone, but he's still totally hot in that British/way smarter than me kind of way.  It was pointed out to me that someone being seeming smart shouldn't really be my qualifier when they're a gazillion years older than me, but I still do not see the point.  And I stand by my declaration of adoration (sounds pretty cool, don't it).  In other news, Chris, and now Rocky, are working on getting me to speak bad.  Really bad.  Like, AIM grammer bad.  Its not easy, let me tell you, but I'm working on it.  The hardest part is writing really badly, because writing words/not words is hard.  Really hard.  Like, SAT's hard*unless you're Andrew, who's a genius apperently.  Like we didn't already know it*.  But I'm getting better.  I even made a bad grammer joke.  It was great, and Garrett didn't get it, and correted me in that weird way that he does.  You know, when he tries to talk to me like I'm an idiot, even though we're both well aware I'm not.  You know, at least Chris knows.  And Garrett was talking, and it was rejoiced throughout my heart.    I went to go see Dodgeball again, and let me tell you, it was funny as hell again.  I love Jason Bateman, seriously, he needs more work pronto, because there is not enough of him in showbusiness right now.  Though, really, Arrested Development is enough, becuase that is some dangerously funny shit.  Watch next season, do it.  Seriously, do it.  Come on, watch that movie and tell me he's not one of the best parts (right there next to David Hasselhoff *Jekyl and Hyde Musical Extraveganza!**which makes sense if you're like two people who read this blog*  Oh, and I love Graham Norton. Like, kinda really, LOVE, Graham Norton. Which I shouldn't because he's totally gay, like, crazy gay, but he's cute and funny.  So funny.  He gave Alan Cummings a penis cleaning kit on his show for god's sake, and dont' try and tell me thats not funny.  It breaks my heart that I never saw Anthony Stuart Head on his show, becuase that would have been good times.  Good times, I say.  He is vastly adorable, really, he is.  And its sad, becuase I can't be normal and like Orlando Bloom*swoon*.  I speak fangirl, far too well for my own comfort really, but only to the obscure.  Ben gets it kinda, becuase he totally has this thing for Jodi Foster becuase she's in MENSA, so we have that bond.  Plus, I do tend to step on his brainwaves, so you never know. But we're not kindred spirits, becuase Chris is mine.    I spent like seven hours on the phone today.  A couple with Rocky and then some with Chris and then Rocky again and then Chris again and then Chris 3-wayed Rocky, so it was all three of us and our randomness.  Rocky got to hear first hand all of the inappropriate things Chris and I toss back and forth.  I think if we ever actually got into some weird situation no one would believe us becuase we're always saying shit.  But you know there was that one time we had sex at the mall before Garrett got there.  ;)  I think I'm gonna have to leave on that note, becuase oh, it is a good one.  by u guiz, i gots 2 go *how was that.  was it good, in being bad?*  All my love, Kat

      Fred broke my heart.  Well, okay, not really, he mostly just said he didn't like Story of the Year.  But that kinda broke my heart, because I have a serious And The Hero Will Drown obsession.  And he called them wanna-bes and I got all defensive and was like does that make me a wanna-be.  He called me stupid, and then he asked questions.  I passed!  Woo Hoo!  Mostly I passed because I adore The Cure and Elvis Costello (I'm allowed to like alternative, old-school style) and I'm fully aware that DI sang Johnny's Got A Problem (I can like punk, old-school style).  It was pretty funny too, becuase the song came on the Ska-punk show right after our little conversation.  I would like to thank Jake for his wonderful support, and ability to be scared for me.  I was really okay, mostly just pissed, because I figured it was one of my friends being an idiot.  But the other day I got something else, different e-mail addy, but equally creepy, so I figure its the same guy, and I'm totally wigging.  I've had a few offers to kick his cyber ass, which is really sweet Ben, really (thought it would be more convincing if you weren't drunk :).  You're stepping on my brain waves!).  Car and I decided that every day, when we remember, we need to send special telephathic waves of love to Posada, because his ears are unfortunate, but he's still vastly adorable.  And some for Derek too, becuase he's her boyfriend.  I started tennis again today, which was really fun actually.  I love backhands, oh yes I do.  And my serves are like a million times better than they were a year ago.  I'm very happy, and its totally worth getting up so goddamn early.  I think I'm done, and I'm so sleepy that I'll probably take another nap.  Kat

      I'm getting pretty reall (tm Christopher) scared.  I really thought I knew who was sending me shit, but I apperently got it wrong, and there aren't a whole lot of people who I can think of who would do it and I was almost certain I had the boy tagged, but I was a little off base, which is so creepy.  On top of the general creppiness of the situation to begin with.  And that really sick feeling in my stomach is back, and last night was really wonderful and now I'm totally going to cry.  I really hate people invading my personal space like that, so if you're reading this whoever the fuck you are, please stop.

      After several conversations with several different people, I'm much better.  Gone is most of the anger and bitterness.  I've even managed to crawl out of that deep hole of depression I managed to dig for myself and confide in Fred which is only more fair than hiding becuase I always chide him for doing the same thing.  He understands, and in a moment of a million flashing lights I remembered every last reason.  I wish I could have seen his eyes, or felt his hands in that moment.  I had this whole new kind of realization at the baseball game with Car tonight.  We were sitting around watching the game, only I was totally watching this guy in front of me.  He so wasn't my type (he had red hair and was terribly pale) but I kept on staring at him.  It took about five innings for me to realzie that it was his hands, he had these perfect hands.  They were slender and porpotion to his body and god I loved those hands, and then I thought back to what really made me stay and talk with Fred in what seems like forever ago.  He shook my hand and his were so perfect, callased around the edges and soft on his palm.    I called Danni as soon as I got in, becuase the girl gets to hear every epiphany, and she's just like 'yeah I already knew' which threw me oh so much, but her explination made all the sense in the world.  Her and Fred being buddies from way back when tell each other just about everything, so she knew all about the way I used to sit and just hold his hand between mine, and my content in the practice of lacing our fingers.  She said it made all the sense in the world that my greatest sense of loss was not holding someone else's hand.  She told me all aobut her cool weather and I told her how the scariest thing thats happen thus far is Fred disappearing.  She sounds good, which I like, and I let all of my words spill.  I kind of feel like I've given piecess of myself to so many people, and its ok when they're there because I can little pieces of them too.  But now I feel like too many have left and taken all of those pieces of me with them.  Fred tells me that he'll just have to learn to take a little less and give a little more, and that touched me far more than any other sentiment the boy has ever given me.  Except one, but thats different.  I'm feeling very much myself in this moment and I'd rather it not go to waste.  I might write more later, but I'm in the middle of a terribly gripping conversation with this boy I hold so dear.  Kat

      I'm going through and deleating all of the bits of 'my other life'.  I have a damn good hunch who it is, but its still creepy.  And I hate him for it, he should know, that I really hate him, becuase thats low, becuse he needs to learn how to pick up a fucking phone and use it.  I'm probably going to be up until three again, because I feel awful.  I hate beating around the bush, I really hate it.  But right now I mostly just wish I'd stop crying, and I wish everyone around me didn't seem to be falling away.  You really suck, you know?  Really really suck.

      You know, if I didn't know any better, I would say Jake was mocking me.  But that would be bad form!  Bad Jake, Bad.  Silly boy, and for your information I am a rebel.  Ok, so that Fraz Ferdinand song is totally the same song as that Modern Mouse one.  Seriously, listen to them back to back and you will see.  Its creepy kinda.  And its so weird, because the beginning of this one Starting Line song sounds exactly like the beginning of another Gin Blossoms song (who are so cool, no matter what Jake thinks).  Its like the Switchfoot song that sounds like The Way You Move, except not as weird and confusing.  Borrowing from Gin Blossoms is so feasable for a pop/alternative band, Christian alternative sounding like hip hop, not so much.    I can't wait until Warped Tour.  I am so beside myself.  I'm alreayd making a list of the bands I NEED to see there.  Taking Back Sunday, Yellowcard(they're best friends with Starting Line *squee* and I offically speak fangirl), Something Corperate, New Found Glory and Authority Zero are at the top of my list right now.  Bad Religion wouldn't be bad, becuase they are pretty cool, I love their latest.  Story of the Year is pretty cool, and right now they're scheduled right after Yellowcard, but thats liable to change the day of.  And I'm mad because someone told me that Bright Eyes was going to be there (I thought it was werid casue they are so emo) but I got my hopes up of seeing Connor Orberst, who is a total honey and a god when live.  But thats ok becuase I'm beside myself with excitement.  I'm so sad, becuase The Format and Reuben's Accomplice are going to be at Marquis, but I have a Dollars for Scholars annual meeting.  I'm so sad.  And Car's working, but she said if she wasn't she would totally have us skip the meeting and bask in the amazingness that is these two bands, especially when they're together. It probably woudln't be as awsome as when they were there with Jim Adkins, but still completely amazing.  But its all good, and there will be other wonderful Format oppertunities.  I gotta go help with cookies, which involves hanging out with my mtoher, becuase I'm like that.  So ha!  Kat

      I finished it!  In two days not less.  That statement, is mondo sad by the way.  I just finished the fifth Harry Potter, and let me tell you, its starting to rival Prisner of Azkaban as my fav.  I mostly just wanted to see how IT happened, but that was about seven hundred pages in, so I had to go throuhg a lot.  But I just kept reading, and I would at night and I wouldn't get sleepy from it.  I really do like the books, I'm not a fangirl or anything (though Rupert Grint with the long hair is totally has me falling) but I enjoy them.    My major complaint with the writing is that when J.K. finds something she likes, a word or turning of a phrase, she tends to use it.  Again, and again.  And again.  But thats ok, becuase I like the dialouge on the whole, and I totally cried.  I didn't even do it when it happened but later when Harry was with Dumbledore, and then again when he talked with Nearly Headless Nick.  Car didn't even make fun of me, cause she knew he was my favorite.  But it was sad, really sad, and then I was online looking at Buffy icons and there was a cross-fandom post with all these sad ones about the death of him and I cried then too.  Car made fun of me then.    I want that movie to be made soon, but thats mostly casue there's a lot of Snape.  Mmmmm, Alan Rickman.  Oh, and Car and I decided that Alan Cummings needs to be in one, mostly so he can do lots of press, cause he's awsome.  But still, mmmmm, Alan Rickman.  I just realized that I'm not a shipper in the book(which is surprising because I ship like a mofo) but I totally ship in the movies.  I think the directorial perspective has got me all into Ron/Hermione, but I read the book and still am not totally shipping them.  Though I kinda am, becuase she started dropping way more hints as it to, but still.  Danni said she was proud of me, but then I started talking all pro-B/A and she called me an idiot.    Chris and I are offically an old married couple.  And I love it.  No, it was totally cute cause yesterday we were chillin at the resort and watchin the kids cause the little rascals needed it.  Of course watching them entailed going from the uber hot hottub to the mondo cold pool.  Little punks.  But, later, we're just sitting in the hotel room watching TV.  Well, he was watching TV and I was totally reading.  I looked up at the mirror in front of me and we painted quite the picture, what with me huddled under many sheets (my toes were FREEZING) and Chris just lounging with his blanket flipping channels.  I was gonna call Rocky today, but I got lazy and then went out with ma familia.  Well, I went out with Car.  I got a Frosty too, which was yummy cause there were fries for dipping.  Mmmmm, frosty fries.    Andre House tomorrow will prove to be interesting.  I can't believe they named their kid Cher.  I'm gonna have to try not to giggle, or break out in Gypsies Trams and Theives.  I swear I'll try REALLY hard.    I'm gonna go hang out with my mother, becuase I like her.  Love ya guys, Kat

      its 3:50 in the morning and I cannot sleep for the life of me.    I ran into Dave (of krazy4kat e-mail infamy) the other day at the mall.  He looked different, taller, broader, darker.  It was so odd, but he looked really happy.  He smiled that goofy grin of his and kissed me  on the cheek when we met and left again.  It was almost enough for me to forget his semi-stalker ways.  Almost.  He was sweet about it all, and we made small talk for about ten minutes.  He offered to buy me over-sugared coffee, but that hadn't gone over so well the last time we'd had coffee so I declined.  He wasn't all that bad before really, but come on, did he really need to make an e-mail addy for it?  Really?  Oh, and I still think infinitesimally should mean something getting larger, its a big word, it really should.  Its offically off my list of words I like, but not on the list of words I hate.  Oh, and Jake is dollsome, I'll work on getting my guestbook where you can see it honey, ok.  I think I might actually be getting sleepy, so I'm gonna sign off for now.  I love you guys, really I do, Kat

      I really don't feel myself.  I think I need to stop keeping such odd hours.  But I do have to say that my week got infintessiemntly (is that a word?  cause it should be) better.  I feel so much better, but strangly enough not myself.  I think I might need some 'me' time to think some stuff out, like if its really worth it.  I'll chronicle my day with Christopher and hanging out with Rocky, Robyn and Andrew later, just kinda not up for it now.  Sorry, Kat

      This past week has been so bipolor on me.  It was alternately wonderful and beyond awful. A lot of things transpired between a lot of people I really care about, and god some of it was so bad.  But Chris really has been wonderfully supportive of my massive mood swings that I'm sure make no sense to him.  Hey, weirdness abound, I just got an e-mail from Fronczyk.  He's so odd sometimes, and random.  He said he loved me again, but thats not all that new, but never looses its creepy value.  Really, it doesn't.  You would feel the same way if some short guy randomly e-mailed  you and said he was in love, you so would.  I'm guessing next week won't be so stressful, becuase this one was way beyond awful.  I'm even talking to Garrett again, and sorta over it, but still only when Chris is on the line too, becuase I'm weird.  I'm actually kinda tired, which is sad becuase its like nine thirty, but not all of us can sleep until four pm, so i'm gonna go and probably fall asleep.  Bye for now.

      Well, the best part about avoiding Garrett like the plague is freakish amounts of time with Christopher.  Who happens to be the best person ever.  Read his latest blog entry, which would be regarded as one of the sweetest sentiments I've ever read even if it wasn't about me.  It helps that it is though ;).  The boy is just generally dollsome, and I love that I can sit around for hours on end and have these competely pointless converstaions that often turn into riviting discussions on life and love and everything inbetween.  I've never felt like I got in the way of him wanting to be something else (as I often feel with other people with whom I'm friensd.  those named Garrett).  I really do love him dearly, even if it is mostly becuase we can spew pointless converstaion while playing pool for three hours.  We've mostly watched movies and Firefly.  Let me tell you, we didn't make a 'Rollercoaster'esque error in picking out movies again, oh no.  We got ones we kenw for fact were bad.  Like You Got Served, which just about broke my heart by being awful.  Seriously, it was sad.  Grind wasn't as awful as I had hoped, but Adam Brody being adorable made up for it.  Firefly was as wonderful as it could have been, which is pretty damn awsome.  Seriously, watch this show (its cancelled and only one DVD, but so worth the buy).  Joss has found the perfect blend of the old west and new space and he never ceases to amaze me.  I'm working on putting my site online, mostly so I can have a place for my writings, becuase they are burning a hole in my harddrive.  I got some things I have to do, so I'm going to leave now, but I'll have some more to write later.  Much love, Kat

      "I wish my boobs were conversation starters."  Don't we all Sam, don't we all.  Yesterday was really fun.  Rocky, Andrew and I planned to meet up at PV (excuse me while I cry at the loss of Ghetto!Harkins), and ran into Sam and Emily.  We wandered, okay mostly we went into Sam Goody and talked a bunch.  Or we did until Same's boyfriend got fired (not from Sam Goody) and went to go eat.  Then we spent an hour in the food court talking about everything.  We saw The Village and I liked it a lot.  It creeped me out.  Though that could have been mostly me creeping me out, but whatever.  Garrett came, and oh god Emily Bitch, I mean Beach, was a few seats down and kept looking at us.  And Garrett's a moron (but we won't go into all the ways.  especially that last one.  idiot.).  I was so tired today.  A feeling which I demonstrated by sleeping for 4 hours, or it might have been 5 (I'm dead fucking serious too) on the couch.  I was sleepy, I had tennis for the second day in a row and then I had to rush home and shower cause I had my physical.  And my mother wouldn't go home so I could change out of my scrubby clothes, and I had to enter best buy in my yoga shorts and old t-shirt and my hair all blah from the having to put it up while it was still wet.  But its ok I guess, cause I got the latest from Taking Back Sunday (Love it!  Matt harmonizes with Adam on a bunch of the tracks, and I love it!) and the EP/DVD from Fall Out Boy.  I still love them muchly.  Grand Theft Autum/Where Is Your Boy sounds weird acoustic, but still good.  Nobody Puts Baby in the Corner is really cool too.  I can't wait until my mother goes to sleep so I can watch the DVD.    Chris should have been so happy.  I hope he was able to watch Monk.  His life, love, joy, and only hope (Emma Caufield) was on.  I guess he tried calling this morning, but I was out.  I'll try his cell, but I don't even know if he has it.    I gotta run and see Andre 3000 on Bill Mahr, cause we all know pretty soon he's gonna have to go back to his home planet.

      Ahhhh, okay, so everyone needs to go to the  urlLink idobi Radio &nbsp;web site, and not only bask in its gloriousness, but also listen to the Fall Out Boy interview. Yeah, it starts out as mostly the guys talking about penises, but once they start getting actual questions its great.&nbsp; Their commentary on the state of record companies and the music industry to day was really good.&nbsp; And it doesn't hurt that they aren't too fond of our current prez.&nbsp; I love them dearly you know.&nbsp; idobi Radio is my Edge of the internet radio scene *heavy sigh*.&nbsp; They also have interviews from Yellowcard, TBS, New Found Glory&nbsp;and a lot of other really cool bands.&nbsp; If you're into pop!punk/alternative,&nbsp;its so worth a visit, or ten.

      Oh, oh my.&nbsp; I'm so happy you guys.&nbsp; So, the release date of Serenity(the Firefly movie) has been changed.&nbsp; But its all&nbsp; good, becuase its been moved up.&nbsp; The offical is now April 22, 2005.&nbsp; And as my friends I hope you all realize that I will drag you to that movie several times&nbsp;so that it&nbsp;does well in theatres dammit.&nbsp; Oh, its&nbsp;great.&nbsp; Chris&nbsp;will be so happy when he hears this (and if he ever finishes the last episodes dammit).&nbsp; On the offical credits, Wash's real name is "Jerry Lee Warren".&nbsp; *squee*.&nbsp; That's so cute.&nbsp; I'm so excited.  Oh, and I saw Napoleon Dynamite yesterday and it was mondo fabulous.&nbsp; It had not point, seriously, and thats why I loved it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, there was dancing involved.&nbsp; It was really great, and you should all go see it.&nbsp; Car bought me Warped Tour 2004 CD, because I had bought 2002 and 2003, so I didn't just want a burned copy of 2004, and it was like seven bucks, so whatever.&nbsp; And Chris and Car didn't kill each other (though it was pretty close for a while).&nbsp;   Good god, you know what else happened yesterday, I got so bitched out by some old lady.&nbsp; So, I was watering across the street for our neighbor(she's the mother of our old neighbor/friends) because she had hip surgery.&nbsp; I was over there every day, after 6 because the woman said do it early or do it late, because the middle of the day is pointless becuase it'll just dry up.&nbsp;&nbsp;So she accused me of not coming, which was ridiculous, plus Chris had been with me&nbsp;one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me that she would pay me for what I'd done (in a tone that made it sound like I did nothing) and that I didn't need&nbsp;to come back.&nbsp; She gave me $25, and I almost didn't take it, but I was like whatever bitch I'll take your&nbsp;money.&nbsp; Chris offered to bitch-slap her, but I declined,&nbsp;even though the&nbsp;gesture was sweet (it was, cause its Chris, and that's how he offers support, by injuring old people. He's totally getting another grandpa shirt from me.).&nbsp;

      Oh, I'm just putting this one out there for Andrew.&nbsp; I love our guys way&nbsp;better than the British ones.&nbsp; Jai is still my fav, cause he's adorable, and I would kill for some of the tickets he gets those guys.&nbsp; If only I were a straight male (you know, instead of a gay one) and lived in the New York area.&nbsp; *heavy sigh*.&nbsp; Yeah, their culture guy was fugly, and that quite frankly hurts the heart.&nbsp; Their interior decorator wasn't bad looking, but&nbsp; Thom is funny, especially when he gets all&nbsp;Jewish on us.&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the average our guys are way hotter.&nbsp; I mean, come on, we have Kyan with those arms.&nbsp;   Oh, and because I'm totally obsessed, I downloaded like sixteen Bad Religion videos.&nbsp; I love them.&nbsp; Los Angeles Is Burning is great, and Sorrow is still beautiful.&nbsp; Oh, and I've also been listening to massive amounts of Less Than Jake (The Science of Selling Yourself Short is nothing short of genius) and Sugarcult.&nbsp; I totally didn't&nbsp; know that Sugarcult sang Pretty Girl.&nbsp; Its weird, because they're all surfer!punk/alternative and Pretty Girl is kinda hard-edged for them.&nbsp; But whatever cause I love it.&nbsp; But I'm starting to miss my playlist on Lori's comp, cause I haven't burned it yet, so I can't listen to all the acoustic wonderfullness that is Fall Out Boy, or The Who, or Kasey Chambers.&nbsp; But its all good.&nbsp; I even finished most of my story (it was supposed to be a 4-page one-shot, and turned into a complete 20+ page story).&nbsp; I'm proud of me.&nbsp; I'm totally starved, so I'm gonna go eat.&nbsp; Car and I had far too much fun at the grocery store yesterday.&nbsp; We kinda scared our cashier, and that person in the freezer isle.

      Woo Hoo! So, I'm just chillin here at the Hendrickson's.&nbsp; I'm house-sitting while they live it up over at San Francisco.&nbsp; I have a few things to mention regarding Garrett's birthday celebration.&nbsp; Which is fun to talk about really.&nbsp; We went to Buca di Bepo's (which I don't think Chris can say still) and spent most of our time quoting Anchorman.&nbsp; Oh, and&nbsp; there was a picture with a hand that had cat's sleeping around the cuff, so Chris points over there and says, "That hand has a cat problem".&nbsp; And everyone had to go to the bathroom because there was funny stuff plastered all over the walls.&nbsp; Plus, there was a pope table.&nbsp; They even had pope lollipops.&nbsp; I don't think my world is complete without a pope lollipop.&nbsp; My mom made Garrett a boutonniere, which wasn't a corsage, because it was manly, and blue.&nbsp; Chris and I got pictures.&nbsp; But, of couse, what would a day out with the guys without a few incriminating photos of my self, so Chris snapped a shot of me pinning on Garrett's corsage, oops, I mean Boutonniere, and all you can see is the side of his head and my back and Chris plans on plastering it across the internet with the tag line of us kissing.&nbsp; Cause he's retarded, but it is kinda funny.&nbsp; Oh, and he got a pic of Garrett's scared face when he was sure I was gonna stick him with the pin to his corsage, oops, again I mean boutonniere   Christopher came over yesterday and wackiness ensued.&nbsp; We watched a little Firefly, and played a little pool (on separate computers.&nbsp; While in the same room.&nbsp; and talking to each other online).&nbsp; We're probably going to see Napoleon Dynamite today or tomorrow, and everyone reading this has an open invitation.&nbsp; Talked to Emily a little yesterday (sorry for not calling back by the way, Chris&nbsp;and I had to chase the wind and other such nonsense), which was fun cause she's great.&nbsp; And she's a unicorn and wood nymph.&nbsp; Yay for Emily.   Dude, Car is so awesome, she took me to Best Buy and was like pick whatever DVD or CD you want.&nbsp; It was her gift to me for getting a 5 on my psych test.&nbsp; She's always doing awesome stuff like that for me.&nbsp; For my first tennis match, she bought me Angel Season 1.&nbsp; I love my sister, she's crazy awesome.&nbsp; Oh, and I&nbsp; got Fall Out Boy's Take This To Your Grave.&nbsp; It's pretty good.&nbsp; On a scale from 1 to Dido (tm Christopher) it probably ranks lower than Coheed, and around Yellowcard.&nbsp; I really like the beat, and there are some fun songs.&nbsp; Its kinda weird how I go from the war anthems of Coheed to the songs about your best friend from Fall Out Boy.&nbsp; Oh, and I still need, need, need to buy their acoustic EP, becuase I already have downloaded 3 of the six songs on the disc, but I need the DVD portion as well.&nbsp; They're quite fabulous.  Yesterday was great.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; It was funny as hell.&nbsp; So, Chris and I show up at the house, and we're all intent to go right in and start our amazing day of doing nothing productive.&nbsp; Except we can't get in the house.&nbsp; because the lock hates me.&nbsp; Seriously, Garrett had told me the lock was difficult, but I figure I'm not a complete moron, so I figure I can figure out the damn lock.&nbsp; I was wrong by the way.&nbsp; Cause it was not working.&nbsp; Chris and I broke into the back yard, but all the windows were shut and the door was locked.&nbsp; He finally got the lock worked out after like half an hour of us freaking out that Lady's gonna starve and we're gonna break the key in the lock.&nbsp; It was inspired.   Garrett is completely adorable (and I brought 4&1 over).&nbsp; He left me notes all around his bedroom.&nbsp; Like, on Buffy Season 3, it said take me home and bring back 4&1 (which I totally did cause I'm awesome).&nbsp; The chair says sit on me (except the seat says Get Off) and the bamboo says water me.&nbsp; Oh, and I love him dearly, he    double-cased    his pillows!&nbsp; So if I choose to sleep in his room (which I might because their couches are less than comfy for several nights in a row) I won't have any exposed pillow problems.&nbsp; There aren't many guys who would double case&nbsp;pillow for you, no siree.&nbsp; Is he not just a total doll?&nbsp; I wish he were here, cause we could use his brand of funny.&nbsp;   So, last night, Chris and I decided to go matrix dancing in the wind.&nbsp; It was so funny, there was this car driving by and it slowed and looked at us like we were in-sane.&nbsp; Which would make sense cause we're out there spinning around.&nbsp; Then there was this Styrofoam box floating down the street so we had to run and get it.&nbsp; Car also thinks we're crazy by the way.   Oh, I had another one of those moments when I feel like Cristopher's mother.&nbsp; We were gearing up to make dinner, and Car and I decide on Mac & Cheese, cause its great, but all Chris wants to eat is mashed potatoes.&nbsp; I had to spend a&nbsp;good five minutes convincing him that mashed potatoes is not a meal.&nbsp; And the Hendrickson's house is really bright in the morning.&nbsp; Which is good, cause that probably means I won't be sleeping in till noon, but not good because its early and I just want to roll over and not have sun in my face.&nbsp; But whatever, its still fun wandering around here.   Oh, here are some really interesting things said yesterday.   Me: You suck.  Chris: You suck better.   Car: Where's Chris, I know he's here.  Me: Oh, he's here, but he's a boy so he's not allowed to be.  Car: He's not allowed to be a boy?   Chris(on Jill Hennesy on Law & Order): She died.  Car: What are you talking about.  Chris: There was a car crash.&nbsp; Jack McCoy was drunk.    Later     Chris(on Munch's original partner): She's not on the show anymore.&nbsp; Her character was suicidal.    Car: Chris, she got transferred to another unit.   Me: Oh, was Jack McCoy drunk.   Me: I love you too.  Chris: Not here!   Chris: heehee I googled poop.   Chris: Kat's a girl's name.   Car: Were you making out with Chris again?  Me: What?&nbsp; No!  Car: Cause your shirt's on backwards.&nbsp; *it was too.&nbsp; it had been all day, and I hadn't noticed*

      Holy Shit!  Oh, my god, you guys are not going to believe what happened  yesterday.  You won't.  I'm serious.  I was just chillin at Lori's computer, talking with Christopher and playing solitaire, listening to obscene amounts of Coheed & Cambria again, when Car hands me my mail.  This letter, from AP Testing.  Regarding my Psychology exam.  And do you know what I got?  Oh, thats right, I got a 5.  F-I-V-E!  I was so happy, and Christopher was  happy too, and it was one big ball of joy.  Dude, I was so surprised, because I did not think I did that well.  Gah, its so exciting.  My mom's gonna take me out for ice cream later today (I gotta remember to invite Christopher, cause Garrett's working).  Oh, and this really only pertains to Christopher, I was watching Queer Eye for the Straight Guy last night, and it was the UK version.  The guy's wife was jiving with the queer boys, and they were talking about her later, and do you know what phrase they used.  Yes.  It was.  I know.  We aren't the only ones who express our great like of someone through the phrase 'kindred spirits'.  We're so awsome.  Hugs & Kisses you guys, Kat

      I'm back.  Okay, so I've been back for two days now, but I was terribly sick.  I skipped tennis even, and I love tennis, if not just for the fact that I actually have a forehand now.  I'm better, kinda, okay, I'm well enough to go out with the guy's tonight at least.  I'm coughing a lot, but at least I'm not sneezing all the time.  We will now commence with my wonderful adventures in D.C.  They're kinda jumbled in my head at the moment, but we'll just try to hit the key points, even if they're not in order.  The Library of Congress was amazing, so beautiful.  I actually sputtered out some fangirl when I saw the main reading room.  You have no idea, its beautiful, and there are just so many books.  I like books, okay.  My new favorite quote is Carolyn's  reaction to my reaction.  I'm standing there, gazing lovingly at the room, and she's just like "Good god, you should just get married here."  I had mom buy me a postcard, and I'm gonna type out Car's quote and stick it on there.  I can hang it in my locker next to my favorite photos.  Lori got sick right at the beginning of the trip.  She missed out on the day of the fourth.  Which was really quite interesting, let me tell you.  We decided to go Smithsonian hopping, mostly so Car could wear her great new skirt.  Because a skirt that nice with tennis shoes would be so wrong, and she made me wear my skirt too.  Well, there was a light drizzle when we started out the day, it was nice really, better than being humid really.  We wandered around Natural History, which had an exhibit on baseball, which doesn't make all that much sense, but Car got some Yankees stuff.  When we were done though, it was pouring, insanely pouring.  I, of course, had on my newest shirt from AE, which thank god was already see-through because I had my black tank underneath it.  It would have doubly sucked if I got stuck in the rain in flip-flops, a skirt and a white shirt.  It was pretty funny though, becuase we had to go in search of the nearest metro stop, which involved crossing the street.  Crossing the street, you might say, thats not hard.  No, not usually, when you have on the afore mentioned flip-flops trying to get past water settling above your ankes, its a different story.  We managed, barely, Car lost both her shoes, and I lost one, and then we were saved by a cabby who brought us back to the hotel.  Oh, but the 4th of July fun was not over.  After going back to our hotel (which I will go into more detail about later, because it was adorable) and chillin for a bit, mom convinces us that we NEED to go to the capitol lawn.  Now, I loved the last time we were there as much as the next girl really,  but this year not only was the lawn going to be soggy, but Clay Aiken was playing.  Have you seen his hands?  They're creepy, and he's creepy, and sooooo not attractive. Did I mention how creepy his hands are?  But, whatever, we go out. Its drizzling agian, but, as I'm sure you've all guessed, it does not stay that way, no.  No, it starts full on pouring.  Again!  We tried to stay, we did, but it was so miserable.  And Lori kept on complaining becuase water was pouring down the back of her pants, but Car and I didn't tell her that the way she was holding her umbrella was dripping it down. It was pretty funny.  So, we decided in the end to trek it back to the hotel, which was so much nicer.  Car and I hung out in our bed and watched Independance Day in our bath robes, Lori slept cause she was still sickly, and mom watched the fireworks from our window.  And I escaped having to see/hear Clay Aiken.  Yoo Hoo!  *I get all libral in this paragraph, so if you're gonna get all offended, don't read it.  Oh, and I don't want debate, so don't comment on it if it pisses you off.* I got to see a taping of Crossfire.  It was really cool.  Tucker Carlson got his ass handed to him.  It was inspired.  He was dissing all the forerunners for Kerry's VP, saying that if he was a real democrat he would have some diversity, other than only rich white males.  Paul Begala replies that the republicans idea of diversity is two guys from different oil companies.  It was an Oh, Snap moment, you should have been there.  It made me really sad that I couldn't see James Carville, because I love him.  Seriously, have you ever seen the man debate, they sure don't call him the Ragin' Cajun' for nothing.  Car and I had a good laugh at Tucker, on the basis of his name and that stupid bowtie he insists on wearing all the time.  I was kinda  glad Bob Novak wasn't there, because I kinda love him too, and it would have been akward if my mother saw me clapping at the conversative notions.  She wouldn't be mad, just really weirded out.  Hell, it kinda weirds me out too.  Ok, done with that, now onto the next portion of our tour.  Which actually wont' be that long, cause I'm gonna have to go soon.  Um, oh, I got hit on by this cute greek boy.  Not, I would carry on a sordid affair with him cute, but I can appreciate adorableness as much as the next girl cute.  I was sittign in this place that he worked at, eating with Car until she had to get up real quick, and so he sits down.  I don't know if thats ever happened to you, but its weird, cause some guy just sits there.  I looked confused for several moments until I was informed, and I swear to god this is what he said, "Pretty girls should never eat alone."  I could have died, I was beat red and had to supress giggles, becuase it was so outlandish.  But he had really dark hair, and really dark eyes, and this adorable accent.  It was really funny.  I'm off right now, but there's still more to tell.  I was there for a week dammit, I did a lot of stuff.  Okay, some of that stuff was reading four books, and memorizing the entire Coheed & Cambria CD, but that was important too.  Love you guys, and I'm so glad to be back, Kat

      Ok, I'm really leaving this time, and this will be my last post for at least a week*Chris'll go crazy*.  I'm gonna miss everybody, especialy Garrett becaue I'm already missing our favorite work-a-holic.  This is about Chris actually, because he's been so good to me(you most likely won't care about this if you aren't Chris, just so you know).  There are a thousand words I could write in these spaces, and none of them would grasp *us* as much as this one: kismet *biggest damn smile I can give you right now*.  We're an idea, this whole string of thoughts that can be summed up so simply.  Becuase we're us and we don't need to be anything else.  There are no acts to put on each others presence, no facades, nothing.  You can come to my house and fall asleep and its fine, because we all know that I'll be asleep in yours in less than a week.  You understand all of my musical obsessions.  You don't like them all, but you understand.  More times than I can count have we screamed "Kindred Spirits" in public places because we are.  You have my train of thought, and you steal my lines, and you say them funnier than I would have, and that's ok.  You've made this summer one to remember.  We saw, or talked, or both to one another a good month into it before we went on a week hiatus.  Then we jumped right back on the horse.  You understand each and every contrasting emotion that I have, and you don't even know why the hell they're happening most of the time.  But you don't need, and could quite possibly be your most endearing quality.  But you have so many, so its hard to pick.  You mean so much to me, so much, and I hope you read this whenever you miss me over the next week, which will be really long for us.  When I get back, we can knock out the rest of Firefly, and we'll watch Rollercoast again and cry together, and we can eat Taco Bell, because we're like that.  And we have more than one week together!  I guess I'm trying to say that I love you dearly.  Becaue I do, really truly honestly, I love you so much it makes me dizzy.  You're my sister (you know you love to hear it), you're my second soul/kindred spirit, and you are one of the best people I've had the joy of meeting.  Even though you have a strange tendency to ignore people talking to you (which is cute sometimes, until I have to fix what you started), I would gladly go anywhere with you.  Who else will spend hours upon hours with me in music or video stores just looking at things and commenting on their awsomeness, or potential awsomeness?  Seriously?  Other people would tire of me quickly, but you stick it out for obscene amounts of time.  You make bad movies better, and you keep me sane by driving me crazy.   I love the multitude of ridiculous things I can say in your presence, and the things you say back.    I'm gonna miss you so much while I'm gone.  But I'll learn things just for you, and I'll take pictures and I'll give you presents, mints even if I'm feeling kind.  I'll be back soon enough, and I promise not to forget.  Always, Kat

      Ok, this is for you Andrew, because I did not mean to confuse.  Though, you have some very interesting thoughts on what exactly this mysterious Fireflying(take note of the capitol, take not dammit!) might be, none of them are right (this is a great story I just made up because I'm kinda bored and avoiding doing other things, if you don't care, just skip to the second paragraph).  Let us go back to the beginning.  In this beginning, there is a girl who once dated a boy who loved a show.  This girl watched this show once and was enamored with a certain werewolf on the show.  She continued to watch this show, until, alas, it became an obsession.  This obsession was furthered by a wonderous thing called The Internet.  This Internet allowed her to explore the world of this show far beyond her television screen.  A wonderous being created this show, and several others(okay, one, and then two) like it.  She feared this Joss creature, but she was intrigued nonetheless, so when he presented a doomed look at the future, she readily took it.  He called this masterpiece Firefly(now its a noun)  It was doomed because the evils of Fox Network would never allow a brilliantly acted and written work such as this to succeed.  But all hope was not lost, because the amazing Joss put his creation on magical disks, hereby to be known as DVDs.  When one engages in watching these "DVDs" if you will, they Firefly (now a verb).  While we were watching them, we were Fireflying, we watched them yesterday, so we Fireflied.  Such are the wonders of the world.  The show is called Firefly(a noun here), so whenever we watch it, we Firefly (now its a verb).  Rocky hopes to one day Firefly (still a verb), you should come too.  Oh, but I suppose Fireflying is the verb we use when we plan on having obscene amounts of sex too.  I need to find a new secret code *makes mental note to tell Christopher*.  And if you read my post, that explination of Fireflying just makes all of us look bad.  Hugs and Kisses honey, Kat
