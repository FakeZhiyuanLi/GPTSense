      LOVE YOUR JOB, BUT NEVER FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN COMPANY STOPS LOVING YOU... Narayana Murthy  I know people who work 12 hours a day, six days a week, or more. Some people do so because of a work emergency where the long hours are only temporary. Other people I know have put these hours for years. I don't know if they are working all these hours, but I do know they are in the office this long. Others put in long office hours because they are addicted to the workplace. Whatever the reason for putting in overtime, working long hours over the long term is harmful to the person and to the organization. There are things managers can do to change this for everyone's benefit. Being in the office long hours, over long periods of time, makes way for potential errors. My colleagues who are in the office long hours frequently make mistakes caused by fatigue.  Correcting these mistakes requires their time as well as the time and energy of others. I have seen people work Tuesday through Friday to correct mistakes made after 5 PM on Monday. Another problem is that people who are in the office long hours are not pleasant company. They often complain about other people (who aren't working as hard); they are irritable, or cranky, or even angry. Other people avoid them. Such behavior poses problems, where work goes much better when people work together instead of avoiding one another. As Managers, there are things we can do to help people leave the office. First and foremost is to set the example and go home ourselves on time. I work with a manager who chides people for working long hours. His words quickly lose their meaning when he sends these chiding groups e-mails with a time-stamp of 2 AM, Sunday. Second is to encourage people to put some balance in their lives.   For instance, here is a guideline I find helpful:  1) Wake up, eat a good breakfast, and go to work. 2) Work hard and smart for eight or nine hours. 3) Go home. 4) Read the comics, watch a funny movie, dig in the dirt, play with your kids, etc 5) Eat well and sleep well. This is called recreating. Doing steps 1, 3, 4, and 5 enable step 2. Working regular hours and recreating daily are simple concepts.  They are hard for some of us because that requires personal change. They are possible since we all have the power to choose to do them. In considering the issue of overtime, I am reminded of my eldest son. When he was a toddler, if people were visiting the apartment, he would not fall asleep, no matter how long the visit, and no matter what time of day it was. He would fight off sleep until the visitors left. It was as if he was afraid that he would miss something. Once our visitors' left, he would go to sleep. By this time, however, he was over tired and would scream through half the night with nightmares. He, my wife, and I, all paid the price for his fear of missing out. Perhaps some people put in such long hours because they don't want to miss anything when they leave the office. The trouble with this is that events will never stop happening. That is life!! Things happen 24 hours a day. Allowing for little rest is not ultimately practical. So, take a nap. Things will happen while you're asleep, but you will have the energy to catch up when you wake.   Hence "LOVE YOUR JOB BUT NEVER FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR COMPANY" Have a great day ahead!! Regards.

      SUDHA MURTHY, AUTHOR AND WIFE OF INFOSYS CHAIRMAN NARAYANA MURTHY, TELLS THE STORY OF HOW INFOSYS WAS BORN AND HOW HER LIFE HAS CHANGED... YET REMAINED VERY MUCH THE SAME  I was in Pune that I met Narayana Murthy through my friend Prasanna, who is now the Wipro chief, who was also training in Telco. Murthy was shy, bespectacled and an introvert. When he invited us for dinner, I was a bit taken aback... I refused since I was the only girl in the group. But Murthy was relentless and we all decided to meet for dinner the next day at 7.30 pm at Green Fields Hotel on Pune's Main Road. The next day, I went there at seven since I had to go to the tailor near the hotel. And what do I see? Mr Murthy waiting in front of the hotel and it was only seven. Till today, Murthy maintains that I had mentioned (consciously!) that I would be going to the tailor at seven, so that I could meet him... And I maintain that I did not say any such thing, consciously or subconsciously, because I did not think of Murthy as anything other than a friend at that stage. We have agreed to disagree on this matter. Soon, we became friends. Our conversations were filled with Murthy's experiences abroad and the books that he had read. My friends insisted that Murthy was trying to impress me because he was interested in me. I kept denying it till one day, after dinner, Murthy said, I want to tell you something. I knew this was it. It was coming. He said, I am 5'4" tall. I come from a lower middleclass family. I can never become rich. You are beautiful, bright, intelligent and you can get anyone you want. But will you marry me?  I asked him to give me some time...  When I went to Hubli, I told my parents about Murthy and his proposal. My mother was positive since Murthy was also from Karnataka, seemed intelligent and came from a good family. But my father asked: What's his job, his salary, his qualifications, etc? Murthy was working as a research assistant and earning less than me. He was willing to go Dutch with me on our outings.  My parents agreed to meet him in Pune on a particular day at 10 am sharp. Murthy did not turn up. How can I trust a man to take care of my daughter if he cannot keep an appointment, asked my father. At 12 noon, Murthy turned up in a bright red shirt! He had gone on work to Bombay, got stuck in a traffic jam in the ghats, so he hired a taxi (though it was very expensive for him) to meet his would-be father-in-law. Father was unimpressed. He asked Murthy what he wanted to become in life. Murthy said he wanted to become a politician in the Communist Party and wanted to open an orphanage. My father gave his verdict. No. I don't want my daughter to marry somebody who wants to become a communist and then open an orphanage when he himself doesn't have money to support his family...  By this time, I realised I had developed a liking towards Murthy, which could only be termed as love. I wanted to marry him because he was an honest man. I promised my father that I would not marry Murthy without his blessings, though at the same time, I would not marry anybody else. My father said he would agree if Murthy promised to take up a steady job. But Murthy refused, saying he would not do things in life because somebody wanted him to. I was caught between the two most important people in my life. The stalemate continued for three years, during which our courtship took us to every restaurant and cinema hall in Pune. Murthy was always broke. (Ironically, today, he manages Infosys Technologies Ltd, one of the world's most reputed companies.) He always owed me money. We used to go for dinner and he would say, I don t have money with me, you pay my share, will return it to you later. For three years, I maintained a book of Murthy's debts to me. No, he never returned the money and I finally tore it up after our wedding. The amount was a little over Rs 4,000. During this period, Murthy quit his job as a research assistant and started his own software business... Towards the late'70s computers were entering India in a big way. At the fag end of 1977, Murthy decided to take up a job as General Manager at Patni Computers in Bombay. But before he joined the company, he wanted to marry me since he was to go on training to the US after, joining. My father gave in as he was happy Murthy had a decent job, now. We were married in Murthy's house in Bangalore on February 10, 1978, with only our two families present. I got my first silk sari. The wedding expenses came to only Rs 800, with Murthy and I pooling in Rs 400 each. I went to the US with Murthy after marriage. He encouraged me to see America on my own, because I loved travelling. I toured America for three months with a backpack. In 1981, Murthy wanted to start Infosys. Initially, I was very apprehensive about him getting into business. We were living a comfortable life in Bombay with a regular paycheck and I didn't want to rock the boat. But Murthy was passionate about creating good quality software. I decided to support him. Typically for Murthy, he had a dream and no money. So I gave him Rs 10,000 which I had saved for a rainy day without his knowledge and told him, this is all I have. Take it. I will take care of the financial needs of our house. You go and chase your dreams. But you have only three years! Murthy and his six colleagues started Infosys in 1981. In 1982, I left Telco and moved to Pune with Murthy. We bought a small house on loan, which also became the Infosys office. I was a clerk-cum-cook-cumprogrammer. I also took up a job as Senior Systems Analyst with the Walchand group of Industries to support the house. In'83, Infosys got their first client, MICO, in Bangalore. Murthy moved to Bangalore and stayed with his mother, while I went to Hubli to deliver my second child, Rohan. Ten days after my son was born, Murthy left for the US on project work. I saw him only after a year - my son had infantile eczema. It was only after Rohan received all his vaccinations that I came to Bangalore where we rented a small house in Jayanagar and rented another house as Infosys headquarters. Nandan Nilekani and his wife Rohini stayed with us. While Rohini babysat my son, I wrote programmes for Infosys. There was no car, no phone, just two kids and a bunch of us working hard, juggling our lives and having fun while Infosys was taking shape. The wives of other partners too, gave their unstinting support. We all knew that our men were trying to build something good.  Murthy made it very clear that it would either be me or him working at Infosys. Never the two of us together. He did not want a husband and wife team at Infosys. I was shocked since I had the relevant experience and technical qualifications. He said, Sudha if you want to work with Infosys, I will withdraw, happily I was pained to know that I would not be involved in the company my husband was building and that I would have to give up a job that I was qualified to do and loved doing... Then, I realised that to make Infosys a success, one had to give 100 per cent. One had to be focused on it alone, with no other distractions. If the two of us had to give 100 per cent to Infosys, what would happen to our home and our children? I opted to be a homemaker; after all, Infosys was Murthy's dream. It was a big sacrifice, but it was one that had to be made. Even today, Murthy says, Sudha, I stepped on your career to make mine. You are responsible for my success.  I might have given up my career for my husband's sake, but that does not make me a doormat... Isn't freedom about living your life the way you want it? What is right for one person might be wrong for another. It is up to the individual to make a choice that is effective in her life. I believe that when a woman gives up her right to choose for herself, that is when she crosses over from being an individual to a doormat.  Murthy's dreams encompassed not only himself, but a generation of people. It was about creating something worthy, exemplary and honourable. It was about creation and distribution of wealth. His dreams were grander than my career plans, in all aspects. So, when I had to choose between Murthy's career and mine, I opted for what I thought was the right choice. We had a home and two little children. Somebody had to take care of it all. Somebody had to stay behind to create a home base that would be fertile for healthy growth, happiness, and more dreams to dream. I became that somebody willingly I can confidently say that if I had had a dream like Infosys, Murthy would have given me his unstinted support. The roles would have been reversed. We are not bound by the archaic rules of marriage. He does not intrude into my time, especially when I am writing my novels. He does not interfere in my work at the Infosys Foundation and I don't interfere with the running of Infosys. I teach computer science to MBA and MCA students at Christ College for a few hours every week and I earn around Rs 50,000 a year. I value this financial independence greatly, though there is no need for me to pursue a career. Murthy respects that. I travel the world without him, because he hates travelling. We trust each other implicitly. We have another understanding too. While he earns the money, I spend it mostly through charity. The Infosys Foundation was born in 1997 with the sole objective of uplifting the less-privileged sections of society. In the past three years, we have built hospitals, orphanages, rehabilitation centres, school buildings, science centres and more than 3,500 libraries. Our work is mainly in the rural areas amongst women and children. I am one of the trustees of the Foundation, and our activities span six states. I travel to around 800 villages constantly. Every year, we donate around Rs 5-6 crores. We run Infosys Foundation the way Murthy runs Infosys - in a professional and scientific way. Philanthropy is a profession and an art. It can be used or misused. Every year, we receive more than 10,000 applications for donations. Every day, I receive more than 120 calls. Amongst these, there are those who genuinely need help and there are hoodwinkers too. Over the years, I have learnt to differentiate the wheat from the chaff, though I still give all the cases a patient hearing. Sometimes, I feel I have lost the ability to trust people. I have become shrewder to avoid being conned. I think that is the price that I have to pay for the position I am in now. The greatest difficulty in having money is to teach your children its value... Bringing up children in a moneyed atmosphere is a difficult task. Even today, I think twice if I have to spend Rs 10 on an auto when I can walk to my house. I cannot expect my children to do the same. They have seen money from the time they were born. But we can lead by example. When they see Murthy wash his own plate after eating and clean the two toilets in the house every day, they realise that no work is demeaning, irrespective of how rich you are. This doesn't mean we expect our children to live an austere life. My children buy what they want, go where they want, but they have to follow certain rules. They have to show me bills for whatever they buy: My daughter can buy five new outfits, but she has to give away five old ones. My son can go out with his friends for lunch or dinner, but we discourage him from going to a five star hotel. Or we accompany him. My children haven't given me any heartbreak. My daughter is studying abroad, my son in Bangalore. They don t use their father's name in vain. They only say that his name is Murthy and that he works for Infosys. They don't want to be recognised and appreciated because of their father or me, but for themselves.  I don't feel guilty about having money, for we have worked hard for it. But I don't feel comfortable flaunting it. It is a conscious decision on our part to live a simple, so-called middle class life. We live in the same two-bedroom, sparsely furnished house we lived in before Infosys became a success. Our only extravagance is buying books and CDs. My house has no lockers for I have no jewels. I wear a pair of stone earrings which I bought in Bombay for Rs 100. I don, t even wear my `mangalsutra` unless I need to attend some family functions or when I am with my mother-in-law. Five years ago, I went to Kashi, where tradition demands that you give something up. I gave up shopping. Since then, I haveri t bought myself a sari or gone shopping. I don't carry a purse and neither does Murthy, most of the time. I borrow money from my secretary or my driver if I need cash. They know my habit, so they always carry extra cash with them. But I settle the accounts every evening. Murthy and I are very comfortable with our lifestyle and we don't see the need to change it now that we have money:  Murthy and I are two opposites that complement each other. Murthy is sensitive and romantic in his own way. He always gifts me books addressed 'From Me to You. Or'To the person I most admire, etc. We both love books. I am an extrovert and he is an introvert. I love watching movies and listening to classical music. Murthy loves listening to English classical music. I go out for movies with my students and secretary every other week. I am still young at heart. I really enjoyed watching'Kaho Na Pyaar Hai'; I am a Hrithik Roshan fan. It has been more than 20 years since Murthy and I went for a movie. My daughter once gave us a surprise by booking tickets for'Titanic'. Since I had a prior engagement that day, Murthy went for the movie with his secretary Pandu. I love travelling, whereas Murthy loves spending time at home. Friends come and go with the share prices. Even in my dreams, I did not expect Infosys to grow the way it has. After Infosys went public in 1993, we became what people would call rich, moneyed people. Suddenly, you see and hear about so much money: People talk about you. It was all new to me.  Have I lost my identity as a woman, in Murthy's shadow? No, I might be Mrs Narayana Murthy. I might be Akshata and Rohan's mother. I might be the trustee of Infosys Foundation. But I am still Sudha. Like all women, I play different roles. That doesn't mean we don't have our own identity. Women have that extra quality of adaptability and learn to fit into different shoes. But we are our own selves still. And we have to exact our freedom by making the right choices in our lives, dictated by us and not by the world.

      You are beautiful. . .  It's a phrase that my mother uses a lot.  I used to wonder, "How in the world can Mother call them beautiful?"  I am a logical, statistical person. I call things as I see them. I didn't see beauty.  My mother would tell people this with an enthusiasm they could feel.  She was genuine.  She wasn't telling them they were beautiful to get something from them.  Most of the time, they were trying to get something from her.  I wondered for years what was wrong with Mother's perception and vision.  Couldn't she see that all of the people she called beautiful, weren't beautiful?  You were beautiful only if you had a certain figure and face that was classed as beautiful by the laws of the world and glamour.  Yet when my mother spoke, people smiled as though Glamour magazine had listed them as one of the beautiful people of the year.  It took me years to finally understand my mother's vision and the phrase, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."  My mother had a spirit that could see the beauty in a person.  Most only look on the outside and then compare what they see with the standards the world has given them.  That was what I was doing.  Today when you leave your house, carefully look at the first person whom you see and notice how beautiful they are.  They may be balding, fat, wrinkled, pimply, or any of the other things the world frowns upon as beauty.  Look at them closely and look for the beauty.  If you really look, you'll see it.  I didn't believe that at first until I tried it. Sure enough, as I stared and opened another set of eyes, I was able to see the beauty in every person. No matter how rough or worn a person looked, each pain etched line held a glimpse of beauty.  You just had to look for the beauty.  It's there.  When you leave your home this morning, look hard at each person.  You will start to see the beauty of every human who you didn't know existed.  Trust me and try this. If you sincerely look, you will see it.  When you get home after seeing the beauty in faces you see, look in the mirror.  You are beautiful.  Thank you mama for all of the beauty that you have not only seen, but added.                                  by,                       sudhamalladi

      12:21:24 AM                 04-Jan-03  I will not advice u to follow your heart always because heart follows your habits and the way you think. If you are lazy then your heart doesn’t allow you to work hard.  So keep a check on what your heart says. Keep some moral lines in you. They will shape your character. Be busy all the time, if you are off for a sec, you are off for a long. Don’t postpone the things. Don’t stop or delay for others convenience, the things which you wanted to do. Be high on morale and your level of thinking.  Try to understand what others say and be a pathetic listener. Try to think from all corners but don’t change your view on it, or else it mean you don’t have individuality.  Try to portray yourself as how you are to the world and let them like you. Don’t give false impressions, as you are not that you won’t be able to keep that image for a long. You will regret when "you" come front of your false the world will hate you. Don’t get moody every moment for bit things. Try to be cheerful and enthusiastic to face the bad. Be inspired always. Never be proud of what you are, but make your parents feel that. Hate doesn't kill hate; love does so, atleast try not to hate. Remember one thing "proud swallows up a man completely".  But here I would like to distinguish self-respect to proud. Self respect is believing what you are, proud is feeling great for what you are. Don’t feel you are great rather take the positive side and build confidence and improve your talents. Always favour critics than acclaims. Your critics are your best well wishers you can ever have. Often it is considered by us that critics are beings to ignore and they wont encourage but if you are perfect timer having enough grasping power you can see that they are challenging you in the way they are inspiring, patting to prove what you want to.   I advice you to talk to yourself daily for 5 minutes before going to bed that is the last moment of the day, and recollect all the things you have done and compare what you wanted to do and think how would you have handled and dealt in the next best way and look for improvisation. If you dint do what you thought or you regret the day realise what went wrong and how did that happen. Go to deep roots of cause and make a point to look that it won’t happen again.  Here you need determination and will power. This exercise will improve you a lot and help build your personality and character. Don’t forget your dreams and don’t ever-loose tempo and motive to get the dreams. Make them, Chase them, trace them, get them and take them in the right place.                            By.  Malladi sudha.

         Recently I received a call from my fellow student . while on the conversation he raised a very interesting topic  and he asked me to think on something called loneliness and how to overcome it. So I was thinking  a little while ago,……..   “ever a person in the world alone?” I was  in fact asked to  analyze and give some points on this topic  I got some chores in my mind which kept me busy for a while and I immersed into a deep think tank. After a long reciprocal queries and answers to my self I got the basic question as why does a man live?  I will make it more clear for u .The question I raised to myself is what is that which makes a man live?       The answer I got immediately after that was “hope”.   Yes, hope……. if that doesn’t exist within a man he probably be died  and no more are the questions from persons like me  ever a person in the world alone?  If a person is alive implies he has hope of some positive energy. That ray of hope actually nurtures a man to aspire, become and achieve something which if got stronger becomes his willpower .  But this basic question dint serve my purpose of thinking. So I slid to another angle when does a man feel  lonely?   After some thinking I got  some points to ponder. A man is alone right from his birth. There is no minute in his life where he is not alone. But he doesn’t realize  in the same way  as we don’t see stars in the day light, thus we forget that we are actually alone in this world. We get busy with family, friends, life partners and then back to family consisting kids. So….. we never get time to realize our loneliness . but vital thing here is “WHAT ….when it gets dark …. Then we know how many stars actually glue…..”       so, in the similar fashion we feel we are alone when something  gets dark in our life . dark can come in any color, when something which is habituated, addicted or taken for granted that whatever changes may it be but this thing will not change, then you are drowning in to dark to find the stars.   But a man will not adapt to the dynamic changes around him , he  doesn’t wants to get used to change, but he wont see he has another day light to focus on…. which changes  the dimension of hope but unfortunately it changes after sometime . If hope changes immediately after getting dark then probably never will a person realize that he is alone all these days.   I’ll ask  you something………….. by your adorable approval.  I think u nodded already so here I go…."Have u ever faced any situation where u need something desperately and you are not able to find it  and after a long search u find that is actually beside u? ………… and I also know u perhaps smiled for your foolishness after finding it.                                   So here u know what u need ? u know how it is ? where it is? But, u cant specifically say where can u get that now. In the same way “we know what we want but, we find them only when we have to find them.  when time favors u will find an unknown treasure but if the reverse happens u wont be able to find what u want even it’s  in front of u.     So, time strikes the trigger  and when it does  things get changed dramatically.  And after a point of time we realize we cant change or control what have happened and what’s happening.         So, once u have accepted the factors that are unchangeable, just about everything else in your life can be tailored  to suit you better. Hard  to believe, but it’s true. To decide what you want to rearrange, you first have to know your options. There’s usually no such things as an absolutely right or wrong decisions . If you select one course, you’ll never know for certain what could have happened if you’d  chosen differently, so don’t prosecute yourself  with what might have been? . everything has advantages and disadvantages, and making a choice means giving something up . there’s always a price to pay, though it may be small compared with the bonuses.    The advantage of being indecisive is that you never have to give up anything you’ve got at that point, and there’s always the possibilities held in dreams. But if you’re not in control and are not being decisive, it leaves the door wide open  for someone else to make decisions for u , or for circumstances to overtake you. You may  not be so happy with that, but you can always fantasize  that you might have been more successful , happier , had more direction, if only the opportunity had presented itself. So I posed two angles of perception, ….. the advantage of being decisive and indecisive.                                        To make these fantasies , you have to make choices……………        To make choices u need to know the problem and if your problem is your loneliness , you are very fortunate enough that u got time to think.   What is making you feel that? What are the things changed which led to feel alone. What was it before and what is now? What is changeable in it and what is not. What is paining you and what are u happy about?  Think about every possibility or option even if u think they are outrageous and silly ,  who  knows they may prove  to be the bunch of  choices which sparkles  your life with a small ray of hope…………………………..                              Hope…… which may again lead to better willpower, strength, determination , optimistic attitude so that u never feel pensive and lonely…..                                                                                                                          By….

         5/24/03 4:28:02 AM                            I was at my friend’s house one day, with a bunch of friends. While we were discussing, Someone asked me “what makes a man successful?”  Immediately a friend from behind raised “whether Iam at any point of time successful?” Another pointed to me saying “ even if u r successful at old times u r not successful right now so, as the times change u r old to success and with rapid change in global scenario and with advanced environments u may not be able to tell what makes a man successful in these times.”                     I gave a smile……………………………. Said I know a story where a father who was a martial arts champion once in his time is deceived by time became disabled by paralysis attack. His left hand and leg were not working. It happened when he thought of training his own son .the moment he thought he is paralysed he was depressed and could not digest that he couldn’t teach his son. He one day thought that he is deceived by his body alright but his mind and heart is not paralysed. He was very determined to teach martial arts to his son. When he told his decision to his family his wife bluntly shouted not to take any risk with his life. But he dint listen to any one. He started his lessons one fine morning and after 3 yrs of rigorous practice his son won a medal in martial arts for his father. After months however his father passed away.                             I was calm after finishing this, waiting for their reaction. After a while I again started saying " friends, here the determination made the father to overcome his disability but this is not his sole success but his sons. What if his son is not interested in martial arts and wanted to do something else?  And in case even if he is forced to accept his dad's wish, he has to give his 100% to the art to be a master. So here success is dads and sons. So even if someone wants to show u the way to success one must be ready to journey that way".                      I dint finish my talk; a person asked me what is the key to be successful. I said I dint finish answering my friend’s question that when u r not successful u can’t tell "how to become". For that I will tell u a live story of my professor for chartered accountancy when I was doing foundation course. I discontinued it when I finished my course that's anyway other thing. He was not a practicing C.A he finished his m.com. But he made many C.A's in his career. So here an M.COM graduate made chartered accountants. Keep in mind that he never attempted to write c.a. exams. So, by this it is clear that one must not be necessarily be successful to make a man. Shall I say complete Man. successful man to say?                             Now as I finished, I glanced at my friends who raised questions. They look convinced. Suddenly a voice pitched up sounding, "then what are the essentials to become successful? " .I turned where sound hailed from. He is the same person who asked me earlier. I said “what u have right now is most important”. He stared at me expressing what I mean? I replied before he asks the same in a louder voice "anxiety" "enthusiasm" and "patience" u showed when I stopped u and continued my answers previous time. Now if someone questions me anything, I will answer u first and then, to others. so are u not successful at this?                  I finished making point and as my friends mom called us all for lunch.                                                                       By                                                              Sudha Malladi

       urlLink     Once there lived a man who is blessed by the god and told that he would become rich in next few days. He was soo happy that he started thinking what to do with the money. In the first place he wanted to help his parents get out of financial crisis, “then ? ”, he thought. He then wanted to buy a car, clothes etc…  Þ	On the very first day after he is blessed, he got a letter where by a co. offered him a job in a decent designation scaling 50000/-. He dint go for the interview feeling he is to become rich and he doesn’t need to work. Þ	 After 3 days: he went to make payments at electricity office. While returning home, he saw a small bag full of gold coins under a tree, on the roadside. He feels to take them in greed but suddenly his moral values says not to take as he don’t need others money and “u will have your own one day”. Þ	After 4 days: while going through the newspaper in the morning he starts worrying about the word god gave him. He feels desperate to become rich. Suddenly a hand appears waving in front of his eyes. It’s his mother .she wanted to talk to him about his marriage. But he is not interested as the girl they were talking about comes with a huge dowry amount. Somehow he don’t want to take money from a girl when he will be rich in a matter of time. Anyway, without dowry he marries the girl  Þ	Months pass by, and no sign of money to become rich. He feels frustrated by the desperation and thinks god falsely promised and nothing is true to yield off. Þ	One fine day, while walking across the road a man running from opposite hits him and in a click time he keeps something in his pocket and runs away. Astonished by this he stares back at him. Behind him 2 policemen are running to catch. He keeps his hand in the pocket to see what the thing was. It’s a paper by touch. He takes it out. It’s a lottery ticket. He doesn’t believe in these gambling games and hates them. He never in his life involved in this type of business. He wraps it and throws. Suddenly he sees his old friend standing just front looking at him. “Friends are flowers in the life of garden”. This friend makes our hero happy and they hug. As his friend is in a hurry he asks him to take down his contact no. pen is with him but not a paper so he lifts up the lottery ticket he throwed and note down the no.  Þ	The very next day while going through the newspaper he come across lottery results segment. He is flashed by yesterday’s ticket. He takes it and verifies. Yesss!!!! It’s time to shout “ureka”$$$$$$$$$$$. He got 30 crore in the bumper prize. He thank the god for keeping his word and feels sorry for his foolishness.                        Here the god is relieved from the burden and says “son, I must thank you, atlast u accepted something”.                                                  So all is well that ends well.                                                                      SUDHA MALLADI.

       urlLink        Discover the happiness of hard work.  It will pay you back along with success.  Hard work comes with great determination and will to succeed. It will take pain as interest and passion to work as initial cost.  The want to get something must be such strong that even when you discover the impossible deals in it you feel less strain it is to get your desired wish. Never must a person think he cannot aim at the top but he must realise that top comes from bottom. It is not created by it’s own. Even I’mpossible says that iam possible. Such an optimist can vision his success right from his dream. So I say dare to dream but take care to achieve. Even a single wrong decision can lead to various dimensions. Great people don’t let go the chances instead they create their chances and grasp every opportunity. Never let go the chances as they come once in a lifetime. So I say care to achieve. Pessimist views clear chances as the chances to slip away from the competition. Being positive pays you at any point of time. Don’t think what you can but do whatever you want. Confidence here acts as your bestfriend. Keep it with you always, don’t ignore it. Everyone has a hero inside. Just unleash him and you will invent yourself then suddenly you will realise how simple this world is to win. For you to win it asks for more patience and inspiring thought.                                        By. Malladi sudha.
