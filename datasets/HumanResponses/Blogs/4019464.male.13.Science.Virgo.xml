         When you say nothing at all     It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart   Without saying a word, you can light up the dark   Try as I may I could never explain   What I hear when you don't say a thing The smile on your face lets me know that you need me   There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me   The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall   You say it best.. when you say nothing at all All day long I can hear people talking out loud   But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd (the crowd)   Try as they may they can never define   What's been said between your heart and mine The smile on your face lets me know that you need me   There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me   The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fallYou say it best..    when you say nothing at al The smile on your face lets me know that you need me   There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave meThe touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fallYou say it best.. when you say nothing at all The smile on your face   The truth in your eyes   The touch of your handLet's me know that you need me..
