       Okay now, no more ghost stories and bonechilling movies. Let me tell you about my horrible encounter with a woman on Friday.   It was a Friday morning when the sun shines warmly and the birds chirping sweetly. Then me and my mom went to the old-time sewing serveice shop to somehow edit my pants (because there too WIDE for me to wear. *I am very skinny*). Unlike what the lady assured that her shop is OPEN on the phone just now (as we rang up before going, duh!), the shop was CLOSED!   Because we were in a great hurry (we've got to rush back for lunch before the traffic outside gets congested, or not we would have to starve all the way home...), so my mom knocked the door.   "Pop, pop, pop."   No one responded inside. So she made another attempt.   "Pop, pop, pop."   No response.   So I was quite frustrated, then I banged the door.   "Bang, bang bang!"   Then we heard a woman screaming inside.   "Coming loh! What's your problem! Knock so hard for what? Har? Crazy har?"   Then the door flung open. We saw a firece-looking 18 year-old lady rushing down the stairs.   "Crazy ah?" She shouted at us, who were stunned.   "Why knock so loud?! Want to break the door har?!" Obviously she was throwing her tantrum at us.   Then we turned our back to her and went off, without muttering a word.   "She crazy," I said in anger.   "Yeah..." replied my mother.   So... such a horrrible encounter with a 18 year-old b*tch.   Teddy-O-Ted, oh my~!   *Tips of the day: Never knock the door more than two times.... some b*tches get angry easily.

       Okay, what's up about "hospital holiday"? Let me tell you the truth... indeed, I was really admitted to the hospital! Let me tell you what happens...  &nbsp;  Firstly, I got a terrible headache on Sunday, after taking my little brother to the movies for "Spiderman II". Thanks to the director for all the swinging-in-the-city actions, I got somehow a seroius headache because of dizzyness.  &nbsp;  Then on Monday, when it was school-day (duh!), I vomitted a couple of times (which made me tearing all the day) and so "ta-da!", I went dehydrated, so I left school quite early and headed for the clinic. That's not the serious part yet.  &nbsp;  Tuesday I felt even more groggy, so I went to the same doctor again. She stuffed me with some medicine and then I went back to the boarding school.  &nbsp;  Wednesday I had a high fever and kept moaning and groaning on bed. So I called up my mom. She suggested me to go home for some rest.  &nbsp;  Thursday I went home. On the bus I missed school-day a lot a lot more than usual.  &nbsp;  It's a sunny Friday when I was actually ADMITTED to the hospital. Without any prior notice the doctor slowly placed a needle in&nbsp;the vein in my right hand(while other doctor do it quick and fast), which made me screamed my heart out.  &nbsp;  In the ward my vein was dripped with glucose and my whole right hand cold and paralysed, which left my right hand immobile for two-and-a-half days.  &nbsp;  The food in the hospital was really horrible. Porridge for every meal and no vege no fruits. Aww my god! I was really bored, so I wanted to walk around... but thanks to the dripping machine (which is so heavy and bulky), I was forced to stay in bed!  &nbsp;  Friday night was really scary. Due to shortage of multi-patient wards, I was forced to stay in a single-patient ward. I was so energetic that I watched The Amazing Race, American Idol and another 2 hours crappy movie, which only then hypnotised me.  &nbsp;  Saturday afternoon the doctor said I was okay to be discharged, so I went home. Phew!  &nbsp;  Today is sunday, great! Coz I can get some rest (at last)!  &nbsp;  Teddy-O-Ted, aww my god!  &nbsp;  *Tips of the day - Get prior notice for blood-testing and dripping before being ADMITTED to the hospital!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Due to the oncoming Project's Day, I have to use up my entire precious Saturday for Project work! And there goes my weekend!  &nbsp;  For the whole day I spent 11 solid hours (8am to 12pm, 2pm to 6pm, 8pm tp 11pm) for my Project, named Plant Tissue Culture.  &nbsp;  Mr Goh went extremely sacarstic today. So my group members and&nbsp;I spent ages to modify our ways and types of presentation, and it was really very tiring, duh! We returned to our rooms at 11 pm and we are extremely exhausted! Phew!  &nbsp;  Today morning I had to wake up very early (about 7.30 am, while other can sleep through the morning) in order to reach the Biology Learning &amp; Research Centre at 8.00 am sharp (or else Mr Goh will kill us all)...  &nbsp;  In the afternoon we still have to go to his room (in the boarding school) to do our project, and even after dinner, while everyone went shopping elsewhere, we still have to stay back! Oh dear!  &nbsp;  After a series of mentla torturing, I am finnaly allowed to rest... When I reached my room, my friend was shocked.  &nbsp;  "Oh my Terry, finally you're here! Where have you been for the whole day?"  &nbsp;  And my response is,  &nbsp;  "Thanks to Mr Goh!"  &nbsp;  Teddy-O-Ted, poor thing!  &nbsp;  *Tips of the day - Never approach somebody who looks friendly to be your project mentor (coz Mr Goh looks very freindly duh! And for his picture, pls access  urlLink here ...)

       Okay... another crappy weekend!  Homework always spoil my weekend mood. Chinese, Maths, Physics... everthing! Hope that I would have a happy and pleasant&nbsp;second weekend-of-the-term! Hope so!   Things ain't turning up right when I reached my hostel - the pumps are continueing to leak, when we're desperately looking for a plumber. My laptop got infected with virus when I was about to update my latest virus definition. My roomates' shadows aren't seen anywhere, leaving me in a silent four-bedder room...   Teddy-O-Ted, good luck!   *Tips of the day - Try serving juicy friuts (e.g. watermelons &amp; honeydew) with concentrated lemon juice... they just taste great!!

       Today is quite a stromy day, duh, because literally, today's weather doesn't seem to be nice and tend to screw up all outdoor activites (but today I do not have P.E. Lessons!). So the weather is somehow irritating, although some morons in the class cheered for no outdoor-activites-day...  Here is today's timetable: 1. Chinese 2. Chinese (Double Chinese, Aw...) 3. Chemistry 4. Recess 5. Biology 6. Physics 7. Recess 8. English 9. English (Double English, again, Aw...) 10. Lunch Time 11. Maths 12. Maths (Double Maths, again and again, Aw...)  The bad news is today Miss Wun (my Maths teacher) will be starting lessons immediately after the Double English lesson conducted by Ms Kalavathi (and this make today very STORMY). Luckily I have had my early lunch sometime in the late morning, so I won't attend Maths Lessons with a gastric pain in my tummy.  Worse still, for Maths today Ms Wun is teaching a new topic on logarithm, which made everybody puzzled and confused. She seemed to be rushing through the lines (as she promised that she'll do it as fast as possible) and we get even MORE confused. Luckily she released us at 2.40pm, so that we have ample time to digest the topic.  Another typical rush-through-the-lines lesson is Chemistry. Mr Tan introduced us ionic bonding, which requires lots of memory work... duh. Everybody is tired of following up and he got somehow tired too... haha. Luckily it isn't double Chemistry!  My classmate Tristan is going for the PESA Competition in YMCA (remember the song "Y,M,C,A"?) and Ms Kala wanted us to go there and support him. Seeing that it is NOT compulsory to go there, I choose to return to the boarding school to do my ACE Projects.  Although stormy, but I enjoyed to be in school today as I got another chance to sabotage Johnathan Kee... haha. Edward poured a cupful of water on his table and I scribbled on his foolscap, while Benjamin went somewhere else to hide his pencil box. That's all for today's Johnathan Kee Sabotage Session.  It has been stormy all the day and I think it's time to unplug the LAN Cable - as I am worried about a lightning strike that would ruin my S$2500 laptop.  Teddy-O-Ted, good luck!  *Tips of the day - Do not walk around on a plain when the weather is "not-lookin'-good"...

       Today... another tiring day of me in school. Besides of cut-the-crap lessons and loads of assignments, today I've got a new item in my to-hate list - Maths Test!  Nothing more than functions, permutations and combinations, this Maths Test covers no more stuff. However, studying and preparing myself well enough to passs these topics is really *phew* tiring!  Yesterday night I spent 2 solid hours just studying Maths with my roomate, but my panic today morning left my brain totally blank! Luckily my rusty brain do rang some bells during the test, so I can have something to fill up the aweful spaces...  Today's assembly is a fun one - our dear principal, Mr Hon has reduced the number of ace points from 20% to 15%, which made us feel more comfortable!  I've been noticing that violent objections and debates around the ACE Point gauging for the year... and at last, everything is settled. So, I can pay more concentration on my ACE Points!  Kenn Siang just bought a new Apple laptop and during the night he accidentally came across a wireless network provider which actually allow blue-tooth users to access the net without any cost!  Hope that ACE Points help me to ACE in my studies!  Cheers, Teddy-O-Ted!  *Tips of the day - Try to recycle more aluminium cans as possible! You know why? Coz by recycling each can, you can help the Earth save up to an amount of electricity which would keep the televisio running for 3 hours!

       Something funny I can share with you...     Introduction: This lame and lousy (but funny and entertaining) picture is drawn by our class Mr Super Sacarstic - Edward Seah... (okay, he sucks...) After his attempt for trying to exaplin how Dolly the sheep came about...  Points to note: 1. What is that thing sticking out above the legs? Where is it pointing to? How long is it? 2. If the man is standing on ground, what about the sheep? What is it standing on? 3. Why do you think this was drawn? To explain genetics engineering or how Animal Farm and the talking animals came about? 4. Explain the big cross on the picture, which is drawn by Mr Goh.

       To be brief:   We saw a bug (looks like a bee, but not a bee, but assembles a bee, but scientifically NOT a bee!) on the teachers table.   So it was Maths lesson and Ms Wun walked in.   She screamed. *Oh my! That was LOUD!!!*   She was scared out of her soul - she wanted us to remove the bug.   We people who are lablled as "sadistic morons" squashed the bug with a glass panel.   *White and yellow liquid ozzing out... YUCKS!!!*   Miss Wun said, "Get rid of the liquid too!" *That was the real disgusting part...*   Then we did... and we had our Maths lesson peacefully...   Oh, something to note... I nearly expereinced a heart seizure&nbsp;today morning at about 6.00am. Wow, just a glaring flash and the lightning went "KA - BOOOOM" which I screamed my heart out. Phew!   Teddy-O-Ted, yucks!   *Tips of the day - Never squash a bug with a glass panel when the Maths teacher is around in order to prevent mental disorder and the repetition of Happy Tree Friends...&nbsp;

       Today is a happy day to me. I've got a new place to share my expereinces with anybody around the world. So, maybe this can be summarized to "globalization"? Haha.   Something to note... today is a Thursday, a very bad hair day to me (because there's lots of lessons to attend!)  Nothing more to say, except some description for today: CRAPPY...  Teddy-O-Ted, good-and-bad!  *Tips of the day - Share your feeling with people around the world via blog! Nice way duh!

       Today is a very meaning full day for me, Tristan and other people of our class. This is the very very first time a Chinese High School student made it into the Finals of the Plain English Speaking Competition (PESA) Competition!  I reached YMCA at 12.20 pm and found only Boing Yuan / Lucy / I-Pad and Bryan Tee in the McDonalds... no one else of my class is there yet!  Competiton started, and I found out that the speakers are damn good, worried about Tristan... however, he did very well for his impromptu competition!  Kala came late and so the others of my class...  After the competition for the Secondary Schools have completed, I took my leave with Koon Yu and Jonathan Kees. During the journey to the nearest MRT, Zhi Yong called Koon Yu that Kala was very angry as a lot of people left after the secondary school competition and not continueing to watch the competition of the JC Levels...  At Douby Ghaut MRT, the Red Line looked to have some problems and there is a distruption in the entire line... guess that whether an accident occurred...  MRT service resumed and splited with Koon Yu at the interchange...  Nice day today if without Kala...  Teddy-O-Ted, PESA is nice, but not again with Ms Kala there...  *Tips of the day - Never ever leave early if you know that a teacher gonna be angry!

       I am almost dead!  Firstly, I am forced to sing on the stage with my friends, WEX (Low Wei Xiang) and Jack during the Sec 3 Assembly today... a theme song from the oldies cartoons - Lion King's Can You Feel The Love Tonight... It was really a *Phew*! My high-pitched voice nearly made the hairs of the entire secondary to stand! I only sang the chorus, so that's the lucky part (as my memory is extremely limited due to oncoming tests!)...  Secondly, as mentioned above, I am busy mugging with tests... Integrated Humanities (1) Test on tomorrow, Integrated Humanities (2) Test and Physics Test on Friday! I really don't dare to think anymore! Surely fail!  Thridly, I broke a beaker during Biology Practical.. that costs me about S$3.30!  Fourthly, Mr Goh announced our Biology Test marks during Biology Practical and I am shocked to get just a C6... oh no! Although Mr Goh said that my marks may be not counted into the results due to my 2-week longleave, I'm still very sad about it!  Not much to say... almost dead!

       Today is a shopping-cum-family day, so I followed my mum to Midvaleey Megamall in Kuala Lumpur...  Luckily we reached there early, so that we can aviod the lunchtime crowd for Teppanyaki! (Of course, not to mention, my mom did a very plasure shopping for her cosmetics!)  Went to Sushi King for snack at 3pm... really tired of shopping and eating and walking! *Phew...  Bah, read the same old programming books in MPH... came across some Maths question which reminds me of my unfinished Maths homework (still bothering me when I'm doing shopping!), aw!  Went to Aunt house at 4.30pm, younger brother playing PS for the whole evening, forcing me to play he old time game Scrabbel with my bored dad. Mum had a great time chit-chatting (crapping?) with my Aunt...  Aunt's family and my parent went out for dinner, leaving me and my brother at aunt's house. Bored, duh!  Teddy-O-Ted, bored to death!  *Tips of the day - When you know your mum wanna buy cosmetics, please choose a crowded time slot so that she can't buy a thing (which makes her leave quickly!) Haha!

       I reached home at 4am today morning, as I followed my aunt back to Malaysia for a short break. Thank you Singpore for giving such a long holiday! *Phew, at least I can temporarily escape from overwhelming stress...  Bah, what I did for the whole morning and afternoon is a presentation on Paradox for Maths ACE... hope that this thing would save me from my critical state of ACE Points!  Went to Subang Parade to do some boring shopping. At least what I benefited from this trip to the mall is that I got a long-sleeve shirt in my dreams (but now NOT anymore!)... actually I was first hesitating whether to buy or not, as what Boing Yuan / Lucy / I-Pad told me a horrible experience by wearing long-sleeve shirt. He said that he wore it to a concert and met up with Mr Goh (my form teacher duh!). Guess what Mr Goh said.  "Wah, wearing pyjamas har?" he made a remark.  Anyway, I'm happy today.  Teddy-O-ted, wow, new shirt!  *Tips of the day - never ever wear long-sleeve shirt when having an outing with sacarstic people...

       Bah... this term's Hwa Chong Sabbaticals are so unappealing and many kiasu people like Jun Kai and morons like Jonathan Kee (by the way, we blasted Jonathan Kee by requesting the change of date of the Physic Term Test - coz term test are fixed, duh!) and Robert Gao made is worse! Oh my... (speechless!)  Okay... I have to sign up for the HRP (HwaChong Research Programme) coz I am short of science ACE Points, although it'll cost about S&95.00! Because of some kiasu people and morons, cheap-and-slack Sabbaticals are taken up first... so I am forced to choose... baw!  I am still greatly short of ACE Points... Have to "piah" this weekend already!  Die lah!  By the way, it's fun to have some morons like Jonathan Kee, Robert Gao and kiasu people like Jun Kai to be in your class - they spice up your life by: (a) allowing you to sabotage them as you like (this applies to Jonathan Kee) (b) allowing you to cirtisize them as your fun (this applies to Jun Kai) (c) allowing you to make fun with nicknames (Real Name: Gao Chong ; Nickname: Robert Gao Dick)  Ah, last, but not least, today is National Day Celebration (which I can skip coz I'm not a Singaporean... hehe) and I have to seat for my sickening Chinese Common Test...  If this blog have ever offended anybody (like Jun Kai, who is very concerned about this, coz he want "face", duh!)...   TOO BAD!   Teddy-O-Ted, haha!  *Tips of the day - Do not miss lessons too long... you'll end up with lotz of work to cope!

       Today is a very horrible day... because the timetable is almost filled up!  We have Maths on the last two periods, which starts at 2.00pm and ends at 3.20 pm. Then the Maths Representative - Bing Yuan (Nickname: Boing Yuan [coz he's fat, duh!]; Lucy [I gave it to him today!] and I-Pad [coz our whole class is envy of him to have an I-Pod...]) , announced that the BORING Maths lesson would start 15 minutes earlier - at 1.45pm, which obviously hinting us that we'll gonna lose 15 minustes of lunch time! Oh no!  But luckilyKala had a very horrible sorethroat, so she gave us some notes and I dozed off (too BORING, but very good, coz very SLACK). I did my English Oral Presentation about Genetically Modified (GM) Food, and some morons like Jiang Zhou accused me for taking advantage (beacuse my Biology project is also something about GM Food...) Too bad... haha!  Ms Wun nentered the class and started the ball rolling by... (a) Rushing through the lines about BORING Linear Law (b) Rushing through the lines about BORING Logarithms (c) Crapping about what she had had for lunch (d) Distributing worksheets  Guess... make your choice now!  Okay, answer is out... (d) Distributing worksheets. She distributed 5 different worksheets in 3 minutes! Fast duh! But we gonna suffer!  "These are the worksheets I am expecting you people to complete them during the LONG LONG National Day Weekend..." she said. But i don't think the weekend is LONG enought for poor souls like we people to complete the qhole stack of worksheets.  Then she gave us a whooooolllly ONE HOUR free time (of course, to do worksheets)  Of course, due to my limited knowledge about Logarithms, I approached Boing Yuan / Lucy / I-Pad for help. Thenwe did homework together - but it ended up that most of the time I was copying his answer... Whoopsy!  Tiring day... I walked back to the boarding school with a WHOLE STACK of unfinished worksheets...  Teddy-O-Ted, die lah!  *Tips of the day - Be mentally prepared for lots of homework and assignments when a LONG weekend is approaching!

       Today is Biology Common Test and *oh my god* it is really horrible...  Luckily I memorised about the opart of cheese-making (which the question took up 8 marks upon 50! *That was a lot!) and Benji (Benjamin) nearly killed me as he is jealous about what I studies is out in the exams.  Lu Jie kept smilling over the recess, and our classmates blasted him for knowing everything and answering the questions perfectly! This is inevitable, as he is a cyborg.  Wayne seemed to be frustrated, and so do Jiayi (including Benjamin!), for not studying about the cheese-making part. Instead, almost the whole class missed out to study the miserable small paragraph about cheese-making.  Hence during Biology Lesson my classmates kept mourning "Cheeeeeeeeeese!!!" in front of Mr Goh.  Okay, today is mainly about this... I really do not want to recall what I've written on the paper!  Teddy-O-Ted, good luck!  *Tips of the day - It is proven wrong that you study the large paragrpah and information that the teahcer emphasise on... do study EVERYTHING!

Okay, today is the one-month anniversayr for the dear bug to be squashed under the glass paenl in my classroom. We morons were mourining for it... stupid duh!

       Mugging for 3 August's Biology Common Test... lots of stuff to remember. Polypeptides, restriction enzymes, cheese-making, wine-making, nucleotides, DNA replication, mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, Uracil, cloning, anticodons, sequence, bah! *Brain flooded with information...  Can't think much about what happened today...  Oh yeah, the only thing I remember I did today is I went to Junction 8 to watch "I, Robot". Great movie, great time with Sunny, the NS-5 robot... this reminds me of Lu Jie (who is probably mugging for Bio Test like "siao"), who is a cyborg...  Teddy-O-Ted, collapsing for Bio Test! Must get A1! Get A1! (but I only have faith in Lu Jie)  *Tips of the day - (can't think of a thing)...
