      Its Saturday and its supposed to be the weekend .. Internationally at least... unfortunately, over here, I'm not so lucky..   Well, its my off day but due to some warped up system over here. Only Friday is the weekend... every other day, its a busy work week. Now is that even fair? But who are we to judge? I was working on Friday while everyone was out having their fun .. fairness has been out of my dictionary a long time when I was back home working in an industry which required me to work 7 days a week... Now i'm in a job which is so irregular that I don't know to be happy or to be sad.  Do I sound very cynical and depressing in my posts? Hmmm, I'm not always like that.. usually, I do have a smile on my face every once in a while.. and I'm the "little girl" in my work place.. but thoughts run through my head every 5 minutes like how sex run through men's heads every... what... 5 to 10 seconds.. For me, its thoughts about life, love, religion etc... its just that ever since I've gotten here, I've not had a chance to express these thoughts and its becoming rather cynical as time goes by, allowing it to brood in my head for a tad bit long ..   I'm a smiley girl.. people just have to notice.

      Yes,   The moment work ended, I got home, took a shower and out I went to prowl the streets over here... Went clubbing once again and this time, not so disappointing... Met a cute english boy .. if I only knew his name.. He was hot hot hot .. now, why do i bother typing all these out knowing that no one really gives a damn when it comes to reading it unless the content itself is worth the attention..  Unfortunately, I don't really give a shit..   Now, where was I ... yummy english boy .. dancing with his pal... who by the way, abandoned him a million times..... sadly enough, he got my jokes and he was hilarious.. but ... got no fate la ...   I'm zoning out as I'm writing this ... so please do forgive the weak weak attempt in trying to make this remotely exciting or even funny.. but I had to get it off my chest, else I would always be in a mess..

      Ok  Its interesting to go clubbing and not drink a single drop of alcohol at all.   I really do wonder if the way the people act around me depicts how I myself act around them in my drunken stupor.   I see friends of mine being a "flying bird", flying from one flower to another...   Rudeness though is something I cannot tolerate (oh my, I know I've heard this line somewhere in my line of work)  If someone offers to give you a ride down to the club (means not having to pay the cab fare there), I think the least that one can do is to at least have a decent conversation with the poor man who took time out to do such a kind deed. So, the guy may not necessarily be the hottest man at the club, but for goodness sake, I am sure a little decent conversation would be better than just plainly ignoring him and yet still expecting drinks to be at the table when you're down flying around! Its not like the guy was expecting you to sleep with him or something (coz if he does, he is a pretty sad creature).  A WORD I've learnt from my fellow Filipino friends "KORIPOT" (please do forgive me for any spelling error).. meaning STINGY.. This phrase is best used on people who didn't even offer to repay back the person who HELPED to pay for the drinks! And trust me, it was a GUY who has gotten the honour of being crowned with this TITLE..  Note: I'm no sexist and am not into this whole FEMINIST RIGHTS and stuff but I still feel that men have to learn how to be a gentleman!  Hmmmm, what else made my day.. right ..   The fact that men don't tell you about their "status" until you asked them and before you ask them, they seem to be all over you ... now, whats up with that? I pity their girlfriends whom they claim to love so much ... I wouldn't call that love now would I! And people wonder why till this very day, I still do not believe in this whole concept of LOVE..  Cute men are plenty but many nice ones are gay. Its really sad. The rest of the population who do go clubbing in the Middle East... no comments...

      Alright,   So this is it.. My first entry into this strange world of blogging... What does this all mean actually. Why do i want to share my life, my views and my thoughts about life, and everything else for that matter?  This is a question which i believe plagues everyone's mind when they first get hooked onto this whole new world. Or maybe not.  I'm living somewhere in the middle east.. but no, I'm no middle eastern. I'm a Singaporean. What am I doing in this little town(not to mention the blazing heat and absolute boredom that I face every day)?   Well, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I need the money to pay the countless bills and "stuff" that i've accumulated over the years of my life in good ole Singapore... School Fees, Mobile Phone bills, unit trusts, stocks... you name it, I've got it.. Its this whole "kiasu" syndrome in me.. Get myself stuck in everything thinking its good for me and ending up paying through my nose till I bleed and die at the ripe old age of 55 (or at least thats when I think I would live up to)  Back to the whole point of what am I doing HERE?!   I'm with an airline company..   Doing what? Hmmm... well, thats kinda like a slap in the face isn't it ... oh well, maybe its just me...   Well, I'm heading out to a club to watch the world go by.. I plan to write a pscyhology thesis soon... Not sure what the title is going to be but I do know its going to be about the airline industry, the people, the places, the work.. I just need to find a point to start on....   Oh well, its just a chance for me to practice what I really and truely wanna do later on in my life, after all the bills are cleared and the $$ in my bank grows into a substantial amount ..   But for now, I'm going with the flow ..
