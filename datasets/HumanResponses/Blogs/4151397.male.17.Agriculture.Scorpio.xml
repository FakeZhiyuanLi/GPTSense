       So, after crying most of the night until I fell asleep. I woke up, at about 10:30 and just laid in bed for a while. I got on and talked to a few people, and now I'm here. Last night, I talked to Jeff. He's coming out here today to get me and I'm gonna stay at his place. We're going to build a new computer for me, since this one is trash. New XP, new hard drive, new video card, new tower, new whatever. Then, we will do something on wednesday. I don't know what yet? He said something about going out causing trouble. Anyways. his car is in the shop right now getting fixed. It'll be done this evening. So, when my Mom comes home from work I'll leave with him out to his place and we'll do our thing.  I don't know what I'm going to do for the rest of the day? It's rainy out. I'll probably just lift, and do some exercises. Oh yeah, I'm on this diet. Like, you don't eat for a month, you exercise, and drink nothing but water. My friends said it works. It worked for them, so why not me? I know it's not the healthiest way to go, but, what the hell right? I could be doing coke like some other people I know, but that just screws your mind up. Hmm, scratch what I said about my Mom working. My brother just came in here and said that she doesn't work today. I guess she traded days. She only works 3 days a week lol. Crazy. I'm going to start a different blog here soon. It's going to be,  urlLink http://jay.ultravibe.net  It will consist of stuff about me, my poetry, photography,  my insights on things in general, and of course my journal. I'll let you know when I change over to it. It's going to be pretty hot. Oh yeah, I forgot to upload that picutre of me and my new cousin on here. I've just been so out of it, you know, as usual. I'll get it on here, if not on the new one for sure. Well, I'm gonna go. Oh I forgot, today is day one of no eating. They said, after 3 days, your stomach stops hurting. I hope nothing bad happens to me, and I end up in the hospital for not eating for a month. Okay, later.  -big jay

       Hmm, you know. Why am I around anymore? I mean, Tanya, I love you so much. You don't understand that. I want you in my life. I miss you. I'm not IMing you or any of that, I'm respecting what you want. You don't have to say anything to me, I understand. But, I do want you to know, that even though what you said in your journal about not thinking about me, and not caring -- I still care and think about you. I can't believe what you said to Post tonight. I'm so hurt. You probably don't care that I'm hurting either. I'm in tears.   Why was I put on this earth? Whats the point of me being here?   You know, it's funny. I noticed I'm a lot like my  real  dad. Speaking of my  dad , I saw him for the first time in my life the other day at the light in Ashtabula with my Gramma. She's like, "Hey, theres your dad!", and I look over. I'm like, "really?!" and shes like, "Yeah! Do you want me to call his name?". I tell her, "No Gram, it's okay."  I glance at him, and I see, that I'm a loser as he is. A low life. A piece of shit, waste of air.  I mean, I lost the love of my life. Everyone rips me, talks shit behind my back, breaks my heart, pushes me around like dirt, uses me for money, calls me racist just because I joke around (even though I have a lot of black friends, grew up in the section 8/ghetto area most my life, have 3 black family members) and I'm racist for saying jokes? I'm controling? Hardly, you people control me more then I do you. I let everyone PUNK me out. I hold back from EVERYTHING. I don't blow up. I don't ruin peoples lives.  Sorry that I'm not the nice, tall, fit, tan, sexy guy everyone wants. Sorry that I don't have big hands and feet. Sorry that I'm so hairy. Sorry for anything physically about me that you people don't like. Sorry that I don't have "hot abs".  I wish you could remember our first kiss. I wish you could remember the good times over the bad. I wish we could do it again. I want to change, I'm doing it -- I am.  I have to stop, before I hit rock bottom. Before I have an emotional break down. Then again, why do you people care? Ha, I'm a joke right? Who cares about John. The one person that I want to care the most, doesn't. How do you think that makes me feel? Go have someone hit you with a bat 100 times, full power, and you'll get a sample of the pain I have. I wish you could feel the aches in my heart, like knifes, they are slowly slicing it.  I just want to make this crystal clear, if i cant have  you  -- I  dont  want  no one   else  ~ ever......  again.     I'm out, I don't know when I'll be back. I........  -the not so seksi jay

       Well, I didn't get to hang out with Jeff and everyone. Jeffs car broke down when he was racing a del sol. The gas clutch I think he said. I was going to call up some other people but no, I changed my mind. I wanted to stay home and think instead. Anyways, I'm on the phone with Post. I was on the phone with cmc and tvd, but he called. I'll be back on with them later. I'm gonna go make art, listen to this italian song, and relax.  -jay

        Hey, I'm back home again. I was in Mentor for a while chillin' and took a pic with my new cousin who was born on 8/11. He's cute. I want a baby :(. I'll upload it later. Uhm, I have a lot of messages from friends since I was gone. I guess I'll go hit them up and see what's going on tonight. I don't know if I'm chillin' with Jeff and them because he hasn't call me yet, and I forgot his cell #. I need to add it in my phone, along with everyone elses. Grrrr! I talked to Joce some more, and it looks like I'll be coming up. It's cool with my Mom and all. So, I'll be gettinga hotel up in mentor from 8/20 to 8/23. I want to see Tanya really bad too!I wish she'd care just a tid bit to see me. It'd make my week. -sigh- She said to give her the space she wants and to respect her, so, I'll try? I just don't want to not talk to her, and then, nevermind.  Well, I'm out. I may write again later, if not, then tomorrow I will.       -jay

        Life sucks, but it sure is going just fine for others isn't it ;)...     Don't nag her they say... Chill out they say... Give her the space she wants they say... Just leave her alone for a while they say... Jay listen they say... It'll be okay they say ...it'll be okay they say    "Boxing is...brains over brawn"    "It's not how big the dog is in the fight It's how big the fight is in the dog"   Anyways, I'm going out tonight with Jeff, Josh, Chris, Shawn, and some other people. My old friends from the hood. Besides that, I'm going out to Mentor today. Chill and whatever -- then I'm going back to Columbus.  -ace

        Hey, sorry for not posting. I've been up at my Grand Parents since the 7th. I'm going home on the 16th, and then I'm pretty sure I'm coming back up on the 20th and getting a hotel with Trevor, my cousins boyfriend. It's going to cost a lot of money, but it's okay. I'd like to see Tanya -- but, I don't know if she will see me. I know what she said in her journal, but I can't let go. She's the "love of my life" (song she told me to dl   -Jay      (last night on couch)   me: How do I look in pink?   joce: It looks good on you.   trevor: You look hot.   (trevor puts on hat)   me: you don't look good in pink.   trevor: I know, it doesn't look good on skinny people.   me: wtf bitch your calling me fat?   trevor: No no no, it's just, that when it's on you, you look like a big cuddly teddy bear.   joce: Awwwww!   me: (smiles ~ blush) shut up!
