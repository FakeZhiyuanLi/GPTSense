I have many pictures of mr. center and i look at them all the time lol. many snaps to ljly who has accomplished making mr c. think ljly's gay. oh...and Lidge? Write longer posts...they are more amusing. oh god i have gotten into so much trouble this week! It makes my head hurt. i DID get to go to the mall tho. it was kinda a disaster but i got new chuck taylors so life is fine, fine as wine, life is fine. They are white. I really wanted to get lowtops but all they had wwere hightops. LJLY! the infinite wonders of summer vacation...no mo getting made fun of by a fat kid and an old man!

      My parents are fighting again. Actually, it would be way more unusual for me to say "my rents are being nice to each other again". God i live in such a dumb world. the only thing that keeps me going is the knowledge that tomorrow the new Avril Lavigne album, Under my Skin, comes out. it is a day i have been waiting for for over 2 years. I'm really quite excited. actually, i'm excited out of my mind. AHH!!! I can not wait. I'm re-reading the Princess Diaries series. I know they sound stupid but they are funny. Exept Mia's a vegetarian and, well, i'm a huntress. But she's not real so what ever. my moms coming home today. we're going to see TROY and go shopping for camp. i  can't wait  for camp to begin. urghy...i have to wait till  June 4th  to leave. then i'm coming back  July 4th  or fifth. not really sure and too bored and tired to check. have any of y'all heard when the 6th Harry Potter book is coming out?? I wanna know...unlike ludacris in his crap new song. well, there's the boogie parade. buhbye. wolf

      Ha...I'm so creative at naming my posts. Just watching Fuse (channel 226) and Switchfoot welcomed me to the planet...they're ok...though i must say i prefer Avril. 3 more days till her album comes out. i'm so happy! Im on vacation. God...i gotta remember to get that lost prophet cd...and Chevelle. I like trapt's new song. i'm so pumped...i have 37 GOOD cds! (as of today) but i am dirt broke...seriously. I must remember to go to the mall...goshamighty. Well, i am at a loss for words cos im so tired, but i'll write back later today. Maybe. Ok so boredness won me over. Yes i am back. And yes i am speaking to no one cos no one reads this. but we can all pretend cant we? ljlyslife.blogspot.com--me amigo...go there...he's quite amusant. Sign my guestbook whoever reads this *HACK* no one. damnit im bored...i am also quite thirsty. what i wouldnt do for a coke. my brother is hogging the computer. damn him. I LOVE YOU MR. CENTER! Yes, i just thought i would blurt that out. How do you spell "Canada"? C-EH-N-EH-D-EH. Does anyone get that but me? speaking of butts, there's a bug on mine. Yessirree now its mush. I think i should be a music vid. coreographer for MTV. That would be a good idea and i'd get paid SHLOADS of moolah-moolah. Well...more later--tomorrow.

        Hey...I'm Wolf. No, that's not my REAL name. But the whole secret identity crap kind of intrigues me. I am sitting at school. More about school later...it wouldn't be such a good idea to write about it now. Hmmm...5 more days untill the Avril Lavigne album comes out! Yes, I am the world's Avril fan. I also love Blink 182 and Linkin Park. I've been to all their concerts at least once. I've seen Avril twice. Once in Ohio and once in Texas. I know no one will probably ever look at this blog but I'm writing it anyway for my own amusement.  Well, our teacher is insisting us leave the laptops. Write more later. -Wolf   Oh no...its me again. At homeo. Well, my sister's in town so tomorrow I might go to the mall. Maybe I can get a spiked collar. No, I do not think I am a punk but I have always harbored a secret desire to own a spiky necklace. Not to wear, but to have and to hold. Yo...visit my bud ljly's blog. by
