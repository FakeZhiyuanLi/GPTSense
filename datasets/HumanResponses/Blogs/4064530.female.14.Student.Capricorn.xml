         mood:confused,frustrated,craving & bored as hell... and im mad music:Velvet Revolver ~Slither~      well so much for getting outta the house today... kenny couldnt go to the movies... oh well... we'll just try to go next weekend.  sometimes the craving to cut is so strong... i dont know what the fuck im going to do... i want to cut sooo bad but i have to stop because im going to lose all of my friends and i'll have to see that fuckin therapist sooner... and besides all i have is a dull razor that doesnt even work... im lucky to even have that... i want my other razors back they worked so much better... and i was happier when i was cutting... no one saw that did they... no the didnt all they saw was the chance that i might proceed to something even worse than just creating scars on my legs... to suicide... but i cant even think of ever doin that... i want to live and be loved not die unloved... i wont ever commit suicide so i dont see why everyone worries... why cant they just let me be and give my razors back so i can be happy again... i hate how i always want to make everyone else happy before myself... for once i want to make myself happy no one else... but nope... i just dont see how it hurts everyone else to see me cutting... it doesnt hurt me and im not cutting them... i just dont get it... its fuckin stupid the way people worry about me... yeah its nice to be paid attention to but i dont want to be worried about... i dont want to be pitied because i cut or anything of that sort... i just want to be left alone i dont cut to get attention... i hate attention the only thing i want is to be loved... such a stupid thing to want at this age... lol oh well thats what i want... i want someone to love me and hold me and atleast try to understand how i feel inside... and me being this young its hard to find someone because everyone only wants sex sex sex and more sex no one at my age wants to commit themselves to a relationship... there are some people who do but usually theyre already taken so... im stuck by myself... oh well... im gonna get going now... write more l8er...     just a lil quiz... i love alice :)    urlLink      here are a few reasons why i cut....     Escape from emptiness, depression, and feelings of unreality.     In order to ease tension.     Relief: when intense feelings build, self-injurers are overwhelmed and unable to cope. By causing pain, they reduce the level of emotional and physiological arousal to a bearable one.     Expression of emotional pain.    Relief of anger: many self-injurers have enormous amounts of rage within. Afraid to express it outwardly, they injure themselves as a way of venting these feelings.     Exerting a sense of control over one's body.      &nbsp;     just some random quotes i found that i liked ...     Per me si va nella citta dolente,   Per me si va nell'eterno dolore,Per me si va tra la perduta gente.Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch'entrate!(This way for the sorowful city,This way for eternal suffering,This way to join the lost people.All hope abandon, ye who enter here!)   -"Inferno," Dante Alighieri    "i hurt myself todayto see if i could feeli hurt myself you saidto try to make him feelso i hurt myself againto see if he'd see mei hurt myself againi know he never could see me."   -"Hurt (introduction to Caught a Lite Sneeze)," Tori Amos          "got a little red linethat tells you, boywhere the razor's been."   -"Never Seen Blue," Tori Amos          "Self-injury is a sign of distress not madness. We should be congratulated on having found a way of surviving."   -Cory Anderson          "Pain is always preferable to numbness."   -"Triage," Scott Anderson    "I'll draw you a picture,I'll draw it with a twist,I'll draw it with a razorblade,I'll draw it on my wrist.And if I draw it correctly,a red fountain will appear...to wash away my sorrows,to chase away my fears."   -Anonymous        "Icy claws with tender touches are the gifts she brings to me. Swallowed in the mindless void of sex and misery."   -Anonymous        "Well in case you failed to notice,In case you failed to see,This is my heart bleeding before you,This is me down on my knees."   -"Foolish Games," Jewel        "'Cutting myself was something beyond despair, something very extreme,’ Johnstone says, speaking in quiet tones. ‘It’s about trying to get to something. The physical act is a metaphor of trying to access something that is frozen. Something between who you were and since the depression who you’ve moved to and there’s this thick layer of ice and you can’t get to yourself. You’re really excavating to try and find yourself again. It’s a positive act even though people around you find it horrible, self-destructive, terrifying and think that you have literally gone crazy.'"   -"A Head Full of Blue," Nick Johnstone    "If being sane is thinking there's something wrong with being different... I'd rather be completely fucking mental."   -Angelina Jolie
