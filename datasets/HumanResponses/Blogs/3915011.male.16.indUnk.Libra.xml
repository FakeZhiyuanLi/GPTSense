         OOowWW…. My muscles… So pain… Early morning (round 9 haha) I wake up n find that my muscles are in pain… now is better… Yesterday was the 7K’s. Chu and I went there around 2 something and when to gym+sauna+Jacuzzi from 3.00 till 4.30p.m. (Thanks Chia min).After that we joined the 7k’s run… B4 we start, I received a call from double a saying that X is not coming… I was so so sad…   I manage to finish the race within 55 minutes. Chu was much earlier than me… When I arrived he was bathing in the toilet…After that, we went to find the others... There, I saw X… Aaron played a big joke on me… Then we when to 5 sail 4 dinner. There were 12 of us there… We were having a lot of fun there… There was a dish called “banana mix with coconut milk”… It was damn horrible man… After I ate the Red bean with coconut milk… My stomach starting to feel bad… I can’t stuff anything in anymore… I din even go 4 the second round…There we chat a lot…   Everything was just perfect during the dinner time but after dinner … Everything changed… The couples starting to go their own way to their own little heaven n hav their own world which no one can interrupt… Luckily there is Chu n fong there with me… We hav a great time watching the fireworks… haha… Conclusion… The night was perfect… N Thanks Aaron... N also Chu… My night won’t be perfect without u guys helping me…

          If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us and purify us   from all unrighteousness.            -1 John 1:9-   God is Good    God is good&nbsp; All the time  He put a song of praise in this heart of mine  God is good&nbsp; All the time    Through the darkess night    His light will shine   God is good God is Good    All the time...   If your walking  Through the valley And there are shadows all around Do not fear He will guide you And he will keep you safe and sound HE has Promise to never leave you Nor forsake you And His word is true

         Today!!~ The story telling competition was today!! I din know bout this and I didn't prepared at all... Last minute I ask my dear friend Chu to replace me... I got an article entitle "the selfish giant" written by Melissa melody from the hornbill and tell him to read from it...( a lot of grammar mistake in the text)...&nbsp;Dun think we hav a chance to win...If just we hav more time to prepared I think we can get very good result cause the others contestant also....&nbsp;           &nbsp;     After sch, Most of my friend got to go home early except me... Staying back 4 Chinese Lit class... I was so0oo tired that till I fall asleep in the class while&nbsp; the teacher was away. After the class, I saw chien yen ,aaron=yun ling, fong ,mia=Roger...Inside pejabat am. I went in and chat 4 a while... Then I followed chien yen's car home...        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2morrow is the 7k oredi...&nbsp;I skip my&nbsp;church service on Saturday nite...Dun know why I hav this feeling that I'm not belong to the&nbsp;Eklektos youth anymore... If b4, I sure will go to church rather then others places... But I seems to take the 7k more seriously then my church service. Dun know&nbsp;why I have this feeling that I'm not belong to the Eklektos youth anymore... Mayb it's b'cus I can't get along with some of the youth&nbsp;in the church and that&nbsp;makes me feel very bad... Is this how the devil is trying to deceive,distract ,disconnect and destroy me from God. By making me feel lonely and neglected in church. My social life is getting worst... Even with my friends in sch... If anyone of you are Christian ... pls pray 4 me...&nbsp; I need ur prayers...           &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think I hav to sleep earlier to recharge my energy after a busy bc day...
