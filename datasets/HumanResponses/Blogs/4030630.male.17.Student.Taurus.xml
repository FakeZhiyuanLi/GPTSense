      Phew, finally,almost everythings over. The physics quiz..sigh, it`s a waste of time. It`s so freaking hard i think no one in the country can get 70% of the question. As for me... haha.. if i get more than 20 question right.. i`ll be super grateful. The paper consist of 70 question and the quiz time is 2 and a half hours. It starts at 9.00 am. I was doing until question number 50 and i realise that it`s already 11. Yaiks. 30 more minutes to go and i still got more 1/3 of the paper to go. Anyway..i rush through all the question and now.. it`s in god`s hand. Later on that day. i spent like 35 ringgit fixing my hp. Sigh. spoiled d, and also got cheated with a chicken chop. They just place the chicken on a sizziling plate and charge me rm 3 extra compare to a normal chicken chop which they place on a plate. sigh. Why i always get cheated on food!!

      &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the school, hmm... just in time i guess. And there was a assembly as usual (every single day.. stupid school!!) I just park my bike and i heard the annocement.. " diminta Alexander Loh" sila berjumpa dengan Puan Tan Choy Year selepas perhimpunan" ... sigh.. come come school already being wanted.. Then.. i got a small brifing for my next week`s National inventing and engineering competition. So damm lazy to do my project.. been like doing for ages.. and still haven`t finish doing it. Just came back from Sarawak and have to ready for another competition...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then.. i bugged my teacher to inquire about the national physics quiz. It`s so unfair..every single school in the country entering and my school is not.. I ask the teacher and she say she didn`t receive the letter.. I went to see my physics teacher, then my ketua panitia sains and my ketua bidang sains.. turn their heads upside down and demand that i want to enter.. mwahaha.. they have to give face cuz we actually represented Selangor for science quiz.. I hope the teacher will really be able to get a place for us in the quiz.. but the chances are 0.0001%.. cuz the closing date have gone way long ago and the setting already all done.. the competition is on saturday... sigh.but I STILL WANT TO ENTER THE QUIZ!!!!!!!!

       Well... finally, the end of my journey in my science quiz.. it`s kinda sad cuz i was really enjoying this quiz and we are like 1 more round to go and we will get to sweeden.. aww..what a waste.. but it was just fated... we can`t even press a damm buzzer for christ sake.. the st joseph school are way to fast... (wonder did they bewitch the buzzers??) ..anyway.... they are pretty cool and well prepare.. they really deservo to win for all the reasons in the world. For one thing..they actually studied for sometime while we were laying flat on our bed watching some kinda stupid show.          Anyway... i seriously enjoy the whole trip there (except for the quiz it self... cuz we lost!!! ) .. we ended up second place... we would have been likely to be champion if we were in other zons.. their score seems to be pretty weak... and we would definetly score way higher if the st joseph`s boys hands were not that fast..sigh.. well..but on the other hand.. i was thankful to be in this zone for i meet the nicest person you can find on earth... it`s the st joseph boys.. Marcus Lee and Samuel Tsan.. you guys are cool (and of course smart too) .. hahaha... i`ll really look forward to another pool game..hahahaha         So what do i think about this whole national science quiz thing. Well.. from the very starting.. it`s seems to be a dream to get to this far.. oh come on man.. one stupid school from kajang which nobody on earth have ever heard on it get to the first round of national lvl.. We are the best in Selangor.. I`m seriously proud of that.. i owe all my thanks to my teammates.. Aqtar and Saha.. without them.. i`m in nowhere. So my finals standing of the end of our journey? believe it or not.. we enjoyed the damm thing. (even though we lost) ..hahaha

              Now the last of my worries is over. My test have over (  i seriously don`t want to know the results). I`m free again. actually not really that free cuz spm haven`t over yet. But without and project and quiz. Life`s definetly more peaceful. Today is the one saturday that i didn`t have for a very very long time. I woke up at 10.. so happy. everyday i have to wake up early. Then i on my pc and start blogging.        The month of july have definetly been the busiet month in my life. But nevertheless.. i enjoyed it. All the quiz and competition have been a good teacher to me. I gain lots of experience and some really pretty cool friends. Now all that`s over. I guess i have to adapt back to my old peaceful life together with my dear PC. Can`t live without my comp. It`s been long since i can play games for 10 hours a day, go to mamak until the wee hours and go "yan cha" whenever i want. I`m going to get all this back, but maybe after spm. My trial on sept 7. Have to start preparing from now d. I don`t want to regret later. I hope the Lord will really give me strenght to study without getting bored and maybe limit me from playing to much games..hehehe..

      Today, the result were announce. I got 3rd. hahaha.. pretty cool. The first place did a reserach on the Kenaf plant that can be use to assorb oil. The second place did a flying dish. Pretty impresive also until i learned that he bought the whole thing and only did the dish himself. (sigh.. and he got 2nd), Well.. that`s life. The rest of the project are pretty sad to say "stupid" One team brough a aqurium, cd player and a machine then can give out the aroma of pandan. They claim that by lookink at the aquarium, listening to songs and the nice smell can reduce stress.. sigh.. i think i get extra stress living in that condition. lol.. The next team did something even more stupid. They build a desk that can be readjustable to your height. Come on man. This is an engineering project, do something that`s up to standard. sigh. Then the next did a "tudung salji" with a light bulb inside to keep the food warm. Well.. how useful is that. u judge it. Then got one more team do on a experiment to find out the concentration of ammonium in the enviroment. Looks pretty boring. they just distile the drain water and get the result. And the last team do a what they claim to be " a engineering project". He keep insisting that his`s a engineering project and all the rest is a science project. He did a pam. But when i ask him how did he do the pump. He told me he bought it. Sigh..that`s so embrassing.. He boast so much but all crap.  All the constestant were getting really bored. There`s really nothing today except for the results. Since every school have brought a laptop, you can see everybody is playing the space cadet pin ball.. I took my laptop and went to another`s team table. Then we played the game together. Haha..like a tournament. I`m proud to say again (ahem ahem) that i`m pretty ok in that game. use to play that game last time. So i beat him almost 10 times the score. Soon after, everybody`s like watching (cuz they were all bored and now there is something "cool" going on..hahaha. Then, the boaster, (the guy who keep on boasting) came and say he can beat my score. Well.. i do believe that ppl can beat my score anytime, but however since i`m the standing champion there... i challenge him for a game, He accepted it and we start playing. He boast so much but ended losing more than 10 times the score..hahaha..even worst tan the past players. And everybody`s watching.. I think he really got a big disgrace mark on his face. We didn`t talk to each other then..hehehe.  Yeah.. now the project`s over. I`m free to study.. Finally!! My test is right after the next day. i`m not so free after all. I try to do some last minute studys. Went online for a while only. I didn`t online for the past 2 days.. OMG.. never never in my life did i stayed at home and didn`t online. if you don`t believe. ask marcus!! he`s always online i`m sure he sees me online everytime except this 2 days. However. the test`s tomorrow. (ahh.i`m freaking out again) This is the least preparation i have made for a test/exam. All thanks to my project which took up loads of my time. Well.at least i got 3rd.. kinda worth it also. But the test tomorrow!!!!

      Ok.. now physics quiz is over. I`m bz with my stupid project again. The project is still far far away from completion and i have to finish it in 2 days time. I didn`t sleep on last day. I do my project the whole night, then in the school, then in the car and finally reach kl (where the project competition is going to be held) i`m still doing!! I just finish the minute the judges comes near. but it screwed up. Sigh.. all my effort and it screws up last minute. However. when the judge come. i began to crap. I`m proud to say that i do have the ablility to cover even a massive disaster with my speec..lol..Manage to convince the judges about how "impressive" is my project..hahaha. And guess what!! they didn`t even realised that my project has gone wrong a bit!!  Finaly the judging is over. I can sleep in peace. I reach home at 5.30. Took my bath and slept until the next morning which is 7.30am. I didn`t eat my dinner and worst of all!! i miss out my choir practice! Oh no!! Suppose to have a session on drum tonight. What a waste. i put the blame on my stupid alarm clock.Never been able to wake me up even though i swtich on 2 alarm clock in my room. And my mom insisting that i should sleep cuz i didn`t sleep at all yesterday!! I`m so upset when i woke up tomorrow morning. But at least i have a long sleep. Slept for an amazing 13 hours!! Cool!!
