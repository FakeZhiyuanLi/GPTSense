      hahaha......  i stole this because i liked it.......  love, like war is easy to start but hard to end......  it is so true.  just got back from ryans. had sex and shit, gave lots of hickies tonight. thats just because i'm a whore. don't want to work today. i have to wake up in 11 hours, what a crime. ryan makes me cry. wayne tries to rape me. he made me pinky swear him sex, and i of course couldn't resist. shane likes giner. adam has pretty glasses. scott wears a retainer. joey has a gigantic penis (lainie is one lucky girl). zach is a little too into the cure. yo tengo tres gatos. me llama antonio... yeah right. i don't want school to start. its slowly creeping up and its going to suck wayne's saggy balls when it starts.  :( sad face for school.  gerrrrrrrrrrrrrate. great. damn, i'm tired.  i want my first black cock.

       So i've been thinking. Blogs are pretty pointless... well, for me it is. i don't post about anything worth looking at, so why continue? i don't think anyone really needs to know what i'm thinking about. let alone care. so this is goodnight, have a wonderful life.     A Song For The Moment      This place rings with echoes of Lives once lived but now are lost Time spent wondering about tomorrow I don’t care if we lose it all tonight Up in flames, burning bright Warming the air of the world  “I don’t love you anymore” is all I remember you telling me Never have I felt so cold I have no more blood to bleed As my heart has been draining into the sea  Since I’ve taken your footsteps Getting me closer to what is left Of the dreams of what I once claimed to know Within my bones this resonates Boiling blood will circulate Could you tell me again what you did this for?  “I don’t love you anymore” is all I remember you telling me Never have I felt so cold I have no more blood to bleed As my heart has been draining into the sea  Still I wait With a hope inside of me (inside of me) So still (so still) I wait (I wait) Until again we meet Until again we meet  Within my bones this resonates Boiling blood will circulate Could you tell me again what you did this for?  “I don’t love you anymore” is all I remember you telling me Never have I felt so cold I have no more blood to bleed As my heart has been draining into the sea  Still I wait With a hope (so still) inside of me (I wait) So still (a hope) I wait (inside of me)  Rise Against -- Blood To Bleed

      ......i think i'm going to quit I house and work at the Rock. You see, the Rock will give me better hours during school so i'll still be able to do after school activities, i'll also get to work more days.  But at Little Italy, i get better money. Right now i'm working 3 nights a week for 4 hours a night making in between 7 and 15 dollars an hour. But also in the waitressing industry, its never steady pay, people are jack asses and stiff you of a tip a lot. SO i'm making on average about $90 a week including tips and paycheck. Not bad at all. But at the Italian House, i can't dye my hair, can't have any visable piercings either. At the Rock you can. I'm trying to make a decision. I think i'm going to quit I House...... tell me what you think.  Really bored. I don't know what to write about..... hm.... Ginnie left at 4 in the morning today to go to Montana for 2 weeks. It'll be lonely without my wife for a while. :'( tear. My birthday's in 10 days! exciting... finally going to be 16! yes i know, its not really that big of a deal, but still! I'M SO EXCITED! eeeee!  The knitting needles are waiting.

      I'm mid-d y ing right now. My scalp has a tingling sensation. The hair will be a golden brown, or so the box said.  So i've basicall y  wasted m y  da y  awa y  on stupid stuff. Let me tell  y ou, first i didn't wake up until 3ish-4ish, i don't reall y  remember, then i finished watching Donnie Darko. After that, i went upstairs grazed for a while, and then asked m y  sister to take me to the store. So i went to the store bought some hair d y e, and this is where  y ou find me now, waiting for it to be done. Ah, i have goosebumps, it's ver y  cold in m y  basement. I'm supposed to hang out with Ginnie ma y be when she gets off work, i don't know she said she'd call me. R y an keeps calling me and telling me what he's doing randoml y , but otherwise i haven't really talked to an y one toda y . I need to clean m y  room, it's reall y  mess y . I've noticed that an y one that finds out m y  age is suddenl y  turned off, because i'm onl y  15, it's reall y  funn y  to me. i have 8 minutes until i have to wash this smell y  shit out. do do do do do do do do do do. so cold. Can't wait until the Rise Against show on the 28th, i'm so excited! Ginnie and I were talking and we are thinking about going to the Underoath, The Bled, and Sensesfail on the 26th too. but not sure if its going to happen because we don't have the "bills." My mom asked me again today if i could get her speed. She creeps me out. I think she's hiding things from me. hahahahaha  Sorr y  for boring  y ou, have an excellent night  :)

       I love this song, and more than that i love the lyrics, so i figure i will share it with all of you that read my blog.       I'd burn alive to keep you warm when you're alone. Shiver under blankets in the basement where our secrets sleep. You pour the liquor on the staircase, girl. Pass the flask and close your eyes. Are you grieving for what we've become? Are you running from that room? We set the evidence on fire. We light cigarettes and chase out old regrets. Are you grieving for tonight? I smell the sulfur on her skin (breathe in). Yesterday will be the end of you and I. Yesterday will be the end of shoulders where we rest our head. Now we grieve for tomorrow goes on without us. Now we breathe for no one else. Everything is broken slowly sinking under waiting for tomorrow waiting for the grave to tell me that she's lonely. Open up and hold me slowly feel my body becoming one and only. Death is just an excuse to forget you. Now we run from ourselves. Hope lies not in the mirror. I'll burn alive for you.         -The Bled- Porcelein Hearts And Hammers For Teeth

      I'm bored. AH! Ryan and Wayne just left. haha i gave Ryan a hickey on his neck, it's a goodie. I tried to get Wayne but he wouldn't let me because of Thryn, damn Thryn... that and he wanted it on his inner thigh!... sick bastard. haha. wow, i have nothing to post about at all. i'm shocked because Zach Johnson didn't call me tonight. He broke our tradition of calling at 1:30 in the morning. Maybe he was calling other girls! :-0! Better not have been other wise i'd kick his ass.... well probably not because i wouldn't care, but i'd be a little sad that he broke our tradition :(. I have realized that i'm really lame, and that this post is a waste of space, but i will publish it anyways! I love my cat (Little Matt Skiba) shes the best cat in the world, and the only woman i need in my life. except Steph and Danielle, oh and Ginnie. I love Ginnie, shes the second only woman in my life. :) okay. i'm going to go now, because i just keep rambling.  Make a leaf pile, RAKE!

      I've realized something today.  When surfing the internet, time  flys  by.  And because of this I have no life.
