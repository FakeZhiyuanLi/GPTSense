      blah blah bliddey bliddey blah blah blah.  such a good mood.  lifes pretty neat sometimes.  my friends are all miserable, my daddy is being more protective than ever, and my mommy doesn't like me very much, but im okay with all of it.  i keep feeling like im still in florida, just laying on the white sand, soaking up the endless sun.  warm.  happy.  perfect.

      boys are such odd creatures.  it would seem that if one likes you, then suddenly they all like you.  it's either all or nothing.  for the longest time it seemed that the entire population of males strongly disliked me, but now it would seem that quite a few think im pretty cool.  why is that?  is there some secret meeting where they all get together and decide on the flavor of the month?  grr.  they're rather confusing.  i think that spring is the instinctual mating season, so now everyone feels the need to couple up, but even so, there must be more to it than that.  I refuse to believe that my actions are dictated by hormones and weather.

      I hate this constant feeling of discontentment.  I can no longer feel satisfied unless there is tons of drama and chaos everywhere.  But then if there's lots of shit happening I feel equally horrible cause im all stressed out.  Theres just no winning.  I don't feel like writing.  just too drained right now.

      i saw someone today who i hadn't seen in ages.  it made me so angry.  this person is someone that i was very good friends with for a long time.  then she left, and changed, and became this fake bitch.  i cant stand her now.  all the stories of wild parties and drug busts bore me with their stereotypicl characteristics.  "so and so got outta jail and now he's gonna go beat up so and so cause he owes him money."  i dont care.  and all of this information is presented with this incredibly fake ghetto accent.  almost something you might hear from a horrible sopranos mock.  and at the same time it's mixed with this touch of country hick.  my blood boils just thinking about it.  why do ppl do that?  no one else in her area really sounds like that, so i know it's not a mistaken accent that she picked up from the scum she claims to be "chillin wit"  GRR.  so fake.  i know most ppl might see this as a rather hypocritical statement, many belive that i pretend to be some huge ditz, but thats actually a real part of my pesonality.  i change from day to day.  i act like a ditz when i dont want to deal with life anymore.  however, i do not TRY to be a ditz.  i act how i feel.  there's a difference.  i just dont know what to think about all of this.

      This school had GOT to learn how to mind it's own bussiness.  My goodness!  People care so much about things that don't involve them at all!  I'm bringing my best friend to prom.  I love her, and I'm not sure what I would do without her, we can make anything fun.  I really believe that prom would suck if she wasn't there.  But apparently my choice of date has pissed a rather large number of people off.  Why?  I honestly don't get it.  It's okay for robert to bring his freshman girlfriend, but I can't bring mine?  That's somewhat hypocritical.  And worst of all, it appears that some think that I'm doing it just to spite them, if anything, it's the opposite.  I was going to bring a guy from another school, but I suspected that people would make fun of him and talk about him, which isn't what I want.  GR!  There's simply no way to win this particular battle.

      i love the way things seem to just fall in place.  i just had an unbelievibly shitty weekend, and then, today was wonderful.  everything sorta got fixed all at once, and it was really nice.  I'm just so happy about it.  I really hope things stay like this for a little while.  I also talked, well, tried to talk to my mom for the first time in many weeks.  Granted it was to ask for my clothes back, but hey, it's better than nothing, right?  i'm pretty sure im never gonna get to see my old wardrobe again.  It makes me sad.  It's going to sound really fruity, but I had a very personal connection with my clothing.  After years and years of time spent together we seemed to fit eachother just right.  That sort of relationship can't be established with brand new, storebought, mass produced items.  It takes time and love and good laundry detergent.  I really do miss my old stuff.  grr.  i sound so rediculously materialistic.

      A real torture would be to build a sparkling cage with two way mirrors and steel bars.  In there would be good-looking and young girls who'll think they're in a regular motel room so they'll take their clothes off and do the delicate things that girls do when they're alone.  Everyone who watches will go crazy because they won't believe what they're seeing but they'll see the bars and know they can't get in, and they'll be afraid to make a move because they don't want to scare the girls away from the delicious things they're doing.                                     -Jenny Holzer

      I've realized that you can spend your whole life fighting the evil in the world.  You can try your hardest to stick up for what you believe in.  But no matter what, eventually you WILL lose.  sure, you can be honorable.  fight the big fight.  honestly though, why bother?  You'll just be waisting precious time.

      It's finnaly raining.  Raining for me.  My tears have been waiting to be released.  And now they flow freely.  Dropping down from the beautiful clouds washing away all the sin and injustice.  Things are just okay.  Time is standing still.  And for the first time in weeks, I can just be.  I'm here, sitting, watching the rain, hoping to let go of my soul, and watch quietly as it glides out of my body, and joins the endless sky.  It's all together.  We're all part of this, this complete perfection.  I am the rain.  I'm floating down from the clouds, keeping a close watch over all that I love.  Removed and yet totally connected.

      Music is the most amazing fucking thing EVER.  A good song comes on, and suddenly I'm out of my seat dancing around the fucking office like some retard.  I'm the SHIT.  Nothing can touch me.  I'm unstoppable.  Arnold Schwartzineggar (spelling!) doesn't stand a chance, cause I'm JUBEE, the amazing RETARD!!  wow.  bipolar much?  I'm feeling like such a independent feminist right now.  I don't need ANYONE, so ya'll can just kiss my ass.  that's right.  you heard correct.  BITE ME.

      The strange thing is that I used to feel so sorry for those poor bums who made the same mistakes continuously.  They make the same decisions and each time expect different results.  I'm one of them.  One of those desolute pathetic saps.  I keep giving the same person chance after chance to change.  They keep claiming that this time "really will be different."  But it never is.  It never will be.  Then what keeps me from making different choices?  I don't understand.  If he can't change, then how is it possible for me to change?  Perhaps it was meant to be.  Maybe we were both meant to be in a terrible relationship that we hate.  Maybe this is my punishment for past lives ill spent.  I'm begining to suspect that it is.

      There are certain people who radiate happiness.  I love them.  Those are the individuals that I live for.  The precious few that I can be stupid and immature and just plain weird around, and they love it, they completely understand and dont think less of me for it.  I need more friends that I can have simple fun with.  The type of fun you have in wallmart at three in the morning on a tuesday night while wearing your pjs.  Innocent, simple, perfect.  Playing with the massive bouncy balls and riding the tricycles at 90mph down isle 14782.  And without a doubt there will be some hula-hoop fun.  Greatest invention in the world.  agh.  nazi father....must get off computer for no apparent reason except for the endless power trips and pointless battles for control.  Welcome to the life of a fucking teenager.

      I've been searching for the author of this song for several years now, and just recently i found it (thank god for launch).  this is probably my favorite song of all time, and the strange part, is that it's not even that good.  I thought I would post it anyway, just incase I forget who it was by and need to find out.    I hate the world today  You're so good to me  I know but I can't change  Tried to tell you but you looked at me like maybe  I'm an angel underneath, innocent and sweet  Yesterday I cried  You must have been relieved to see the softer side  I can understand how you'd be so confused  I don't envy you  I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one   I'm a bitch  I'm a lover  I'm a child  I'm a mother  I'm a sinner  I'm a saint  I do not feel ashamed  I'm your hell  I'm your dream  I'm nothing in between  You know you wouldn't want it any way   So take me as I am  This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man  Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous  And I'm going to extremes  Tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing   Chorus   Just when you thing you got me figured out  The season's already changin'  I think it's cool you do whatcha do and don't try to save me   Chorus   I'm a bitch  I'm a tease  I'm a goddess on my knees  When you're hurt  When you suffer  I'm your angel undercover  I've been numb  I'm revived  Can't say I'm not alive  You know I wouldn't want it any other way

      i think im becoming rather selfish.  It's starting to bother me more and more that i'm expected to spend a certain amount of time each day being social and helping others feel good about themselves.  a little part of me is screaming "what about me???"  It's a horrid little cycle really, cause i feel good about myself when i make otehr ppl happy, but if im unhappy i cannot effetively make others happy, therefore i become more unhappy as a result of previously mentioned failure...and then it's just bad and overly complicated.  i need a BREAK.  i wonder if i could run away for a couple days and then come back acting like nothin happened.  teehee.  my parents would probably throw me into the pavilion and pump me full of drugs.  i feel kinda like a prisoner.  nooo.  stereotypical teenage statement.  DAMN ME.  no more of this writing bussiness.  i dont like the way i sound.

      i can't be happy....grrrr.  i've been trying so hard today, but nevertheless, i keep crying.  and each time i cry i just feel really stupid and girly.  specially casue im crying bout really dumb shit.  for example, today i started crying in the middle of dairy queen in front of a whole shit load of ppl cause i realized that i was busy both day and night untill next tuesday.  i was then told that next tuesday would be spent getting my license, which completely pushed me over the edge.  so i'm hysterical in the middle of a DQ crowd that's trying to enjoy their family time and ice cream.  rather pathetic eh?  i guess im just so exhausted that i can't take it anymore.  I desperately need one night where i can sit and do nothing, an evening where the most strenuous activity i partake in consists of painting my toenails.  but instead i must be busy, CONSTANTLY.  at this point, im looking forward to school and finally being able to slow down and take a break.  apparently tho, school is gonna be just as bad.  im doing softball, and ill be doing admissions forms, and my boss wants me to continue working nights and weekends.  when will it end???  and i can't sleep anymore :(  maybe thats the worst part.  when i try to sleep i just have nightmeres.  i think the best rest i've gotten all week occured last night when my boyfriend was over.  i completely passed out while we we're watchin a movie together.  i felt really bad about it, but at the same time, he made me feel safe...i wasn't scared to sleep.  i've been told several times now that i only love him cause he loves me, and for awhile i was really scared that it might be true.  but there's so much more to it than that.  he makes me remember how it felt to be a little kid, all curled up in my daddy's lap.  nothing could touch me or hurt me, i was protected from the evils of the world.  damn me!  im sounding mushy again.  this must be stopped immediately.

      I've decided that my personality is just one giant contradiction.  Things that i love about myself i seem to hate about others.  For example, I love that my personality constantly changes.  My attitude, even the way i dress, can swing from one end of the spectrum to the other in a matter of minutes.  It makes me unpredictable, exctiting, and it gives me the freedom to act how i want, when i want.  It's like being different people.  yet i can't stand it when other ppl do it.  I hate it when others aren't consistent and stable.  why is that?  it makes me feel like such a hypocrite.

      gggggeeeeROWL :)  i wish i could make that smiley face much larger, and also much prettier....but nooooo....i can't do that on icky blogger, so poo on you.  im in such a damn fine mood.  i got to see my borfriend who i looooove.  i dunno, it's strange, at first i really didn't want to see him, i just wanted to sit around my house all bymyself.  but once i actually saw him and chilled with him for awhile, i began to wonder how i had ever managed without him.  I never been in a relationship like this.  He makes me so damn happy.  as he might say, it's fuckin recockulous mang.  i simply love being in love.  agh!  i sound like those faggots that i used to hate!!  what on earth has happened to anti-relationship josie???

      i feel lonesome and dont know why.  i'm certainly not alone, at least not in the technical sense, but i feel all disconnected.  stupid teenage years.  grrr.  i can be in a room full of people who i know and love, and somehow still manage to feel desperatly isolated.  why is that?  it rarely makes me unhappy....it's certainly not a sad sort of emotion, just discontent...not as happy as i could be.  it's probably insecurity.  im not comfortable socializing because i cannot admit to myself that perhaps i'm an okay person to be around.  (i apologize for that horribly constructed sentence, but im currently unable to be more eloquent)  anywho, i generally spend most of my time in social settings just wondering what ppl really think of me.  I'm convinecd that they're secretly plotting ways to destroy me and making a list of all the things they hate about me.  although i must admit, i am unsure who "they" are.  perhaps simply the collective world?  i am alone and the world is my enemy?  a sad perspective, yet startlingly accurate.  grr....i feel icky

      i had the strangest night last night.  it was fucking perfect.  well....okay, maybe not perfect, but certainly one of the best nights i've ever had.  i've never felt that content in my entire life.  i must admit, the first part of the evening did suck ass...afterall i was meeting andrew's parents, and that's never really a fun experience, but i think the initial suckiness made the second half of the evening so much better.  it was just so simple and sweet and calm and lovely and god damn i'm still happy from it.  grrr.  teehee.  you know, i was reading over my blog entries a few minutes ago, and i realized that im always either really happy or really sad.  i appear rather bipolar actually.  i wonder if this journal is an acurate depiction of my moods, or if i'm simple more dramatic when i write, therefore everythign appears more extreme then it really is.  i'm bored.
