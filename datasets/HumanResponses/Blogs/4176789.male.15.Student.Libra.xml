       Read Trlblzr's blog. [No doubt that's how you got here.]  I know how ya feel. And that wretched wumpus! Hehe, text adventures. My brothers played one many years ago, and it took them forever to figure out that they first had to tell their character to wake up [or get out of bed, or whatever] It was something about a window washer or something, I don't really remember. Good times. Finally read a review for DOOM3. Woah. Truthfully, I can barely play DOOM  without getting scared out of my pants. Google zdaemon game launcher. It comes standard with DOOM1. 00 ~ I don't why,  but there's DOOM, DOOM1, AND DOOM2, everybody but me has DOOM2. poop. And it's pretty much the only way you'll ever be able to play against other people.  -I need a girlfriend...

       DOOM 3. That's weird. I could go to wal-mart and hug the game that's be hyped for the last 4 years. That fact still hasn't sunk in.  -It's only a dollar.

       I'm so confused. No doubt if you got here, it's from trlblzrdom. Pudding sounds good. But did we really need the question marks? Indeed, the drumline isn't doing to good since Dr. Spud left. We're doing alright, but not good enough to justify being dorks [look it up] all the time. People are just always making jokes about stuff, and at the most inapropriate time. All I can say is, kuso.  -ithinkineedanewkeyboard

       I really wish I had a lot of money. Then I would buy stuff. All the time. My car wasn't starting. I added water to the battery, and jumped it, started right away. And now it's also very clean, and squeaky (trust me, I tested that) Nothing much else to say. Band camp starts again tomorrow.  -Surrounded by liars killers, and the number 7...i wish  [inside joke]

       Yay! For some reason I really like it. If you don't know what it is, and you have broadband, (or 5 hours to waste) google it. It's really cool. And speaking of cool, I missed my cartoons last nite, that is not cool. And no, I didn't say that it would be did I? Anyway, I missed ep. 18 of GUNDAM SEED, and and ep. of YU YU HAKUSHO. CURSES! Oh well. I'll find a review of them somewhere. Speakinf of fish, bob it probably hungry, I kept forgetting to feed him on time...well, it's more like, i haven't been home to feed him. Oh well, he's still alive.  -...

       Well poop. We finally have a day off (sunday) and I have to go to church. True I get to "sleep in" but not as long as I want. Tomorrow is the last day for the people that we hired to help us with our show. Yay! Things may be a little easier for us. Boo! I hope that we don't start doing bad again after they leave. That's really all I have to say....  -Chocolate pie!

       Well, band camp was horrible. And i can't find any ROMS for MAME. And i have dialup, it takes forever to download anything.  And apparently, Strikers 1945, what i really want, is impossible to find for free >_ But metal slug 3 is another good one, so I'm still looking for that. sigh...

       Band camp started today. Indeed, quoting nate, nazi camp. grrr, i wouldn't mind it so much, but we don't have stands for our drums yet, and those things are freakin heavy. and on top of that, we wore 'em for many many hours. >_  -From Tattooine with a swirly pink hat

       Well crap. Band camp starts tomorrow. I wouldn't mind so much, but i have to mow yards, to make money. And i won't be able to for the next couple weeks. Oh well, band camp is fun, it's just very demanding. HALF-LIFE 2 has me really hyped. Physics based puzzles, destructible environs [ie- set a building on fire with a flame thrower (or blow out a support with a grenade) and the whole thing will eventually burn/come crashing down. Awesome.] Of course, it is a game, not a simulator to show off awesome stuff.[but it does that too, very well] No doubt you'll be too busy leading/joining a rebellion to have very much fun with all the cool features. Now I'm not saying you'll never be able to, at the start of the game, and between missions/objective/or whatever they're called, you'll have plenty of time for fun. Man, band camp has me all depressed, I came back from a week vacation to my grandma's and today was my last day for fun, and i had to mow, and I can't get on the internet all the time (curse you dialup!) so I didn't really have time to do what I wanted (frag people and talk them to insanity with my new mic) oh well.    And speaking of a microphone, I wish I had a not evil dog.  -Speelers of the world untie!

          WELL HELLO! I'm new, and now i can post my thoughts. I'll try to be coherent if i ever get into a blind fury, but don't count your eggs before they are chickens. Anyway, i'll voice my opinions, and if you don't like it, comment, unless you think that i said Nintendo made the playstation. (See trblzrdom) You'll notice that i capitilized Nintendo, and not playstation, I'm a hardcore Nintendo fan, and it's not that i don't like the ps2, or the   xbox, it's just that computers are better. Hehe, I'm more hardcore about computer games, than i am nintendo mostly because of the release of DOOM 3! www.doom3.com That's really weird, it's been hyped for the last 3 or 4 years now, and now we can actually play it. w00t! I'll never get to play it though, Cube (open source fps) scared the pants off of me, google it. But if i did get it, it would be for the multiplayer, and that's only if it had bots. And also speaking of DOOM 3, (I'm quoting my good friend trlblzr here) "DOOM 3 is a status symbol[or whatever term he used], if someone asks you how good your computer is, and you respond, 'it can run doom3', you'll no doubt get some respect." Indeed.  -Methusula
