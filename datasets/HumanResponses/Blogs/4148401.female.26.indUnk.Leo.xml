       The weekend was so gorgeous.  The weather was perfect.  I made the best out of what wasn't so perfect on Saturday.  It's not so bad being alone.  It's nice having someone to share things with all of the time, but I needed some space.  I suppose I am just desperate for attention...

       A night at Sangria in Royal Oak...  It's been a long time since I have been out dancing.  It was a lot of fun.  It was especially fun when guys would try to dance with me or hit on me and I could flash my diamond ring at them.  My husband wasn't very happy to see what I was wearing when I went out with the girls, but I reminded him of what he put on my finger.  He didn't think it would matter, but if he only knew how the guys responded.  Only one didn't care very much, but it wasn't a problem.  I wish I could go out dancing more often.  It is such a great release and a great workout.  I made it very clear that there was no arguing about me going out tonight with a new group of friends.  It's new for both husband and I, but I must say, it was a worth it.  It's not like anything really that significant happened...I just really love to dance and I'm good at it.  There is one thing that was significant.  One of the girls that went out with us has always been pretty cold towards me.  She is my co-workers wife.  Even though I had the impression that she didn't like me, I never let it get to me.  I knew I was being misjudged.  Sure enough, she came up to me and started talking to me, (after her 2nd drink) and the entire night she was just so shocked to see how cool I was.  At the end of the night she kept telling me that we really need to get together and that she "fucked up."  I take it that she was admitting to me, in her own way, that she had misjudged me.  So, I think I made a new friend.  I hope that we will go out again.  I can tell that we both have the same problem with having girlfriends though.  It's hard making new friends...especially girlfriends.

        It's a nice Friday today.  The office is quiet, there isn't much work to do and it's beautiful outside.  I wish I had a window in this office.  I am not sure if I am looking forward to this weekend or not.  I have potential plans for this evening, but am afraid that I won't be able to go out.  I don't get out much.  I don't have many friends nearby, so there is no life outside of my marriage.  Should there be life outside of marriage?  I should still be an individual, but that could be seen as dangerous.

        This is my first post on my blog.  Interesting.  I'm excited to expand on this idea.  I suppose I should decide what I should use this as.  Maybe as my imaginary friend.  There are times at work when I end up sharing my thoughts with my co-workers and regret it as soon as I do.  I can't tell you how many times I have wished that I had a true friend here to listen to me instead of whispering to my co-worker.  Let alone how many times I wished that I didn't have to listen to her.  Yikes...it's tough sometimes.  I really enjoy her and have learned a lot, but being that we are at work, makes the friendship side of things very difficult.  We'll see what happens...
