      My Dad called me today.&nbsp; He lives in Ohio, where I grew up.&nbsp; There is a family butcher shop that our family frequented, the owner has 1 son and 2 daughters.&nbsp; I went to school with one of the daughters.&nbsp; The owner passed on a few years ago and left the shop to his son to run.&nbsp; Earlier this week, the son, age 49, passed away.&nbsp; The shop is closed and probably will not open again.&nbsp; The son failed to plan.   I have posted on this on the GCA board awhile back but this has hit closer to home and is once again tickling an uncomfortable spot in my mind.   How many of you have a standing disaster plan for your business?&nbsp; Is there a locked away black book for your company?&nbsp; Does it list all the contacts?&nbsp; How about your passwords for your different computer functions? Sites? Programs?   How does your successors contact your customers?&nbsp; What do they tell them?&nbsp; Can your company continue to run without you?&nbsp; For how long?&nbsp; Is there a signed power of attorney for your successor?   I realize nobody likes to think about this, but it is something just as important as the day to day operations of your business.   Enough morbidity for now.&nbsp; Don't just read this folks, set it up, put it in place and let someone know where it is.&nbsp; Do it once and then at least you know it's there.

      What is the best, non-cleaning tool you have ever purchased for your company.&nbsp;&nbsp; Computers are disqualified from this.&nbsp; I am talking about a tool you purchased specifically for your company to use in your business.  Mine?&nbsp; My Dremel!&nbsp; We mark everything L & K, from mop handles, brooms to buckets, the wringers, buffers in 3 spots, extractors, etc....&nbsp; I have worked for too many firms where every time I go into an account something was missing.&nbsp; Watched thousand's and thousand's of company money being spent on replacing "missing" items.&nbsp;   I don't have that problem,&nbsp; we engrave everything with the Dremel and fill in the engraving with white, black or blazing orange paint stick!  What about smart employees?&nbsp; I have a team leader who is worth her weight in gold.&nbsp; We have an account where it is open 24 hrs a day and it seems like every single day, spray bottles, rags, etc.. would be missing from the carts.&nbsp;   About 2 months ago, the orders at this account were cut in half.&nbsp; Being curious, at the next team meeting I asked the leader where she was hiding the chemicals since the 'borrowing' issue seems to have dissappeared.&nbsp; She told me that she is not hiding anything anywhere and that the reduction was due to her new sign.  In the closet, hanging front and center off the shelf was a computer printed sign that simply said, "Caution--these chemicals have been shown to cause impotence in men and hair loss in women".  Problem solved!  How about you folks?&nbsp; have any nominations for tools or employees?&nbsp; send them to me at  urlLink ken@cleanpeers.com  and we will get them posted in our mailbag.

      Everyone by now has seen all the books, pamphlets, cd's etc... That advertise "&nbsp;how you too can get rich in the cleaning business!"&nbsp; Other than the authors of these books and maybe the publishers does anyone currently in the industry really believe this gunk?  &nbsp;  I pity the poor start up entrepreneur&nbsp;who sees these adds, spends the $39-$49-$69 bucks only to get some cheap little booklet that tells them to start by selling to their neighbors, friends and family.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's almost like a pyramid scheme without the meetings in someone's basement.  &nbsp;  Don't get me wrong you can be successful and financially stable owning and operating a cleaning business, but it takes hard work, long hours, sacrifice of time, family etc... To achieve those goals.&nbsp; It does not come overnight and certainly not with running a newspaper ad in the local paper!  &nbsp;  Over the past few years I have been fortunate to interact with many small service business owners, some who took the time to do adequate research, properly insured and licensed and today they are small, thriving concerns.&nbsp; Others, that just jumped into the field, broom in hand, well, the emails I send just bounce back now.  &nbsp;  What's everyone else think about the business and your potential for success and realizing your dreams?  Email me:&nbsp;  urlLink ken@cleanpeers.com  and your response will be in the next letters to the editor columns.

      Well the much planned for, highly publicized, sometime controversial, definitely fun Cleaners Convention in Chicago, 2004 has come and gone. Unbelieveable that I can take 3 days off and then spend the next 7 trying to catch up!  To all those who attended, thank you! Your participation made all the efforts worthwhile. The presenters from within our group all did an outstanding job and I know opened quite a few eyes a lot wider with the  New and Innovative ideas  that were presented!  (Steve--you got them all talking about you!)  The professional presenters were equally outstanding. Bringing us information and extremely helpful tools to make our jobs go a little smoother. They all deserve our thanks for taking time from their personal lives to come and talk to us on a Sunday!  I will get complete article coverage up for the front page of Cleanpeers,  urlLink www.cleanpeers.com , this weekend but I doubt that it will cover all the behind the scenes activities that went on. Things like standing out in front of the hotel on Friday evening playing guess the cleaner, adding tables to the Saturday night dinner party so it went from one end of restaurant to the other, avoiding the wedding party drunks in the lobby and watching to see who was going to rub Harry's head next!.  It was great meeting everyone and look forward to many more of these conferences.
