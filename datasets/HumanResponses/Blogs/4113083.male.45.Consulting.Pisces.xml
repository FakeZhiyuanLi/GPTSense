      The rigors of professional blogging are not well documented. Long hours spent thinking of something meaningful to say, the endless typing, the yearning to be heard above the incessant and mindless media chatter. But hey, thats why we expect to get the big bucks. After much thought I have an interesting question to pose - who are the people that actually read blogs ?

      Well here I am - my first official Blog post. Pretty exciting and seems like a good thing to do considering I have no job and my prospects for getting a good paying job don't look good. Can you get paid for having a Blog ? Is there a way to make money "blogging" ? If you create a Blog and no one reads it, do you really have a Blog ? Would people pay to watch "blogging" ? What if you had a competition - a "blog off" ? If you told someone to "blog off" would they be offended ? If blogging was around when Seinfeld was on who would be the "blogger" ? Kramer, George, Newman, Elaine or Jerry ? Would Kramerica have been the first successfull independent blogging company ?  At this point all I have is questions............  As a professional "blogger" I believe I should outline what the difference is between a professional and amateur blogger. A Professional Blogger sees blogging as their only job possibility. All they think about is blogging, 24/7. Without a Blog they have nothing !  Here are excerpts from a recent interview with the jobless blogger.  Interviewer: It's a thrill to finally meet a true professional blogger. How did you get into blogging?  jobless blogger: Thanks. It is something that comes naturally to me. I have all the ingredients that a pro blogger needs; a computer, the internet, I can type and I have no other job.  Interviewer: What's the most difficult aspect about be a professional blogger ?  jobless blogger: I get asked that question alot. I guess maintaining my professional status. IF I do end up getting a job I will have to go back to being an amateur blogger.  Interviewer: How many professional bloggers are there today ?  jobless blogger: Over the past few years the ranks of the professional bloggers has really grown. I believe we can attribute that growth to the strength of our economy.  Interviewer: Any advice for aspiring professional bloggers ?  jobless blogger: Yes...do not just jump into this profession. Its a "blog eat blog" world out there.  Interviewer: Any final comments ?  jobless blogger: My ultimate objective is to become a symbol and spokesperson for all the professional bloggers out there. We deserve national recognition and want to reach all the unblogged masses with our message - without a Blog you must have a job !
