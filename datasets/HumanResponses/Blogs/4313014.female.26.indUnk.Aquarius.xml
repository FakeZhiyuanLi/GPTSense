      so my friend nick asked a question in his comments to my previous post, making me realize that this blogging thing might be a good idea after all! love the questions, will answer with more questions, maybe never reach an answer, and enjoy the process...  he asked "is there unique purpose for each person (aka vocation in the philosophical sense) or is there general purpose (aka love) for everyone expressed uniquely through the grid of a persons unique style and abilities?"  here's my thought that serves as a foundation: it's a both/and kind of thing (how many of you saw that one comming? ;-) because we are  all  created in god's image, it is only natural that we have a general purpose, aka love. god is love and as his creatures, we long for it, we look for it, and we want to express it - that we go about it in different ways is another long subject we're not getting into right now.  that love, as nick questions and proposes, is expressed through the uniqueness of every human being. that expression is what i would call vocation. this vocation is not static but ever evolving. this isn't something that you find once in your lifetime and then you have it all "figured out". vocation, like everything else in life, is then a process of self-discovery: as you get to know yourself, you get to know god. as you get to know god, you get to know how he created you to express the love she lavishes on you.  the foundation is love. dynamic vocation flows out of it. it might not be "vocation" as mainstream evangelical christianity refers to. nonetheless, it is vocation.  this is the reality i find myself in. as i try to identify what is the next tangible step in my life, i keep finding out more and more that i'm fully called to be a vessel of his love. my vocation keeps being redefined, but the core of love is non-changing even when my understanding of love is ever-changing.  those are some thoughts... let me know what you think.

       i'm not one to follow trends... i usually rebel against the status quo, sometimes erring on the side of rebelling for the sake of rebelling.      so why am i starting a blog now that it seems to be the "thing" to do?      if you know me, you know that 75% of my world and my life probably happens in my head. this, i figured, would be a great way to let my brain talk, to process ideas, thougths, to give my brain a little freedom - and maybe interact with other great thinkers along the way...      maybe it will work, maybe it won't... who knows if i'll keep up with it... all i know is that it seems like a great idea now... so, as i'm learning to live in the moment, let the adventure begin.
