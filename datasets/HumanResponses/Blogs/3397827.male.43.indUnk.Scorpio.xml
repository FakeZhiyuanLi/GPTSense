Yes, the caption on his photo does read.... Son of Winky and (whoever)... Grandson of Bubber and (somebody)...

      I recently obtained a 78rpm record of Julius La Rosa singing "Eh Cumpari". You know how it goes... "Eh, Cumpari... something, something.. rhymes with 'pari'...". Well anyway, that rekkid had me going nuts with it going through my head...with no idea of the actual lyrics... so I looked it up online and found this great site... urlLink Lyrics To Italian Folksongs  and while I don't recognize 95% of the tunes on this list.. I did FINALLY get lyrics to "Eh Cumpari" so now I can jones in peace.

      ...before we were so rudely interrupted... It's nice to be back online with a blog. An experiment... much lighter than my other blogs have been. The world has enough heavy stuff to deal with, my blog need not add to it. But... well, who knows, huh?

      I've been thinking a lot in the past few days about a situation we seem to have in our country... It does concern me that our nation has fragmented, shattered like Humpty Dumpty and who can put us back together again? I suppose it being an election year it makes me think of this even more because modern politics, from my present vantage point anyway, seems to be less about bringing people together and more about dividing us into teams as if it were some huge political Superbowl... a game. It's an Us versus Them mentality that ultimately robs the country. It robs the world of a united American voice and it steals from ourselves the possibility of effecting real change here in our nation. It's a well-known strategy in war that a divided enemy is as good as conquered. We certainly are a divided nation, divided and subdivided and splintered into so many "teams" that we seem to have forgotten that change comes via a unified voice. I once passed a church that had a sign out from that said "THE SECOND CIVIL WAR : THE FIGHT FOR MORALS IN AMERICA" and I understood their viewpoint, religious fundamentalists do tend to see things in black and white and their theology is laced with the terminology of war, conquest and kingdom.  But really... was that sign too far off? In many ways I think it is not. We are bickering internally with our neighbors, seeing them as a political or social label rather than as a fellow countryman who has to pay the same gasoline cost, the same grocery bill and has to somehow put it together in his or her mind as to how to cope with it all. We are all just trying to find answers, folks... that's all. A quick listen to talk radio is all it takes to see this polarization, this dividing into factions.. this labelling.  I am writing this to remind myself that no one is fully contained by a label.  Labelling is lazy thinking and allows me to not see you as a person but as a series of preconceptions.... a word pretty damned close to the word prejudice, isn't it? Hmmmmm.... I can sit here and think I am so fair in regards to racial issues. That my generation is somehow better than ones gone before because we don't have (or, in reality..see) the rampant racism of former generations.... But I allow social/political prejudice to freely reign in my thoughts. I hear Democrat and I reach a conclusion about you... I hear Republican and I think I know all about you. But I don't. To think I can judge you by a label with absolutely no context to your life is little different from looking at a person's skin and thinking I know anything at all about them. My point.. .I suppose... if there is one... is to be a reminder that united we stand and divided we fall. I'd like to be a contributor to unity rather than division. But you know something...? This is all theory. I have no idea how to live this stuff out. I guess I have to trust that with understanding... if it is true understanding... comes action... and when the time is right the action is made clearer. All I can do is trust the process, right? It's all any of us can do. Thanks for listening. As always, agreement is optional, but thinking for yourself is essential.

      At the local thrift shop they have an extremely good deal. Every now and then when books pile up in their stock, they clear things out by offering them for a dime each. By Salvation Army standards this is an extreme bargain. Most SA's price through some amazingly complex system according to cover price...or is it date of printing...factoring in whether it's aa hard or soft cover book and probably the moon phase.  I appreciate that the local shop simplifies things by charging .75 for hardcover, .50 for softcover. Well, except when these great dime-apiece sales are on.  So my routine is to circumnavigate the store, clothes are in the middle.. low priority.. I look first at the large bric-a-brac rack on the left...it is occasionally worthwhile... I then move on to the back... I see the book rack but I build up to it... one must in these matters... I can usually tell from halfway across the building if much has been added to it... but i usually peruse the back rack first... the deeper bric-a-brac rack... the stuff near the sorting room, things get put here first. But, being this close to new books, perhaps...hmmm.. tubs of new unsorted books laid out at the end of the wall?  hmmmm.... steps hasten, but then philosophy kicks in to slow one down, why rush? Had I hit one more light in Jackson, I would have gotten here 5 minutes later anyway, so what's the difference?  All this to say that apparently someone has gotten rid of their Southern History books lately, fascinating books on slavery, the development of the new South, and the formation of both Black and White Southern mindsets. As an outsider, I find these topics interesting and look forward to gaining some understanding or at least some historical perspective. For ten cents per book, I just cannot go wrong.  So for today, I am looking through  urlLink The Most Southern Place on Earth: The Mississippi Delta and the Roots of Regional Identity  by James C. Cobb.

      Calm down..... calm down... it's a blog called  urlLink My Secret Life As A Prostitute and it is shaping up to be a fascinating bit of writing by a woman who works as an escort.  It's another reason the internet and blogging is so interesting, how else would you get such a look into another's life. Well, there are TV shows that talk about just about everything these days, but in a blog YOU control the output, how and what your readers see. In a TV show you are edited to suit the show's needs.  I'd write more but I gotta get back to reading this blog.

      I was reading comedian  urlLink  John Pinette's Website  today and saw that this was the day he did an update. He mentions that he's taping a DVD in August and then is going from there directly into rehearsals for the touring company of  urlLink Hairspray . Well, we are stoked here. One of the Hairspray tours plays Atlanta next February, hopefully it will be his.  It's gotta be better than the person playing Edna Turnblad now on broadway.... urlLink Michael McKean ...well, I'll temper that by saying I haven't seen him in the role, or heard anything about his performances in the musical till today...and, I have liked all his other stuff.

      It's a sand rubbing from an Iraqi tombstone. Creepy , huh? How it got from there to Jackson, Georgia is probably a story, isn't it? By the way, along with that gravestone rubbing, I also snatched up 4 original watercolors from Iraq / Iran that look to be at least 40 years old.  Also found a sealed Skilcraft "visible man" model kit, you remember them, the skin is clear plastic and you can see all the bones and guts and everything...and a few books.  All in all a good haul.

       urlLink Newborn Opry  is a place I first heard about on a Saturday morning listening to the old time gospel show on WJGA, the local radio station. The announcer kept pronouncing it as "Newburn" and said there was a website...dubya dubya dubya newburnopry dot com. Well, I was lost, looking for New Burn, New Bern , etc. I finally came across a link to Newborn, GA and there it was, the opry. I have not been to it yet, but it looks like a hootin' hollerin' place. It's great that, across the South you can still find city halls and other places that will host bluegrass, gospel or country music performances. I even saw a poster for an all-night gospel singin' here recently. These are things I have only heard about. I hope to get out to see a few of these one day.

      I had an interesting small-town experience this week. It was the early evening and our doorbell rang. Out here that's a unique experience in itself. The cats scattered appropriately, causing eleven little tripping hazards on the way to the door.  When I got there, a man was standing there with a sheaf of papers in his hand. He introduced himself as Alton Jester and said he was running for the local Board Of Education. I told him that of all the politicians I have been seeing signs for here locally he was the first to actually be out meeting the people. And that alone already put him in the running in my mind. He handed me a xeroxed flyer and explained that when he had the paper printed up the person he had do it for him asked him what they should write on it. He said that they should just write what they think of him as a candidate.  So I knew he was a brave man.  He handed me the flyer and it was short and to the point, saying that he was dedicated, dependable and a man of the people.  Now listen, I don't know much more about the man then what I am writing here. I have seen his signs occasionally in the neighborhood, much less so than his opponents. But I give the guy a huge hunk of credit for making the rounds. Meeting his potential constituents and leaving a good impression. He was in a workshirt from a construction company, it was obvious he had just gotten off the job only a few hours before. The man looked busy but still he was here.  So..can my vote be had if you will just meet me? Not always... but it does make me think twice when I see your name on the ballot. I have a breathing person association with the name now.   I know, I live in a small town in a small county. But these little things are what makes life out here special.  Mr. Alton Jester , good luck in the upcoming election. People like yourself at the grassroots level give me hope for politics.

      ... judge the country by an AOL "Current Events" chatroom....but if these rooms are any indication of how we'd communicate with each other if we were assured there would be no repurcussions and we can leave just by clicking a button, things are in pretty sad shape. I mean it's Jerry Springer-esque in it's mean-spirited pointlessness. The pattern I see is these combatants using words, phrases and tones that sound like half-remembered things they saw on TV somewhere. I mean, seriously, has anyone ever gone into a chat room like this and decided they were wrong because they were out-argued or insulted into it? What I see is things rapidly falling to LCD (lowest common denominator). But then if it wasn't for the LCD, there wouldn't be an AOL, would there. And I speak as an AOLer... one who is considering another ISP tho....

      ...it's been an odd week. Maybe the blog reflects it, I am not sure. Here what's happening. Next week I am going up to Atlanta and will be going to Emory clinic. They have one of the country's best neurology departments.  In case you are a reader who didn't know, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease two or three years ago. My going to Emory is because a new neurologist I am seeing went to school there and would like me to get a work-up from them and then a recommendation on how to proceed with treatment. There is talk of possibly  urlLink Doing Brain Surgery , and, in all honesty I am really scared of that happening. I mean this is the brain we are talking about here, you know?  The central command...headquarters...where it all comes from. Anything goes wrong and I am screwed. There's something else. I am in denial of the illness in very real ways. I don't read much about it or seek information. I think that to do that fixates my mind on it and makes it real-er in some way. I don't communicate with others with Parkinson's (PD) because seeing others shows me what's in store for me. I'm not sure I can handle that just yet. But damn. I'm only 43 you know? This wasn't supposed to happen. At least not yet.  I feel too young to be losing body functions like fine motor skills in my left hand. I'm too self-conscious a person to have a disease that makes me occasionally shake and I can't make it stop. I deal with enough inner shame in my life not to have my body adding to it, you know? Just too young to have my body already betraying me. I know... I know... it can be shown that there are plenty of people, even younger than me, far far worse off. I know that. But I gotta process this for me too. I need to work through how I deal with this. And yes, the "why me" thing needs to be brought up and dealt with. So it's been an odd week.  Next week I need to acknowledge my dragon, and find answers on how to best deal with it. I'd really prefer not to go and can give you a long list of things that really need to be done instead of running up to town and losing a day. But I think the regret over not actively trying to find answers would outweigh the temporary hassle of making the trip up there. Sorry... no silliness in this entry. But I'll work on it and try to be more entertaining next time. Anyway. I'll keep you posted. Thanks for listening, okay?

So gee, I can post directly into the blog via the blogger site, via email and even by telephone for audio entries.  I guess I better come up with something to say then, huh? I mean the site provides enough venues to get your words out there.  When I read blogs, I find entries I call "blogging about your blog" to be extremely boring.   So I'll cut this entry short.

      Everyone probably recognizes the above phrase, that it contains all the letters of the alphabet at least once. This morning I learned that this is called a Pangram. I also learned that it is not a perfect pangram because it uses letters more than once, like the word "the" is used twice. Although most 26 letter perfect pangrams do not make much sense, here's one that was the most clear of the list they had:   Mr. Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few lynx.

      The title of this post is also the title of the song going through my head this morning. It's a song by Ladysmith Black Mambazo. It was one of those songs that I woke up with. But it's a pleasant song playing on my internal radio so no complaints at all. If you are so inclined to want to hear the song for yourself,  urlLink There Is A Sample Here   it's under the first CD featured, Shaka Zulu, ninth song. We had some major rain here in Butts county this past weekend. So much so that my vegetable garden took a major hit, there is some damage to the corn and beans, a few tomato cages were knocked over. I'm hoping for the best, believing that these plants want to live at least as much as I want them to. So with a little help from me they should do fine. The majority anyway. A friend of mine from Minnesota, where they have had great rainings here of late also, sent me an article she found in the  urlLink Minnesota Gardening Forum  that was a response to complainta about the rain. being that the forum is probably not read too widely outside it's state, I'd like to share the letter here. i think it's beautifully stated.    Be still. Listen. Breathe in... deeply. Feel the rain, Hear the rhythm of the drops. Put on a poncho, sit on a garden stool and experience the staccato of drops on the hood.  Get down and look closely at your plants. They will never be this green and healthy no matter how much water you pump over them. Nothing can equal the greening power of natural rain. Use your visionary powers to see beneath the mulch and soil. Their root systems are growing wider and deeper each day because the rain lubricates the spaces between the particles of earth, and the hair rootlets feel no resistance.   Gardening is more than a hobby, more than an activity. It is a release for our stress. It provides a vehicle by which we leave our artificial offices behind and achieve a reattachment to the earth. Take this imposed opportunity to connect at a slower pace.   Smell the air. Try to discern between humus, perfume , cut grass and wet rocks. Odors attach easily to humid air, and humid air easily attaches to our olfactory receptors, so you will be able to truly smell your garden.   Feel the textures. A thin layer of moisture allows our fingers to more easily slide over a leaf's surface, making the heavily ribbed rhubarb and the delicate touch of lamb's ears more pronounced.   Look at colors. To make wood more beautiful, we coat it with polyurethane. To make a photograph more realistic in the brochure, we print it on glossy paper. The "wetness" of these treatments maximizes the color and intensity of details. So it is with your flowers if you will only look.   Finally, take off your shoes and socks and let your toes dig into moist bark, slide them through cool blades of grass, even (should we?) dunk them into mud puddles and squish the mud between your toes. Then stick them out straight and let the rain wash them off.   If you have trouble dealing with the fact that you can't get to all your projects, change the journey and make these things your projects. You will never look back and say, "What a wasted day. All I did was relax!"   If none of this works, stand looking out the window, mentally bemoaning how inconvenient the rain is, and then go watch tv. It will keep your mind off of all the things you "should" be accomplishing.   Mark   Here's a  urlLink Bit About The writer

       urlLink We Are Family  is a fascinating article on the Drag scene in Hawaii. What I found particularly of interest is the new forms of family units they are forming where several people live in a house under the care of a "mother". Maybe more so than in other gay communities, in Hawaii, drag queens are very central to local gay life. I suspect this is because the concept of the man living as a woman was not thought of as wholly unusual in the Hawaiian culture. As in other Native American cultures, gender wasn't thought of as a black and white male/female thing. In Hawaii, if a male showed that he was leaning toward life as a female he might be steered toward working with the women and living life among them. Well, of course, then Western Christianity came along and the rest, as they say, is history.

      I'll show you the two paint-by-number clown pictures later....maybe... and the raised-relief pig coffee mug...and the other stuff... but I just had to jump the gun here and show you this...   What you are gazing upon is a vintage Japanese import....Dachshund Teapot... you head me right the first time, friends and neighbors...his whole body is the teapot... his mouth is the spout. The back part near his tail is where you put the hot water or tea. On his back is a rack from which hang sugar and cream containers. The creamer is busted up and his tail has broken, but the pieces are all there and I can get glue.  It's astounding... who thought this up? A dog teapot. Kitsch in it's purest form. Of course, we had to have it.

      as we round the corner after seeing those Glads... we come upon   The impatiens bed. Mixed in with some Coleus, the colors are amazing together I think.   These are actually called New Guinea Impatiens. They look like little roses, especially these red ones.   This has to be the queen of the flower bed, a wizard's coat Coleus in bloom.   And an Acidanthera to finish things off in the garden tour for today. The Acidanthera is a relative of the Gladiolus and if you compare the layout of the petals you can see similarities.

      This is why, when Iget up in the morning, I get dressed and within 5 minutes am out walking through the gardens.   I was aware that the glads were starting to bud up, but I wasn't prepared for how beautiful they'd actually be. Literally took my breath away. So just indulge me on these glads, ok?   Aren't these spectacular?   That close-up came out far better than I ever expected!   Okay, I have more flower picture, but I'll save them for the next post.

      I found this  urlLink Fascinating Article On Mongolia  this morning. It seems they have a dilemma.  About 80 years ago in the attempt to break up the people's identification by clan (their own class system), the communists declared that surnames were to be done away with. So in Mongolia, people were all literally on a first name basis with each other. Well, Mongolia became a democracy in the mid 1990s and in 1997 a law was enacted requiring everyone to have a surname again.  The article was fascinating to me because of the problems the country is now facing in choosing surnames. Makes me think what I'd do in the situation. No remembrance of real family name and you are asked to choose one now. Wouldn't that make an interesting concept for a movie or story?

      I am trying to get my mind around the concept of control. I think I have been toying with this for years now, on and off, but finally am writing my thoughts down in the attempt to get some clarity. Who is in control? What is in control? Is anything in control? I think I fall easily into a childish mode in thinking that "they" will take care of us/me. Some vague parental figure that somehow keeps our nation afloat and will never let things get too bad... right? My mind easily rationalizes away outrage so that I believe that some cosmic control is behind the scenes, orchestrating things so they might get rough... but not as bad as in other countries... right? Or am I blinding myself, not willing to consider the possibility of chaos? Not willing to think of things as the wobbly tightrope it is? I live in my quiet rural enclave, far from outer chaos. Far from people out of control. I see the rhythms of nature and lull myself into the illusion that our human life is just as ordered. I am coming to the conclusion that the people at the wheel are incompetent and don't have our best interests in heart. They have sold us up the river. So what do I do with this conclusion? What do I do with my shattered illusion of parental control? I admit that the illusion needed shattering. But what to do now in rebuilding a world-view? I'm writing but I am not saying it nearly as clearly as I would like. It's frustrating. My fingers lag far behind my mind on typing this out.

He then forced her to drink a blue liquid. She said that after drinking the liquid she did not remember anything.

        1. Never lie, and never let anyone cause you to lie. Truth, or the pursuit of it, is all we have.  2. Never do anything you are ashamed of. If you're ashamed that means somewhere inside you think it’s wrong; and if you think it's wrong, you shouldn't be doing it.  3. Take full responsibility for yourself. You are the only one who can say what goes into or comes out of your body.  4. Ałways admit when you're wrong. You’ll save thousands in therapy later - and a few friendships too.  5. Change your mind as often as possible. Just because you thought something yesterday but you don't have to think it today. Don't ever become a prisoner of your own opinion.  6. Beware of anyone who says they know. Trust me, they don’t, or they wouldn't have to say they did.  7. Take care of yourself first, then your family, then your friends. And if you have anything left over, share it.  8. Do something, anything, evey day to change the world. It doesn't have to be big, it could be giving a dime to a street person, planting a flower, picking up litter. Anything will change the world.  9.When you have nothing better to do, smile. You'll have to trust me on the miracle this step.  10. Make a bit of time every day to be alone and think. Five or ten minutes is enough. It will keep you sane.  11. Have all the sex you want — safe sex. Get lust out of your way. It's the only way I know to make sure you fall in love for the right reasons. And I want you all to find true love.  12. Learn something new every day. Read a newspaper article that you wouldn't normally read. Open a dictionary to a word you never heard, or never understood.

       urlLink  FCC Media Ownership Rules Petition  is a petition that seeks to prevent media monopoly of markets. Big corporations are at work to push a law allowing one corporation to own three TV stations, 8 radio stations, and the monopoly newspaper in a single market.  I say "big corporations" but many do not know that religious broadcasters are behind this as well. They'd love nothing better than the ability to buy up most of the sources of information in your town. I could say that money talks... it will go through anyway, right? But this law that big business is pushing was just overturned on June 24.... it has been sent back to the FCC for "revision". Now is the time to at least stand and be counted as a voice against complete media monopoly. They might get what they wanted regardless, but it won't be because you sat back and said nothing.... I hope.

      You've probably seen all these, heck, you've most likely passed a few of these along... but here's a few blasts from the past... urlLink Classic Top Ten Lists :  "Top Ten ways to tell your car sucks 10...People behind you change lanes to keep your oil off their windshield  9...Tractor trailer drivers are afraid to pass you.  8...Opening your trunk includes finding a screwdriver.  7...Your driveway looks like an oil slick and the EPA cites you for it. 6...Your friends would rather walk or ride a bus to school or work than ride in it.  5...The motor is so loud you can't hear a dumptruck crash through a nitroglycerin factory.  4...You have ever had to leave it running for fear it might not start back up.  3...You have ever been chased down by a firetruck.  2...You refer to your car as beast, P.O.S. junker, or hooptee.  1...You have ever parked on the side of the road and someone stops and asks you if you are injured"

      Well it's been long enough... certainly getting warm enough... so last night I got a wild hair... as it were... and shaved my head and goatee and moustache off.  I'm not quite ready to go public with my new look... but I'll give you a visual to work with, mmmmkay?  Start with a bit of Uncle Fester     Add a few parts Sgt Garcia from the TV show "Zorro"     And now for a tincture of tenderness, but I must use only a touch... for without a touch of tenderness, he might destroy me... oops too much... (a prize to the first person who gets THAT reference....)  Of course my ex thought I resemble this next guy when I shaved my face and... well... it sort of defined the relationship, what can I say?

        What is that, you ask?  urlLink SmartKlamp: the fine art of male circumcision. :   "The SmartKlamp� is a new, one time use only, circumcision tool, which is designed to create, a safer, faster, and smarter way to perform circumcisions. The SmartKlamp� is a small plastic device, which workings can be compared with the umbilical cord clamp. It consists of a plastic transparent tube of polycarbonate, and a white clamping mechanism of nylon. It is very light and easy to use."  Disgust and involuntary male squirming... just another service we provide here at The Lalo Show

      The  urlLink Reverse Speech  website finds enough free time on their hands to look for secret messages in speeches ... get this...  if they are played in reverse . On the page highlighted above, the 2004 Democratic National Convention, played in reverse. But they need to tell you what to look for in advance because you'd never get "woork wark tiddle tiddle smark boon" to sound like "All rise to worship the anti-Christ... Michael Moore" without being prepped to look for it. Thank goodness there are people willing to sacrifice their time, effort and sanity to protect us like this.  Politicians say enough scary crap FORWARD, man...
