       yeah folks from now on I am officially one of the four-eyed freaks!!!! shocks is it really true? or am I dreaming? hehehe why am I making such a big deal about it? well anyway, anough about that last wednesday I got a big news... I got accepted for the varsity of the College of Science. Obviously, it is not volleyball but it's basketball. I was so happy that I let out a pretty loud shriek when Sir Nierra showed me the list. I just love Wednesdays!!! It always brings me such a good mood. Don't you just love Fridays? It is the last day of the week (actually school week) and I could get some decent sleep except for tonight, I guess, because I have a training tomorrow morning and it's going to be another exhausting day for me then on Sunday we will be having our exposure trip in Maragondon or at least I'm still hoping we could still come. NSTP sucks!!!! They scheduled our prelims on the same day of our exposure trip and unless they approve our petition to move that test, we have to choose between the two. Of course we have no choice but to pick the prelims because if we don't...we will fail! and who would want that right??? Anyway, I'm still waiting for Jean to come. Actually, we're here in netopia and as usual I have to check my NSTP account but unfortunately I haven't heard anything from my groupmates. Bummer!!!

       As you all know I am a fan of movies most especially the romantic-comedy type... I watched this with my little sister (actually she's not a little girl anymore, she has the same height as me!!! aaaahhhhh am i ever gonna grow??!!!) anyway, enough about my drama and let's proceed to my movie review of prince and me... I kinda liked the story. It will certainly give you that "kilig" factor that most especially the part when Eddie proposed to Julia Stiles (i'm sorry I forgot her name in the movie =) anyway, i could say it's stereotype because in the end they end up being together but the different thing about the story of this movie with the rest of the romantic-comedy genre is the situation of the girl. The cute thing about it, the prince was the one who was intimidated by the girl and the character of Julia Stiles did not leave the guy due to the heaven-and-earth, commoner-and-royalty difference, she left because she wanted to pursue her dreams. Well of course at first Eddie let her go and she went back to States but at the day of her graduation, he came and asked for a second chance because he is willing to wait. Well, as I said it turned out good. I could say that our 65 bucks is "kinda" worthit but... if I were you I'd wait it in the video to watch it. If you're the  hopeless romantic  (like muah!!!) well this movie is for you but for others who are looking for a deeper sense or meaning to this movie, you will not find it. Anyway, that's all folks and hope you liked my review. =)

      Here I am in the public library checking out my nstp module and the feeling just sucks!!!! big time! they are asking us to interview a member of the GK and i haven't gathered any infos about&nbsp;it and imagine this will be passed on friday! hell yeah this coming friday and it is laready wednesday so i'm craming right now and i don't know what to do... well enough about nstp, today is my favorite day! you know why??because most of the memorable things that happens to me occur during wednedays. so I'm kinda excited what this day holds for me.. maybe nothing!!!! haha =) honeslty speaking, I find my life mejo boring..no love life but I am still thankful because I have my family and friends to accompany my oh-so-miserable-and-boring life bwahaha =) This coming Saturday is the last try-out for the basketball varsity and I'm having doubts if I'll ever get in. Let's just say I don't trust myself that I could pull this off. The thing about me and basketball is I know "how" but I'm not really that "good" gets? Anyway, I have to go. I guess this is all for me today. I'll update you if anything "interesting" will happen to the life of yours and only Hannah Banana hehe =)

       Well here I am in the library wondering what I'll be 10 years from now? or least when I'm 20... I'm starting to feel a little old but I know that deep down inside this girl that people see in me, there's a kid playing around inside. It's my birthday and I feel good about it...because my friends remembered this special day and greeted me. Maybe they only remembered it because I reminded them days before that it is, in fact, birthday. But no matter how they remembered it, I still feel glad that they did. Maybe the reason why I reminded them is because I want to feel really really special at least fro one day. Birthday wish?? I dunno... I just want my father to have a decent and stable job right now. I haven't told this to anyone becasue I just want to keep it to myself. I feel sad about it because I know that a lot of people already took advantage of my father and he doesn't deserve that. He's a hardworking person and I want him to have a job where he'll definitely excel. Anyway, enough about it I might shed a tear if I keep talking about it. My birthday wish... actually wishes is (1) to have good grades for the whole year or maybe forever!!! haha =) (2) for my father to have a job (3) good health for me, my friends and definitely my family (4) for my brother to become mature man that he should be right now (5) last but not the least, a great guy who'll treat me right and love for who I am... but to tell you honestly my last wish can wait a little longer I don't want to speed things up with my love life. In fact, I'm happy being single. Just enjoying the company of my friends and family. Sometimes it's nice being alone but sometimes there comes a point in life where you want someone to be there. Guess I'm already in the middle of that situation. Anyway, I'm pretty bummed right now with test results in NSTP. Imagine 3 over 10...what a score!!??? Plus I need to report for my Philo Psych class... ha!!!  got to go!!! bye! wish me luck...Hope I'll have a "happy" birthday!!! =)

       Haaayyyy...I just can't get enough of Chad Michael Murray!!! What is it about this guy that makes girls, like me, go gaga over him?? Well for one, he's gorgeous and two, he's a really versatile actor and he's down-to-earth hehe feeling close!!! =) Anyway, yesterday we (me, Mian and Nikki) watched A Cinderella Story. I would rate it with 2.5 .... Guess it's just one of your typical Cinderella stories where Cindy girl or in this case Sam, played by Hilary Duff, is mistreated by her oh-so-evil stepmother and twin stepsisters. To tell you frankly, the only reason why I watched this movie is because of Chad Michael Murray... hehe =) I mean why the heck would I waste my money on a Hilary Duff movie?huh??!!! Anyway, I find the football field scene kinda cute. Austin (played by "my" hubbie, Chad Michael Murray) ran up to the bleachers and kissed Hilary then it suddenly rained for the first time in the movie since the setting of the story was summer and extremely drout and dry. For that one moment, I envied Hilary Duff..imagine she had a chance to kiss Chad! Hay... =) Of course, any remake of this fairy tale would always have a happy ending. They both ended up studying in Princeton and they finally found their true self. There was a slight modern twist in this remake but in my opinion it's still the same. I wouldn't recommend it for all people maybe if your a hoepless romantic type or plain Chad Murray fan then I'll give it a go but for people looking for something deeper...you'll never find it in this movie! For some people maybe you can wait it in video.

       I'm here sitiing in front of the pc wondering to myself why do care for him so much even though I know he doesn't care for me in any sort of way. I'm always a friend he could lean on but I don't know if he'll ever be like that towards me. Last night I found out that he told my friend that I'm stupid, actually not directly, he said that due to "my" mistake in the lab, where I accidentally fell the cover of the crucible and he got pissed because of it. Even I got pissed with his reaction but "I" thought that things were already ok between us since we're already "sort-of" talking inside the classroom. It never occur to me that he would say anything as rude as what I just heard from him but unfortunately he could. It truly got through me and I don't know why. Then just now we were talking through text and just like that I forgive him! I was even asking him if he's okay and I'm willing to listen to his problem but once again I'm not good enough so he made a fool out of me by making a false problem and, accorrding to my judgment, he actually finds it funny. But guess what?? IT"S NOT! I couldn't get myself to be angry with him, maybe because I'm scared of screwing things between us, I mean we are in the stage where friendship between us might actually happen (or at least I think it's possible) Anyway, I don't know how I should be with him I'm torn between the "mataray" cynic Hannah or the sweet, caring friend side of me. Ha! Why does it have to happen to me???   :c
