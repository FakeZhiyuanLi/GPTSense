      last night i flipped through "who wants to marry my dad" (nbc), "the casino" (fox), and "for love or money" (nbc).. (the latter two were on at the same time). so so bad  whatever happened to quality programming such as twin peaks, dr. katz, and models inc.??

      it's monday morning and i feel heavy and agitated.  overall good weekend, although there were some very low points.  friday night my labmates and i went to dinner at the  urlLink  brown sugar cafe   and i ate some angel hair noodles with tofu which was very salty and not very spicy.  later on that night tina, patrick and i went for a drink at  urlLink  grendel's den  , the place where i ran into yuming a year ago (+ change).  it was fun and we drank lots of herewizen (?), a beer from munich that patrick liked very much.  then i went home.  chris was waiting for me outside my house, woeful and concillatory.  i was cold and didn't want to deal with our issues.  i forced him to leave while ignoring everything he was trying to fix because i knew it wouldn't work and we wouldn't fix anything.  we had gotten into a fight earlier that day about The Move, and when i addressed everything in a nonconfrontational manner he decided to be unsupportive and unempathetic, thus provoking me to attack him on his relationships, us, our sex life, everything.  anyway when he came to apologize i was impassive and made him leave, before which we had just learned of someone being beaten to death with a baseball bat only two blocks away.  i don't know why i'm so cold sometimes, why i have to hurt the people i love and why i can't accept what love they want to give me.  i feel incredibly guilty over what happened but it was impossible for me to show any feeling about it.  chris stabbed into my chest with his finger yelling and calling me a psychopath, but i think psychopaths probably feel more than i can sometimes.  i keep thinking that if he loved me he wouldn't move in with soo jin but he just yells and says it's my fault that he's doing so, that in a way he's being forced into it.  i know that while i don't accept culpability for anything, he doesn't either.  i only feel my own pain in the wake of others, along with the absence of love.  that's it.  saturday night i went over and apologized to him after a day of hanging out with alex and baking pies and playing badminton.  we made up, and sunday the same fight happened again.  he told me that even if we didn't fight for a month (as he had promised) and moved in together, he wouldn't turn his back on The Move, which i felt was insulting and derogatory.  i don't know why it's so important for him to live with her, why doesn't he want to be with me.  why is he moving so far away?  the moment when he dumps on me to stay home and smoke pot and eat with her, i'm going to go crazy and he doesn't even understand that.  he doesn't understand that i need him to Show me that he loves me more, instead of yelling on about how i'm stupid and intolerant and a psychopath.  which is what happened yesterday, after which i hit him hard three times because he was laughing in my hysteria.  laughing that i was crying and screaming and uncontrollable.  i should never have hit him, but it was so cruel for him to laugh.  that will be the last time i see him.  anyway i went out with patrick for the rest of the day, which was lovely.  we hung around harvard and ate chocolate mousse at cafe pamplona (previously bad association) and watched farenheit 9/11 and talked.  i found the movie oversimplistic but funny and on-message in its points (i would prefer fewer antics and more facts, but so it goes).  i'm sad that patrick is leaving for germany because i like spending time with him very much, but he might be back in september.  what will be my marathon?  i have so much love to give.

      just kidding.  fight with chris today.  he feels professionally inadequate.  i feel personally inadequate.  i kind of went out of line but he _always_ favors soo jin over me, or so i feel.  he hates me and feels like i'm lying to him still, which i've stopped doing.  he thinks that because of brendan he has a trump card, thereby negating seven or so years of abuse.  it's crap.  okay joel is here now, more later

      i like my roommates very much but i have trouble sometimes since i feel like i do not live here, the space is not mine, i am imposing, and i am excluded from the community of married twentysomething/thirtysomething alcohol and pot.    i spent the day with chris.  it's so easy to get sucked into the relationship again when no ostensible problems arise, we're comfortable and miss each other, and know what the other is thinking ("what number am i thinking of:: three?:: OMG!"... bad example).  then things turn ugly, i hate his friends, he hates how i get, i cry and we quietly fight, i say sorry and then we kiss, he gets depressed, i cry some more, we're still, and then we kiss again.  last night i went to patrick's bbq (with his labmates, none of whom i knew) and i brought alex.  alex is really fun and cool and despite our occasional awkwardness, i think he's interesting and charming.  he's going to brazil next year. and then i stayed up too late, and woke up to clean.

      i don't think zoloft actually works for me, i've been spending $20/mo on it and i think my meetings with marcia are bullshit except that it's actually nice to talk to someone who listens, even if she's paid.  the medicine is more for a placebo effect and an imposition of moderation in my life.  one good thing about it (aside from getting drunk entirely too quickly, which is more a bad thing) is my decreased libido.  libido and sexuality has been such an integral part of who i am and how i interact with people, and now that it's decreased (which, still fluctuates; i've regained my ability to orgasm although it can still be frustrating) i feel like things are much simpler.  regarding what chris wrote about me, i do fear that i'll never be able to have a completely honest relationship (similar to mai-lan style) but as long as i don't act on those feelings, i should be okay.  repression was always the end of me...  re: mailan, i hope she's happy whatever she's doing.  it's easy to poke fun of her, but i see bits of myself in the way she was.  my limmerick about her:  there once was a girl named mailan who loved each and every man she so wanted a pal and once there was hal away to st. louis she ran  ps.  i too seem to love each and every man, at least at some point.

      really strange dreams last night.  caution; explicit.   there were three but they seem to run together    1  chris and i are fighting about his apartment with soo jin in JP.  i keep seeing images of them sitting on lawn chairs laying out as a representation of their apartment.  we fight constantly about it and there is a "village voice" store (in this case it's a organic food store) next door to their property.  the property is laid out like a cemetary.  i go inside and try to be friendly to soo jin sometimes but still express unhappiness about the whole thing.  anything chris eats around me i sneer "is that from the village voice," unhappily.  i get poison ivy from walking around his park/backyard too much.  soo jin eats sunflower seeds and chris complains that they need more salt.  i say she's a horrible cook and has no taste.    2  shopping for stuff for kim's wedding, in this cool retro store with lots of neat colored glasses with blues and yellows bunched together.  kind of a boring dream.  i try on lots of retro clothes in a [transformed] hotel-like space with irene and iwaine sung in the room.    3  the interesting dream.  i don't know where it begins, i only see vignettes of events in it.  i'll try to piece it together.    first im in a shoe store with pooya and i see an entire rack of shoes for $10.  previously we were walking in the store and i was talking to him about his classmates and how he'll spend time with them, and he was asking me about good places to go in the area and my recommendations.  i recommend northampton, portland (maine), new york.  anyway so we find the shoe rack and i go crazy in looking for shoes... the sizes on the rack i was looking on ranged from 8.5 to 14.  i find several pairs that i like - running shoes that look like minem, red leather mary janes that had a patch on the front, black pumps, etc.  i kept trying shoes on and look over at emilie fillon for approval but she won't say anything to me.  i decide to buy a lot but never actually check out.    walking down somewhere and i see gunther and his daughter (both overweight, the latter has enormous breasts).  i start talking to them and ask gunther's daughter if i can fondle/licking her breasts.  she consents and i proceed to fondle them.  a known person (who shall remain nameless*) sneaks up behind me and proceeds to perform oral sex on me while i do this.  i start doing this on gunther's daughter and start going down on her as well.  nameless* comes around from behind me (after i orgasm) and we start concentrating on gunther's daughter.  she has a penis, and while i'm fingering her (unsatisfactoriliy) nameless * puts a condom on her and i expect her to have intercourse. instead, nameless* says "walk over to that streetlamp with this shawl" and proceeds to pull out a camera to take photos.  nameless* instructs me to do the same with a metal streetlight and we continue to pose.  i look down from the large hill/plateau we're on and i see johnny and feel an enormous sense of deja vu.  i call out to him "johnny, i've been here and seen you here before," and he's with a darkhaired girl with curly hair.  he nods and keeps walking as other people gather and point and gossip.  i see another boy on the plateau who looks/talks like dallas peavy and i call out to him "you're the boy in elephant," and he said "yeah, but i'm from california," and he walks away.    the rest of the dream feels like a huge deja vu episode (not in real life, but in the dream itself).  somehow i end up in "seventh heaven" which is really the eleventh circle of hell.  it appears to be a large museum which has on display [in real life] famous people and the ways they most fear dying.  this includes falling from the sky (to remanifest later), being eaten by animals, rot, being lost in the woods, small projectiles, nastily ballooning full of fat, really vivid things but i can't really remember.  [i wish i could remember more as several were really funny, this was the greatest part of the dream.]  we leave the museum and see more of these episodes happen as we walk around.  i'm scared but i don't admit it.  i look into the sky and i see one of these episodes a man ballooned from fat falling from the sky in a big wrapped around parachute that does no good.  everyone screams and tries to duck, and i run into this big runner-type notch int he large hill we're on for safety.  the body turns out to be the father of a person i'm with (different people) and she's sick with grief.  some of my clothes fall down the runner into the body.  i encourage her to go to the body and get over her fears.  we go down there and move the body, which is surprisingly light.  we open up the bag and numerous feminine lingere products are inside, with shoes (some of the same pairs from earlier in the store), and clothing.  we fight over the lingere that i know is mine.  people are standing around and staring at us.    ----------------  commentary  i don't know where 3 came from.  maybe ballooning full of fat came from me thinking yesterday [in lab] about injecting myself with dmf?    why shoes?    chris and i are done for good.  it makes me really fucking sad.  i tried so hard but he couldn't do the things that he knew he needed to do.  he thinks i want to put him in jail.  he doesn't see that he made a choice.

      see below   urlLink    dancer's pose&nbsp; urlLink     dream: i was in atlanta and was attending some conference and was being negligent to all my pets, including my pet horse, which never got to go outside and lived in the basement.  i screamed at my mother at how awful she was and in a huff i left to the movie theater, where chris was.  he followed me and we fought, i hit him hard, and suddenly we were in a tube station and i was running and he wouldn't leave me alone, i was begging for help from the bystanders and he was forcing me down and hitting me while i tried to dodge.  we entered the tube station into a small compartment and once we passed tower bridge, i wanted to get off (i also looked for the nonexistant skyscraping bridge over london which wasn't visible).  the car turned into a bus, and while on it i screamed at him that he stood me up and never called while he was out with genevieve, and he had all her things with him- food, shoes, magazines, photographs.  i tore the photograph that was signed to him by her and threw it out the window along with some of her shoes, and he responded that those belonged to his cousin.  i asked the people behind us where a good place to shop in london was and they responded with the cambridge port saloon, at which i thought (to myself)- oh my, what a coincidence!  anyway we got off the bus and i was looking for schafer house where i used to live, near tottenham court road, and then i ran into another transport station and was then in asia.  i was forced to fight ninjas (okay maybe they weren't ninjas but that's the closest descriptor i can come up with) with large wooden spoons and knives and scissors.  an fong was there, and in front of her i killed a girl and fled.

      i woke up very late because of MV fatigue so i didn't go around with hal and tina to see the reading of the declaration of independence and the sailing of the USS constitution.  i did make it however to the picnic that my lab had and the fireworks that proceeded.  we had a nice spot on memorial drive along the charles and ate pasta salad, greek salad, various meat (not me), bread, cheese, chips, pie, cake.  i think hal won the dessert contest but it's because i didn't make a peach pie and pie > cake.  the concert at the esplanade was headlined by BON JOVI and we listened to it on the radio.  after that fireworks display, alex and i concluded that we're down with america.  for the time being anyway.  photos below.   urlLink    picnic&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    boston&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    matt is nuts, hyuntae likes gcms&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    alex and me&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    fireworks&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    another&nbsp; urlLink

      i'm sad tonight.  i know it's terrible but every time my mom calls i think there's a problem at home, in particular with my parents' health.  i'm so paranoid right now that there will be some mishap with the house construction since my dad is physically stressed the entire day, and only three months before he would take two hour naps midday and just read the paper.  in addition, my mom had an abnormal EKG a few years ago and a bad medical history- anemia, heart murmurs, uterine cancer.  it's difficult having older parents.  frank betty and i are throwing this 70th birthday party for my dad, and it's difficult to think of it as a celebration.  a celebration that he's lived that long?  what about my apprehension that he'll get sick?    on a happier note, this is a photo of the tong addition:   urlLink    tong addition&nbsp; urlLink

      i feel bad.  no more craigslist for a while it's so addictive to know what people think of you physically, and worrisome.   i [apparently] would make a good man, like i always knew i should have been.  does nobody else feel eerily familiar with middlesex?  the section when she figures out she's a hermaphrodite (after having sex with The Object's brother in the cabin in the woods) and starts having sex with TO?  and gets run over by a tractor while chasing after said brother, and goes to the hospital? it gives me deja vu.    watched lord of the flies tonight.  spiderman 2 yesterday, which was fantastic and campy and dark.  im in love with the peter parkers of the world, it's not nerdy, it's fucking hot. i looked for chris's roommate jeff in lord of the flies but didn't see him.  the jeff who was a male model from montana, came out, and had big rubbery lips.  i remember everything.

      "yes, t-shirts are for guys, only...and even on guys they are only acceptable at 90°F!  there is nothing worse what a women can do than wearing t-shirts; why not wear a garbidge (sic) bag"

      title:  am i pretty??? post:  i have a low self-esteem. email me and i'll send you a picture, and you give me your honest opinion.  when requested, my email and attached photos: okay i have attached two photos please let me know and whether you like my hair longer or shorter thanks   urlLink    long hair&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    short hair&nbsp; urlLink     responses thus far: Honestly, I don't find you pretty.  I think you look better with the longer hair though.  You could probably fix yourself up so you'd look fairly decent with some work.   why do you have low self esteem? beauty is in the confidence that oozes out of you.  Its tough to say in those pictures.  the head and shoulder sizes are fine.  The chin is little squarely for a girl.  The elbow area tells me you are not overweight and will not be. The edge of the nose could be sharper.  The neck could be longer and less fleshy.  Face size and eyes and others are proportionate.  Teeth are fine. Small chests.  Short hair makes you look like a boy.  the lips could be thicker but that's my preference.  Can't see the back or the waist or the ankles or the wrists: all very important aspects of femine body. I wouldn't say you are beautiful or pretty in traditional sense.  You are cute and it is in your smile that you can charm others.  Your narrow glasses make your eyes look smaller.  Try some other type or contacs.  ...you look cute enough to me :)   I have a fair sence of beauty. I'm sure like most women you aren't giving yourself enough credit. just because you're 15 pounds over weight doesn't mean that men won't throw themselves at your feet.   ur not pretty. you look like a boy..try changing your style, putting on some makeup, and letting your hair grow out. sorry hun  Not a model, but hen who is.  You have a very nice smile and warm eyes.   I thought I was going to have to make something up or be really diplomatic but you are someone who would totally catch my eye if we passed eachother by on the street.  what size breasts do you have?  you look like a smaller B  I'm a lesbian and this may sound stupid...but I think lot of girls would hit on you with the shorter hair...most likely because they think you swung their way if you know what I mean ;)   From what I see you look to be a natural beauty with genuine character. That dazzling smile doesn't hurt either Miss.  You have a huge smile.  Not just with  your mouth but with your eyes  anyway ..  you seem like a nice person.  I don't want to be stereotypical in either respect, but on Asian women, either looks good. I mean its the absolute BLACK color of your hair that is astounding. It is the shine and way that light reflects off of it....  Shorter looks better, but in either case I think you'd benefit from a nice, expensive cut. Just walk in to a real good salon and tell 'em to do what's right.  Finally, t-shirts are for guys. Dress up, and don't be afraid of your curves. Embrace them, and soon enough guys will want to embrace them.

      as an effort to meet new people, i have posted ads on craigslist.  yesterday i posted an ad for a new boyfriend (and an ad for someone to teach me illustrator, but that's not interesting enough).  it read:  title:  be my boyfriend and i will make you pies and cakes post:  somewhat neurotic recently emotionally-scarred girl wants to meet an interesting guy to hang out with in her spare time. you must be intelligent, fun, affectionate, and reassuring about my insecurities. in return, i promise you good anecdotes, delicious meals (including pies and cakes), and friendship. thank you.  responses i have received:  I am 23 and from Holbrook. I am going to college for history and I am also a pro wrestler. I have been wrestling for around 6 years (including backyard wrestling) and last November I was in my first live show in front of an audience. I enjoy talking on the phone, watching movies, going out, eating dinner out, and cuddling up with that someone (if I ever find her). I am 5'3 with blond highlights and natural dark brown hair, and hazel eyes. If I sound interesting to you, email me back, we can talk online or the phone sometime. If you get to know me, hopefully you will see my randomness. I also have a puppet (a real one, not a sex term in this case)  My name is Dave. I am 30 from Quincy, Ma and single. I am looking for someone nice, fun and open-minded to meet that is also tired of the games drama and dating scene. I am also an affectionate person and like the same quality amongst others in a woman. Write back when you have a chance.  that sounds awsome :) tell me more (I'm 23m/boston/smart~150IQ)  I am a chef so pies sound great.....I love pies....if your still interested in getting together send a reply here is my pic ...I also have a cam if you dont like the pic  I can be your friend if you make apple or pumklin pies.  Tired of cooking for everyone else for a change.  I have a big house with large kitchen.  Hello...   Pie is my weakness...cake not so much..."somewhat neurotic recently emotionally-scarred girl" huh? We sound very similar you know. Except your a woman and im a man...It took 7 operations to get there, but now im up and running... Seriously though, iv read cragslist for years (Its amazing) and bought my bicycle w craigs but have never had the desire to respond to one of these ads. I am needing to meet a few people other than work friends. I thought your ad was funny...anyway...Im sure your going to get a million responses to your ad and im unsure of how to make my response stand out...  Anyway, im 29 white guy 5'10 and cool as a cucumber... what do you look like? what kind of person are you? Send a pic if you want...Ill send one back(if i can make this friggin' camera work), its not required though...        Ben.... P.S. Im a Bartender/Restaurant manager sometimes screw up!!! Lets get some coffee or go see spiderman or something.  hi there; i went over you ad and i can tell you are so honest and sweet, i am interested to get to know you as friends if that all what you wanna. here is my info: 27y/o, single male,6'3 tall, green eyes, black hair and olive skin by the way i live in cambirdge too, if this is sound good feel free to e mail. at :    .  thanks.

      it's been a long time since i've used this.  ever since chris started reading it (and we broke up...got back together...and broke up) i've been hesitant to share my feelings or be honest.  and i don't care anymore; if he's hurt, he deserves it.  the last fight we had, the police and the fire department came, and he completely forgot events the way they actually happened.  i hate him.  anyway.  i don't know how to take compliments.  give me tips?
