When I looked closer, weird rants had been painted all over the concrete too. I have no idea what all this means or what it's about, but most of the content seems to be about travel, God and pop music.  Highway to heaven, I don't know, but it was interesting.

I felt guilty for laughing at this site (it's the Catholic in all of us), but this made me a little misty for the days I grew up with Shan's "Wrestle-Me Jesus" and Tarbox's "Jesus Playing Soccer" painting.  This page in particular cracked me up (see above):  "Imagine this one gracing your mantle, right next to the outdated Sears family portrait. This statue has got just about as much class as a mimosa made with Tang.   The nameless chap (or chick) who sent this one in writes, "Found in Chinese store in Arizona. Answers question: 'What do Jesus, Richard Pryor, and Michael Jackson all have in common?' Their heads have been on fire."   Interesting comment, I suppose. It also leads us to ask another more rhetorical question: When is a statue small enough to be a statuette and which would this be considered? Or is it just crap?   Oh yeah, and one more question: Since when was Jesus known to wield a Snickers bar in His right hand?"

Even though I am going on my sixth (whoa!) year here in Bloomington, this was my first Lotus, and I had such an amazing time. Being there and seeing how much people in this town cultivate the arts and value culture made me feel like I am definitely better off for having spent some of my life in Bloomington. The music was really wonderful too. I have to say my favorite show was done by the  urlLink Mahotella Queens , a group of three women from South Africa who have been performing since 1964. Even though they are all about 60, they perform with so much energy!  Another bonus was that Jennie Nye came down for a visit on Saturday night. It was so much fun to spend time with her and catch up. We went to a great Lotus after party, and a lot of the musicians showed up to talk and play. There was impromptu music everywhere; in the living room and on the rooftop.   Some schoolmates on Friday night:

How weird.  Alison, I thought you'd appreciate that.  Speaking of someone who hails from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, England, UK...  I just bumped into Emmy award winning  urlLink Tyne Daly .  Um, okay, so it wasn't that exciting, but she did get into her new black Chrysler Sebring convertible (no one drives those out here, hell does anyone?) chomping on what looked like a long Misty 110 ciggy.  Wow.  Classy with a capital K.   I was a bit intimidated by her, and thought it best to keep the Emmy congrats to myself as I didn't want her to go all Cagney and Lacey on my ass.  Whatever happened to Sharon Gless?

It's bad enough when I find a transaction on my bank statement that I didn't make, but it's worse when I report it to the bank that they fail to tell me they'll be cancelling my card.  So depositing two checks , and getting money for the weekend didn't happen this morning.  Apparently someone pumped $35 worth of gas at some gas station in North Hollywood on a Monday during the workday.  My car can only hold $20 worth of gas when the gas prices are sky high, I was at work that Monday, and I don't ever go to North Hollywood.  It's creepy, as I have no idea how someone could've gotten my info.  Hopefully it was just a computer glitch on  urlLink WaMu's  part.    Mom's latest tip on keeping your credit/debit card number safe :  When signing your receipts at a restaurant, be sure to take your copy, but also scratch out your credit card number on the restaurant's copy before leaving it on the table.  Your card has already been run through the computer, and there's no use for it after that.  Thanks Mom!  I'm headed to the premiere of the Coen Brothers' " urlLink Intolerable Cruelty " tomorrow night.  It's also a wrap party for their latest film remake which finished today, " urlLink The Ladykillers ," starring Tom Hanks.  My friend Jenny (another IU alum) who works on all the Brothers Coen films invited me, so it should be a rip roarin' good time.  The dress is Hollywood casual, and I still have no clue what that means.  I've lived out here for over a year now, and I think I can still count the number of clothes I've purchased on two hands... maybe even one.  I'd really love to see Hanks and Clooney in the flesh, and maybe casually elbow Catherine Zeta in the boob.  That, or I could show her my stylin' T-Mobile phone.  Never really been that big a fan of hers.   Hopefully this will be a good networking night for me, as I'm out of work around Halloween time.  :(   Treasure your steady jobs, kids.

       Time:  Earlier today.  Place:  the red line train at Wilson Ave.  Incident:  As I was leaving the car, I passed a rather rotund gentleman who was singing at the top of his lungs, "pass the chicken!" in a very melodic fashion. He repeated this little ditty as long as I was in earshot.   This immediately recalled another experience I have had with random chicken-stuff. Last year when I was walking to work, I was approached by a man with a bag, who got very close to me and said, "I have chicken for sale. Real good chicken. Any piece you want." He opened a scummy looking bag to reveal an assortment of fried chicken. I said no thanks and went on my merry way. He called after me, "You're missing out! I have good chicken!!"   So, yeah, not much else is going on in my life right now, so chicken is the highlight of my day (that and eating really good spaghetti.)   Over and Out.  &emailalert=no&email=adgrant@indiana.edu&url=http://closeproximity.blogspot.com&name=Proximity&bgcolor=003399&fcolor=FFFFFF&link=FFFFCC&words=comments&title=Comments &width=350&height=350">

I'd have to say I love/hate movies with the cop duo where one partner is old, tired and is on his last mission before he retires and the other is a fiesty renegade with something to prove. It's always better when's there's an annoying Joe Pesci ("Oh gawd!") sidekick around for laughs. See Seven as well. Oooh! And I hate it when scenes in movies always have wet streets at night even though the preceding day was beautiful. You hear the swoosh of cars and see their red tail lights reflected in the slick pavement. Meaningful stuff. I think the funniest post on this thread is the "Billowing Curtains of Egress" where the cops burst in and all that's left in the hotel/bath/bed room are the white curtians blowing in front of an open window. What cliches drive you crazy?

      Hello from the land of justin timberlake and way way too much web surfing.  I got rid of my cable tv last week which in turn has led to a lack of TV.  period.  I dont get local channels either.  I think its best this way.  Im going to the clinic outpatient now, so things are looking up.  Im reading, listening to the radio; Im finally cleaning the house.  I'm happier.  That stills leaves me with plenty of time to surf the web endlessly as i am doing right now.  I really do need to wind down after the rousing game of mini golf i had with jeremy and paul and john. ...and peter paul and mary.  Its pretty cold here.  If only i had a bob evans that i could duck into for a warm, breaded oriental chicken salad, since thats what i crave in the winter.  Alas there is no bob evans in colorado.  I've only seen ONE waffle house and it was near the airport so thats sort of nonmansland type territory and can't really be considered colorado.  There was a perkins, but it was torn down.  In its place was built an eating establishment with a leprechan as mascot.  or maybe it was a denny's.  either way, why did they bother?   &emailalert=no&email=adgrant@indiana.edu&url=http://closeproximity.blogspot.com&name=Proximity&bgcolor=003399&fcolor=FFFFFF&link=FFFFCC&words=comments&title=Comments &width=350&height=350">

Today I had a lunch meeting at  urlLink Bob Evans . This is the first time I have not eaten breakfast there with my grandparents at the one near the Indianapolis airport. In case you were wondering, ok I know you weren't, I had the Oriental chicken salad. Not bad, but only in Indiana or at Bob Evans, which is basically transplanted Indiana, can you even imagine anything "Oriental" being breaded. *Sigh* Such is my glamorous life.

Last weekend was packed full of fun things.  My Aunt Deirdre from Boston is in town on a photo shoot, and my Uncle Pete and 7-month-old cousin Aidan came along to chill for the week. urlLink poohpj.jpg   I'm babysitting him on Sunday, so I'm hoping all of my big sister/diaper changing/bottle warming techniques come back.  Pete, Aidan, and I strolled over to the Santa Monica Pier where Red Bull was holding their annual  urlLink Flugtag  event.  A gazillion people were there watching these groups of people launch their weirdly engineered contraptions off the Pier in hopes that it'll fly.  Most designs were top-heavy and immediately nosedived into the Pacific.  Still fun to watch though.    I also went with some friends to  urlLink "The Animation Show"  at the Regent Theatre in Hollywood.  So much of animation seems filmic these days!  It showcased a lot of Mike Judge and  urlLink Don Hertzfeldt's  older work.  Don's "Rejected" is still my fave.  Very funny.  It's coming to a theatre near you.  I've been getting some good use out of my longboard lately.  It is by far the best leg and ab workout I've had in a long time.  AND it has helped my balance and posture tremendously.

Really it was three bands in one with various members performing in different groupings to open the show. I think at one point there were 11 people on stage--four guitars for sure, and everyone switched from horns, to drums to bass to vocals. Really thick, dreamy music you must hear AND see if  urlLink they're coming to a venue near you .

      Word to yo motha.  I trust that all the ladies had a lovely weekend...I was in Kansas City with the fam.  Mary is SO TALL!  She comes up to my chest and she is only 7.  It's off the hizzle fo shizzle.    Tonight is a big one, what with pottery class and all.  Who's to say what will go down after class.   I started "researching" grad schools yesterday (aka surfing the net and ending up frustrated b/c I can't seem to find the info I need).  Shan how is school going now?  Still feeling like it may not be your thing???  Give it time...  I'm off to the mall with Gracie to get her some educational toys.  Yesterday we went to this Gymboree class where I swear the teacher was on uppers or something.  She was hopping around the room like a damn kangaroo (but looked more like a woodpecker); she had way more energy than any of the kids.  Then we sang such classics as "Where is Gymbo?" and "Bubbles in the Air."  I tell you, I challenge myself and learn something new every day with this job.

"Good morning Ali-Cat,  Things were hectic on Friday, so you didnt get a joke, sorry.  However, I found something you would like even more while out on a ride saturday...    I was on my way home when I approached a white blob on the side of the trail.  I couldnt tell what it was but it was moving.  I  thought it was a small dog at first, but then I realized it was a fat, white/tan cat grooming itself.  You should have seen it.

      So, here's the latest... On Thursday I went to the Green Mill, a Chicago favorite, with some classmates from the English program. It is an old jazz/swing club, which reportedly was owned by Al Capone back in the day. It is great on Thursday nights, because they have a 15 piece swing orchestra. Now, as many of you know, Shan does not dance. What, you may ask, does she find enjoyable at this place, then? Well, I enjoy the decor, which has not changed since its opening back in the 30's, love the music, and like watching good swing dancers. This is I think the third time the new English people have gotten together for fun and drinks, and I have to say, it's still a little awkward. Some of these people are a little kooky and goofy, as English majors can be. But, not me! Oh yes, get a new beers in me and I am by usual obnoxious self. I think I seriously kept the conversation going at some points by just being an idiot. But, you can't talk about Chaucer and Milton all the time. Come on, people! Some of them would, I think... So anyway, the night hit a high point when a nattily dressed dancer spilled his drink down the back of my pants (not while he was dancing, though). How, you may ask, did this incident occur? Well, friends, all of you are familiar with the trouser styles of today, which sit pretty low on the rear. Mind you, I'm no Britney Spears, but I do sport the pants, now!! So, as I was sitting in said pants, having a nice chat with my fellow students, dancer guy accidentally pours almost a whole drink down my pants. I was wearing khakis, but all was well, as he was drinking something clear. Matt was none too amused with these shenanigans, but I let it go.   Also on Thursday, I checked out the new H & M store that opened on Michigan Avenue. Have to say, I was a little scared. Not only were there about 300 people in the place, but the 80's wear was abundant!! We're talking oversized, off the shoulder sweatshirts. I am not ready for that, and I hope most other people aren't either. A lot of their clothes did look cute -- and reasonably priced-- but I could not handle the madness. Teens everywhere, grabbing tapered jeans and  other bad items had me running for cover. The lines to the dressing rooms snaked all the way through the stores, also making me not want to try anything on. I will be back, though, hopefully when the 80's have left... With much relief I headed next door to Filene's Basement (aka TJ Maxx) and felt safe and comfortable shopping there amid the J. Lo sweats and FuBu Ladies gear.   Ok, that's all I can blog for now. I went to the Lincoln Park Zoo today and hopefully here is a picture of my favorite animal, whose stuffed friend was left at La Quinta on SB '98!

      Hey ladies... So the delinquent blogger is finally getting on the ball.  Or I was going to until I realized I have to pick Mary up at the bus stop...hold on.  Such is living on the edge as a nanny.    And I'm back.  I apologize for taking forever to get on this blogger thang (by the way, a couple days ago Jon and I were getting some household items-goodtimes, I know-and out of nowhere I said, "What if Linens 'n Things changed their name to Linens 'n Thangs to appeal to a thuggish ruggish clientele?  And maybe got Fubu and P Diddy of Sean John to design some stuff for them?").  So I guess I have some catching up to do, and here I go!  I am working as a nanny for 4 kids.  3 are in school all day so I spend my days with a 2 year old...for a good mental image of this kid, picture Cindy Loo Hoo from Dr. Seuss.  That's Gracie; she's a great kid to take care of...very easygoing and fun.  It has taken some adjustment, but I'm starting to really like it.  I am still applying for grad school for next fall; being a nanny doesn't exactly have career path written all over it.    I'm living in Newton, which is about 15 minutes outside of Boston.  It's a sweet area (what I've seen of it, anyway) and I LOVE my apt.  Although I felt like such a mom having to buy floor guards for every piece of furniture so nothing scratches up the wood floors, which are new.  And gorgeous.  Also I'm sleeping in my very own big-girl bed (aka, a queen size) for pretty much the first time, and I love that too.    Hmm now on to extracurricular activities.  *wink wink* (Right, I wish my life was that exciting.)  I am taking a beginning wheel-throwing class on Tuesdays and had my first class last week.  The class is cool so far and has a good teacher.  There are two gals around our age so I'm HOPING to make some friends.  Gee I hope they like me. ;) And Alison, you'd love this...Jon and I go to a trivia night at this bar called innerlimits every Thursday with some of his friends.  The questions are mostly geared towards the older folks, so we haven't exactly cleaned up, but we have racked up $25 in gift certificates.  And hey, more than the prizes, it gives me a good kick in the head to think, maybe I'm not as smart as I once thought.  I have had a couple moments of glory, however.  I haven't let CHS down; I got the kalamata olive question AND a Don Quixote question fast as lightnin', I say.    This weekend, I jet off to Kansas City for my great aunt's memorial service.  I get to see my siblings, which will be great, but I would like to stay around here and kick it.  Plenty of time for that soon enough, though...Oh, and I'm coming back to Indy Oct. 24; my friend Kristin (from DePauw) is getting married on the 25th.  So I hope to see some of the crew out and about that weekend!  Wicked.  How B-town am I.    Peace, love, and leather pants,  Jenny

Went to the medic on the lot here, and had my temperature taken.  96 degrees.  I'm hot and cold, and my left ear is killing me.  Pretty sure it's an ear infection.  Waaaa.  That may explain why I'm off balance and bumping into everything.  I'm headed to the real doctor this afternoon to hopefully get on some antibiotics.  See you tomorrow.

Or do you call it this weekend, or this last weekend? Eh, who cares.    "The Girl Turns Off the Picture"    After a long week of work, I crashed on the couch Friday night with some newly checked out DVD's from the On-Lot Library.  I popped in "The Kid Stays in the Picture", the documentary of producer Robert Evans, and lasted about twenty minutes with it.  It was all still shots of him from back in the day with his chatty, rambly voice over, and well, he just sounds a little too pompous for my liking.  Woo hoo, he married Ali MacGraw, woo hoo he has a thinner nose than The King of Pop... *CLICK* and off he went.  The roomie, Rayna, was cleaning out the bunny cage while it was on (more on the bunny in a minute), and she's like, "who's that?"  Funny thing is, Ray was at the "Intolerable Cruelty" wrap party where Mr. Evans was, and still doesn't know who he is.  Silly girl.  She moves out to L.A., and admits to knowing very little about those in this city.  No matter though, she's learning a ton at her veterinary job, which leads me to my next topic...    My Apartment is Turning into the L.A. Zoo    What started out with a few Betta fish, turned into one big pet purchasing habit for the roomie.  She now owns multiple fish, frogs, bumblebee frogs, chameleons, mice, crickets, lizards, toads, and she has rescued a bunny named Faith, who resides in a big cage in our living room.  The most recent acquisition is a baby squirrel, and Ray's having to stay up at all hours to nurse the little Stuart with a syringe and formula.  He was near death when the vet office first got him, and now he's eating on his own, opening his eyes, and probably able to be set free soon.  She's a pet miracle worker, I swear!  Stuart's nearing departure makes Ray sad, which in turn makes me sad for her.  Remember, I'm NOT a pet person, and I'm allergic to dogs and cats for the most part, so it figures that my roommate chooses to get every other pet imaginable in our close living quarters.  They make her happy, and I'm not there often, so it works out fine.  I usually sing George Michael's "Faith" to Faith the bunny in the morning before I zoom off to work.  Little by little, these critters are growing on me.  :)  More on my cracked out weekend later.  Happy Hump Day!

Well, I saw him the other day coming out of Bear's....

There were hairy shirtless guys and random dogs as far as the eye could see.

After a long day of script revisions, interoffice web porn fiascos, and a so so preview screening of one of our new episodes, the day is STILL not over!  I'm currently clawing my face off waiting for Boss #1 to finish his A story and make a B line to the door for the night.  Until then, I will attempt to BLOG something worth reading.  Or not.    Recap on some of K's weekend :    "Lost in Translation"   Caught "Lost in Translation" at the  urlLink ArcLight Hollywood   Not only were Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannsens' performances superb, but I had completely forgotten how wonderful the ArcLight Theater itself is.  No, I haven't gotten over the fact that a ticket costs $14, but being able to purchase the tickets in advance and have reserved seating so you can waltz in a minute before the previews start is definitely worth it.  If the movie is in the  urlLink Cineramadome  this cooky usher stands up and introduces the movie, who's in it, who directed it, and any other little useless tidbits one might want to know about the movie they're so anxiously awaiting to see.  *Remember to consider being that lame usher when unemployed* Other great things about the movie also worth noting; cinematography and Giovanni Ribisi nailing the hell out of the Spike Jonze-ish character.  I just helped Boss #1 spell Damocles.  *Wondering just HOW that fits into our little show here*   "Guess" What I Did?   No haircut was had.  I didn't get up as early on Saturday as I would've liked, and had to rush to the eye doctor appointment (gotta take advantage of this great insurance while I have it) for the yearly eye exam.  I had mentioned to the eye doc that I wanted to be able to wear my glasses to work more, and she recommended transition lenses!  Um, NO THANKS.  Yes, I want to be comfortable, but aint' no way in hell I'm gonna start looking like a skeezy dude who drives a conversion van with that wood paneling stripe on the side.    Also, how is one supposed to properly pick out a new pair of glasses when they don't have their glasses on to see correctly?  I asked the sweet eye technician, Coyo, to help me narrow down the two pairs of glasses I had, "Better 1? Better 2?"  We deduced that plastic glasses slide off of this big shnozz of mine, so we went with the metal framed Guess glasses.  I just might start tight rolling the jeans again and carrying an Esprit tote again.    It was interesting too, the optical emporium had a fine line of glasses from Lauren Hutton and Catherine Deneuve's respective collections.  I guess I didn't realize that over the hill actresses could make a killing in eyeglasses.  Who knew!  Okay, I think I'm going to go upstairs and make some EasyMac.  Nearing hour twelve... *sigh*

      Tuesday's a Good Day for Irony...  Just finished working this morning as a "career counselor" for immigrants in Uptown. I am just sitting here thinking about the fact that my job is to help people find jobs and get their lives together, I am currently having a professional crisis. I do not, right now, find grad studies in English to be my life calling. At this point, if I was really serious about the whole thing, I would not procrastinate on doing my homework and dread going to class. Right? Or would I still procrastinate because that's what we all do? I guess no job or school is what it's cracked up to be- oh well.   I too have been sniffling into a hanky about the fate of Ben and Jen. Maybe I just have a cold from all the yucky kids I've been around lately... Must go to Einstein's Bagels and also get ice cream. Without a doubt, it will be snacktacular!  &emailalert=no&email=adgrant@indiana.edu&url=http://closeproximity.blogspot.com&name=Proximity&bgcolor=003399&fcolor=FFFFFF&link=FFFFCC&words=comments&title=Comments &width=350&height=350">

      Shan, a.k.a. Chicago, has finally arrived to rock the boat!    Actually, the weather has been sucking so much here lately that I think quite a few boats were rocking over yonder in the harbors. Since the theme seems to be "what I'm up to," I have to say that you all sound like your weekends are tons better than mine! Not that reading, reading, reading, and staring at rain clouds doesn't hold a certain amount of charm, you know. Let's see... I joined some new fellow grad-mates on Friday night for a rousing evening of chat, noodles  urlLink (Noodles and Co.)  , and beer (at  urlLink Prairie Moon -- a good locale for beers other than Bud Light)  in Evanston. Just so all noodle-eaters have a clear understanding: Noodles and Co. serves Asian, Italian, and other "American" (?) dishes. There is a virtual smorgasbord of options! Laughed until I practically peed my pants at Robin Williams in an HBO special (I am a little upset by the fact that he is vulgar-- Mrs. Doubtfire never really got that point across)! I also viewed Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers... I wish the books could hold my attention, but I hate to say that I like these movies better than the 'ol written word.   I did manage to venture out of my apartment today for some tasty brunch at  urlLink Benedict's  on Lincoln (in Lincoln Square) and then for some jigging at the  urlLink Chicago Celtic Festival  downtown at Grant Park. While rain clouds loomed overhead, I enjoyed a harpist, some cute Irish dancer children with scary wigs, and crafty artwork.   I can't wait for all of our respective cities to be up and running! &emailalert=no&email=adgrant@indiana.edu&url=http://closeproximity.blogspot.com&name=Proximity&bgcolor=003399&fcolor=FFFFFF&link=FFFFCC&words=comments&title=Comments &width=350&height=350">

Here's a picture of Nick checking out the fly steering wheels at Pep Boys:    After that, the night got better when we went to the IU Fine Arts building to see  urlLink A Mighty Wind  and then to Yogi's for some black and tans.   Today we headed into Hoosier National Forest and up the firetower for some beautiful panoramic views of the wilderness.

      Greetings from sunny So-Cal.  I'm jealous of those on the East coast, whose weekends have begun, as I'm dying to get out of here.  On tap for the weekend:  A bunch of us movie nerds are headed to see Sofia Coppola's latest film,  urlLink "Lost in Translation ", which opens tonight in select theaters.  Bill Murray with Tokyo as his backdrop, unable to speak the language is sure to be some visually and comically arresting stuff.    I'm getting the hair cut tomorrow at  urlLink The Standard Hotel on Sunset .  There's a hip salon there that's dirt cheap called Rudy's Barbershop, and they have free valet with validation!  The coolest thing is that you can't book appointments in advance there.  So you just go in, put your name on the list, and then go wait in one of the hotel lounge or pool areas where some eurotrash dj is spinning some tunes.  It's a great place to spy on celebs and beautiful people while sitting in a big furry white chair, sipping on a $12 martini.  It's almost worth the price of a plane ticket to take part in this fun little afternoon.   Last time I was there, John, Leah, and I spotted Jessica Simpson (of recent  urlLink MTV "Newlyweds " fame) and two of her pals laying out by the pool that overlooks the city.  They were drinking Amstel Lights and getting even orangy-browner by the L.A. minute.  Leah also commented when J.S. was getting up to put her clothes on, that she hadn't ever seen a skirt that short.  Oh, and those boobs have to be fake.  If you haven't caught any of her MTV reality show, you must, as it's horrrrible.  She asks her 98degree husband, Nick Lachey, if Chicken of the Sea is tuna or chicken.  This goes on for five + minutes.  It's so bad it's good!    Have a great weekend everyone.  Happy blogging!

Little did I know that she is actually a stress factor in my life. A recent  urlLink study  determined that people who closely watch her show have 20% higher stress level than those who don't. Personally, the only thing that stresses me about Oprah is her hair. The helmet 'do has really worn itself out. Time to move on! (And, by the way, I'm not a devoted fan, just a by chance viewer. Since it's on more than 2 times a day here, though, it's not hard to catch the show).

"He's dancing with the angels," said his daughter, Marsha Nasser.  A retired businessman, Nasser danced almost nightly at Terre Haute's nightclubs and discos for years after his retirement.  And at age 62, he caught the stripping bug when he got to fill in for an injured  urlLink  Chippendales  exotic dancer at a Terre Haute nightclub. He soon began stripping at private birthday and bachelorette parties.  The senior stripper caught they attention of the nationally syndicated "Bob and Tom" radio show, on which he was interviewed and later featured in the show's advertisments.  Nasser also strutted his stuff on the  urlLink "Maury Povich Show,"  appearing in a segment titled, "We're Totally Opposite, but We're Madly in Love."  Nasser's son, Marlon, said his father just liked to make people laugh."   urlLink The Full Story .  Ok, first off, Terre Haute has  multiple nightclubs? And women from this fair city want a 70-year-old man stripping for them? And on national TV?  All I know is that when I imagine this man performing as a Chippendale dancer, it brings to mind the Saturday Night Live sketch where Patrick Swayze and Chris Farley  urlLink dance  and try out for position on the...um, squad. Let's just hope old Disco Ernie had heart.   R.I.P., Ernie

As a kid, I remember watching a cartoon version of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" and thinking that was just the coolest thing ever. (It's also a really good  urlLink read ). One of all time my favorite crazy and spooky stories is  urlLink The Fall of the House of Usher  by  urlLink Edgar Allen Poe . It is a very gloomy day here, perfect for Halloween. Have a fun night everyone, and I still don't know what my costume is going to be! I'm going to an 80's cover band concert / costume party. Last minute ideas? Oh, and on a side note,  Insane Clown Posse was here last night, playing across the street from my work. Yesterday morning, it totally freaked me out to see hundreds of fans with their faces painted up at 8:30 in the morning. Maybe I should go with that for a costume...

I talked to him today about his new night gig, and I couldn't be more thrilled for him.  He loves being Miss Jaclyn Payne, a dancing, singing, strutting her stuff kinda diva who performs and competes in Northern Indiana.  Not sure if there's much of a crowd up that way, but if you can reach just one person, then it's worth it, right?

Hey anything's better than being Kid Rock's lady...ugh.   Here's some of Pam's wit and wisdom from a  urlLink Telegraph article :  "My breasts, they're so 1999, you know," she says wistfully.   The writer also shares words of advice in her monthly Jane column [not Marie Claire, as the Telegraph says]: "Q: 'If a guy really wants to impress you, Pamela, what should he do?'   A: 'Besides penetration? It's the little things.'"   I also love the discussion of implants: in there or gone?  "I'd been told beforehand that she'd had her implants removed, and was therefore greatly taken aback by the sheer amplitude before me. If this is her without implants, what on earth was she like before?   But later on, Hedda, Pamela's 'business partner', puts me right on the whole implant question. 'They were in, then they were out, and now they're back in again.'"   It makes me wonder if she uses a new set of implants or if she keeps the old ones in a box under her bed or something and pulls them out and dusts them off when the mood strikes.

         yesterday i went to walgreens for some juice and while in line to check out, i noticed the selection of snacks that bombards you at most store registers.  what was profound about this display was the signage that said "need a snack?" and was right below a box of super glue.  so apparently, at walgreens, they are encouraging the practice many people attempt to leave in kindergarten, eating paste.  along with snickers, twizzlers, and reese's, one can also snack on glue.....yummy!

Here's an example of the latter.    Read the memo of the poor New York paralegal who was either so used to cranking out the memos (much like an English grad student deconstructs that text, Shan!) that when she was given this assignment, she attacked it with the excitement of any other case, or maybe she was just so fed up with her menial tasks, that she created the sarcastic  urlLink Sushi Memo  to shut her boss up for a bit.   *is it too early for sake?*

It was only 10k so should have known that was a little small for three video tracks, and one sound track.  So, here is the commercial on my website:  www.leahdieterich.com/nokia.avi  It is 11MB so it will take a while to download.  Enjoy!

      ...     whilst driving to work today, i was flipping through morning radio and came across a familiar song "now taaaake these broken wings and learn to fly again, learn to live so freeeee!".  now this song always has made me laugh, along with some other choice songs.  but this time i was listening, really listening and i found some of the lyrics disturbing "you are half of the flesh and blood that makes me whoooole".  then it made me remember the time that faye took me to her christian bible study/convert jennie before she goes to hell!  and how her friend jackie was telling me i will go to hell unless i allow the Lord into my life the way she wants me to, all along referencing particular passages (the good old "i am the vine, you are the branches" and " you are the clay, i am the potter").  she even used the word "saved", not in refernce to me, mind you!   so i think mr. mister is trying to start a cult.....and i used to sing along.  the evidence is all right here:  Baby, I don't understand, why we can't just hold on to each others' hands This time might be the last, I fear, unless I make it all too clear I need you so, ohh  Chorus: Take these broken wings, and learn to fly again, learn to live so free And when we hear the voices sing, the book of love will open up and let us in  Take these broken wings  Baby, I think tonight, we can take what was wrong and make it right, mmm Baby, it's all I know, that you're half of the flesh And blood that makes me whole, I need you so, so  (chorus)  Take these broken wings, you've got to learn to fly Learn to live life so free And when we hear the voices sing, the book of love will open up and let us in Yeah yeah, let us in, let us in  (Solo)  Baby, it's all I know, that you're half of the flesh And blood that makes me whole, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, so  (chorus)  Take these broken wings, you've got to learn to fly Learn to live your life so free And when we hear the voices sing The book of love will open up for us and let us in, yeah yeah Yeah yeah, oooh  so i am sticking with shaking my tail feather....

Since this post is clearly not anonymous, it won't be the worst thing I suppose... Just last week, I sort of backed into a car parked behind me. There wasn't any damage, but I didn't leave a note or anything. Ok, that was kind of lame, but (especially for you Shan, living in Chicago and all, where hitting a parked car is about as bad as not using your turn signal) it's the most recent thing I could think of and I DID really feel sort of bad about it. I'll update when I think of something really devilish. Feel free to comment anonymously, all you troublemakers.

So, my fellow TA scott and i have to work on the project too and so i did a little mock up commerical of one of our ideas for the spot.  I am posting it here.  Its a quicktime movie and only 10K so it should download fairly quick.

Has anyone else seen it or have any opinions? Although Gwyn is not one of my faves, I think she would be perfect in this role. I was so intrigued by her marriage to Ted Huges after reading  Letters Home , a collection of Sylvia's letters compiled and edited by her mother. They begin with her early college days and end right before her death. I have a really old copy of the book so I have no idea if it is still in print, but I'm sure there will be an onslaught of new stuff now that the movie is out. I also saw a super weird movie of her life about a year ago, which was filmed in the 70's and was just eerie.   Any other good movies out now? I am interested in  Pieces of April  too, but I'm not sure I want to go anywhere near the cast of Dawson's Creek anytime soon.

      due to my lack of work at the restaurant this week, i am finding myself with more evenings to plop on the couch and entertain myself with random shows.....my favorite being "the 80's strikes back" on vh1.  on most all topics, there is an interview with hal sparks (alison's previous loverboy!) and that guy from ed, who really is funny, but where did he come from?  juliette lewis also pipes in a bit, but what i really love is being reminded of the time when trapper keepers were HOT and ocean pacific rivaled dolce and gabbana for cool points.  of course, the biggies stick out: mr. t, who shot jr, culture club.....but where would i be now without scratch and sniff stickers?  no matter that you knew it would stink, you still scrated and sniffed the skunk with as much enthusiasm as the root beer mug.  damn, i think i can credit my good grades to scratch and sniff since without that check plus, there was no sticker.  and then trapper keepers were banned, yes banned, in fourth grade at christ the king grade school....but being the rebel that i am, i stuck with it and carried a polar bear trapper, risking detention and sentencing to hell.  if only that was still the case, trapper keepers being contraband instead of guns......tear, tear.  try this wee match up game at  urlLink 80s Strikes Back . who knew ronald was a jelly belly fan?

First Elliott Smith, now  urlLink Fred Berry  has passed away this week.  They say it happens in threes, so I'm scared to see who's next.  Fred passed away in his L.A. home from natural causes at the young age of 52.  He was famous for playing red beret wearing Rerun on the late 70's hit "What's Happening?".  It pretty much went downhill for him from there.   Six Degrees of Rerun   My Uncle's good friend was roommates with him in the late 80's in NYC after one of Reruns many divorces.  He's one of the few who had a Rerun Fan Club T-shirt.  Probably quite the collectors item now. Kinda weird that Rerun had fan club t-shirts on hand at his apartment.  Doesn't a fan of his make the t-shirts and distribute them?  I wouldn't know, as I wasn't the sizable star that Fred was.   A writer for the show I'm working on received a birthday wake-up from Fred himself a couple months back.  He said it was the most bizarre way to wake up ever.  They had a nice little chat.  Longer than the 30 seconds they're alotted I'd venture to guess.   Celebrity Deaths   Since we're on the topic, I thought I'd mention a much talked about website on celebrity deaths which was started and is still maintained by a family friend of mine, Scott Michaels.   Scott also used to run the Graveline Tours out here in L.A., but moved to London to be with his partner who is a big BBC star just now breaking out in the U.S.  Well, Scott's back in L.A., and has lots of death to talk about on his site.  Check out  urlLink FindADeath.Com  to find out your favorite celebrity deaths.  A bit morbid I know, but it's really neat to see how passionate Scott is about giving detailed accounts full of stories, photos, and public records.  The site itself is a bit clunky, but the content is worth a second look.  It's great when you've got a couple spare hours in the office, and you find yourself wondering, "just what exactly DID happen to Heather O'Rourke, the Poltergeist girl?"

      ...it's snowing in Boston.  The leaves haven't even fallen off of the trees-and some of them are still green!-but sure enough, it's snowing big fat fluffy flakes, and over an inch has accumulated already.  The first snow always gives me a nice warm fuzzy feeling and for a second or two, I think that I actually like the winter...until the first time I soak my shoes and the bottom half of my jeans walking to the car and then numb up my hands scraping the ice off of the windshield.  Then I wise up and spend the drive to work with one hand on the steering wheel (or in my pocket) and the other raised high in the air, flipping old man weather the bird (or playing the piano).

The cause of death is undetermined.  I saw Smith this summer, and while I'm really glad I did when I got the chance, I remember both Mike and I commenting that he really looked  not well . At the time, we thought he was very drunk, but who knows.  Smith is best known for his 1997 Academy Award nomination for the song 'Miss Misery,' which was featured on the Good Will Hunting Soundtrack. He also contributed music to the wonderful film the Royal Tenenbaums, and I think his music fits in perfectly with Wes Anderson's brother Eric's whimsical  urlLink drawings .  My favorite Elliott Smith song is probably 'In the Lost and Found.' It's melancholy and full of longing and just very beautiful. Here's a  urlLink review  of Figure 8, the album that song is on.  UPDATE: I hate to link to MTV, but they seem to have the most current information. It looks like his death is an  urlLink apparent suicide .

      so yes it is monday in case you haven;t noticed and i decided to start my week off right.  at the center this morn, as i am zipping up my pants (after taking a wiz, not rolling in the hay), i zip my scarf into my zipper.  not so bad if i can get the damn thing out, but no, the world doesn;t work that way, as i have learned from the cubs and sox.  so i am destined to spend the rest of the day at half mast, scarf entwined with zipper, and tug at my sweater to hide said atrocity.  but at least when i stand next to attractive fellows in a barski, i avoid camel toe.  (hee hee, shall i sent that bit to jean?....you KNOW it had to be said!)  anyhoot, in response to such lovely blogs, what's not to like?....literary club: GOOD!, watching jessica simpson go camping with louis vuitton bag and bear bin: GOOD!, dogs lead a cheer: GOOD!  and, jenny, may i suggest kevin bacon and lady in red boots from footloose, or if going for the man on man theme, kevin and jack his stalker from will and grace.  OR jessica and nick ;)  but why be constricted with people, think washer and dryer, ketchup and mustard, pot and kettle?  seriously, why not jesse and chester from "dude where's my car" complete with track suits and "dude" and "sweet" tats?  and i'm spent......

      I'm devastated to say that I think New England has better foliage than Indiana, even than Brown County.

I was in New Hampshire over the weekend, and they just have some great leaves.  Mountains too.  Exciting stuff...  I am looking for couples' costumes suggestions if you bloggers out there happen to have any.  Jon came up with a gem of an idea...being Harry and Lloyd from Dumb and Dumber when they're wearing the orange and white suits...but I'm a little concerned about how we're going to acquire the necessary props to really pull it off.

Obviously, this one is up there for me (see picture above):   PampTOEna Toe Toe Factor: ocho  Here we see another American Tourist who has decided to assume a rugged, "adventuresome" persona in order to procure beaver in a foreign land. For years, this line of flirting has been known as "The Running of the Bullshit", because the male (sometimes referred to as "the matadork") will do everything he can to obscure the fact that his primary form of exercise is usually just a few minutes on a body-by-jake ab and butt toner and that his typical adventure consists of using the H.O.V. with less than three people in his car. Of course, from her perspective, this young senorita doesn't need to know that her brave conquering American hero works in customer support for Gateway and toils in a windowless call center in Sioux Falls for 40 hrs/week, after which he drives home in his yellow Nissan X-terrra in time to watch "Are you hot?". Of course, she could be bullshitting him as well... her outfit looks a little like the color guard outfit that the Indiana University marching band uses. Perhaps this kind of role-playing is really what we want when we travel; except there's nothing too exotic or exciting about a part-time worker at the Barnes and Noble in Bloomington hooking up with Randy from Gateway.          This guy is not kidding around, buster. CNN.com has a story about  urlLink Bloomington liquor stores getting scanners  to combat students' fake ids.  Before, the fine folks at Big Red Liquors had to resort to asking you stupid questions as evidenced in the article: "I'll ask them what their astrological sign is, just to see how they react," Ludy says. My personal favorite, however, is "What's your high school mascot?" Who has the time to go around memorizing all that crap?

Last night I caught one of the entertainment shows, and they were basically profiling the latest idiotic comments made by the lovely lady. Two great features: She asks Nick: "Do I smell inscent?" He replies, "Don't you mean incense?" She counters" "What's that?" The clip also leads to the revelation that Jess is unfamiliar with the term "razzing," and Nick explains the meaning to her once again. The segment concludes with her saying something like, "I'm not stupid. I'm funny! I laugh at myself all the time!" So are we.   While online today, I came across the interesting artilce:   urlLink Raised By A Pack of French Poodles: Jessica Simpson's Mesmerising Brand of Dumb  , which details why we superior beings all find her so fascinating. I know I'm generalizing here, but most people do find her pretty damn stupid. I love the title's insinuation: not raised by wolves, in a barn, what have you, but by a pack of French poodles, who have inspired Jessica's best coping tactic: whining, then begging Nick to let her hire someone to make it all go away.

Who's up for a game of  urlLink Ghettopoly  (soon to be followed by Thugopoly, HipHopopoly, Hoodopoly, and RedNeckopoly)?    Playas use counterfeit money to buy drugs, guns, crack houses, gamble, and even achieve pimp status. The game pieces are also not your typical iron and race car...hours of fun!

My Top 5 Past Halloween Costumes    5.    Hula Girl  complete with grass skirt, scary Cher wig, and Flower Petals affixed to the boobs (thanks pasties, rubber cement, and Leah!)   4.  Bridget's  Gypsy  costume with the glittery gold see through pants.  I was decked out in this outfit one Bloomington evening at the Bluebird where a pretty well known IU basketball player said one and a half months post 9-11, "Hey, heard of anymore terrorist attacks lately?"  My gypsy ass almost kneed him in the jewels for what was quite possibly the saddest and weirdest pickup line I've EVER heard.   3.  My mom went crazy with the fake blood and gauze, and I guess I was a cross between a  zombie  and a really ugly made-up fourth grader.  This costume/Halloween happened to coincide with the recent San Francisco earthquake, so I was staggering around with an Oakland A's baseball card wrapped in the gauze and I was saying I was a SF earthquake victim.  I'm surely going to Hell for that one.   2.  When I was seven or so, Mom sewed together the coolest  Minnie Mouse  costume, or was it Mickey?  Okay, so I looked part mouse, part mime, but I had so much fun doing my Mickey impersonation at every doorstep.   1.   Groucho Marx .  I cannot tell you how many strange looks and teases I got in fifth grade for this one.  Leave it to me to wait until the last minute to put together a costume, not to mention listening to my Dad's suggestion as he's a huuuuge Groucho fan.  At the beginning of the night, I was so embarrassed, that when asked who I was, I just kinda shrugged and scampered away.  Towards the end of the night, I didn't care, and I was working that cigar and proud to wear a safari hat, mustache, and glasses!

Its from 1979 after another great Cubs loss to the Phillies with Mike Royko.   1979 Mike Royko  22:23 Phillies   Interviewer:  But they tied it up.  MR:  When they tied it up I was sure they were going to lose.  Interviewer:  The 9th inning 22-22.    MR:  Yeah.  Interviewer:  They go into the 10th inning.  Why were you sure they were                            going to lose?     MR:  Cuz they're the cubs.  They lose games like that.  They do               something heroic.  Come right to the end, and then right at the last          second they fail.  And that's what makes it so wonderful.  Because          that's bascially the story of all of us. I mean the Yankees aren't          real.  Nobody goes around winning and triumphing over everything.  99%          of most people don't triumph over anything.  You know, they just get by.    Interviewer:  Is chicago a good baseball town?  MR:  Oh, it's a marvelous baseball town.Fans are tolerant.  They get         mad,  but they're basically philosophical and tolerant.  I think         Chicagoans generally are more sensible or levelheaded than people in         many other parts of the country.  ARe that we've learned through         experiences such as the Cubs not to expect the most.  And to be happy         with smaller gifts.  That's why we can survive great blizzards, we've         survived political corruption, uh we survive gangsters...all the things         we're known for.  We survive all that.  We go on and we live and              were happy.  And the Cubs help teach us that life is rough.

Some argue this is a good thing because people will immerse themselves in what they want to read/listen to/watch without worrying about the cultural implications, but others say the phenomenon hurts culture at large because middlebrow consumers are not exposed to, and therefore interested in, elements of highbrow media and entertainment.   Either way, the author discusses the  Guardian's  list of  urlLink The 100 Greatest Novels of all Time , noting that, while it's a mixed bag of cultural classics and middlebrow favorites, they all are timeless because they ARE entertaining and just good stories.   I don't know if any of you would be interested or even have the time (Jenny, I'm looking at you), but I think it would be kind of fun to read some books at the same time and revive literary club. Maybe this list could be a jumping off point.

In an effort to encourage us to explore the web, one of my profs suggested googling weird phrases, such as: "old people who smell funny."  Being the good student, I find Smoo.org, a blog by a guy calling himself "Glendonious," who has a preoccupation with soft core porn (ie g-string clad female friends wrestling in kiddie pools of jello, long discussions about his desire to make it with Paris Hilton) and gross  stories, which always include something about bodily fluids. This excerpt is from his friend's email, and whether or not it's true, it's hilarious (and gross).    An e-mail from my friend Abby:  an emeriti professor decided to teach this term. he is old. and i mean OLD! he can barely move from a to b. He has aging spots all over his red and purple, crackly, flaking skin. He smells like old man body odor. his only utterances consist of strange and disgusting noises that precede south park-esq 'mmm kays'(unintentionally, of course), which leave bystanders thoroughly confused. He alternates between his 'mmm kays' with the word 'certainly,' sometimes interjecting this favorite word into complete silences.   What happened this afternoon, however, borders on the unimaginable..  enjoy....  This old dude comes in. smelling BAD. like BO. Then another smell wafts over to me. My first thought was, "abby, did you fart and not even know it?" But upon further reflection I came to the conclusion that this was the smell of shit. not a fart, belch, bad breath, or what have you.. but good, old-fashioned, shit-in-the-toilet- shit.  I look over and try to see if the professor had a soil mark on the back of his bright green shorts.. nothing...  i keep him in my sights, trying to figure out what the hell is going on.. then i notice it as he turns around. a big wet spot running down his front side - he asks me to send a fax.. Apparently not knowing he has pissed himself. I try not to break the horizon as i receive the would-be fax. I have no clue what to do. I opt to 'not notice.' Could this piss really be the cause of the shit smell??  Here's the kicker: As I'm sending the fax, professor x is bending down to pick something up. I wasn't wearing my contacts or glasses so I couldn't really make out what the object was. It was brown. I thought maybe it was his much-dropped cane. at this point prof x is REALLY struggling to pick this brown thing up, it was painful to watch. i decide that even old people who smell bad and piss themselves deserve some help. i take a step closer and open my mouth to say, "here, let me get that for you." but before i could offer, my eyes finally focus. they focus on a big, brown piece of fucking shit. a "oh hell no" -comes out instead. he appears not to hear me or notice that i see him picking up his feces with his bare hands. he walks into the copy room and throws it into the trash.  he is teaching this term  chew on that.   (warning: do not visit Smoo.org unless you WANT to look at the wrestling g-string chicks, because they're all over the place)

All I'll say is the Red Sox better win tonight, or I won't give the World Series a first glance.  Okay, so onto Halloween.  Not that I have solid plans for the spooooky holiday, but I would like to have a costume ready to go.  Any suggestions?  Alison, I know you'll probably bring up my old suggestions of being a 7-11 Big Gulp or that large shelving unit from our senior year plantation house/duplex like I always wanted you to be, but I need something better.  An inanimate object might not do the trick...hehe.  What are everyone else's Halloween costumes, ideas, and/or plans?

Tuesday night, Jeremy and I headed up to Indianapolis to see  urlLink Death Cab for Cutie  at the  urlLink The Patio . It was a good show, and they played a lot of stuff from their new album (which I love) and a lot of old stuff too. At times, however, I felt they were rushing through songs.  The best part was getting there early enough to see opening band and DCFC label mates  urlLink The Long Winters . I've have a few of their songs (lllegally downloaded...shh!), but seeing them live made a fan out of me. They had a lot of energy and a great chemistry with the crowd. They played a wonderful song called 'Cinnamon' that broke down in the middle with an homage to Neil Young's 'Cinnamon Girl.' AND they did a fantastic cover of Madonna's 'Don't Tell Me' from Music. They made a polished pop song sound so raw and passionate. Of course, though, I'm a sucker for covers. There's a great site,  urlLink The Covers Project , which comprehensively lists tons of bands and the artists who have covered your favorite songs. It's pretty amazing.   Ok, only two more tangents here: I got to see Byron at the show and found out he's started his own blog, (what cool person hasn't?)  urlLink So there I was, in the Congo... . Check it out; it's pretty byronious.   AND, being at the show with all the emo boys and girls made me think of one of my favorite Onion articles about  urlLink disaster at a Yo La Tengo show . Oh and there's a DCFC shout out at the end.

The movie got horrible reviews so he pulled it two weeks after its release some 20 odd years ago and has had it "in the basement" since then.  It was a musical done entirely on a set made in their studio to recreate las vegas....nonetheless the highlight of the night was when he was introduced by the artistic director of the denver film society (what a fucking joke) and FFC stepped out onto stage, right past the spotlight and took his well deserved bow in total darkness.  It was priceless.

Screw warm fuzzies, now I'm freaking out, wondering if the Cubs will squander their once 3-1 lead over the Marlins.  Ok so I'm not losing sleep over it, but I couldn't believe my eyes last night when that Cubs fan in the bleachers interfered with Moises Alou's attempt to catch the foul ball and get the second out.  Then those Cubbies unraveled like the insides of a baseball.  Wow.  The Marlins then scored 8 runs in the 8th inning.  A damn shame about those Red Sox too, Jenny.  Let's hope the two most cursed teams in baseball can pull it together and win, so they can meet up and have one big mess of a World Series.

      well, i too am going along with the national passtime that was never really personal or family favorite.....my grandpas both passed on prior to my birth so it was never an wgn for me; it was the 700 club and golf with grandma.  but alas, i have found a boyfriend, much like tbox, with a fondness for baseball that has delighted me the past couple weeks.  "hey jennie, instead of going to a movie or something, how about we watch the cubs at my house!"  WAHOO, sign me up!  unfortunately, i am not as devoted and have not really learned the players and their stats, but i did witness the famous sosa hit a homer about eight games ago :)  so sean has uncovered the inner baseball fanatic in me.....GO CUBS!  no subway rides or home games on the horizon, but you better believe my ass will be plopped on the couch tonight, beer in hand and chips ready to throw at the tv for bad calls....right after we attend a speaker for domestic violence that i am required to see.  so it's even steven.....but he still sang the beginning lyrics to elvis' song, suspicious minds, "i'm caught in a trap, and i can;t get out, because i love you too much baby" to make me laugh.    so here's hoping that the sox and cubbies pull on through tonight, for grandpa t, grandpa b, boo, seannessy, mariah, and all of us that love them :)

      Sad times for baseball last night...is there really a curse over the Cubs and the Red Sox?  I went to the Red Sox game and had a great time despite getting a little chilly.  I successfully took public transportation into Boston by myself for the first time, meeting interesting characters like a diehard Mariah Carey fan wearing a Rainbow t-shirt who thought Glitter was the best thing to happen to the box office sinceTitanic.  And we all know how touching Titanic is.  I even got there early for batting practice (Jon got a ball from Andy Pettite, pitcher for the Yankees...I shouldn't say "got" so much as "got in a brawl over;" he had his hand on the ball and was pulled into right field of Fenway Park by this Yankees fan trying to steal it from him!)...we sat in the bleachers and I was fortunate enough to overhear some exchanges between Yankees and Red Sox fans; the basic gist of all those being, "You suck!!!" "Yankees suck!" and "Mr. October (Derek Jeter) sucks!"  It's a good time.  At any rate, despite all this excitement, the Red Sox were the ones that sucked it up and blew the game.  Clowns.  And then later on in the evening, the Cubs followed suite and blew a 4-0 lead to lose to the Marlins.  And Katie, I feel your Grandpa Bob's devotion to the Cubs.  My Grandpa Tarbox may just be the guy to rival his love for the Cubs.  He too is closing in on 80 but is still willing to cruise the streets of Chicago scalping tickets for another Cubs game.  It's amazing how they never give up on these teams, despite failures and disappointments galore (yes, Ali, as in the Cure).  I'm nervous to email him today as I think last night's game may just have broken my poor Grandpa's heart.  Get it together, Cubs!  Here's hoping tonight goes better for the Cubs and the Red Sox!  PS Nyebag: I mentioned to Brett this weekend how I occasionally enjoy throwing up the peace sign while driving, i.e. when letting someone in.  He claims that this is all he, too, uses for hand gestures.  Right.

There's one person who's witnessed the ups and mostly downs of the Cubs ballclub; that someone being my Grandpa Bob.  There isn't a more loyal and devoted fan to the Cubbies than my Grandpa, and I get a little choked up at the thought of him cozied up on his couch right now with a blanket, remote control in hand, sound up FULL blast on the television, and 80+ years worth of anticipation for the big game tonight.  I have fond memories as a little girl sitting in the upstairs den with Grandpa Bob after church on Sundays, watching the Cubs on WGN lose another one in Wrigley.  While Dad's side of the family routed for the White Sox, and Mom's side being die hard Cubs fans, I remained a Chicago centrist and routed for them both.  I think I just loved how passionate and loyal Grandpa was to his Cubbies.  I made sure I memorized the backs of my Cubs baseball cards before sitting with Grandpa, so I could impress the pants off him when I didn't have to be quiet for a second.  I'd sip Root Beer and eat Matt's Chocolate Chip cookies from Grandma's famous glass cookie jar, and sing with Harry Caray during the 7th inning stretch.  I'd giggle when Grandma would comment on how cute Mark Grace's blue eyes were, or how adorable Ryne Sandberg looked in his uniform.  While she was more into the aesthetics of the athletes, Grandma still knew her stuff.  She'd sit with Grandpa during the games, usually curled up with a good book, but still kept close tabs on the "boys" like any mother of six and grandmother of many could.  She hooted and hollered with Grandpa when the Cubs scored.  Grandma still sits next to Grandpa Bob for every game with a book in hand, and a bowl full of goodies for Grandpa.  As the years passed, I wasn't able to spend as many afternoons with Grandpa watching the Cubs.  From grade school to middle school, and high school to college, I still checked in with Grandpa on the status of his Cubbies, and more often than not he'd reply, "They need to get some wins, that's for sure."  Even though the Cubs were often at the bottom of the list in the league standings, his loyalty to them always remained.  While I saw his loyalty to a baseball team, I realized just how much that loyalty remained in other facets of his life, with his family and friends, and how he lived his life.  Tonight he sits with his wife of 55 years, after spending probably 24,000 hours either listening or watching the Cubs, in hopes of seeing his team do the unthinkable...WIN THE BIG GAME.  I hope tonight my Grandma witnesses the unthinkable, seeing my Grandpa cry tears of joy.  Go Cubs!

The Nation has a  urlLink  Top 10 list of Bush's Assaults on Women (you have to scroll down a bit to see it). All of the policies that made the list are asinine, but some of them are downright scary:  2. Bush nominated Dr. David Hager to chair the Food and Drug Administration's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee. (Hager has written about Christ's ability to heal women's illnesses and reportedly refused to prescribe contraceptives to unmarried women.) The good news? Hager did not become chair. The bad news? He became a member of the committee.

      so there are many a thang that i love about working at the julian center (fyi, this is my americorps site).....i can call my site a "center for kids who cannot read good" since i am the literacy coordinator, we watch the young and the restless during lunch (so shan, i feel the daytime bondage, uh, bonding), and snoop dogg is one of our custodians...seriously, we are talking contest winning impersonator, in like, 20 yrs and without braids.  i still haven't mustered enough courage to ask for an autograph, but i will.    and one more thing, i hate soaps.  i am not a big fan of reality series either since the main premise is to imitate real life, but hey, who really lives with 20 other women competing for one man, or on a deserted island eating bugs, or who marries their sister's third husband who has survived a killer bee attack AND given birth?  but here i am each day at lunch, seemingly enthralled in this show simply because everyone else is and who really wants to hear "your show is crap!" from the new girl?  it's like saying "yeah, i eat here all of the time, and i love the ribeye" when waiting tables at sullivan;s despite my being a vegetarian; no one wants to hear it!  so this is what confuses me: we are told to be individuals, but one still makes more friends with honey that vinegar......  at least snoop and i can still roll down the street, sippin' on gin and juice.

      Saddle up, partners...I'm going to the Red Sox game today!  One of their chants is "Cowboy Up," which I get a real kick out of.  Like all of sudden we're not in Boston, we're in the wild wild west.  Anyway...the game on Sunday was rained out and moved to today, so I get to leave work early to go.  Goodtimes.  For those of you who don't have a boyfriend who is obsessed with baseball and has passed the bug onto you, the Red Sox are playing the Yankees for the American League Division Championship, and they're tied 2-2.  Here is an idea of just how knowledgable I have become about baseball: Me, after the game was rained out: "So now Burkett's not pitching?  Nice!"  (this guy sucks) Jon: "No, Wakefield's pitching tonight (Monday) and then Lowe on Tuesday." Me: "Sweet...Lowe's MUCH better at home." and Jon gives me the old double-take, how did you know that look.  Welp, considering I have watched more baseball in the past few weeks than ever before in my life, these things aren't hard to pick up.    So go Red Sox.  Cowboy up!   urlLink    Nyebag, glad to see you're hopping on the bloggin' wagon.  Shan and Alison, thanks for your help in telling me how to post!

Jerry was great, but the chemistry the four actors had on the show was amazing. Visit this site for some  urlLink great quotes from the show . Here are my personal favorites from each cast member:   "Go fold your little balloon animals, Eric.  Eric... What kind  of name is that for a clown?" - George, in "The Fire"  "The library investigator's name is actually Bookman?"     "It's true." "That's amazing.  That's like an ice cream man named Cone."                    - Kramer and the Librarian,                      in "The Library"  "You don't know my name, do you?"     "Yes I do." "What is it?"     "It, uh, rhymes with a female body part." "What is it?"     "Mulva..."                    - Dolores and Jerry,                      in "The Junior Mints"  "I'm not a terrible person."     "Noooo...." "No, when I shoo squirrels away, I always say 'Get out of here."  I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like  other people."     "That's nice." "Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street, I never ever stare  at them, and yet I'm careful not to look away, see, because  I want to make the freaks feel comfortable."     "That's nice for the freaks." "Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I go to the movies so  people can see." - Elaine and Jerry, in "The Lip Reader"   Or if you feel like hatin' on Jerry, read about his  urlLink garage for his Porsches .

Needless to say, I've been cooped up on a movie sound stage with no windows for 15+ hours a day.  It seems like night all day, and I'm eating way too much food from the craft services tables.  During my time on set, Arnold has been elected Governor, and the Cubs have moved onto the NLCS Championship.  Our last day of shooting this episode is Monday, and after that, I'll be back to my BLOGGING old self.  Fred stories to follow.

I'm very happy to say that I've had time to catch up with all of my friends who populate daytime television. It's good to know that even though I have not seen Days of Our Lives in maybe four years, I can still figure out what's going on...like that Sami's a bitch! Anyway, my big beef is with the wonderful program called The View. I hate it so much that I am not linking it up because I do not want anyone, at any time, to ever visit their web site and become interested in watching their show. I happened to catch a rerun (I'm pretty sure) the other day when Michael Moore was a guest. I am a big fan of Mike, and these women absolutely made asses out of themselves in order to get him to admit that he staged footage in  Bowling for Columbine . Mind you, they had no proof that he actually staged anything, just the scary idea that it's really not possible to get a free gun when you open a checking account at some bank in midwest America. I have never tried to do this myself, but I feel pretty confident that of all the scenes he could have staged, that one would have been near impossible to stage, unless he built his own bank and hired actors. It also really bothers me that women, aged mid 20's on up, like this show and think these chicks are happenin' ladies that middle aged housewives should want to emulate. Barf!!   Returning to better things,  urlLink Michael Moore's web site  is cool, and is View-free. I really liked the  Columbine  DVD with all the additional materials and both the site and the DVD give more insight into him as a person and documentarian.

Imagine if that customer were famous?  urlLink Bitterwaitress  has hilarious stories about celebrities of all kinds being not tipping and behaving badly (though some are warm fuzzy ones).   One of my favorites was about Eddie Money, who obviously deserves something else besides two tickets to paradise:  "I used to have a really great (i.e. good $) waitressing job in LA...mostly soap stars and people who think they are SOMEBODY reading scripts at the table. He used to come in every Sunday for lobster brunch with his bimbo wife and 4 squealing kids and he NEVER left a tip. He still has an 80's rocker mullet and his wife is boobs on a stick. He's a has-been but I still expected him to give me something for a tip."

It is about a weirdo of a little boy that was coming to the education program at my work. His name, which could be the best part here, is Gockberk. He is from Turkey. And, mind you, he is not a cute Gockberk. The kid has a freakishly huge head and he NEVER stops crying. One day, I was roped into holding him after he had been crying for maybe 30 minutes. I noticed that the poor Gock was dressed in a onesie (the baby underwear that snaps down below), corduroy pants, a heavy dress shirt, and a woolen vest in an 85 degree room. He was all sweaty and uncomfortable looking, so I took off his vest. He stopped crying almost immediately. Just when I was beginning to have some fondness for his large Turkish cranium, his mom came in the room and basically bitched me out in Turkish for removing the precious vest. Well! Poor Gocky had to wear the thing for the rest of the day and pretty much cried for the remainder of the day. None of the kids like him because he never shuts up and he is the only Turkish one in the group. After that, he only came back once and I think his mom requested that I not be allowed to watch him. I just like his name.   Also, there is this crazy show on the WB called  urlLink The BeastMaster . Matt and I were watching it this weekend when there was nothing else on tv. It made us laugh but it was really some Tarzan-esque type of show. Check out the site-- this guy is a real hottie!

But the only i love more than Bill (Bob) Murray, is Bill (Bob) Murray singing.... and i thought the karaoke rendition of Roxy Music's "More than This" was so incredibly honest and funny and sad all at the same time.

The Cubs are contenders for the World Series, and tonight was the 4th game out of 5 to determine their advancement into the nationals. Matt, Amy, Rob (aka Feminitas) and I all watched the game at  urlLink Guthrie's Tavern  on Addison, about 2 blocks from Wrigley Field. It was a cool experience because longtime Chicagoans and crazy baseball fans were abundant at this nightspot. People were screaming at the top of their lungs, and despite all the cheering, poor Sammy Sosa just couldn't pull it off. He has been kind of sucking lately. So, the Cubs will play Atlanta again tomorrow night to decide their fate.   I don't really care that much about sports but I tend to get excited when everyone else is when it comes to games. Doesn't matter-- could be Scrabble, Hollywood Squares, kick the can, whatever.  Also, McEwan's IPA is really a good beer. I've been a longtime fan of McEwan's Scotch Ale, which is the best, but the IPA is not bad. I highly recommend trying it if you can track it down. My all time favorite bar, the Heorot in Muncie, IN, always kept me happy with a full refrigerator shelf of the stuff. Happy Weekend.

It might've been the Superbowl even, but on that cold winter evening in 1987, my heart was instantly warmed when I saw the series premiere of "The Wonder Years".  The moment I laid eyes on eleven year old Fred Savage, I experienced little girl lust for the first time.  He was just the right amount of cute, clumsy, and caring that kept me tuning in Tuesday nights for many years to come.  He was from Chicago, and I was only an hour away from there, and well, we had something in common dammit!  I loved him, I loved the show, and I loved the whole idea behind celebrity and the entertainment industry.    One lazy summer day, while perusing through the latest Bop or Teen Beat magazine, I came across Fred Savage's mailing address in the back of the publication.  Keep in mind this was before the Internet, so a plethora of information on your favorite star wasn't readily available.  I thought I had hit the jackpot!  Not knowing at the time that it was most likely his talent agency's address and not his very own personal address, I immediately began writing page upon page of why I loved Fred's SHOW so much.  Even at my young age, I knew I didn't want to sound desperate, so I would NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES tell Fred how much I wanted him to come over and trade baseball cards, how I wanted him to come Pogo Ballin' with me, or how I wanted him to be my first kiss.  It was so hard for my little girl pen to refrain from writing, "I love you so much," or "Can I come to Los Angeles and visit you?"    After a few drafts, and a proofread from my best friend Teresa, who also was a HUGE Fred fan, I obeyed the magazine's suggestions and included a self-addressed stamped envelope to the far away address in L.A.  I even put two stamps on the outer envelope just in case.  I made my Mom make a special trip to the post office that night, eventhough there wouldn't be another pickup until morning.  She took me anyway.    For the first few days, I was checking the mail daily.  After awhile, I just stopped looking.  How could Fred ignore my sweet attempt at wooing him over without being forward?  He's busy, not to mention I'm one of the thousands of girls from the Midwest sending him a letter. I didn't lose hope.  I "knew" him well enough, that he wouldn't let my letter go unnoticed.  Months had passed and I had forgotten about my letter, until one day when I was fetching the mail, I noticed an envelope with handwriting on the outside that looked a lot like mine.  Ohmigosh, Fred wrote me back!  I bolted into the house, and tore open the letter to find two glossy 4x6 postcards.  One was a photo with all of the cast members of The Wonder Years with their photocopied autographs on the back.  The other was a color headshot of Fred himself in a vibrant pinkish/magenta polo shirt on a blue background.  He looked so cute.  On the back was his autograph with a line that said...crap...it's escaping me right now.  At the time, I didn't even think that a production assistant probably read my letter and stuffed my SASE with the two mass produced postcards.  I thought, Fred probably read this and ordered that I get those.  I was glowing!  Teresa was jealous, but I think shortly thereafter, she received her SASE with the two postcards as well.  The years passed, and my crush for Fred dwindled, but I still held onto those postcards.  They served as a reminder of a time when I was so innocent, so trusting in others (the entertainment industry even), and I thought anything was possible if I believed in or wanted it bad enough.  Why am I recalling all of this?  Tonight, I was contacted by Fred's agent to schedule a meeting for Fred and my boss to discuss the possibility of Fred directing an episode of our show.  He's coming tomorrow.  One o'clock.  I'm picking him up from the parking lot in the golf cart.  Will I tell him of my childhood crush I had or of the postcards that are still in my little girl bedroom at home?  Probably not.  But I will chuckle to myself as I take a corner too sharp, make Fred brace his seat in the cart, and say something funny to make him laugh.  I've gotta act like a nine-year-old for a minute or two, as I'm in L.A. where I never thought I'd be, and fucking Fred Savage is sitting next to me.  Oh, I remembered what Fred "wrote" to me on the back of his postcard.  It said in his barely legible cursive, "May all your years be wonder years.  Love, Fred "  They have been Fred, and they still continue to be.

These stories are  complete with accents and soundbytes, as Art is from Virginia and uses the word Budweiser frequently enough and with such southern nonchalance that it’s worth repeating. He is often quoted as telling a girl:  “You smell like Southern Comfort.”  He got kicked out of a bar for yelling at the bartender to “get him a cold one.”  There was apparently on this particular evening on the University Hill section of Boulder, Colorado wet paint in the hallways at an apartment building referred to with the obligatory college abbreviation speak as “twelve twenty-five.”  It’s next door to a bar.  Art was probably on his twelvth or twentyfifth Budweiser at that point in time.  A paint fight broke out that he wasn’t involved in; short of drunkenly touching a wet wall on his way into the apartment. The police were on their way.    My friends came home that night to find a message on their machine that has thankfully been saved on cassette and burned to CD and filled out with guitar chords during the appropriate pauses and to match the johnny cash-like impromptu that Art created.  “We’ve got a sit-u-a-tion.  Up at twelve-twenty-five.   The cops are here.  In full force. *pause*  John, Jesse, Sarah….lemmetellyouone thing…I came in the door and did two tumble rolls.  But all I know is…   Its ALLLLLL jammmmin’.”  He arrived at their house later after an argument with his girlfriend.  “She kicked me out.” Was all he said.  They weren’t sure what to say.  “I just wanna cold one.” And was already on his way to the fridge.   After college, Art went back to Virginia.  Jesse still keeps in touch with him, and recently told me that Art is working at the Budweiser factory.  As Jesse tells it, in his near-perfect Arthur Hayward virginian matter-of-factness:  “I don’t know why I didn’t think of it sooner.”

I haven't had a lot of experience with dealbreakers, but I do remember one occasion, chatting with a potential gentleman caller who  burst into tears and told me he just wanted someone to hold him and watch Titanic. Not exactly a date, but still a little awkward. I know someone who posts here who had to deal with the "What R U up 2?" emails. The stories are funny and sometimes turn the table....what if you had a dealbreaking habit and never knew? What I liked best about the series was the thought-provoking point that people find dealbreakers because they know they're not supposed to be with that person in the first place. Kind of like one of our last human instincts.

Now I know some of you out there don't steal cable from your neighbors, but this show is excellent.  The best part is the beginning where they bolt around the straight guy's apt/house and play with his knick knacks and throw his clothes and other appalling articles out the window and onto his lawn!  And this guy is in a whirlwind of commotion, not knowing which room to stay in, what to defend and whether to laugh or get shitty!  I love it, plus Kyan, the hair guy, is so hot it makes me bothered :)  In the end, he has a little shingdig to show off his new look to family, friends, or girlf, and the guys watch on at Queer Eye Headquarters, sipping martinis and yelling at him for shaving against the grain.  There have been proposals, meeting the parents, and popping the move-in question as the setting for the "event".  So I recommend wholeheartedly....even guys like it.  Sean has watched with me a couple of times and I have heard a snicker or two....(btw, he bought the new rolling stone the other day with Jess Simpson on the cover and said, "And this is so I can keep up with my long lost twin!"  He relishes the Jessica in him).  So yes, watch every Tuesday at 10 on Bravo!

"Once open a time there was a peses (princess) she was very pretty.  Her name was Law Law.  Bet like nomol (normal) girl she had a problem?  Bet why?  She didn't have any friends.  She was very very sad.  She started to kriy.  Then she had a cockes (cookies ;) and milk.  She falt better.  She whached some tv.  Then went on a walk.  Then she met a boy.  Then they played.

          People ask me all the time what I do with a two-year-old all day.  Actually, I even ask myself that.  So I thought I would post something about it every now and then, and perhaps one of you will be around a 2 y.o. and utilize (Alison, remember how much Mrs. Fitzgerald loved that word?!) this information.  Grace is an unusually easygoing kid, being the fourth child, so maybe all of this won't apply to the average 2 y.o.; I don't know many others.    The first thing I caught on to is that 2 year olds are big imitators, so if you're laughing, then they will be too.  Whenever Grace gets upset or kind of bored, I do something like yell out "Hee hee!" (like Michael Jackson...one day she'll hear his songs and wonder why that hee hee thing is so familiar); Grace is very responsive and loves to yell it out too, and she's getting disturbingly good at it.  Or we sing selections from "I'm sorry Ms. Jackson" or "Giddyup 409."  My personal favorite is saying "And den" like in "Dude, Where's My Car," something she also loves to say.  The best times are when she is really worked up and doesn't feel like playing these games, she'll yell "No and den!!!"  Seriously, without any prompting from me.  It is so funny, I have to hold in my laughter because she is genuinely upset.  I must admit, you can't spend a whole day singing or yelling out random comments, so we also do things like painting, swinging, and cooking.  Today Grace took it upon herself to color the legs of the table with her orange marker...luckily for me, it was a washable marker...I worry at times that I may not be the most convincing parent when trying to discipline a kid because I really find things like that so funny.  Hopefully I wouldn't have laughed had the marker not been washable.    So there's a little peek into kickin' it with a two year old, which reminds me, I never explained the title.  Grace looks like Cindy Lou Hoo, so I started calling her Gracie Lou, and then, following the natural progression of things, Gracie Loudicrous, then just Loudicrous.  Only on special occasions, though.  I certainly wouldn't want her to start repeating that one as her parents may not see the humor in it.

What I do is called a community match, and I have been paired with an 11-year-old girl named Tiffany. We get together every week and just hang out. It's really a lot of fun since I get to pretty much play and act like a little kid.  This Saturday, we went to  urlLink Wonderlab , which is kind of like a smaller version of the Children's Museum in Indianapolis. They have all sorts of science experiments and activities that let kids be creative and learn a little at the same time. I took these pictures of Tiffany when we were building a sculpture with a couple of huge magnets.

Weddings are scary and people are psycho, especially if you don't want to be "traditional," from big decisions to the small ones. (Just speaking from my own experience). I like the web site  urlLink IndieBride , which has some good ideas and thoughts about how to go your own way without making everyone hate you for not wanting to be a Princess Di bride.  It's a very feminist, "for the modern woman" kind of site, and it's a nice alternative to a lot of what's out there. They might have some stuff on the vegeterian wedding meals, which I think Leah mentioned.

I almost choked on my salad a few times.  I had to conceal my laughter because A) It was annoying and B) I have no idea why it's so funny.  By Danny The Squirrel   I'm a squirrel on the go. I've got trees to climb and streets to cross. If anybody asks what keeps me going when squirrel duties pile up, I got one word for them: nuts! I know it's a stereotype that squirrels go crazy for nuts, but in my case, it's 100 percent true. I make no apologies or excuses. Why should I? I fully admit that I love the nuts! Somebody once said the only thing I cared about was nuts. Hey, guilty as charged. And what's wrong with that? Nuts never hurt anybody�at least nobody in squirrel circles. Nuts are delicious! Just stuff a nut into your cheeks, chomp down, and unlock the nutty flavor. Before you know it, you'll be like me�singing the praises of the savory goodness of nutty nuts. I'm not a strong-willed squirrel. If you take a can of nuts and dump them in your backyard, you'd better believe I'm gonna eat those nuts. I won't be polite about it, either. I won't share them with the chipmunks or the birds. No, I will behave like a fool to secure those nuts. I'll shove as many nuts in my mouth as I can fit, and chew as fast as possible to make room for more nuts. If I have some leftover nuts, I'll bury them for later. And let me tell you: If I can't find my nuts, there's going to be some frantic chirping and running around, believe me. I don't care if passersby stop, point, and laugh at my actions. They can call me me all sorts of nut-loving names. I won't stop until I find those nuts. You might say, "Danny, what's the deal with the nuts? Don't you ever want to break out of the mold? Do something a little less expected? Blaze a trail? Why do you just live by the old squirrel standards?"  Well, I've got an answer. It's simple. Ready? Here it is: I love nuts. Acorns in particular. But I love chestnuts, walnuts, and peanuts, too. I'm a nut nut! That's an old joke my dad told me when I was a little kid, and it's funny because it's true. It may be a clich�, but I go crazy for nuts. There's nothing I wouldn't do for nuts. I've been chased by dogs, cats, raccoons, and children while in pursuit of a luscious nut. You'd think I had some sort of death wish, but that's just not the case. I don't know if there are nuts in heaven, so I'm not looking to die. Believe me, I don't do this for the thrills. I do it for the nuts. Just so you don't get the wrong idea, eating nuts isn't all I do. I like to chase other squirrels up and down the trees. I scramble madly up walls using my prehensile claws. Sometimes, I puff up my tail and charge at shadows. And, believe me, I do my share of dashing madly across telephone wires. But when I need to recharge, there's only one thing that can satisfy my hunger. Nuts! And a lot of 'em! Oh, boy! Do you want to make good with me? Then you'd better bust out the nuts. That's the way to this squirrel's heart. Don't worry. You won't offend me if you assume that I eat nuts, because it's true. I do. So do all of my squirrel friends. Admittedly, I eat more than just nuts. There aren't always nuts around, so I make do. Once, I found a half-eaten candy bar in the park. I was hungry, so I ate it. It was all right. But do you know what would have made it better? Nuts. If you had put some almonds or peanuts in that candy bar, it would've really been something. But you know what would've been even better? If you took all the candy out, and just left the nuts. Life is short if you're a squirrel. What do I have? Two, three years? I have to live life to the fullest. I don't want people saying that I didn't take advantage of every opportunity that I had while I skittered around this green earth. If, when I'm gone, you hear someone say, "That Danny, he was a good guy, but he didn't eat many nuts," I insist you set them straight. You tell them that I loved nuts more than anything.  Man, all this talk of nuts is killing me.

      I once was a good writer.  Back in my college days, anyway.  Even my professors seemed to think so...after all, they made me a writing tutor (which, I will admit, was at times no more than trying to explain the complexities of the comma to yet another frat guy).  Perhaps "making it" in such a big way at old DePauw has given me a big head, because now, when it matters most, I am stuck.  I am in the middle of my personal statement for graduate schools, which appears to be a simple enough task.  Don't be fooled (Shan, I'm sure you feel this).  It's a doozy, one of those way-too-general things that's impossible to pin down and write about.  So I putz around while at work, scribble out a few things, and then bring it home and get Jon (also a writing tutor, lucky for me) to help me structure it.  Now I know how to do all of these things too, it's just that I don't want to (perhaps I'm spending too much time with my 2 year old friend Gracie?).  Perhaps what I'll end up doing is taking highlights of my blogs-maybe some of yours too, because I just don't have that many-, pasting them together, and turning that in as my statement.    To be honest, the personal statement doesn't worry me all that much.  I'll buckle down and get it done this weekend because I have to.  What does worry me is actually getting in to grad school and having to write again on a regular basis.  What am I doing when I decided to go to grad school, you may wonder?  Putting off the real world, that's what...doing exactly what I do best.

Jenny, if you haven't seen this movie, check it out, it's great and boasts some fantastic 80's music and spirit fingers courtesy of--you got it--Sparkle Motion!   So, since there are limited shopping days until Christmas, I made this easy on you. You can buy me this awesome  urlLink Sparkle Motion  Jumpsuit. For only $89.95, you'll be able to outfit me in "Sparkle Slinky plush swirl in solid slinky black with jazz or palazzo pants"...your choice. Delivery takes 9-10 weeks, so get on it!  OR, if you'd rather have me decorate my room like I was a teenage member of 'Degrassi,' (that's a shoutout to you, Byron) go for the  urlLink Sparkle Motion lava lamp . Again color is up to you, but I'll have you know, that this lamp "offers soothing and relaxation with a twist" AND "these beautiful sparkles send color dancing all over! Sit back and enjoy." Don't mind if I do. Bonus! It's on sale for $14.50     I know it's not quiz day yet, but this visual quiz,  urlLink The Write Stuff , from Film Wise features still shots of notes from various movies. Obviously, you've got a leg up with this one. Maybe you're even 'Head over Heels' by now!

The purse comes with a stuffed piece of toast that is also available for $10 on its own.  If you really like toast, its a great little stuffed animal.  I will be submitting my new line of stationary and journals to Cut + Paste very soon.  It is called "Papal Mache" and features a rubber stamped Pope on all the  cards and all the journals.  There will also be a little empty word bubble next to the Pope so you can write in your own little greeting.  Maybe he's saying "Happy Birthday" on a particular card, or maybe he's saying "Use condoms!"  (That probably won't ever happen, but on your Pope stationary IT CAN!!

Upon receipt of the e-mail, Widmar mentally raced through the contents of his blog.

Its a great little film.  Watch it. Now.

      Sunday was perhaps my most fun night ever at Sullivan's steakhouse....not b/c of the dough, but b/c of the people I worked with and the way the evening went.  First off, Sundays are notoriously slow and usually the crew consists of the newest kids on the block.  I am now the oldest of the newest kids, wahoo!  Anyway, so it's low key and fun....what was especially lovely about this night was we had certain sections of the restaurant blocked off b/c we have fewer servers (8 as compared to 16)....but the hostess could NOT figure it out.  She kept seating the wrong sections and being like, "Yeah, that might not be your section, but that's your table," and seating people in one person's section and giving that table to another person.  While some people were beyond irritated with her stupidity, I just laughed and got a kick out it!  I mean, there were MAYBE 10 tables in the restaurant.  To her discredit, she also had a seating chart, like map of who was where and the blocked sections were blacked out.        Anyway, I am leaving with my whopping $40 for the night and who do I RUN into on my way out?  Kato Kaelin, the world's most infamous houseguest.  Yup, definitely bumped into him and was like, " Uh, sorry."  Did a double take and asked the valet guy if that was Kato.  And it was.....in Indianapolis, on a Sunday, at my crazy restaurant.  I only wonder where he sat.

      So once again, the delinquent blogger is back.  This time I am armed with a somewhat acceptable reason: I realized a few weeks ago that I was really behind on my grad school apps (which are taking a ridiculously long time to finish...every school has a slightly different angle on the same old question and they all have random, weird things to do.  I applaud ASU and IU for the simplicity of their applications; every other school could learn a few things from them.)  The most exciting part about the application process is the prospect of moving somewhere WARM (CA, AZ, or FL).  I hate old man weather and jack frost and the rest of the crew; I am already dealing with my first cold of the year.  I'm just not cut out for cold weather, I tell you what.       Since I last blogged, I have realized a couple things: 1), I don't know why there's so much hype about the Blue Man Group.  I liked STOMP better (and let's face it, that's just more fun to say); I loved the parts in BMG when they're drumming or playing the pipes (that sounds gross but how else do I put it???), but then there's parts like when they are spewing cereal everywhere during which I sat and wondered, is the 40+ crew sitting behind us only laughing because they're all drunk?  Or do they actually find this funny?  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that if any of their kids were to "get creative" like the Blue Men and spew cereal all over the kitchen table at breakfast, they wouldn't find it quite so entertaining.  Hmm.  2), I like parties with beer and doritos (Ali, are you drooling yet?)  much, much better than ones with champagne and silly snacks like "baked apples drizzled with cherries stewing in brandy all day."  You're probably wondering, why the hell were you doing at the latter party?!  Rolling my eyes, that's what.  Jon's friend Adam had a party in his swanky North End apt; Adam is very cool, but one of Adam's friends Monica (who pranced around all night in a pink shirt with a big bow on it and a chain belt with a pink rhinestone M on it) wants to be an event coordinator and insisted on making this party very "adult."  Now when has anything adult added up to big fun?  Never yet, and it hasn't started.  I hope I never become the kind of person that genuinely thinks I'm having fun at such a function.  Instead, I hope I become a prankster at such parties who adds a little Everclear to the cherries or replaces Monica's M with a gorilla pendant or something along those lines.    I have a couple recommendations for the blogging crew and our avid readers: the book "The Essential Difference" by Simon Baron-Cohen and online dvd rental services like Netflix.  "The Essential Difference" is this really cool book that addresses the differences between the typical male and female brains and how hormones present prenatally (like testosterone) affect brain development.  Very cool, and it's not as psycho-babbly as you might expect.  The online dvd thing is just really convenient for anyone who likes to kick it on occasion (or, perhaps nightly) with a video and a box of junior mints (sorry, I am really hungry right now)...we tried walmart's but they take awhile to ship so I'd recommend Netflix.  Also, if anyone has any movie suggestions, please let me know!

I listened to a few interviews with Shearer and Guest on the NPR archives...so funny.  They are probably the most talented people in show business, as they are writers, actors, directors AND musicians and songwriters.  Guest said that Parker Posey learned the manodlin for  A Mighty Wind  and Catherine O'Hara learned the "Autoharp" (thats an instrument I could see Katie playing, no?) and that Eugene Levy hadn't played a guitar in 30 years so he had to re-learn.  In the concert sequences, they are really playing.  I can't get over how cool that is.  Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of many Simpsons characters (including Mr. Burns AND Smithers, which i think is funny) has website,   urlLink Harry Shearer .  On there you can find out about his radio show "Le Show," which is in its 19th year on public radio.  He hosts it and does political and social commentary every week.  How much would I love to have that job!!! On the site there is a link to "found objects" which include sound bytes of like Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer trying to ad lib with each other for the first episode of whatever show they have.  There are also many with Dan Rather acting like a nut.  One piece has him discussing his hair while on location in Soweto.  I guess when you're in post-apartheid S.Africa you just want to make sure you never become uncoiffed.

Sorry, it's Monday. Saturday night was the tribute show for  urlLink Tom Donahue , owner of TD's CDs and LPs and big supporter of the Bloomington music scene. He had to close down his store this fall to receive cancer treatment, and sadly, he passed away last week.  The show was held at Vertigo and consisted of several bands covering all sorts of Beatles tunes, some better than others. The place was packed and served as a great testament to how many people's lives this man touched.      While I was there, I took this picture of a drawing on one of the bathroom stalls. I thought it was kind of different, so I'm going to take some more pictures of graffiti as I happen upon it.

Chicago PBS airs the BBC's show   urlLink Coupling ,  which NBC tried to spin off without any success. The NBC version was really really bad, but the BBC version is great- absolutely hilarious. If you get the show on your public tv or any other station, tune in. It's in no way the new Friends like everyone wanted the NBC version to be.   Coupling  is mostly about sex, which Friends really can't do to much with at this point- it's all getting a little incestuous. The show was actually  urlLink banned  in some places, including Indiana! I guess the Hoosier state is just not ready for frank breast talk, but MTV is cool.

According to this young stud's account, he mentioned (ahem, lied) that he was a listener and,  "When I said this, her cheeks flushed, her pupils dialated and her lips became engorged. Several hours later we were humping like bunnies in her apartment. Now she's my girlfriend."   Blogger Brendan explains to this fellow that NPR is some sort of mating ritual:  "For both the male and the female, listening to NPR sends a signal to a prospective mate: 'Despite my current income, in a few years I will have a house in a neighborhood with good public schools, and I will drive a Volvo stationwagon.' Women are sending an additional signal: 'I consider myself smart and sophisticated and if I get pregnant, I will have an abortion. I might consider a three-way.' Men signal back: 'I won't try to stop you from getting an abortion, but I'm not afraid to cry if you do. I don't like guns, but I'm manly enough to camp and mountain-bike. I just love nature! A three-way sounds intriguing.'   Heh. I'm not gonna lie. I find the NPR monotone about as boring as the faux listener (excepting the wonderful Cah Tawlk), but I guess I can see the swooning girl's point. I once dated a guy who didn't even know what NPR was, and that was a disaster of it's own special breed. I guess maybe I'm just a better listener than reader.   On another note, the illustration comes from the quaint and funny site,  urlLink Toothpaste for Dinner .

So yesterday afternoon I got to see a new exhibit at the Indiana University Art Museum,  urlLink Imaging Blackness: 1915-2002 . It was a collection of film posters from the Indiana University Black Film Center/Archive. Basically, the exhibit served to mark the changes in the way African Americans have been represented in film over the years. Of course, the shift from black movies being separate from mainstream film to more universally accepted movies that happen to star African Americans was obvious but still worth noting. The artwork on the posters was really fascinating, though. I enjoyed seeing such a large collection of movie posters that spanned so much time. They really told a story about how a section of cinema has evolved over the years yet has maintained the aesthetic values that work to gather an audience.

We wake up to find our bedroom lit up with red light and look out the window to see the apartment building across the street on fire. Firemen were talking through these huge bullhorns on their trucks right outside our windows.   As only Alison knows, we live on a fake street, because our block has been paved over to make a little "park" with little gardens. The firetrucks, ambulances, etc. were all parked right outside our windows because there it is just one big paved area, and the hydrant happens to be in directly across from our place as well. So, there was action all night and into the morning-- our bedroom was a kind of creepy disco with all the red lights.   It's a pretty sad situation- one person died and over 100 people have no place to live right now. The Red Cross has a little station set up outside and is serving breakfast, but apparently the homeless people are trying to cut in on that so the police are also here keeping order.   I did not sleep at all last night so I am all wired, which is probably why I feel compelled to blog this story. I've never really had a fire be so close to my house before, so it's a little scary.

      this weekend i had an epiphany.  something funny, disturbing, but true.  my boyfriend, sean, and jessica simpson are birds of a feather....perhaps that is why i am obsessed with her antics.  i have compiled a list of reasons why:  *i don't think sean could name a brand of tuna, not even chicken of the sea.  i also don't think jessica could either until that incident.    *sean and jessica both love shopping more than humanly possible and sported the "trucker hat" with much enthusiasm. plus, nothing is too expensive for their tastes ($700 underwear?)  *this past wednesday, when sean was leaving the gas station, he forgot to remove the pump from his car before driving off.  common mistake....if you're jessica or sean.  *sean's mother still does his laundry (sometimes) and ironing....does jessica know what a lint trap is?  *in a conversation about children (not ours, in general), sean remarks that he will trade his car for a minivan when expecting his first child.  why?  b/c kids need "a lot of metal surrounding them to protect them in an accident" and because "babies are important!".  apparently my toyota corolla is not safe for children, but jessica's suv will do the trick!  *i had a cold last week, cough, whatnot.  sean asks me is i could be pregnant and i respond with something like a "wha?" and he replies that women get sick before they find out they are pregnant and i am sick, so could i be pregnant?  i calmed him by telling him that morning sickness is defined by symptoms of barfing and nausea, not sniffling and coughing.  i bet jessica would have already peed on the stick.  *sean and jessica still love and admire 98 degrees, okay i made that one up :)    there are more, but i will not bore you.  overall, i am not dating a complete nutball, he just has his "jessica" moments that make me laugh.  if nothing else, i do respect nick lachey for taking the plunge with jess and having an idea of what he had to deal with to hit it with that hottie!

Which often requires explanation.  “So what kind of food is it?” people ask, to which I want to slowly reply ‘Asian Fuuuussssion’.  “Well, it’s a mix of all the Asian cuisines with other western cuisines.”  Or I often say “Its Asian flavors and French Preparation.”  The funny thing is that a lot of the people who ask don’t even know what French preparation means.   They usually don’t look satisfied with our exchange.  But I usually am.  Because I’m right.    We serve the sake in little boxes which is traditional I guess.  Although I think the traditional boxes are wooden and ours are plastic and dishwasher safe.  And were probably a promo of some kind from the sake company.  The real wooden ones are now relegated to holding packets of various sweeteners that we cringe when people ask for.  Because it’s an extra trip to the table and back.  When I was trained about the sake and the wine and all the other various libations, I was instructed that the right way is to pour the box to just the point where it overflows.  I hear the word ‘meniscus’ in my head and visualize middle school science classes spent dropping water onto a penny until the surface tension could take no more.   I’m also taught to instruct the often confused and self conscious diners that yes this was done on purpose and that it is considered good luck in Japan.  I don’t think they believe me because people who burp at the table have often said that burping is considered a compliment in some countries and we all know that’s a cop out.  This guy wants to make a point of the fact that he knows how sake is traditionally supposed to be poured in Japan. “We’ll have two more Silvers.” He says, “and this time, can I have a ‘real’ pour?”  Although I know exactly what he’s referring to, I look at him blankly.”  After a few seconds of forced confusion I say something like “Oh, ok.”  That is all I can muster.  I then go back to the fridge when the sake is and kick the door.  Something I have only done once or twice at the restaurant.  Naturally my manager wants to know what’s going on.  I describe the last 2 minutes I spent with table 3.    “So let him be right.” My manager says.   I pour the two boxes of sake with the meniscus in mind.  I know that as I walk out to the table, the boxes will indeed overflow.  As I set them down on the table he gives me this “come on” kind of look that says I’m in the wrong.  Again.  We have a brief discussion about the finer points of sake pouring.  I contain my rage by pretending to be dumb.  Then I spend the rest of the time they are dining bitching with my coworkers about how people like to have their power trips even if they have to play out as pathetically as this.  After they’ve left, I bus their table.  I’m pretty sure he must have left me a tip that will reflect his superiority and my inferiority.  A tip to say:  I was right about the sake.  And you were wrong.”        He left me a great tip.  Maybe it was his way of thanking me for letting him flex his intelligence in front of his wife or girlfriend.  I’ll never really know.  Customers come into restaurants.  Servers serve them.  It all seems pretty cut and dry.  But in reality, there is often a lot more going on that just that.  It is the battle between ‘the customer is always right’, and ‘the server works here so naturally knows a lot more than you do.’  Everyone wants to be right.  I mean, look at how transparent it is right now?  But really, who wants to be wrong?  Being right is as close as any of us come to measuring our progress is life. Our parents were always right.  So were our teachers, and our coaches, and our more worldly friends.  So now, as adults we finally want to be the ones who are right, and who are teaching others the ways of the world.  If only we could all just be a little nicer about it.

Suddenly, a loud British voice booms, "Is that the new Onion you've got there, eh?" I turn around and see a funny guy in a huge puffy parka (by the way, it's cold here) looking super jazzed. I say, "Um, yeah, I guess it is." Sidenote: At this point in my Chicago residency, whenever anyone I don't know talks to me, I immediately assume they want to kill me or be perverted or something. That;s why I don't appear too friendly in this story.  End sidenote. The guy freaks out over the Onion: "Can I see it? Just for a second?" I show him the paper. He sighs, "It's great. Really beautiful." I suddenly notice the British accent has dissapeared and I have no interest in talking to him.  I start to walk faster in order to leave puffy parka in the dust. He speeds up to follow me. "Two Onion lovers should really be together," he says. I ignore him and scoot along home, and as I round the corner, I notice puffy parka sadly shuffling away in the opposite direction. This turned out better than the guy who followed me all the way home one day.   There is a cool Ira Glass interview in the Onion this week. Check it out. Also, Aly, the Pushstars are going to be here on the 12th. You should come!

Does anyone know when his new book is coming out?  John and I just put on one of his stories while we're eating dinner and just laugh.  But not with food in our mouths.

          This morning I was doing my usual jackaround activities to start my day at work: check messages, check my work email, check personal email, read blog, read online news....what have you.  And I stumbled across this beauty of an article  urlLink   that reminded me of my encounter with a canadian goose a couple of years back.  I was driving to work and   this goose bolts out of nowhere and jumps beneath my car.  I hit the tricky bastard and was so upset that I stopped to check on the fella.  He was shitty, as you would be, but lively.  I called information get a hold of animal control and bandage up the squaking bird and later came to find that he only suffered a broken wing.  Good for the goose.  But what baffles me about the article is how does a Canadian Goose damage an airplane?   urlLink   urlLink    side note: i cannot figure out how to link this since i am blogging illiterate, but it's in the editorials at indystar.com

Over the past year and a half I have learned spanish and gained an understanding and appreciation for the sacrifices that so many Mexican immigrants in our country make just to have better lives for their families.

WE KNOW YOU LIKE THE BAND! THAT'S WHY YOU ARE AT THE FUCKING SHOW CHAMP! HOW MUCH OF ONE BAND DO YOU REALLY NEED?! Actually just don't be the four buff guys in the Jeep at the show� period.

There wasn't much for me to do, so I took some pictures around the turbines. It was a really beautiful sunny (and hella windy!) day, and all the colors seemed to be especially bright and vibrant. There were these metal tags on all of the meters that would clang against the metal pipes and sound like wind chimes. Pretty much I was all alone at this substation that only takes about four people to run. It was a weird sensation.

After talking to Alison this weekend (super fun day on Michigan Ave. and snacktacular snacks at the Rainforest Cafe, you WANKER!), I realized I am pretty out of it when it comes to new authors.

Where did it come from? Who made it? I always think about it when I pass by each day. I'm pretty sure I wasn't there this summer, but I decided to stop since it's gorgeous out and take a closer look at it. The sculpture seems to have been created within a large brick enclosure that has drains and collects dirty water. I don't know what its original purpose might have been. There are drains at the bottom of the brick wall, but it seems like an odd place to put a fountain. On the side of a highway next to a motel with nothing aesthetically pleasing about it. I'll try to look into it.   This woman upside down falling was my favorite part:   The beauty for no reason makes me think of Antoni Gaudi's  urlLink Park Guell  in Barcelona.

A federal appeals court  urlLink has ruled nude Barbie photos constitute free speech  (via  urlLink Gothamist ). The pictures, created by Utah artist Thomas Forsythe, depict the blonde icon in various entanglements with kitchen appliances (the exhibit is called "Food Chain Barbie"). While the concept is really obvious and not that original--Barbie is trapped in the kitchen and her femininity is not an asset but a liability because it's used to keep her in stereotypical "women's" roles--it's a great stride in free speech. It's also interesting that the government and pretty much the entire world sees Barbie as much more than a plastic product but as a symbol for so many things, these days mostly bad.  As many people know, Barbie is orignially from Germany and was not initally intended as a children's toy, but was sold at bars as a sexy item for grown men.  urlLink The history and evolution  of Barbie is an insightful read. It seems she went straight from a sexual figure to the oft-idolized Donna Reed-esque houswife. I'm sure there are really interesting virgin/whore implications there. More and more often, Barbie is being used to mock the housewife/physical feminine prefection ideals and to make social commentary. Check out  urlLink Suicide Bomber Barbie  or  urlLink an anorexic Karen Carpenter  Barbie. And who can forget  Aqua's song  urlLink 'Barbie Girl' , which incedentally won a suit Mattel filed against the group, claiming the song hurt sales.   Anyway, it's not Friday yet, but since there was no quiz last week, this one seems fitting for the post:  urlLink If you were a Barbie, which Messed-Up Version would You be ? I am, for some reason, Transgender Barbie. Just call me Al if I'm not in a dress. Excuse, me, it's 2 pm and that means I have to go shave my Adam's apple again.

It was  a splendid time, and I got to see some people I missed as well as meet some fun friends of Janel's. It's lame, but the coolest part of the night for me was when a cat that lives across the street showed up and kicked it for a while. Unfortunately, I didn't get any pictures. According to some people, the cat (Jake) left and came back with a kitty friend of his, but I missed that too. DAMN! Another highlight was Luke's contribution of hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps. Way to be, Luke!  Here are some more snapshots of the night:    Everyone mingles (or not).    Janel eyes some shady stuff going on by the blender. I think this is the pina colada I ended up drinking later. Janel's gum was at the bottom. A special surprise like when they put a gummy bear at the bottom of your ice cream waffle cone so it doesn't leak...only way more grody.      Matt gets in (yet another) picture. Stewart is a great guy who carved our turkey at the last party. Unfortunately the kitchen has not recovered and has a turkey fat funk smell to it.    Yo, MTV raps! This is the cover to my forthcoming album, 4-eva. You know, cuz there's four of us and um...nevermind. But the boys in my band be Mike, Maddox and Luke.

         I went to the Simon and Garfunkel concert Saturday night, and wow, it was incredible.  The best thing about it was the crowd...mostly in their 50s and 60s, some still tokin', and so excited to be there.  I kept thinking how psyched I would be if in 30 years DMB had a reunion tour.  I guess that's what Sat. night was like for those grown-up hippies.  There were some noteworthy outbursts of enthusiasm: two times, when the entire crowd was seated, there would be one individual in one of the first few rows standing up busting a move all by him/herself (probably secretly hoping to be invited up on stage).  The first time, no one else joined in, but during "Mrs. Robinson," pretty much everybody got up to shake their tailfeathers.  I just have to say, Paul Simon does write some absolutely incredible songs, but he certainly isn't very nice to Art.  Poor brillopad-hair Art kept going on about their friendship and how great Paul and his songs were, and Paul would be like, "Yeah I know.  I am pretty cool.  You on the other hand..."  That may not be verbatim, but that was the general feeling I got, which was disappointing.  At any rate, it was one of the coolest concerts I've ever seen.

      To aid Alison in the presentation of her award-worthy blog, I will use caps :)  HOW'S THAT FOR YOU?  Just kidding.....Anyway, today's selection for excellent children's book is  Diary of a Wombat  by Jackie French, illustrated by Bruce Whatley.  I find this book exceptional because it informs children of other animals of the world, namely Australia, and is just adorable.       Here is brief decription:  What, exactly, do wombats do all day? One enterprising wombat answers that question and a few others in diary form in French's (No Such Thing) tongue-in-cheek picture book. After explaining his unique Australian heritage, the star of this volume paints a funny, if rather dull, picture of his daily routine. "Monday Morning: Slept./Afternoon: Slept./ Evening: Ate grass./ Scratched./ Night: Ate grass." Things begin to perk up, however, when the wombat discovers its new human neighbors. Before long, the always-hungry creature is at their door begging for food (preferably carrots or oats), digging in their garden ("Began new hole in soft dirt") and turning his neighbors' belongings into scratching posts. Happily, the human family appears to take the antics of their adopted wild "pet" in stride (though the wombat sees things a bit differently "Have decided that humans are easily trained and make quite good pets").   Thank you amazon.com....the illustrations are fabulous and cute and I found myself rooting for this pesky creature and his quest for carrots, something I might not say if it was entitled "Diary of a Possum".  Check this out next time you are visiting Borders or Barnes and Noble.

      There are two acceptable spellings of gre/ay, and in my mind, they are completely different colors (colours, if you will).  I'm just wondering if this is just something I've dreamed up out of nowhere or if anyone else is feeling me on this.  Someone can have grey eyes, but not gray eyes.  You can have a gray car, but not a grey one.  I picture grey as a soft, watercolor color but gray as a harsh, marker color (once again, I do spend a lot of time with a toddler).  Grey is clearly the more poetic of the two colors; gray is the one with the more negative connotation.  So you can't have a grey day, but you can have a gray day.  *side note: I just looked down and realized I have a gray shirt on!*  Here are some examples just so you can see I'm not crazy:       "Brunette hair, Grey Blue eyes and is dressed to Thrill, in a beautiful Peach Gown with White Lace."  "I can see through the mist of your gray blue eyes. You have a hidden feeling, and you don't know what to say." some fine online poetry by J.J. Anne Marie Loeffler (could this be Jill "Birthday Song" Loeffler?)  P.S. Who gets their "thrills" from porcelain dolls?!  I looked up "grey blue eyes" and this is one thing that came up.

Take a look at this  urlLink Year in Review  for a compilation of best-of lists covering just about any subject. Who knows? Maybe  I Love Guinea Pigs  is on the New York Time's Best Nonfiction Books of 2003.

       I see a trend of year-end top 10s of this year, so I am going with the flow and creating my "book of the week", hopefully day, but we shall see how busy I am pretending to be at work (actually, I am quite busy these days, so I have shed my wolf costume!).  As you may know, I am a children's literacy coordinator, so I will be reporting on children's books.  perhaps this will only provide immediate assistance to Jenny, but the rest of you can refer to this when you have your own bundle of joy (to babysit, raise, whatever).        Week/day one: I Love Guinea Pigs  by Dick King-Smith (hee hee Dick King) and illustrated by Anita Jeram I find this book especially poignant since, while in New Zealand, Brett and I were doing what we do best one night: sitting around with a doobie chatting about nonsense while Jenny and John hid from us.  Now you might know the silliness that comes from these kinds of conversations, but this is classic.  we are talking about guinea pigs and I suggested that somewhere, there is a wild guinea pig.  The Good Lord did not just create the guinea pig in an aquarium lined with wood chips and an annoyingly loud water bottle, no, there are wild guinea pigs.  Can you imagine hiking along and hearing the rustling of bushes by your feet and out runs a wild guinea pig?  So we had many a laugh and were sharing our joy with Jenny and John the next day at dinner.  The icing on the cake was Jenny getting all serious and saying, "Well yes, there are wild guinea pigs.  I had to write a report for Joyce and John Tarbox about guinea pigs before I could own one."  Ah, the Tarbox family....      At a recent book sale, I spotted "I Love Guinea Pigs" and had to buy it.  In case you were wondering, there  are  wild guinea pigs.  They were first introduced to North America by Spanish sailors about 400 years ago.  Their origin was from a country in South America called Dutch Auiana, hence "Guiana Pigs."  Also, guinea pigs do not have tails and are not actually pigs.   some other interesting guinea pigs facts: • The latin name for guinea pig is  cavia porcellus  (it means piggy-looking cavy)  • Guinea pigs enjoy a variety in their diet, so include cabbage, carrots, apples, and clover as well as pellets • If you "handle them regularly, and carry them around, stroke them, talk to them....they bcome really fond of you"  • Some things a guinea pig might say: "putt", "chut", "tweet", and "drr" • Baby guinea pigs are born fully furred, eyes open, and with teeth!  If you would like to find out more, read "I Love Guinea Pigs."  It includes little references about guinea pigs previously owned by the author.  His two favorites were King Arthur and Beach Boy, both Abyssinians.  Touching stories, I tell you.  You should already own this book!

Instead of music though, ive decided to list my top books and magazines of the year.  As the title of this post might suggest,  I actually haven't finished hardly any of these books.  I have serious ADD when it comes to reading, which probably explains my love of magazines.  I will go to a bookstore and literally read like 10 magazines in the course of a few hours.  At any rate hardly any (if any) of these selection were published in 2003, but this post is about me, and what I liked this year so without further adieu, here are my top publications of 2003.             Nylon  is probably the best girl magazine ive come across.  I have had subscriptions to all the usual suspects:  Cosmo, Instyle, Glamour, Lucky, you name it.  When they come it probably takes me 15 minutes to thumb through the somewhat cute clothes and past the obligatory articles about women in foreign countries that don't have the luxury of reading vapid magazines like these, an article about someone getting raped, killed, kidnapped, or often all three.  Then since im really in a sexy mood there are plenty of articles about how to please, keep, or get a man.  Pleasing a man isn't rocket sciene Cosmo.  Pleasing a women on the other hand, might be like string theory or something.   The purpose of this rant is to explain that  Nylon  is NONE of these things.  Its also not like BUST, Ms or any of the other more lesbian leaning alternative girl mags.   Nylon  is sweet.            The Culture of Fear which is subtitled "Why Americans are Afraid of the Wrong Things: Crime, Drugs, Minorities, Teen Moms, Killer Kids, Mutant Microbes, Plane Crashes, Road Rage & so much more) was actually published in 1999.  Quite a while before Sept 11.  This book appealed the hypochondriac  in me.  Hey, I have a vivid imagination and way too much energy with no where to go but with wandering thoughts. The sociologist that wrote this book claims that most americans are burdeoned with  overblown fears.  *whew*  I think basically he thinks its "the man" for lack of a better phrase who is behind it all.  Americans are so fucked.  Wish I was european.  Easier said than done.            Done.  This book made me European.  Ok, just kidding, but  The Power of Now  is supposed to aid in the quest toward enlightenment and quietness within the mind.  What? I couldn't hear that with all the worries talking over each other.   To summarize the inside jacket cover:   "We are  not  our mind." "  ...can be used to bring us into the Now, the present moment, where problems do not exist.  It is here we find our joy and are able to ebrace our true selves.  It is here we discover that we are already complete and perfect. "  Everyone in john's family has read this book including john, who told me it really changed his life.  To me, he is like the little buddha...so much more enlightened than me.  But i suppose that's not a very buddhist way to look at it anyways.  Either way, I need to read this book.  Im on page 23 and I do like it  quite a bit.  I can see how with practice I will learn to quiet my mind.  New Agey skeptics:  suck it up. this book is the straight dope.           CMYK Magazine  is a bi monthly showcase of student talent in Advertising, Design, Photography and Illustration.  It's available at all major bookstores.  All the interns send stuff to them and some have gotten in.  Hopefully you'll see me in there soon.  I always freak when it comes out.  The advertising portion is a bit lackluster, but im jealous too so im biased.  The photography is AMAZING             I can just lump all of these trashy novels as one pick.  These books are the justin timberlake of literature.  Never admit it.   Yes, I'm admitting it right now, but that's ok, its just the internet.  Jaqueline Susann is as 60's as it gets.  Valley of the Dolls is her most famous but the others are equally sinful.  She writes a pretty hard to put down novel for the beach, plane ride, christmas vacation...basically anywhere no one you know will see you.  Get these books.  Or don't ;)             I have to regain your respect.  I DO read the  Economist.   And I LOVE it.  I got a subscription to this magazine for christmas last year and wish I was continuing it, but its really $$$ and I probably only read half of them.  A weekly publication thats as dense as the  Economist  can be a bit daunting.  This is a great thing to pick up when youre flying or something and need to catch up on what's going on in the world, without the rose colored lenses of FOX-network like trash such as TIME, Newsweek and US NEWS and World Report.  The Economist has a decidedly british slant, but a liberal one, so you can be sure tony blair gets his, just like george bush does.  There are stories you would NEVER hear about anywhere else.  I always feel smarter when I finish this mag.                "MAN BITES TOWN"  is a collection of essays Harry Shearer wrote for the LA Times.  He is so fucking awesome.  I ordered this book on amazon used because it is out of print.  I dont even have it yet and im putting on the list.  Im THAT sure of it.  Whenever I listen to his show on KCRW Santa Monica (brilliantly titled "Le Show") I always say the same thing.  "When I grow up, I want to be a satirist."           FADER is my new favorite music magazine.  They had an amazing outkast article that really gave me an insight into the dichotomy that is their brand of coolness.  I dont know if its a british mag or not...either way its packed full of articles about bands you'd care about, and find out about new ones too.   The covers are always really awesome.  I judge books by their covers.        I'm guessing by now everyone has read this book.  But if you haven't you really should immediately.  Everyone I know has had the same laughing out loud reaction to this book that I had.  In a world as cynical as this (or maybe its just me.....) how many things make you laugh out loud, aside of thinking of funny things at inappropriate moments.  This book makes me want to be a writer.          Imagine flooding the Grand Canyon so we can all have more power.  That was exactly what the Glen Canyon Dam did in the 60's.  The Monkey Wrench Gang is one of the best books ive read in a long time.  In the west the auther Edward Abbey holds almost mythical status.  His book has inspired a lot of criticism from environmental groups like the Sierra Club for being too radical.  After Sept 11, they yanked a kid off the plane for having this book in his bag.  It was on "THE LIST."  Pretty scary.  John grew up in the west as did his parents.  They all remember when the west was a lot less developed, and a lot more beautiful.  When the government decided to flood Glen Canyon  to make a dam to power LA, Vegas and Phoenix they killed an entire ecosystem.  And people in the west were fucking pissed for lack of a better way to say it.  The characters in the book fight back the machines by sabotaging them. The book is fictional but the characters are based on real people the events are a bit more grandiose than the real ones.     My friend grew up in Utah (where this dam is) and his mother was a librarian and would not allow him to read the book because she knew he would go out and mimic the characters.  Talk about civil disobedience.  This book made me feel like individuals CAN make a difference in society.  How cool.

          This picture could have been me this past Sunday afternoon.  Boston had a crazy "noreaster" (if I hear that cheesy word one more time I'm going to call in and complain to all of the news stations!) this past weekend, and being the intelligent kids we are, both Jon and I had our cars in the city Friday night when the storm started.  Hey, we wanted to go out, and a little snow wasn't going to hold us back.  Weatherfolk always exaggerate anyway, right?  Not this time.  Saturday morning rolls around and lucky for us Hornet (aka Dancing Brian...smiles from Jennie...I saw his dance troupe Sat. night!  The BDE!) had an SUV and was able to take us home.  We came back on Sunday armed with shovels when the snow finally let up to unearth our cars...I actually thought the wrong car was mine, initially.  It took over an hour to get them out.  Goodtimes, I tell you.  Everyone walking along the street (and there were plenty of them, heading to the grocery store or trolling *thank you Tish* about on snowshoes or cross-country skis) feels compelled to dispense advice on the best way to get the cars out.  I say, if you have a better way to do it, grab the shovel and demonstrate!  The point of this story is, snow is fun but shoveling is not.  Also, I have strong arms from all that shoveling so don't mess with me.  Mmmm hmm.

While I try to expose myself to as much music as possible, this list isn't very diverse because I don't buy CD's very often. So pretty much everyone on this list is a white guy or a group of white guys, so obviously this is by no means a difinitive list of what's good in 2003. I mean, can you take someone who doesn't even have the new Outkast CD yet seriously? Yeah, I didn't think so. Anyway, here they are. Not the best of the best, but some damn good music anyway.    10. The Long Winters- When I Pretend to Fall.  I went to a show at the Patio a Death Cab for Cutie fan and left a Long Winters fan. Singer John Roderick has a great raspy, yet melodic voice and looks a little like Philip Seymour Hoffman to boot. Seeing this band live really put them over the top for me. They were musically tight, energetic and very funny. This is indie rock that is definitely post-emo. A few people around me were even smiling. Members of this supergroup come from other bands including Harvey Danger, Built to Spill, the Posies, Sunny Day Real Estate and even Death Cab for Cutie. Song highlights include 'Scared Straight' and 'Scent of Lime' from their 2002 release The Worst You Can Do is Harm.       9. Death Cab for Cutie- Transatlanticism.  2003 has been a big year for Ben Gibbard, but his songs have remained grounded in his typical relationship-turned-sour muck as always. Unlike Chris Carraba of Dashboard Confessional, however, Gibbard makes his brand of break-up music appealing with intelligent lyrics and really lovely melodies. So far, his talent and soft delivery have kept the sing-along TRL set away from Death Cab, but I can hear MTV salivating after this Buzzworthy 'new' band. I wonder which song will be the new 'Screaming Infidelities?' My vote is on the upbeat-with-handclaps 'The Sound of Settling' or 'The New Year.' Ugh. I can hear squeaky-teenage boys' voices cracking already on the new 'DCFC Unplugged.'       8. Pernice Brothers- Yours Mine & Ours.  This is a gorgeous album, and like the two previous bands listed, I also saw the Pernice Brothers and was highly impressed by their live performance. Joe Pernice's voice is a ringer for Elvis Costello's, and the group's songs have a similar yearning quality. At the same time, however, the Pernice Brothers have a distinctive sound that is incredibly beautiful and smooth. It's the sound someone's voice makes as it catches then breaks and they begin to cry. But with less drama. The music immediately soothes the voice and there is nothing left to do but listen. Song picks: 'Blinded by the Stars' and 'Judy.' Also try 'Overcome by Happiness' from the 1998 album of the same name or anything from 2001's The World Won't End.       7. Sea & Cake- One Bedroom.  Sam Prekop whispers, but the layers of lush music from Sea & Cake come together to create a mighty but subtle force. Each song is complex and doesn't rely on the common verse, chorus, verse of many pop songs. A force of nature, this album washes over you like a wave or gust of wind. The band uses organic instruments, but an electronic feel permeates this and the group's other albums. One Bedroom is a rare example of a work so unique it has the potential to appeal to a wide array of listeners. Check out 'Shoulder Length' or 'Le Baron' or their cover of David Bowie's 'Sound and Vision.' My favorite song is 'The Transaction' from 1995's The Biz.        6. Royksopp- Melody A.M/Sparks #2.  This is a little iffy I know because Melody A.M. came out in late 2002. Sparks #2, which consists of the great singles 'Sparks' and 'Remind Me' from Melody A.M., is all 2003, so I'm counting it. Royksopp is made up of a Norwegian duo who likes their electronica chilled and mellow. They've collaborated with another favorite of mine, Kings of Convenience, who are so mellow it's almost easy listening (easier said than done, of course). Royksopp adds a much-needed jolt of iced-cappuccino to their dreamy voices. It's a great match. If you like Groove Armada or Air, Royksopp should do it for you. It makes decent lovin' music too. Try 'Remind Me,' 'In Space,' or '40 Years Back/Come.'        5. Radiohead- Hail to the Thief.  Perennial Alison favorites Radiohead of course had to make the list, rounding out the top 5. I've loved them for years, but this summer I had the luck of seeing them twice, and both shows were great. Usually Morose, Thom Yorke hurled and jerked himself around the stage like a cat toy, and I like to think the newfound energy is due to his excitement over an album well done. Though not as conventionally accessible as The Bends, Hail to the Thief, comes closer to traditional rock than Kid A and Amnesiac. Each Radiohead album can stand alone as a great work, but collectively, they betray an immensely innovative band that isn't afraid to change their successful sound with each new endeavor, and that takes courage. Hail to the Thief is another Radiohead homerun. I personally love 'Punchup at A Wedding' and 'Scatterbrain.'        4. Postal Service- Give Up.  I loved this album the second I heard it. Ben Gibbard high on Pixie Sticks and finally cheerful while Dntel's Jimmy Tamborello gleefully plays Nintendo in the background. This CD stayed in my car all summer. But fall did come and I realized the lyrics really do sound like they were written by a 14-year-old on a sugar high and a geek with a Casio, and out it came. I still love it, though. It's great because it's novel and it marks a very important time in indie rock. People laughed again and took off their grimy cardigans and realized, to steal the words of the brilliant people at the Hoosier Lottery (don't get me started on how much slogans suck these days), FUN IS GOOD. You're not cool in the first place, so quit trying so damn hard and, as the album title says, give up. Listen to 'The District Sleeps Alone Tonight' and try some Pop Rocks. With Coke.         3. The Notwist- Neon Golden.  Though I just discovered them a few months ago, The Notwist have been around for more than 10 years and have recorded quite a few albums. The band started out as a hardcore punk group, but have since move to more 80's-influenced electronic pop with an indie twist. In a way I can't put my finger on, The Notwist reminds me of New Order and Depeche Mode. The electronic elements are tight and not at all dreamy (it kind of makes sense that they're from Munich) but they're not afraid to innovate with other musical genres. This works especially well in 'Trashing Days,' which begins with simple folk guitar. Other standouts include 'One Step Inside Doesn't Mean You Understand' and 'Consequence.'        2. Wrens- The Meadowlands.  I just received this album about two weeks ago, so I don't know a lot about the Wrens, but, like The Notwist, they have been around for a spell. This is their first album seven years, and it has an incredibly intimate feel. The songs, which convey a feeling of heartbreak and sheer exhaustion, sound so personal it's like they were always there in the American consciousness, waiting to be put down on paper and played. In that sense, they sound completely fresh but familiar at the same time. The music is pretty straightforward alternative rock, but it shifts gears often in a way that isn't disruptive or jolting. This is best listened to as a whole.         1. Broken Social Scene- You Forgot It In People.  Again, another band I saw live before really getting to know. This amazing 11-member outfit comes from Canada and sounds like nothing I've ever heard before yet is a mash-up of all the music I've ever loved. There's even a girl in this band! Experiencing them play was like watching a bunch of people go round and round in a revolving door. Each new song offers a new lead singer and more and more band members wander up to the stage to play some trumpet or trade drums for guitar. The most fascinating thing, though, is the collective of talent that is evident on the album. That these diverse personalities can play and create in such a large dynamic is impressive. They tend to favor slow buildups that end in crashing crescendos involving the whole band mixed with quieter songs that showcase individual skills. It works incredibly well; you need to listen to the whole album to get a real feel for Broken Social Scene.

Today the term is shorthand for the moment when a sitcom, trend or just about anything passes from the "Hot" column into the "Not" side of things. It's such a pervasive term, (some could argue that the term jumping the shark may have just done that) that there's a  urlLink website  that chronicles the climax and inevitable downfall of countless television shows. There's even a mock of it on That 70's Show. I looked through the episode guide, but I couldn't find it. Any suggestions?    What's so extra great about this site is that it has a section titled "A Very Special..." and of course it includes a very special Blossom. Ahh, so many of those episodes were so special it was kind of creepy, but I did love the one where Blossom *ahem* becomes a woman and Clair Huxtable guests as Blossom's mother (how a Jewish girl ended up with a black mom has always confused me, though) and draws female anatomy on a big cake with frosting. Even my mom, Cheryl, couldn't make feminine hygene that touching.  I didn't check  urlLink this site  out because I didn't wanna, but it claims to have shots of Mayim Bialik (I'm giving myself bonus points because I spelled her name right the first time I typed it into Google) topless. You can see Blossom as a REAL woman now, I  guess.

I have a weird obsession with the word and the clothing item: vest. I am not sure why, but they are hilarious. Case in point, if anyone saw Will and Grace last night, a great portion of the show revolved around Will's vest-wearing and the simple use of the word vest. I found it to be priceless, especially since the vest looked to be a velvet paisley kind of garment.   Apparently, if you also love the vest, there are many fashion options for you, with a special bonus for those with pets. Check out this to die for fashion opportunity from this people who want to dress like their dogs web page:   Get a colorful vest!   Jealous of your dog having a better wardrobe than you? Or, do you just like their outfits better and want to match? Love the idea of family pictures! This is the perfect way for you to make that happen... a fleece or fur vest just for you! Stay warm and in style yourself! (Plus, if you want to match your dog as you walk down the street, or have a family picture taken, everyone can be coordinated).    I also have to say that the vest can also suffer from serious persecution. Take for instance, the way "denim vest" was portrayed on Seinfeld. Very unflattering! It takes balls to wear the vest people, ease up! See this weird site of  urlLink Seinclothes , in which apparel plays an integral role in the episode.

      Putnam Goes Ape For Service Animals       Don't be surprised to see monkeys in local supermarkets in Putnam County reaching for things off the shelves and giving them people in wheelchairs. The Putnam Legislature last night went on record supporting a section of the Americans with Disabilities Act, that says service animals must be allowed in all commercial establishments.  Most people are familiar with seeing eye dogs for the blind. But some people in wheelchairs use monkeys, that are trained to fetch things from shelves in stores.  Putnam Legislator Sam Oliverio doesn't know of any disabled person in Putnam having a service monkey. But he wants the county's laws to be ready in case someone goes into a store with a monkey.

If you would call me on the phone, I would have absolutely nothing to say. It's true..I's happened several times already this week. Anyway, I really love learning about shit from the days of yore, and I have spent the past few days trying to find 1890's newspaper advertisements about tea and women's culture for a paper. I came across the coolest source, an online archive of Harper's Weekly, an old society-driven newspaper now turned magazine, with some great stuff.    Also, for anyone that likes to drink tea, I highly recommend black ceylon tea flavored with rose. I purchased some from an international market, and it is my new favorite beverage. My box of tea is from Sri Lanka, and I'm not sure if the rose flavor is done often in American-produced teas. I also learned that putting a cinnamon stick in a cup of tea is a nice alternative to using sugar. Ok, I'll stop being 90 years old now.

         my latest project at work, besides actually working, is to find this photography book on one of my most favorite photographers, francesca woodman.  i have wanted this book for about five years now, never had the money to buy it when i was thinking about it, and have recently been salivating over it online, since it is so rare that most bookstores do not carry it.  what is so frustrating about this is this book is now out of print and it was just released in 1999 or something.  so now the price has gone from $45 new to $300 used and my mission is to find that one bookseller that has not yet received the memo and scam them!  what is so wonderful about this photographer is that her career was so short lived and tragic, but she created a body of work comparable to cindy sherman and nan goldin in about four years.  two articles about her, one in the urlLink  village voice  and another that somewhat compares her to  urlLink sylvia plath  (and shannon perks up!), are worth a read.  maybe i am biased, but i admire how perplexing, yet beautiful her work is and i actually referenced it when creating one of my projects that included self portraiture.    so if you find this book for less that $300, you have made an investment!

This one's for sure the best:  "Each time Nicole Richie dons a long plastic sleeve and inserts her arm up to the shoulder into the birth canal of a farm animal, take three (3) drinks, high five the closest member of your viewing party, and loudly ask, "Who's dancing on the ceiling now, penny lover?"   Sadly enough, I was in class last night and missed the much anticipated premiere episode of The Simple Life. I'm sure all the cool kids are blogging about it, so I had to join in. In case you live under a rock or are in grad school, this is the show where camara crews follow celebutauntes Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie around an Arkansas farm and document the two coltishly trotting around in couture and stilettos and asking townsfolk if Wal-Mart sells walls. You know, between Paris and Jessica Simpson, I feel like a damn rocket scientist.   Already FOX smells a hit, a la Joe Millionaire and is planning on a  urlLink sequel .

       Last night, on a very frosty and windy Tuesday in Boston, Jon and I had dinner in the North End, the coolest part of Boston.  It's the Italian 'hood and a very snazzy place to go.  As soon as you drive in, you smell lots of garlicy goodness...there are probably more Italian restaurants in those 5 or so blocks than there are in all of Italy.  It's off the hizzle fo shizzle.  Anyway I love love love it (even though it was a pretty quiet night and we still had to park far away, pay $9 for it, and freeze our asses off on the walk) and I wish I were heading to Italy SOON.  I need to get myself a piggy bank and start saving up.     On another note, when people tell you the traffic out here sucks, they aren't kidding or exaggerating.  Yesterday was one of the worst traffic days in Boston's history...luckily for me, I drive in the opposite direction of everybody else (west away from Boston instead of east into it) and I didn't have to deal with it.  What would be a 20 minute commute for Jon if there weren't any traffic was 2 1/2 hours yesterday.  Nuts.  Hopefully the Big Dig will be finished in this decade.    And that's the way the cookie crumbles.

I'd have to say it all started a few weeks ago when I won my very first ebay auction. I bid on a 1960's reprint of a French Lolita poster, and I just received it in the mail this weekend. I was so jazzed about the outcome, I did some Christmas shopping yesterday, getting my dad, stepmom and aunt gifts from various online outposts. It was so fun, I got on  urlLink Amazon  to look for a DVD for my roommate. I thought it would be an in and out job, but they tempted me with this whole "spend $12.00 and get free shipping" song and dance. I fell and I fell hard. I should be getting a powder blue velvet minskirt any day now. I also created my very own wishlist and sent it to my mom. What the hell? You want to know the kicker, though?  Since the skirt isn't the same as the DVD, I don't even get the shipping off. I could have taken that damn skirt out of my "cart" but I had so much surfing time invested, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Besides it was on sale.  Not wanting to leave the site, I innocently clicked on this 'Gold Box' shiny icon. Now here's the REAL crack! It's like a game show. You can only buy one item per day and they're supposedly heavily discounted. The site shows them to you one by one, and if you reject the item, it's gone forever. This bullshit had me honestly contemplating purchasing a deep fryer for a turkey for only $98.76 or my own home microbrew system for a mere $166.12. I had to leave, but I kinda want to go back just for the vouyerism. It's like seeing the prize packages on The Price is Right. I know I'll eventually stop lurking and start buying, though. Help.

         Sean and I went to see the movie Monster the other day starring Charlize Theron in her Oscar nominated, Golden Globe winning role.  To say the least, this movie will challenge your view of "cold-hearted killer".  I read a review before I went and the critic said that the movie was named "Monster" to provoke the viewer to decide, after seeing the movie, is the character truely a monster?    A brief synopsis....(This is based on a true story) Charlize Theron plays a serial killer named, Lee, who is abused and molested as a child, has her first child when she is 13, and results to prostitution in Florida as a means of living.  During the nine months between 1989 and 1990 that the film portrays, she then meets Selby, played by Christina Ricci, and they engage in a lesbian relationship.  Without giving too much of the plot away, this is about the only true friend Lee has ever had in her life.  During this time, Lee also has rough encounter with a "client" where she is tied up and raped and ends up killing the bastard.  This starts her killing spree of men that solicit her, leaving 6 men dead by the time she is caught.   She was excecuted in 2002.  Now what is most facinating about this movie is the evolution of Lee.  Not only does Charlize gain 30 pounds and wear contact lens and heaps of makeup (seriously the only times you can see a glimpse of the actress is when she smiles), but she also portrays the inner struggle of her character with passion and ease.    I highly recommend this movie, as does Sean.  Like Mystic River, you just want to die after you leave the theater, but it sparks conversation about social deviance.  I just cannot say enough good things about this flick!

      I had quite an experience at the doctor's office today.  Somehow a simple checkup turned into getting blood tests and a preliminary diagnosis of asthma.  Asthma?  I am a shallow breather but never thought anything of it until Dr. Paterson informed me that she thought I had asthma.  Now I have to get a series of breathing tests called PFTs and a chest X-ray.  All I have to say is, my insurance better cover this; if not, my "asthma" may continue to go untreated.  If it does, great, I'm finally getting something out of my $244.02 monthly insurance payments.  I have felt quite ripped off until my new plethora of illnesses showed up.    Now, the asthma diagnosis I could handle-I don't mind toting an inhaler around-but what really sucked about this particular visit was Dr. P's veiled criticism of my (apparently) bad health habits.  When she asked me if I exercise, I was proud to finally be able to say yes, usually 5 times a week.  Dr. P thinks I should step it up to 6.  I guess I should quit patting myself on the back for taking the initiative to exercise (and mind you, Dr. P is no picture of fitness herself!).  Then she asked me if I smoked, drank, or did drugs; I said I drink only once a week (usually true these days) and fibbed a bit by saying in that one sitting, I'd have 5 or 6 drinks (in reality, maybe 8).  She gave me a disapproving look and said, "That's a lot for a woman."  What would she have thought of me a few years ago?!  She closed our visit by slyly mentioning that I or my boyfriend could have herpes or genital warts and not know it.  Whoa.  The whole time all I could think about was how much I wanted some water, as I had a couple glasses of wine last night and was kind of dehydrated.  I am not quite sure how I gave her the impression that I'm an idiot, especially because now I have some proof that I'm not...I was invited to Berkeley for an interview (wahoo!...that's why I had some wine).        This could be where I spend the next 6 years, Tolman Hall at Berkeley.

The  urlLink website  has lots of great info about his experiment and the documentary he made during it that mcdonalds has refuesed to comment on.  My boss also told me that there was an article about how Ben and Jerrys is just terrible and has more fat in it that a bic mac or what have you.

This program,  Image Union , airs short films, documentaries and other visual media pieces done by local and worldwide filmmakers/artists. Last night I saw  urlLink  Out of the Pit  , a documentary about dogfighting in Chicago. It was really graphic and disturbing, but really brought to light how much dogfighting has influenced our culture beyond the "sport" itself. The producers interviewed every one from police officers to kids about their involvement. Statistically, people who participate in this activity are typically involved in gangs, crime, drugs, and gambling, all which extends outside of the fight itself. Also, a very alarming aspect of all this is the amount of kids, beginning as early as age 5, that are involved. They train the dogs and participate in "light" violence in order to prepare the bulldogs for the actual fighting. This all really weirded me out because I see a lot of kids and young adults in my gang-populated neighborhood with pit bulls, and I never thought that they could be engaged in dog fighting. If you get a chance to watch this, do- but it is very graphic and sad.

But, if you think about it, how many times during a day do we do little or big things that could be considered "cheating?" For instance, is repeating an idea you heard someone else say earlier a form of intellectual cheating? I've been thinking about this because I caught myself using a comment I heard earlier that day in my class. I felt kind of stupid, especially after I realized that I didn't really know what I was talking about!   This  urlLink article  in The Village Voice discusses how common forms of cheating are in our culture, especially now with all the reality tv shows who use the premise of lying for a profit. It brings up the little things, like when the coke machine gives us 2 drinks instead of one. Does that strike anyone anymore as stealing, or do we feel entitled to the free drink since shit is so expensive these days? I usually don't feel bad about things like that, because I think we've come to term things like the bonus drink as "free." What about when the cashier accidentally gives you too much change? And, if they give us too little, don't we freak out? I remember this kid I used to babysit for who would always cheat at Candy Land and other junior board games. It would really piss me off because I think the parents were teaching her that winning, regardless of how it was done, was the way the game was played. I know we're supposed to let little kids win, but should the be allowed to cheat? Should the adults do the cheating for them? Ok, I'll stop with the questions.

      This was too funny to pass up...I was doing some homework on the democratic candidates to educate myself and came across this quote from Al Sharpton.  I think he's got this election in the bag.    "I do believe the [Democratic] party has moved far to the right. I do believe that the party has a bunch of elephants running around in donkey clothes."  Right on, Al.  They're wolves in sheep's clothing.    Here's a trivia tidbit for you: Who was Al Sharpton's wife a back-up singer for?

      So much to blog, so little time :)  I have some pics to post, but am not familiar with computers enough to know where a USB port is off hand, so I must get my "manual for dummies" for using my digital camera.  Seriously, I received this stick that one can save info on and then transfer that info from one computer, ipod, etc to another via the USB port.  I had to ask what it was because I had no idea what I had just unwrapped.  Those of you who are computer savvy, happy laughing!    Anyway, I read this  urlLink article  today on the good old Indy Star website that I find intriguing.  It talks about Gen X and how they work in the workplace (apparently there are books on how to manage Gen Xers.).  It discusses a trend in members of Gen X of simplifying and focusing more on life and happiness than on corporate success.  Now, we are not considered Gen X.  We are grouped in with those Britney worshipping, Prada toting, what are salt and pepper jeans? Gen Ys.  Byron has posted about this internal confusion and displacement before and I enjoyed hearing his argument.  While I never attended prom in taffeta, I still feel that owning a hair crimper, wearing fifty pairs of socks at once, being injured with a slap bracelet, and knowing Johnny Depp prior to Pirates of the Caribbean earns me the right to be in Gen X.  Sure, when I watch "The 80s Strike Back" on VH1, I can only really relate to years 85-89, but who cares?  I want to be part of the "cool" generation!  Also, I saw Chris Rock at the Murat this past Friday and laughed myself silly.  I recommend snagging some seats (if still available) at a venue near you!

      It boggles my mind the way media aimed at children has gone so downhill.  Since I am currently spending most of my time with a 2 year old, I am subjected to listen to this crap.  First, there is way too much of it out there; all kids really need are some pots and pans to bang around and a big empty box (preferably a refreigerator box) to make a fort out of.  Mud and sticks are key too.  Somehow there is this whole crazy toy industry that manages to dupe both parents and kids into spending billions of dollars on plastic melded into various shapes and forms that kids play with for like 10 minutes and then either lose interest or lose all the little pieces that go with the toy, rendering it worthless.  I definitely had some toys growing up that I loved...my Cabbage Patch dolls, my Barbies (all of which I lent to a cousin who then sold them off!  oh well, better to be rid of them I guess), and Legos.  Toys have just been taken to a new level now...who really wants a battery-operated plastic dog that won't stop barking until you put its bone in its mouth, only to have it spit the bone right back out and continue the barking?  Some toys now are straight up creepy, like "Fur Real Friends."      They move around very mechanically, make weird faux-animal noises, and have creepy glassy eyes.    I just can't applaud this stuff.  Perhaps the worst of all is the stuff aimed at kids 3 and under, like Gymboree products.  Grace (who's 2) is watching a Gymboree video right now, and it's pretty appalling.  I think it probably stunts children's growth, but somehow Grace's mom thinks it's the greatest thing ever.  This is what Gymbo the Clown      (a grown man masquerading as a clown...this is the stuffed animal version so imagine a grown man dressed up as such, including face makeup) sings little diddies like "I have a little bicycle, I ride it to and fro, and when I see a green light I know it's time to GO!" while pretending to pedal his legs in a circle.  Another old naptime favorite (which I think would have scared the crap out of me) is this song about being a grizzly bear and growling when you wake up.  What?  Where do they come up with these things?  I wonder if Gymbo the Clown admits to his family what he does.  Does he call up his ladyfriend and tell her he has a slammin' new video out where he acts like various farm animals?  Or does he make up a fake job that no one really gets, like Chandler Bing's job, and never admit his true identity?  I wouldn't.    P.S. For the record, I'm proud to say that Grace has spent more time banging on the pots I set out for her than watching the video.  She's a smart one...ignore that crazy clown!

But frankly, I'm a little frosty at the man. Here's why.   This past Saturday, Matt and I had to attend Pre-Cana, a day-long conference for people wishing to tie the knot in the Catholic Church. Ugg, you say? Yes, I concur. My first beef with Jesus is that this little event costs $165.00. Hm. Vows of poverty, anyone? Now, since the beginning, I have been none too jazzed about anything Catholic Church, but the components of both our families being Catholic, Matt being a fan of going to church, and my mother morphing into a axe wielding monster and killing me for sinning brought us to this point of Pre-Cana. We were warned that it was janky, and boy, were they right!  The day began with Matt and I realizing that I was the youngest person at the conference by a long shot. Turns out that the "Special" group includes sinners that live together, sinners who are divorced, sinners who are divorced with kids, and apparently being over 30 also puts you in the category of special unmarried sinner. I didn't really want to be in the Special group, but I thought we should be honest and not try and be in the "regular" group of engaged virgins. Turns out the whole day our group leader harped upon the fact that co-habitators are sinners finally doing what Jesus wants us to do, so gold star for us. Thank the Lord, we have been saved.   Never in my life have I wanted the "Wrestle Me Jesus" doll more. I wanted to pummel his outstretched, merciful paw-hands that do not have individual fingers. (BTW, I Googled Wrestle Me Jesus and the only entry was from our Blog!) The couple we sat across from literally made out for the majority of the 7 hours this thing lasted. And, we were so glad to know that all the $165.00 really included was a workbook full of questions about whether or not we have talked about having joint checking accounts and what the top five components of a Jesus-loving marriage should be. Our speaker also spiced things up with some jokes about homosexuals and what it means to be "normal" and apparently, we're all on the fringe because we're "Special!" I was sick to my stomach by the end of the day, especially because there were no SNACKS! Thanks, Jesus, way to follow through!   So, Leah, maybe you can chat with Jesus and ask him what's up. He really hurt my feelings and I may not get over it. If he agrees to a wrestling match, I'm so there.  I found some pretty bitchin' action figures, including Moses here. Let's get it on!

Today I was taking the Clark bus to get a haircut. It was snowing and all nasty out, and lately I have been feeling really frumpy and like a horrible dresser in order to stay warm throughout all my adventures in the elements. So, I see this chick on the bus that may have just pranced out of a Jay Z video. Most notable, though, were her shoes. Baby-pink leather 6 inch spike ankle booties with team numbers on the sides. These were STYLIN! I started to think, "Shan, you can be fashionable, too. There's no reason why you can't take off the snowboots (not stuffed in your jeans) and scoot around in hooker boots with an appropriately matching shiny bomber jacket and lace-up-the-side ass exposing jeans! Get with it!" By the time I had reached my stop, I was ready to go shopping at Forever 21, big time. Then, Jay Z's ladyfriend decides to exit the bus as well, only to slip stiletto first into some dirty snow. She was pissed, and I was jazzed to be walking away in my snowboots and ugly bag-lady wear.   I then journeyed to  urlLink Milio's Hair Salon . This place is crazy, because most of the people that work there have fluorescent dreadlocks, multiple piercings, and are in punk bands.  Jared, the guy who cuts me, is super cool and very nice. But, I have a major phobia-- I have always been scared of hair stylists! I have no idea why. I feel very obligated to make small talk, but I never know what to say. Here my fear of being a totally janky person comes through. I get all petrified when he asks me normal questions, like how did I spend the holidays. Instead of saying something normal, I basically digressed about how much I hated the holidays and my family while he looked really uncomfortable. I then apparently tried to rectify things by asking him if all stylists need cosmetology licenses.  Very interesting, indeed. Does anyone else freak out like this for no reason? And advice, or am I the only one who secretly wants to go to cosmetology school?   Seriously, though, Jared and I are pals. I love his hair.   Ok, I'm going to go watch Woody Allen's 1978   urlLink Interiors  . Anybody seen it? Apparently it's the "black sheep" of Allen's stuff. It sounds pretty good. I'll let you know.  ps- the spell checker just wanted to change "frumpy" to "pimp" for some reason. How odd!

I'll put up a quiz today, but then I'll move them to Tuesdays as a standing feature. Feedback is great on something like this so we can see what everyone else's list would be. Also, if you have any suggestions for list topics let me know and I'll put them up (they could potentially be about anything), or if you want a day to do some different running feature, knock yourself out! So here goes the first Friday Five:   Top 5 Music Videos  5. 'Imagine' by John Lennon 4. 'In Bloom' by Nirvana 3. 'Been Caught Stealing' by Jane's Addiction 2. 'Take on Me' by Aha 1. 'Hazard' by Richard Marx haha, just kidding 1. (for real) 'No Surprises' by Radiohead  It was tough; runners up include Movies by Alien Ant Farm (they do great spoofs of classic movies like Willy Wonka and Edward Scissorhands) and 'Hey Ya' by and 'Miss Jackson' by Outkast, but 'Hey Ya' is pretty much a reworking of 'In Bloom.' There are other bands I like a lot more, but I based it soley on cool videos. I'm sure there are great ones I'm forgetting...like anything directed by Paul Hunter or Spike Jonze. Weezer and Bjork videos come to mind.

Since I finally succombed to the registry deal (although i havent hardly registered for anything) I happened onto a personal wedding website on  urlLink theknot.com  of none other than fellow blogger Shannon Coogan!  So, I decided that Shannon is pretty cool and if she has a wedding website then I suppose I can have one too. Mostly I just want to show off John and my work.  I think this is the best  urlLink website  we've ever made together and it took us less time than any of the previous ones too! I guess thats a sign that we're getting closer to become husband and wife in the eyes of Christ.  HA! just kidding kiddies!

      In the craziness that was last and is this week, it has always nice to have the blog.  Actually, as of today, I can slack a wee bit more at work....no more programming!  I just want to thank y'all for the great stories, insights, comment, etc.  Anyway, tissues aside, I must share the glory that is  urlLink Dansko .      One Saturday, my work shoes broke.  Bummer for this server, who has little time to shop this week and needs shoes to work.  Gretchen (my roomie) to the rescue!  She let me borrow a pair of her shoes, the heavenly Dansko clog.  Now I admit I enjoy and seek out infomercials, BUT I do not get sucked in and purchase (Tish does enough QVC shopping for one family).  So when Gretchen raved about the unending pleasures of owning a pair of Danskos, I scoffed at spending so much money for work shoes.  Then I wore them, the soft pillows of shoes that my feet floated in for an entire shift.  I had to spread the word.  These are cute, comfy, non-uggish shoes that are well worth the dough.  Think Doc Marten's Mary Janes, with some cousins.....they also make some yuppie sandals, but no one is perfect.   I purchased the pictured pair, the Kyra shoe, in black.  On a final note, when leaving the store (good old Goodman's in Nora), my salesman suggested a pair of Ugg Boots for my next selection in footwear.  I politely laughed and thought to myself, "I might not be couture, but I am not a yeti!".

It's the best site to find things or just be nosy, but the best part is how they alter their logo in a nod to well-known and more obsure holidays. Today, the Lunar New Year, is no exception. Though I never plan to, I always end up using Google at least once a day. Take a look at this  urlLink archive  of holiday logos.   Just for fun, I Googled all of the proximity girls:  urlLink Leah  Ha! It's the article I wrote about Leah and John meeting.  urlLink Shannon  Aww. This picture was on one of the first sites:    urlLink Katie  Of course it came up with stuff about Jayne Ann Krentz (I think Mike has one of her books). But when we do the  urlLink advanced search , we learn about Katie's time with Slow Children at Play and her high school sports career.  urlLink Jenny  I see you've received free stuff from a guy named Rob Lamont and attended the Boulder City Ballet.  urlLink Jennie  Hmm. There are a lot of you here, but I hope you're not the one born in 1859. Damn girl, you old! Nice work volunteering for the Julian Center, though finally,  urlLink Me  My name's so generic, I get to be a member of the Scottish Hockey Union and a tropical disease consultant. Sweet.

I don't know if it's the latest trend everywhere, but in the place where winter boots are least needed, Uggs are all the rage.  As soon as I say that, I'm sure they'll be deemed uncool, undeck even. ;)  I've seen them worn mainly with a short skirt, chubby legs, fake tan, and a gut.  Believe it or not, L.A. reminds me a lot of IU ; lots of large, spoiled, Fendi toting girls gabbing on their cell with one hand while shittily maneuvering out of their illegal parking spot right in front of the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  Who has the time to park, let alone find a metered street parking spot.  Besides, Daddy still pays for all of my parking tickets.  Ugg.  Wow.  I'm in a saucy mood today.  Maybe it's due to the pigeons that roam freely in this food court, nipping at my exposed toes under my stool.  I've never seen so many angry lunchgoers swatting and kicking the hell out of the little critters.  This table of women eating their taquitos let out the hugest yelps and belted the little pidgie in mid-air.  No, she didn't wash her hands after that.  Nequa didn't want her taquitos to get cold.  Have you seen Subway's attempt to become Atkins friendly?  They have a bacon cheddar mayo goo wrap and some other condiment/meat/cheese ridden wrap.  They look horrid.  They should call it the heart attack combo meal.  I'm still leery of the whole Atkins fad, and I think exercise, avoiding caffeine, drinking lots of water, and eating balanced meals is the way to go.  I'm not quite sure of the Wolfgang Puck Express that I'm sitting in front of.  Seems to me that the food was overhyped and overpriced to begin with, but now add the word "express" to it, and it's the most expensive, bland, slowest fast food with a lot of attitude behind the cash register.  The tourists still come in droves, after all, it IS Wolfgang Puck.  A guy just wiped out while trying to stand on the first step of a descending escalator.  He was too enamored with his reflection in the porn mirrors that surround the area.  It's amazing how many people check themselves out upon stepping off the escalator up here, and it's not always the casual glance either.  So far we're averaging about 7 out of 10 random folks giving a deep stare at themselves.  I admit to doing the "look" at clothing stores.  Put a mirror anywhere, and I think people subconsciously saunter over for a peek at how they're looking.  I can't finish my sandwich.  I think I'll give the rest to the pigeon who's currently trying to make meal out of my toenails.

      I think enough time has passed now that I can write about how much the Colts sucked it up on Sunday without pouring salt on open wounds...or maybe I'm just reopening them.  What have you, I don't think any of the C.P. gals are too into football so I'll take the risk.  At any rate, I watched the game with Patriots fans (at this guy called Fat Boy's house), and they realized pretty quickly that I was not one of them.  I should have kept my mouth shut because I got a lot of shit during that game.  I haven't been a Peyton Manning fan ever since Jon informed me that he was accused of sexual harrassment during college, and after that game...hmm.  The expressions on his face were almost comical..."Did I, PEYTON, just throw that?!  What the f**K?!"       I got some skis in New Zealand last year and finally broke them in on Monday at this place in New Hampshire called Tenney Mountain; it was pretty cold and windy, but they had some great runs.  They ain't got nothin' on Swiss Valley, Michigan.  ;)  It was a great time, and I only fell once (although I had several close calls).  I sort of gimped my way down a couple black diamonds, but hey, at least I gave it a shot.  That about sums up my ghetto-fabulous weekend, and now it's back to work.  ooooooooooh yeah.

It was a great few days despite the bitter, bitter cold we encountered on Sunday. On Saturday, we checked out the Manet and the Sea exhibit at the Art Institute. Some interesting stuff, but I have to say my favorite part was the Chagall stained-glass window in the hallway right before the gallery (See Ferris Bueller's Day Off if you can't get there). It's beautiful.   On Sunday, we went out to Hyde Park to see the Frank Lloyd Wright Robie house. It was very cool, and we were in a small tour group, which was nice, but unfortunately we couldn't see the upstairs with all the bedrooms because of fire codes. Imagine watching MTV's Cribs and not getting to see "where the magic happens." Worth a look if you're interested in architecture, though. It's also a good way to donate to the cause because that house needed some renovations.  Saturday night, however, was a blast. We went to a place called Schuba's to see  urlLink The Wrens  (#2 on my Best Albums of 2003 post). It was a great, albeit too short, set, but they were playing two sold-out shows that night. I got to chat with them after their first show for a bit, which was great because I'm writing a freelance feature of the band. They were really nice guys and even let me take a few pictures:   This was the first show of their tour. If they're  urlLink coming to a city near you , definitely check them out. Shan and Katie, they will be in LA and Chicago, so you have no excuse.  The next day, we saw the band at brunch. What are the odds? It kind of made me feel like a stalker, though. Anyway, just about everyone we ran into in Chicago was incredibly nice this trip. From the guy at the Art Institute who was hellbent on getting us to eat dinner at Bennigan's to the friendly-yet nonsensical guy on the el to Mark, the lawyer who just had a baby, who chatted with us at the bar, everyone was really talkative and fun. Way to be Chicago!

Let's start out with this  urlLink quiz , which is kind of lame because it gives the answers right after the questions. The scoring determines whether or not "you are exactly the kind of ignorant citizen your government desires." Apparently, after you read all the info on this site, you know the "truth." Very encouraging and efficient that one can find it all at one site. Props to them. Another interesting link is the page that chronologically examines King's  urlLink plagiarism  in his speech-writing. I know that he was far from the perfect leader that he was made out to be throughout history, but I do really admire him for doing something that not many people have the courage to do. King stood up for a cause and a people he believed in, despite the constant threat of the American government, death, and violence. The values he preached- to first allow ourselves, not others, to decide who we are, and to then peacefully challenge those who try to take away that right-- are eternally relevant and powerful. Today, I hope that we continue to make strides in understanding King so we can respect him as a "normal" person -with faults- who had a lot of courage to go up against the notoriously idiotic American ideology.

The one to your left is by no means the worst, but it at least makes me smile because if I were forced to wear it, I could at least reuse it at my audition for a spot on the Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom entertainment team. USA! Anyway, a big thanks goes out to Shan for choosing pretty bridesmaid dresses, devoid of stars n' stripes. A 21-gun salute to you!   Another great shot to check out is  urlLink this one  because the author is sure the kid at the right is the boy from Oliver Beene, Katie's TV show. On another note, I watched the Royal Tenenbaums again this weekend and was shocked that I didn't know  urlLink Grant Rosenmeyer  (aka Oliver Beene) plays Ari Tenenbaum. I see also that the next character he's slated to play is one named 'Mordechai'....kind of like the hawk in the Royal Tenenbaums. Crazy

Why would I? I'm from Indiana for Christ's sake. And, no matter how kitschy, I don't think I'll ever be down to clown with mustaches. I also happen to think 'Trippendicular' is a way better word for cool than the hipster-approved 'Deck.' In fact, that word will be absorbed into my lame-ass vernacular post haste. Sorry you're about to be in the car with me for four hours, Mike! Anyway, find out if  urlLink  you're a hipster .   Just a little background for all y'all (I KNOW hipsters don't say that): A hipster is   " One who possesses tastes, social attitudes, and opinions deemed cool by the cool. (Note: it is no longer recommended that one use the term "cool"; a Hipster would instead say "deck.") The Hipster walks among the masses in daily life but is not a part of them and shuns or reduces to kitsch anything held dear by the mainstream. A Hipster ideally possesses no more than 2% body fat."   Check out  urlLink The Hipster Handbook  for all things deck. Er, I mean trippendicular.

      I have now lived in Boston for approximately 4 1/2 months.  And lucky me...I get to be here to experience the coldest day Massachusetts has seen since 1957.  That's right...me, who hates cold weather, gets to be here for one of the coldest days in history (here are the stats: -10 F without wind chill; in some places, up to -50 F with wind chill).  Nearly every school has cancelled school (from an article in the Boston Globe: "I can't remember ever closing school for the temperature," said Frederick Foresteire, Everett school superintendent, who has worked in the city's school system for 38 years. "It is out of the ordinary.").  In these temperatures, you can get frostbite after just a few minutes of exposure to the cold.  I just don't understand why people are willing to live in such a climate.  Take a tip from our fine feathered friends: migrate south!  Old people do it, due to their long years of experiencing how much cold weather sucks.  I personally will be migrating south or west come July...I just can't believe it's taken me this long.

Anyway, I'm really thrilled to be  urlLink The Adventures of Pete and Pete . I mean, what other show gives the 11-year old main character a tattoo of a foxy lady named Petunia and has guest cameos by people like Iggy Pop? Some of the bands featured on the show are pretty cool too: The Apples in Stereo, Lucious Jackson and Magnetic Fields to name a few.  So what are you?

As we were walking near the street I spotted this card on the wet ground and quickley put it in my pocket.  I LOVE found stuff.  Check  urlLink Found Magazine  which I believe katie linked to during the early days of the blog.   So, the inside of the card reads:  Dear Jonathan-  I just wanted to thank you for a great weekend.  I had a lot of fun with you.  I miss you so much.  I felt so close to you over the weekend, it was so hard leaving you.  You were so good to me this weekend, you always take good care of me.  What would I do without you?  I love you, cutie!  You are the cutest bear I've ever known.  I can't wait to see you again.  Believe me, the next weekend we spend together will be even better than the one we just had.  (If you know what I mean!)  Happy Valentine's Day, Sweetheart!  I love you!   PS- I love my gift from Victoria's Secret and thank you for dinner.  I love you and I miss you very much!    The funny thing is, I found this card a few days before new years 2004, so this card is almost a year old since I refers to a valentine's day they just spent.  So, how did it come to be laying on the wet ground in front of old newgate prison almost a year later??  Lets let our minds run wild...I want elaborate stories here!!

Here is the synopsis: "On April 12, 2002, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez—new icon of the left and a thorn in the side of the U.S. Administration—was removed from office and replaced by a new interim government. What had in fact taken place was the first Latin American coup of the 21st century. Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley & Donnacha O’Briain chart the last seven months of the charismatic leader’s administration up to the coup, capturing extraordinary footage inside the Presidential Palace both during the coup and the 48 hours of the short-lived interim government. A remarkable documentary of media manipulation and distortion"  My review will follow on Saturday!  Have a good friday everyone.

The experiment was conducted by the U.S government and the artist's subject is the doctor that injected the drug. The drawing on the left  is before the acid kicked in, and the one on the right represents the artist's vision well into his trip. You can see a  urlLink progession  in his drawings from conventional to more and more abstract. All are different, but I'd have to say each one has its own artistic merit.  An interesting look for sure. (Via  urlLink The Morning News )

         Now that my grad school applications are in (yip, yip, oooooooh yeah), I have found a new activity to fill my afternoons while Grace naps.  While snooping around the Rousseau household, I happened upon some Kathy Smith workout DVDs that Susan does (she's my boss, the family's mama-and I must say, I applaud her for staying in such great shape after popping out fo' chillins).  So I decided to venture into the world of working out, not only for my health but also for the great quotes ("and lift it, and stretch it, and pump it, and pulse it, you're doing FANTASTIC" *if I ever made a workout tape, I'd substitute snacktastic*).  At any rate, Kathy Smith is full of enthusiasm for fitness and at first, I found myself wanting to thank her for her encouraging words.  But after doing "Timesaver: Lift Weights to Lost Weight" a few times, I find them to be ridiculous.  For all Kathy knows, I am sitting on the couch with a bag of Doritos, laughing at her antics and comments (to a big black guy who's part of her weight-lifting crew: "How come your bicep's bigger than mine?"..."Pump it!").  So far, my efforts have left me with a sore back and shoulders but no muscles; I may have to turn to steroids for the hardcore woman weightlifter's body I've always coveted.  Bottom line, kickin' it with Kathy is an okay way to pass some time in the afternoon; now, next time I see any of you, I'll expect comments on my scuplted arms and calves.  Thank you, thank you.

      Howdy folks.  My apologies for being delinquent in my blogging for awhile now.  With my show going on hiatus and me being unemployed to going home to just now getting a laptop and hooked up to the Internet, it's been a crazy few months.  So I'm back with little to report, except that I'm knee deep in temporary Job Search 2004, until I find out if/when our show got picked up for Season Three.  I thought I'd keep you up to speed with my interview progress (if there is any), and just how hard it is to get a shitty job in L.A. even with a college degree!   For those of you who haven't checked it out,  urlLink Craigslist  has proven to be a great resource when searching for a job in a big city.  Just click on your city on the menu, and you'll be privy to tons of apartments for rent, jobs for grabs, and my personal fave, the barter section.  Man, if I only had my degree in "massage therapy."    I've sent, faxed, and emailed out about 50 resumes to various businesses, and I've gotten three calls.  That seems to be the trend when doing these mass mailings.  It's extra hard to get a waitressing position as you have to submit a headshot along with your resume just to be considered (yes, it's an audition), and usually 1,000 women audition for the coveted one waitressing position.  So you tell me, is a funny, quirky, unconventionally cute brunette gonna get the position over nose and jug-job Jill?  Apparently boobs sell booze out here.  I interviewed for the position of hostess at a place that holds kids' parties for stinking rich families in Santa Monica.  Upon entering the facility, I was told to take off my shoes and grab a mat and join the circle.  I kid you not!  So basically, I'd be helping frazzled underworked mothers set up their one year old's birthday party with thirty of the one year old's closest friends!  Apparently the tips are great.  They liked me, and said they'd call me to set up a trial runthrough of a typical party day for this weekend.  They still haven't called.  It's not like I even want the job that badly, but out here, even if they say you have the job, it doesn't mean you have the job.    I'm *holding my thumb and index finger an inch from each other* this close to doing some weird performance act for spare change at the Santa Monica Pier.  Any suggestions as to what my talent should be?    &emailalert=no&email=adgrant@indiana.edu&url=http://closeproximity.blogspot.com&name=Proximity&bgcolor=003399&fcolor=FFFFFF&link=FFFFCC&words=comments&title=Comments &width=350&height=350">

He's really a nice cat, but looks extra evil this year. I think he was a little pissed that my camera's flash woke him from a nice nap in the wrapping paper. Since quite a few people have been complaining because I never take my pictures off my camera, here are all the pre-Christmas through New Year's Eve photos I have.  If I saw you, they're in here. These are a few near and dear:    We couldn't all seem to look at the camera at once.     Shockin' Y'all at the Monkey's Tail.

Monday marked my first day back at Loyola. Fun, not so fun, just depends on my mood. I am taking a feminist theory course, which promises to be interesting, because I am not a die hard feminist, and I've never taken a class totally devoted to the subject before. To prepare for the first day, the instructor asked us to read  urlLink Carolyn Heilbrun's   urlLink  Writing a Woman's Life , which was originally published in the late 80's. It's a really interesting look at how and why we as women write the way we do. Me not being a consistent, serious writer outside of school, I didn't think that this book would have much to say to me. However, it reaches far into the way women think about their personal lives, relationships with men and other women, and how their portrayals of themselves have changed over the years. I highly recommend the book; it's a short and very engaging text. There are some times when I find Heilbrun a little too much herself (a major pioneer in feminist theory) and exclusionary to men. But, makes you think all the same. She was a product of the notoriously traditional Wellesley, so to me, that makes her feminist standpoint all the more interesting.      I am going to a tribute to Heilbrun next week, because she rather abruptly ended her own life before the new year. Apparently, her strange life and death philosophy centered on the fact that once one has made a significant contribution to humanity, she can end her own life. Creepy! She is also the author of a detective novel series, which was first published in the mid 60's. They are under the pseudonym of Amanda Cross and although I have not read one, her reasons and small descriptions of her fiction writing career sound fascinating.

It was a very misty, dreary day, but driving along the winding country roads was in a way beautiful. Everything was wrapped in fog and even the most mundane sights (ie: falling-down trailers) looked mysterious in their own way. I've always been fascinated by junkyards, so I took these pictures on my way back.

The protagonist of this book is Bukowski's alter ego Henry Chinaski.  His character is completely repulsive in almost every way and yet I couldn't put the book down.  The idea of sex became mildly disgusting after reading a chapter and when I finished reading the last word of the book on christmas eve I closed the paperback and kind of shuddered.  And yet, I find myself ready to read another of his books, perhaps the more famous "Post Office" or "Ham on Rye."  Part of the attraction is his really simplistic style of storytelling.  It's really quite exquisite.  No extra bullshit whatsoever.   But the other phenomenon is the old train-wreck syndrome.  Where something is rather horrific, but yet you can't look away; or if you do, you're continually stealing glances between the fingers covering your eyes.  I'm not really sure why the train wreck phenonmenon occurs.  What do you think?

        Okay, so New Year's Eve, abbreviated is NYE, my last name.  You'd think that I'd be destined to rock New Year's for that simple reason, but the stars were not given that memo and year after year, I wait to see what might occur.  Now this seems to be a common complaint; "yeah, New Year's is my least favorite holiday; it always sucks" or "it's overrated".  Well, I feel like it's my RIGHT to have a good New Year's since it spells my name, much like the Irish MUST party on Patty's Day.  Last year, I managed a quick get away by leaving the country and time zone and am proud to say that January first never happened for me (thanks for that International Date Line!).  But let me tell you about this year......  I worked....at Sullivan's.  I was there at 2 blowing up balloons and was greeting my first table around 4:30.  Two lesbians who wanted nothing to do with my perky ass and were only there b/c they had a gift certificate that expired on January 1, 2004.  They were on a date and set up camp at my table for two hours.  UGH!  We were running a package that started around 5:30.  $75 a person and that included appetizer, salad, entree, side, dessert.  Later in the evening, I get double sat (two tables at once) with a NINE TOP and an EIGHT TOP!!  Craziness ensued.  Each person at the table of eight is wearing enough diamonds/couture to buy all of our houses and living spaces.  They order a bottle of Cristal, the ONLY bottle in the house. This costs about $380.  But at this point, he could have ordered a bottle of house wine and I would have reacted the same, BUSY!     Anyway, turns out this cat is none other than Kenny Anderson, famed point guard for the Pacers.  I had no clue.  Turns out he is also on the injured list.....mmmhmmm.  So that's work.  Made some money, out by 1:00, ready for a beer.  I attend this house party with Sean, despite just wanting to chill.  Drunk people at 1:00am + Me after work= Annoyed.  Small party, not so bad.  I actually went to grade school with the house owner and his girlfriend is one of my reading coaches at the Julian Center.  I am there for about 45 mins when chaos ensues.  Sean's friend, Tommy, falls over on another friend, Dave, and splits his head open on the door frame.  I, along with Emily and Preston (the only other sober folks) get to drive his drunk, barfing, bleeding ass to the hospital for stiches.  It's 4:00am before he emerges with 10 staples in his head.  I was alone in the waiting room, almost asleep and cursing New Year's.   So that was New Year's Eve 2003.  Anyone want to hang out next year?

I was in Indianapolis, and nothing happened to me whilst I was there, so I had nothing to post about! New Year's was really fun, but Aly has the digital pics...  Anyway, my reason for writing: Matt and I are now back in Chicago, thank goodness, and we decided to be all adult and get up early and go to church. We have been super delinquent about that considering that we are required to go in order to do this whole wedding thing. So, we go, we sit, we enjoy not being out in the blizzard that is upon us. And, 2 late-comers pass walk up by is to get in a pew. The man was holding a cup of Starbucks! Now, I'm no religious fanatic, but I think there are a few places that one should not bring their favorite status-defining beverage. He just sat there and sipped his drink like he was at the movies (which it still annoys be that you can get Starbucks at the theaters) or just hanging out. Didn't even put it down for all the many stand-sit-kneel routines of the Catholic church. I started envisioning a little Starbucks window in the back of the church so one could just pick up something to drink on the way in.   I don't like Starbucks for the simple reason that I think their coffee tastes like shit. I don't really even drink coffee, but whenever I end up in a store (usually at the mercy of someone else) I always order something hoping that it won't be nasty sugary vomity, and it always is! I guess the point of this rant is that Starbucks is the ever -present ultimate consumer culture product, and I'm super sick of this, especially when the stores drive out independently owned businesses in my neighborhood. There is a funny site for those who hate  urlLink Starbucks  which is a little overboard in my opinion. I don't have a to-the-death hatred, just a musing dislike. Anywho, here is a pic of me tooling about, smiling like a gremlin on xmas vacation. This was just after I cracked Matt's mom's car windshield, and she was nice enough to buy me a generic cup of cocoa. (She drank Starbucks). Aw! This peacock was growling and making weird clicky noises at me!

I was a litte on edge, because I brought Matt (who has about a 1 hour limit on "chick" issues) and a super Christian friend, but all went really well. I just didn't really know what the Monologues were all about, but the message and the cause, preventing violence against women, were really powerful. All the proceeds of the event went to Rape Victim's Advocates of Chicago, and wherever the Monologues are performed, the proceeds automatically go to a women's charity of some sort. It was interesting, however, because I found that no matter how "modern" and "in touch" with yourself you feel, the v-word still makes for some uncomfortable feelings and taboo subjects. Has anyone else attended a performance? Thoughts?

I've been perpetually frustrated and frightened with our current administration, and the fact that Dubya now wants to amend the Constitution to ban gay marriages and pander to the religous right, I'm about at the end of my rope. And hearing about how the economy might rebound and ensure Bush has an easy road to reelection next November paints a pretty bleak picture for me. Instead of getting all soapboxy on you, I encourage all readers to take  urlLink this quiz  to see just what our commander-in-cheif without a clue has been up to these days. Here's a hint: it's more pathetic than you think.  For good measure, be sure to take a look at all the wonderful "sanctity" in  straight marriages  these days. Good old Craigslist.

       Okay, so one of my life dreams is to be a backup singer.  I mean, come on, they get to wear the snazzy costumes and chime in with some "ooo"s and "ahhh"s to complement the lead singer, plus there is the added microphone dance that must be perfected (and we all know how well I can cut a rug!).  Some of the artists that I would most like to backup sing with are Elton John (he practically writes his songs for the backup singer!), Billy Joel, and Paul Simon.  Oldies but goodies....if only I could carry a tune.  So, going along with the proposals of late, I propose this:  what ditty would you be belting if appearing on Star Search, American Idol, the Miss/Mr./Mrs. American pagent, or the Grammys?  I would have to go with "Ray of Light" by Madonna.  Despite my current irritation with her shenanigans and fake British accent, that song never fails to put me in a dancing mood.    Check out this site to test your knowledge of  urlLink backup singers .

       Jon and I eat the same basic meals every week: tacos (my personal favorite), ravioli, salad and bread, frozen pizza, pasta...or we go out.  So I'm wondering what everybody else eats that is quick and easy...especially Jennie and Leah, since I know there won't be meat in your suggestions.  Not to get all Martha on you gals, but I could use some meal ideas.  I have a righteous bean dip recipe that's sure to snackisfy if anyone's interested.

Friday night was cool. Mike and I just stayed in and watched Amelie; very relaxing. Then Sat night, Janel and I had some people over for a Hawaiian luau because the weather sucks right now. I was jazzed because we bought some fly decorations from Hobby Lobby (such as a fisherman's net and assorted shells...It was SO Long John Silver's) and Teddy and his lady Jean and Byron and his lady Brie came down for the festivities. You can see a few pictures  urlLink here . All in all, a good time with leis and hot jamz like La Isla Bonita and the like.   Anyway, as you may notice in the picture above and this one,  , my car has a flat tire. Sunday morning, Mike and I were all psyched to meet Byron and Brie at the Cracker Barrell (yeah!) for some brunch when we went out to my car to find I had not one, not two, but THREE flat tires! How much does that suck? It turns out they were punctured with something like an ice pick or screwdriver and I had to replace two of the tires and get the other one patched. This was like a $200 prank. I'm not sure who would do this, but Janel (the roommate) and I have has some issues with the loud girls that live upstairs (basically they're annoying hoes that like to come home at 2 am on Tuesday nights and stomp around in stiletto boots and listen to "Hey Ya" on repeat. Oh, and one of them likes to have sex to Yanni) Yeah, so they were a little frosty at Sat. night's loudness, which is bullshit because we invited them down and ITS A SATURDAY at 11 PM, not Tuesday at 5 or whatever. I hate to think they did it, but whoever did is so not cool at all.

          This past Friday, my mom, Tish, and I went to see the traveling Broadway musical, The Lion King.  We actually got to attend a pre-screening of the show courtesy of United Way, so I felt important.  Anyway, I must say that all of the hype was well worth it.  I did enjoy the original cartoon flick, but this blew me away.  The story line is the same, but they have added a couple new songs for the production.  In my opinion (and the Tonys agree as well), the costumes are what make this production so spectacular.  They create a giraffe from a person balancing all fours on stilts and them wearing a long giraffe neck and head.  These creatures come on stage teetering and anbling around, much like a real giraffe.  The opening number (the good old "Circle of Life") brings all the animals of the sahara out to celebrate Simba's brith, including an elephant, a cheetah, gazelles, soaring birds, and zebra.  Just fantastic.    I must also comment on the music, since it is a musical.  It is rich with African influence and Rafiki, the crazy monkey, takes on the role of almost an ancient African healer.  Not that he wasn't in the movie, but it is exaggerated in the live show.  But the new songs, the scenery, the costumes all keep it real with the African theme.  Loved it!  Just in case I've piqued your interest, the show will remain in Indy until the end of March and then goes to Columbus, San Fran, Boston, and Detroit (not in that order), and is always playing up in NYC.

       I am not generally a fan of skunks, nor do I know anyone who is.  But, they do have a one-up on just about every other species because when they die (well, at least when they die as roadkill), they get the last laugh.  They make a stink, if you will.  You may not notice every animal that's a victim of careless drivers, but skunks make you notice their fate with that last blast.  There's a dead skunk on my drive to work that has been stinking up Route 9 for the past couple days and shows no sign of letting up.  I just like the idea of the skunk getting to give a big 'fuck you' to whomever built a highway in thier hood that ultimately led to their death.  Also, I hope that whoever nailed the skunk feels guilty every time they drive by-there's no forgetting what went down with that stench.  Maybe it will help people pay a little more attention to the critters in the road (not to dog anyone who has unwittingly hit an animal-say, a goose-I know sometimes it's unavoidable).

Guess what, they are all bad.  Bird flu causes Europe to boycott our poultry  (eeeew!) Bush proposes amemdment against gay marriage (fucking bastard!)  an NPR series on heroin and how more and more young people are choosing to use it  (tear*)   So, after much consideration I've decided to post about what makeup ive been wearing lately.  Lighten the mood!   On my eyes:   urlLink  MAC Paint in Mauvism   (dont you just love the stupid names they pick for colors of makeup?)  This stuff is great.  It comes out of a tube and I put it on with my fingers.  It stays on really well and I use it as a base for my other eyeshadow so that will stick.  urlLink   Sonia Kasuk Purple eyeshadow   from target: This is a huge compact of eyeshadow but I only use the dark purple.  mostly in the crease of my eye.  Im way into the eighties look of colored eyeshadow lately.  Im not sure how soon I'll get over it.  If ever!  On my cheeks:   urlLink  Neutragena Shimmer:    I have this stuff in a whiteish shade that I put on my cheekbones and it makes them look luminescent.  I don't use blush.  On my lips:   urlLink  Kiehl's SPF 15 lip balm  .  Sooooooooooo awesome.  I get it in the red color.  Its really sheer, glossy and not at all sticky.  And it has SPF so i won't get lip cancer (except from dippin' yall)  Concealer:   urlLink  Laura Mercier Secret Camoflage  :  This is also awesome.  It has great coverage for my little red spots.    Powder:  Just a  urlLink  Mac sheer pressed powder  :  Really light and makes my skin lots softer  I also wear an Almay black waterproof mascara that I've worn since high school.  It's exciting to try new makeup.  I used Clinique all through high school and college  pretty much and then recently migrated to MAC mostly.  My sis also wore Clinique but has since migrated to Bobbi Brown.  Although for certain things you absolutely cant beat the drug store makeups.    What are you guys using?  Any major switchs in product use lately?  Im open to discussing hair care as well.  Cheers!

I just can't understand how self righteous Nader must be to attempt to repeat his contribution to the debacle that was the 2000 election.  He says that by running he is making a statement about the need for change in the political process in America and that the two-party system is bullshit and the candidates are backed by special interests.  yadda yadda yadda.  Im not going to disagree with any of that because its all true.  BUT I'd just like to say:   Nader my friend, take a fucking look around you.  Our country is in complete shambles.  I have not seen the political and cultural climate of our country change so quickly for the worse as it has in the last four years with Satan and Friends in office.  We have real problems in this country.  Like a loss of free speech for one.  I really don't think that we can afford to be making statements about the two party system being crappy until we get some other things worked out first.  Like that thing about everyone else in the world hating our guts.

       On my drive to work this afternoon, I stopped at Panera to grab some grub and then headed off to the Julian Center.  I took Michigan Road which brings me past a Lowe's hardware store.  Outside of Lowe's was this gentleman dressed as Uncle Sam and clutching a fistfull of cash.  I looked around for some promotion or something to allude to why this man is dressed like this in the rain in front of a hardware store and realized that he was panhandling!     This reminded me of a recent Simpson's episode where Homer falls into panhandling after a drunken night and realizes that he too can panhandle and then buy Marge the diamond jewelry she has always wanted.    Since Sean is currently between jobs, I suggested he dress up as a Leprechan or something and give Uncle Sam a run for his money!

This week I'm going with my top five favorite movie quotes. These may not be my favorite movies (but I like them all), but these quotes never fail to crack me up.   Top 5 Movie Quotes  5. "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K." Keanu from  Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure  4. "Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion" some mom from  Donnie Darko  3. "Three thousand years of beautiful tradition from Moses to Sandy Kofax, your damn right I'm living in the past!" Walter to the Dude in  The Big Lebowski  2. "Don't Fuck with me, fellas. This isn't my first time at the rodeo." Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford (see picture) in  Mommie Dearest  1. "You're in love with Richie. Which is sick. And gross." Owen Wilson as Eli Cash in  The Royal Tenebaums  about Margot's love for her brother Richie.  Ahhh goodtimes. These quote crack me up even more, but I cut them out of the running because they're really diologue:  Detective : I'm a Brother Seamus.  the Dude : What's that? Like an Irish Monk? (from  The Big Lebowski )  This one's between Gene Hackman and Danny Glover in  The Royal Tenenbaums :  Royal : Are you trying to steal my woman?  Henry Sherman : I beg your pardon.  Royal : You heard me, Coltrane.  Henry Sherman : "Coltrane"?  Royal : What?  Henry Sherman : Did you just call me Coltrane?  Royal : No.  Henry Sherman : You didn't?  Royal : No.  Henry Sherman : Okay...  Damn, that shit has me laughing out loud every time. What about you guys? What gets to you in movies?

       I have seen "The Apprentice" a few times now, and I find it really irritating that Donald Trump is now being referred to as "The Donald."  No kidding.  How about "The Hairpiece" or "The Toupee?"  Much more suitable if you ask me.  Perhaps worse is how "The Donald" views his lifestyle; it bothers me that he assumes he has what everyone else wants.  Not at all, Hairpiece.  If I ever turned into a person remotely similar to who he is, I'd want one of you guys to hunt me down and kick my ass.  Along the same lines is this new Range Rover commercial I just saw.  It shows these two guys walking alongside a road in the snow in France, backpackin' it.  One guy is telling the other that he wants to major in ceramics.  Then this Range Rover pulls over and gives them a lift, and they get in the car and start drooling all over  themselves at how cool it is.  They look at each other and one tells the other, "Maybe you could minor in ceramics."  And major in something that will enable you to make enough money to buy a fine piece of machinery like this.  I hate that kind of crap and all the assumptions that go along with it; as though everyone who isn't living that type of lifestyle desparately wishes that they were.  Ridiculous.  The happiest person I know is my sister, who works as a therapeutic horseback riding instructor at a non-for-profit organization and makes maybe $25,000 a year.  As far as I'm concerned, Donald can take his hairpiece and Range Rover and shove it.

They say Blasthaus is where art and technology converge, which is always appealing to me (and I'll bet John too, Leah), and at www.rxgallery.com they're announcing their current exhibition "BOLT: A Low Tech Odyssey".    Here's what RX Gallery has to say about BOLT:  Retro-tech collective bolt (bureau of low technology), who coined the word "technostalgia", is at it again with this revivalist effort to ressusitate the obsolete and otherwise "dead media" of video games in its latest art experience "A Low-Tech Odyssey".   How fun would it be to go to a gallery, drink some wine, and play old games for free on Intellivision and Atari game consoles.  I still can't get enough of Pac-Man on Atari, or Baseball on Intellivision.  Am I the only child of the 80's who still longs for a little 8 bit graphics of fun?  Hopefully Jenny can soon be our San Fran Proximity correspondent, and give us the low down on this hip wine bar/gallery.  Speaking of low technology, are those who try to post on Macs (which I'm doing) having less capabilities than those on PC's?

I'll post mine and then you all post yours in the comments.  Its just three songs...not too taxing.  1.  Pink Moon by Nick Drake 2.  The Other Side by David Gray (i would never have listened to this on my own but it would always come on at the agency and its really kind of a beautiful if really simple song) 3.Black Acres by Elysian Fields  All these songs are reflective of the snow we've been having i think now that i look back at them.  I like melancholy with my snow i guess.

They even wrote (get read for this) BABY GOT BACK ...when they were in like high school or something.  (Remember how katie would always laugh at how i sang the first phrase of that song????)   Here is an  urlLink article  from the most recent Paper mag about him. Im not sure if you've all heard their CD from a few years ago (their only CD to date) as NERD called "In search of.." It is perennially one of my favorite CDs (did i use that word wrong?).  Probably one of the best hip hop albums of ALL time.  I say that with total confidence, and am prepared to defend it.

The CU football program was accused of using sex to recruit players and there have been I think 4 allegations of rape by CU football players in the last 3 years.  Everyday a new police report from 2001 or so comes out to add to the list of disgustingness.  But the kicker (pardon the pun) was a few days ago when Katie Hnida, the only female player ever on CU's team came forward to say that she had been raped by a teammate and continually molested and harrassed by the others leading to total mental breakdown.  She left the team, left CU and went into a period of darkness she said.  She now goes to University of New Mexico where she plays on their football team and says that she has never had any problem whatsoever with harassment.  So that proves that its CU's football team that is the exception to the rule i hope.  Last night the coach (Barnett) made this statement about how the players respect people if they are good atheletes and how Katie was an "awful" player.  Hmm, yep, she DOES deserve to get raped if she's awful right Barnett.  Here is the urlLink  article  on CNN to hear the whole story about the other allegations of rape by CU football players.  Makes me want to march up there and kick him square in the balls.

      Welp, I'm back from the big interview.  Whew!  Crazy times, ladies, crazy times.  We stayed in a seedy little hotel called the Berkeley Travelodge-good thing Jon was with me or it may not have been a safe option.  The weather wasn't the best-pretty rainy- but that didn't hold Jon and I back from exploring San Francisco on Monday.  It's a great city, especially when you just want to throw some pervs (look around) and not drop much cash.  We kicked it on Fisherman's Wharf and watched the sea lions that have a fine colony there, saw Alcatraz (but didn't take the tour), and ate a great sundae at the Ghiradelli Restaurant (nothing wrong with a "restaurant" that only has chocolate treats on the menu).  Mostly we just walked our asses off, which is some feat with all the hills up in there.  All in all, I give this city the thumbs-up: great public transportation (if I can figure it out, any fool can), clean, good views, and friendly folks.    AND DEN, on Tuesday, the big interview...I put my costume on and cabbed it over to the university.  The other interviewees were pretty friendly, mostly girls finishing up their college degrees (ha! the innocent fools...ain't got shit on me), and the atmosphere wasn't at all competitive, which you might expect.  Basically, how it works is, they have selected 20 folks to interview out of the 90+ that applied.  From those 20, they'll take up to 10, but if they only find 4 that they really want, then they'll only take 4.  The best thing about the day was the professor that's becoming the program director; we'll call him Seamus.  Seamus had a propensity for saying "and stuff," which is something you just don't expect from a really smart guy.  Here are some examples: "Welcome to Berkeley, everybody.  Hope you all have a great day, and stuff...we have a lot in store for you today.  Here's a schedule of what we'll be doing today.  And stuff.  Uh, let me know if you have any questions *3 second pause* and stuff."  I got such a kick out of this guy!  Luckily for me, he cut out the "and stuffs" during the interview; I don't know if I could have held in all my chuckles.    Anywho, after taking the redeye cross-country to NYC and then driving back to Boston, we got home this morning and were pooped like Mr. Hanky.  I have 3 more interviews coming up that I need to saddle up for; Alison, hopefully we can kick it in B-town when I come to check out IU.

For this piece, I specifically chose some shots that aren't Dan's best (for real, in those black and white shots is he trying out for Oliver Twist? Gunning for Eric Nies' spot on The Grind). The pictures only prove that, even when looking cheesy, Real World Danny is a beautiful, beautiful man.

Apparently, this stems from people using their hands to create quotation marks while talking...so they feel like doin' it where and whenever they want. Assholes! This example is from the Gallery of "Misued" Quotes: A sign at the swimming pool at Reed College in Portland, OR asks you to:  Please "shower" before entering the pool.  Maybe they knew that no one bothers with more than a quick rinse.  I hope they don't get a summons from the Board of "Health."    Once you read several, they start to get really funny. Anyway, it has always puzzled me that grandparents (mine and Matt's) have an addictive habit of using quotations in cards and other written messages. For example, Matt's grandma always writes  "Happy Birthday"   but does not quote any of the rest of the message, unless it is something like " and many more."  My grandparents do this too, and I always thought it was so weird. Maybe they don't really "mean" it?

Man, 10 bucks is sooo sad. Maybe we should put paypal on this site and raise some money so he can go see Heidi Fleiss like a normal D-list celebrity. The Smoking Gun also has police files on other Real Worlders/Road Rulers and of course most of them are on the drunken frat boy antics of various male cast members, and I'm actually surprised there aren't more public intoxications and DUIs in the bunch. The kicker, though, is that Stephen from Real World Seattle (he's the guy that hit the chick with Lyme disease and threw her bunny in the water, right? I know it's not "Kiera, I LOVE YOU!!! But I'm so angered!" David) has been accused of prostitution. I bet he charges more than a ten spot.

      Going along with the sing song headlines, I must share with you all about my lunch yesterday.  Now, on Mondays, I don't go to work until 12, which is just lovely.  So I go to Wild Oats on my way to work and create a salad at their incredible salad bar.  Yesterday I was having some trouble selecting a beverage until I spotted it...Dr. Wild, Wild Oats version of the fine Dr. Pepper.  What a find!  I have seen many generic names for the cola, but none quite as fun (Dr. Thunder comes in a close second).  So next time you find yourself at Wild Oats, try Dr. Wild, you won't be disappointed.    Sorry about the failure to include a pic, hope it doesn't spoil the fineness of our blog.  Kudos to Mike and Alison for coming up with a flashy color scheme!

The UberUniverse of Hell was momentarily glimpsed on Sunday as I saw Bush at the Daytona 500. Yes, I admit a soft spot for running across a race on tv, even if it's not in Indy. My dad and brothers are obsessed with racing, and I knew they were watching (and taping) this race. Anywho, races, especially Indy ones, (I'm sure half of proximity would concur) are a pretty janky display of all things contemporary American pride. After 9/11, flag appliques were abundant for all Indy racing apparel, including female racing lovers, which also opens up the doors for embroidered sweatshirts and the like (need I mention the role of denim in all this?!) I am pretty used to this, though, and just pass giggle and move on. I'm just surprised Bush took so long to get to this group-- because they've been ready and waiting for him since the beginning of his presidency. I have to admit I got a little queasy watching all his adoring 'fans' as he did a meet and greet with Laura (is she a robot?) and then the camera did a nice close up of his new Daytona 500 bomber jacket, which was embroidered with "George W. Bush, President." Thanks for not confusing us!  urlLink NYT chats  about how this event sealed the vote with all the "Nascar Dads." Hey, I speak from experience.

Our hotel was right on one of the canals and a quick boat ride to the beach....where we got very very sunburned. Right now I'm in the peeling stages and it's super grody to the max but totally worth it. On our last day there, we rented a scooter and the battery died, but it was still all good.

         Katie, I'll be joining you in California on Sunday!  Not that I'll actually be anywhere close to L.A., but what have you, much closer than I am now.  The big Berkeley interview is on Tuesday; I am sort of forgetting about Valentine's Day because I just want the day after to come.  I really hope California doesn't turn out to suck because I've put all my eggs in its basket (can I say Arnold's basket since he's the governor now?) and wanted to live there for years although I've only been inside the LAX airport.  I think characters in movies like "Dude, Where's My Car?" and the proximity (how's that for a sly plug?) to Mexico (and Mexican food) are the big selling points for me.  This from the girl who based her college choice partly on the fact that a Dave Matthews song was playing on the student radio station while driving around campus...

I don't know why, because I am not particularly crafty any other time of year. In fact, when I usually set out to make them, I realize all I own is white computer paper and blue or black pens. Really fun. So, I usually borrow some stuff from work or beat up a preschooler with a Powder Puff Girls backpack and take her art supplies. I usually do the pretty traditional V-Tine, with lacy accoutrements and maybe a candy heart or 2. But, I find them to be fun to make and give. Am I Martha Stewart? I usually only give one to Matt, though. Maybe it has something to do with not wanting to be out in Chicago on the 14th, because it seems half the world has gone crazy over buying roses and candy boxes. Or, getting dinner reservations at swank places that result in battle-to-the death behavior for the 7pm slot. We usually stay home, order pizza and watch movies...Also, we get each other small gifts, like a cd or snack. Is your city good for Valentine's Day, or would you rather hide inside your home? Anyone else hand-craft their love notes?

This is prob the most recent photo taken of me and while not flattering at all, I find it hilariously funny.  I've photoshopped out something in my hand.  I should have photoshopped my color but thats how pale I probably am, with a flash.  This is one of my favorite pictures of both katie and alison.  If this were a real valentine card alison's would say: "will you be my sullen valentine?"  I love it.  Speaking of sullen, Im hopefully going to be dressed up as Margot Tenenbaum tonight for a movie character party.  My backup idea is Amelie.  I wonder if ill get it together for either?

I wish Katie were here to serenade me. I love Valentine's Day because, significant other or not, it's a holiday that encourages eating lots of candy, so it's up there with Halloween and Easter for me. For some, though, V-day is about as pleasant as the shiesty card to your left. I decided to include something for everyone in this post:   YAY VALENTINE'S DAY!   Still looking for that last minute gift for your gangsta boo or homegirl...check out  urlLink these  adorable teddy bears holding little hearts printed with the romantic words: "Shit bitch, you is fine." It almost makes getting a stupid stuffed animal worth it. These bears are so fucking cute!  Or, take yo ass on a fantastic voyage from Compton to France to have a look at some of the romantic hot pink  urlLink luv graffiti .  Aww, even frat boys have hearts. Those old softies at Penn State declared all fraternity houses  urlLink rape-free zones . Wow, now I feel safe setting my beer down and not worrying that it might get spiked with a little funky cold medina. Ugh, I can't believe they had to mention this...there are even *ahem* OPTIONAL stickers for the frat's windows.   V-Day...Meh    Get flowers this year? Use this  urlLink handy guide  to find out what your boquet means.  My favorite is in response to the dreaded potted plant: "I feel you don't love me so won't be hurt if you give this to grandma." This is in the same category as the tiny potted rose combined with the plush teddy bear, the pinky-red azalea, or godforbid, the dreaded kalanchoe. Given by: the man who thinks it's over with you. Is it? Or are you Grandma? If so, you might be glad the old git remembered your address. Proper response: Double dose of Viagra. For both of you."    VD? More like Venereal Disease    These stories of  urlLink broken hearts  are funny and poingnant. The one that got me the most was the guy whose pregnant girlfriend chose a life of prostitution over him. These make any lame Valentines Day seem not so bad after all.   If you're feeling proactive, send some  urlLink anti-Valentines  or just take a look at  urlLink The Cap'n's Unfortunate Valentine's Cards , source of the lovely illustration at the top of this post.  The Cap'n's comments on it?  "To fall out of love is simply awful. But not nearly as awful as the sight of these horrific, bitter Valentine heads. Valentine's answer to drama's comedy and tragedy masks: angry and sleazy."    Happy lovin', lovelies!

Who do you have the hots for that isn't conventionally attractive or known as a sex symbol (we know all about your skeevy crushes, Leah)?   Anyone who knew me sophomore year of college was well aware that I had a raging crush on Hal Sparks, host of E's Talk Soup, now starring on Showtime's Queer as Folk...He also is incredibly funny on VH-1's I Love the '80 (and '70's). The obsssion was so out of control, all my Christmas presents that year were addressed as such:"To Alison, Love Hal" or maybe even "Dear Alison, Hal Sparks cuts farts." Yeah my parents are mature.    So I know Hal's not fly–even for a white guy, but he's funny and that's what melts my butter. Too bad he likes Kiss, we could never be together. So what are your wierd crushes, you freaks? For inspiration, check out  urlLink Normal Guys who Make Women Wild  for some Jerry Orbach, John Malkovich and Philip Seymour Hoffman lovin' (among others).  P.S. I was looking at the Hal montage, and I can't help but think he bears more than a passing resemblance to "Crazy" Pat Koenig in some of the shots. I'm I crazy?

         Were someone to invent a keyboard that gave the same satisfying clackety-clack of the old school typewriter, I'd surely invest in one.  I used to love pounding away on my mom's old typewriter (with or without paper rolled in) just to hear that sound.  Even if you're typing a lot of nonsense, that sound makes you feel like you're working ridiculously hard and should be winded after finishing your assignment.  I guess typewriter-computers wouldn't go over well in offices as all that noise would be enough to drive one a bit crazy, but for personal use, sign me up.

      After driving 30 minutes to work for 5 1/2 months, I have come to recognize a few cars on that drive.  The timing has to really be on for me to get to see these folks, and we only cross paths a couple times a week.  The first one I started to notice based on a license plate which reads "67A POO."  I'm guessing this is not a vanity plate.  I'd love to say this plate resides on a Range Rover or a hideous Hummer, for extra laughs, but no, it's fixed to a Mercury Sable.  How unlucky can you be...I wonder if when they first got the plate, they went along with it hoping no one would notice.  Come on!  Poo?!  I get a nice morning chuckle out of it, that's for sure.     The other guy is quite mysterious in nature.  He drives a shiny blue Beetle (a new one), and up until mid-December, the Beetle has a squiggly pride sticker fixed to the back right window.  Then suddenly, one day, the sticker was missing.  Luckily I can say with a great deal of certainty that it's the same car as I had memorized the plate number.  This incident has led me to many mornings of wondering what happened...why remove the sticker?  In my opinion, it made that car worth noticing.  Did he switch teams?  Was he visiting his mother and had to remove it because she wouldn't approve?  Did someone else take the liberty of removing it in an act of vandalism (or was it stuck on the inside?)?  Perhaps I'll never know.  I've been tempted to follow him to work, but who knows much further he has to drive than I do, and then I'd be really late to work.  Plus he might be a little freaked out.  Or maybe he'd be like, "Hey Indiana (as I still have Indiana plates), I've been wondering what brought you to Massachusetts!"  If some morning he were to pull over and get gas, I'd be tempted to pull over as well and strike up a conversation to get to the bottom of this.  Should I ever crack this mystery, I'll let you folks know.

         I have been meaning to post this for a while, but have not been in the office (I had a wee Americorps retreat and then went to Depauw on Friday to check out this exhibit they have in their new gallery about social stratification.  Very sweet!  They even had pieces of two of my fave lady photographers, Nan Goldin and Barbara Krueger...Sean was also a fan).    So back to my original postie.  Last Monday, my roommate, Gretchen, invited me to attend an event called "porneoke" with her at Birdy's.  Now this was actually the same week Birdy's was featuring Jordan Knight, but this was different.  The way she described it was that these bands go up on stage and play familiar songs but change the words to make them dirrty.  Hey why not, plus her psuedo-boyfriend is in one of the bands.  So we go and find out that she was wrong....very wrong.  Porneoke is, in fact, where they play muted porn tapes and call upon two brave folks to come up and narrate these scenes.  There were two bands that opened, but the fun was yet to begin!  I made up my mind that there was no way that I could be funny on the spot and would not be porneoking....I would much rather belt out "I will always love you" on stage.  But the crowd was small and the lady population was smaller.  Gretchen was recuited first and actually did well (but her partner was a lady, so it eased the tension).  Then they called Scott (the psuedo-boyf) and the blonde sitting next to him....I looked around, searching for another "the blonde", but to no avail.  So we go up there and I already told him the chances of me being funny were nill.  Then what do we get?  We get a cartoon scene with a witch who has a man eating vagina!  "What the....?" was about all I was capable of....and it just kept getting better.  The next scene we were dealt was a western with a pig and a cat all wooing this naked lady.  The pig was violent and shot the cat's penis THREE times (there was even a cartoon dramatization of the holes).  This was too much and had me in stiches......needless to say, we did not win the Princess Lea (?) pez dispenser that was the grand prize.    If any one is interested in attending, I believe it will be a monthly ordeal.  I would be up for going, but participating is another story :)

The Darkness is kind of cool.  I like revivals of the type of music.  My friend have a band called Dartanian after that beloved musketeer i think.  They are a big joke but are actually quite awesome.  They write all the songs to spoof the metal of yesteryear and present year also i guess.   urlLink Their site   has one of their songs that is called "River" i guess but I've always thought the title was "pissing on your grave" which i think is a much better title.  at any rate.  totally give them a listen. its lots of fun.

(His website is cool- features his comic book stuff and a blog.) I was a little turned off by the concept of the movie, because comics and I are not good friends, but it proved to be just excellent. Pekar's motto is "Misery loves company" so if you're not in a good mood, this flick could work wonders.   The documentary style bits interspersed throughout the movie (the real Pekar commenting on certain scenes, or just adding more to the story) were totally enjoyable and helped me understand him more as a person, which I think was one of the main goals, because Pekar had been kind of misrepresented by the media (namely Letterman!). The Letterman bits were really funny, and they used a lot of original footage there. Highly recommended and interesting. I also saw urlLink   Down With Love  , a completely different genre all together, but a clever spoof on bad 50's and 60's Doris Day stuff. Could it be possible for Renee Zellweger to be in more movies right now?

My profs thought the subject of sex was so tweaked by mores and other things at work in society that it was not "natual, fun, and not necessarily best if done one on one".  They were really crazy.  No one missed a lecture because you were never sure what they were going to do or say next.  I was reminded of them and a paper I wrote for that class when I read that Bernardo Bertolucci's new film "the dreamers" is out in NY and LA and coming next week to denver as well as many other cities im sure.  Im really excited to see it.  Its about an american student and cinemaphile who meets a pair of like minded twins who lure him into this bizarre relationship that they already have with each other.  Since im currently reading Lolita for the first time (in a little book club i have with john and another couple) i have sex and the social context of it on the brain.  All the pedofilia obscured by what seems like real love and adoration in Lolita makes for quite a conflicted view of the narrator.  Sexual taboos like cross-generational relationships, incest, domination/submission etc make for really interesting film and literature to be sure as it definitely challenges you to decide for yourself what exactly is taboo in your own mind.  Movies like Secretary come to mind.  Which, by the way, I think is one of the best love stories on film of the last few years.  The movie Storytelling comes to mind too, conversely though,because i find it extremely disturbing.    I was watching Curb Your Enthusiasm the other day and Larry DAvids manager Jeff told Larry that he was fantasizing about a pornstar while masturbating and that Larry's wife "popped in" to his fantasy.  Larry was mad and said "well, why didn't you pop her out??" to which Jeff said "you cant control who pops in!"   Storytelling popped in the other day and lets just say, thats a real mood killer.  It's so interesting the way movies that display their themes via sex can have such positive or negative lasting effects on viewers- or at least me.  Does anyone else have a similar experience?  Is different for males and females I wonder?

For the past few weeks, ok forget it...For the past few months, Mike and I have been amusing ourselves by singing tons of songs and replacing the proper names and pronouns with "Matt" and "Shan," or "Shannon" when we need more than one syllable. Yeah, I know it's lame, but it's the most fun we've both had in years! One Saturday night, we came home and sat on the couch for at least an hour and made up songs until I was literally laughing so hard I was crying. This is one game I highly encourage you to try at home.  Here are some personal favorites:  "Little Ditty about Matt and Shannon, two American kids doing the best they can. Matt's gonna be a chemistry star. Shan's debutante backseat of Matt's Plymouth Breeze."  Yeah, we like to add personal touches too. We're dorks.   "And Matt thinks it's gonna be a long long time. Till touchdown brings Shan round to find Matt's not the man Shan thinks he is at all. No, no, no, no....He's a rocket Shan! burning out his fuse up here alone! Rocket Shan!  Chicago ain't the place to raise your kids. In fact it's cold as hell..."  Sometimes they don't make sense, but it's still all good. Btw, that hit was "Rocket Man" by the great Elton John. I'm sure you could do something fantastic with "Benny and the Jets" as well.   You can do it with newer hits too!  "Matt's mind is tellin him no, but Shan's body, Shan's body is telling him yes. Now Matt don't want to hurt nobody, but there's something he must confess....Shan don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump n' grind"  Ok, a little graphic, but still fun. Try it...and Shan, watch out, you may be getting a CD full of personalized hits courtesy of Mike and Alison for your wedding! I gaurantee it will also include the theme song from Growing Pains, but we will take requests.

Read up on some more comparisons in  urlLink "Presidential Candidates? They Look More like Brat Packers to Us" . My personal favorites include Al Sharpton as Long Duck Dong from  Sixteen Candles  and Howard Dean as Duckie from  Pretty in Pink . Who knew John Hughes was such a visionary?   My real questions, however, are the following: 1. Are we ever going to have a candidate that resembles Jake Ryan, hottie senior in  Sixteen Candles ? Maybe Dean was miscast as Duckie. Check out  urlLink these photos  of a young Howie and make up your own mind. Niiice, I say. 2. If Kerry, aka Principal Vernon from  The Breakfast Club  gets elected, will he begin his inaguration speeck by saying: "You're mine, Bender...I mean America. For four years you're mine!"

      Ain't got nothin new to contribute in particular, but here are some random facts in the spirit of keepin' on with the blog.  1.  Have I mentioned that the street I work on is called Lovers Lane?  Cute, yes, but impossible to keep the street sign safe from thieves (next one they put up has my name on it), making it a tough street to find. 2.  They played "Flip Fantasia" as background music on NPR this morning around 10. 3.  One of my fish died two nights ago of mysterious causes; the two babies, however, are still maxin' out relaxin' in their special netted off area (aka, nursery...that's really what the box said). 4.  Rev. Al Sharpton is standing strong as ever in the Democratic primaries and got 3rd place in South Carolina (he received more votes than Howard Dean!).  Go Big Al! 5.  I can't take credit for this random fact since Jon came up with it but, nonetheless, here it its: Joe Lieberman sounds like the guy from Alf.  Too bad he dropped out of the race; I'm surprised he didn't make a bigger point of that, perhaps by having signs made that said "Vote for Lieberman" with Alf's picture on them.   6.  The premiere of the new season of Crank Yankers is next Tuesday, Feb. 10, so don't go making any plans for that night.      7.  I really hate reality tv but still watch it out of boredom and laziness occasionally.  The new season of the Real World looks terrible. 8.  Saturday is Jon's and my one year anniversary; cheers to that, and a good ol' fashioned salute to Jon.  Wahoo! 9.  Today at Subway there was a hair in Grace's sandwich, but the lady who works there is so nice I didn't have the heart to say anything.  I don't want any bad blood between us as I frequent this location for their righteous sandwiches, plus she looked clean. 10.  Also at Subway...the same hairnet-less woman put up a sign requesting people not to talk on their cell phones whilst ordering.  I wholeheartedly applaud that and told her so.  This earned me a couple extra tomato slices.

Big surprise, I am pissed off about something. Anyway, so as many of you who majored in the liberal arts know, English majors -especially grad students- can be majorly elitist and fight to the death for intellectual superiority. I personally think this is a bunch of shit, and I am unfortunately surrounded by people who honestly think they are God's gift to the world of theorizing about absolutely nothing. Granted, they think it is the most important shit in the world. Anyway, there is one guy I'll call Jackass, because that's what he is, who I recently witnessed being the most elitist of them all. So, Jackass and his friends recently formed a reading discussion group in effort to create more "community" within scholarship. But, they wanted to keep the group a secret and only include those that would contribute quality thoughts. Fine. One of our profs learns about the group and announces it to the whole class so that we may all consider joining. This old lady who is not really in the English department but is taking grad classes decided she wanted to be a part. Mind you, almost everyone in the dept HATES her. Most people are not a fan because they think she is stupid. I find her extremely annoying, but I think she is a little kooky and out of touch with what's going on. So, I witness her asking Jackass if she can be in the group and he says no- because they have too many members and everyone needs to contribute to the food because it's at people's houses, not on campus. She says she can contribute. JA says no, that they don't want to let any more people in and it was a mistake that it was announced to the class. So, the lady has some balls. She tells JA that although it may not seem like their group is trying to be elitist, they are, and she finds that silly considering that the group was inspired to form after a lecture on the importance of intellectual communities. I can understand why these assholes would not want her in the group, but this guy is soooo full of himself that he could not see why she felt left out. I try and avoid him because all he does it talk about other people in a very very rude way. So, I of course get stuck going home on the train with him, because he apparently likes me and I have no idea why. I am certainly not his equal because half the time we talk he "corrects" everything I say. So, the whole train ride home he freaks out about why old lady thinks he is elitist. Now, I was not invited to be in the group, because new students were not included in order to keep the conversation at a certain level, he says. I just thought it was hilarious that I had to sit there and listen to him go on when I, along with many others who I'm sure could have held their own in the chats, was deliberately not invited. One of the reasons I really dislike academia is because the students and profs can be so out of touch with the real world and just talking-or dealing with people. Jenny, be prepared! Hopefully psych is more normal. The old lady left Sociology to do English and apparently they were not elitist, so maybe you have hope.

      I thought of each and every one of you in the world of Close Proximity yesterday when I got my hair cut.  Needless to say, awkward conversations ensued.  I tried the tactic Katie mentioned of giving quick answers after awhile, but that didn't not deter this friendly gal.  She asked me how I came to this hair salon and I told her I picked it randomly because I liked the name.  REALLY?!?!  WOW!  Like that was a super-bold move on my part.  Then she asked me how long I had lived around here and I said 5 months.  "Don't you just love the area?"  I explained that I thought Boston was great but the weather sucked.  "Can't have it all," she said, disappointed in my reaction.  Oh yes you can, I thought to myself.  It's called California.  I kept this thought to myself as she was from here (which I felt obligated to ask, even thought she had a thick, unmistakably Boston accent) and quite protective of her native parts.  Then we chatted about football for a little bit, and it hit home to her that I was from the same Indinanapolis that the Indianapolis Colts are.  "Whoa...how 'bout that game?   Pats really showed 'em!" she said.  I supposed so, not really wanting to get into this as I couldn't care less whether the Colts made it to the Super Bowl.  She didn't want to drop it, and I must say I got a bit defensive of the Colts.  It's not like they suck and had no chance.  I told her my thoughts on the game and all she had to say was, "Well...Peyton Manning..." as though it were obvious what she meant.  What, that he played two perfect games before sucking it up in New England?  I just had that feeling that she was parroting comments made by other folks (yes, probably guys) and had no idea what they meant.  We moved on, and the discussion began to center around my hair...not my favorite topic.  "It looks GREAT!  This cut is just such a good LOOK for you!"  I'm glad she thought so but am also wise to the fact that your hairdresser has to make these comments.  She just wouldn't let it go.  Even when I was nearly finished and sitting peacefully under these weird heat-lamp things they had to dry my hair, she'd pop around the corner armed with another hair care product and slap some more crap on my hair to get it nice 'n stiff, just the way any helmet-head loving gal likes.  "Wow-don't you love the color?!  You have such beautiful HAIR!"  You can only enthusiastically say "YES!!!"  so many times before it fades into a dull, "whatever, fine by me."  Whew!  Glad that's over with.  And my hair's nice and short so hopefully I can avoid going back for quite some time.

       Last night, Jon and I went to see Bob Dylan play at this little club in Boston.  The show was pretty cool (from what I could hear, anyway...my ears are all plugged up from a cold), and we managed to finagle our way to a spot where we could actually see Bobby D himself.  Anyway, the funniest thing happened: two 40ish guys squeezed right in front of Jon and I and lit up a joint.  They were all hunched over it and thought they were supersmooth, until the security guard (who was, mind you, about 5 feet away) busted them.  It was great watching these clowns' reaction; I have this whole storyline in my head that they were both probably tokers when they were younger.  A few days ago one of them busted his son for weed, decides to confiscate the weed and then relive his glory days by smoking up at a Dylan concert (keep in mind that you can't smoke cigarettes in bars here).  Riiiiiiiiight.  Furthermore the joint was about half the size of my pinkie and definitely not worth getting busted over.  Lucky for these guys, security was laid-back and let them stay at the show.

No, not the full body fake tan experience, but I have to admit I'm very afraid that whatever I do will look something like that. I purchased some facial bronzing powder, but I have no idea what to do with it in order to avoid an orange face and an extremely pale body. I don't wear foundation, so I just know that the "mask" is bad but I don't know how to do it right. Do you guys have any tips? Can I wear blush and bronzer at the same time?

Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark ?  Bridge to Terabithia ?  The Color Purple ? These are great books, and there are tons more on this list that filled my hours growing up and helped make me who I am today. I can't believe these books are being challenged by zealots and overly nervous parents. So what, some of them are provocative and demand serious thought and attention from their youthful readers. I, for one, think more kids and more people in general need to be reading just about anything they can get their hands on instead of vegging out in front of the television as much. Most of these books were cited as having themes of voilence, sexuality and the occult. Like most movies and TV shows don't have that? Some of these cited books are mind-boggling too. I mean, um,  Where's Waldo ? Yeah, keep that crap away from my kids!   Even sadder are the pieces of great literature on this list, including Mark Twain, Harper Lee, J.D. Salinger, Maya Angelou. This is frustrating.

Then, you have to search again to get content. Does this happen to you?  This shit is messing with my head. I don't know if their snazzy title decor can help me work through this. Especially since there aren't any holidays coming up soon! Google still returns the best results, however. I guess that's the bottom line. Other search engines of choice?

There wasn't enough crowd to be doing that and its totally not allowed anyways.  John was so pissed as was I (considering it could have been really bad!) so we ended up getting in a fight (john punched, I kicked), and then I got kicked out of the show.  We ran down this alley to escape and for a few blocks in case his friends wanted to jump john.  It was crazy.

John got his rejectiong letter from Yale on Saturday.  After the dissapointment the reality set in:  We're moving to LA.  In a book I got about relocating there it said:  If LA is Hell, why is it so popular?    I'm really excited but just scared that I'm going to have a hard time getting a job at one of the two agencies I'm interested in.  I guess I had better get to work and start crankin'  This picture is from when John and I visited with Katie last year around this time.  He took this photo from the car on Sunset I believe.  Im so excited to be living near Katie again!!  Anyone else moving in the near future, or thinking about it?  My good friend here is moving to Chicago and trying to decide a good area to live in. She's going to be taking the L (or is it El?) to Evanston for Northwester but doesn't want to live too close to Northwestern because her boyfriend is going to need a job and wants the actual city experience.  Any suggestions??????

The Mars Volta, for those of you who may not have heard of them are comprised of two members of the post-hardcore/punk band At the Drive In.  I remember when ATDI was THE freakin thing like 4 years ago.  Well, they broke up and became The Mars Volta (singer from at the drive in and the guitarist) and Sparta (the other dudes.)  Cedric Bixler's voice can only be compared to Robert Plant's in its range and sheer amazingness.  They opened for a band called "A Perfect Circle" which was apparently a lot more popular than I had though based on the sold out-edness of the show.  THey kind of suck, but we left after one of their songs.  Gotta end on a high note I suppose.  Check out the  urlLink Mars Volta CD Deloused in the Comatorium  here and give it a listen.  The songs are so complex and rich.  Check their  urlLink site  to see if they are coming near you.  His performance is AMazing.  He jumps all of the stage and dances like a maniac.

         On my way to the doc's office today (yes, the biannual sinus infection is here and I want a sinusectomy), I passed a car with the bumber sticker "A hamburger stops a beating heart".  Just like anyone who knows Alison knows she sleeps in her makeup, anyone who knows me knows I have a soft spot for bumber stickers (exhibit A: the perkster).  This one takes the cake or shall I say hay?

          Yes, today is St. Patrick's Day and I, being the Cathedral grad I am, am going to pay homage to this hoppin' holiday.  It seems like this is the day of the year that everyone claims their Irish heritage, even if it means that their fourth uncle twice removed is married to a gal whose cousins are Irish.  Hey, why not?  Shout out to the Irish who are celebrating their patron saint today :)  Oh yeah and here is a link to a fun  urlLink Patty's Day activity .    It's great to be back to the blog!  I have been away from work (aka my computer time) for a while now, but attended some great conferences and got to hang with some fellow Americorps members for a couple days in Bloomington for a retreat.  It was an educational time to learn more about the presidential platforms on community service, different diversity issues, and other things during our sessions as well as kick it with my peers.  Shannon, I also met Matt's twin!  Seriously, I did a double take thinking "uh, does Mr. Hautman have a double life?".  You know how everyone is supposed to have an identical twin out there?  Well, Matt's lives in South Bend and his name is Ben.  I wish I could have taken a photo, but I think he may have found that intrusive!  Anyway, that's all for now.....

         "I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war If you can tell me something worth fighting for..."  I'll tell you what I want to fight for.  Naps.  I could use a daily siesta between the hours of 2 and 3.  Not only would workers be happier, I think they'd perform their jobs more effectively.  I'll also advocate for the distribution of adult-sized carpet samples on which to sleep, and perhaps pillows.  Another thing I'd like to see is nap rooms at restaurants; after a big meal, all you really want to do is lay it down for awhile.  While I realize this isn't practical, I still think it'd be nice.  Here's a  urlLink poem  for napping inspiration.

But look out, here comes the  urlLink Black and Blue album where Hov meets up with Rivers et al in a remix of Jay-Z's Black Album and Weezer's first album (uh, the blue one). This is such a cool phenomenon to me that an artist made a capella versions of his rapping so that anyone out there could make it into a unique creation. Way to go, Jigga! The guy who created these mixes writes about how he knows very little about rap, but creating these new songs inspired him to learn a lot more about an important music genre. Hands across America! Download some of the songs; they're actually pretty good. Or get proactive and create your own mix at the  urlLink Jay-Z Construction Set  (via  urlLink Gawker )

Let me tell you, it was so weird and interesting! I had only seen the show a handful of times (no cable at my place) and I wasn't too sure which one he was anyway. I was just wondering why he came to Loyola and what in the world he would talk about. My friends and I were totally surprised to learn that he is a JESUS FREAK. Who would have guessed? His speech, all about being yourself and gaining an inner spirituality (for him, through the healing arts) was all about his love of the holiness. Apparently, he was raised Catholic and graduated from Loyola New Orleans. Kyan's talk was really great, and I consider myself a fan even though I have no clue about his show. I did meet him after the talk (one of my pals was getting an autograph) and he chatted us up for a few moments. It was really nice to hear a pop-culture phenomenon talk and realize that there are intelligent, well-spoken, famous people out there who have "real" lives, love the Lord and their grandmothers.   Also, I saw   urlLink My Architect  , a documentary by Nathaniel Kahn, son of architect Louis I. Kahn. Louis had three families that were kept completely apart from each other until his bizarre death, and Nathaniel explores the three family connections while searching for a better understanding of his father, who he only saw about once a week and under very odd circumstances. The film was a little long, but really enjoyable and emotionally captivating. I really didn't care for a lot of Kahn's architecture, but his son really drew out the human qualities in the work. Nominated for best documentary at the Oscars.

         Did anyone catch the Simpsons on Sunday?  I watched part of it, and it was a really funny one about Raffi, a popular children's singer.  In the episode his name was Roofi.  Most of you have probably heard Raffi's classic "Baby Beluga," but I'd like to share some tidbits from other Raffi songs.  These verses pop into my head at random times and I can't get them out, so be careful not to start singing them to yourself, comforting as they are.  1.  "I may not know their lingo, but I can say by jingo.  No matter where you live, we can shake hands." 2.  "Biscuits in the oven, gonna watch 'em rise.  Right before my very eyes, hey hey." 3.  "All I really need is a song in my heart and love in my family." (this is the refrain, and the verses list other things Raffi also needs: food in his belly, clean air for breathing, pure grain alcohol for drinking...I must say, the refrain is pretty misleading.) 4.  "You may see a baboon basking in the balcony...a lion licking a lemon..." 5.  "This old man, he plays five, he plays five with his friend Clive.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh."  (Let's face it, Raffi has an edge to him most rock musicians would kill for.)  The whole point of this blog, and it was also the point of the Simpsons episode, is how ridiculous it is that a grown man can make a ton of money singing these lame tunes for kids who don't know any better.  Sure, they're clean-cut and soothing, but so are a lot of other songs.  It's the same thing that shocks me about someone's career being dressing up like the Gymboree clown and doing videos; what are they thinking?  Oh well.  I'll probably end up buying all of his cds for my own kids and he'll have the last laugh.

Last Thursday, my roommate Janel and I went to Crazy Horse for some cocktails. Crazy, huh? So we're sitting at a table when I feel something hit the back of my head. It's a partially-opened pack of gum. I turn around and there's an old man sitting behind me mumbling incoherently. The bartender comes up and tells us that this is his way of flirting with the ladies. Old man, noice!  Thus begins the full-on barrage of snacks. I know I felt hot that night. Seriously, this guy threw three Moon Pies, two Milky Way bars, two king-sized Snickers bars, tons of Life Savers, peanut butter crackers and a bag of peanut butter baking chips at us. Maybe I'm wrong but I thought guys bought girls drinks at bars to get their attention. Not if you're CRAZY.  I had to get a picture of the dude and when I turned around, he was soooo jazzed he actually flexed for me! Things got even zanier when he pulled a bottle of canola oil, a bottle of air freshener and some instant coffee out of his backpack o' fun. His lucky waitress got the air freshener, but not until he sprayed it all over the bar. Before he stumbled over and muttered for me to call him a cab so he could go to Waffle House, he tried to give Janel $20. It was like Halloween, only all your neighbors are the creepy old guy that you think might put poison in your candy. Oh yeah, he also got some water (I hope), mixed the instant coffee in it and then added a nice healthy dash of salt. Shudder, maybe he's better off not trying to buy girls drinks. OH YEAH, how could I almost forget? He also kept on taking out a pair of pink satin panties out of his bag and showing them around. All in all, the best/scariest time I've had at the C. Horse evah!

       Today has been a fun music day for me because I'm having an 80s revival.  There's nothing better than some 80s classics to get you revved up on the drive to work.  And I must admit, I like to rock out in my Camry; it can be odd at times to be sitting at a light and singing away, but what have you.  You get used to it, and hopefully it gives the folks around me a good morning chuckle.  Everyone can use a laugh at 7:30 am, and I'm happy to be the supplier.  At any rate, here's a top ten list of some of my favorite 80s tunes, and perhaps you all would like to add some of yours.  10.  If You Leave -O.M.D. 9.   Waiting For a Star to Fall -Boy Meet Girl 8.   Miss You Much -Janet Jackson 7.   Never Tear Us Apart -INXS 6.  Invisible Touch -Genesis 5.  Hangin' Tough -NKOTB (I had a fort in my closet dedicated to this band called "NKOTB and Me") 4.  P.Y.T. -Michael Jackson 3.  Melt with You -Modern English 2.  Don't Dream It's Over -Crowded House 1.  Blame it on the Rain -Milli Vanilli (I celebrate Rob and Fab's entire catalogue and yearn for a comeback)

I think the mix of comedians and politics is so funny and was really what Politically Incorrect should have been all along.  A friend who I share many interests with-especially relating to comedy hates Colin Quinn and sometimes I think it threatens my opinion of him!  Let me know if I'm alone here, or anyone else sees where I'm coming from.    Obviously I love Seinfeld.  I've seen Comedian about 5 times now and I want to own it.  I find it so incredibly insipiring.  Its amazing to see Jerry and Colin Quinn (who are great friends) and Chris Rock sit around and just shoot the shit, and more importantly, talk about how bad they think they are sometimes.  It really makes you realize that even if you are the best at what you do, you may not have any more confidence that when you were just starting out.   Even Seinfeld has bad days.  It really gives me hope in a field where being funny and smart every day is not easy.

It's the rare and elusive COSBY SWEATER in its natural habitat. Last weekend I went out with some people to Second Story to see the Impossible Shapes (good local band) play. Actually, the first band was awesome, but I can't remember their name. Aphora, maybe? The drunk girls in the bathroom who kept on pretending they had camera phones told me I was in for a "real treat". I think one of the girls was knockin boots with a guy in the band. Anyway, they rocked, but not as much as the fly gentleman in the Cosby sweater that cought both Janel's and my attention so we had to get a snapshot with the hotttness. Later that night, I chatted it up with Cliff Huxtable. You know I did-- and tried to get him to ask Janel out. No dice.   Too bad Janel wasn't as lucky as I was to score a date with her own Deluxe Hux. Check out this classic sweater on cassanova to your right. I love how Ian is giving not only the finger but an evil red chipmunk look. I met this guy at a party and immediately decided to make it my mission to ask him out based on that sweater alone. After chatting with him a bit, I got this picture and a date with Thomas, not Tom or Tommy...Thomas (and I'm almost positive I saw him this fall at Nicky Blaine's in Indy). He was a world class stroke (had to use Ian's word there) and asked my friends if I was a nice girl or a "money grubbin' ho," which, of course I so totally am! Cl-ass-y! Still most memorable for that dope ass sweater, though.

A member of one of the original citizen families of ancient    Rome.    2. A person of high birth; a nobleman.    3. A person of refined upbringing, manners, and taste.     adjective:    1.

In high school, this is something I consciously told myself I would not do. (I love my mom, and anyone who knows me realizes that this is all in good jest). Even though I was sporting the none-too-flashy uniforms until age 18, I was adamant that it was not that hard to have some style and not look totally dated and weird.  Case in point: my mom's wardrobe, even to this day, is a very bad mix of workout gear and the random piece of IHM/Cathedral wear, most notably including the navy turtleneck and some nice navy corduroys to match. All y'all can testify to the man's muscle shirts with some nice stretch pants tying it all in for Susie Coogan! Anyway, after thinking a little bit about my own wardrobe and style, I realized, what makes me above all this? I have slowly but surely acquired an obsessive love for sweatpants, corduroy uniform pants, and even the occasional Old Navy fleece vest to complete the sporty-casual wear. Yes, I've even taken it to the public. I've become so Susie-like that Matt can't figure out what to tease me about more- my lack of style, whether or not I've changed out of my pj's, or my likeness to Susie!   I know Alison has confessed her love for the Cheryl Slacks with coordinating tops. I knew it was coming! Is it totally inevitable, as hard as we try not to, to join forces with the mom style? I am going to try harder to look like I didn't just have a field day in the Old Navy Sportswear section, but I may loose. Sweatpants are nice, especially if they are red with elastic bottoms.

        +    Perhaps is the clouds, perhaps it's the day of Mon, but for some reason, I have been quite comtemplative and observant today.  While driving to work, I was behind this sport beheamoth vehicle that was sporting an environmental license plate and was struck by the irony of a gas guzzling monstrosity supporting the natural wilderness it's destroying.  hmmm....  Since Mondays are my late days at the Julian Center (I don't arrive until 12!), I go to the gym in the morning because then I feel like I have had a productive morning.  Since I have been doing this for the better part of five months now, I have some regulars that I swear with: the Washington Fire Dept makes an appearance if I get there early enough, the extremely skinny lady who runs like a ostrich, and these gals who once gave me some lip for using the very treadmill they ALWAYS use.  Anyway, today I was especially intrigued with some randon folks who came to join my workout sess.  First there was the man who was dressed in a navy turtleneck, khakis, and brown loafers going for a brisk walk on the treadmill (I was waiting for him to start jogging, but no such luck).  Then there were two adolescent boys lifting weights in their school uniforms and yahmechas (sp? and btw, I belong to the Jewish Community Center's gym, despite being a gentile).  So now it's cool to skip school and head to the gym?  Lastly, as I was leaving, I overheard these ladies discussing eggplant.  One was apparently pissed at some chef who did not make the eggplant soft enough and was complaining that "eggplant should be like butter, melt in your mouth"  (I was really tickled by the "like butter" being uttered at the JCC) and she was going to have words with this poor chef.    All in all, I had a great workout and threw some great pervs!

Freshman year I think I dressed like a bum except for when I went out, which was pretty often so maybe I was dressed better than I thought for most of freshman year.  Since then, and having moved to colorado and work at at advertising agency where the dress is VERY casual I have defintely adapted my style.  Here are some ways:  1.  Skate shoes and sneakers are cool.  I never used to wear ANYTHING like this but I have found that they can be both stylish and healthy.  I used to walk 20 min to and from class in three inch heels at CU.  I still dont know how I did that. 2.  Mini skirts are also awesome.  I wouldn't have been caught dead in a mini skirt a few years ago but now I think they are viable summer wear choices...Just so long as Im not wear a shoe with a heel.  That shoe choice with a mini transcends an outfit to hookerdom. 3.  Tight pants are ok...even pants that arent flared!  Ive finally let go of the idea that all my pants have to have a flared leg.  I really like it when my pants pool at the ankle.  Since my legs apparently arent long enough for them. 4.  Wearing a short sleeved shirt over a long sleeved shirt can finally look cool on me.  I have always admired this practical winter style on guys but now I have made it my own.  The key is wearing two shirts that are both VERY snug.  Then I won't look like im in my pajamas. 5.  The shorter an messier my hair is, and the longer I go without washing it, the more I like it.  I am actually coveting the paris hilton short hair cut but know that my hair isnt as fine and isnt blond so I wouldnt look that good on me.  But If I dont wash it it looks nice and flat!  I am growing it for the wedding so I can wear it back but as soon as thats over its chop chop again.  I HAVE to have it long in the front and short in the back.  I wont stray from that for a LONG LONG time.  What about you ladies?  Gentlemen?  How has your style  changed over the last 6 years or so.

There's little I love more than reading about kids' interpretations of rock music. In fact, one of my early posts on Proximity was about  urlLink kids' artwork inspired by Radiohead songs . They're just so hilarious and occasionally stunningly accurate. I also love, love, love how easily kids get distracted with their little fruit-fly-sized attention spans.  Go  urlLink here  for assorted music reviews and  urlLink here  for some hilarious marketing advice from 11 and 12 year olds to Guided by Voices (who by the way are playing in Bloomington on the 13th.)  Here are some of my favorite excerpts from the articles: Alvin: White people are always saying, "ooooh, I love you so much, are we going to a movie?, you are so beautiful as a flower..."  Sayed: "So beautiful as a flower?!" (slaps own forehead) man, you sound like a fool.  Alex: this is NOT good.  Sarah: you don't like it? why not?  Alex: baaaaaad. this music is making me die (flops to floor in exagerated death fall and sticks tongue out).    (about Yo La Tengo song "Autumn Sweater") Amanda: no, it's about a boyfriend. i know because i listen to pink, and she has boyfriend songs.  Devan: that's disgusting! miss allen, you should not be letting little kids listen to songs about a boyfriend. that's dirty.  amanda: it's not dirty! it's only dirty if they say the word "booty."  Carlos: they did say 'booty'!  Sarah: they did not!   (about Yo La Tengo song "Nowhere Near") This review is by two fifth graders that left me a note one morning: "Dear Miss A, We want to listen to your music. I am a DJ and Alden is a DJ. We are rappers too. We are experts of music."  Vince: Awwwww... Alden: I thought we were gonna listen to GOOD music. Miss Allen: You don't have to like it. But sometimes you can learn things from the songs you don't like. Vince: What I learned is, don't listen to Yo La Tengo again in my life! This is the kind of song when, you know, you're in the car with your parents, you say, "oh man, dad, you gotta change the station." Alden: Is Yo La Tengo on MTV? MA: Maybe. Alden: If I was on MTV, I would be so famous. I would buy 1,000 pair of shoes. Vince: Did they ever play with 50 Cent? MA: I doubt it. Alden: Well if they want to be famous, they should.

He's had a rough time sleeping on a friend's living room floor, being mauled by a dauchsund and rotting away in a data entry temp job. You know, pretty much everyday stuff for a 22-year old trying to make something of himself. In his quest to rock, however, I think he may have stumbled upon his true, or at least another, calling. He's a great writer; compelling, entertaining and utterly sympathetic as his own story's protagonist. Read his first four installments and see what you think.

Besides, who really wants their apartment to look exactly like a Pottery Barn catalogue....ex boyfriend Sideshow, that's who. Sooo not cool. Instead, use  urlLink The Rasterbator  to pixelate and blow up (rasterize) your favorite photograph or artwork and use it as wall paper.  You can print it on your own computer. There's a gallery for inspiration on the site. A lot of people of course use cliche images like Audrey Hepburn or Che Guevara, but I'm thinking this  urlLink Man Ray  Tears photo would be pretty fly. Another great site for messing with photography in a sort of Andy Warhol way is  urlLink Photowow.com . Go forth and adorn thy walls!

Gone is last year's harder  urlLink testosterone fest  (Queens of the Stone Age, Incubus, Ice T), well except for the Donnas, and I don't like them anyway.  Perry Farrell and crew have picked up, in my opinion, a much more independent, up-and-coming and exciting line-up that features great headliners like Sonic Youth, Morrissey and the Flaming Lips to represent artisits who have followed their own roadmaps along their long, successful careers. The newer artists are the stuff of my dreams too. I couldn't have asked for a better line-up: Broken Social Scene, Danger Mouse, Modest Mouse, PJ Harvey and a few bands I've never heard of. But I'm excited to see them based on the company they're keeping this summer. Plus, the two-day format should be a lot of fun and conducive to a relaxing, non-rushed atmosphere. Forget Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza's where it's at this year. Few tour dates have been announced, but keep your eye on  urlLink Pollstar  for a show near you. Also, check out the just-launched  urlLink official site .

                                         Welp, going along with the asking Alison to arrange some pics theme, here are some photos of when my mom, Tish, and I went to the  urlLink Exotic Feline Rescue  the other weekend.  She loves big cats like lions and tigers and, once she caught word of this rescue (and that it was only an hour outside Indy), she had to go!  We had a great time and really enjoyed getting to see the animals all up close and personal.  I also appreciate that they rescue these animals from people that are mistreating them or from the circus!  When you go, you have a guide that leads you around the rescue (which houses 132 big cats) along these paths that lead right next to their "exhibits" (I am not a fan of that reference, so I called them pens).  You can snap pics and observe, but steer clear of getting too close or else you might loose a finger or get sprayed (as this one fellow did in our tour group!).  It is a mere $10 to tour and all of the proceeds are used for the rescue.  The tour guides are all volunteer, as well as most of the workers.  All in all, it's a great place and I highly recommend going.  I think the highlight for Tish was seeing that there was a lion named after her!  Personally, I liked the wee cubs (they had 9 6mo old tiger cubs) and the scrap between two tigers (one in a water bin, the other being slapped!).  Grrrrrr......

      Here are some of my pictures from this weekend (Alison, I trust you'll fix these photos!).  My sister Natasha came out to visit and we had a rockin' good time.  The first couple are from the Cape and the others from downtown Boston...ohhhh goodtimes.  You'll notice that Natasha and I have on matching Boston sweatshirts...it got a little brisk out on Sunday so we had to invest in sweatshirts before walking the Freedom Trail.  Between the sweatshirts and the constant snapshots (Tash had 2 cameras, a black and white and color, plus my digital), I'm sure folks got a good chuckle at us crazy tourists.  Little do they know...

       I just finished reading "Dude, Where's My Country" by  urlLink Michael Moore  (and I would highly recommend it to anybody!), and towards the end of the book he talks about the upcoming election and who he thinks would be able to beat Bush.  Moore proposes that America's favorite talk show host,  urlLink Oprah Winfrey , run for president.  President Oprah!  I love it.  Vote Oprah!  Can you imagine the army of women out there campaigning for Oprah?  And if Dr. Phil got in on the action, oh man...he could counsel people about voting.  "Still considering voting for Bush?  Are you a masochist?  Self-destructive?  Come on now!  Do you want positive change in your life?"  That Southern twang always gets the crowd going.  In all seriousness, I would totally vote for Oprah (maybe partly just so I could say things like "Did you catch President Oprah's State of the Union address last night?").  I know Boots said that watching her show raises people's stress levels, but still...she gets things done and she is actually "in touch" with America.  Would you vote Oprah if you could?

We are enrolled in a class at CU that allows us to still be part of their advertising program and submit work to this competition.  The way it works is:  They send out this brief which describes a problem that needs to be solved with ads.  This year the assingment was actally to do ads for  urlLink The One Club  (the organization that puts on the competition.   The brief asked us to basically "raise the stock of advertising in the minds of consumers."  There are usually about 700 entries or so and there are 30 merit winners for the advertising portion of the competition and 30 winners for the design portion.  (these are separate contests with the same brief.  designers make posters while advertising entries have to be like magazine ads or billboards).  Last year the assignment was "the Newspaper Association of America" and the goal was to get 18-24 year olds to read the newspaper.  My partner and I got a merit in the show last year with our newspaper assignment ads.  This year though, my team got 2 merits which was incredibly exciting as only one other team in the country got two advertising entries into the show.  BUT they also give out a gold silver and bronze "pencil" which is what the award looks like (shown above) and we found out last week that we got a pencil!!!  We wont know which one until we go to the awards ceremony in new york on may 14 which one it is.  There is a monetary prize that diminishes with each pencil so lets hope its a Gold and not a silver or bronze although I'd be happy with any of them!!!!  The school is paying for my team to be there a whole week to do all of the things the One Show festival has to offer.  How cool right?  The best part is, well be in the  urlLink book  they publish every year in a special section for pencil winners.  This will surely help me a bit when I'm looking for a job as all the people im competiting against for jobs also participated in this competition.  So, basically this has been what i've been dreaming of for the last three years and its actually happened!!!

This 16mm color silent short will screen Sunday, April 25 at the Pink Pony in the 5 o'clock hour, directly after two vintage Saturday Night Live shorts starring John Belushi and Bill Murray.  Talk about no pressure following that act!   This was a final Motion Picture Production project that I completed in April 2002 with fellow IU students, Matt Bockelman and Jeff Moore.  Matt, the project's director who now lives in NYC, recently entered the project and was delighted to hear that we had made it in the festival.   This 6 minute short follows a woman (me) to her motel room to where she frantically hides and rehides a paper bag full of something suspicious, chain smoking and binge drinking all the while.  While it appears that she's been waiting for someone, she receives the knock at the door, and it is revealed that it's none other than the pizza guy with her pizza.  The bag she was hiding was full of pizza condiments; parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, pizza cutter, and napkins.  Have you ever seen anyone get that worked up over a pizza?   Ok, so it's kind of corny, but comes across pretty funny visually.  Lots of montage sequences which were SO hard to cut and splice together.  It's supposed to be a long-form commercial/short for a ficticious pizza place called "Lady Loca".   I know none of you will probably be in the area to go see it, but I had to share the good news that after being shelved for two years, "Lady Loca" will see the light of day.    Here are the details from  urlLink Arlene's Grocery  website.  If you know of anybody in the NYC area, tell them to check out the free event on Sunday!  “ARLENE’S GROCERY PICTURE SHOW”  FILM FESTIVAL ROCKS THE LOWER EAST SIDE WITH 4TH ANNUAL EVENT FRIDAY, APRIL 23—MONDAY, APRIL 26  OPENING NIGHT: FRIDAY, APRIL 23RD  FEATURING A PERFORMANCE BY JOE JACKSON & FASHION SHOW STARRING THE WORLD FAMOUS SUICIDE GIRLS  OPENING NIGHT SCREENING: 8:00 PM THE PINK PONY (178 LUDLOW STREET)  “TOBACCO PROMOTION EVENT”: 10:00 PM ARLENE GROCERY (95 STANTON STREET)  Back by popular demand, the 4th Annual Arlene's Grocery Picture Show takes over NYC's Lower East Side from Friday, April 23rd—Monday, April 26th. A festival unlike any other, Arlene's Grocery Picture Show puts the “independent” back in independent film. It's back—bigger, bolder and with less standards (translate: better) than ever. This year, more than 400 films will be screened at four LES locations, including The Pink Pony, Earth Matters, Lotus and Arlene's Grocery.  The 2004 Picture Show launches on Friday, April 23rd with an Opening Night film screening at The Pink Pony at 8:00 PM (Opening Night Film TBA!). All are invited to attend a “Tobacco Promotion Event” around the block at Arlene's Grocery from 10:00 PM onward. The after party will feature a performance by rock favorite Joe Jackson, a fashion show starring the infamous Suicide Girls... and FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY, Arlene's Grocery will throw caution to the wind sponsoring a “Tobacco Promotion Event” featuring Nat Sherman tobacco products (meaning, you can LEGALLY smoke at the venue all night long).  If all that ain't enough—the event is completely FREE to the public.

Swimming at Suppertime , a memoir by Carol Wasserman, an NPR contributor, had been taunting me on the shelf ever since someone handed it off to me.  It's a stream of consciousness type of book about her life in some podunky town in Massachusetts. I thought, ok, great. Summer is about to begin and this lady is going to go on for pages about how lovely summer, small town life, and the simple pleasures are for her. I can go for that. Now, the book isn't bad, but the way she writes gets a total F. In an effort to be "stream of consciousness," she writes sentences like: "I needed help with my gutters to I asked Ted. Who is my neighbor and a longtime resident of this town." I'm all for writing in whatever style gets you going, but a little knowledge of sentence construction and how things read might be helpful. So, I was not that impressed with the book. Much rather go for Mary Carr's  The Liars Club  and  Cherry  if I'm in the mood for memoirs.

Get your landubbin' selves to the nearest Long John Silvers on May 10 for  urlLink free giant shrimp , or walk the plank. And don't forget to ring the bell for good service. I'm serious.   On January 16, the stinky seafood eatery announced that if the second Mars rover found evidence of an ocean on the planet, it would give out free a giant free shrimp. They're sticking to in on Monday, May 10 from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. That's "one small step for mankind, one giant leap for shrimp!"

Now, I know that Jennie mentioned that she loves her Nalgene in a previous post.  Pretty much everyone in all of boulder owns a Nalgene.  We own two in fact.  I barely ever use mine because I don't drink enough water but they are really nice for hikes and things.  Well, come to find out that the company that makes Nalgene called (Nalge Nunc) makes the plastic containers used to restrain animals for animal testing.   urlLink nalgene.jpeg  In fact, they are the number one maker of these such products.  Its really shocking!!  I will never use a Nalgene again!!  Completely disgusting.  BUT, the good news is that there are lots of other manufacturers of water bottles that are made of the same exact plastic material that makes the Nalgene bottles so nice.  They gave me a flier with a website www.boycottnalgene.com but the site doesn't exist yet.  The Rocky Mountain Animal Defense people sell alternative Nalgene like bottles on their site.  So, if you want to have a cruelty free bottle, click on the Store button after reading the article on their site.  (its one of the links below)   urlLink Here  are two short  urlLink articles  about Nalgene.  Even if you don't use one, it's sort of eye opening.  I can't imagine how many of the other products I use on a daily basis are made by companies lacking similar morals.  Lets get a count, who has a Nalgene?

Some were easy, like Winnie from  The Wonder Years , and some stumped even Katie....No, Sandy Duncan and her glass eye and box of Wheat Thins are not up in this piece. Scroll on and all will become clear:  Up first:  We have  urlLink Josie Davis  of Charles in Charge....No, not the hotter one, Nicole Eggert of Baywatch fame. The little sister. She grew up well though and went on to bit parts in Law and Order and 90210.      Next up we have  urlLink Tina Yothers , baby sister on Family Ties (until damn Andrew came along....bring in the baby to help struggling ratings). I bet that dark hair threw you off. Not only was the Tinster immortalized in a great South Park episode, she has her own rock band and looks like "fat Courtney Love" according to Ole Macky.       How rude! Not all of you figured out this was  urlLink Jodie Sweetin , aka Stephanie Tanner, the middle sister on Full House. She's pretty much done jack shit since the end of that gig. Everywhere you look...you don't find old Jode.        Hey! It's  urlLink Kerri Green , adorable redhead from Lucas and the Goonies. I always liked her. Did you know she's 37 now? No way! Actually, she's not really acting anymore but has done some directing.Namely a film called Bellyfruit about teen pregnancy.  Way to be, Ker.       Now it's time for  urlLink Staci Keanan , star of My Two Dads (with Paul Rieser and some guy that looked like George Michael--how apt.) and Step By Step (HURL!). Nobody got this one surprisingly. I have a question though....I can't really remember My Two Dads that well. Were the dads lovers? If so, how forward-thinking for the time. Anyway, Staci has been on the Valeri Bertinelli careeer path as of late...that means lots of TV movies.       Remember  urlLink Jenny Lewis ? Such a cutie and looked so much like Kerri Green. Even her hair's the same now (scroll down and look at her grown-up pic). Back in the day, you had to feel sorry for her because she was Shelly Long and Crain T. Nelson's daughter in Troop Beverly Hills. In 1998, she had a part in Pleasantville and now....she's the lead singer in indie rock band Rilo Kiley. She even did the girl parts on last year's Postal Service album....AND had a fling with Ben Gibbard AND dated Jake Gyllennhaal. So green with envy.        Ahh, Winne Cooper. Or  urlLink Danica McKellar  of The Wonder Years. Such a cute kid and she grew up to be pretty too. She has been in a bunch of stuff but nothing I recognize besides some episodes of the West Wing. Interesting fact: Winnie's real name on TWY was Gwendolyne Cooper.        Aha! The blonde Sandy Duncan lookalike is actually  urlLink Mia Sara , Sloane Peterson from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. She's back to brown now, but I couldn't believe how unrecognizable she was in that picture. Like K. Green, Mia's also pushing 40, which just amazes me and makes me feel kinda old.  She's done some guestwork on Oz and get this: her father-in-law is Sean Connery.        Last but not least, it's  urlLink Ashley Johnson  or lil Chrissy from Growing Pains (yes they had their own annoying "baby Andrew too") Comparing the rise and fall of both GP and Family Ties might warrant its own post. I mean, think about it....rebellious Mike Seaver and Mallory Keaton, studious Carol and Alex P....lame Ben and whatever the hell Tina Yother's name was....the similarities abound. Anyway, Ashley lost the fro and played Mel Gibson's daughter (poor thing) in 2000's What Women Want.      What this woman wants is to go outside and enjoy this noice weather. It's quitting time and I'm sitting in a windowless office typing this all out just for you. Can you tell I love you?

         Some of you may be familiar with the street Meridian in Indy.  You know that this is a main highway/road in Indy and is quite populated with automotive traffic at all times of day.  As I was driving to work yesterday, I spotted a lady riding her horse donning a whitle bicycle helmet along Kessler Blvd towards the Meridian intersection.  I was fascinated and rummaged through my purse to locate my digital camera because this had to be documented!  When the light turned green, she and Mr. Ed trotted across the road and continued on their way.....it was awesome.  I did snag a quick photo, but my computer skills are nill and I have yet to download it from my camera.  It just goes to show that nice weather merits all sorts of tomfoolery in Naptown!

You can read it  urlLink here  at Popmatters, a web magazine for which I have been doing some freelancing these days. The Wrens are a great band, by the way, and I recommend checking them out if they hit the road again any time soon.    Last night, Mike and I headed to the Patio to see the  urlLink Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players  so I could interview them for an upcoming article. If you haven't heard of them, here's the crazy but true rundown: The band is a dad, mom and 10-year old daughter who travel from show to show in an '83 Suburban (Big ups to Jimmy Coogan, y'all!). The dad sings and is on keyboard and guitar (and looks a lot like Rick Moranis). Daughter Rachel (Rachel!) plays drums and sings harmony, and Mom (who looks like Kate Pierson from the B-52's) works the slideshow. Yes the slideshow. They write songs that have to do with stories told through vintage slides from the 50s, 60s, and 70s. An interesting family unit if I've ever heard of one. The fam was really nice and we had a good interview at a super swanky joint called La Bamba's. Hey it was late! And that means I didn't get home until 1 a.m. and woke up at 7:30 this morning when I had to be at work at 8. Looking (and feeling) hott today! I have to give a shout out to Mike for letting me sleep in the car on the way home though. Thanky kindly, Ole Macky!

         Today is blue day for me.  I broke up with Sean, my (ex) boyfriend, last night and it was not fun.  It's almost 3:00pm and I am bored, so I have been thinking my favorite things to cheer myself up.  Here is what I have come up with:    Root beer floats        I gave up soda for Lent and have just started getting back into the swing of  carbonated bevs since Easter, so the root beer float is a perfect way to fuse soda with my fave food, ice cream!     Drumsticks         Not the chicken kind, the ice cream novelty kind.  They used to be standards at my dad's house when I was a youth and I have just rediscovered the goodness.    Yoga        Something I stongly recommend for anyone.  I have a weekly class that I attend on Tuesdays (for FREE!) at my gym.  Very relaxing and soothing.      Fella          My little black cat is the best!  He does funny things that make me laugh and has quite a personality.

I head on over to  urlLink Salon  to see what's going on today and their banner ad is for a company called  urlLink Godsend.org , a company that specializes in human cloning. Is this for real?  If so, I feel like I'm in the middle of a mix between the Twilight Zone and Pet Sematary. The mission of the company seems to be mainly for parents who have lost their children and would like to clone them:  "Since Dolly, several scientists have cloned other animals, including cows and mice. Now, at Godsend, we have pioneered a technique that allows a cell nucleus from a recently deceased child to be implanted within a human egg, allowing a mother to carry that child to term again.  In theory, this new child would be identical to its predecessor in every way. By creating life from life, Dr. Wells and his crack team give nature a gentle push, and help to rebuild shattered families."   This raises so many alarm bells and fears I don't even know where to begin provided this is a real company that offers this service. I imagine it is since it's on Salon and the site lists  urlLink testimonials . Why haven't we heard about this before? Or am I really in the dark here? Is this legal? WTF?

They call it the "Anti-Panti" available on their  urlLink website  for only 10 dollars for five.  They are meant to banish thong sticking out above jeans forever.  Im still skeptical but think ill have to try it to see for myself.   Here is an excerpt from the dailycandy email:  Ladies, behold the future: the Antipanti. Designed for lowrider enthusiasts, panty-line haters, and, well, anyone yearning for a little more freedom (who isn't?), it's a disposable patch of cotton flannel that you stick to the inside of your jeans when you're going commando, thereby protecting both the crotch of your pants and the crotch of your, um, self. Available in cute patterns (camo, gingham) and way softer than that strip of nylon you're usually sporting between your legs, the Antipanti is the perfect solution to your thong-above-the-waistline problem. When you're done, just peel off, discard, and get on with your life.  Can the panty get any smaller than this?  Let's hope not.   What do you guys think? Is anyone else curious?

       So, Arizona it is!  Jon and I just got back from visiting Arizona last night and made the decision to move there.  We had such a good time...we flew into Phoenix on Friday, and Friday afternoon went to ASU where I met with a few of the professors that I'll be learning from/working with next semester (all very cool).  But I won't try to fool you into thinking the professors impacted this decision at all...once I saw the plethora of Mexican restaurants, I was sold.  My brother John showed us around the area; everything is so new and clean and, most importantly, WARM.  Then Sat. we took a road trip up to Sedona, which is just a couple hours away.     It's a really beautiful area with all these mountains and red rocks.  We did a little mountain biking, checked out an art fair (it's a really artsy place), and drove to a winery (yeah, a winery in Arizona...not bad, though).   We stayed in Flagstaff Sat. night at this great hotel where you get FREE DRINKS from 5:30-7:30, free massages, and free breakfast the next am (Embassy Suites...and yes it is a national thing, we asked!).  What's amazing about AZ is you pass through a different ecosystem like every 20 min. you drive; Flagstaff is just 2 hours away from Phoenix and still had snow in the mountains.  I'm really jazzed about all the trips we can take from Phoenix...Mexico, Vegas, Southern Cali...all not too far at all.  Good times...and all visitors welcome.

      I believe that all y'all except Katie and Leah have seem my roommate's cat, Jupiter.  He is a grey tabby cat with white paws and what I call tan "squirrel fur" on his tummy.  His is also a husky cat, living up to the name Jupiter.  Most visitors comment on Jupiter's size and weight, but he doesn't seem to mind.     Anyway, this cat, Mikesch, has Jupiter out weighed by at least a couple kilos....

       Okay, so out of the whole Proximity crew, I probably score a 2/10 when it comes to hair issues.  I have purchased and experimented with perhaps eight hair products in my entire life and never really felt like I needed any of it.  But, before you shoot me, I have finally found a product that I can endorse:  urlLink Garnier Fructis' Fiber Gum Putty  (or something like that).  It's this wicked stuff that is like pomade mixed with hair gel mixed with cotton.  It claims the "no stick" factor and lives up to it, but trust me, I doubted at first.  I tend to use mine prior to blow drying, but it can also be used on dry hair.  All it does is help my hair fall into place without much styling (because if my daily beauty regimen starts taking more than 10 mins, I need help!), but also allow me to tweek when necessary.  All in all, I cannot do enough to describe the glory that is this product.  Since my hair isn't curly (Shan, Alison, and Jenny), I cannot test that market, but I have faith.  So go and buy this, $2.99 at any Target!

         Okay, so last night my roommate, Gretchen, and I decided to ditch working at Sully's (it was nauseatingly slow!) and go out for dinner.  We went to a little cafe in Broad Ripple and ordered dinner; I got the vegetarian lasagna.  While we are waiting for our food, we sit and chat for a while and then start digging in once our chow arrives.  Now I knew that the lasagna was made with fake meat, according to the waitress, and figured it was worth giving a whirl.  It was awesome!  Now I have never been a big fan of the whole fake meat thing, having only tried the "not dog" hot dog, but this was like turning over a whole new leaf.  So our waitress comes with our check and is acting awkward and uncomfortable.  She begins to explain how she accidentally gave me the real meat lasagna and hopes it wasn't a problem.  Ordinarily, I would be annoyed, but not this time since I enjoyed the lasagna so much.  It lead me to an epiphany: I like meat and am swearing off vegetarianism.  It's been a great ride and I figure, if I like the stuff, why not?  Teddy will be proud, no more grazing in the yard.  By the way, April Fool's!  On a serious note, I got a 23% on the whole Emo-quiz as well....I guess I need to tap into my emotional core.

Last new year's eve, we were chatting about emo and he came up with some FANTASTIC band names...."Morning Misery" and, even better, "Seven Inches to Pain". Some seriously funny stuff comes out of that stoner sometimes.   Anyway, I found this hilarious list of emo band names based on the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  urlLink Have a look for yourself . For my money, nothing beats "Sausage King of Chicago."  This got me thinking about other movies and the wealth of untapped emo band names that may spring forth from their creative riches. This made me so sad, I had to go change into some converses and cords and go in my room and cry and wail along with Dashboard Confessional.  On a related note, take the  urlLink How Emo are You?  quiz and join me in my semi emo-ness world. And just for fun, come up with your own band name from a movie...preferably John Hughes. He's just so  EMOtional . Mine would definitely be "Shit Twice and Die" from Sixteen Candles.

We've been together for something like five years (my math skills are pretty fuzzy, as is my concept of time in general). My beef: some people (who I am not mentioning on purpose)  send us letters or cards, they are always addressed to "Mr. Mathew Hautman and Shannon." After all this time, it drives me nuts that no one has ever bothered to figure out my last name!  This is a personal pet peeve of mine. I know that after the wedding, this issue will no longer exist because now everything will be addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Mathew Hautman --whatever--, but I am offended that I always appear as some afterthought on a paper correspondence. I guess I'm also hyper-aware of this issue because making sure you know everyone's proper names and LAST NAMES for wedding invites has taken up a lot of my time. I feel like its the equivalent to being known as the random "guest" on the invitation. That's cool, but if you know the person, figure out what the hell their name is, dammit!

Earlier this week, we got into a discussion about the great days of making mixed tapes for your friends, and I think a summer mixed CD from all of us to everyone who wants one   would be an awesome way to pump up the volume, kick out the jamz and kick off the summer. I want Katie, Jenny, Jennie, Leah and Shan to all pick out five songs they think would make fun additions to a mixed CD to listen to with your t-tops off your Firebird, your daisy dukes cut so short the pockets hang out and the tall boy in your right hand nestled up all tight in your favorite beer koozie (can you tell the 500 is on Sunday?). Put them in favorite order from 1-5 and I'll try to fit as many possible on the disk. Other than that, no rules, just right. Anyone else who wants one can leave a comment with their e-mail and I'll get to you; any input on the songs is welcome too. If this goes well, I'd like to do one quarterly for each season. Here are mine.   Alison's 2004 Summer Mix CD picks  1. Sexy Boy by Air 2. Pacific Theme by Broken Social Scene 3. 1976 by RJD2 4. This Charming Man by The Smiths 5.

The editors claim that various US officials and Iraqi informants presented conflicting and sometimes false information that would paint a flattering portrait of the US government. Apparently, nobody bothered to check the validity of the sources. Rumors are also circulating that the US "gave" the media the information about the 7 potential terrorists in order to deflect attention from the Iraqi prison scandals.    I guess I'm surprised by this because I feel, for some reason, that I can "trust" the NYT more than other news sources. What it comes down to, though, is that I often forget to consider that every faction of the media has a certain amount of self interest and backers (financial or otherwise) that they must answer to. To boot, they buried the editorial on both the web site and the paper itself. In my mind, this should be front page news!!    Is there any facet of the media that you "trust" more than others? From now on, I'm not listening to anyone but my fellow bloggers.  Being the dork that I am, we will end with a quote from Virginia Woolf: "Therefore, if you want to know any fact about politics you must read at least three different papers, compare at least three different versions of the same fact, and come in the end to your own conclusion" ( Three Guineas ). I guess we have some work ahead of us.

The New York Times examines the  urlLink blogging trend  and tries to answer the question of why people become so attached to their sites. Is it simply a way to get something off your chest? A shot at Internet immortality? An ego-stroke? Or just people getting involved in their hobbies like people tend to do? I don't know. A little of everything?  I started the site last fall to keep in touch with the five other girls who post here, and I'm so happy we've kept it updated. But I have to admit, it's evolved into another aspect of my life. It makes me feel productive when I'm at work and don't want to do my "real work". I'm not just an observer; I'm contributing something. I read a lot of other blogs, and I guess having one of my own (albiet shared) makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger than my immediate surroundings. But we're lucky, we get feedback, if only from this blog's posters, a built-in audience. Does anybody else read this thing? Does it matter? What do you make of the blogging phenomenon? Or better question, what do you get from it?

       I'm always looking for some fresh new jives to get the party started (aka, jolt myself into reality) on my way to work, and I thought you gals might be as well.  So here's a band that I was introduced to by a British friend while in New Zealand (I still feel like I owe her one, that's how great they are!).  They're called Groove Armada.  I'd recommend "Goodbye Country, Hello Nightclub" or "Lovebox."  If you guys have some suggestions, that'd be great.  It's too bad mixed tapes are no longer hip...I'd totally throw a Groove Armada tune on there in the #1 spot!

       Last night I went to this club Kameleon with my neighbor, Amber, and some pals from  Sully's to dance dance dance to some fine 80's tunes (the new wave kind, not so much Starship).  Of course some of it sucked, but once the DJs got their groove, it was The Cure, Interpol, New Order, James, Blur etc. all the way.  Goodtimes....  Anyway, one of our convos was about how the Catholic Church had recently proclaimed that they will not distribute Communion to any parishoner who is involved with abortion practices(aka a doc who performs them, etc.).  Now is my church, just this past Sunday, our priest gave us a lecture about leaving early and coming late and then dropped the bomb: apparently some people in our church have not been eating their host at Communion and have been leaving it in the pews and song books instead.  Of course for a devout Catholic who believes that the host is actually the body of Christ, this is a tragedy.  As for me, I was just waiting for him to say "The body of Christ does not belong in the pews or the song books, it needs to get in your belly!".   Oh and btw, The Cure, Interpol, Mogwai and others will be touring this summer, according to the Cure's website.  Looks like Cincy, Chi-town, and Detroit are all on the list, but no Indy....

        and a happy day for me!!!! im not sure why I am taking such delight in the news that jam band extrordinaire  urlLink Phish is finally breaking up !!!  I'm not sure what makes me so happy about it really.  I guess it's because I really hate them.  I also really hate faux hippies, which make up Phish's core audience.  I mean, COME ON!!  Those stupid ass stickers and patches that their devotees manage to put everywhere, and act as a mating call to each other.  Driving around you see Jesus fish, and Phish fish on people's cars and I think, what's the difference?  Either way the driver is devoted to something equally generic and also feels the need to tell the world about it.  I'll apologize to anyone on this blog that happens to like them,  oh hell, no I won't.  I'm going to relish this for at least an hour.

       &emailalert=no&email=adgrant@indiana.edu&url=http://closeproximity.blogspot.com&name=Proximity&bgcolor=003399&fcolor=FFFFFF&link=FFFFCC&words=comments&title=Comments &width=350&height=350">   Do you ever have that not-so-fresh feeling?  Sorry, just had to say it.  Rather, do you ever have that I'm-feeling-fresh-in-my-car-and-I'm-gonna-see-if-this-car-maneuver-works feeling?  Yesterday, I was driving, high off a final interview for an assistant position at an amazing art school out here, to where I found myself smack dab in the "right turn only" lane.  If it'd been within my first year out here, I would've gladly turned right and figured out where I could turn around.  Quickly though, one realizes that blocks in L.A. can be longer than the unemployment line, which ultimately leaves you stranded on some one-way street with nothing but a headache and a hot car full of regret.  Besides, everyone else weasels their way back into the straight lane, so why can't I!  One car passes, then two, and now the people behind me are getting angry at the four door gray car with Indiana plates, who clearly doesn't know where she's going or what she's doing.  Yes, two years out here, and I still have IN plates.  It's cheaper that way.  Little do the legitimate Cali drivers know, I've been a P.A. out here, averaging 600 miles a week all over L.A. into the Valley and back again into Hollywood, learning every road along the way.  So I slipped up just this once...let me in dammit!  A champagne colored Mercedes is going just at the rate to NOT let me in, so instead of waiting, I'm ticked off that for some reason this guy doesn't want to help an Indiana girl out.  Instead I floor it, merge left, and revel in the fact that I beat the Mercedes Man who clearly wasn't in a giving mood that day.  At the stoplight, I glance back in my rearview mirror to see the Mercedes Man (MM) flipping out, making gestures at how insane it was that I merged in front of him, and just having an all around shit fit.  Normally I am against flipping the bird in traffic, as you never know who's packin' heat, but this time I just let the finger fly, and boy was that the wrong thing to do.  As the light turns green, I proceed en route to my local bank, only to find that after multiple blocks passed, and MM is still on my tail.  At another stoplight, he's sticking his head out the window screaming something.  At this point, I'm a little bit scared, wondering if this was that one person that you shouldn't flip off today.  I think this whole event had less to do with me, and more to do with his bad day that he was choosing to take out on little ol' me.  "If he turns into the bank parking lot, take that back exit you know will lose him," I tell myself.  Sure enough, he follows me into the parking lot.  "Shit," I yell as I floor it through the parking lot, behind the library, down the alley, only to bottom out my car going back onto the street.  He was not far behind.  This is where knowing these streets came into play.  I veered around a car parallel parking, and nestled myself in front of a parked car and beside a car going through the light.  "Turn right, turn right, turn right," I chant as I'm waiting for through traffic to go as I'm waiting to...you guessed it, turn right.  I safely turn right, only to find a street sweeper taking its dear sweet time.  MM is now behind me again, making his move to get next to me.  I locked the doors and jotted down his front license plate number in my rearview mirror, all the while calculating my next move.  I was running out of moves.  This is NOT the way my afternoon was supposed to go, and I can't believe this ass is really following me.  Is it my fault for merging, or am I absolved due to the fact that this sketchball is now tailing and chasing me?  As all of these thoughts race through my head, he squeezes in next to me, stops, and yells in broken English, "Vat ahr yoo doing, clazy lady?!!!"  At this point, I'm laughing, as this guy is just a harmless prick who doesn't let a woman push him around.  After all of that, THAT is what he says to me?! In one fluid motion, I took the pad of paper that clearly has the make and model, along with the license plate number of his car and SLAMMED it against my window, letting him know that if he continues to screw with me, I'll call him in.  He did the finger wag one last time, and merged left in front of me.  How fitting.  I saw him to the light, to where he turned right and left in a huff.   At this point, my adrenaline is pumping, and I'm disoriented as hell.  I wasn't sure if I should go to the bank just yet, so I drove around for a little bit.  After driving a few blocks, who blindly cuts me off, but MM.  Screw the bank, I'm cashed.  Off to my apartment I go.  What's the moral of the story kids? No, not that you should've wasted three minutes reading elsewhere.  You can take the crazy guy out of his German car, but you can't take the middle finger off the German girl.

       It's 3:00 and I am bored at work, so why not post again?  I read  urlLink this article  on Indy Star online today and it piqued my interest.  Apparently Muncie, IN is banning people from displaying the Confederate Flag while staying at this public park/campsite.  This also appears to be mainly a trailer park inhabited by people from a low socio-economic class.  But it made me think of a larger issue, why the Confederate Flag?  Now, according to people I have met from the South, the Confederate Flag is a symbol of "Southern Pride".  Others view the flag as having a latent meaning of hatred for African-Americans or minorities in general.  I asked some of the ladies at The Julian Center about their opinions and most of them agree with the latter, but they were also all African-American.  Personally, I am very intrigued with how people view symbols and I often find that most symbolic objects are not given just one, face value, meaning.  What is your take on this?      Also, while I searched Google for this photo, I came across a book that you might like to read if you are interested in the evolution of the Confederate Flag.  It's called "The Damned Red Flags of Rebellion" by Richard Rollins.

         So after a kickin' start with The Stills and crew show on Friday and a fine breaky with Al, Mike, and Aaron on Sat, my weekend took a turn for the worse: I had to attend my cousin's graduation from Cathedral on Sunday (bummer I had to work on Sat and miss the Open House....free drinks!).  Now I have suffered through two graduations myself, but they were my OWN graduations, so it never occured to me that I was putting my beloved family members through ulitmate hell by asking them to attend.  Now parents are one thing, but I had my brother, grandmother, and uncle at my high school graduation....how mean!  So yes, Allison's graduation was not fun since I didn't know any of her classmates, stupid Mr. Rhoades was the speaker AGAIN, and it took almost three hours.  Of course it was nice to see her prance across the stage and accept her diploma holder, sans diploma, from the second balcony of Clowes.  Had they not announced her name, I wouldn't have been able to distinguish her from the rest of the crowd.  About the only bonus was getting to hit up Steak and Shake with her sibs, Phil and Rachel afterwards....mmmmm, chocolate chip shakes alive.

We rented  urlLink Elephant , Gus Van Sant's latest movie. It's about a Columbine-esque high school shooting and follows serveral randomly selected students as they go about their days before the shootings. It's also one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't be fooled by the stills at the official site. Yes they're beautiful, but that didn't help the movie from making me feel like I was back in First Communion class feeling so antsy and dying to pee. Elephant and I got off to a bad start when it opened and Gus' name was larger than the movie title. I mean, come on! He's not THAT famous. What's he done besides Good Will Hunting and Finding Forrester (which also sucks)?   The movie is also only 80 minutes long (thank God)and even at that short period, there's just not enough going on to fill up the time, so the camera follows people around in endless shots and repeats action from different people's perspectives. It may sound interesting, but watching the back of some guy as he trudges down endless hallways for about (literally) 10 minutes just doesn't entertain, provoke thought or provide any insight about this character I'm supposed to care about when he gets shot by another kid. It's a serious movie about an important topic and, in my opinion, does a great disservice to the kids and families who really went through an ordeal like this. The movie was definitely serious in tone but so boring and not captivating. Throughout the movie, Mike and I entertained ourselves by saying "You're the man now, dog" to each other (and to the cat... "you're the man now, cat") in crappy Scottish accents (well, mine was crappy) like skeevy Sean Connery. Not good at all.    On another, completely unrelated note, I went into CVS on my lunch break, and the craziest lady rang me up.  Here's a recap of the convo: Me: Hi. I'm going to get $20 cash back. Crazy: I have one of those Ion hair dryers. Me: Uh huh Crazy: Yeah, they keep the air clean. Clean air is sooo important.  Me: Uh huh Crazy: Even though I don't use it that much. Haha, this card with the shirtless bikers is funny (*It's for you, Shan BWAHAHAHA!).  Me: Yeah Crazy: Yeah, but I took a shower and washed my hair at 1:30 this morning and I thought it was never going to dry.  Me: Well, that's kind of late to be showering. Crazy: I had to take a shower because I had just been cleaning off my dog's rear end Me: Crazy: She's 14 and has really long hair and shit gets caught in it. She tried to lick it off, but she's 14 and not so limber. She's a schnauzer. Me: Uh.... Crazy: So after a few days, she really started so smell. I had to clean 'er off. The my husband said I smelled, so I told him he would too if he had just spent the last half hour cleaning a dog's ass. Sometimes she gets the runs and it's really bad Me: Sorry to hear about all that. Can you just put the receipt in the bag? Thanks.   Ha! I love how she went from hairdryers (unprovoked!) to her dog's irritable bowel in about 10 seconds. But it was pretty gross.

          In all my years of having people mispronounce my last name in Indiana, little did I know that some distant Tarbox relatives have been whooping it up on the East Coast.  Here are some things I have learned: 1.  There is a town in Massachusetts-a very small one-called Tarbox. 2.  There's another town in Rhode Island called Tarbox Corner. 3.  There is a Tarbox car dealership in Rhode Island (Toyota...I happen to own a Camry!).  It was quite a shock to my system the first time I saw the license plate "frame" with Tarbox in big block letters.  I'm just not used to seeing my last name anywhere other than in relation to me or someone in my immediate family.   4.  This is the best one of all.  There is a band called the Tarbox Ramblers from Cambridge, Mass that plays weekly at this bar in Cambridge.  Oh yes, I'll be checking them out.  I just checked out their website ( urlLink www.tarboxramblers.com ), and get this, they opened for Van Morrison when he was out here in April!  Holy mackerel, I waited too long to investigate this one...imagine me meeting Michael Tarbox at a Tarbox Ramblers show, getting friendly, and then him hooking me and Jon up with some sweet seats to the Tarbox Ramblers/Van Morrison show.  I'm not sure how much I'll dig the Ramblers-they're country/folksy-but how often do you see a band with your last name in the title?!  For me, this'll be a first.    P.S. I accidentally went to spell check just now instead of upload file, and it suggested I replace Tarbox with Throbs.  ???  Maybe it's not as popular as I thought!

         Okay.  Let's face it, I could pass for 16 at times.  I still get carded for cigarettes and even the occasional R-rated movie.  Most of the time this doesn't bother me, but when I'm hitting the town with Gracie (the 2 year old I take care of, pictured above), my youthful looks lead to lots of disapproving looks.  It's now easier for me to imagine what is would be like to be in a wheelchair and constantly have people looking at you and then either quickly looking the other way or giving a warm, supportive "wheelchairs are okay by me" smile.  I mostly get a more menacing, "the likes of you shouldn't be in THIS mall" kind of look from bitchy, Talbots-wearing, Audi station wagon-driving suburban moms.  Part of me wants to yell that I'm 23, she's not even mine, hey I'm studying for my PhD next year, and if she were mine, I'd be proud as hell and you can shove it up your ass!  Another part gets some satisfaction from how mad it makes these crazy women that I'd have the gall to have a baby.  Pop a Zanax, lady.    But the looks from these ladies aren't the worst part of shopping.  Abercrombie and Fitch has that covered.  I have this $75 gift card for that awful store that I received as a Christmas gift, and it's been a thorn in my side ever since.  Every time Grace and I go to the mall (and yes, I only go with Grace: she's a fantastic, opinionated shopping partner, and I'd never step foot in a mall around here on the weekend), I buck up and go into A&F in the hopes of using the gift card.  I hear the techno grooves thumping at least 8 stores away and usually cower in fear and run the other direction.  But a couple weeks ago, I forced myself to go in and picked up a couple "women's" shirts.  More like pre-pubescent shirts.  They seemed small, and no way was I trying them on, so I got larges and darted out of there.  I tried them on at home to find they ended a few inches shy of my belly button.  Hell no!  I may have rocked that look in high school and early college (I can't believe that!  Midriff-baring and bareback shirts?!  What was I thinking!!!), but I'm a little too old lady for that now.  Anyway, I exchanged those scraps of fabric today for a fairly normal button-down shirt for Jon as nothing in the women's department would cover my ass or belly.  The sales-wench kindly balled up Jon's shirt and thrust it into a naked-woman bag and requested an additional 72 cents as my gift card didn't cover the entire amount.  Ha!  At least I can rest easy knowing that I got what was mine from A&F (formerly known as Abercrombie and Snatch) back in the day.  In my opinion, A&F represents the worst of America (but the guy pictued below...not so bad).

Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Big Al and all. I really feel the love, but sometimes I catch myself doing the dorkiest things....and I have a hunch I'm not alone.   For instance, on my way to work today, I couldn't help but notice that I  1. Almost always have my hands at 10 and 2 on the steering wheel. Look out! New driver! 2. I also drink Slim Fast shakes for lunch almost every day (and they're not even doing anything for me!). I get bonus loser points for the insulated lunch bag I bring it in every day. It's lame.  3. I'm obsessed with Infotainment. Big time. When VH-1 or E has one of those Starrificcelebritylicioussuperfamewhoretastic hotttness countdowns, I get like a zombie in front of the TV. I also religously read page 6 of The Post every day, because if I don't know which Olsen twin is anorexic or if Lindsey Lohan's boobs are fake, my day feels hollow and empty.  4. When Mike and I do laundry, we like to kick back with a game of Scrabble. He's one of the few people who can beat me on a regular baisis, and that's a foundation of a strong relationship in my book. Even worse, for years, even before it was the mail terror tactic of choice, my goal each game was to spell out the word 'Anthrax.' I know, proper noun... 5. My filing system is so very. I just typed so very? Ok, make that number 6. For reals though, I have cable bills for the last three years, records of every oil change I've gotten, paychecks for my last three jobs. It's weird.   So I could go on and on, but looking up at those uh, "quirks" I realize that I'm turning into an old lady. And fast (you're on to something Jennie). And to think I didn't even get into my embroidered cardigan collection!   Let's hear some from you.

         Today I went to lunch with my eighteen year old cousin, Alison.  Now those of you who know her, know her and her escapades.  Those of you who don't, let's just say, her last day of school was last Friday and she was sent home for wearing a "provactive" outfit for senior dress up day.  Black eyeliner should just be tattooed on her eyes.  So today she expresses a deep need to chat with me....so off to the Bakehouse in Broad Ripple we go (yum yummy, btw).  After about 15 mins of mindless chatter, she pops the question "can you go to the BMV and get me a copy of your driver's license before I go to Florida; I lost my fake ID?". I politely explain that I have straight blondish hair in my pic, am wearing overalls, and it looks like I am missing a tooth...aka, we look nothing alike!  Then it occurs to me, what kind of prude am I being?  What's the worst that could happen?  It's confiscated and I just deny knowing her.  Why am I being so anal?  So I guess somewhere between turning 21 and graduating from college, I lost the screw the man attitude and gained the I can go to jail for that attitude.  Is this one more brick in the wall of becoming an adult?  Should I start buying things that beep, ring, and hum and hang out at Starbucks?

This is pretty much due to the fact that I drink tea, not coffee, and the only time I really want some is when I eat at a certain color-fantastic diner near my home. On occasion, I do stop in to a coffee shop with a friend to pick up a beverage or chat. But, this world is just not for me. My main question is, why do people feel the need to tote all their shit to a very loud, cramped location and attempt to "get some work done" or read a book? I, for one, cannot read a book with people breathing down my neck, frothing machines going like crazy, and various technological accessories beeping, ringing, and blaring every few moments. My theory is that doing this stuff in public, with designer coffee and all accessories on display, makes the customer think that he is actually doing something valuable and interesting rather instead of the regular humdrum homework, work-work, or personal interests. Now, because I spend a great portion of my day at home or at the library reading without coffee, piped in music, a dessert bar and the chance to impress other patrons or passers by with my ability to dress so well while "lounging" at the coffee shop, I can't totally understand what people get out of this. I honestly feel that it is just a "see and be seen" type of event for the public.   Even more stupid than the coffee shop: the Borders/Barnes and Noble Cafe as a place to break it down and "work". I was at a Borders Cafe with a friend last night and I seriously thought I was in the last circle of hell. I know I am anti social sometimes, but there was no way anyone was getting anything valuable done there, except projecting a certain self-image. I could have easily been at Target's Food Avenue or a gas station's snack area and achieved the same effect. Why do people feel the need to do this?

The authors' theory is that out of every great ensemble cast, one actor will be doomed to die, career-wise, with the show. They picked  Ian "Steve Sanders" Ziering as the unofficial mascot and noted:   "Why this unlucky person should be known as 'The Ziering' will be obvious to anyone who ever watched “Beverly Hills, 90210.”  Ian Ziering was, through its entire 10-season run, one of the show's stars breathing fratty, mulleted life into the character of Steve Sanders."    HAHA! Fratty, mulleted life! Pretty much after 90210, he's done nothing. Which stars of shows about to end will be Ziering-ing(?) in the near future? Use the handy-dandy chart provided to do some calculations. The authors of the article think Courtney Cox will be the Ziering from Friends, but my money is definitely on one of the guys. David Schwimmer, I'm looking at you.

Definitely an 80's rocker, or soft rocker... quickly my brain rattles through the card catalog of who it could be, after he talked to me in a slight British accent about how I was hardcore for getting the large sake.  I realized it was  urlLink John Waite , former member of "Bad English", who also had the solo hit "Missing You."  Seems he was still missing someone as he was sitting solo, doing shot after shot of sake, just sort of slumped in his chair watching "Elimidate" on the tv above the sushi bar.  He asked the sushi chefs to change the channel, only to find that they've got digital cable running through that bad boy, so we had to endure them flipping through and commmenting on 1000+ channels before they started making our dinner! In the middle of the sushi channel surfing, JW gets up and staggers off to the exit, only to leave us having to watch channels 659 - 1000 before getting our edamame.  After a few sips of sake, I didn't care, and I aint' missin' John at all.  I went to the movie premiere of " urlLink Saved !", a movie about teenagers at a Christian high school, and their struggles with their faith and one another.  It was hilarious in most parts, a little too sappy in others, but overall entertaining.  It doesn't paint the students as holier than though, but as conflicted, angry, and confused kids who just want to know what to believe in after years of being told what to believe.  Sitting in a three seat radius from me was Macaulay Culkin and his lady Mila Kunis, Wilmer Valderrama and Heather Matarrazo from Welcome to The Dollhouse.  Isn't there a six degrees of Heather in the Proximity family? She's trying to go blondish-red these days, and it aint workin.  Also nearby was Jena Malone and Eva Amurri, Susan Sarandon's daughter, who does a great performance in the movie, despite everyone saying she's got no talent and just a lot of connections.  Directly in front of me was Gloria Allread, the bigtime defense attorney, which I thought was odd.  I heard Michael Stipe, Adam Duritz, and the juggy and tan Lindsay Lohan were also in the house.  Ok, I'll stop.    The thing that got me, is that all of the unfamous people in the house were so stressed out and dressed to the nines, dying to be discovered by an agent or noticed by one of the actors.  This poor 18 year old boy was decked out in his best cocktail dress, pumps, and eyemakeup dying to make his runway debut, but no one except me and my friends noticed, and that's only getting him some blogsposure.  I was dressed very cazh, and was simply enjoying the free soda and popcorn they provide.  Everyone in there had some ulterior motive for being there, but I just wanted to see a free movie.

What do I see? Oprah dressed as a 17th century colonist (not on the weather station, of course.) So, I tune in and find out what she's sticking her fat ass in now. Much to my dismay, she is all over PBS's new series,  urlLink Colonial House , which starts tonight at 8pm. Why do I know this? Because I have been planning to watch it for months. Dork you say? Read on. Now, I am a little irate about this because, as many of you know, I have a very strong love for PBS, one of many reasons being that Oprah, Katie Couric, and Regis Philbin are NOT on that station! The programming is infinitely better than anything on network tv, although I do hate Nova (sorry Matt). Also, Matt and I have watched their "back in time" shows for a couple of years now, including Manor House, Pioneer Quest, and whatever the one was in the Victorian townhome. Was Oprah on those? No. Did anyone on network television care about them? Not as far as I could tell. Now all these O Magazine "live your best life" middle aged women are going to think that this is some kind of valuable experience they can bring to their families, which could be great. But, Oprah has such a janky perspective on things. She and her sidekick Gayle spend 2 days on the show (probably getting to sleep in their trailers) complaining about how gross and hard everything is in Colonial America. NO SHIT, gals! "You have to make your own food?... whine..."This bucket of water is really heavy"...whine..."These clothes are dirty!"...whine into camera for 5 minutes, etc., etc. And, after her visit, she basically concludes that colonial life is hard, but rewarding, and the people participating in the show were nice. So, everybody just stay safe in the world of Oprah's Favorite Things and the Book Club and let's just think everyone not living like crazed, overindulged consumers are cute, but kind of icky. Super. My beef (not Mr. Beef) is that some things should and need to remain seperate from the giant powers that be--Oprah, especially those that the American public salivate over and emulate constantly. So, I'm going to watch the show tonight, but if Oprah is on the series, PBS may be on its way out. I  hope not.

      Hi guys! its good to be bloggin again.  I was in new york for the last week doing stuff for the One Show festival and receiving my award.  We got the bronze pencil which was a bit dissapointing but honestly i can't be dissapointed as this is the highest honor one can receive at this stage in the career and even a bronze is way more than i had ever dreamed i'd get.  the portfolio review went well.  there were people from lots of agencies, mostly from new york that were all sitting at separate tables and you could go sit down and have them look through your book and give you advice.  all the advice pretty much cancelled each other out though which was kind of funny.  if one person had a favorite ad, it was another persons least favorite ad.  this just proves again that this is such a subjective business that i guess i should just stay my course and hope that someone wants to hire me in LA before i make massive changes to my book. one guy who i really admire actually said he "loved my book" which floored me.  So all in alll, it was an ego booster which i needed desparately.    Since john has been laid off (YEAH!!!!! severence pay and the whole summer before grad school, wedding, honeymoon, moving OFF!!) we are going to work on some more ads for my book together.  he is good at the computer and i have lots of ideas that need to be translated from paper to real ads.  He is also taking LOTS of picturs and im hoping hell set up a photo blog soon so you can see them.    So, I think ill go to the agency to get advice from my boss about how to proceed from here.  Ill also take my 2.5 years of work off their broke ass computers so i can have it all on my home computer and safe!  We're wrapping up all the wedding details slowly but surely and i cant believe its only like 3 weeks away!!! thats very exciting but nerve wracking as I feel like there are details im forgetting, but that's what i have a wedding coordinator for.  Thank god for her!!    ill blog something better soon once i get some shit done.  love ya ladies!

Since this is the first Friday Five, I thought I'd make it easy on all y'all. And since spring is here and summer is cooling its heels in the wings with a nice frosty beverage, it's time to let loose with our fave libations. Last night I walked through my first freshly mown lawn of the year and came home with grass clippings all over my toes. It was heaven. The kelly green looked quite nice with my pink toenail polish if I do say so myself. I  adore  watermelon colors together: pink, green and black.

By demand of those who are lucky enough not to know what a Longaberger basket is, please direct your attention to the photo at right. You know how bored suburban moms like to push junk on each other like it's crack? Consider Longabergers to be the purest form of sweet, sweet cocaine on the streets. It's expensive, addictive and extremely dangerous. Once you get just one little basket to organize your bills or store your collection of Family Circles, look out, because bears in American flag sweaters and wooden ducks with bonnets and aprons will soon be invading your home, and they're not Longaberger-induced hallucinations. Rehab is inevitable when you find yourself wandering around the Yankee Candle store in the nearest mall looking for the perfect olfactory confection to place in the middle of your ivory lace doily atop the antique Singer sewing machine (Cheryl really has this!) you use as an entryway table.  Tupperware, Amway, Avon and the Pampered Chef have nothing on this crap. At least you can use/eat some of that stuff. People pay crazy amounts of money for these baskets too. Most of the time, women buy them at "parties" hosted by "friends" or "coworkers", ahem, dealers is more like it,  but I looked on ebay, and a spread like the one pictured above is worth close to $300. There's even a single basket going for $600.  urlLink For serious .  Want to learn more about the pressure-cooker culture and effects these parties can have in your cul de sac, read  urlLink this article . Or check  urlLink this site  out. It was the first one to come up when I Googled "Longaberger Baskets suck."

       Wahoo!  I just registered for my fall classes for next semester.  I'm getting so excited...not for school, but for school supplies shopping!  Only partly kidding...that's obviously the best part of going to school.  Shan, you'll have to give me tips on any new must-haves for my educational needs (but you better not suggest one of those creepy baskets as a backpack alternative).  Anyway, these are the classes I'll be taking: Pro-Seminar in School Psychology, School Psych Ethics and Practice, Multiple Regression/Correlation Methods (ahh, stats...hope this teacher doesn't hate me like my last big witch of a stats teacher did...Jennie can vouch for that!), Theoretical Issues & Research in Human Development, and Applied Behavior Analyses.  I'll let any of you borrow the books when I'm done on these fascinating topics, just let me know.  I'll even tape-record the lectures for ya on topics of particular interest.  At any rate...the whole registering for classes thing makes going back to school feel so real and I'm so jazzed for that!!!  Best of all was looking at my schedule...my earliest day is an 8:30 on Wed.  But then that's before I get my internship so we'll see if this blissful-looking schedule lasts.  I don't mind doing a crapload of work as long as I can do it on my own time.  Ooh and I can't wait to start talking in terms of semesters and breaks again!  Yip yip ooooh yeah.

Look for it tomorrow. Not only is this a quiz about  urlLink which Golden Girl you are , it's an ode to you lovlies who make me smile every day. I'm miss spending time with each of you and just girls in general as I have no female frinds in Bloomington remaining (Janel the roommate moved back to Alaska and was replaced by Mike the boyfrind. Wonderful? Certainly. A girl? As much as he loves his toenails painted, still no.) It doesn't seem to matter, though. All the subsequent girls I've met don't stack up to a single one of you. (I might get a little misty on you here, so be warned) When I step back and look, really look, at each of you, I'm so proud that you've all grown up (and are still growing)into interesting, fascinating and beautiful women. I'm so proud I get to be friends with you all and I can't wait to see each of you again whenever that may be. Whenever I get down, I think about all of you, spread out all over the country living your lives, and I think, "If I'm smart enough to love these girls and they love me right back, I must be doing something right." You see, I just got to thinking about this when I was at a conference for work. The fellow attendees were mostly female, which is an anamoly at my office. I had dinner with a few of them one night and I just could not get into the conversation. We talked forever about the Friends finale and Ryan and Trista's wedding and Longaberger basket parties and I had no idea what what going on. I thought to myself, "Damn, I'm getting rusty with the girl conversation. I must be more out of it than I thought." Then it hit me, it wasn't me, it's them. I'm not like other girls, and neither are you guys. Sure there was nothing wrong with my dinner companions. They were nice as could be but there was something missing that you guys have. Whatever it is, never lose it and....thank you for being a friend   Ok, now that my very special Blossom moment is over, on to what you've all be waiting for.... I'm  the seductive over-sixty southern belle, Blanche Deveraux (haha! First comes Jackson, then comes Deveraux. Yay Adventures in Babysitting!) played by Rue Maclanahan. You are hot and you know it! Just be careful who you sleep with, and try to make it seem like you care next time one of your significant others passes away, unlike last time when you were getting a manicure, and you said you were getting your nails painted for the funeral. Of course I'm the whore.

We stayed in Arlington, Va., and lucky us, there was a Metro stop literally right outside the hotel doors. Even better, the hotel had a little shop where I could purchase and gorge myself on Toblerone every day. Anway, on Friday night, we went to the 9:30 club to check out Cursive (kind of emo-core music with an electric cello). They were playing as a part of the  urlLink Plea for Peace  tour, which combines music with voter registration tables and plenty o' Bush bashing. The music was decent (there were some other bands but our lazy asses didn't get there in time) but the show was highly entertaining. I mean, how many times do you see a rock band do a cover of Kelis' 'Milkshake' and let one of their hardcore fanboys sing the lead on the last song of the encore? Very cool. I'll let you in on a very embarrassing secret here....Sometimes I have this fantasy that I'm at a Death Cab show (or Postal Service; it doesn't matter), and Ben Gibbard points to me and asks me to come up on stage and sing backup for the rest of the show. I'm so great, the whole band loves me and they ask me to go on tour with them. Ok. Stop laughing now. Seriously! So on Sat. we did the tourist thing and took lots of snapshots at the Smithsonian/Lincoln Memorial/etc. Take a look at them  urlLink here . Most are courtesy of Mike except the ones of Chinatown I think. Thanks Macky!   That night, Mike called his friend Meghan who has lived in D.C., and she told us to head to Adam's Morgan for the bar scene where we went straight to a bar called Madam's Organ (get it? haha!). Actually, first we got some pizza slices that were seriously about as big as my torso. I could have worn the damn thing, but it was good I ate it because it helped soak up all the liquor I was about to consume. M.A. was a huge, multi-storied old bar with lots of cool nooks and crannies and an outdoor rooftop area. If you're from Bloomington, think Nick's but with more atmosphere. After a few hours of chilling in the lounge (with plush comfy couches), we headed down the street to Saki bar, where I bought two vodka redbulls for $24.00!!! Damn! It was a cool, kind of scene-y place. Mike spotted a guy wearing a t-shirt that said 'I'd fuck me' and complimented him on it (I got his business card. If you're interested in one of your very own, lemme know), so he invited us downstairs to hang out with, and I quote, 'the beautiful people'. It was kind of cheesy and minimalist at the same time, but they played some great songs like 'Poison' (Bel Bive Devoe–now you know), of course I had to get my groove on and try to dance on a table Hilton style. Unfortunately, a bouncer put a quick end to that. Fortunately, the guy sitting at the table had a bottle of Grey Goose and gave us some free drinks. Unfortunately, I had on a strapless dress, and I think it came down at one point *only for a second*...I mean, if I'm telling you embarrasing Death Cab fantasies, why not go all out, right?  The next day, we headed to the architecture museum (pretty empty but some cool plans from the NY Museum of Modern Art)and Chinatown then to Dupont Circle for dinner (beautiful area near all the embassies). Too bad the portrait gallery was closed! All in all a good weekend.  Mike left Mon. morning and I went to tons of conferences. One was a legislative breifing for the utitlities industry. Very interesting to me, and the gave us a handy booklet to see how all state reps. and congresspeople tend to vote on issues. Ok, this turned into a book, so I'll let you get on with your lives. All in all a good (but too short) trip. I love public transportation, so it was fun times.

She was virtually unknown to us youngins before then, as she was primarily a stage actress also in a handful of movies.  Now it seems she's got quite the huge head, and you can see it in the form of her contract shown at  urlLink The Smoking Gun.   She requires such things as $800 a week for her assistant, a stairmaster in her first class trailer, and freshly squeezed juice twice a day...um yeah, from my armpit!  The list goes on, and I urge you to peruse it, as it's a hoot.  Who do these people think they are?  I'm sure she wasn't always like this.  When exactly do people make the big change, when their quirks and likes go from being cute to annoying, odd, and just plain rude!  I'd like to think that I wouldn't have any crazy demands if I were a superstar, but maybe good ol' Diane thought that at one time too.  How much of this is Diane's demands and those of her manager, agent, lawyer, and husband?  It seems like the ones who are just below superstar status, are the ones who want the extra pampering.  What would you require in your deluxe trailer? Or would you just grin and bear it in the regular sized trailer the production company provided for you?

          There's no place like Boston for baseball.  If there's one place that can compete with Boston baseball, it's gotta be Chicago.  But I grew up going to Cubs games and maybe I wasn't old enough to appreciate the atmosphere then, but this just seems like another league (which is literally is, I guess).  Jon scored some awesome Red Sox tickets from work last night-7th row, between home plate and first base-and by the bottom of the 7th inning, we snuck into 2nd row (too bad I didn't have my camera).  My personal favorite players are Jason Varitek, the catcher, Johnny Damon, and of course Pedro Martinez, the pitcher who'll start nailing batters in the head (intentionally) when he gets pissed off.  But I think what really makes the game is the crowd...last night, some older guys start teaching this little boy (who they earlier spilled beer on) the "no batta no batta...swiiiiiiiiiiing" chant, a stunt that ended with the little boy (probably just shy of 7) yelling at the batter, "you SUCK!"  Then you've got the classy Boston accents all around, either ripping players to shreds or defending them ("I don't care what you say, he's got hahrt"...that's heart, by the way).  And when you leave you're bombarded with locals peddling t-shirts with slogans like "Anyone can have a bad century" (the seller of these shirts commented that if we'd get the Bambino up out his grave, he'd drill him in the ass) and "Jeter blows A-Rod" (those are a couple Yankees players).  Last year during the playoffs against New York, fans altered "Reverse Curve" road signs to say "Reverse the Curse."  Enthusiasm isn't exactly the word for the Boston crowd...maybe more like obsession.  But if nothing else, you've gotta admire them for never giving up on their team.

For a five dollar donation, I was able to sip on a Johnnie on the rocks and sample the yummy hors d'oeuvres in the 45 minute cocktail party.  Then, the official JW representative, donning an authentic kilt and Scottish outfit, rounded us all up to the seating area, where we had pretty little shots of brown drink waiting for us, along with some Walker schwag.  He tought us how scotch whisky is made, how to taste and find the different flavors such as smoke, vanilla, pear, and raisins, and by adding water to it, you release a lot of the great scents the scotch holds.    We only sampled 5 of the 40 whiskies that make up the 12-year-old drink, and boy was that enough.  The crowd started getting pretty rowdy at the end, but all in all it was a fun time.  I'm not much of a scotch drinker, but I'll definitely be more inclined to get one now, which was probably their whole ploy to bring in a potential younger generation of whisky drinkers......riiiiight.  Right now they're offering these events in L.A., San Francisco, and Dallas, but they're trying to line more up in a city near you.  I'll keep you posted.  Oh yes, the Warhol portion of this post.  I was able to check out an ongoing Annie Leibovitz exhibit also at the PDC after being ruddy faced from my Walker tasting.  It was an exhibit for  urlLink American Express ...so they had famous AMEX cardholders who've been photographed in the past by Leibovitz.  I finally got to see some of my favorite shots of hers up close and personal.  The exhibit runs through the end of June, so if you're in the area, definitely check it out.  Again, it's free!

Yeah you know me! In the last week, thousands of frosty television viewers have sent angry letters to the FCC based on a recent episode of Oprah in which she discussed  urlLink salad tossing and other explicit acts  on her afternoon talk show (topic: teens and sex). Here's the kicker: most people who have been writing in have done so at the urging of Howard Stern and Jimmy Kimmel and are disgusted at the FCC's double standard when it comes to censorship and regulation. The above link has copies of some of the letters and they're great. I especially love the first one about the viewer bringing home his/her 3 year-old twins from Bible camp and having to explain salad tossing. Ha!  You know what would be even better? Since the big O and the chairman of the FCC (Mike Powell, son of Colin...nepotism much?) are African Americans, I'd love to see Stern and Kimmel play the reverse race card.

        Now I know some of you ladies moonlight as a waitress/hostess or have at one point in time.  For those of you that went to college more than 100 miles away from your hometown and do not currently reside in said hometown, I doubt you frequently run into people you know from high school or college at your restaurant.  I do....and it sucks!  Last night I waited on Alex Yates, a fella I went to college with, and his family.  When the family asked how we know each other, he said from DePauw.  They hid their surprise and promptly asked me if I graduated!!  Pardon?  Did you say you wanted your ribeye in your lap?  Will do!  Here in lies the worst part of waiting tables, no matter where you work; your "guests" will often presume you are an idiot because you are waiting tables.  I have found this at PF Chang's and Sullivan's, so it is not the restaurant.  I also find myself eager to share that "YES, I did graduate!  Right now I have two jobs, one that serves my community, not my checking account, and one that takes your order...what do you want?".   I often find myself remembering that in New Zealand, I cleaned hotel bathrooms for a buck and no one flinched!  My flatmates did it, my friends did it; it was almost a right of passage into a new town.  So yeah, I will deal with John Selbourne, John Cavanaugh, and Alex and I will get all of the free steaks I want!

The dancers leapt and ran around a racetrack stage to new age music and revving engines and even crashed into each other from time to time. Apparently the choreographer was trying to take advantage of the big gathering of NASCAR fans in a nearby town. She said, "In this business, you're got to take chances."   I wonder if they handed out beer koozies at intermission.

The  urlLink article   is about how Arnold the wonderful governor of katies, and my soon to be state is suing an Ohio bobblehead company for using his likeness.  His likeness is owned by some production company but the bobblehead people argue that he is now a public political figure and can no longer control his image.  I fully agree.  Come on Arnold, you can't be a movie star and a governor at the same time.  Am I right?

      While shopping at Half Price Books this weekend, it occured to me that there are certain constants, or givens, in this world.  As dear old Cathedral football coach, Rick Streiff would put it, "all you gotta do is stay white and die".  I would add get a job, but that's me.  In the world of used music, I have found that there are always certain cds that flood the used cd racks.  It seems that no matter what store, in what city, in what country I go to, I will always find these cds.     Anything by Belly, usually King, but sometimes Star.     Not that Bush is my fave band, but this album must be their worst!     Usually there is a selection by Madonna, and I would venture to say that this one gets resold the most.     I KNOW you have all seen this while searching for Republica or some other band that begins with R.     Perhaps this was right next to the 50 copies of "One Hot Minute".   What is some of the junk you always have to sift through when used cd shopping?

Since we're all still at the age when the question "what are your (life) plans?" is applicable, I have been bombarded with that one lately. When I say, "almost done with school; need to look for jobs; get married; have a panic attack, etc;" women squeal: "Pretty soon you'll be a Mrs.!!!" Then, I either punch them in the face or vomit all over their soccer mom outfits.  Now, ok. Technically, I will be a Mrs., I suppose. I just don't think of myself that way. I'm Shannon. Shan. Booty. ShanDog. Boots. Booty Coogan. Natalie! Did it ever occur to anyone that I really could give a shit at this point in my young life if anyone knows I am a Mrs.? NO. Of course, I don't take marriage lightly and I have no problem with being married, but, if all these morons are going to go around calling me Mrs. Hautman because it's cute, I don't think I can handle that. And, I'm not even getting into the whole name change aspect, because I can't make up my freakin' mind about that. It's just crazy how much of a novelty being a Mrs. is... It's like a weird remnant of the 1950's "now your life can really begin because you are married" crap.   Bottom line: Nobody ever spazzes out about the MA; just the MRS. So, ladies, choose your titles wisely.

         It's time for me to let the cat out of the bag.  I've been hiding out in Boston all this time because...Jon and I have a child.  That's right, a child.  His name is Dinh Van Tuan, he's 7 years old, and he lives in Vietnam.  How does all this add up, you're wondering?  Well, we adopted him through an organization called Pearl S. Buck several months ago, and it's been a really cool thing to do.  So I wanted to suggest it to any of you who may have a little extra cash floating around (it's $25 a month).  You can either adopt a child (that's what we're doing-you give your $25 a month and also exchange letters with your adopted child; with Pearl S. Buck, the average length of a sponsorship is ~13 years, and lots of sponsors end up visiting their child at some point), become a CHAMPion for a child (which I just learned they prefer; you still give your $25 a month, but you don't get individual letters from the child, nor do you write them...this saves money on translation and postage), or of course you can just donate some money if you don't want the monthly commitment.  If you're interested in checking this out, go to  urlLink Pearl S. Buck's website .

       Hey ladies!  It's been awhile...and now I'm happy to say I'm back in Indianapolis to kick it for awhile before moving to Arizona.  Jennie and I had a great time in NYC getting what's ours (we didn't pay for parking once, very thrifty girls!!!) and then some more good times at the New Zealand reunion in New Hampshire.  But then Jennie left around 6 on Sunday and that's when the real fun of packing/cleaning the apt. started.  What a pain in the ass!!!!!!!!!!!  I never think things are going to take as long as they are.  It doesn't help that I tend to be a schizophrenic packer, darting around the apt. doing little things here and there instead of focusing on one thing.  Here are some of the highlights of packing: 1.  We didn't take the couch and wanted to donate it and have it picked up, but you have to organize that jazz a couple months in advance! (oops!)  So we pushed the couch out onto our sidewalk Sunday night, and it was gone Monday morning!  That's when we first realized that the people living around us are hip to snatching random goods from the trash (which I applaud...I'd much rather have someone use it then throw it out).  Other things that were taken: a bureau, a mattress, a magazine rack, a SpongeBob trashcan, a lamp... 2.  We were in the midst of moving our desk when we realized it wasn't exactly holding up (it was a $40 purchase from the Christmas Tree Shop), so we kicked that to the curb, and yes, it was taken. 3.  We had to tie the mattress to the top of an SUV to move it to the storage place.  The first time around, our tying job wasn't adequate and a few minutes into the drive, I look up and yell "The mattress is gone!"  Luckily for us, it hadn't fallen off completely, just flipped backwards.   That's enough reliving the move for now.  It's too soon to go into more detail...I may start having flashbacks!  Now I am on my way to see a baby miniature horse (yes, there is such thing as a miniature horse...those are the size of a large dog...so imagine what a baby mini will look like!) at the stable my sister works at.  Pictures will follow!

      Hi Ladies The next time I post it may be from the city of light! Since we have just switched realtors in an effort to get our house sold faster we are going to be trying to check email every other day while in France.  So, I figure that I'll be able to post a few times and let you know what we're up to.  Whether I can read the blog is another story as it sometimes doesn't like to load on slow connections and computers.  Anyway, we are leaving tomorrow around 3:30pm here to go to the airport so I'll be doing a little blogging and emailing in the morning if anyone cares to comment on this post.  I'm posting my packing.  Here is what I'll be reading while on my honeymoon.  I may catch something else at the airport as im known to buy a book when I have three others with me that I haven't even started.  I think Jennie's book recommendation post "Sex Drugs and Cocoa Puffs" might be too hard to resist if I see it at the airport bookstore...we'll see!     Sarah Vowell is a regular contributor to This American Life and like Sedaris has a voice that is unforgettable and I assume it'll be impossible to not read the book with her voice in my head.  But thats a good thing I guess; it's more personal.  This book (The Partly Cloudy Patriot) is her first (she has a second that came out last year) and is a collection of short stories and essays etc.       Another proximity recommendation and a book that I've eyed at the bookstore probably since its publication but never purchased.  Now I have!     Subtitled: The Paris Review Book for Planes, Trains, Elevators, and Waiting Rooms. The description on amazon says: It's theme is the reader. Everyday we must live through moments of waiting--to get from one place to the next, from one appointment to another, for something to happen. This ingeniously useful compendium offers reading material to fill those gray moments with beauty, wonder, insight, and emotion. Organized by the time that the reader has available at that moment, the anthology provides a poem for that elevator ride to the lawyer's office; a short story for the thirty-minute commute; a novella for the three-hour plane ride. As ever, The Paris Review provides work from only the best writers of the last three generations.     Lastly, a new blank journal to write in.  It's small and grey with a little pocket in the front to put a picture in.  I have a picture of the empty Sears store at night focused in on the lone escalator.  John and I went to the abandoned mall a few block from our apartment and took pics at night as the empty stores inside are all lit up.  We both have an obsession with old department stores etc; so called suburban ruins.  I typically can't write in a journal so small but this will fit so nicely in my purse I had to have it.    A la prochaine.....

      It's quite lovely to be back to the Prox after a wee hiatus!  I had such fun with Jenny in NYC and my fine flatmates(minus one) in the Hampshire.  So many stories, such little time!  I will be sure to post a link to my pics once I get them uploaded (as well as the pics from The Stills show a loooong time ago).    I must mention the funniest night we had in NYC and that was the night of the Keane (pronounced Keen) show.  We came to find out that it was sold out, but the door guy mentioned a slight chance of some tiks being available come showtime.  So we kicked it in the barski, waiting for some news.  In the mean time, this fella perched on a stool and started strumming his guitar...but the shocking part was his voice.  Seriously, he sounded like Joni Mitchell, enough that I looked around to see where the gal with the microphone was!  I missed the first ditty, but Jenny said that the refrain was a repetition of "tiny" sung like "tiiiiiny, tinnnnyyyyy".  Hee hee, so we started singing "hold me closer tiny eunuch!" We ended up getting into the Keane show for free and it was sweet, but not as enjoyable as tiny eunuch.  Oh yes, and Jenny and I had a thought.  Now I know most of us read  urlLink 1.21 Gigs  on occasion and one predominant theme (aside from musical thoughts and whinings and the occasional political piece) is the use of vulgar nicknames!  Seriously, they can refer to one another as shit stain and dildo and everyone seems to know the suspect in question by that nickname.   Perhaps Proximity can trump them with vulgar nicknames of our own.....?   Finally, this book called  urlLink Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs  by Chuck Klosterman looks hilarious!  He is apparently a senior writer or editor for Spin Mag and this is his second novel.  I read the exerpt on borders.com and laughed about his emo bit!  Teddy would be a fan....he talks about how there is no true love in the world anymore because of Coldplay and John Cusack.  Very funny and it could be next on my reading list.

Now I love a good frank just as much if not more than the next guy, but loving them for their girth is not one of those reasons. In his ad report card,Seth Stevenson examines Ball Park Franks  urlLink ad that makes you go ewww , this one featuring a man who goes on and on about his hot dog having "great girth" and then moaning orgasmically.  urlLink Watch it here . Girth, a term usually reserved for below the belt comments. Hot dogs use a lot of shady meat, but that's a little gross.  Now it's kind of unspoken common knowledge that hot dogs are sort of phallic....wieners, anyone? But why would an advertising co. decide to highlight that in a spot that centers on a clearly ultra-straight dad type having an all-American cookout? Ignorance? Subversion? Shhh, no one tell the FCC!

       I read  urlLink this article  on Salon this morning and it really just struck a chord in me.  Why has middle america, the blue collar workers, the farmers etc gone republican when none of the policies they help the bastards enact benefit them in any way?  In the article he says:   "Nobody thinks it's strange that Nebraska and Nevada and Arizona and Montana vote for right-wing Republicans in election after election, consumed with tax-cutting fervor and a passion to shrink the government, even though it's the massive federal programs of the 20th century -- dams and aqueducts, agricultural subsidies, public lands thrown open to ranching and mining and lumbering -- that supports those states' economies to this day."  Middle america is so jaded to the politics of economics (and rightfully so) that they base their decisions soley on cultural issues.  Anti-abortion, anti-evolution and the like.  And the republicans are slimey and perceptive and they mobilize the masses on these issues.  It's easy to point the finger at republicans but the article also takes aim at the Democratic party for its part in this debaucle:  "There are two different errors that were made, and both of them have amounted to jettisoning the working class, so that the working class is no longer the central focus of the party. In the McGovern era they described this as the "new politics." The error of that was apparent at the time, because McGovern went down in flames. The idea was, we'll build a new coalition around students, feminists, environmentalists and so on."  The author mentions that both John Edwards and Howard Dean talked old-school populist politics early in this election and now John Kerry attempts to echo them but seems insincere.  I will vote for Kerry of course.  I have no choice.  I want someone other than Bush in the white house.  But I still have the Howard Dean sticker in the back window of my car.  Lots of people have told me to give it up; take it down.  I was lazy at first but finally I tried and found that the tape I used had melted to the window or something.  I can't get it off.  But maybe that's a good thing.

Taking up the challenge  urlLink this guy  sent out to all the ladies in the hizzouse seems as good as anything I can think up. He and his friend created a 10-point scale to determine a girl's hotness regardless of personal "types" anyone might have.   Here are my criteria in ranking guys. I do have to preface this by noting that a hot (or not) guy is perceived as such based a lot on context. There are certain places like the  urlLink National Firearms Museum  where my liberal ass probably wouldn't be attracted to Jake Gyllenhaal if he were there lovingly fondling a pistol. On the other hand, any guy trying to win the  urlLink Party with Reno 911  sweepstakes would automatically win a piece of my heart regardless of looks etc. That being said, on with the show....  1. Face gets you 2 points 2. Hair 1 point 3. Personal style and flair (15 pieces minimum) 3 points 4. Company he keeps*(again, context) 2 points 5. Body 2 points *If you like a guy, life is so much easier when you like his friends. And I'm a strong believer that the people you hang out with say more about you that any physical trait. 2 points if he's alone, because that's cool.    X factors: These would be based on less superficial first-impression traits that could add or take away from the original score.  1 point for good shoes. Fun,individualistic footwear is key and I know I'm not alone on this. 2 points for sense of humor 3 for the holy trifecta of good taste in music, movies and most of all books (TM  urlLink Byron )  Conversely, I would be down with subtracting points for lacking the above factors. Also worth a -1 is being too married to a subculture (ie: fratty, raging hippy, hipster/scenester to a fault, faux thuggish, straight edge) I can't have a guy who is always costumed and can't run to the grocery store in basketball shorts and the Captain Morgan t-shirt he got free at a bar 4 years ago....  Damn, I sound PICKY! What makes your scale? Check out another girl's take on the question  urlLink here .

This repeal could also allow shelters to kill smaller pets like parakeets and hamsters immediately!  Nooooo!  While I currently don't own any pets of my own, this still saddens and angers me, as our little pet friends deserve a chance to find a nice home.  I have a hard time swallowing the "we'll save the government $14 million dollars, but we won't save lives" bit, when this won't solve the problem.  How about hiking up taxes even the tiniest bit to start a state or nationwide spay/neuter program.  What do you all think?

       John sometimes does because I like caffeine a little too much.  In fact I'm typing this post at about 300 wpm.  These pots are so awesome.  I got one for my wedding (when I returned a few towels!) because I love espresso and have been looking for a way to make it at home that doesn't require a really expensive machine.  These things make espresso better than I've tasted at many coffee shops and for about 1/8 of the price of a home machine.  I drink it in the new espresso demitasse and saucer that I got at Crate and Barrel or use one shot of espresso and one shot of vanilla soymilk (heated in a pan on the stove until it foams) in a coffee cup and saucer.  It is simply divine.  I highly recommend it to anyone that likes espresso.  It's so cheap to drink at home instead of spending like 3 dollars on an espresso drink at a coffee place.   urlLink Here  is a place online to get them.

How does something as simple as a word become an inside joke? What about jokes a whole generation is in on?  urlLink This article  attempts to pick out the comedians, jokes and moments that have defined recent humor, citing such luminaries as Bill Cosby, Michael Moore and Sara Silverman. It's not so much about the individuals as it is what they said or did at a given moment in time that changed the face of comedy. Reading some of these, like their mention of the Onion's September 11 coverage, had me nodding in recognition, but on the other hand, I've never been a huge David Eggers fan, so seeing his book on the list didn't do much for me.

         Hey laaaaaadies!  Welp, I about to leave for Beantown, known to the outer world as Boston, to visit Ms. Box for her birthday.  So jazzed, so jazzed...but I wanted to leave you with a wee post about this amazing band called Keane.  They are a fine British find and actually, Steve posted about this band on 1.21 Gigs last week.  According to Spin, they have held the #1 spot in the UK for a few weeks since the the release of  urlLink Hopes and Fears  , their first album (I believe).  Anyway, these guys are a must for your collection, sounding a bit like Travis, Coldplay, and one critic said Radiohead in the Kid A days.  Jen and I are going to check them out in NYC at the Knitting Factory on Thursday, so a review will be in order.  In the mean time, Target is selling this gem for $8.99, a steal if I've ever seen one.  Lata!

While I'm disappointed, I shouldn't be surprised. It seems like every awesome show I'm all set to hit goes up in spectacular flames. I bet if I wasn't planning to attend this show, it would be all systems go. In the article, Perry Farrell muses on some of the reasons tickets might not be selling and cited high Ticktmaster fees as a possibility. Um, you think? As disappointed as I am that the show will not go on, I have to respect all those out there boycotting Ticketmaster's lameness. Oh, well. There's always  urlLink Curiosa , featuring the Cure, Interpol, the Rapture and Mogwai.   In other news, the  urlLink director's cut  of Donnie Darko looks promising. I can't wait to get skeeved out by Frank the rabbit all over again. Related (sort of), I had a scary/touching dream last night that the American population was being terrorized by evil bowling pins but I found two that were still good and I rescued them from a lab where they were being tested to find out why the pins had become rabid. We (being the two good pins and I) made a hasty getaway in an old VW Beetle. I haven't been bowling in months, so the only explanation I have for this is those damn videos they show at the alley each time you take your turn. You know how they have the ball as a sheriff snoozing on the job and the pins sneak out of jail if you don't knock them down in real life? No? Well, they do have that video is all I'm saying....  This just in, I finally have all of the ladies' song selections and I'll make the CD as soon as possible so you get it while it's actually still summer!

         Coffee and Cigarettes was perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life.  So annoying and boring that it actually made me angry.  I spent the whole movie just boiling for it to be over.  Some of the user reviews on IMDB put it perfectly:  Summary: boredom disguised as art      if you can't write clever dialogue but only meaningless and boring droning from empty people, then dress it up as an art film, maybe no one will notice or, better still, they'll read some "cool" cachet into the dreck that will give it meaning. there is simply not one person in this film that you would listen to for more than 40 seconds if you were trapped bedside them in a bar.do we need a film on the emptiness of human communication when we can experience it firsthand everyday? so why pay money for it? I would see only if they paid a standard therapy fee to me ( about $135.00 per hour).Jim Jarmisch should have quit after Down by Law, his only good film. Quentin Tarantino, pay attention, here lies your future and it ain't pretty.   Summary: Throw away your time and money here!      Don't you wish that every time you scribbled with a crayon on a piece of paper that you could pick it up, hang it in a museum, and people would pay to see it? That's kind of what this film is like. Don't you think it's great that Jim Jarmusch has cool friends like Tom Waits and Cate Blanchett? So do I. But do I need to pay $10 to see Jim's cool friends ramble their insipid thoughts in pretentious and moronic vignettes? Well, obviously I do, because I did. But I'm really glad I did, because now I know for sure: Jim Jarmusch has REALLY COOL friends. That is about the sum total of what I came away from this movie with.      The vignettes vary from the medium-okay to the suicide-inducing. The worst one is the first one, with Stephen Wright and Roberto Begnini. The best one (and the only one featuring anything approaching a performance) is Cate Blanchett's conversation with herself. It's not that great, but at least you're watching some talent, and not JJ's cool friends just be themselves with the assurance that THAT IS ENOUGH. The other bearable one features Alfred Molina and Jim Coogan, but even this is a one-sentence joke stretched out to five minutes. The White Stripes, Pop/Waits, RZA/GZA/Bill Murray, and a number of others that I have already completely forgotten, are not worth watching. Unless of course, you are one of JJ's cool friends, or aspire to be. Or maybe if you're his mother.      If you do end up going, please note that the opening credits represent the order that the "personalities" (can't really describe them as actors in this case) appear. This will prove an invaluable guide to how much longer you're going to have to sit through this crap.      Be sure to keep an ear open for the world's longest version of "Crimson & Clover."   Summary: Worthless, pretentious, and over-rated      Coffee and Cigarettes was worthless, which is why I'm glad someone else paid for me to see it. If you actually liked this movie, I would love to talk to you, because you are just kidding yourself. You think it's cool to like movies that you don't understand, when really you don't understand them because they are crap and there's nothing there to understand.  The  urlLink New York Times  however gave this movie an "A" according it Yahoo movies.  Wow NY Times, you're a real bunch of fuckin losers.

I was exiting the train station to hit up some shopping on Michigan Avenue and right before my eyes are Grimace, Birdy, The Hamburgler, and Ronald McDonald all in costume. They were celebrating the re-opening of what used to be a very scary McD's on State Street, and the press, aldermen and all kinds of important folks were there. The friendly Grimace was walking around patting people on the head and looking very jazzed about life. I enjoyed hanging out with him for a bit whilst the festivities took place. I was saddened to learn that Mayor McCheese is no longer around to police the hungry crowds. We seriously could have used someone to keep Ronald under control, because he was a little too friendly with me and my friend. I love  urlLink this guy's blog entry on Grimace  and his function in the world of McDonald's. Even better- his blog is entitled  Here's My Beef .

         Shannon's post about feminism intrigued me and recently I have been rather creative and began working on a new collage and taking some abstract photos (I also took six rolls of B&W film from who knows when to be developed, can't wait to see what comes out!).  So I wanted to share with you one of my fave photographers,  urlLink Nan Goldin .  She is amazing and her work has been grouped with Cindy Sherman, Diane Arbus, and Barbara Krueger.  She began taking pics after her sister died tragically when she was 16 so that she could have a photographic memory of her friends, experiences, relationships etc., a documentation of her life.  All of her images are in color and often use what some believe is a "harsh" light with a flash, but I find the flash quite complementary to the image, not distracting.  She came about in the 70s and has been an active photographer ever since, documenting her violent relationship with her boyfriend, the 80s club scene, and the beginning of the AIDS epidemic that has claimed the lives of many of her friends.  This is what I consider her most poignant and universal work.  A show I saw of hers in NYC contained a 16 photo or so sequence that begins with her friend and his boyfriend, their happier times together, and follows the both of them through her friends eventual death, concluding with his empty hospital bed surrounded by all of the cards, balloons, etc that decorated his room.  You can read more in the article I linked to!

         I love games, plain and simple....board games, game shows, sporting games, card games, mind games :), you name it.  Surprisingly, I don't find myself too competitive and hopefully you guys don't view me as that either, I just love to play games.  The good old days of Scattergories at Dave Roger's house still ring clear in my memory.    Now for the reason for my post:  This week, and actually last week, on Jeopardy, this guy, Ken Jennings, has won a record 11 times (since they got rid of the five wins and you're out rule last year) and made over $350,000!!  This is an accomplishment as far as I can see.  While I love trivia, there are always those categories that I have a snowball's chance in hell with and if the whole board is filled with such categories, I am bummed.  But this guy is swift with the clicker and actually knows most of the answers....his guesses are also usually right.  So I give mad props to Ken for his knowledge, speed, and cash flow, as well as for finding a different way to present his name on his booth for the last 11 days.

I am always on the lookout for a funny restaurant and today I may have found some contenders for MR. BEEF. While tooling about in the Plymouth Breeze, I saw Al's Fun in the Bun, a hot dog establishment complete with dancing dogs. I was euphoric. Then, a few miles later, I ran across Bunny Hutch, which had statues of rabbits in suspenders and bow ties doing a jig outside the doors. I've also come to notice that the best places always serve hot dogs burgers, fries, beef, broiled chicken, and various other fast food items. Man, I better restrain myself from trying the cuisine at these fine establishments. I think I need to start carrying the camera so we can get a gallery of my dancing food characters.  I think this all stems from staying at a hotel in Disney World with my parents. I don't know what theme our hotel had, but we had pictures of hamburgers and milk shakes on the walls. I also remember a Hamburgler in the lobby or something. I guess it was a McDonald's hotel!

He's just about the same age as those who read and contribute to this site and he looks back a high school, which seems so recent, with quite a bit of distance. When I think about it, high school really was a long time ago. More than half a decade. And while I've changed considerably (as I imagine most people would), it seems kids and even society in general has gone through a significant metamorphosis. In the article (read  urlLink part 2  here), the author and his 17-year old date discuss current high school trends such as 16-year-old girls dating men in their 30s and high schoolers having anal sex, things that just a few short years ago were at least sort of taboo at my school. And it's not just the teenagers,the adults encourage such adult sexual behavior by objectifying the youngest girls possible. The article brings up the point that, several years ago, Cindy Crawford at age 30 was the object of lust for most high school boys. These days, 30 seems anicent and boys and even grown men drool over the likes of Hilary Duff, Lindsay Lohan and the Olsen twins, girls so young, they still tote around fake ids.  It's an odd sensation to be in my early twenties and feel over the hill. Isn't now our prime and not when we were 17 and awkward? Living in a college town, this point is magnafied when I'm surrounded by girls aged 18-22 and wondering if we have anything in common. I think about underwear and wonder if the thong I'm wearing that was so scandalously normal three years ago is now today's grannie panties.

      The 11 year old girl I take care of has this shocking t-shirt that I had to post about.  It's from Hollister (think Abercrombie and Fitch), and there's a picture of a cow on the front of it.  Above the cow, it says "Why buy the cow?" and then there's a bubble coming from the cow's mouth that says "The milk is free!"  Inappropriate much?  Now Maggie does have an obsession with cows, but still.  No kid of mine would ever don that shirt!  It's not like it's a hip new saying that her parents may not know the meaning of; it's common knowledge.  It's like wearing a t-shirt that says, "Hey!  I'm slutty and like to hook up with no worries of commitment!  Anyone interested?"  I tried to find a picture on their website, but there wasn't one...maybe it's been discontinued due to disgruntled consumers like me.

In the mid 70's, a female college student formed a chorus for feminists and/or lesbians and it was the first of its kind. The group developed from a random cross-section of women to a very talented, award winning chorus. I found this so interesting because of the stories behind the women's choice to become involved in the choir. Most interesting, several heterosexual members described the experience of being identified as lesbian because they were part of a group that self-identified as lesbian and/or feminist. Their music was really beautiful, and it spanned the musical genres from traditional hymns to "god is a womyn" stuff.   What I found to be really enlightening here is a concept that I have been thinking about for quite some time, and I think this is really problematized by cultural conception. The choir's inclusion of both hetero and homo women clearly placed the notion that the term "feminist" has quite an individual meaning for each woman, and the idea that feminists are one kind of person with one set of values is really an outdated label attributed to first wave feminism and gross socio-cultural misconception. It seems to me that we can all agree that there is a very base definition of feminism, one that argues for the equality and empowerment of women. But, then you have some camps that argue that feminism can succeed only with solidarity among the male sex, and others who argue that the inclusion and involvement of men is destructive to the whole notion of feminism, and so on into infinity. I have always resisted the label of feminist, although I share many ideals presented by feminist authors and activists, because I really reject the inevitable and often uninformed labeling that goes along with such a term. Meaning, if I say I am a feminist, does that mean that I want Bush out of office? (I do want him gone, by the way). I know some feminists who are Republican-- this seems paradoxical--but the truth is that our modern world has bred so many different types of feminist thought that a blanket (negative) label is just plain ineffective. I really enjoyed this documentary because it did help me think about some of this jazz, and although I'm still no clearer on whether or not I want to be known or identified as a feminist, I was glad to see that for many years women of various belief systems and sexual orientations have been creating positive energy with their passion for music, therefore presenting the idea of feminism and a feminist woman as something that is no longer static and stereotypical. Basically, getting to see the people react to the label of feminism and wanting to transcend that through music was pretty powerful.   How do you as a person and the term "feminist" get along? I'd love some comments.

      Guys, I almost hate to do this to you, but I couldn't pass this up.  My Grandpa sent me this forward which is apparently floating amongst the Republican-minded, Bush-loving members of the population.  I always wondered what their mass e-mails and e-mail distribution letters look like, and now I know.  And what a load of crap it is.  Anything that starts off with a kid hesitant to miss school is obviously the beginning of a tall tale.  And frankly I don't find the picture below to be endearing, I find it frightening.  Take a gander for yourselves...     Editorial by CK Rairden May 10, 2004  It started out as a fluke.  Lynn Faulkner had been offered an extra ticket to a Bush campaign event by his neighbor Linda Prince.  Mr. Faulkner decided to offer it to his 15-year old daughter Ashley who he expected would decline, as she would have to miss some school to attend.  But his daughter surprised him.  Ashley reminded her dad how four years ago they attended a similar event when then Texas Governor George W. Bush visited the same spot on the campaign trail.  Ashley remembered attending that event with both her father and her mother Wendy Faulkner.  It was raining that day and they all stood in the rain awaiting Governor Bush "eating Triscuit crackers" enjoying the time together and hoping to get a glimpse of the would-be president.  Ashley recalled holding her mothers hand as they waited. So she decided to go again this year, but this time her mother could not attend.  Wendy Faulkner was murdered on 9/11/01 in the south tower of the World Trade Center.  She was there on the 104th floor for a one-day meeting.  Ashley decided to miss school in honor and remembrance of her mother and attend the event.  So the trip was on.  Linda Prince, along with Lynn and Ashley Faulkner, were off to the Golden Lamb Inn in Lebanon, Ohio for the event.  The group arrived early and got a spot close to the front.  As the event wound down, the president worked the line in full campaign mode shaking hands and signing autographs.  As the president passed the group, Mr. Faulkner got an autograph, and the president continued on until Linda Prince spoke up, "This girl lost her mother on 9/11," Prince told the president.    Then everything changed.  "The president's entire _expression transformed," Mr. Faulkner told me on Sunday.  "He turned and came back against the flow and his eyes locked on Ashley's.  His face showed a man who was no longer the president, he was a father and a husband."  President Bush made his way back to Ashley and he embraced the 15-yeal old young woman.  "She snuggled in with the president just like she did when she was a little girl with her dad," Mr. Faulkner said.  "I know it's hard," Mr. Faulkner heard the president tell his daughter.  "I'm okay," Ashley told the president.  The embrace continued.  Mr. Faulkner had his Kodak digital camera with him and debated on invading this very private moment between his daughter and the leader of the free world.  "For 20-30 seconds the president belonged exclusively to Ashley," Lynn Faulkner told me.  So he decided to capture the moment without invading Ashley and the president's privacy.  He held up his digital camera, not even aiming with his eye and with one click snapped just one picture.  It showed in detail the face of a compassionate man who just happens to be the president comforting a young woman who lost her mother in the 9/11 attacks on America.  Mr. Faulkner told me that he saw tears in his daughter's eyes, and saw emotion that he hadn't seen from his daughter in 2 ½ years.  Ashley told her dad, "The way he was holding me, with my head against his chest, it felt like he was trying to protect me, he wanted to make sure that I was safe."  That feeling is captured in a very clear way in this moving unscripted photo.  It's the only photo of this special embrace as the press corps had already been ushered back on the bus.  And the photo was never meant for publication.  All Mr. Faulkner did when he returned home from the event was e-mail it to 15 friends and family.  But by the middle of last week, I had received the photo from eight different people.  Others were also receiving the photo and forwarding it along.  It became an Internet phenomenon, as it was e-mailed around America.  Mr. Faulkner called the embrace "President Bush's precious gift to my daughter."  And with his small act of e-mailing that photo to friends and family, the picture can now become a gift to the American people.   And as sad as the story is the release and publication is a good thing.  Disgusting photos coming out of Iraq for the past 10 days have shocked Americans, as they should have.  But no longer are the terrible images of 9/11 shown.  While the Iraq prison photos have been picked up by the elite media and shown time and again, this touching photo has gone largely ignored by the mainstream media.  But the alternative media has made this touching powerful photo one of the most e-mailed photos of last week.  The Internet once again took over where the elite media failed.  Matt Drudge ran it on May 7th, as did the Page 2 Politics journal, and hundreds of other blogs.  Millions have now seen it, but millions more need to.  It gives a stark reminder why America is at war with radical Islam and other terrorists around the world that are determined to cause this kind of pain to other American families.   The images of 9/11 have faded in the minds of far too many Americans.  This picture and this family's riveting story give a stark reminder of why America is at war.  Each day around the globe our soldiers are fighting in an attempt to prevent any other event as terrible as the murders that took place on 9/11.  Look hard at this picture.  See the compassion and sadness on the president's face.  Look at this young woman, see her grief and listen her father's words.  Ashley and her sister Loren just spent their third Mother's Day without their mother, as did thousands of other children who lost their mothers on 9/11 at the hands of ruthless uncaring terrorists.  Imagine yourself in that position.  Then remember why America is at war, and consider the type of person America should have leading that war.

So hilarious! Check out the three rays of light shooting out of the cat's head! This is Otis, my petit and feeble cat. At the request of Leah, I've included a picture of him that shows how junior-sized he really is (and proves he's really not an evil posessed demon). As you can see, Otis measures in at eight cans of Friskee's cat food tall. What a champ. It's great having a midget cat. He doesn't jump on the counters, (I think he's too scared,poor fella)  his cute mini size makes his green and white gingham bowtie extra snazzy and he fits nicely in my arms when we spoon at night. Here's a link to  urlLink more pictures  of Mr. Junior. You can see how he compares to one of my size 7.5 flip flops, and  even though he's small, don't think he doesn't  rock the white patches on the back legs that make him look like he has on hooker boots! Also, here are a few shots of  urlLink Leah's weddin' . I felt like I took more pictures but maybe not.

         This is a pic of what I just had for lunch, a vegetarian naked burrito from Qdoba.  Yes, I am posting about my love for  urlLink Qdoba Mexican Grill  and I am not ashamed.  When they offered a card where you buy 10 burritos or entrees and receive the 11th free, I picked up five because I knew I would use them all up in about a month.     I found this pic of a burrito eating contest and it made me laugh!  You KNOW I would have won (unless Tarbox was in the competition, then it would have been tough to call!)! While in NZ, Jenny and I would have conversations recalling this one time, when we went to Qdoba (since Mexican food is a delicacy there!).  We would recant how they first put the chips in the bowl (for nachos), then top it with queso, add rice and your choice of beans, etc.....Today, when I went, it was magical.  But I did make my cashier laugh when I said "And can I have a frosty beverage with my meal?" Goodtimes.

       Hi ladies.  This is a picture of me and john doing what our dance teacher liked to call "a basket" at the wedding.  John is laughing because we tried to go different directions once we arrived in said basket position.  I think it was still pretty cute.  The whole wedding was one big blur so im glad that i have at least one picture (care of my sis) to remind me that it actually happened.  Katie or Alison, if you have any that are good will you email me a couple?  I dont get to see proofs for the professional pics until i get back from my honeymoon.  Which reminds me...Im going to have to find a place to blog when im in France!!!!   For those of you who weren't at my wedding, I couldnt stop talking with a dull southern accent and calling it "Ma Weddin' "

It makes even the skinniest girl look bloated and bottom heavy, and most girls have hips or a bit of a stomach and this look is just not flattering. I get that it's a throwback to our 80s carefree childood days, but no one who wears them has a 6-year-old body anymore. Why are these so popular? Am I missing something?

         So, Michael Moore's new film "Fahrenheit 9/11" will be hitting theatres June 25.  Check out the  urlLink trailer  (even though I couldn't on this computer!).

       Guys!  I just encountered the rodent that's been crashing at my place (it could at least chip in on the rent and food costs, come on).  The story of my little mouse buddy goes back a ways.  A month ago, my friend Heidi was here and she and I started throwing around Hershey's Kisses after we got back from the bars.  Then a couple weeks later, Jon and I were looking behind the couch for something and discovered a pile of mouse poop and Hershey's Kisses wrappings.  So after that we tried to be really careful with the snacks, but I'd often hear some scampering around late at night.  And JUST NOW, I'm sitting here kicking back with a Veggie Delite sub and a Coke (with the TV on, not being quiet at all), and who comes boldly strutting out but the mouse!  I guess it was about time we became acquainted.  I sort of want to leave him some snacks and see if they're gone in the morning.  He looks pretty skinny...it'll be like leaving cookies for Santa!  Anyway, he's much cuter than the gerbils and hamsters I had growing up, and maintenance-free.  I hope he pops out again soon...I'll keep you abreast of any new developments!

       Okay, as I was driving back to work after my doc's appt today, I noticed the marquee at the local McD's/BP combo station said "Free Song with Purchase of a Big Mac".  Seriously!  Now most of you know about my rule to never eat food from gas stations (unless prepackaged) and I considered breaking that rule just to get the free song...but alas, I declined.  What I want to know is, can I request a tune, perhaps something by Stevie Wonder or Prince?  Could Shan request a Smokey Robinson ditty? I may have to investigate on my way home.   This reminds me of the line that Taco Bell used to use that claimed "You like it or we'll eat it!".  I got many a laugh from imagining my cashier actually having to eat my chalupa if I did't enjoy it!    Also, while at the gym this morning, I was people watching (as you do) and saw a youngster doing lat pulls with a SIDE rat tail!!!  I kid you not....his whole head was buzz cut except for a curly puff behind his ear.  Of course I wanted a closer look and sure enough, it was what can best be described as a side rat tail.  Teddy should have got a hold of that one!

I picked up  urlLink Middlesex  by Jeffrey Eugenides, wooed by the 2003 Pulitzer Prize it received and the fact that Eugenides' first novel was "The Virgin Suicides," a book I haven't read but a movie I thoughly enjoyed (even though Kirsten Dunstcap was in it).   Here's an excerpt of a review on Amazon:  " I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless Detroit day in January of 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room near Petoskey, Michigan, in August of 1974.  And so begins Middlesex, the mesmerizing saga of a near-mythic Greek American family and the "roller-coaster ride of a single gene through time." The odd but utterly believable story of Cal Stephanides, and how this 41-year-old hermaphrodite was raised as Calliope, is at the tender heart of this long-awaited second novel from Jeffrey Eugenides, whose elegant and haunting 1993 debut, The Virgin Suicides, remains one of the finest first novels of recent memory."  I haven't gotten too far, but the first-person narrative begins in what I belive to be modern-day Detroit and moves on to 1920s Greece  and then back to prohibition-era Detroit. This will be of no interest to anyone but me, but I'm still writing it...HAHA....."Going Solo," the last book I read, pretty much ends in Greece during World War I, and we revisit a similar place and time in this book, so reading the two was nice and cohesive for me, which is rare when you jump between two books. ANYWAY, as somone who enjoys playing elaborate games of "What if" in my head, (such as asking, "Will my life change drastically if I cross the street now or in the next block? What if I stop to tie my shoe? Will I miraculously miss being hit by a bus? Will that alter the course of the universe?") the story painstakingly details how Cal, the hermaphrodite, comes to be, leaving no chromosone unturned. He even goes back two generations to map out how the chain of events that created him fell into place. So far an interesting read.   Ok, here's the blog of the week.  urlLink Bobbie , like me, or more accuratley my parents, has a dog named Duncan. She can't spell his name and apparently is colorblind. (Sorry if the template burns your retinas. You've been warned) Read about her adventures camping, going to New York to scream outside of the Daytime Emmys (Emmies?) and eat at Applebees(!) and witness her mission to missppell everything she possibly can.   Oh yeah, what's the deal with  urlLink The Onion  not being updated. I'm getting the shakes.

         Remember being a kid and having your grandparents tell you what life was like when they were kids and being shocked at how much they had to suck it up?  I can remember some of my Grandma's farm stories about 4 am wake-up calls and 8 mile hikes to school so clearly, listening intently and thinking "glad I wasn't born yet."  And then as I got older I started wondering if my future kids and grandkids would think the same thing when I told them about growing up in the 80s and 90s (that is, if people are even still talking at that point...maybe all communication will be reduced to IMing and emails and cell phone calls).  I thought we had swift travel covered pretty well with the availability of flying, but I just read this article in  urlLink Discover  magazine that mentions hypersonic vehicles ("scramjets") that are now being tested and could become passenger vehicles in the next decade or two, depending on funding (sorry, they don't have the article online, but still a cool website).  It says you could fly from NY to Tokyo in just a few hours on one of these babies.  Not bad...especially since every time I think about going back to Australia or NZ, the next thought in my head is "how will I possibly handle that plane ride again?"  I don't think I've got it in me, but with this snazzy new jet, maybe I (and my kids) won't have to.

       Yes, David Sedaris is back to his old tricks in his new book "Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim".  He remains an outsider looking in and continues his humorous commentary on his family members, his North Carolina neighborhood, and social expectations.  Apparently, we also get an update on his brother, Paul, better known as The Rooster, who drops the f-bomb like it's going out of style.  Check out this link for a sample from this  urlLink fine novel .  Personally, my fave vignette is the one where his sister, Amy, dons a fat suit for Christmas with the family (from Me Talk Pretty), much to her father's dismay.  She eats mayonnaise by the spoonful from the jar as he encourages her to go for a walk, run up the stairs, do anything to shed the pounds.  The best part is that she could only afford the bottom half, so she's little on top with some junk in her trunk!  I swear I laughed for days off that one....What are some of your faves?

What does that mean? What happened to  unable  to take your call? I think a certain Robert Grant of a certain answering machine message from 1994 would have something to say (on prerecorded message, of course) about that! For some reason this bugs me and I find it weird. Any other common words or phrases that you find people to jack up? I'm trying to think of more.   Went to a fab snack place this weekend in the West Loop called Mr. Beef. It is quite famous and lots of celebs stop in for an Italian beef whilst in Chicago. It was really fun and funny-- all the guys that worked there were true Chicagoans, complete with accent and surly but good natured attitude. I don't think I have a deep love for the Beef like some people do, like the customers that ordered 10 sandwiches and seem to come in every day. But, they did have grape soda which makes my day.

I got at 9/10 because I'm slick like that...but more likely because I have an unhealthy obession with this genre of music. Just last weekend, I was rolling around town, happily listening to Paperboy, Wrexx-n-Effects and Warren G. Not only that, I've seen Too Short, Sir Mix-a-Lot and Digital Underground in concert. Twice. Apparently this is my summer to shine since Young MC, Vanilla Ice...Damn! and somebody else are all coming to my own hometown. Anybody remember who it is?

       Jesus christ!! It is only like 3 days until my wedding!  Im starting to feel a little bit crazy because my mom and sis are here and the only thing we can talk about is the wedding.  I can't believe that it'll all be over soon. Its been a whole year since we started planning it and it's going to be soooooo great not to have to deal with caterers, florists, bands, photographers and stupid site managers from now on.  I know more than ever that I never want to be an event planner.  I really hate that shit!!! But what I am excited about is being able to see all the people I love so much all here in one of my favorite places in the world.  I cannot wait for that!!!! I also can't wait to have the ceremony as I am obviously excited to marry john.  It's just all the other nonsense that tends to make you want to kill something.  Sorry I've been absent a bit from the blog but i've been insane!  Love ya ladies

Here's to your last b'day as a non-married lady :)      To go along with the birthday theme, be sure to check out a Cold Stone Creamery (a yummy ice cream store)near you on June 28th from 5-8pm.

Dahl is one of my favorite authors of all time and is responsible for some of the best fantasy stories ever (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, the Witches, to name a few; all of these are awesome  movies too). He also does great realistic stories like Danny the Champion of the World and Matilda. He truly is one of the greats when it comes to writing books for children and adolescents. Dahl's stories are magical and fantasic, but they don't talk down to kids. He has that rare combination of a beautiful imagination and the knack of remembering just how it feels to be a child. The book is a fun, quick trip through his childhood and includes crude line drawings Dahl did himself. Though he went through some grim times,(harsh English boarding school, the death of his father and younger sister) he maintains a delightful optimistic outlook on his life and it's easy to se how he created his own realistic yet somehow cartoonish characters from the population of his own childhood. As soon as I'm done with this one, it's on to part two of the autobiography, Going Solo.  On a related note, a remake of  urlLink Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  is coming out next summer. Tim Burton's directing it and Johnny Depp will star as Willy Wonka. I don't know if he can top  urlLink Gene Wilder  (who isn't dead. who knew?) but it should be pretty great.   And on to the Internet writer of the week, I offer up to you  urlLink Fred Durst's blog . What a jackass.   Also, so far I've gotten songs for the CD from Katie. As soon as I get the rest, I'll get it together.

It's an interesting phenomenon when rockstars and actors have to wrest politics away from the actual politicians, finally making it cool and glamorous for the youth of the nation to vote. I think it's safe to say Clinton was (not surprisingly) way ahead of the curve when he went on MTV and allowed himself to be asked that infamous  urlLink boxers vs. briefs  question more than ten years ago. Now you've got two major camps of celebrites facing off against each other on who will take the White House in a few months. In one corner, you have  urlLink gum-chomping bubblehead Britney Spears  blindly endorsing Bush in Michael Moore's newest movie. On the other hand, there's Ben Affleck  urlLink pulling a Bono  and showing up at every photographed event surrounding this week's Democratic National Convention.  Back to the subject at hand. Since the line between matinee idols and political figures is blurring even more today, you might as well head to Comedy Central, the new political analysis headquarters and check out some celebs  urlLink sounding off  about voting. David Cross is great... and don't say I didn't warn you, f'n Affleck's all up in this shit.

         My eight-year-old sister and Mary and I were at Target the other day perusing the goods (did anyone see Oprah's bargains yesterday?&nbsp; She's all about Target, apparently...I'm sure she does tons of shopping there), and Mary found a steal: these little tubes of plastic animals for 24 cents each.&nbsp; There were three varieties: jungle, farm, and sea creatures, all very exciting for her.&nbsp; So of course she wants to bust right into them in the car, and in her excitement she commented to me "Isn't it cool all the stuff that China people can make?"&nbsp; I guess she noticed the "Made in China" emblem on those plastic animals and lots of other stuff too.&nbsp; I agreed with her that they were a talented nation, but also mentioned that they weren't paid very well for their work.&nbsp; I have this tendency to tell Mary way too much for someone her age (Bush is evil!&nbsp; Go Kerry!), so I shut it pretty quickly, but I thought it was crazy that an 8 year old has already noticed how many of the toys she plays with are made in China.&nbsp;   In other news, Jon's here!&nbsp; Wahoo!&nbsp; He got in around 4 am and is of course sleeping right now, but I really want to wake him up.&nbsp; I'm trying to hold back; we'll see how long that lasts.&nbsp;

It's not a huge venue, but I'm amazed at the way people here (myself included) are clamoring for tickets. Something happened with their newest release, "Good News for People who Love Bad News." I first realized it when Mike and I were in the electronics section of Target watching the multiplies images of sheep trotting off to slaughter in the "Float On" video. Issac Brock's glue-on moustache twitched as far as the eye could see, mirrored on countless discounted TV screens. From the Target network to MTV the next morning, the Mouse was roaring everywhere. And now the sold-out show. Fans want to see them so badly,  urlLink tickets are going for more than $100 on ebay .   Oh yeah, and since when does Modest Mouse play at  urlLink Paramount's King's Island  theme park? Will they take a break between sets to cruise down the lazy river at water world?

Of course I haven't seen the movie yet (and probably won't until December because I'm bad at keeping up with these things), but from the trailers I've seen, it looks a little self-consciously arty like it's really pulling for that "I'm deep....really!" vibe. Who  knows, though. I could be wrong. I'm not even going to pretend like I'm a regular Scrubs watcher (Braff has a starring role in the sitcom), but every time I catch the show, I really enjoy it. Plus, the  urlLink soundtrack  isn't too shabby, featuring the Shins, Simon and Garfunkel and Iron and Wine (with the lovely cover of the Postal Services' "Such Great Heights," no less.....the Postal Service, blowing up like my Motorola two-way....but that's a whole other post).   All in all, however, the Garden State trailer has caused some ruckus on the Internet and it makes me worry that the movie won't be able to deliver. Check out some  urlLink movie clips  or read  urlLink Braff's blog  to find out more. (links via  urlLink Stereogum )  In other Natalie Portman news....It looks like she'll be starring with Owen Wilson in  urlLink The Smoker , a Richard Linklater-directed movie based on a short story by David Shickler. The Smoker is part of Shickler's book, Kissing in Manhattan, and origianlly ran in the New Yorker in 2000. Read it  urlLink here ; it's good. I think Natalie Portman will be perfect for the part of a sophiticated high school girl, but Owen Wilson as her hapless, lonely teacher? Not so much. I'm still looking forward to seeing it.

      Well, were packing up our whole apartment which we've been accumulating things in for almost 4 years now.  Its really  not too bad but I still need to procrastinate and whine about it a little bit.  We're going to be staying at John's parents house until we move to LA. First we need a place to live out there which we're working on. The married housing at UCLA may be our best option as it is month to month  and since I don't know where I'll be working yet I don't have an idea of what location I'd like to reside in.  The married housing claims it's in Mar Vista/Palms.  Katie, I know you said that  those are not place you'd want to live but do you think it'll be reall unsafe?  I suppose it will just have to do if we get a place there as we could even move out after a month with no penalty and find a better place to live.  Anyways, sorry for the rant directed at Katie everyone.  Again, I'm just trying to procrastinate .  How are all your days??

Don't worry Mike, we didn't take you seriously.  It does make me wonder if Mick's assgrab on Pamela the pretty blonde in the auditorium was him "going to that place" in his character, or if it just came naturally.  Side note:  As a five year old girl, watching Teen Wolf for the first time, I remember being so perplexed and scared by how hairy and old  urlLink Mick  the bully looked as a high schooler, and wanted nothing to do with grades nine through twelve.  Little did I know, that it was just a special boy with overactive glands and a big furry professional baseball career ahead of him.

Brooklyn finally got its very own Target and opened in typical New York style with an  urlLink invite-only party , complete with minor celebs and unknown indie rock bands.   I love Target (not as much as SOME people) but it's light years ahead of Wal-Mart and K Mart in quality, selection and style. Plus,not to be an asshole or anything, the clientele isn't as skeevy and they don't treat their workers like dirt. The place I'm moving in a few weeks is almost directly across the street (ok, highway) from a Wal-Mart and don't even think for a second I'll be trotting over there to make any purchases.

      Hey Friends! As if this week couldn't get any more insane for me,  urlLink Beacon Street Gallery  (my current part time job and one time AmeriCorps assignment) called yesterday to say that I have a full time job! I am soooo jazzed. We were waiting to hear if we would recieve a grant from the good old government to start an arts-integrated cirriculum program in a janky school in Uptown. The money came through yesterday and this means that I can have this job for up to 5 years! In this position, I will be in charge of running the tutoring component of the program. This will include hiring and training the tutors, working with the teachers to make sure the kids' needs are being met, and so forth. Then we will have some good time arts enrichment that will help enforce academic lessons. So, basically, I will just be Jennie Nye (we totally need to conference so you can teach me what you know, Jen!) This is the kind of job I have always wanted, so I feel super lucky.  &nbsp;  All right, kiddos, I guess I'll check in with you after the wedding. I will, for once, use my camera so I can post pics of my tropical vacation! Love ya~&nbsp;  &nbsp;

       I know that a few of you are MoveOn.org members and already got this email, but for anyone who didn't, check out  urlLink this clip  of Bill O'Reilly telling everyone to shut it.&nbsp; "Shut up!&nbsp; Shut up if you don't support the war, just shut up!"&nbsp; You know how the saying goes...if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.&nbsp; Apparently this applies to Americans during a war...if you don't like it, shut up!&nbsp; Cause Billy doesn't want to hear it!&nbsp;&nbsp; And here's a&nbsp;link to a  urlLink petition to complain  to the FTC about Fox News'&nbsp;one-sided&nbsp; reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Ok, so maybe  urlLink this story  from the Women's Wall Street Journal is over-the-top and a hunk of bologna, but it scared the piss out of me.&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes you wonder if the airlines, and&nbsp;the government for that matter are truly looking out for us with all of the loopholes&nbsp;which still exist.  &nbsp;  Insert short, sappy monologue:  &nbsp;  I guess&nbsp;this article&nbsp;just pounds into my head once again, that we must be alert, because airline employees are only allowed to do so much.&nbsp; It's frustrating that something actually has to happen before they can do something about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also say proper I love yous and goodbyes when leaving a loved one even for a day, because true friendships and loves are really what make even a short life, worth living.  &nbsp;  Let me know what you think of the article.&nbsp; Were the 14 gentlemen really in a band?&nbsp;

Somehow they sensed the awesomeness of a picture of her eating beef would cause everyone's minds to explode and they DENIED me my right to toss my artwork onto the 'net (anyone remember that horrid Sandra Bullock movie of the same name?)  After pictures, the next best thing I can think of are links to some fantastic corners of the world wide web of wonders.  So first of, in a nod to  urlLink Mike's  post on walking your cat (which I very much want to do with Otis), I give you  urlLink CatEnema.com , the site that tells the story of a man, his cat and an enema. It's not gross at all and is really a heartwarming story. Read it! You'll be better off.  Not so warm and fuzzy is the story of the Delaware student who  urlLink ate an entire bag of mushrooms, stole a car and ended up lost 300 miles away in Conneticut . I guess that's what living in "Hi, I'm from Delaware" will do to you.  On Slate:  urlLink This guy  hates Wilco and compares them to Hootie and the Blowfish. Okaay....is Jeff Tweedy a regualar on Vh-1's lame ass golf tournament Fairway to Heaven? Nooo. Does he write songs extolling the virtues of the Miami Dolphins? Not so much. Has my mom been in the front row of a huge Wilco ampitheatre concert full of James Taylor fans? Not to my knowledge. Does "Ass Crack"...I mean "Cracked Rear View" hold a candle to the candid, raw emotion of "Summerteeth," or more importantly "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot." Not a chance. So "A Ghost is Born" may be a little mellow and easy on the ears...It's not my favorite Wilco album either, but to compare it to Hootie? That's just not right.  Also on Slate: take the quiz and  urlLink find out if you're a red or blue .  Want to see a perfect marriage of form and function? Just get on a plane and head over to England's Tate Britan museum in London and step into the loo outside  urlLink made entirely of reflective glass . You can see out, but no one can see in. Kind of like those two-way mirrors focus groups use.   A joke for you: What's the opposite of Christopher Reeves? .....Christopher Walken! Heh, is this thing on?   This site just made me laugh, seeing as how Proximity gets a fair share of its hits from people Googling "Christopher Walken More Cowbell." Pop on over to urlLink Walken Around , the musings of an average Walken wannabe in desperate need of more cowbell.

But not really. There's just been nothing for me to say. The muse, she has not been with me; I guess she's on vacation someplace nice. But oh man! That all changed today when I ate fresh at Subway today for lunch. Oh man....the guy behind the counter so totally hit on me. Not only did he give me 2 and not just 1 Sub Club stamps for my 6-inch turkey sandwich, he also slipped 2, COUNT 'EM, 2 chocolate cookies into my bag. I am  en fuego . Now this was a little wierd because I was eating in the restaurant, (it's attached to a gas station, just to give you atmosphere)flipping through a magazine when I reached into the bag to retrieve my napkin and pulled out the cookies instead. What to do? Do I give the Subway guy a wink and a smile while waving the cookies at him like we're in a bar and he just sent me a drink? Cheers to you and your Baked Lays! You know, I've had a few fellas offer to buy me a drink in ma day, but I don't often hang around in the type of bars where people send them over. Of course the fast-food version of this  would happen to me. Ahh, it was only a few short months ago that the Arby's drive through guy had his manager try to slip his number to me when I was pumping my ketchup into those little paper cups. If I had wanted it, should I have stuck my finger into the Horsey Sauce and senuously applied it to my lips and licked it off? I bet that's what freakin' Cosmo would say....My mom said I'd be a real heartbreaker someday.

      Hey all!  I feel bad for not posting, so I figured that I might take a cue from Shan and post about my current annoyances.     1.  Biology      So most of you know that I am taking a Biology class this summer at IUPUI because I never took one at DePauw and it's a prereq for my masters in social work.  UGH!!  There is reason I never took Bio and I feel like sending my advisor from DPU a hate letter for not telling me about this wee prereq when he knew I was interested in an MSW....but I have to ask him for a recommendation, so I might not do that!  So I am sorry, but IUPUI sucks.  I know there are other people out there who attend that hellish academy, some may enjoy it, and I just cannot understand.  Perhaps I am being a whiny, private school bitch, but I LIKE my prof knowing my name and not having a technologically advanced uni (they post class notes online!  I had not idea that even existed; why not just pass them out in class?  Oh yeah, people would have to attend!).  I also like my profs without an Egyptian accent b/c Bio is pretty much a foreign language to me, so having it taught with an accent just compounds that problem.  Why I need to know what hormones the pancreas secretes and where the superior vena cava drops off its blood to tell moms to get a job to get their kids back, I will never know.     2.  Hoobastank      HoobaSUCKS!!!  I hear that stupid song "The Reason" on the radio all of the time.  Actually, one day it was on three radio stations simultaneously!  They are awful....nuf' said.    Okay, I was going to write more, but now I have to work...annoyance #3?  Perhaps....

On an unrelated note:  I've been slacking in the blog department due to the fact that I just got a promotion.  Yay. Promotions are good, but it means more work, and I'm getting used to that.  So I'm now in the Storyboard department at the  urlLink animated series  that was brought back to life due to staggering DVD sales, and I'm lovin it.

Just thought I'd check in and say hi. I was thinking about how many of you are going on Jenny's camping trip, thinking about all the things I did last summer, and realized how tame and lame my summer activities have been so far! Not even a trip to the bacteria infested Chicago beach! Have roller blades, bike, legs, but have not done any physical activity for fun in a long time. Oh well.   Let's see. What have I been up to lately, then? Yesterday I shopped for underwear/lingerie. Not so much fun because I had a nervous breakdown looking at myself in all these getups. No, I'm not that hot. Dressing room mirrors are cursed- even the ones at Victoria's Secret that have low lights and velvety walls. The whole experience was a very good reminder for me. There's a reason why I really don't do these kinds of things.     Went tanning. Tanning is scary. This is maybe the 2nd or 3rd time in my life I've done it, and I just can't handle it! Loud noise and standing in that weird position with your arms away from your sides-- it makes me crazy. I don't think I'll ever get used to it. Going again today. Will try not to panic.   I really hate makeup counters. Yesterday I went to the Clinique counter and the lady said, "Do you want something, or are you just playing around?" Now, keep in mind, I was not acting like a monkey and swinging from the chandeliers. I was looking at eyeliner. $50 later, I still don't think the lady was convinced that I was "serious." That was a good trip, though, because when I have to try on makeup or decide about something vs. stock up on goods, that is even worse. Pushy ladies trying to convince me that purple or green eyeliner is what I've been waiting for to make those eyes pop! That's why I love Sephora- too bad they don't sell everything. Thank God you can get Jessica Simpson's line of edible body crap there, though. There is a life-size cut out of her licking some shit off her finger. Barf.   Ok, that's all the chat I can muster for now. I guess I imagined being a lot more jazzed a week and some change before the wedding. Oddly enough, I just feel kind of depressed. But, I haven't totally lost my Shan self- I actually asked Matt in all seriousness last night if he was jazzed to get married. He responded, "Jazzed? Who uses that word when talking about marriage?" Me, that's who!

         To me, the most important part of getting new digs is finding new places to snack.  NZ had so-so snacks, and Boston just didn't cut it in the Mexican or sandwich department.  So while Jon and I were out in Phoenix last week apartment-hunting, hitting up all the new fast food places was right up there on the priority list...maybe even as the #1 priority.  We were like little kids checking these places out.  When I noticed a sign proclaiming "Sub Factory," we got so excited that we turned that car right around and scooted in straightaway for a snack; another time we saw a later movie so that Jon could have his first In and Out burger.  But for me, the pièce de résistance was none other than Del Taco.  Ahh, Del Taco; my only consolation in writing this is knowing that I'll be back in a few short weeks to get what's mine.  What I get there is a fine Veggie Works burrito.  The burrito shell is superior to Taco Bell's by far, and they also top 'er off with some guac to sweeten the deal.  They serve Coke products instead of Pepsi and have some great hot sauce too.  I don't know how far reaching Del Taco is, but  urlLink make it a part of your next road trip  and locate one nearest you!

       Hi Ladies    For the next day or so ill be checking my email lots as we have internet access at our hotel in Arles.  So far we were in Paris for 10 nights and now we've been in Arles for 2 nights.  We have 2 more nights here and then we go to Nice for 6 nights (yeah beach!!! and Chagall and Matisse Museums) and then we will fly to London and stay for 4 nights before returning to the states from London.  So far weve seen EVERYTHING there is to see in both Paris and Arles and have been having so much fun.  Its been nice and relaxing too to read every night and just hang out.  Here is my other news, our condo has a contract on it and someone will be purchasing it from us 6 days after we get home on July 30th!! so we are going to be home on the 23rd and then have 6 days to move out before the closing on the house.  Then we'll live at john's parents house until we go visit LA on august 9th for a week to find a place to live and hopefully have some job interviews for me.  Well, ill leave you at that.  Love you ladies!

Well, I've been reading the  urlLink Fametracker  forums on Britney's trashy decline, and it's getting a little out of hand with the hillbilly wedding the posters are planning for the Red Bull and Cheetos-addled Ms. Spears. One even created this snazzy  urlLink wedding invitation , and there's a hilarous  urlLink wedding registry  at Amazon.com. If these Fametrackers' predictions are right, Brit won't be singing "Hit me Baby One More Time" when she and Big Kevvie are featured on COPS this time next year for domestic disturbance.  In direct contrast to Brit is  urlLink Gary Benchley , who seems to have found himself a cool bass player but nontheless has gotten into some hot water for racial profiling.    I like  urlLink this site  because it's not only funny, but it has the best name and logo ever. Reer! I was also amused (and saw a bit of myself) by the Black Table's roundtable about  urlLink Turn offs that Turn Ladies on . The article's contributors cite bellies, guys in aprons, fundamentalist Christians and much, much more(!) as turn ons that get them smokin' hot.....Says the belly fetishist who's crushes on both James Gandolfini and Monica Lewinsky (retch),  "Washboard stomachs make me want to run screaming; flat stomachs are like flat chests to me, they just do nothing for me. But curvy, pillowy bellies that I can lay my head on, that I can rub up against, tease and tickle and bite and lick, tweak gently when I'm busy doing something else, get me every time."  To each her own, I 'spose.   If you've seen Farenheit 9/11, and I'm pretty sure you have, Salon has an interesting interview with  urlLink Lila Lipscomb , the greiving mother at the heart of the film. I, for one, found her transformation fascinating but pretty frustrating. It's sad she had to learn the lesson of questioning authority only after she lost someone so dear to her.

       Gals, I am feeling so very youth of the nation right now.  I'm posting from one of the ASU computer labs.  Ahh, college.  I love this campus; it's gorgeous!  Anyway I have to let you in on this anomaly I just witnessed and see if any of you have been privy to such a thing.  I was in the women's restroom and noticed that the handicapped stall is equipped with not only a toilet but also a urinal.  Urinal?  In the women's, you say?  Yes, I do.  I even double-checked.  My best guess is it's some kind of mother and son's potty break package.  Which makes a little sense, but who wants to see a urinal in the ladies' bathroom?  Certainly not me.  I'd never use the handicapped stall because of it.  Weird.  Any of you ever see the likes of this in your stomping grounds?

How you livin'? In case anyone thought that I dropped off the face of the earth, I'm taking a moment to let you all know that I am, in fact, alive and well. I think I needed a hiatus from the world of blogging/beefing to focus on the insanity I'd like to call my present life. Here's what I've been up to in the past few weeks. Judge my freak/Mrs. in training/total slacker behavior for yourself:  1. I've been traveling (covertly) to Indianapolis and Cincinnati  a lot  lately. In fact, I have the pleasure of returning this weekend. Anyone want to hang out on Saturday night? I think Teddy's DTC. I went to one wedding in Cinci and did not bring a gift. There was another wedding the same day and I have the gift but did not go. Is it tacky to give others wedding gifts at my wedding? Believe me, it's happening.  2. Had a fab wedding shower 2 weekends ago. Lots of friends (yay Aly) and psycho friends of my mom kickin it, playing weird games, and eating some tasty snacks. In a moment of great shame, my aunt blindfolded me and I had to dress myself in a man's clothes. Don't ask. Btw, Alison, did I look like a total moron? I felt it. For some reason I remember the room as being completely silent...or is that just my neuroses? Received a ton of kitchen related gifts. Too bad I really don't cook all that much.   3. Flew back to Chicago after bridal shower and worked at Beacon Street. Did lots of prep for downtown mosaic project with kids from Uptown, Ida B. Wells housing and oh, yes, Candyman, Cabrini Green. The project starts tomorrow. We are going to be working outside at State and Randolph streets, which is literally the center of the city (across from Marshall Field's and the Chicago theater). Plan on being very tired, getting funky tan lines, and repeatedly telling the youth of tomorrow it's not ok to use profanity in the workplace.   4. Saw Fahrenheit 9/11 on the 3rd. I was amazed that we had to line up over an hour before the film started. I'm beefing about the fact that MM is uber popular now...is it bad that the general population, especially in large, popcorn snarfing crowds highly annoys me? I thought the film was so-so. Moore really hooks the audience with emotional factors, and I find that once that is stripped away, I'm not that impressed. Some good points, and rah-rah for beefing about Bush, but I think he's just a leetle too jazzed that he's so popular. For crying out loud, take a look at the movie posters. Why put yourself on the ad? My feeling is, if he was a true documentarian he would let the film largely speak for itself.   5. Went to my first "condo" party on the 4th. Have huge hangover today as result. Our friends recently bought a nice condo and had some pals over for a birthday/4th party. Why do people think that they are automatically required to give fancy adult parties just because they don't live in a shithole anymore? When the crew visited earlier in the spring, I tried to be the jankiest hostess on the planet! Seriously, once people upgrade to the leather furniture and "gourmet" kitchens, out come the martinis, designated "bar" (not some bottles on the counter) and appetizers.   6. Almost done with very good book entitled  We Were The Mulvaneys  by Joyce Carol Oates. It is my first read by Oates, and I am pleasantly surprised, considering it is an Oprah book. I wish she didn't have to put her stupid emblem on every book in her housewife club! The novel centers on the large Mulvaney family that disintegrates after the rape of the only daughter. Set in the 70's, the rape is treated as the daughter's  fault and the repercussions of denying the facts surrounding the trauma are explored through the following 15-20 years. Really a great book. Has great depth and emotion.  7. Last but not least, I am in full wedding mode. I have become very friendly with my glue gun (yes, I recently purchased this handy item), handmade a rather lopsided pillow for the ring bearer, tea-dyed the "offensive" (according to my madre) slippers I will wear on the day, made programs, favors, and attempted to assemble the RSVP's. What I cannot figure out, though, is why so many people I have talked to have told me that they threw away the rsvp card or the invitation all together! Pardon? And, almost half of the guests have not responded yet with a July 10th rsvp date. Either everyone hates me and I just don't know it, or some people are going to be on the post-wedding beef list!   Ok, over and out.

         Okay, I am sick of "Extreme" this and "Xtreme" that!  Seriously, everytime I turn around there is another extreme product, whether it be Gatorade, Road Rules, or Trojans.  This has just got to end!  I mean, is EXTREME fruit punch really that different than regular fruit punch (and would anyone prefer a Hawaiian Punch?)?    Today I received an email from "Your Soulmate"....I was extremely excited that Prince Charming had finally found my email address until I opened some spam mail.       Jenny and I were chatting about this in NYC and I wanted to open it up for convo: When you go to Victoria's Secret (or Gap or wherever) and purchase 5 panites for $25 (not $9.99), do you have trouble selecting that fifth pair?  Like you have four cute pairs and then you have that blasted fifth one and just pick a random print or color?  Then it ends up being your LEAST fave pair to wear and you wonder "why did I get grey and not black?".  Yeah, I am a victim of the ugly print...     This is Snow Patrol.  They are great.  You should have a wee listen!

I smell an election campaign cover-up.  I've been in the weird LA bubble, so maybe I've just been oblivious to it all.  Apparently the veep and Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont got to talking about life, politics, religion, and oh yeah, Halliburton.  Well good ol' Dick thought them's fightin' words, so he proceeded to drop the F-bomb an estimated 8 times towards Sen. Leahy.  Let's remember that C-Span was airing this live, and I'm sure there were a few kids on a field trip sitting in up top with eyes and mouths wide open.  The  urlLink LA Weekly  has fun little article on how various newspapers reported Cheney's flub.  urlLink The Washington Post  was the only paper that actually printed the word.  There's a rule stating Senators cannot speak this way on the Senate floor.  Do you really think Cheney would get in trouble, and get a fine from the FCC for his harsh words?  Poor Howard Stern.  Although I don't like most of his "humor", it does suck that he has to shell out $250,000 everytime he says the F word, just because he's not above the law.  Apparently, Cheney is allowed in speaking this way, even though he's technically the president of the Senate.  Because he's a member of the executive branch, he's able effing say whatever the eff he wants.

I think that's a positive step towards slimming down the little schoolchildren, not to mention making them a little less hyper than they already are.  That means they can still have 7-Up, Fresca, Fanta products, Squirt, Teem, Canada Dry Ginger Ale, and Hires Root Beer.  We had Fanta back in the day at Boston Middle School.  Orange was my fave.  Please note the old school logo , which I think would appeal to the masses more so than the current cracked out logo they have.    When I was a teen, I didn't have the option of buying "pop" at school, nor did I want to.  We did, however, have every kind of Hostess treat known to man, and I did have a brief Honeybun-only-for-lunch phase followed by a brief stint of all things fried potato and cupcake.  That was nixed quickly after I passed out in basketball practice for having a major sugar low.  I was a gradeschool parochial gal gone public for grades 6-8, going from being told what I was having to being told I could eat what I wanted.  I think kids who have parents that care about healthy eating habits will ultimately have kids that do the same.  Having folks who cared when I was younger definitely made me straighten out after a few months of Hostessin' out.    Did any of you out in P-ville have weird, bad, or maybe extremely good eating habits back when you first had a lunch choice?

Shake hands. Hug maybe. I think the two of you are going to be beeest friends! For real, I'm just now beginning to obsess over Beck's  urlLink Midnite Vultures , an album that came out when I was a SOPHOMORE in college. You heard it here, the offical jam of the summer is "Hollywood Freaks."  This is the thing with Beck, he's the modern-day David Bowie, constantly reinventing himself (with integrity, unlike Madonna) and creating new sounds and even genres. Look, they even have similar album covers (Bowie, Aladdin Sane; Beck, Sea Change). Beck actually has a beautiful voice and when really uses it, I think he sounds like Bowie too. To be completely honest, I'm a little obsessed with deciding who is the modern-day version of someone who has come before. Radiohead is to Pink Floyd what Jeff Tweedy is to Bob Dylan, in my opinion. Beg to differ? Let me know who I'm missing. I love analogies when they're not on standardized tests!     Here's another one: how much is poor, crazy Courtney Love starting to look like poor genuis Tom Hulce in the movie  urlLink Amadeus . Um, except for the part where Mozart is actually talented.   Speaking of old movies, I just watched  urlLink Harold and Maude  for the first time last night. This pleaser from the freezer (made in 1971) gets high recommendations from me, but I can see where some might be put off by it's story: A suicidal young man (think 20) finds true love with a life-loving older woman (think 80). I know, kind of skeevy, but it's incredibly dark, funny and thought-provoking all at once. The all Cat Stevens (don't laugh!) soundtrack really added a lot too and renewed my love for the song "Trouble." Content notwithstanding, this movie was so beautifully shot that anyone interested in art, composition or photography would probably enjoy it. One of my favorite shots is when Harold (young boy) is standing at a huge plate-glass window and a door slams and the viewer can see the glass vibrate from the impact, causing Harold to turn around. So realistic and subtle.  Go, now. Go. For entertainment, I've also been reading the  urlLink My So-Called Life recaps  at televisionwithoutpity.com. Each episode is painstakingly (and humorously) recapped and it's making me feel the strong urge to buy the DVDs one of these days.   Finally,  urlLink find out  if Gary Benchley got that hot chick drummer he was looking for. Oh, and last but not least,  urlLink here's  a good site for music downloads.

Read the hard-htting questions and soul-searching responses from a group phoner with sex addict, Justin Timberlake archnemesis, Michael Jackson wannabe circa 1988, ex boyfriend of Chili from TLC...and oh yeah, R&B singer Usher Raymond. From what I can tell, he feels blessed.

      The past 2 nights in our apartment have been interesting, to say the least. A new gal has moved in upstairs and let me tell you, we are in crazy land! Since I officially start working next week (thank god) I am kickin it at home and around town this week. This gal upstairs is apparently home all day but hardly makes a peep. We can hear people walking around-- virutally every step, so it is more than obvious when someone is in the apartment upstairs. So, this person makes virutally no noise all day long, but at night-- the freaks come out! Starting around 11 (usually when Matt and I go to bed) she and some other person (we guess to be a guy) are apparently moving large pieces of furniture across the floors and dropping them right above our heads. So, I've hooked it up with the earplugs and have been sleeping ok, only to wake up for the extra loud noises. It's par for the course when you live in an apartment. But, the real treat was last night. We thought the guy that used to live upstairs was loud- apparently he was not getting laid! At the start of the very loud 12:30am s-e-x (bed squeaking like you wouldn't believe) Matt and I flicked on the light and uttered the profanity of our choice, only to find that the roll in the hay only lasted for about 2 minutes! Tee hee. At least we can count that kind of noise to be minimal!

       Ok, so as most of you know I am a social worker, not by training, but by default...and I have an observation. The population I work with is what they call "involuntary" meaning they don't want to work with myself and my co-workers, but it is court ordered. So, needless to say they are not too pleased when I prance on up to their doors all day and knock and then make them talk about the most stressful thing in their lives.  Well, to get to the point of this blog, it has been really hot lately here in humidville, USA and I have noticed that not only are my clients acting strange, but their neighbors are as well. I was at an apartment complex in a lovely area at 38th and Post road when a young man ran up to me and yelled "Hey Lady" in my face and then ran off. Now, as a young social worker, how am I to interpret this behavior. Not really knowing what to say to this young man, I yelled back "Hey" as he ran away. I have been doing this job a year and that is the first time I have had that happened, maybe the heat got to him? I didn't really think much of it, but I went to another clients house at 10th and Rural and was walking towards their house when this random woman came up to me and asked me what time it was, so I told her. When she heard the time she then told me to "get a life and leave her alone" Ok, seriously what is wrong with people...?? My only explanation is the heat!

       Hey! Now I know it's been a while since I posted and I bet you all have been counting the days until I rejoined the blog, so rejoice, the fasting is over!  I am now finished with Americorps Year 1 (save a couple hours to keep my health insurance kickin'), so I no longer clock 40+ hours a week at the Julian Center. While I did enjoy my time there, I am stoked to begin Americorps Year 2 with Peace Camp at the end of this month. What am I doing with my time now that I no longer have a day job?      Ahhhh....but never fear, I still am waiting away at Sully's, finishing Bio-hell (one more day!!!), and getting prepped for my LSAT class.  If you fancy, check out my pics from the  urlLink Coogman nuptuals . A few are pretty dark, but there are some shining stars! BTW, that wedding was the BEST!  On a final note, one of my friends from NZ, Brett, has retaliated against me for signing him up for an email company that harasses him (actually he is confusing me with someone else, but long story). So he is now forwarding me porn...what an interesting way to get back at people that send/sign you up for crap emails. If anyone needs some new sights, I've got the hook up!

The winner of the night was  urlLink 22-year-old Gavin Griffin , a regular guy from Illinois, now the youngest player to win a bracelet from the tournament. When I was watching this fresh-faced tyke, I couldn't help but notice that he bore a striking resemblance to melon-headed James Van Der Beek (not that I think you have a big head, Gav....call me!) and if anyone ever decides to make a movie of his meteoric rise in Vegas, Dawson should definitely be tapped for this role. His finest moment since Varsity Blues I'd say. He can tap into all of that Texas-athelte angst he corralled for that movie and pour it all out at the Texas hold 'em table. Maybe Ali Larter can show up in a whipped cream bikini just for kicks.  Speaking of movies in the making (real movies, not the ones in my head), Ben Stiller is reportedly interested in making a  urlLink movie version  of George Saunder's short story "CivilWarLand in Bad Decline" (read an excerpt of it  urlLink here ). The hilarous postmodern story is from a collection that goes y the same name and is one of my favorite books. I'd love to see how a movie version would work. Also included in the collection is a story called "Offloading for Mrs. Schwartz," which revolves around a mind-erasing machine and reminds me a lot of  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  (Oooh! Oooh! It looks like someone else  urlLink agrees with me ). Anyway, a great book if you like David Foster Wallace, Umberto Ecco, John Barth....sometimes he's compared to Dave Eggers (ugh). What do we think about Ben Stiller starring in something like this?   If you don't care about that, maybe you'd rather look at  urlLink ads that appeared in  Ebony  magazine in 1972 . Or....please, please click on this video of  urlLink women dancing with cats ! It's so awesome, you might go insane. If Britney has any hope of ressurecting her post-Federline career, she needs to hire these ladies as backup dancers STAT.  Did you know that  urlLink Bush has a blog ? And the CIA is pissed.  Certain rockstars that aren't too happy with W. for real are in the midst of organizing the  urlLink Vote for Change  tour to raise money to help the dems campaign in swing states. Novel idea, but unfortch. for me that means there's no way this roadshow is coming to staunchly Republican Indiana. I'm DTC with all the political fervor that's been going on lately, but can we just add one tiny item to the blue ticket this time round? BRING SOME DECENT SHOWS TO INDIANA. Don't just hit up Cincinnati (why even bother?), skip over the Hoosiers and head straight into Chicago. Yeah, I know I need to move, but looking at tour schedules can get a little depressing sometimes. I digress. Bands participating in the tour include Pearl Jam, Springsteen, Bright Eyes, Dave Matthews Band and the Dixie Chicks.   Just one more thing because I need to rant. Right now I have three bullhorns in my office that I need to use next Monday (don't ask. It's not that interesting). If one more person walks by, picks one up and talks into it, saying something like "Alison, I need your attention please," I'm going to press the megaphone right up to their ear and turn on the siren. Ok, better now.

       A contributor to Idealist.org's August 1 article, "Women Criticize Vatican Document on Feminism" states that "no religion is a great friend of women." This is in response to the Vatican's statements concerning feminism's role in the decline of the traditional family and family value system. Do you agree with this statement? I have to admit that I have very conflicted feelings on this issue (just got married at a catholic church). I think some religions could be pals of the gals, but I don't know enough to say which ones. Thoughts? Sometimes I think that my Catholic upbringing has transferred and transformed itself into a belief in the principle of Karma, but I'm just not willing to admit it and research the whole thing. How do my fellow IHM/CHS-ers feel?

      and it sucked! Kidding. Hi Gals! I'm so happy to be back in Chicago and the world of blogging. To start with the most obvious news, the wedding and honeymoon are now wonderful memories. Yes, that's right, the Coogman family has officially come forth. I had an awesome time at the wedding and reception (hope you all did too) and the honeymoon was incredibly beautiful (the vest ensemble greatly enhanced the experience!). It is amazing how relaxed I became once we were in Turks and Caicos. I don't think I had let myself slow down that much in a long time!  In terms of the H-Moon, we didn't do too much. Our resort had a fab beach, so Matt and I logged the majority of our time in the beach chairs. The water was amazingly clear- I had never seen anything like it in my life. We did go horseback riding on the beach, which was cool, and not nearly as movie-glamorous as I expected. Lots of horses pooping and inexperienced riders like myself screaming when the horses all decided to gallop. We also went on a snorkeling trip that was quite fun. As a first timer, I was a little frightened but soon buddied up with a 9 year old British lass who also wanted to wear a life preserver whilst snorkeling in 10ft. of water. Thank god dorks love company! The trip included diving for conch shells, which the boat driver then prepared into conch salad on the beach. I have to admit that I was not skeptical in terms of eating the snack because a shell just doesn't seem, well, alive. We were able to take home the shells and the one we have is pretty smelly.  One good story for Alison: Matt and I were eathing dinner pooliside at some resort when a super friendly cat just sauntered up to our table and sat at my feet for the entire meal. He tried to jump into my lap a few times to snag a bite of my crab legs, but Matt was not a fan. It just sat there and stared at us. Very bizarro to see a cat kickin it at the beach.  So, I'm home...happily remembering all the good times had in these past few weeks and enjoying getting back to my life. It has never felt so good to shower in my own shower, sleep in my own bed, and just live in my apartment. I am starting a new job position today so I can't wait to get to work. More about that later and I will post beach pics soon as well. I'm reading 2 selections from my bachelorette party: The Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex and How to Be a Great Lover. So far it's safe to say that I am not failing by these author's standards. In the Guide, the "good girl" is actually typecast as a gingam-wearing, puffy sleeved Laura Ashley dresser! Gads. I'll let you know how they turn out.

       The other day on my endless drives around the lovely Marion County I was listening to NPR, because the rest of radio sucks and I heard a very interesting news bite. They stated that Eukenuba had come up with a type of dog food to feed your dog when they are puppies to make them smarter. The point of this is that the leading cause of death for dogs is being put to sleep in a shelter, so Eukenuba is thinking that by having smarter dogs, people will be able to train their dogs eaiser and therefore, not get annoyed with their dogs and give them to shelters.  I have a few problems with this one serious, one not so serious...  First of all, all dogs are trainable and a dog making mistakes is the owners fault. Most dog owners have to spend a lot of time training and playing with their dogs to make sure they are good dogs, not just one time and then give up  Secondly, I wonder would feeding my dog Juno dog food to make her smarter prevent her from doing all of the annoying this dogs do, like rolling in horse poo? I think not! A dog is a dog for a reason, they aren't always the most brillant creatures, but they love us and thats why we love them!
