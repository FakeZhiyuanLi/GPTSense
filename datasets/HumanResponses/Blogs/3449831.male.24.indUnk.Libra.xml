      Well, monday morning is here and today at 5 am when all non-retail people are still asleep. I have awoken to an overcast sky to realise that I've probably never had off a memorial day since high school. I am just destined to have off Christmas and Thanksgiving as those are the only two days that retail will ever close. And even then they will try to get you to work if you can. Alas, such is the world of retail.

      Man have I got to use the bathroom!!! It's memorial day weekend. Tons of Harley Davidsons roam about the streets. Those who have died in wars are remembered & honored. It has a whole new meaning to me now that my father has passed on. He served in Vietnam and although his passing was a result of PTSD and other things beyond his control, it made me realise that he did do something right and for his country. Good man.

      So, last night I'm eating dinner at the table which currently houses all of my Yu-Gi-Oh cards. And I ask myself, "Self, when are you going to get all this crap off of the table?"  I tell myself, "Self, there's a method to this madness." That's when I stopped myself. Had I come to this? That I have a method planned out on how to organize my yu-gi-oh cards? it was already bad enough that i'm a 24 year old male that plays yu-gi-oh... a game meant for kids. I know there are adults that play this game, but they're usually fat, bald, own a comic book store type deal. I'm not bald and i  don't own a comic book store. So that just makes me that much more cooler than a fanboy.   In other news, my cousin is visiting new york. This made me rekindle my interest in going to NYC. It's been almost 4 years since i've last been. I used to go every year. I miss that big city. That city so nice they named it twice. At least it's not baltimore. I've gotten mugged up there. And it's a crazy city lately what with an abandoned child there last week and now the sad news of three children found decapitated. Sad.

      maybe i'm missing something here. But doesn't it take two people to have a relationship? Each of them doing things to make the other happy? Yet, at the same time loving the fact that the other is happy. And at which point does one give up when they see the other isn't making the same comittment that they are to make the other happy?   like i said. maybe i'm missing something here.

      That's the one thing about the internet. It doesn't complain that it's tired when I wanna stay up and just ogle at the screen and fondle its buttons. Ah, if life could be so simple.   Today at the Depot (my place of employment) we're preparing for a visit from our divisional president. I guess it's an honor really. He's picked our store out of 800 stores to visit. Apprently he visits 4 stores a year and we're one of them. It's amazing how coporate business can be a lot like american politics. We have a president that makes decisions for the better of the people, yet, they hardly go and mingle with the people. Dubya probably does the same thing. He picks 4 ghettos a year to go and visit, just to see how they're running.

      I believe I am about to kill the next hispanic that comes up to me and speaks spanish. Does it make me racist or just republican to say that most dominating non-white race needs to learn english?? I hear all the time, "you need to learn spanish." Why the hell should I learn spanish?? I grew up learning english! Half of the hispanic community   moved here    so they should learn english!!   What's worse!?!? There are free programs all over this D.C. area that teach english for free with the help of my tax dollars... yet.. if I want to learn spanish... I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT at some community college or something.  Sometimes i really hate my kind.

      Good day to all that choose to read. Much like the O.C. the M.V. is filled with a whole bunch of rich white kids.  And... well.... I'm not one of them. In fact, I happen to live on the west side of the M.V.    M.V. stands for Mount Vernon. As in Mount Vernon, Virginia. Home of the original pimp daddy of our country, the first George W.; George Washington. I can literally walk over to the Washington Estate. Really, much hasn't changed since the hey days of 'ol Georgie boy.  You have the upper class that literally live on the same street as old George used to live on. You have the poor and middle class living on what used to be George's slave land (conveniently with a wal-mart located right on it). And in the middle of it all you have Richmond Hwy./Rt. 1./Jefferson Davis Hwy One damn road with tons of different names. It's sole purpose is to divide southern Alexandria into social halves.   What about me you ask? And if you don't, oh well, you're hearing it anyway. I happen to be the whitest hispanic you will ever meet.  This is the official title given to me by my best friend who happens to live in a trailer park. Now you know it takes a lot of skill to be whiter than a trailer park resident. I grew up in northern VA all of my life. Haven't really left the area. I'm a public transportation ride away from Washington D.C.  and I work for a living. I went ahead and bypassed the four years of illusion that is college and jumped right into the real world.  So, I don't have a peice of paper that says I've mastered english or psychology or some other useless propaganda that allows me to make something above 50K a year. I do well without it earning my 30K. I am engaged to a wonderful woman that puts up with most of my bullshit I throw at her. (i gotta quit that). And I live an alternative life in the world of Vana'Diel as Yuelue, currently a level 10 redmage. And as if that wasn't dorky enough... I play yu-gi-oh... the game... kinda like pokemon but probably meant for the jr. high kids instead of the six year olds.   So, without further adieu... I will in the future try to post more thought and less story-telling because that is what makes a blog, right? i thought so.

      Who the hell keeps up with these things anyways?!?! eh? not like i have anyone reading it. Anyways, i'm actually thinking about getting serious on this wedding thing. our date is may 21 of next year. but according to my expert fiance, it takes a year to plan it. I've never been big on plans. just kind of play it by ear that way there are no surprises when something screws up. But I guess it's something I can do to make her happy.... help her plan that is. Yeah.... that would be a good thing that way she's not weighted down with everything.  in other news. my best friend is joining the air force. i'm not too sure how i feel about this. in a way i hope he does. I don't mean this in a bad way, but he does need some guidance in his life. he can't work the way he's working forever. especially with family. So, maybe that will help. Maybe i need the same help. No clue where I want to go or what i want to do. Right now i'm in a position where I'm comfortable enough to make a living... but is it what I want to do the rest of my life? retail? the big orange box? i tell everyone that I want to go back to school but i have made zero effort to do so.   looks like rain outside... better wrap up before t-storm hits me.   and in the end... the love you take is equal to the love you make!

       So, i thought I would try out a new font. Flashy, huh? The past few days have been days of discomfort... mostly because of this daggone computer chair that is duct-taped together. And the rest because of people's feelings. You want to do something but can't&nbsp;because you're a sucker for considering other people's feelings. Thankfully though they have been very considerable of our feelings as well.     &nbsp;  The fiance is gone tonight. That means it's a party!!!!  in final fantasy XI that is.     &nbsp;  I'll probably stay up really late partying and mingling with the elvaan chicks or Mitra... hecks yeah!!!! Who knows... I might score  some killer experience points  !!!!     &nbsp;  God, someone take me... now!

       So, I thought I would try a new font color. Perhaps it will bring some excitement to the game here. Or not. I forget, maybe i have&nbsp;a green background so you won't be able to see any of this and you all will be screwed!!! MWAH HA HAHAHA!!! ... ha.     &nbsp;  So, let's. How do I summarize 30 days?     &nbsp;  Not much.    &nbsp;  I think that about does it. Right now We're cleaning out our turtle tanks.  urlLink Turtles  are dirty dirty creatures, which probably explains why they're always found in swampland and lakes & such. Because that....mind you... is their natural habitat.&nbsp; I really want to get my  urlLink Rocky &nbsp;on... but alas... money prohibits such.    &nbsp;  Anyways, back to cleaning.

       So, after an eventful weekend of hijinxs and hilarity it all comes down to an end as we begin the second week of august. SUCK! It's amazing how time flies and we're just all caught up in it. It reminds me of a poem...i'm not sure if I wrote it or not. I have a feeling I did, or I did a varition on another poem... or perhaps i didn't, i'm not 100 % sure. And since I dont' have the resources to find out I'll just leave it as author unknown.       Time   Time to change   play   i've played the game   when self destruction   can take my place   it's an uneasy truth    i have to face      there's more to it... but unfortunately that's all i can actually remember. oh well. that's why i was never a good poet. Used to write it all the time in high school thinking i was all deep and all knowing. Now i look back on it and read it.. and wonder what the hell kind of crap was i thinking? But... at the same time i say to myself, "Wow... this was deep and all knowing."      Tomorrow I go fishing with even bigger goons than myself. I will be sure to report on the hijinx and hilarity and hillbillydom that ensues from that trip. one can only imagine what Burt Reynolds is doing at Burke Lake.

       Weirdest ass dream last night.  In perhaps my first Home Depot related dream. One of my garden associates was making an S&M video... apparently it's required for immigration purposes... And... I was the lovely star as..... THE GIMP. Needless to say there was no actual S&amp;M... just me on a leash. I was walked to the back where science class was being held... and it was at this point that I had to force myself to wake up because heck... If i'm wearing a leash... dammit... someone had better be whipping me or else it's all over!... but alas... no whip... no leather... nada! oh...woe is me!

      I hate being a broke ass. Especially when my ass really isn't worth much. It's not even a round ass that looks good. At least, no one else has said anything about it. But, enought about my ass. It's work time!!!  Today i begin my daily regiment of excercise in hopes to lose some weight. God, the agony of moving around. Damn heart and its weak ass ways.
