      Today is Memorial Day and I'm going to be a little serious with this post. Today is a day in which we should all reflect on the lives of the soldiers who have died defending this country. They have given their blood to protect the lives and rights of others not just in their country, but around the world. On June 6th, 2004, it will be 60 years to the day since the Allies invaded Normandy, France on a day that we know as 'D-Day'. It was a battle that the Allies had desperately needed to turn the tide of the war. Today, we are facing a new enemy. Only this time it is hidden from us and we sometimes aren't exactly sure what we are fighting. One might say we are fighting terrorism, other ignorant people might say we are fighting Afghanistan or Iraq. Bush's so-called 'fight against terrorists' is simply impossible. You can't wipe terrorism from the face of the planet.  IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN!  The reason why we are fighting other peoples' war is to liberate them from their strict religious law imposing governments and expose them to democracy. Today's war is a different kind of war. During World War II, our soldiers deaths' meant something. Unfortunatly today, coalition soldiers overseas have no idea what they are doing there in the first place.

      Haha! I had to umpire a little league game today at 6 but I called it early so that I can leave. Besides, there was lightning and I had to call it...didn't want to play in the rain. Return of the King comes out tomorrow on DVD...can't wait for that. Dum dum di dum...killing time......blah! Yanks off today..no sports to watch on tv. School...sucks. Oh, my mom came home today and told me that I was sending nasty text messages to a friend of mine who ditched us for his girl. 1) I didn't send any text messages and 2)if someone did...he deserved it. His girlfriend has taken over his life! We gotta save him.  Weird news of the day:  urlLink Mayor Tells Sorcerers to Banish Evil Spirits

      What a day today has been. After waking up around 10:30 this morning and helped my parents with work in the back yard, I went to the North Babylon High School today to play handball with a few of my friends.....for at least 5 hours. It was hot and very tiring at the end. We went to Adventure Land in Farmingdale tonight and there were some pretty hott (or bangin') girls there. My friends and I talked to a few and messed around with each other but nothing big happened. Anyways, I just got home about an hour ago and I'm ready to go to sleep. I'm still waiting on the picture I sent to myself through email of us playing handball. I'll post it up when ever I get it. Until later, pe@ce out!

      Ahhhh....another day off from school. I go to a Catholic High School and these past two days were known as 'The Ascension', so we had off. I'm just waiting for my friends to get home so we can start the weekend. I was playing Star Wars Galaxies all morning and thus has been the highlight of my day so far. Hopefully tonight, my friends and I will go to Cafe Royale's Billards to play some pool tonight. If we do, I'll show you some pictures. Maybe we might try and sneak into the strip club if all goes well. Wish us luck!  Weird news of the day:  urlLink Naked Students Ride Roller Coaster...break world record!

I enjoy playing video games, hanging with friends, and playing sports (baseball is my fav). I'm a big Yankees fans and an expert ATV rider. Hopefully I would love to race one day.

      Well guys, I'm getting ready to go upstate for the weekend with my dad. He wants to look at a few houses there that he can fix up and hope to make some money on. I doubt that we'll buy anything though. Last night, the Yankee/Met game got rained out so they are going to play a double header on Sunday which is gonna be great! I hate the Mets and hope that the Yankees crush them like the little bugs that they are. Anyways, I hope to be back Sunday with stuff to write about.

      After a few unsucessful at bats this year, I finally managed to get a hit last night against Huntington. Two hits to be exact. I hit a single right past the 1st baseman and then a bunt single 2 innings later. I went 2-3 last night with 2 singles and a ground out. We had a chance to win the game in the 7th inning, but Huntington was able to score two more runs to tie it at 4-4. We went into one extra inning and didn't score anything. We ended tying which was rare. We are 1-4-1 on the season. It feels good to actually tie. We are playing against college level people and its hard to win. So far on the year I am 2-8 (.250 AVG) with 2 singles, 4 strikeouts, and 2 walks. I hope I can keep this momentum going.

      Fucking West Islip! We were supposed to have a game there against Huntington because that's the way the schedule was put together. According to them, we didn't have the permits to play on a field that no one was using at the time. In a way, its kinda good that we didn't play. Most of the people on the other team were graduating seniors! I'm only a sophmore! Some league we play in. I'm gonna play some Desert Combat now. Until next time, peace out!

      The Global History regents is probably the longest test I have ever taken in my life! It had 50 multiple choice questions, a thematice essay, a few document based questions, and top it off with a DBQ essay. It took me the full 3 hours to complete it. The good news is.....it was easy as pie. Yup. Deffinetly one of the easiest tests I have ever taken. It was even eaiser than my math final which I know I bombed. So far no phone call which means I passed. Lets hope it never comes.

      Well today I had my second baseball game of the season. I struck out looking and pop out. I am 0 for 4 on the season and I hope to change that soon. Tomorrow I gotta get up early and go to breakfast with Jimmy to friendly's. It's also my dad's birthday so I have to be home a little early. On Thursday and Friday, I have to go to school to take a global history and earth science regents. After this week...... I AM FREE!!!

      When I saw my math final yesterday morning, I read the first question, then closed the book and sat back. The test was literally impossible! Have of the shit on that test I don't even remember our teacher going over it! I felt sick when I saw that test and now God forbid if I fail, I might have to go into remedial math. In other words, I'll be in "stupid math". My theology final went well considering Mr. Barbier made all the questions easy to answer. At least I have today off. I'm going to the Yankee game tonight and maybe I just might bring back some pics to show you guys. I'm out for now.

      Wow! I had an unbelievable weekend. Saturday morning, I flew with my dad to Fort Myers, Florida to see some possible jobs my dad might do for some customers he knows. We then drove to Miami Beach to see another place. Miami is gorgeous. The view, the weather, the girls....its just simply amazing. I posted a pic below of Miami Beach. I got home at around 10:30 last night and had McDonalds for dinner (airplane had shit for food). Today was also my last day of classes and somehow it didn't really feel like it. Just felt like a simple normal day. I have finals all this week and get home at around 12. This is gonna be great. Summer is approaching sooo fast and I can't wait. I also can't wait to go to Robbie's party! Woohoo! Summer 2004!!!!!!!!!

      Lately, I've been getting lazier and lazier to update my web blog. I usually start things and never finish them. That's just the way I am. Yesterday I had to umpire a little league game and boy did that sucked. I thought it was gonna be a short, continuation game. No, it wasn't. The score was tied and people were getting frustrated at my strike zone. The fucking coach said I was "terrible". FUCK YOU! God, were you behind the plate asshole? Is it my fault your pitcher throws balls 10 feet above the batter and into the dirt. God, you have got to be fucking kidding me. Ahhh, now that's off my chest, I have some good news! The O'Connor Road block party is tomorrow night but I have a baseball game. I probably can hang out before than and get back in time after my game. Batting .333 on the year. Pretty happy about that!  And for the big news! Next Thursday I'm leaving to Hungary to see some family. At first I was pretty bummed to go back there but now I'm alright with it. So there won't be any updating from July 29th to August 8th I believe.

      All I can say is 'wow'! That movie really changed the way I view our government and President Bush himself. We really do have no reason to be in Iraq, September 11th in a way was really Bush's fault, and we live in fear almost all the time because of false accustations being thrown around in the media. See the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about. &nbsp; I hung out with my friend Nick from New Jersey. Didn't really do much. We went to Taco Bell and hoped to find some people to play basketball. I didn't get a chance to play because I went to the movies. That was my day.

      It's been over a week since I last updated my blog. Nothing much has happened since then except that I am finally hitting over .300 for baseball and last night I slept over my friend Jimmy's house to watch the Century 21 Home Run Derby. I had my money on Sammy Sosa but he didn't even make it into the 2nd round. Hopefully tonight my parents will let us stay over here at my place to watch the All-Star game. Go American League!

      Wow! Tonight was fucking amazing! And I'm still a little fucked up too. After a few boring hours at my grandmas house, I came back and met up with Joe, Tom, and Jimmy and we went to Chris' house. I drank like 6 beers and a few wine coolers in like 10 mins. I'm still a little messed up from tonight but I am able to write this post. I met this girl there who happened to be my friend's little sister but I couldn't recognize her. She was only 13 years old! I could of sworn she was older. She looked good and I tried to get with her a few times but nothing happened. She was too drunk and young so it didn't feel right. Jim's mom took me home and here I am now! Woo! Good night!

      Well, the holiday weekend has arrived and I probably won't be writing or doing much. So I'm gonna take a few days off from writing. On Tuesday however, my friend's dad is taking us to Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey and I'm pretty sure I will have lots to tell about and maybe a few pics of us on Nitro. God I love that ride.  Happy 4th of July everyone!

      It's been a few days since I last wrote in here. My trip to upstate NY was pretty boring. All we did was see this shabby trailer house that we all knew my dad wasn't going to buy. Then when we came back, my dad bought me a 23" Sony LCD HDTV widescreen television. It was so cool. We then learned that it couldn't be wall mounted so we exchanged it for a Zenith 23" LCD HDTV Widescreen television that can be wall mounted. On Tuesday, I got really sick, probably caught it from my mom. I was worried that I was going to miss the Yankee/Boston game the next day which I was really looking forward to. Luckily I was feeling better and I was able to see the Yankees beat Boston 4-2. David Ortiz can't field a ground ball for shit. Way to help the Yanks win Dave! Today I'm playing sick so I don't have to umpire tonight. Don't really feel like doing it. I'm out for now, until next time.

      Nacho's back, Nacho's back, Nacho's Back.......ok, 'Without Me' by Eminem is a good song but is a little played out. Well anyways, I'm back in the good ole' United States. Boy have I missed it. All around it was a pretty great trip. We left JFK International at around 11:20 and got to Budapest, Hungary at 1:30 local time. We stayed in Yugoslavia for about a week and meet up with some family. It was ok, but a little boring for the most part. My dad would talk to my relatives and old friends while I sat there doing nothing. I can't speak/talk Hungarian. After we were done seeing relatives, we went to Hungary and stayed at a 'Hotel Forras' in Szged. It was pretty cool. Nice and fancy hotel too.  We just hung out there with my aunt and uncle and kinda just toured the city. Nothing more. We left on August 8th and here I am today.  It's great to be back!
