      Yeah ^^ I am tired. Saw an Airshow Yesterday. It was pretty cool. I got some cool Navy, Army reconition. i would hope that my brother would be proud. Well...I would hope. Who knows. i don't and quite frankly I do't give a rats ...uh yeah you know the rest.  I Got to see Canadians jump outta planes. that was cool. Got to sit in a canadian ww2 plane that was fun too. I Have a really really sore shoulder and leg area though. Makes me insain with pain. And I am burnt to a crisp. I am so excited too! Ken sama is comeing down to see me. its nice. i donno I am just on cloud nine. I love him so much^^ Its just...yeah. You're tired of reading about my love life. But i'll tell you how many times we have moved in my lifetime.....32.....32 times and 3 schools. i can never be sure if i ever see or stay anywhere very long. lived in Tennisee moved to Arkansas moved back to Tennisee then back to Arkansas and from there up to Illinose. and that was all before I even started school. From there we lived there for about 8 years but continues to move in town. It was a small town so i am surprized if we hadn't lived in each house at least once. Well from there we moved to kansas where i had the fun o living through absolute boredom for 365 days. and then we moved to Missouri. And thats that. thats ll the info you'll ever get outta me. I am just gonna gotake a lavender bath now....and soak my ackeing back arms shoulders etc etc etc....

      Now i have a light to  go to...in this insain world. A flash light but a light none the less. I love my books...the ones I write....my light in the darkness.my writeing keeps me going I guess you could say. Escapeing to my fantasy world of a fox demon named Kaia and Shikyo also a Fox demon. Obviously Kaia is the erogant one. A strong pride and a soouless and heartless. Yet destained to beccome the greatest fox that ever lived. but shhe still must deal with her past. horried and jaged with her having killed her phycological bother ,that killed her parents, and came after her hher only choice was to kill him. but that first taste of blood fuled thhe flames. She would then slaughter billions.  But it was what happened prior that aided to her snap.  her brother abused hherr ,hit her, forced  her to fight.  Kill mortals and witness things nno chhild couold  or should. Thhis storyy is my llife....I write it every day. The relation ship grows between Kaia and Shikyo so does the sinnce of  unreality. Its all a complicated mess at the moment I guess only an excentrric onne suchh as myself could understand. Mew...who knows.  Its a mess. but then...thhe darkness. School ... there is a sickness goinng around you get a horrible cough annd you are sick for months. The whole school is frreaking out annd jaming mmeds down our throats....I hate it. its just hell...as far as i am conseredd. Then you hhave those people whho think I am 'depressed' . It annoys me to thhe brink of innsanity.  God...people...*rolls eyes and sighs* wwell annotherr day...anothher pain in the butt...

      Have you ever thought about why things turn for the worst at the worst ttime? Everyday that thought crosses my mind. Yet..it all seems like another bump in the road to me. Nothing is ever the same arounnd me sometimes. like at school it seems surreal to me. Like it couold all fade away like a drream. Disapear in the light of the sun.  i donno I am having one of those days ya' know. Insain huh? lol. Yes It is oneof thoes dayys that youo can't think...can't focus....just wish for the world to go away.ugh...I don't wanna go to school i wanna sleep and talk. lol  thats all I do nnow!!! amazing how twisted things can be. well its late...I better sleep.

      Latly there has been nnothing. School got out last Thursday annd i have plunged. my link. My only way out to theh world the thinng i hate and yet love at the same time is gone. I amm stuck only in my room. I go downstaiirs only to get water. I hardly eat. I can't understand it. I just stay in my room. Nothinng more. I have only been in the way of everything.  my parents don't listen they don't care.  my brother dosenn't ccare. it all sucks. no one listens nno one cares. I have just dug myself alittle hole and layed in it praying for silence Sweet, subtle silence...I havenn't talked mmuch. I give enough souond to know that I amm not mute. nothing I do is good enough. I can onnly hope to talk to Ken. I feel better then. only one who ccan make me smile. thats it. I just feel darkness....Ii am going now....bye....but know this:  life is sweet death is peaceful its the transition I fear.

       I donno why but I have locked myself in my room. my only means of anything is school and this computer. And school is ending tomorrow. Ken is keeping me alive that much i am so thankful for. I can't have anything else to live for.   i work so hhard to keep myself afloat and I have nno idea what to do sometimes. Hell I was so lost I fell down the stairs 4 timmes to go get water considering its the only thing I come out for asid from tthe bathroom. I feel kinda bad. ken is working so hard to get down hhere and please my parents I just don't know what to do. I wanna help hhim so much and I want him to be comfy but he tells be not to worry. but ya know i alwways do...what can i say i think alot. I always think School where i am suppose to think I don't think at all...strang huhh?  i donno I pull back to myself only talking to a few people. god I hhate this. it just kills me to be thiis way  bbut what the hell can I say I always think and I am just worried as hell about Ken. i know he loves me alot and such but i am always just affraid thhat its just gonna go away and i'll be alone again. I mean you'd think hey no big deal just another guy I mean why should you care well I do care. So much and I just have this pull at my heart when he is sad its like I have to be there to help him and make it better, or when he is mad I feel like I have to be too and i hhave to help him in anyway I can. And when he is happy I am just on air. I have never been so hhappy in my life. When I feel that I can't go on anymore and its just too muchh I just think of Ken. I am telling you people he is keeping me alive!!! My drreams are always so nice nnow. i am just la la la now. I get to talk to him atleast once a nnight so that puts me up in such a better mood. yeah.  I do feel somewhat better now. I am not gonna post all my doubts because well somme of them I like to keep to myself. so long have I kept trust and hopes locked away but now I only keep a few so HA!!! You been told fool1!!! As you can plainly tell i just got done talking to Ken thats why i am in a better mood SO HAHAHHAHHAHHAHHAA!! I am iin a bounccy mood and I am out of my little hole but something later may pull me down but I am gonna pull myself out cause I love Ken so much i knnoww he would want mme tto be happy and want me to never doubt hhim so thats damnn well what i am gonna do!!! So yeah....better go now ggotta get stuff done before hhell breaks loose.....

      no title yet...just an idea.   "What is life? What does it mean to live in a world of terony?" This thought,these questions often crossed Lara's mind. She never answered. She would sit in class doodleing in her blue cheap notebook she got on her birthday a year or so ago. She would never use it for school. Only to doodle and write. Her dreams...her ideas....her stories. this little notebook with the blue cover and the chocolate stain in the bottom left corner. Such a little thing could mean so much to her. Life lessons passed over her brown haired head. Some might say she is  bit of an air head. But Lara was about to learn the lesson that would change her forever.  It all started.....    " LARA!!!God lara get ....whew...over here...."  Cassie stoped at mid step catching her breath chasing after Lara. Lara turned in a cool fashion and offered Cassie a hand up. "Whats so important that you have to chase me down 8 blocks?" Lara had a soft yet errogant voice. Most everything she said sounded like she was being mouthy, but cassie knew better then to say something. "Well...oh man....ugh...hold on I need to catch my breath...oh..ok much better." Cassie grined and begain to explain everything. " ok ok ok hold on a minute. A new boy moved here a day or so ago and he looks like the boy I know from the pictures in my scrap book from when I lived in Alaska? Cassie...might I sedgest you get some help." Cassie looked at lara with a sour look and continued to babble. As they rounded the corner to Cassie's house Lara stoped dead in her tracks. Something had caught her eye. Something so dear to her she had almost forgoten how dear it was...her promise. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Well thats alittle tid bit. It goes on for a while. Kinda angesty and such but um yeah. well I hope you all enjoyd reading that.   And to Ken... Thank you for comeing down. It means the world to me. I'll stand by you through thick and thin and I know you can bring happiness to me. Don't ever doubt that. I want the world to know I love you so so much and that I hope to god that you will be ok and never leave my side. I love you and I will sacrifice everything to be with you. Remember that. Bee strong for me...please...
