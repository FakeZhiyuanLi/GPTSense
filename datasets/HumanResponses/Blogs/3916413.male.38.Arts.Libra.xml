      On the three hour mad drive from Bangalore airport to Mysore past the crowds of people, ox carts, sari clad multicolored motorcycle divas, I had my first experience of deep devotional prayer since arriving in India. The fact that the subject of this prayer was for my own selfish desire to survive does not diminish from fervor which I applied to my devotion. We did in due course arrive at the hotel. Since then I have been guided through more a more traditional puja at a Temple to Shiva where after circling around the Lingam Stone, holy water was thrown into my open eyes and red powder spread on my skin. I have been assured I am now immune from small pox and duly blessed.  My first meeting with Guruji was good and meeting up with the small international community of yoga students has been great. I look forward to practice, Sanskrit classes - daily aruvedic massage and lots of work deepening and refining my art which has been flowing from my heart since arrival-   WELCOME TO INDIA DAVID

      Life in Mysore is simple, slow yet filled with intense imagery and powerful yoga practice. I wake up here at 5:00 am and get to practice after a cup of tea at about 6:30. After a long unhurried time doing full practice I meet other at Tinaís place. Tina is a local Indian woman who has a cafe of sorts in her home for students to eat. We have coffee or tea and chat. I often stay there for a time to paint in my sketch books. The rest of the day is spent either exploring the region or relaxing. I spend part of every day drawing and painting from my imagination and studying Sanskrit, chanting and the Yoga Sutras. My Sanskrit/chanting teacher is Lakshmish, who informs me I still have much work to do in order to be perfect in my studies. He is very strict but in a good natured Indian sort of way. I calculate that if I continue to progress in Sanskrit at the current rate I will have some competence in ten years or so. The weather here is beautiful. Often students spend the day lounging at the pool at the Southern Staró a large hotel nearby, or sometimes touring around on our scooters. I'm trying to get in as much study and relaxation as possible before returning to my hectic New York schedule.  Guruji seems in good health. He led two classes by himself last Thursday and Friday and besides falling asleep during a couple of postures (and we all of course hold the asana until he wakes)óhe still seems quite vibrant for a man of 88 years. He went though the class last Thursday and adjusted every student (about 70 people) for dropbacksówhere the student drops backwards and Guruji has to hold the weight while you touch your head on the floor and than grab your ankles. He is full of laughter and light and wisdom. Today is sunny and warmóI will probably go to the pool and also spend some time taking photos of some of the roving bands of pigs or the cows blocking traffic when they decide to sit down in the middle of the street. There is a Ganesha Festival going on and folks are carrying around shrines of the elephant headed god. Life here is wonderful and surreal. I leave the south in a week and a half for the north where I will visit Delhi and the small town of Rishenkesh ñ Indiaís "yoga capitol"ó  Until then I wish you all peace, love and light.  OM SHANTHI DAVID
