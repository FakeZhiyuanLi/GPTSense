      Ok, so I was hoping to get some writing done yesterday. That didn't work. And now I have a different problem. I have some time, but I have too many things I'd like to post.  Weird how that happens huh?

      For the last three years I've worked Monday to Friday... today I have to go in on a Sunday. I really  love  hate working Sundays. But it'll let me catch up with my blogging.

          &lt;sent via my  phone while in a meeting&gt; Just a quick note, my roommate got me a copy of   urlLink "Battle Royale" , the movie, last night. He found a used copy of it in  urlLink Chinatown  somewhere.         &nbsp;     I've never been so  excited about a movie. I can't wait to watch it... most likely at some point  this weekend. I'll post my thoughts once I've watched.         &nbsp;     If you haven't read  it, do so. It's kinda like  urlLink "Lord of the Flies" , except modern and kicked up a  notch in the way that only the Japanese can do. (Man I love that country, more  on that later.)&nbsp;&nbsp;         &nbsp;     Here are some links at  urlLink Amazon  and  urlLink Chapter's  .         &nbsp;     Go read it!  NOW!!!

      Alright, I really do equate the  urlLink iTMS  with the second coming. No word of a lie, this is one technology offering that I am 100% behind and would love to be able to use.  Anyway, I was playing with iTunes this morning when I stumbled onto "Celebrity Play Lists". Wow, what a great feature. Not in the cutting edge kinda way, more in the it kinda funny kinda way.  Essentially this option let's you see a "Mix Tape" that a musician would make. Guess what, two very startling things came up. Musicians a) listen to the same crap as everyone else and b) they make crappy mixes like the rest of us.   I found an article on  urlLink Slate  that waxes eloquent much better than I can,  urlLink give it a read .  I agree with the author... especially Thievery Corperations list, it's pretty sweet. Oh, and I actually like the Thievery Corperation.

      Now I'm not a big fan of Phish, however, having them leave the music scene is a little weird.   Trey Anastasio (of Phish)  urlLink posted on their site  yesterday:   ...we all love and respect Phish and the Phish audience far too much to stand by and allow it to drag on beyond the point of vibrancy and health. We don't want to become caricatures of ourselves, or worse yet, a nostalgia act...   I can't help but wonder, if The Grateful Dead have stopped touring and now Phish is no more, who will all of next generation's hippies follow? More importantly, who will the current breed of hippies follow? These are pretty important questions when you think of all the ramifications   Packs of roving hippies with no purpose is a pretty scary scenario.  So, in the hopes of helping Northern America in this time of crisis I turn to a proven scientific method in hopes of finding the next "Grateful-Phish". It's called  urlLink Amazon .  It's mostly common knowledge that if you like a certain band most of the time you can go to  urlLink Amazon  and find out what people who like that band also like. It's that cool feature so wittingly refered to as "Customers who bought this title also bought".... In Phish's case.... it seems to be Phish. No seriously... look:     Alright, so science having failed us, we are in big trouble. Please leave your ideas for the next Hippy caravan sensation. Maybe with your help, thousands of hippies will have a place to chill to.   (My vote is Snoop Dogg, think of it, you know it'll work. Have a brownie and it all make sense.)

      I'm not sure if everyone knows, but some huge news coming out of Singapore today. The Singapore city governement has finally lifted a 12-year ban on chewing gum.  However, this new freedom does carry a new set of rules, as per the  urlLink CBC News Article :   Those wanting to indulge the decadent habit will have to give their names and produce identification. And gum will continue to be available only at pharmacies.  Wow, this seems like quite a step towards the world-wide utopia I've been wishing for.  This  urlLink artist  should be thankful that he can now exhibit his art in Singapore.  Here's a sample:  Yeah, that's gum.

      The Vancouver Something-or-other has a report about the new Napster.ca.  urlLink  Right Here   I don't know... it seems like the only choices we have North of the border is  urlLink Puretracks  and now  urlLink Napster.  150, 000 songs VS. 300, 000 songs is not bad... however, no Mac support. Puretracks only has Windows Media files, and Napster has no Mac support at all.  urlLink Scroll to bottom.   When will  urlLink Apple  release the  urlLink iTunes Music Store  in Canada?  There's lot's of speculation...  urlLink  this is the last thing I've heard.   Just proof that Canada is not an important (more likely profitable) market for Apple... That's probably why we don't have an Apple Store yet. *Sigh*   Oh well, at least in the GTA we have  urlLink Carbon .

      This is too funny, as I was posting the last post I ran the spellcheck that's included by Blogger (very useful, saves me from looking stoopid most of the time). This came up!     I didn't make this up! "blog" and "blogs" also came up. Funny.

      Ok, I've received some emails from some of you telling me that leaving a comment on here requires for you to sign up and get your own blog. While this is good for the Blogger people in a way it is also bad for the Blogger people because some of you will never use these accounts for your own blogs, or are really bad at remembering logins and passwords.  So for those of you who now have blogs you will never use and anyone who thinks they may do the same, as a public service I will show you how to leave a comment anonymously.  Are you ready? Alright, see below a post is a link that says "X comments", (BTW- "X" is the number of comments left, think algebra.)You need to click that first. It looks like this:    Ok, so this should take you to a comments page. At the bottom of it is a link that says "Post a Comment". You need to click on that link. SO you know it looks like this:  Alright, so now you're on a page called "Comment Sign In", here's where things seem to be getting complicated for everyone. So take a deep breath 'cause what I'm going to explain is complicated and kinda abstract. Ready?  Alright, there should be a big blue button that says "Sign In", if you had a Blogger account this would be where you would put your sign info, this is not what we want. Where we want to go is just bellow, it's a text link that says "Or Post Anonymously" that's where you want to click. For those who are still lost this is what were looking for:     I believe you guys can handle the rest by yourselves. I believe in you all, so godspeed and good luck.  ** It is to be noted that the "you" in this post represents anyone but Cam... just to clear things up.

      ... we had a bit a power outage. Actually, it was more like a power cut really. My landlord had forgotten to pay for  urlLink Hydro , for a few months it seems. It's weird that he could forget something like that, but if you knew Norm, you wouldn't be surprised.  But that's not why I'm posting this. Yesterday kinda reminded me of the " urlLink outage " we had last summer. Which in turn made me think about how I am totally dependent on  urlLink electricity  and how  urlLink I am better prepared  for no electricity than the  urlLink average Torontonian , yet I'm still dependent.   I find that dependency is a weird thing. Sometimes it's bad (ie:  urlLink heroin ,  urlLink nicotine ,  urlLink cherry flavoured Kool-Aid ). And sometimes it's just necessary (ie: air, water,  urlLink Victoria Secret's catalogue ). But in any case it sure makes you feel like ass when you are stuck without any of them, makes you feel insecure.   All this to say that the power was out in my place yesterday, and it took me most of the day to shake that weird insecurity off.

      So I've been pretty impressed with  urlLink Michael Moore  for the last year or two.   urlLink Bowling for Columbine  cemented a lot of the things I felt about the States and  urlLink North American culture . It was a documentary that made me appreciate being  urlLink Canadian , and did nothing to make me less snarky about being so.   Now  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  is out in theatres, which is good because it seemed like it wasn't going to, and then it had such a hard time getting there. Umm...... Or did it?  The message in the movie I'm sure is sound. But the more I think about it, everything that led up to it's release seems a little weird to me. Here's some facts and theories I have, I think even Moore would appreciate this:  - Roger & Me, Moore's first commercial documentary, grossed almost  urlLink 7 million dollars . - Bowling for Columbine grossed  urlLink 58 million dollars . - Moore has a tendency to create news worthy press. - Is familiar with guerilla tactics / creative solutions to get his message across (just watch the documentaries). - Disney loves to make  urlLink money .  - Bob and  urlLink Harvey Weinstein  are not averse to making money.  So here's what I'm thinking. Knowing that Fahrenheit 9/11 could easily out-gross all of  Moore's previous films if marketed properly and that Moore has had very good success creating "buzz" in the news in the past, a decision was made to to create as big of a 'buzz" they could. Now whether or not Disney really did not want to release it is still up in the air. I have many arguments going both ways.   1) Disney being scared of pissing off the Government? That seems backwards to how governments usually bend over acertain amount to kiss large corporations asses. Disney counts it's money in Billions of dollars. Putting them in league with such biggies as Time-Warner and Chrysler.  2) However Disney is always trying to keep a wholesome family, piss no one off stance on everything. Well at least it likes to keep scandal down to a minimum and not piss off American parents too much. (Think Pocahontas).  That being said it created some good pretty good press for Moore. The movie winning Cannes isn't too much of a surprise, it would have done that whether or not the movie was creating a public stir.  The second part that smells fishy. The Weinstein's buying the rights for the movie from Disney and releasing it themselves. I am quite sure that the Weinstein's are quite nice people, with hearts in the right place. However, the fact that they did this is strictly financially related and less "for the good of mankind". After the Disney and the Cannes things, if I had the money I would invest in the movie. Shit the Bush family might have done so also. That might be pushing it.  The bottom line is that the subject of the film alone is enough to create a "buzz" in the media. Add to the mix a some scandal and uproar during it's release and Fahrenheit 9/11 can't be nothing more than a success. Spiderman 2 put covers on all the  urlLink bases of every baseball game one day , that's marketing. Creating a  urlLink fake cloning company website  to make a  urlLink bit of a stir  for the film  urlLink Godsend , that's marketing. The marketing of a movie has to someone match the film message or story right... you don't market English period drama at McDonald's (The Pride and Prejudice Happy Meal, now with tea!).  So I guess after this long winded diatribe, all I'm saying is that everything that happened after the filming of Fahrenheit 9/11, that the sum of all it's parts seems to me to be such a perfect marketing campaign. I think it is so cleverly done that it will even draw people who do not agree with Moore, just so they can disagree with it. And from a business stand-point, I think it pure genius.  I'm going to go see it next Saturday.

      Ok, so I'm working a new shift at  urlLink work  now...  is that too many instances of the word work in one sentence? I dunno ... I work four 10 hour days and I get to take Wednesday off now. It's awesome... I really like it, it's breaks up my week nicely. It was getting to the point that by Thursday I was burnt out... no longer a problem.  Actually that's not the point of this post actually. Well it is but it isn't...On Wednesday I did some self-metitation (read as drinking  urlLink low-carb beer  on my patio) on the status of things in my Universe right now. I came up with some good stuff.... and you know what? For the first time in a long while, I'm pretty much happy with me right now... It's messed up. Losing some weight,  urlLink Atkins  baby I love you really I do, and the positive side affect of renewed energy are surely responsible. So I figured since things are good, so let's make it better (cake made, proceed with attempting of eating it too... in this case,  urlLink low carb cake  though).  So here's what I decided, my soul sucking  urlLink job  has been stunting me creatively (I signed a contract, the soul sucking thing was in there, I needed the money. Hey, what am I to do?). So way back when, when I was at my creative best...  is that too many instances of the word when in one sentence? I dunno ... I used to do all these things daily that would keep me on my toes... write a diary daily, sketch at least an hour a day, read a lot, essentially immerse myself in different medias and sponge as much of it as I can.  So consider this my new diary, and this my public affirmation to get back into a way of life I enjoy, creatively, professionally and .... Um.... Astrophysicaly? (I have no idea what that means... anyone?)

      Alright, so I'm neglecting my blog... not good I know.  My problem of late seems to be two things, 1) too many things I want to talk about 2) not enough time to do stuff.  Crap, remember when we were kids, we spent whole days doing nothing. When I was a teen, I slept alot, and did very little else and thought I was soooooo busy.  I wish I could take all that time I wasted and put it into now. I have so very little time. Those who know me know I have tons of things I'm doing... but never enough time... strange, time... I digress.

      This is a few days late, however I have to share with everyone how absolutely cool the Fireworks on Canada Day were.   We found a sweet patio in Ontario Place, had drinks and chilled and watched an awesome fireworks display. What is it about fireworks? They have this weird affect on people no matter what age. As I sat there I was looking around every once and a while at the faces of those around me. Everyone had to same look of amazement and bewilderment.
