        just finish praying and i felt the joy and the pace in me .... as i read the bible on Mark 10:46-52 is the story of blind Bartimeus. this man is blind since the day of his birth den when he herd Jesus the son of GOd is coming he cried out.. the people warned him to be quiet but he kept on shouting "son of David have mercy on me" nd it caught Jesus attention and called him . blind bartimeus threw aside his garment, he rose and came to Jesus.       as i read this whole verse is hited me when i sw the faith of Blind Bartimeus he keep on and on shhouted out for GOd mercy but i was wondering in my whole life of my christian walk did i ever tell someone about the faith of GOd i have no nv...and as blind bartimeus threw his garment i felt like each time i come before GOd i always place my burdens, stress and all this upon myself and did not really go and lift it up to GOd den i realise i should really threw this garment(stress, burdens) away and just come before God transparent yup,....
