      What a day, LOL.  Well, I went over to Jamie's house today; and me, her, and our friend Patrick hung out for awhile. Not much to do, but set around and act like a bunch of idiots, LOL. We walked around and talked for a bit; but I had fun. I acted like I was cutting myself and shit, so yeah... LOL.  I'm so fucking tired. My stepdad is sleeping, and my mom's watching T.V. {God is in the T.V.}, so I can't listen to music... dammit. I just need to hear something soothing and relaxing, to get me ready for bed. Must... sleep.... gah...  I need to work out. I really, really need to work out... but I'm just too tired. It can wait until my brain has had a proper cooldown, LOL.  I want to go and sleep forever, but I want to wait up and talk to Jamie... I didn't think I could fall for another girl...  Hey, I have a few sites for you to check out: http://www.shiversofhorror.com- A great horror movie related website; focusing on my personal favorite series, Friday the 13th.  http://www.religionisbullshit.com- A great athiest website http://www.raptorman.us- A zombie lovers wet dream.

LOL  Yours, The Dope Fiend    There's lots of pretty, pretty ones that wanna get you high- But all the pretty, pretty ones will leave you low and blow your mind...  - Marilyn Manson,  The Dope Show

      I should probably introduce myself. My name is Benjamin Ingram; I'm fifteen, and from a little town in the middle of fucking nowhere; Dupo, Illinois.  You probably know a kid like me. The ones that sit in the back of the class, dress in black, and are outcasts in general. They listen to music that scares you, and you're afraid that they'll bring a gun to school and shoot a hole in your head. Don't worry; most of us are generally harmless, and just looking to be loved/understood by our peers.  My birthday is Jan. 22, 1989. I'm 5'10, and my weight fluctuates between 160-180 pounds. I've got short hair, it's usually spiked, and sideburns; although I plan on growing it out in the near future.  My favorite band is Marilyn Manson. Yeah; I know Goths consider him a poseur and metalheads consider him a pussy, but he's neither. Yes, he's a shrewed businessman; but he has a depth to his lyrics unmatched. Other favorite bands of mine are Rob Zombie, In Flames, Killswitch Engage, Deicide, Nine Inch Nails, Children of Bodom, Arch Enemy, Bittersweet Symphony, Alice Cooper {before he turned Christian, that is}, Kataklysm, Bauhaus, Depeche Mode, and Type O Negative. I HATE Korn and Slipknot. Rap and pop sucks ass; and modern punk is little better {although I do have an appreciation for older punk rock}. I love dark art, poetry and horror and science fiction movies.  I hate people that are all one way or the other. I can't stand people that are either constantly pissed off or constantly happy. Life doesn't suck so much that you have to hate everything and appreciate nothing; and life has nothing in it worth being happy all the time. Life might not be all pain and sorrow, but it isn't all rainbows and puppies, either.  Nor can I stand shallow people. I normally don't listen to rap; but I was riding in the car with my aunt, and she turned on her "hip-hop" bullshit, and I heard a song about shoes. "Air Force Ones" or some such shit. How much more shallow can you get? Does a particular brand of shoes invoke so much emotion in somebody that it's worthy of writing a song {and I use the phrase loosely} about? If it does, that's completely shallow.  Two other things I can't stand are people that try to enforce their will on other people, and those that judge a book by it's cover, so to speak. I'm an athiestic Satanist; I'm not a strict follower of LaVey, but I agree with his principles. This doesn't mean I worship the devil. I don't; as I believe in him about as much as the Christian God {meaning, I don't}. I simply believe he represents the admirable qualities in humanity; namely, will power, self reliance, rational egotism, etc. He makes a good role model.  Which leads me to my second point: People judge me by my cover. I come off as emotionless and uncaring to most people, but I'm not. I've been used and abused so much that I act like this because I don't want to be hurt anymore. To the people that let me open up, however, I think I show that I have feelings. Strong ones at that, as I'm a very emotional person.  As for girls, yeah, I like them. But I hate how some guys use them for sex; and I hate even more how girls are willing to be used. Sex is good, sex if fun; but it shouldn't be the focalpoint of a relationship. It's just another drug used by people everyday; along with religion, television, etcetera ad infinatum. I can't stand girls that just want a "good time" and "fun" and don't want to actually FEEL emotion. I've met some of them and even fallen for one once; and I was hurt deeply by it. Never again.  My current girlfriend is Jamie Kern. I just got out of a seven month rocky relationship with a bi-polar girl whom I won't name out of courtesy. It really hurt me; so I think I'll take it slow this time and not fuck things up {as per my norm}.  I'll post more later; but seeing as how it's 7:00 in the morning and I've been awake since four yesterday afternoon, I'll have to get back to you on that one. I'm going over to Jamie's today; should be fun.  Oh yes, if you'd like to contact me for any reason, my e-mail address is psychotic_metalhead@hotmail.com. I look forward to talking to you.  Ta,  Ben     A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb, a pill to make you anybody else- But all the drugs in this world won't save her from herself...  - Marilyn Manson,  Coma White
