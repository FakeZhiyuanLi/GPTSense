      Answers to The Sportsguy  These questions came from Bill Simmons and were intended for Ralph Wiley. I intercepted them and will now answer them for RW. http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/wiley/040517  Is Phil Jackson the most overrated coach of all time or the most underrated?  I would have to say that Phil is the most overrated. In all 9 of his championships, he has always had a the best player in the league on his team, and has always had 2+ NBA First-Teamers. Like a wise man once said, "you need 3 things to win: horses, horses, and horses." NBA coaching is overrated.  Where does AP's elbow to KG rank on the Memorable Moments of Violence in NBA Playoff History?  I will say #3, behind the ankle biting incident and therefore every Heat-Knicks game, including when PJ Brown body slammed the nicest guy in the league (Charlie Ward). I also considered Malone's elbow to C-Webb's mug on this list. The reason AP-KG gets so much love in my book is that these guys were teammates for like 6 years.  Why are Euro's so soft?   They play a different style over there, I guess.  I think the Spurs question was rhetorical  Duncan or KG?  Duncan. KG is a total freak, but Duncan can score like no other in the post, which is invaluable in the NBA.   Why haven't the Knicks retired Bernard's number yet?  Because they're complete idiots. Bad answer, I know, but I hate that franchise.  Does Kerr have a chance to be the best hoops analyst ever?  YES. He's got the experience/credibility, but he's also got broadcaster attributes. He's not wearing purple suits like Michael Irvin (or Craig Sager), and there's something about him that you feel like you can relate to.   Wade or Carmelo for the next 15?  Tough one. Can I have both? I guess I'd take Carmelo because I think he's more durable. I think Wade is a little bit brittle.  Is Kobe's focus a little freaky on his court/game days?  Yes, everything about the man is a little freaky at this point.  Sorry, I don't watch the Sopranos. I'll answer any OC or 9-0 question you want though.

        The Purest of All Athletes  Competition comes in many forms. There is the competition for food in the animal kingdom. The competition between collegues fighting for their financial lives in corporations. Competition between siblings. There is competition on the grandest of stages in the Olympics and professional sports. To this day, the purest competition I have witnessed is that of young athletes.   I had the opportunity to witness a junior high track meet yesterday, and I was blown away by the passion and drive of 12, 13, and 14 year old athletes competing against each other and more importantly against their own best selves. Young boys and girls leaving every ounce of energy on the track, then finishing with clenched fists and loud hollers. Pure competition is competing for no incentive other than the right to compete. Take into consideration this story...  A young, smaller than average seventh grade boy competing in the mile run against 20 other boys. After the first lap, he is behind by an estimated 40-50 meters of the leader, yet the determination on his face is that of an Olympic sprinter staring at gold. After two, he is behind 60 meters, still showing the eye of the tiger. After three, he has fallen behind by an incredible 70 some meters, in the middle of the pack, yet he is running a different race. You see, to this athlete, there was no one behind him or in front of him. There was only three numbers written in red ink on his left hand. He crosses the finish line, looks down at the inside of his left hand at his personal records and lets out the most emphatic fist clenching, "YES!" that you could imagine from a shaggy haired pint sized seventh grader.   He had just set his personal record. He didn't finish 8th in a field of 21, he finished 1st against his own best self. The purest form of competition.

      Bird Droppings  This post is in response to the following article:  http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&id=1818517  One of my long-time idols Larry Bird has just embroiled himself in a huge controversy. I don't know if his comments deserved to create such a stir, but then again, it is about race, and that word always conjures up emotion. It wasn’t like Larry Legend called Japanese people “Orientals” or “Japs” like our good ol’ buddy Bill Parcells, but he did stir the pot. He said that,  "The one thing that always bothered me when I played in the NBA was I really got irritated when they put a white guy on me.” Why does it matter what color of guy guards you? In the “White Men Can’t Jump” world of basketball, the white man has always been disrespected. That is, every white man except Larry Bird. He gave un-athletic white guys everywhere hope. Then, Our Savior Larry goes and disrespects all of us. He did make some good points, but to say something like he felt “disrespect” when a white guy was sent out to guard his is ludicrous.
