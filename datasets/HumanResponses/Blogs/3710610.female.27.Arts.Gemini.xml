      Citizens of the small town of High Springs were surely entertained when 3 crazy girls skipped down Main Street. Why you may ask? The girls were none other than a trio of cosplay-holic cousins dressed up as Shrek, Princess Fiona and Gingy "Do you know the muffin man?" Gingerbread Man.  The girls had previously made an appearance as the beloved Shrek characters at High Spring's historic Priest Theatre and were then asked by the owner to come back to the next showing of Shrek 2. The girls did, but were almost attacked by a hyperactive blonde little girl (who kept pulling on Gingy's gum drop buttons, lifting up Fiona's skirt and asking Shrek where did he leave Donkey at). The girls ditched the theatre minutes after the movie started and decided to take on the streets instead!  "I thought, maybe some hillbilly on a truck will shoot us with his rifle, but let's do it anyway", confessed Mayleen, the leader of the pack, "but people reacted in such a positive way! We got smiles, hand waves, hoots, thumbs up, honking car horns as a nice reward and even a guy who was putting gas on his car asked us to take our picture!"   To some people these girls might have acted like crazy nerds...but to them it was just another unusually usual fun way to break from the boredom that threatens to slip into their lives. Like I always say: "Why be normal?"

      If you want to make it in [Dimension_M] you must at least try to learn the language. Check new comments for new words and phrases in Mayleenese.   Good luck! (^_-)v

      6.24.2004  Life is full of surprises...like the surprise visit we had today when a crazy horse running wild wandered into our backyard... I grabbed my camera (and almost got run over) but I did manage to take a few shots of our uninvited guest. Check this one out!     I spent all day at home today sewing the FLCL group costumes...they're finally done!!! Yeay!!! \(^o^)/ While I worked, I listened to two of my new favorite movies: "I'm With Lucy" & "Win A Date With Tad Hamilton"...I love them both so much...I'll probably rave about them tomorrow...too tired now...I must go to bed. (=_=)zzzz     6.23.2004  Has anyone heard about 'meetups' or Meetup.com? I have. I found about it coincidentally as I was on one of my online searches for something else. Anyway, the whole deal about meetup.com is that through it you can join monthly 'meetups' in your city for any topic of interest that you may have (e.g. Japanese Language meetup, Cosplay meetup, Filmmaking meetup). Naturally, I was so excited and happy at the possibility of meeting others who would share common interests, so I joined. But I forgot that I live in the Gainesville area. I joined meetup.com last year and all I've gotten is emails of canceled events because not enough people sign up for them. For the same reason, my summer Japanese course at SFCC got cancelled...I had to return my unused textbook at Barnes & Noble... I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! \(~o~)/   6.21.2004  I've been wanting to start one of these blog thingies as a mean of staying in touch with my friends all around the world for a while now. Somehow, I never got to it, until I saw a friend's blog today. I thought it was so cool! Anyway, I'll do my best to report to you any exciting news and/or events that might happen here in my dimension, so bookmark this web page and STAY TUNED!!!   (^_-)x Love & Peace!

      Sometimes I wish I could go back to the days where I was a little more naive than I am right now. Ignorance is bliss...Knowing what you want makes the road very narrow. But "that's the way the cookie crumbles."

      We've spent this whole week in intense production getting ready for the next convention in Orlando. My back hurts (from bad posture?!) because I've been sitting for so many hours straight...while sewing I've listened to movies the whole time...listening to favorite films and those that I once bought a while back and haven't watched in ages...so, if I keep quoting movies on current entries to this blog, now you know why.  I know...my life is total excitement these days...it'll be worth it.

        Seven years ago I was working as a wardrobe assistant in the film "The First of May" while attending Film School. During the production I met many interesting people as well as known and unknown actors. One of these unknown actors was a little boy&nbsp; from Marietta, GA named Dan Byrd.&nbsp; "Danny boy", as I used to call him,&nbsp;played the lead role for the movie and proved to have great&nbsp;acting skills. He also possessed a such a sweet and&nbsp;very humble spirit. I saw him last at the premiere of "The First of May" back in 1998. In the years that followed, I heard that he had moved to LA and landed a recurring role in the TV show "Any Day Now". I was so happy for him.&nbsp; But you can imagine my surprise&nbsp; when I searched&nbsp;for him on IMDB.com and learned that he was making a movie with Hilary Duff! This past Friday I had the opportunity to watch him again in "A Cinderella Story"...I almost cried...he's&nbsp; too cute! I know it might sound silly but I grew so fond of him when we worked together in 1997 and I always knew inside of me that he had what it takes to be in Hollywood movies. I'm so glad that he's making it after all these years...I'm sure this is only &nbsp;just the beginning. (^_^) Good luck to Danny!!! Many many more successes and blessings!

      Ladies and gentlemen! I proudly announce the arrival of my new cool & good looking Australian  guy! (^_-)hehehe Don't get too excited! I'm just talking about Barbie's new Australian boyfriend (the one with the cool shades). I couldn't resist when I saw him at the store and just had to bring him home with me where the rest of the gang welcomed him into the family...looking at my beloved dolls I got nostalgic, so I dressed them up and gave them their own shelf in my room. (^_^) Behold the cool people of whom I write stories in my head!     From left to right: Kale Taylor & Miki Hamasaki, Joel Lurhmann & Sashi Mehta, Derek Taylor & Lynn Martin-Taylor, Yara Garcia & David Ashley, Imogen Wells & Jaden Lawrence. Sitting: Mara Robles & Callen Pierce.  On other news... I also bought No Doubt - The Singles album...and been listening to it like crazy... (^_-)\ I really like "Underneath It All". This song makes me smile so silly. (*^_^*)  I finished the Yubikiri neko hats to take with us to the convention this weekend. Evetzie helped me out a lot...Arigatou gozaimasu! (^_^)v We've been quite busy trying to get Yubikiri's new episode done before we leave for the con. I guess I'll spend all day tomorrow adding the SFX and music...we're also designing the logo and mascot of our new cosplay related enterprise which my mom will be heading...details coming soon.

      Today I honored the memory of Marlon Brando by listening to my "Don Juan De Marco" movie soundtrack. I think that was the first time I saw him acting in a movie when he played Dr. Mickler, Don Juan's psychiatrist, a.k.a. Don Octavio de Flores. To most people Mr. Brando might be the eternal embodiment of the Godfather, but to me, he will always be Dr. Octavio.  And speaking of "Don Juan De Marco", I have to say that this film is also in my movie collection. A movie that depicts how I dream life to be. The movie also has a killer theme song: "Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?" by Bryan Adams. This song absolutely captures the essence behind romanticism, but it's also so true. Guys! There's much knowledge of the female psyche to be learned from this song, so here it is:  To really love a woman To understand her  You gotta know her deep inside Hear every thought  See every dream N' give her wings -  When she wants to fly Then when you find yourself  Lyin' helpless in her arms Ya know ya really love a woman  When you love a woman you tell her  That she's really wanted When you love a woman you tell her  That she's the one Cuz she needs somebody to tell her  That it's gonna last forever So tell me have you ever really  Really really ever loved a woman?  To really love a woman Let her hold you  Till ya know how she needs to be touched You've gotta breathe her  Really taste her Till you can feel her in your blood And when you can see your unborn children In her eyes Ya know ya really love a woman  You got to give her some faith  Hold her tight A little tenderness  Gotta treat her right She will be there for you,  Takin' good care of you Ya really gotta love your woman...  *Sighing. Wishing. Hoping. Praying. Someday. (-.-;)*
