      Well the one thing I was worried about the most is over. The cheerleading competition which was yesterday and we came in 2nd. I'm so happy. All our hard work payed off! The gurls from one of the teams was so nice!  Anyways I always have a date for prom! It's my friend Sefton and I couldn't have picked anything better to go with. He's such a nice and fun and loving guy. But we are just going as friends lol just to let anyone who reads this know lol. So now all I need to get are my shoes and I'm ready for prom which is next week! I'm so excited. It's going to be the best night of my life.  Nothing to exciting went on today. Went shopping and got some new clothes and all that. But I did see this guy I was like in love with the other day. Let me tell you he still looks just the way I remember him. So anyways now I have to go and do some TR so I can have one more thing off my mind! Chow  P.S Caleb there will be something about you in here next time promise! lol.....laaaaates ;)

      Well I just made one of these things up because I wanted to put a simple comment on one of my friends post thingy's. But I guess now I'll just use this as my writing online journal. It's better then the one I had before anyways!  Anyways I was reading a bunch of my friends writings on here and it's amazing at what people think and write and what there views are. He always seems to amaze me and always shocks me with the things he says. But I guess thats what you get when you only talk to someone over the Internet and don't live everyday life with them and hang out with them. He always makes me thinks tho. With everything he says. It's amazing cause alot of people don't make me do that and he's one of those people who can just do that! So be happy Caleb cause this entry has been mostly about you.   It's also very amazing how you can feel so close with someone by just talking to them over the Internet. I mean I go with all my problems to him and he always seems to listen and make me feel better. I think that it's about time I take a road trip and go and see him! lol...He's a totally amazing person and we have alot in common. It's weird very weird trusting in someone you've never met before. I even feel closer to him then I did to his friend. But ohh well whatever. Anyways Caleb lol enough about you and how great you are. I don't want you to become so into yourself and thinking your the greatest thing alive lol.   I haven't been doing much this Monday morning. Just reading Caleb's entries and catching up on his life. I have been so busy I haven't been able to talk to alot people I usually talk to. Which isn't cool. Cause I'm losing touch with my best friend and Caleb and AJ and just alot people I don't get to see everyday. It sux but all needs to be done so I can graduate and all this. So i've decided instead of using this to rant all the time I'm going to use this to let ppl read about my life and day so that can be caught up in my life.   Well this weekend was May 24 and let me tell you did I party Saturday night lol. Friday I didn't go out so that I could be ready for Saturday. Then Crystal and me went to the pit where the party was. we set up our tent and started drinking. I hung around with my friend Tab most the night. We have never gotten drunk before together and let me tell you best time of my life. I had a great time chilling with friends and not worrying about anything. I swear to god tho I hurt my ankle so bad. It still hurts. Anyways our tent got soaked inside which was really shitty. So we went to a friends house and slept there which was awesome but we barely got any sleep. And let me tell you Sunday morning was not a good morning for me. Headache and stomach ache and felt like I was going to puke any minute. So we went and got the tent down and while drinking wow almost puked lol. Anyways then we came to my house and got dressed and fixed up a bit and then drove our friend Chris home and then we went and picked up our friends Sara and Bretny because we had to go and do some gurl things that needed to be done. Then we came home and Crystal left and I did some stuff and then went to bed at a very early hour cause I was tired. Needless to say I got 12 hours of sleep last night. Which I needed. So when I woke up I went on here and have been on the computer the whole morning just fooling around and reading Caleb's entries. And now I'm doing this. So that was my great weekend. Not as great as I wanted it to be. But good and thats all that matters.  So now I'm just waiting for my friend Matt to come back on to see if he is going to come over later today.   You know I just realized how it's so weird how people change and mature in a matter of months. It's true tho. It happens. You, yourself, don't realize it but alot of people, your friends, realize it. It's weird how it happens. I've noticed alot of my friends smartening up and realizing party life isn't the only life. Altho let me tell you it's a great life. As long as you make your teenage years rememberable thats all that matters. Let me tell you mine will be. Everyone around me is growing up including myself and it's scary. I'm not ready for the real life. I'm not ready to face reality. In highschool you have all this protection and your friends and it doesn't matter about the real world cause your just a kid and next year I have to face that. I won't have protection, I won't have all my friend being there everyday. I won't have a routine of going to school everyday and having to listening to teachers and having to do school work. I know I hate it now but I'm going to miss it. I will be alone and having to make my own decisions and having to do everything for myself. But I mean I have to accept the fact that I'm older and it's abou time I take responsibility for myself. It's going to be hard but I'm ready to do it.   Anyways I'm listening to a bunch of my friends songs right now and you know what music is great. His music is great. There so many songs that can relate to you and your life it's weird how people you don't know can sing things and it totally relates to you. Anyways I think I've written enough for today. Chow!

      Well nothing to exciting has been going on. I've just been chilling at home and taking it easy. Yesterday me and Crystal went into Ottawa to drop her cousin off and then went out to supper and then went to Timmy Ho's and saw Bear, Jay, and Pope. We hung out with them for awhile and what not and it was pretty fun. I just got back from the store and what not and saw my ex bf Adam. He's looking really good and I miss him and I hope that me and him can sometime get back together over the summer. But thats about all I have time for now. Chow!

      Well tonight I went into K-town with a good friend of mine Tabb. She's awesome I can't believe I only met her this semester in Accounting. Anyways we toured around K-town which we both love doing and honked at ppl and were just being gay lol. We went to Timmy Ho's for a bit and then we went into Radio Shack and saw a good, hot friend of mine Luke. We had a little convo which was awesome cause we really never get to talk in person cause we only usually see each other at shows and he's always busy. It was a good convo. God he is so sexy! I can't believe he has a gf either lol. But as long as he is happy. Anyways I best be off now. See whats in store for tomorrow. Chow!

      Honestly when will all the drama stop with my friends and around this town? I swear you can never get away from it. Someone is always hitting on someone someone likes or someone is drunk etc. It never stops. I thought finally out of highschool and summer time where nothing matters and NO MORE DRAMA! Yah right summer time just made it ten times worse. Maybe I'll just move to a far away place where there no drama at all. It's amazing to cause we are all friends but yet still all this shit happens. I just wish for once we could all have a good time and no one complained about anything.   Anyways that concludes my morning this morning cause thats all I've been hearing about since I got up.   Anyways as for me and my best friend she came to the show last night and slept here afterwards and it was just like old times which was the best man. It's good things are going back to normal and all. We had a great time and are just working on everything right now. She realized how much I was hurting and how I was right lol. For once she listened to me man! lol...Anyways that should update you for now. I don't know whats up for today....show and then pit party maybe! So I'll let you know about that when I get back. Ohh and grocery shopping and anyone who knows me knows I love grocery shopping!   Chow!

      Well tonight was one of the most amazing nights ever. I went to a punk/metal show and saw the band that I like adore. Daggers Bearing Notes. They use to be Eleven Moves but the bassist left and now they have a new band which has different music now and all that but it's still good. They will always be amazing to me. I always feel like I know what the drummers going to play and what the beat is bc we click so well. Anyways we haven't seen most those guys forever and it was great seeing them all again and they all gave there cute hello's and waves.   Anyways then this guy that I like adore from another group, Springfield, was there and let me tell you amazing. He sang with the band and it was awesome. His scream is so amazing. It has such a good tone and tune, it's just Kaleb. We talked and kept giving each other the looks and everything and while he was singing he pointed at me which he always does. Anyways enough about that.  Graduation was yesterday and yes I'M FINALLY DONE HIGHSCHOOL. It was a sad night but yet awesome and it was great. I got pics my best friends and all and everyone just looked so amazing and good in there caps and gowns. Anyways so thats all over with and now nothing to worry about with school until the year after this.   So I just read something about my friend and some gurl and it actually made me jealous. I mean I have no right to be. He's not mine and he will never be but just sometimes I wish he could be mine. It's great that he is all into gurls and having relationships and shit. I'm happy for him but then theres the jealousy part. It's stupid yes, but I like him I really do and really theres nothing I can do about it. I guess he'll never know exactly what I feel for him. I mean I told him but theres never enough words for what I have to say him and what I want to say to him. My words just get all mixed up when trying to tell him and all. I always think I'm done telling him but theres always more. I guess I'll just forget about it. It'll never happen.   Anyways I think my mom is actually going to let me go to BC this summer which is so totally awesome in every way. I've been wanting to go there for awhile now and I can't wait bc I get to see Caleb and AJ is there all up for it and all still, if not I can just still go up and not see them. Anyways I'm going either way anyways.   Anyways I guess this is my post for tonight. Kind of upset, but yet very excited and happy at the same time and all. God feelings are stupid. Anyways Chow!

      Well it's definiatley been to long since I've wrote in this thing. So I've decided I'm going to do it everyday I can for the summer so I can let my friends know whats going on in my life. First of all I'm going to let you know whats happen.  Prom was amazing. My date was awesome and he won prom king I tell you I know how to pick them lol. The after party was even better. Everyone looked good and had a lot of fun. I finished all my exams and graduate tomorrow! It's all done now! It's sad tho cause everyone will be leaving in a couple of months and will be moving on. I'll miss them all but we are all going to try and stay in touch. The guy I was seeing broke it off last night but I'm alright with it now. It's not worth worrying about it. Theres more fish in the sea. My best friend and I are talking kind of again. We just have to work and rebulid our friendship again. It's going to be a long and hard process but it's worth it. I got MVP for cheerleading which is awesome man. I was so happy. Anyways thats about all thats happened so far.  So now it's summer and I've just been having fun and chilling. Spent time with the family today and tonight I don't know whats going on but I hope something is. I had a great talk with my friend from BC last night. We had a really good discussion about a lot of things in our lives. It made me happy and forget all about Matt. So I guess if I go out tonight I'll fill this out when I get home. Chow!

        Okies well good weekend for one but totally confusing. Guys can be so confusing at times and just send so many different vibes that are so&nbsp;hard to understand. I just wish I could like pluck into their minds and read their thoughts and understand everything they mean and what there trying to tell me. I mean just say it if you have something to say don't leave it in hints thinking the gurl will understand what your trying to tell her. JUST SAY IT! Then theres the part on their hints and thinking about what he meant by it. If he was just saying it to get into your pants or if he was actually telling the truth! Aghhhhhhh guys suck right now but I mean you gotta love them! So anyways this is how my wonderful weekend was spent!        &nbsp;    Friday- Went grocery shopping and saw Brendan and we chatted for awhile and then I saw Shane and Kaleb and we talked for awhile to. Got to the trailor and set up everything and played with my mom's friends grandchildren for abit and just talked and stuff with friends and all. Then Brent (this guy I knew from before) decided that he wanted to go into K-town so we went and got Timmy's Ho's. So we came back and went to see Josh Westover. Who was drunk as hell but funny. He's a nice guy. So then me and Brent decided to go back into K-town where we saw one of my old bf's, Brad,&nbsp;who I haven't seen in awhile, who he knew and we chatted and what not and he was looking good and he told me I look good to. It was nice seeing him! So then Brad drove me back to the campsite and I went to bed bc I had to work the next day. Which I barely got any sleep cause my dad was snoring all night!        &nbsp;    Saturday- Went to work which was a long day but got payed $184 which was nice. Then I came home and took a shower and headed back to the campsite. I took the kids to the park and played with them for abit. That night we had a camp fire and sang and what not and then Josh and his friend Jeff came over and joined us and man hilarious the two of them together. We were all laughing forever. Then Brad came and chilled for abit. Everyone else went to bed except me, Brad, Brent, Josh, Jeff, and Marcel so we decided to go to the park and chill there and we had some good laughs. Brad left and then we went back to Josh's camper and chilled there all night and drank and laughed and did card tricks and had a great night. Marcel was hilarious. We were laughing the hardest. Didn't get a wink of sleep all night!       &nbsp;    Sunday- So then early in the morning the 4 of us decided to go and get Timmy Ho's and what not and then went back to the trailor and chilled. Marcel and Brent went to play horse shoe's while Josh and me saw Lou and went to my trailor and had some breakfast. Then for the rest of the day we were chilling at a friends across the street and decided we were all going to go boating. Which was so fun and we swam and what not and had good laughs, altho I thought I was going to die with the way he was driving lol. Josh was going crazy all screaming and having a good time. So we came home and went to my trailor and got something to eat and to tell my mom I was going to Josh's. We got to his house and put on a movie and both of us fell asleep instantly. We woke up at 2 to Josh getting a cramp and freaking out lol.        &nbsp;    All in all it was a great weekend. My mom and brother love Josh which is very hard to believe that my brother likes him bc he never likes anyone I like or am dating, not to say that Josh and me are even going to get that far, but let's just say I'd like to see if it happens. We were together all weekend and had a great time together and we flirted and cuddled and touched and had fun. We are friends and I guess I really never thought of him as someone I would date but I guess right now I'm just getting to know him and seeing where things go and what happens. I'm not going to rush into this like I do every relationship. I'm going to take it slow. I mean for one right now I don't even know what he wants. He was kind of making hints at me that he wanted more but then he would say something else that would make me think. Were suppose to get together tomorrow night so I guess I just have to see how that goes.       &nbsp;   I want to tell him what I think about this but I'm scared he's going to run off. I guess I just think it's way to early to even say anything to him about how I feel. But then on the other hand what have I got to lose?        &nbsp;   It's funny bc my mom totally trusts him even tho he's a lot older then I am. He's 25. I mean I feel comfortable with him which I don't feel easily. Honestly age doesn't matter it's just a number. Gurls mature faster then guys anyways so really it's like I think like him bc gurls mature faster. He's mature tho at times&nbsp;and thats what I need, someone who isn't going to be stupid and retarded. I just don't know what to say to him. How to tell him what I think and what I would want, like where I want things to go. I don't know. I just wish he would say something or there was a simple answer to this. I wish things didn't have to be so hard. I mean I don't expect anything from him. I don't but I would like things to proceed farther and if we don't date that decision would be on his part. He's a lot like me and it's just different&nbsp;with him. But I guess all I can do as of right now is just see what happens. I hope things go well, maybe something will happen tomorrow. Chow and Laaaaaaates!

        Well yet another day to update this!        &nbsp;   Last night Crystal and I went to visit our friend Smitty. It was nice cause we hadn't seen him in awhile. We had a drink and chilled and talked and play fought a little lol. It was good. He's a real great friend to have.       &nbsp;   So today I worked in the hot sun which wasn't fun and then went to Cornwall to get a social insurance number. Now I'm bored out of my mind and am writing in this.       &nbsp;   Walter wrote me back and thank god he's cool. He didn't really care but were getting together sometime soon to chill and shit.        &nbsp;   Anyways this is to Caleb! I hope your having a great time and are loving your job. I'm missing ya and still waiting for that email!        &nbsp;   Anyways not much more to write so laaaaaaates and chow!

        So I haven't updated this in awhile so I guess it's about that time lol.        &nbsp;   Anyways my bf (well ex-bf now) decided that he would ignore me for a week so that I would get the hint that he didn't want to be with me anymore. Which I did get. So I called him one day to ask for him to come over cause I wanted to talk face to face about our relationship and shit. Then he called one of my best friends Crystal to break up with me. I can't even believe he did that. If he would have just told me that he didn't want a gf that would have been cool but you NEVER and I mean NEVER get her best friend to do it. He said he didn't think we were right for each other, that he didn't want a gf, and that he's a free spirit lol.&nbsp;He didn't want to hurt me and didn't want to be the bad guy but by doing that he just made himself the bad guy.&nbsp;The stupid thing was all along he was saying I love you and everything. Anyways so I was upset of course but I mean I deserve a lot better then that. Crystal took me out that night and we went to Timmy Ho's and went into South Key's to visit her friend Chuck which was hilarious man! We had a good time.        &nbsp;   Crystal and me also went to a going away party for my friend Salim. It was all the old gang and everything which was awesome cause I haven't hung out with them in so long. Everyone was drinking and swimming and it was pretty awesome man! Steve and Ryan were hilarious and just real drunk. We all had a great time tho.       &nbsp;   I got a new job gardening lol but I get payed 8 bucks an hour and only have to work Tuesday's and Thursday's 8-1, which isn't bad at all. My parents also bought me a car which is pretty awesome man! I'm happy about that man!       &nbsp;   Last night was the Mountain Pig Roast which was awesome. Everyone was there. We played volleyball for a bit then we danced for like the rest of the night and chatted and drank. I saw a guy that I had got with two years ago and he remembered me and we clicked again. We danced all night and just had a great time and he even put some kisses in lol. He gave me his phone number again cause I lost it. I don't know if this is going to turn out to be anything but it's just nice to have him as a friend. He's a cool guy. A very good dancer might I add. I saw Walter&nbsp; who was real nice to me and kept staring at Ian and me the whole time. I felt bad cause I guess he has/had a crush on me. But I wrote him an email and apologized and I hope we are cool.        &nbsp;   Tonight Tab and me went touring around K-town and had a great time. I saw Ryan Bruno which was a treat man lol. But it was awesome. Were going to hang out again sometime soon. She's an awesome gurl man!        &nbsp;   Anyways I guess that fills everyone in on everything thats been going on. So I guess it's chow and laaaaaates for now!

      Anyways it's another day to update this!  Wednesday-Did nothing. Just hung out with the family and shit and took it easy. But that night me and my friend Caleb talked on the MSN till late like always cause he's going away for abit. It was so good and fun and man he made me laugh so much. I've never laughed so hard in my life.   Thursday-Crystal finally got to come out cause she was feeling better. So before she came over I went to get Adam and we came back here and watched movies and then we went for a walk and what not. Then Crystal came and we went and got Jay and then went for another walk which was so fun lol. Then we came back here and Adam made us supper and stuff and then we watched a movie and drove them both home.  Today-Went into Ottawa with Crystal and visited Smitty which I haven't seen in along time so it was nice seeing him again and then we went and picked up his friend Floyd and drove them where they had to go man. Then we drove home and went to Jay's for abit and then she dropped me off here and then we and my brother and my mom did aerobics which was really tiring and now I'm chatting on here and shit.   So that should sum up the last couple of days. Chow!

      I honestly don't know why I'm writing this but I am for some reason. I've only been on one real date in my life and it was great but theres always been one thing I've always wanted to do on a date and thats go to the beach and watch the sun set and walk down the beach with our pants rolled up and walk in the water and hold hands and just talk. Then talk all night under the stars and just sit there and have a fire. I know it's prob. a lot to ask from a guy for a date but it's always been a dream of mine. I doubt it will happen at anytime but who can't hope and wish eh? I just think that doing that theres more bonding and more romance and thats what I like. Also there's no money involved and it's just something fun and romantic. To take me out on a date means romance and no money being spent and just having an all around great time and getting to know each other. Theres so many feelings that I still have to feel and by doing something like going to beach and what not would I think bring out those feelings. I've never really had much romance in my life, and I'm a very romantic person, it just feels like I've been deprived of it. I also wish that one day I could have someone who would do anything to get me and just love me so much that everyday with them would be perfect. I've figured out that I'm a person who needs a lot of love. It sucks sometimes, but then again I like it at other times. It comes in handy. I just hope one day that I can come back to this post and say I have done that and I finally have romance in my life. Chow!

      Man I hate when old feelings come back for someone who you think you've been over forever and then all of a sudden one day they just come back. I hate when theres nothing to can do about them but just let them go away in time. But I guess just talking about him and his gf and seeing pictures didn't help in that case. It just brought back memories of us and how happy we were and the way we use to be. I mean I'm not going to say anything or do something stupid bc believe me I'm happy with Adam, it's just old feelings that I guess I really never got rid of and just really didn't go away cause I locked them up and expected them to go away on there own without me getting over them. So I've realized that I have to get over them myself instead of locking them up inside of me for them to go away on there own time. It just hurts hearing about them but I've always been there for him and I'm not turning my back on him now. I know when I'll need him he'll be there for me no matter how much he doesn't want to hear about my problems with relationships either. So here goes to getting over old feelings! Chow

      So anyways my Saturday was spent hanging around with Crystal, Jay, and Adam at Jay's house and just watching movies and chilling and having a good time. Bear and Sarah came over for a little while to. Couples it was awesome! It was a late night tho didn't leave Jay's till 4 lol.  Sunday was spent lazing around my house for abit and then deciding that Jay and Adam come to my house and we went swimming and in the hot tub and had a couple of drinks. Then we went to Jay's and watched a movie and ordered in some food. It was to good. Then it was an early night cause we were tired and had shit to do the next day.  Yesterday was spent lazing around my house again and then my best friend Kaits came over and we watched Peter Pan and it was the best movie of my life. I cried man! lol...The guy who plays Peter Pan to good-looking lol. Then we did aerobics and what not and then watched another movie and then we talked and head it to bed.   Today was another lazy day. I'm having a lot of those lately lol. Well cause Crystal can't have her car cause her parents need it so we really can't go anywhere. But then I did some more aerobics and shit and talked on the phone for abit. I wanted to go to the show tonight but I had no one to go with. I was dissapointed. But ohh well. So now I am updating you all on this and thats about it. So Chow!

      Anyways the person who kept writing to me that I kept replying to and wasting my time was my brother. So no worries about it now at least I know who it is. I was starting to get scared.  So last night we went into Winchester and saw a bunch of our friends and just hung out all night and talked and shit. It was actually a pretty good night man! We chilled with a couple of ppl we hadn't seen in awhile. The cops had to come and tell us to be quiet but she was really nice and just gave us a warning lol. Anyways thats about it.

      So what your saying your Adam Guy? Cause if you are you can't be bc Adam Guy and me barely even talk. You have to be someone I know very well bc in my journal it never says anything about Jamie, Kris, or Matt. Actually no I'm not using him, I'm going to stay with him bc I like him and we get along great thanx. Getting ass means nothing to me. Adam Deevy will never be useless to me. Actually no sorry I've never used a guy in my entire life, so you have no idea what your talking about and stop putting comments in like you know what goes on in my life. So who are you really?

      This is to whoever free_to_fly is. I have no idea who you are and if your going to make comments on my thing then please tell me who you are cause your being a coward by not saying anything. You have no idea what I go through everyday and what happens. I'm not the one who fucks off with the relationship the guys do. I'm very close to a lot of my ex bf's and theres nothing wrong with that. So what if old feelings come back, everyone has them. Jamie, Matt, Matt, and Kris are just really close to me now. I am happy with Adam and plan on staying with him for awhile now. So how about you stay the hell out of my business and let me deal with it and my feelings. The only three ppl that know what goes on in my life are Crystal, Caleb, and Kaitlin. So don't be putting your comments in my journal cause I don't want to hear them.

      Anyways since the last time I wrote in this a lot has happened. First of all after seeing my ex I called him that night and we got together with Crystal and Jay and watched some movies and what not and talked about how we miss each other and what not and we all just had a good time and he asked me out so now were dating which is what I wanted. He's the sweetest thing alive. So then last night I went over to his house and stayed the night and we talked and watched movies and it was a good time. I'm happy were back together again.  So tonight Canada Day. Crystal, Min, Jay and I went to South Mountain and saw all our friends there and watched the fireworks and then from 10 to 1 we sang songs on the bleachers and talked and danced and it was just awesome. Something I'm definiatley going to remember always. it was a good night. But the down side was that there was so much drama and Crystal and Jay were there together and Sarah (his ex gurlfriend, also our friend) was there and she's pissed at them and what not and was acting like she was two. She wouldn't stop complaining and everyone just wanted to have a good night but she pissed everyone off. Even tho she can't be mad bc her and J ended and she said Crystal could go for J. It's so stupid but the retarded thing is is that she is going for Clinton when Andrea has been trying to get with him forever. So she's doing the exact same thing she THINKS Crystal is doing to her. So she is being a hypocrite. Man were all suppose to be adults and what not. Whatever I ain't getting into the middle of this shit. Summer is for fun and thats all I'm going to have. Anyways tired. Chow!
