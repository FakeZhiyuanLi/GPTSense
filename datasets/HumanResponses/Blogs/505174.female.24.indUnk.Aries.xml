       I'm currently late for my appointment of yelling at the numbskulls who work in my school's admin system...but I thought I'd leave you all to  urlLink ponder over this . Don't ask...I was looking to help on CSS coding and I have no idea  how that  came up...somewhere along the line  someone  screwed up. More ranting later...

      Apparently it snowed earlier today. I know this because I see traces of snow lining my yard and my neighbors' yards....Weird, never knew it was coming. Heh. Well at least it wasn't a blizzard...  So I'm cleaning out my emailboxes and my computer file that I created exclusively for email-attachments to auto-DL to...and I realize that my friends send me waaaay too much porn. While I should probably be used to this, I'm not. I feel weird when they send me this stuff...it's like passing by a  severe car accident  on the side of the road...you don't  want  to look but you  have  to. It's like, "Um guys? I know you consider me to be 'one of the guys' and all...but,  in case you forgot :  1.) I am  a chick  2.) I hate almost all other chicks 3.) I  DO NOT  have a penis 4.) I  AM NOT  a lesbian and 5.) this stuff doesn't really do much for me."  I feel kinda honored that they're all sharing with me, but...*shrug* Porn's not really my thing. However, I will say that  a few  of the porn chicks out there are beautiful...and I wish that I could use  these few  as my subjects in my   REAL   photography.  Oh well. Yay for the Recycle Bin.  Heh.

      Ok, crisis averted.   I threw stuff, screamed, kicked the wall, almost pulled my hair out and threatened my computer with neglect; no upgrades, no games, no downloads, no nothing. I think the threats worked. I'm happy now...you all can go back to your regularly scheduled...well...whatever you are regularly scheduled to do right now.  One more thing...    THANKS PAUL!!!!   :D   ...and the peasants rejoiced.  ;)

      Alrighty, something's wrong with my blog and its pissing me the fuck off. The template got so messed up that I had to switch templates and then attempt to fix it back to the settings I had...but for some reason, something got fucked up along the way.  I don't know what the fuck to do and these random changes are severely pissing me the fuck off.  This fucking sucks.

      Hmmm....  I'm hoping the picture in my blog will  stay  this time...for some reason it works for a day and then just disappears. Weirdness. I'm hoping it had something to do with the server I was storing it on...  Oh well.   Let's see what happens.  *crosses her fingers*

      Did I mention that I suffer from insomnia at times? Last night was one of those nights when no matter how dead tired I was, I just couldn't fall asleep. So I wandered around the web and took all these weird tests, polls, quizzes, etc. Most of them come from the same site, so here...have fun...Yeah.  Did I mention that I was  suffering from insomnia and  very very bored ?

      Yeah...So I just got back from my workout at the gym. I feel...pretty damn good, considering my small fit of depression yesterday. I can still jog my 1/4 mile with no problem; my weights have increased and I feel like I accomplished something today. I found a couple of good blog sites earlier this morning when my insomnia acted up...I'm not sure if I want to add them to my rather large collection of links yet though. I'll see how I like them over the course of the week and if I'm still happy with them, I'll post them. It's not like I  know  these people, so they can run my gauntlet before I start "endorsing" them.   Heh. >;)  As if I was so damn important that my support would merit lots of people flocking to their sites to see what I like.  LOL!  Ah well, I can dream can't I? Yeah, I can, it's what dreamers do best and I know that I'm nothing but a Piscean Dreamer. Talking about dreaming, I found an interesting book while at Borders yesterday; it's called  The Dreaming Universe:  A Mind Expanding Journey into the Realm Where Psyche and Physics Meet  by Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D.  Pretty damn good so far; Wolf takes great pains to explain himself and I like his no-nonsense style of writing. As for my previously mentioned books, I finished  L.I.E.  by David Hollander   in record time...after all it was a pretty slim book and the way he writes; well, I just couldn't put the damn thing down. It was interesting, amusing and slightly disturbing...although there were times where I just had to laugh out loud. Really interesitng book. I'm still re-reading   Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time:  The Updated and Expanded 10th Anniversary Edition   -- This one's taking me a bit longer since some of the concepts aren't fresh in my mind anymore and I actually want to take my time while reading so I can fully understand what Hawking is saying.  So that's what's new in my life right now...Pretty interesting huh?   :D

      And so I was a bit depressed yesterday. The Victoria's Secret swimsuit catalogue came in and I was immersed in the wonderful world of beautiful swimsuits draped on equally beautiful lean female bodies that I will never attain no matter how hard I work out. It must be great having the lithe body-type, the fine bone-sturcture and the overactive metabolism that allows these models to have such lithe, lean bodies.   Damn them.   Trust me, it  sucks  having a bone-structure/body-type that would easily lend itself to be the perfect  linebacker  had I been born  male . Add in the non-functional metabolism and all the excess poundage of flesh that I'm carrying around...and...well...let's just say it was very tempting to run out and buy some chocolate to pig out on. Although I must say, I am proud of myself. I was able to get to the end of the catalogue  without :  »»» crying »»» throwing stuff »»» putting my fist through a wall »»» pigging out on whatever food i could find  >:Þ  Yeah...So, I'm just gonna hit the gym like I always do later on today and continue my fight to lose the excess poundage. I realize that I'll never have the body of a swimsuit model, but hell, I'll be happy if I could just  fit  into a swimsuit [sometime this year]. This...just... ROTS .  Heh.       That's it !!!      In my next life, I'm coming back as a fucking swimsuit model.  Either that or a superstar football player...If I'm gonna be stuck with the damn body of a linebacker, might as well get some goddamn use out of it.

      Tonight I feel like I'm detached from myself and the rest of the world.  Things make sense, but they don't -- the duality of life is hitting me hard today for some reason. I'm antsy; I need to get the hell out for a while and think.  I want to learn things, know things, study things that might seem out of character for me; I just want to  know , to use my intelligence, be an  informed  person. I find myself addicted to the History Channel, listening to 880 and 1010WINS, reading books that I used to read when I was younger [and ridiculed for being "nerd"] and yeah, I still read my Wall Street Journal [don't like it? screw you]. But I still feel like I'm missing the picture. I read the neat-o political crtique bloggers and find myself thinking, "Damn, I wish I understood what is going on in the political world so that I could argue these points right along with you and provide my own point-of-view." I watch others argue their points on IRC and idly wish I could join in. I'm sure that if I set my mind to it, I could figure out what's going on in the confusing and convoluted world of politics. I think this is going to be my next long-term project; teaching myself politics.  It's just that...I know that I'm a dreamer and that my creative mind doesn't like to be focused on such seemingly tedious topics for too long. That and the threat of the information overload that will come with wandering into the political arena freaks me out. I get  frazzled  just thinking about it...Yet, I still want to learn.  But I digress.  Tonight I feel like I'm detatched from myself and the rest of the world...and I'm not sure if I like this feeling. I think I'm going to attempt to find solace in a cup of coffee now...

      So...It's Saturday once again.  I'm breathing  slightly  easier [hell this semester is OVER!!!  WOO HOO!!!! ] but there are still some problems that are chasing me around...  The craziness of yesterday is nothing more than a bad memory now and I more than likely failed C++. Bleh. This rots. I still don't have a schedule [no one was helpful in this area, sigh] and now they're telling me that I owe them money. Bullshit. This is getting fairly ridiculous...  I'm so tired of this, I can't even rant about it.  I think I just want to curl up in a little ball and die.

      And right after that  awesome  final, right when I thought my day couldn't get any better....  My Sociology professor decided to allow my class to take home the final and work on it. After looking over those questions [and getting somewhat frightened...most of those questions were just off the wall] I was pretty happy that she decided that the final would be a take-home.  *dances around*  Yeah, my day was pretty damn good...  How was yours?   :D

      YES! YES! YES! OHHHH YES!!!  Yeah, I'm excited. STOP THAT! I know what you were thinking...guttermind...heh...S'ok!  I won't tell anyone.  }:)   So the Networking final was a piece of cake. It took me longer to transfer my answers from the test to the ScanTron than it took me to actually answer the test. EVEN THE EXTRA CREDIT QUESTIONS WERE SO DAMN EASY!!!! Yeah,   my A   is secured. HELL YEAH!  So I'm thinking about getting lunch and studying for my next final...Sociology. Knowing Professor Kelly, she probably threw in some tricky questions to throw us off....  Heh!  All I have to say is...damn that Networking final was GREAT!

      One of these days I swear I'm going to die laughing.   I mean this in a literal sense; I have a  touch  of asthma that really isn't  too  troublesome to merit me carrying around my inhaler  at all times ...It's brought on by excruciating excercise [e.g.,  if I tried to run  full speed  for a mile, I'd just collapse] and severe laughing fits. Yes, you read right,   severe laughing fits  . Anyway, I was in IRC [talking to pretty much whomever will listen to me] and something funny came up...Well...There's no real way to describe this, you'll just have to read it for yourself...

      Joy!  Things are going well today. I am feeling... content . The weather is beautiful [feels like springtime!], my dogs are happy, my internet radio station is being nice to me and playing a good mix of techo-industrial, ambient and "normal" techno...and even my new shampoo is good. Heh! It's the little things in life, it really is.   My mom's running around packing things for her trip. I don't think I've   ever   seen my mother so discombobulated in my life. To me, this is hilarious; I feel like I should be taping her as she runs around like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to figure out what to bring, what to leave behind...Really amusing.  I just can't seem to put down my new book,  L.I.E. ; it's really hilarious...I don't know what's worse, the fact that the characters in the book remind me of people that I have known over the years OR the fact that David Hollander captures the boring trials and tribulations of growing up on LI in the 80's so well...  Anyway, I think I'm going to finish getting dressed and find some lunch to eat. I just can't rant on an empty stomach...  Heh! ;)

      Well yesterday turned out to be a good day. The parts for my car came in and they wasted no time in swapping out the parts and passing her inspection. I got a manicure and a pedicure...my finger- and toe-nails are now a sparkly purplish-blue. My dad made me the  best damned cup of coffee   ever  this afternoon, right before I went to the eye doctor. My eyes checked out ok: my vision is still 20/20, 4 months after the successful LASIK surgery...even my left eye is still in good condition¹! My hair was trimmed, so now it can grow longer and those damn split ends are gone. I went to Borders and bought two new books...I could tell that my selections baffled the clerk, as her face just kinda collapsed in on itself:  L.I.E.  by David Hollander and  A Brief History of Time: The Updated and Expanded 10th Anniv. Ed.  by Stephen Hawking. [Wow, I remember getting the original 1988 ed. from my dad as a present...Yeap, you guessed it, I'm a nerd. *shrug* Whatever. ;) Makes me happy...Heh.] Yeah. And even though I spent the day with my mom, it was good. Surprisingly even  her attitude  towards me was pretty laid-back...Yesterday was just a great damn day.  Today, however, will be...interesting to say the least. My mom's going away for about a week. I'm ambivalent towards this -- I love my mom, I really do, but I have to be honest and say that I will breathe a little easier with her out of my hair for a week. On the flip-side though, she's gonna have to take a plane down to where she needs to go, and I'm   not too happy   with this, especially after everything that's happened recently. Yeah, I know, I'm probably just paranoid and worrying over nothing [yes, I am a worrywart] but still, I can't help but be scared that this will be the last time I see her. After all, I had a "last hang out" with someone who was in the WTC before everything went down and didn't know it...This freaks me the hell out. I still [to this day] wish I had said different things on that "last hang out", I wish things would have been better...Instead, things were so odd, so weird...But I digress. That's some ground I still can't tread right now; the wound is still raw. Anyway, so I   know   I'll be holding positive thoughts, sending positive "karma" and energy and asking my dead relatives, spiritual guardians, animal guides, angels, lucky stars and every other thing in that "great out there" to watch over my mom during her flight tomorrow and on the way back. Bleh. This is gonna really, really weird.   Yeah.  So if you're reading this, hold some positive thoughts for me, tomorrow...   :)   ¹ My left eye was the worse eye: -5.75 [This is a  horrid  myopic rating. Myopic = near-sighted] and needed more work done on it so that my vision could be corrected. As it turns out, my left eye was so bad, they couldn't even do the whole precedure on it; even though they corrected it to 20/20 during the first run, the doctors predicted that within 4 months my vision in the left eye would grow a bit fuzzy and another procedure would have to be done to permanently fix it. So far, it's been four months and my left eye is still at 20/20...My doctor is giving it another 6 months [a sufficient time frame] to judge if the procedure that was done in Oct would be good enough to last a lifetime. If at any point during these next 6 months my vision in that eye starts getting fuzzy, I have to check in with him again and they'll have to schedule an appointment for a second LASIK procedure to be done on my left eye.

      I rememeber seeing this awesome site of a company that was working on VTOLs for actual use. They were pretty nifty looking and I wanted one...but I couldn't, for the life of me, remember the addy for the site. Then it occurred to me that a friend of mine showed me the site and so I asked him if he had it handy. Voila!  urlLink VTOLs  that look pretty damn cool...and they're calling them "SkyCars".  I just keep remembering that commercial that was aired around the beginning of 2000...I  think  it was for a random phone company, but all I remember was some guy raving about when he was young they said that in the year 2000 there would be flying cars. And he kept repeating, "Where are the flying cars?! I WAS PROMISED FLYING CARS!!!"  Heh. Maybe if you remember it you'll laugh along with me.   So I went to the store and saw two of my friends that I haven't seen in a  loooooooooooong  time...Jon and Jenna. That was pretty cool; we played catch-up-with-each-other's-lives. LOL!  At least it wasn't as bad as when I ran into James Goroleski at Borders...now  that  was...Strange, interesting and weird all at the same time. Last time I saw him was in 1998 so...the catch-up game we played that day was pretty intense to say the least.   Never a dull moment :)  See? Not all the things I post are stark-raving-pissed-off rants!  ;)

      Today is a good day. I woke up hungry.  This may sound strange, but yes, it is a  good  thing. This means that my metabolism has kicked in for the day and is working properly. How do I know? I kept a 2-week food journal for my weight trainer so she could see what my eating habits were like. Each day I would write down what I ate, how hungry I felt eating it, what time I was eating and other such relevent things. I don't feel that hungry most days and becasue of this, I don't eat. This has always been looked on as " good " and worthy of praise in my family; especially by my mother. My trainer on the other hand, after looking over my papers, was none too happy. She told me that I seriously needed to change my eating habits. That, I expected, but not the explanation to follow:  1.) I am making the correct choices of food¹ 2.) I am not feeling hungry because my metabolism has shut down. It is not working properly because: --- a.) I don't eat enough² --- b.) I don't eat regularly²  3.) Even though I am eating the right things, I could help myself lose more weight by asking for "light", "low fat" things -- such as low-fat cheese 4.) It's good to fall into a timed eating routine but bad to fall into a food eating routine³  ¹ They are mostly healthy choices, although she would like to see an increase in my consumption of vegetables ² Because of these 2 reasons, my body thinks it's being starved to death, and so it stores everything I eat as fat ³  e.g. -- It's good to eat at the same  time  every day, but bad to eat the same  things  every day  This was the weirdest thing to hear: I needed to eat... more ??? But I can see the logic in that. There are days that I just don't eat a damn thing at all because I just  don't feel hungry ...it's obvious that I am not eating enough to keep my body going.    As I'm writing this, I'm getting hungry....I'll finish this after I get something to eat!

      ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH  Well that sucked. I had all  these nice stories and rants to post on my blog and the past 6 times for some reason they didn't want to post. WTF!? I guess maybe someone's trying to tell me something.   Heh.  Well, that's not gonna stop me from my usual ranting...So without further ado...   ;)  WE WON THE DEBATE!!!!!!!!! WOO HOO!!! I  knew  we were gonna win; we were prepared, we answered the questions, we we able to switch tracks and argue any and all the points they brought up...it was great!  That, and I really love the 5 extra points on my final grade. }:)  Well, registration for next semester started...and I'm still without a damn schedule. I brought a color-coded copy of my Academic Progress Report and showed it to my Dean...it was beautiful and easy to read. Blue for courses I've already taken, yellow for courses I am enrolled in currently and pink for questionable courses. "Questionable courses" being courses still on my sheet that I knew weren't in the curriculum anymore. It was kind of disheartening to watch him look it over and mutter things like, "What the hell were they thinking?", "Why is  this  on here?", "They  really  fucked up your sheet." So anyway, he re-labels things, switches things around and tells me what I  should  be taking next semester and sends me on my way. Normally it is  difficult  to create a schedule, but with a little creativity, some mish-mashing and 20 spare minutes, I can usually pull something together.  This  time around, however it is PURE HELL. I have tried  everything  to concoct a schedule using the recommended courses; no matter what I do, I can only feasibly schedule three of the classes nicely...the other two overlap. Now, unless I somehow get two of the professors to work with me as an Independent Study, this might work...but since  no one  in this school seems to be able to grasp the concept of an Independent Study, I doubt this will happen. God I   HATE   block scheduling. If you don't fit perfectly into one of the blocks it's "too bad, so sad, you're screwed." After an hour spent trying to make this work, I gave up and attempted to create a schedule using my normal means. Still...nothing fits. This is  ridiculous ...and I'm still without a damn schedule.  Finals next week. Those are always fun.   I'm pretty confident though; the only class that's really worrying me is C++. Oh well, what can you do...Hopefully he'll only cover structs and pointers...then I might actually pass...*snarl*. I want to hate that professor so badly but I can't...it's not his fault he can't teach. He's so oblivious to the fact that the rest of us don't understand a word he's saying...I wish Nagel was teaching this course. I know that by now I would have had a good handle on the concepts. Nagel uses the overhead projectors and creates the program from scratch in front of you and explains what each line of code does as he types it in: that was wonderful. You saw the line of code, he ran the program to show you that it worked and voila! You actually understood what the man was talking about. This one however...no good. No good at all. And apparently every semester students complain about his methods, that he can not  teach...and yet the man is  still here , teaching. Just goes to show you that those "student evaluations" questionnaires that we fill out every semester aren't worth crap.  ARRRGH. This is just rifuckingdiculous.

      Well, today was a pretty good day considering it all. Except for the fact that my "big brother" Glenn told me the story of how he had the worst day ever...Didn't think much about it until he explained that he watched as his friend from school died in his arms. She was in a car accident; he tried to save her but was powerless to do so. She gasped for air three times before coughing up blood...and died. That was so horrendous...What do you say to that? There is nothing you can say. After that whole story, things just became very numb, very grey.   Yeah.  Started feeling better when Nick IMmed me and made me laugh. :)    Then I went in search of the elusive prey named "Dinner" and found it in the local pizzeria/restaurant in the form of chicken parmigian, baked ziti with meatsauce and a salad. Yum. Yes, dinner was good; I'll enjoy the leftovers tomorrow. Finish the laundry, talk on irc, check on all the webboards/mailing lists I belong to, check email...attempting to push back the horrid thoughts of death to the back of my mind. Ah, routine. By tomorrow I'll be drowning in my normal schoolwork, so I will hopefully be ok...But for now, it's still fresh on my mind.  Maybe Nick will make me laugh some more...  I just really need a hug.  Yeah.

      Nothing like going to the gym to work out all of your frustrations. :)  Did a lot of legwork today and I found out that most of my weights were increased on Monday...ah, the joy! And I'm still proud of the fact that I can jog a quarter of a mile. While I realize that this may sound insignificant to the average person, consider the fact that 5 months ago I could barely jog 3 feet. This is a very good thing.  Now I just gotta take a shower, get dressed, finish my errands and then...God only knows.  I'll figure it out as I go along...Like usual. It's all about being spontaneous.

      ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!  I brought my car in for her inspection on Monday. No big deal. They couldn't pass her because there was some sort of problem with the axles. They said, "We'll order the parts; they should be in by Thursday. Give us a call at 9:30 AM Thursday and we'll tell you what time to bring in the car to replace the parts."  Ok fine. Again, no big deal. I called today at 9:30 AM on the dot; they tell me,  "Oh, only one part came in and the others are on backorder. Sorry. We'll give you a call a little later to tell you what's going on."  Lovely. I go outside to check the date on my inspection sticker. 2/13/2002. Wonderful.   So now I'm screwed.   I told my story to some people over IRC. One tells me that I should always go about two weeks before the sticker's up. Normally I do this anyway...Just this time it came up as a surprise. Go figure, I brought my car in   to the same shop three weeks ago   because of a problem with my alternator.   NONE   of them noticed that the sticker was about to be up soon...  *sigh* Never a dull moment. Oh well. I think I'm just gonna eat some lunch and then start on some of the errands I have to run...  ...I'll just have to be supercareful.  Bleh. This ROTS.

      Ahhhh, the joy of listening to my launchcast internet radio station. Complete with commercials every 10 songs...heh.  So apparently yesterday was  urlLink Get a Different Name Day ...So I decided to switch my name to "Catalina Jaguaravenwolf" for the few remaining hours of said "holiday". Heh. mIRC fun at its best!  So I'm already 45 minutes into Valentine's Day.  Feels like any other old normal everyday Thursday to me. I have to run some errands later on today...such as:  ¤¤¤ Bring my car into the shop for her inspection ¤¤¤ Go sweat my ass off at the gym to further my dreams of weightloss ¤¤¤ Drop off my B&W film to get developed ¤¤¤ Finish up some labs for C++ ¤¤¤ Type up my half of the report for the debate ¤¤¤ Other random things that my sleep-dep'd mind can't think of right now but will remember to do tomorrow  Heh, leave it to my dad to try to cheer me up on the holiday he knows I hate the most: he got me this really funny Valentine's Day card...Really amusing! Made me laugh my ass off for at least 20 minutes...IT was great!  So I think I'll actually disengage myself from the computer for a little while and go get some sleep...  Yeah, I think I'll be ok this Valentine's Day.  I'm holding onto this unusual Optimism for as long as possible...   :)

      Goddamn my Connectivity class is B O R I N G. I mean, networking as a whole seems to be pretty fun...but it seems that the power of vocal inflection is lost on my professor. Don't get me wrong, he's a great professor; it is obvious that he is very knowledgeable in his field and is able to break it down correctly in order to pass along that knowledge to even the stupidest student in our class, but believe me when I tell you that his unbreaking monotone will put to sleep even   the worst  insomniac case . Crazy.  So Registration begins tommorrow for next semester and I'm so lost as to what I'm supposed to be taking. I took a look at my Academic Progress Report [i.e. where you stand on your 9 semester journey to graduation] and apparently I'm going to be starting my 5th semester. I   love   transfer credits. While this gives me one hell of an advantage, it also hinders me; this means that I don't fit so well into their "block scheduling" and so they actually have to be  a little creative  and tailor-make a schedule for me. OF course, this all got shot to hell when they decided to rearrange and recreate the curriculum for my major last semester, but hell, what does that matter?    Switching rant modes; I hate this one kid in the Gamers Club. He's trying to subvert and undermine everything German and I have done for that damn club in the past 2 [almost 3!] semesters...It's infuriating! This....this... upstart  is pissing me off and everytime I look at him I just want to rip his head off. Of course this will never happen, but...I wish I could. I feel like screaming, "Look kid, we understand you want to attempt to be president and run this club, but it's not that easy. We've put in a lot of time and effort into it to try to give the student body   something and someplace   where they can just relax and not worry about things for their time off in-between classes and we're not about to just let that go, give it up and watch  YOU  mess it up!" Unfortunately, I can't..just yet. But the time is coming when I will. The next time he attempts his take-over...that's it.  ...And for something completely different, check out  urlLink "Jane Galt's" rant against spammers . Made me laugh [since I know where she's coming from] and also ponder: "Now why didn't   I   rant about it first!? Damn, too bad..." All I have to say is that she hit the nail on the head and her subtle sarcasm is great. Too bad that her point would be lost on the spammers if they even bothered to read it...  Anyhoo, it's 2:20. Almost time for Sociology class...   See you next rant.

      Valentine's Day is Thursday.   Tomorrow. *sigh* I hate it when these damn holidays creep up on me...  I still remember getting cards from my best-friend-in-first-grade Zachary Gazza throughout the years...Yeah. That used to be cool; I remember actually feeling special when getting those cards way back when. [Of course, when I was really little it was  his mom  sending the cards, but hey, I still felt special, LOL! After a while, once we got a little older, he actually sent a few himself...That was nice. Maybe done out of pity, I'll never know, but still...a really nice gesture.] As sad as it sounds, I kinda miss getting those cards. Of course I lost touch with him over the years...God only knows where he is now. More than likely he's getting ready to graduate college [like I /should/ be doing, but  that's neither here nor there ]. I don't know. Wherever he is, I'll remember him tomorrow, eat a few chocolates in his honor and hope things are going his way.   I'm ambivalent to this "holiday" now; even though the past few years of Valentine's Day were ok...bearable at the most, I sometimes still find myself dreading Valentine's Day. I guess it goes back to the whole trauma of being the fat girl with coke bottle glasses and braces that no one liked from second grade to...well...8th. [Yes, the dislike went further, but by 8th grade my glasses and braces were no longer an issue:  my glasses, thanks to plastic lenses weren't so large and the braces came off. Now, even the glasses are gone...All hail LASIK surgery! --But that's a blog for another day.] I never received those cheesy valentines from anyone...unless someone's mom wrote them out for the whole class and accidentally made one for me. You know the ones I'm talking about, I'm sure. They had cartoon characters such as Snoopy or Garfield complete with cutesy little messages that said things like: "I'm glad we're friends!" and "You're so special to me!" Eh, whatever. Old news. Still kinda hurts though, so...I always tend to feel my loneliest and most depressed when Valentine's Day rolls around.   Sadly, this is usually the time of the year when I pig out on chocolate, but... Not this year. Not after   all this work   that I'm putting into reshaping my body from this horribly overweight bag of flesh into something leaner, healthier, and more beautiful.  Maybe this year I'll get lucky and Valentine's Day won't hurt so bad....   Heh.   And...Maybe I should stick to what I do best and keep dreaming.

      All I have to say is that...for once...I understand what the hell the professor is talking about. I guess it's because he actually made the coding  useful  instead of using his normal theoretical coding rhetoric. I have to say; it makes sense now. If he had only taken this approach  since the beginning of the SEMESTER I would probably be passing right now with an A. But whatever. Bleh. Well at least I understand these last few concepts well enough to explain them to my classmate Jose...and actually have him understand it too!!!  [and the peasants rejoiced!]  Yeah.  Blaarg.  Class is OVER! WOO - HOO!

      Yesterday I was checking all the different blogs I normally read when I came across  urlLink this post  by Kyle Still. I read it over [as well as  urlLink corresponding article ] and felt the need to go to  urlLink VodkaPundit  and read the  urlLink original post  and all the different  urlLink comments  that were left there...Almost everyone was in agreement; except for  urlLink one guy  whose thoughts went against the grain. I don't know what to think about that guy, but I'll give him credit for having the balls to voice his opinion. A few other people ranted about what went down but they didn't hit me as hard; the exception being my  urlLink Nick  who also wrote down his own views on the  urlLink matter  [and as usual, got  urlLink straight to the point ]...I love him for that...  The sun is shining warmly again today and I want to go outside and enjoy it. After everything that has happened, I just want to tune out the world and live a little...  ....And since I didn't make it clear yesterday, [sorry Emily] it's the   tourists for whom the importance of the WTC just doesn't register   that severely piss me off;   the ones who can't seem to grasp   that NO, this IS NOT Disneyland and you should not be happily frolicking about and taking pictures. I  sure as hell can understand  the rest of the people [who like me] wanted to go down and see it, to pay our respects to those we knew [and didn't know] who lost their lives there.   Sorry about that.

      I finally had the courage to visit the what was once the WTC today; I think the warm sunshine helped me find the courage. That had to have been the longest train ride of my life. I walked out of the station, was blinded by the sunshine for a moment and then immediately stopped dead in my tracks when I finally saw the gaping hole, the wreckage, the cordoned off areas and the burned surrounding buildings. People just kind of flowed around me as I stared into that pit; the next thing I did...I surprised even myself. I walked into the nearest church and sat down to cry. When I finally regained my composure, I walked down and just stood there for a while and stared; I can't even begin to explain everything that was running through my head.  Although one thing I do have to say is...   FUCK TOURISTS  .    Explain to me how people can stand and pose and smile using NYC's still-fresh wound as a background!?     EXPLAIN THAT TO ME BECAUSE I JUST DON'T FUCKING GET IT.   I watched in abject horror as some woman posed,  smiling  in front of the memorials while her husband took a picture and then just stared blankly as she turned around and used the gaping hole as a backdrop. I looked around and saw others doing the same...My face must have shown my horror since no one had the balls to ask me to take pictures. I'm  glad they didn't  or else I would probably be in jail right now for supreme violence.  Thousands of people died  right here   and you're using it as a fucking tourist attraction!? The significance of what occurred here is obviously lost to you; even if I managed to beat it into your collective skulls your lack of respect is disturbing and despicable. I spit upon you and hope that one day you watch as others show no respect to your dead loved ones. That was  disgusting .   I found a spot to write something on the memorial...That made me feel a little bit better. I still wanted to chase that woman down and clock her in the head though; but I digress.   Yeah. It's been an interesting day.

      And suddenly I am reminded of the day I started my blog in the middle of my C++ class...The Randomness of Ravenwolf was originally called The Joys of C++ for about....20 minutes. Heh! Today the professor is away at some sort of convention and we have an awesome substitute...Professor Ron is obviously as knowledgeable as our actual professor  and  he has the added advantage of  knowing how to break down the material   to teach the damn course!  Excellent. I believe that I'm going to ask him to take the challenge of tutoring me.   On another topic -- Congratulations to the men and women who are graduating from the  urlLink NYPD Academy  today! I had the honor of sitting on the train with family and friends who were heading to the graduation; hell yeah, nothing like seeing happy and proud people on your way to school. The little kids were so excited as they talked about their brothers and sisters who were graduating; the adults were more subdued but their pride was still evident. All in all it was a pretty good start to the day.  Unfortunately, being that I  am  in the middle of class, this post has to be a small one...I'll fix it up once class is over. :)

      Back to the daily grind of school. I'm currently working on an ongoing project for my E-Commerce class. It's interesting and fun so far...Then again, I eventually want to start my own business so the tips and tricks I'm learning right now will eventually help me in the long run.  Switching gears for a moment; my Best of the Web email came in with an interesting article  urlLink about a quick-thinking father who saved both his son's and his own life from two would-be armed robbers . Reading articles like this make me smile with pride; yes, there ARE still some people around with good, old-fashioned common sense.   Well, I finally have both of my evaluation results sitting here in front of me...The fight for my weight loss and a healthier me is very difficult...but damn it all, I'm proud of my accomplishments! I created a chart that would make the results easier to compare; but when I posted it to the blog, it didn't come out as well as I had hoped. Oh well; I'll have to make a .jpg out of it and throw it up on a website somewhere so that everyone can see it. Heh. Yeah I know I'm obsessing over this but it is something that has taken over my life and I feel the need to share my results. Who knows? Maybe I'll inspire someone out there who has has it with dieting and yet wants to lose weight. [Well, I can dream, can't I?]  Talking about dreaming...I dreamed of someone last night whom I haven't seen since elementary school; well, that's a lie, since I've seen him every so often as I got older, but still...that was odd. I think there's a message there but I have no clue as to what this message might be; maybe I'll get lucky and I'll actually see this person sometime soon. I can only hope; once he was my greatest of friends.   Well I'd love to continue my ramblings, but I really need to get at least a little bit of sleep; these super-early mornings are hell. Heh. A small sacrifice on my way to two degrees.   :)

      In the wake of my vehement anger over small blog updates, I unfortunately have to be the hypocrite and do the same; please forgive me for the fact that my writing contains even less than normal coherence and logic...  ....I'm not emotionally with it right now after watching this  urlLink Tribute to 9/11  [thanks to  urlLink Mind Over What Matters  for having it in his links section]. If you're on dial-up, be warned: it's a large file, but well worth the wait. Those of you on DSL or cable have no worries, just watch it.   Yeah.....Just, yeah.  I need to go away for a while and contemplate things; get myself togethr.

      Blaaaaaaargh. The snow melted away and left a beautiful sunny day in its wake; there goes my snow pictures idea, but who cares? Maybe I can get started on a tan. Heh. I hate my damn allergies, I really do; I got my shots yesterday and I still feel like hell. All I want to do is curl up into a little ball and die; but since that can't happen I'll just have to deal. At least Chuck Billy's voice is soothing me...Blaargh. Damn all these meds, but if it will make me better quicker, I'll take as many pills as humanly possible.   Anyway, here's a  urlLink funny website  depicting the "secret diaries" of the characters in LoTR. Very amusing.    urlLink :D

I need a hug.  On an odd note: It's  snowing  outside...I guess the beauty of yesterday died when the sun went down.   Well, maybe later on today I can throw on 6 layers of clothing and take some pictures....

      Well, yay for going to the gym!  I had my re-evaluation today even though I'm sick as a dog and not feeling well; and I did surprisingly well! My trainer broke out the results of my first evaluation and we compared the results:  Old Eval: 3-min Cardio -- Pulse: 120 // Very out of breath 1-min Push-Ups: 18 1-min Sit-Ups: 18 Flexibility: Excellent  Today's Eval: 3-min Cardio -- Pulse: 106 // Slightly out of breath 1-min Push-Ups: 38 1-min Sit-Ups: 30 Flexibility: Excellent  I also did the Skin-Fold Calibration, but I'm not going to post that until I get the percentages. All things considered, I did very well. I can't wait until the next one...I want to see what I can do when I'm feeling my best!

           So I found out (about 3 mins ago) that I apparently hate guns. And because of my hatred for guns, my ex couldn't own one while we lived together. Heh. I have to say, I laughed pretty hard at that one; there's no need for me to do crunches at the gym today because my abs just got one hell of a workout!  Me: ¤ Involved with the Marksmanship Team in my old high school ¤ Managed three bulls-eyes the first time I ever picked up a gun [of course, after that it was harder....damn that beginner's luck! ; ) ] ¤ Wanting a permit to carry a concealed weapon ¤ Likes shotguns and rifles better than handguns  ¤ Would love to be a sniper [but that whole military training thing kinda scares me]  Heh.  Anyway, yeah. See previous post about the  urlLink gatling gun  that I want....but there's also a  urlLink handheld gun  that sounds pretty damn interesting....  ...but, considering all this, I "hate guns". >:)

      Apparently just to be spiteful, the weather outside right now is bright, sunny and beautiful -- in striking contrast to the frozen rain, slight sleet, 30-second snowfall and the ALL-FRIGGIN-DAY DOWNPOUR.  *sigh*  Well, at least it wasn't snow; I remember more than a few birthdays have been plagued with several inches of it. But better late than never, I guess! :)   At least my roses and daffodils are still pretty and happy.   I woke up very early today; I have no recollection of what I was dreaming about, but it must have been horrible. My body went into overdrive and I woke up...very scared...at 7am. I guess it's for the best that I can't remember my dream...Oh well. At least I can now get all my errands done  early  today.  On another note, there seems to be a new trend for gun-clubs. More schools are allowing their students to gather together and other "highly-unlikely" groups are also starting their own clubs [if you get the WSJ's Best ot the Web Daily email, you probably will recognize these]:   urlLink  Doctors for Sensible Gun Laws  [yes, I know it looks strange at first glance, but trust me, it  makes sense ]  urlLink Article: New on Campus: Guns 101 [Philadelphia Daily News]   urlLink WSJ: Who's Afraid of Chicks with Guns?   And yes, even though I posted this before, I still think it's good:   urlLink WSJ: Annie, Get your Gun...   Something else that got me thinking from the BoTW email...Someone needs to sit down with me and explain to me how the people at the Law School of Washington University can get away with offering a loan-repayment-program for all their graduates who get public service or government jobs but  urlLink refuses to help their graduates who continue on and join the military . This makes no sense to me; those who join the military are making a bigger sacrifice than those who get cushy government jobs. *shrug*  I don't know, but something just doesn't sound right with this one. Maybe I'm not meant to get it.  So with that sun shining through my window, I think I'm going to attempt to detach myself from the computer and get started on my day...  ...Then again, my addiction to my computer is very very bad... ; )

I also found out that my humble little blog is represented within  urlLink the picture of weblogs . Whee!   Well, it's been a loooooong [but very good] day, but I believe that it's naptime now.

      Well, about 10 minutes ago, my parents came in and sang happy birthday to me! Sometimes they can be so cute...  But it's time to go to sleep. I have to be up for school in 3 hours and 15 mins...  No rest for the birthday girl....Heh.

      Today just started out wrong. My mother was in one of her egotistical, argumentative, combatative and contrary moods. I was attempting to have a rational discussion with my father about what was going on with my day/night tommorow as well as my plans [or lack thereof] for this weekend. He has a conference to in the city and is staying there for the entire weekend; my mother figured we would all go there as a family. Apparently this was her idea of celebrating my birthday -- We would all stay in the city for the weekend; she and I would see this play called "Mamma Mia" while my father was in this conference and then afterwards we would go out to dinner. Then, the rest of the weekend would be devoted to whatever; shopping, sightseeing, etc. Now, don't get me wrong; I love my parents, I really do, but I have no desire to go to the city with them and be stuck with my mother for a whole weekend. There are other things I'd rather be doing...like have an asthma attack. Read a book...or thirty. Teach myself mechanics so that I don't get ripped off at the car shop. Continue to further my knowledge in psychology. Attempt to understand C++. Go back for a second dose of LASIK surgery. I love the fact that I was never asked as to what I wanted to do; it was just  expected  that I was going to go along with these plans.   Heh.  So of course, when I replied that I had no desire to go to the city and see these plays, etc., my father took this in stride with a shrug. He suggested that we all have dinner together in the city; I said, sure, just let me know where and when and then I'll meet them there. No problems. My mother on the other hand, started ranting and raving; there was no way  she  was going  to the city  just to have dinner  [gasp! the HORROR!]; any  country bumpkin  could do that,  SHE  was going to go and shop and see the play and have a good time. I shrug, say, "That's nice, enjoy yourself, but there's no need to start criticizing the fact that I do not want to go to the city." Wrong answer. She goes off, screaming. Apparently I'm a horrible person beacuse I don't want to be with the family. Sigh. I've been dealing with this ridiculousness for a long time now; normally I take it in stride, walk away, laugh...but today I snapped. I yelled back, "I am tired of this conversation. There was no need for your criticism. I'm going to be late coming home because I'm going to the gym after school. Now if you need me, give me a call; if not, I'm leaving."  With that I stormed out of the house, slamming the door behind me. It took me 17 minutes to get to the train station...  ...In hindsight I realize that this wasn't the way to go about things, but I'm tired of this. I'm tired of being a horrible person because I don't want to be attached at the hip with my parents. My father has no problems with this; he understands the fact that yes, I do have a life outside of them. My mother, however, has this clingy neurosis that the three of us need to be together, 24/7/365 or else we're not a family.  I'm tired. I look at my mother and sigh, recognizing some of her worst aspects are a part of me. I try my hardest to get rid of these aspects; but it is difficult.  «×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»   Humans are like clay.  From birth to kindergarten: it is akin to taking the new clay out of the package and softening it up, getting it ready for the future.  From kindergarten to the end of elemtary school: the clay is soft and has already started to take on a definite shape.  From elementary school to the end of high school: the clay has shape, form; it still pretty soft and many hands have left their mark, molding the clay into what it is.  From high school to the end of college: the clay has hardened and it realizes that it has been molded into something, but its final shape has yet to be decided.  Fro the end of college until death: the hardended clay tries to reform itself into the shape it has decided it wants to take, and attempts to smooth over the imperfections and fix the places where so many hands have left their mark.   «×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»   I am clay. I see my life, see where its trials, tribulations, experiences and people have all left their mark. I especially see where my mother has left her mark; deep indentations that I have tried to ignore; but it is impossible. I see where my father has tried to smooth over those indentations and realize that his efforts were in vain. My mother has way too many issues that will never be addressed and instead of dealing with them, she has passed most of them on to me so that she could have someone to suffer with. I realize this and I hate her for it, because now I have to fix myself, fix these issues that weren't even my own to begin with in order to live my own life.   I have to deal with the weight and beauty issue; the fact that, no matter how much I come to love and accept myself, on some deep level I hate myself because I will never be a tall, beautiful supermodel.   Thanks mom; thanks for throwing it in my face every day. Thanks for reminding me that I am obese and that I should try harder to get this weight off. Thanks for suggesting every single diet and "miracle pill/solution" that will help me lose this excess weight. Thanks for telling me that I'm not trying hard enough to lose weight and asking me why I hate to excercise when YOU KNOW that the opposite is true. Thanks for shoving all the pictures of myself from when I was younger and in better shape in my face every chance you get. Thanks for telling me that I should eat less and that I need more willpower. Thanks for NOT RECOGNIZING THAT MY BODY TYPE AND BONE STRUCTURE IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than those SIZE 2 VICTORIA'S SECRET BIKINI MODELS AND FOR SHOVING THAT FACT IN MY FACE EVERY GODDAMNED DAY OF MY LIFE. I already know that I wasn't genetically blessed mom; I really don't need you reminding me of this. Thanks for telling me that I'm lazy. Thanks for reminding me that I'm not beautiful and that I should wear makeup. Thanks for pointing out every blemish, pimple and scar that is on my face. Thanks for telling me that I'm destroying my face because I happened to scratch off some skin and it started to bleed. Thanks for telling me that I'm ugly because I'm not in good shape.   I'm tired of it all.

      One of Amanda's friends has an interesting website:  urlLink The World Through the Eyes of Glaceau ...I read through some of her writings and I found myself laughing...   ...She sounds like me.  Things that she has posted up there, I remember writing simliar pieces, along those same lines; scary.

      The E train. I normally don't think about my commute since I'm usually half-awake, but today was different; as I was drinking my coffee, I realized that they switched the Manhattan destination signs back to World Trade Center. I nearly choked; I wasn't prepared for seeing those signs...As I looked around, I noticed that I wasn't the only one who was taken aback by the change; a slew of other people looked somewhat lost, seeing the sign changes for the first time.   Almost makes me want to skip the E to Penn and take the 7 to Woodside...But the E is more convenient...Bleh.  First week of school. Whee! At least it's fun seeing everyone again and meeting the new victims...errr...first semester kids that walk around the building, wide-eyed. It's amusing to me; they are so lost in a school that only takes up three floors in one building. I can only imagine what their reactions would have been like if they started their first year of college at BU [like I did] whose urban campus is  urlLink spread out along a one-mile strip of Comm. Ave.  or even my second school,   urlLink SUNY Stony Brook's campus  which is sprawled out on a   rather large   plot of rural land. Heh. Three floors in one building is nothing, kids. But hey, it's their first year so I can't really blame them that much.   If you watched those of us returning students all gather together and get caught up, you would have thought that we haven't seen each other in   years  ...It was nice seeing soem familiar faces that I haven't seen in about 2 semesters. My first serious day of classes seemed to get off to a good start, considering that I will always have problems with my scheduling. [Damn their block scheduling! DAMN THEM! ;) Yeah, I feel a little better now, heh.] I've come to the conclusion that C++ will always be hell no matter how hard I try to learn what's going on. E-Comm is so damn fun; one of my favorite professors is teaching the course and  even the book  is interesting. Contemporary Literature...bleh. I took this course in Stony Brook under the name:  Poetry and Literature . Bastards! They didn't accept my transfer credit; I  HATE  that. Looks like I'm going to have to re-attempt to force these people to accept the credits. Why waste time re-taking a class that I have already earned credit for when I can use its time-slot to move forward in my education?   Anyway, I'ts almost 4:45 -- I think it's time to go home. I tire of Queens.

      So  happy St. Patrick's day  all you happy people out there in that wide digital landscape! Yeah, go have a pint o' Guinness on me!  [Or Killian's....or that Magner's Hard Cider stuff that I keep hearing the commercials for...]  HEH!  Looks like a  lot  of  other people  subscribe to WSJ's "Best of the Web".....my favorite article about the  urlLink new military uniform  keeps popping up everywhere, no matter where I look!  :D  On a different topic...ever get so happy that you cry? Happened to me yesterday; felt like everything hit at once and then this just overwhelming joy hit...Yeah. I don't know how to explain it...you just get it or you don't.  It's that joy of...you're  alive , you've got your arms around me, you're not going to disappear, and even though I'm all messed up, weird, crazy and neurotic, you just ovelook that and actually care about me.   Yeah.  It's the little things, it really is.   Something else was brought up, but I'm still pondering that. I thought about it yesterday and it made sense...I could go into it, but I'm sure that if I started talking about it, I'd wind up writing some sort of thesis on why this is and how the events of my life has given this particular psychological problem shape and form.  And then I wonder if I missed my calling...Then again, there are  way too many  psychiatrists and psychologists out there now anyway.

      Ah, the beauty of insomnia when exhaustion sets in. You  want  to sleep, but can't and things are never what they seem while in this state.   Lovely.  So there's a bunch of articles that were interesting to me [yay for WSJ's emails and IRC] -- they're kinda old, but whatever. I couldn't bring myself to post anything since Monday...sorry about that. Yeah. So without further ado, here you go:   urlLink A Life Revealed [damn I wish I had her eyes...]   urlLink Women and Firearms   urlLink Can you say, "Better late than never?"   urlLink Hell yeah I'd root for this team...   urlLink When Real Life emulates your current RPG/video game...   urlLink Ooooh Baby, Nerds are Sexy   Heh.  So today is the 16th. Six years ago to the day I celebrated my 16th birthday [a little early] with a Sweet 16 party that could have rivaled a wedding; normally in Paraguayan tradition I would have celebrated my Quinceañera, but being that America is the land where the Sweet 16 rules supreme, my mom tried to combine the two. She organized a Sweet 16 party in the tradition of a Quinceañera. Heh. Now THAT was interesting to say the least...it was held at  urlLink Giorgio's  complete with videographer, photographer, DJ, many-course meal, formal dress, etc. Like I said, the party rivaled a wedding in everyway. Hell, it probably surpassed a few weddings, but I digress. Funny how this shit hits home in the weirdest ways;  he  was there. Alive. Weird. Yeah. Now, nothing but memories and pictures. I wonder how many of those faces in the pictures whom I remember fondly are still around?? I've lost track of so many, what with switching high schools, graduation, college, life in general, etc. Interesting. Sad. These things hit home at the weirdest moments.  Four more days. I don't feel any different. I'm not gonna feel any different when it hits; I'm sure as hell not gonna feel any different a week from the day. Heh. I'm alive, I'm able to get another year older and celebrate the day of my birth; I guess it's all good. Hell yeah it's all good. I'm alive. My loved ones still surround me; my most favorite and loved person, my family, my friends whom I consider family, my dogs; they are all alive and well. Maybe I'm selfish; I don't know. Call me what you will. Call it as you see it, I don't really care. Fuck it, I'm alive and I'm gonna celebrate life.   I love you...

      I'm awake now, more coherent, better able to formulate words and type them out onto this screen.  But you know what? I can't think of anything to say.   I feel like everything I needed to say I was able to put up at 2AM; even though I'm probably the only one who would be able to understand the meaning behind the incoherent words. Tiredness and emotions seem to rob me of both my logic and my abillity to write.  I watched a little bit of TV before I had to just walk away and do something else; they were debating over whether or not compensation was really necessary for the families of victims, even as they showed the memorial light service in an inset on the screen. Maybe I'm the only one, but it seems so...hypocritical, maybe?...bear with me, my grasp of the English language and the ability to choose the right words seems to be slipping right at the moment...to smack down something that is seen as help even as they commemorate those who have died. Arguing over whether it was right to give some money back to the families of the victims, saying that all they were doing was collecting easy money and trying to put pricetags on their dead. Yes, I'm sure that there's a few people out there that are trying to take advantage of the situation but I believe that the majority of the families would tell these...   intellectuals   ...to shove that money straight up their collective asses and that they would rather have their wife/husband/sister/brother/mom/dad/daughter/son back and breathing and alive. That they would rather tell their young children that, yes, mommy or daddy  is  coming home today....or hold their spouses or children again.   I'm too weary to rant anymore of this. Many are dead. Shut the hell up because even in the face of a minority that are tryign to take advantage of people's kindness, the majority wish they could have their loved ones back, monetary compensations be damned.  I wish I could round up the rest of the fuckers behind this and let the families have at them; show them the mercy that they deserve.    My emotions are too raw, clouding my ability to write well. Nick, however, wrote his own  urlLink thoughts  on the matter...Very nice post -- wish I could have written my  original post  that well, but like I said...  Tiredness and raw emotions seem to rob me both of my logic and my ability to write.

      Well it's 2AM on Monday the 11th.  9 days left until my birthday... The start of a new week... The realization hits within a fit of insomnia...   Six months to the day of the tragedy.   So now what? Where do we go from here? Crazy things happen in the world everyday; nothing like that though. Damn memories. Came in late but I caught the tail end of that special thing they had on the TV...Hard to watch even now. Even though I caught the spot where they praised two men who carried a woman and her motorized wheelchair down 80-some-odd flights of stairs...OR something like that...I know I got it wrong, my brain is tired and shutting down.  The memories hurt.   Yeah, open up the photo albums and the memories hurt like hell, even though they're old memories, happy memories...but he's gone now.  Reminds me that my life is fragile and can be extinguished quickly. Hits home, seeing the pictures on TV...again...it hurts. Watching people try to pick through their lives, their homes that are still covered in debris from the day...Watch their rally to try to clean and regain their homes, their apartments. Life goes on, but they're still pickin up the pieces...Literally.  How do you go about regaining a life? You can't. It's over, it's that simple. Puts things into perspective; what the soldiers are dying for over there, overseas -- You can't regain the lives that were lost, but you sure as hell can avenge them and protect future lives from being lost. Protect their children, grandchildren, familes that have survived. Even help other lives on the other side of the world. But even so, he's dead, they're dead. They're not coming back.  Dead. Buried. God only knows where amongst that debris. The memories live on, and as painful as they are, fuck it. I'll smile through those goddamn tears, they can't steal my feelings. They stole lives; we won't fucking forget and we won't allow them to forget that simple fact either. There's hell to pay and we're coming to fucking collect. Fuck you, I'll see you in Hell.    And ED? I'm sorry. I have my pictures and I have my memories and I wish I could have said goodbye...Who knew this would happen? You were a good friend in life; just please do me one last favor and watch over my most favorite, loved person and laugh along with me when my life is funny, ok?

      Well last night was.... interesting ....to say the least. I learned a few things:  A.) My high alcohol tolerance is still pretty much intact. B.) Never play Dance Dance Revolution in steel-toed boots. C.) Never stop to contemplate an incredulous event when immediate retaliation is necessary.   So I wrote last night's blog while  slightly inebriated  [see: A] while Sylvia was killing the last Bacardi Silver and Seth was midway through his third Guinness. Jillian's was calling to kill our boredom, so we answered and drove there, parking the car on a sidestreet. After amusing ourselves with shoot-em-up games, racing games and my learning of a new lesson [see: B] Jillian's closed for the evening and we were kicked out. With nothing better to do [Boston shuts down at 2 AM] we walked back to the car, passing by a myriad of drunken idiots and the usual Lansdowne dumbasses and amused ourselves watching their actions. As we were not five feet away from the car, a group of four severely drunk men passed us by, laughing and stumbling about. Sylvia and Seth went to the driver's side of the car and I was coming up to the passenger side when one mumbled something to me; his speech was so slurred I have no idea what he said. I ignored him [as is my wont to do when drunkards/bums talk to me] but as he passed me by, my ass was smacked! I was incredulous; I stopped dead in my tracks for a moment to contemplate what had occurred. *Did that fucker do what I think he did? Yeah, my asscheek is stinging; that shithead smacked my ass!!! MOTHERFUCKER!!!  DIE!!!* As I turned around to retaliate with my fist, I realized that I had taken too much time pondering my incredulity as the fucker and his friends had already shambled halfway down the block. Bastards! I climbed into the passenger seat and told Sylvia and Seth what had happened; Sylvia pulled a U-turn and chased them down while I rolled down the window and pulled myself half-out of the car. We passed them by and I yelled at the guy, "Fuck you shithead! Watch your fuckin hands!" I learned quickly that the moment had passed [see: C] but I still felt a little better yelling at the guy.   Today was a better day; Sylvia and I went to have lunch with her parents. Trying to find the Swiss Hotel proved to be one hell of a task; that hotel is one of Boston's best kept secrets.   It turned out that we wandered around the damn building a few times and never knew it was there -- there was only ONE SIGN that clued us into its existance:  "Swiss Hotel: Employees Only" was posted on one of the sidedoors right next to a parking lot. Lovely. So we walked in through the parking lot and finally met up with her parents. Lunch in the hotel restaurant was a complete debacle; the service was horrendous and the food made us sick afterwards. But, the company was enjoyable. After lunch, Sylvia and I went to a store called H&M -- really nice clothes at really cheap prices. I bought $128 worth of clothes; unlike at other stores where $128 buys you  maybe  2 silk shirts, I got: 2 cottony/fuzzy t-shirts [one white w/wine-red highlights, one white w/navy-blue highlights], 1 long-sleeve shirt [white w/light blue sleeves], 1 black silk V-neck sweater, 1 navy silk collared short-sleeved shirt, 1 white silk collared short-sleeved shirt, 2 pairs of fishnets [red and olive] and a pair of black stockings with silver-star highlights. [NOTE: I   hate   shopping for clothes. I abhorr it with a passion; so for me to   actually walk into a clothing store of my own free will AND try on A TON of things   is quite an achievement on the part of the clothing store.] Yes, yes...it was fun...AND I got in my yearly clothes-shopping spree.  I also was able to get a chicken quesadilla at Burrito Max...damn that place doesn't change!!  Still the hang-out for punkers, hardcores, misfits, artists and "others"; the food is still awesome and prepared with actual care and pride by fellow punkers, hardcores, misfits, artists and "others".  :)    The only thing bad on the trip home was the ferry ride; the severely strong wind gusts made for rough waters and the boat was tossed about. Being the fact that my stomach hadn't really settled down from the bad lunch at the Swiss Hotel, it was NOT a pleasant ride. Yet, I slept through it as best as I could and tried not to think about it upon waking.  Well, time for me to attend to other things...Whee!

      Ah, Lansdowne Street...A one-block strip behind Fenway Park chock-full of trashy clubs [as well as normal bars, fun pubs and  urlLink Jillian's  at the end of the street but you'd never know it by the massive amounts of clubgoers]; the land of drunken-eurotrash fat sausage sluts and skinny stick bastards. Did I mention that they were multi-millionaire bastards who drive Mazaratis and Lamborghinis?? Heh. Gotta love that. Yes, the meeting ground for primped-up wanna-be fat chicks in skin-tight lamé shirts and spandex-riddled mini-skirts that stumble around in their huge platform shoes too drunk to realize that the sober rich guys aren't interested and the ones who seem interested are blinded by their beer-goggles.   Sausages and sticks; welcome to the land of the sexual shishkabob.   So of course we have to go down there tonight to amuse ourselves and laugh at the drunkards... :)  Yeap. You have to pass them by in order to get to Jillian's anyway so...Might as well amuse ourselves in the process!  Oh yeah... I'm in love with  urlLink Mr. Nice ...Must be that accent, baby!  ;)   [If anyone knows what show his song is from, please let me know...I recognize it but I can't think of where it's from; please help me!]  And...staying true to the cause...Here's another result to an internet test [thanks Nick...  ;) ]: __________________________________________________________________________________   Hey ho, you're Calibretto!  Kick. Arse.  Five metric tonnes of hulking, steam powered robo-meat, you are the pin-up boy for death robot technology. Although you are in fact a war golem, you know how to use a minigun, and you can benchpress small settlements. Relatively new to the colossal death robot scene, you were first pencilled by comic legend Joe Maduriera in 1998. Sensitive, stylish, and yet still massive, if you were female and not made of iron I would probably propose to you.  You can tell the world I love you with the following image of truth:     urlLink Which Colossal Death Robot Are  You ?

      I was driving home from Borders last night, almond chai in hand, when I stopped at a stoplight in front of a white van and behind a random dark-colored sedan. Didn't think much of this; I was lost in my thoughts, hoping to get home and start reading my two new books when the van behind me started  honking  at me. My first reaction was to release the brake and step on the gas pedal, when I realized [luckily in time!] that the light was still red and the sedan was still in front of me. I guess you could call me a typical NY driver; my head snapped up to the rearview and I cursed the motherfucker out, "WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?!  DO YOU  NOT SEE  THAT IT'S  STILL FUCKING RED  AND THERE'S A  FUCKING CAR IN FRONT  OF ME?!?!" Then I realized that someone in the passenger side of the van was flailing their arms -- my first reaction to this was, "Holy shit, someone's having an epileptic seizure! No wonder they want me to move..." -- But then I recognized that the person was trying to get my attention and quickly recognized both the driver and the passenger....My brother and his girlfriend!   Heh. I find people I know everywhere.  So of course I pulled over and talked to them...weird thing was that they had two other people in the van as well...One guy whom I used to know back in  elementary school  and a chick I used to know in my first high school!  Heh, they're "going out" now...Interesting how the world is so small. Thank God he wasn't one of the ones who made my life hell back then or else Bad Things would have Ensued. Yeah, my memory is pretty good at remembering when people fuck with me; I can carry a grudge for a  long time .   It was nice to see them all again...  «×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»¤«×»  I'm currently reading the CSS book I bought last night, scanning  urlLink Think Geek  and updating my  urlLink wishlist  with nifty stuff (hey! if you want to be nice to me since my birthday's coming up...search for "Raven Wolf") all while listening to my launchcast station and coming to the realization that one of my favorite "bands" that they play for me is called "Kruder and Dorfmeister". If those are their real names, I feel so bad for them; must've been hell growing up...

      I've come to the realization that I am addicted to taking random internet tests. Well I guess there's an upside to this...Maybe I'll begin to understand myself better. Hell, I just found out that there's a nice and neat little label to describe my [what for years I considered to be weird and dysfunctional] personality...and they even made it sound wonderful!!!

      Understand me. Here you go...  According to the  urlLink Keirsey Temperament Sorter  I am an Idealist/Champion.   All Idealists (NFs) share the following core characteristics:  ¤¤¤ Idealists are enthusiastic, they trust their intuition, yearn for romance, seek their true self, prize meaningful relationships, and dream of attaining wisdom.    ¤¤¤ Idealists  pride themselves on being loving, kindhearted, and authentic.    ¤¤¤ Idealists tend to be giving, trusting, spiritual, and they are focused on personal journeys and human potentials.    ¤¤¤ Idealists make intense mates, nurturing parents, and inspirational leaders.   Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible self--always this quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling, in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry, they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials.  Idealists are sure that friendly cooperation is the best way for people to achieve their goals. Conflict and confrontation upset them because they seem to put up angry barriers betrween people. Idealists dream of creating harmonious, even caring personal relations, and they have a unique talent for helping people get along with each other and work together for the good of all. Such interpersonal harmony might be a romantic ideal, but then Idealists are incurable romantics who prefer to focus on what might be, rather than what is. The real, practical world is only a starting place for Idealists; they believe that life is filled with possibilities waiting to be realized, rich with meanings calling out to be understood. This idea of a mystical or spiritual dimension to life, the "not visible" or the "not yet" that can only be known through intuition or by a leap of faith, is far more important to Idealists than the world of material things.  Highly ethical in their actions, Idealists hold themselves to a strict standard of personal integrity. They must be true to themselves and to others, and they can be quite hard on themselves when they are dishonest, or when they are false or insincere. More often, however, Idealists are the very soul of kindness. Particularly in their personal relationships, Idealists are without question filled with love and good will. They believe in giving of themselves to help others; they cherish a few warm, sensitive friendships; they strive for a special rapport with their children; and in marriage they wish to find a "soulmate," someone with whom they can bond emotionally and spiritually, sharing their deepest feelings and their complex inner worlds.   Idealists are rare, making up no more than 8 to 10 percent of the population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their numbers.   _________________________________________________________________________________________  Idealist Portrait of the Champion (ENFP)   Like the other Idealists, Champions are rather rare, say two or three percent of the population, but even more than the others they consider intense emotional experiences as being vital to a full life. Champions have a wide range and variety of emotions, and a great passion for novelty. They see life as an exciting drama, pregnant with possibilities for both good and evil, and they want to experience all the meaningful events and fascinating people in the world. The most outgoing of the Idealists, Champions often can't wait to tell others of their extraordinary experiences. Champions can be tireless in talking with others, like fountains that bubble and splash, spilling over their own words to get it all out. And usually this is not simple storytelling; Champions often speak (or write) in the hope of revealing some truth about human experience, or of motivating others with their powerful convictions. Their strong drive to speak out on issues and events, along with their boundless enthusiasm and natural talent with language, makes them the most vivacious and inspiring of all the types.   Fiercely individualistic, Champions strive toward a kind of personal authenticity, and this intention always to be themselves is usually quite attractive to others. At the same time, Champions have outstanding intuitive powers and can tell what is going on inside of others, reading hidden emotions and giving special significance to words or actions. In fact, Champions are constantly scanning the social environment, and no intriguing character or silent motive is likely to escape their attention. Far more than the other Idealists, Champions are keen and probing observers of the people around them, and are capable of intense concentration on another individual. Their attention is rarely passive or casual. On the contrary, Champions tend to be extra sensitive and alert, always ready for emergencies, always on the lookout for what's possible.   Champions are good with people and usually have a wide range of personal relationships. They are warm and full of energy with their friends. They are likeable and at ease with colleagues, and handle their employees or students with great skill. They are good in public and on the telephone, and are so spontaneous and dramatic that others love to be in their company. Champions are positive, exuberant people, and often their confidence in the goodness of life and of human nature makes good things happen.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________  So there you go...An interesting insight as to why I have an emotional overload. >:)

      Whee. Laundry is almost as theraputic as writing. Of course, I am a dumbass. Instead of saying something, I typed it out and posted it for everyone to see. For me, it's easier to type things out and write things down than it is to actually say things. Yes, I am a dumbass. I should have said something...but I didn't. And for that, for what it's worth...  I'm sorry.

      Yeah.   I'm human and yesterday...my Ego and my Pride both got kicked in the head. This infuriated my Jealous side, which, in a fit of rage, bitch-slapped my Depressive Nature out of its hibernation, who in turn, woke up and immediately went into overdrive. Yeap, that about sums it up. Heh.   Yeah I must've been  great  to be around yesterday.   Ok, I'll admit it; as much as I want to disregard this, I'm only human. How would  you  feel if the coolest thing imaginable to you right at the moment happened and you missed out and the next day your best friend tells you how cool it was? That they went, had a shitload of fun...and then you get to read everyone else's opinions on the event [which pretty much boils down to "This was awesome! This kicked ass! Let's do it again!"] ...while you were left out? Yeah. I thought so. I think the thing that hit me the hardest was that...knowing how cool this is blogging thing is to me, no one let me know. Hell, I would have called and said, "Hey, check this shit out! Maybe you might not think it's cool but...check it out anyway, here's what's happening." Yeah, that hurts. But whatever, I'll get over it. I know I'm probably making a big deal out of nothing but...yeah, it hurts. So I'll just kinda sit back today, do my laundry, let these  stupid feelings  run their course and make myself get over it.   Yeah.  Anyway, my mom returned home today. This is fun. So far, nothing big has happened; I think the jet lag is still screwing with her system. Maybe I'll get lucky and she won't mess with me for a while...I need some time to myself. And yeah, I'll keep up with this blog thing...Thanks  Evo , thanks  Chris !! So I guess people actually do read this thing!      :)    Yeah. :)

      So I'm feeling better from this afternoon and yet I feel like I missed the train...again.  Yesterday was this whole big blogger get-together thing and I missed out on it. All the people whose blogs I like were there...and I was... elsewhere , bored out of my skull. Bleh. I heard that it was really cool, fun and interesting...Yeah. That's cool I guess...Wish I went. Hell, I wish I even  knew about it . I'm human. I'm jealous that all these people got together and I wasn't there. Typical. Every time I try to get involved with something new, I miss the big thing that happens within it. I feel like I got gypped because I missed a few days of checking other blogs. While it's cool that it was fun for everyone who went, I still feel shitty, because...hey, I missed out, ya know? It's like...playing lotto. You play the same numbers every day, and then, the one day you forget to buy the ticket -- that's preceisely the day someone calls you up and tells you, "Hey guess what? You won the lotto! They called your numbers!"  It sucks. Or like...missing the express train. You know there's gonna be another train coming, but damn...it's a local and all you really wanted to do was catch that express and snooze your way into the city. Damn. I don't know why this is bothering me so much, but it is...I mean, it's not the end of the world. It  shouldn't  be that big of a deal...I guess I just have issues... It's that whole emotional overload thing. Bleh. Just bleh. I always "miss the train". It's just not fair.  So I'm giving up on my blogger. Why?   A -- It serves no purpose. Well, in the sense that all the other bloggers are  important , speaking out against this and that...and whatever. Mine's just here, taking up digital space, a place for my own retarded ramblings and rants on life in general. I have no important issues to speak out against. I put some time and effort into it...but it serves no purpose. Which makes me wonder...if even after everything my creation serves no purpose...do I serve a purpose?  B -- I'm the only one who cares about it, being that...oh fuck it...I just explained everything in the last reason. Which leads me to...  C -- It should have never been made to begin with. I see this now. I should have just stuck with "analog" -- good old pencil and a spiralbound notebook. My messy handwriting in a notebook that can be thrown away or tossed on a shelf and forgotten. Heh. What was I thinking? Did I honestly think that people would actually read it? Yeah, I guess. I thought that maybe someone out there would stumble across my little piece of digitalia, read it over and say, "Hey, you know? Maybe I'm not as messed up as I think I am. This chick is just as weird as me. I don't feel so bad anymore." Or something to that effect. But no one's out there, so why bother. Lots of highly intellectual people out there are criticizing the world...me? I just live here. It's too fucked up for me to save, so...  Yeah.  I'm still gonna post to this thing, though. I tend to feel better just pretending that someone out there is reading my randomness. That I have a place in the world. That I have a purpose and the things I create have a purpose...even though the opposite is true.  Have a nice life.

      I've always been fascinated with death...Today I just wish I could lay myself down and go. Dream myself into another existance. I want to drive hell-bent-for-leather away from this fucking place and never come back. I want to walk away from my fucking life and create a new one without all these expectations. I'm tired of being me. I want to be someone else. I want to live a different life.   I want to not exist anymore.   In the grand scheme of the universe, in the grand scheme of life, where do I fit in? I'm nothing but a blip on a great map, my life isn't worth much. I'm not important. If I died tomorrow, who would know? What would happen? Not much.   I'm tired...so very tired of it all.   Life fucking sucks. I want to leave this dusty world behind and never return.  Someone please shoot me now, I'm tired of the game of life.

With that said, I normally think of cows in terms of....well....Filet Mignon, Prime Rib, Medium Rare, Easy on the A-1...etc. And of course, without cows, coffee just wouldn't be the same for me.   However,  urlLink this is just disturbing ....  Thanks to a fellow  urlLink BlogSnob (who happens to love cows)  for posting that...    I'll betcha you'll never think of cows in the same way ever again.   >:)

        Nothing beats VAMPIRIC CARNAGE!!!    So I hopped in my car, drove over to Nick's house, picked him up and dragged him along with me to  finally  see Blade II earlier this evening; have to say it was  pure cheeeze and $fX , but damn those fight and death scenes ROCKED!  HELL YEAH! Have to give credit to Mr. Wesley Snipes; he makes vampires look damn cool to someone who loves werewolves....And I want his weaponry! AWESOME.  I have three things I really want to link to; the first is  urlLink an excellent post by Mike  [you know, the one who understands and appreciates us Tough Chicks] comparing young people of today and young people of past times. The angst is still there [obviously] but before, things were dealt with in a better way; you never saw such a high amount of kids picking up guns and going on rampages against their schoolmates. Go read it now. You should.   The second is this  urlLink awesome picture of the world at night  [via  urlLink Instapundit ] -- Nighttime is my favorite time; the time I feel most alive and in tune with myself...  The third is a site that  urlLink generates your very own Evil Plan  [ urlLink thanks to Pej  for a cool link! :) ]   Congratulations on being the creator of a new Evil Plan (tm)!   Your objective is simple:  Soul Accumulation . Your motive is a little bit more complex: Evil - It's my nature   Stage One  To begin your plan, you must first seduce a chosen one. This will cause the world to sit up and take notice, stunned by your arrival. Who is this unholy menace? Where did they come from? And why do they look so good in classic black?    Stage Two  Next, you will seize control of New York. This will cause countless hordes of supernatural creatures to flock to you, begging to do your every bidding. Your name will become synonymous with rage, as lesser men whisper your name in terror.    Stage Three  Finally, you will unleash your horsemen of the apocalypse, bringing about the end of all things. This will all be done from a Obsidian Citadel, an excellent choice if we might say.   These three deeds will herald the end, and the citizens of this planet will have no choice but to elect you their new god.  Trust us, it'll all come together in the end...  *giggles evilly and steeples her fingers*    Excellent.     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    One last thing before I go.... urlLink Uthant   FINALLY  got updated! WOO HOO!  OK go check that out now. :)

        Looks like  urlLink HeroMachine  is getting popular now with a NON-RPG crowd...    For those of us who play RPGs, HeroMachine is nothing new; it's been a great tool to make a visual representation for the character you have created. Now I wonder, how did the rest of you non-gamers find out about it? LOL!   How much you wanna bet it'll be the "new craze" of the blogosphere since  urlLink one of the cool kids  has "discovered" it?     ;D    Now all we need to do is get you guys into gaming....     Curious as to what the Ravenwolf looks like as an RPG character? Go  urlLink here .     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤      Verbosity, BlogSnob, BlogMania...    They sound interesting, don't they?   >:)         urlLink      urlLink

This is beginning to get ridiculous; my blog apparently has decided that it likes to update itself with a one-post lag...In other words, if I post something new, it will update my site with the post I wrote directly before the current post...Anyone know what's going on with Blogger?  Anyone?  Anyone???     ...Bueller?

        Congrats to Meg---errr...Jane Galt...    She made WSJ's Best of the Web email today for her  urlLink reflective post on what happened at the WTC ....  :)  [sorry if I'm late on this, but I just got the new email about 5 minutes ago...]  Who Is Jane Galt? She's a recovery worker at the World Trade Center site, and she's got a blog, on which she's posted some of her reflections on her months at ground zero.   Excellent. I'm still waiting for the address/website of the place where you can submit posts for the Blogger book...Can anyone help me? I'd like to submit her post as well...   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Here's another job I would love to do:  urlLink Military Interrogation . The only problem I have with it is the fact that I'd have to do all that military training in order to get into it...Which rots...Since I  know  that I wouldn't last 2 minutes in boot camp. Heh. But on the upside, at least I know this! Anyway...   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   What a nice way to hammer the nails into your own coffin:  urlLink Saudi Telethon Host Calls for Enslaving Jewish Women . What...the...fuck!? I was hoping to see "The Onion" somewhere in that link, but I realized a few things:  A.) I don't think that even the Onion would stoop that low B.) It's so fucked up, it has to be real.  I don't know what else to say. My mind is boggled with the stupidity and arrogance that these people continually show.  Never a dull moment, huh...

        Hrrrrrrm.... urlLink Friday Five ?    Well, this sounded interesting so I thought I'd join in.   1. What are your hobbies?  Oh boy...waaaaay too many to list here; top favorites include: photography, poetry, dancing, observing people, talking to strangers, RPGs, CAV and now, starting to get into BattleTech [whenever my friends have time to play!!!],  writing down thoughts, bitching/moaning/whining [sorry The Paul!!  >:) ], reading, listening to music, playing my violin and piano...   2. Do you collect anything? If so, what?  Silver jewelry, perferably rings and necklaces. Gargoyles, dragons, wolves, ravens, dolphins, sharks, hawks, jaguars of all kinds; i.e. figurines, statues, pictures, jewelry, whatever. Candles; scented ones, colorful ones, handmade ones...Stones from the beach that I like and feel the need to take home with me. Anything of a Celtic or Native American origin. Books on psychology, metaphysical studies, occult, esoterics, mysticism, spirituality and the afterlife.    3. Is there a hobby you're interested in, but just don't have the time/money to do?  I am currently involved in photography, but unfortunately I miss my time in a professional darkroom...  :(   4. Have you ever turned a hobby into a moneymaking opportunity?  Well, yes and no. Yes because at one time I was hired to play my violin at weddings and other such events. I'm currently hoping to [in the near future] turn my photography and computer obsession into a money-making opportunity. We'll see how that goes...   5. Besides web-related stuff (burbs, rings, etc.), what clubs do you belong to?   Well, I'm semi-involved with the Rotary Club -- that's pretty much the more well-known of the clubs I belong to. I'm also a member of the International Center of Photography, the vice president of my school's Gaming Club, a part of the school's online newspaper and that's pretty much it....  So there's my take on "the Friday Five"....

        Again, what did you expect!?    Ok I  knew  they were busy shoving their crap down their children's throats, but I never knew how far it actually went...Apparently,  urlLink hatred is taught in school along with arithmetic and spelling :  "I tell them that they are Palestinians, that they must defend their land when they grow up, that this land belongs to them and not to the Jews, our enemies," said the 35-year-old Hassain. "Every morning, I ask them: 'Did you watch the news? Do you love the enemy who massacres the Palestinian people? Would you want to make peace with them when you grow up?' "    Keep in mind that this is for a KINDERGARTEN CLASS; they start their brainwashing early. Again, what would you expect from people who show their children that their lives are worthless? Thanks to  urlLink Pej  for the article..

        I love WSJ's emails...but I hate being the last to discuss them...Oh well...    I'll continue on anyway! LOL  So I get my Best of the Web email, read over the articles contained therein, formulate an opinion and then read my daily blogs. Sucks to see everyone else already commented on the things you thought were interesting...and they say everything better than you. Heh! Well, I don't care, I'm gonna talk about this stuff anyway because I like it. :P  Mr. Arnot was doing what he's paid to do; investigating things, reporting on them, doing what journalists normally do...No big deal. He videotaped what he saw fit, interviewed people, jotted down notes on his laptop and went about his business. Business as usual, yes? Surely, but he was in Saudi Arabia at the time; on a lay-over while heading home, officials asked him to step off the plane and speak with security. After that, all went to hell in a handbasket as they searched his belongings, looked over his tapes, confiscated everything and sent him on his way. Lovely. And this is  urlLink coming from another country who supposedly has freedom of the press ? Interesting...   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Oh, I love the irony of it all...A group of Palestinians are "shocked and dismayed" at the fact that other, harder-hitting  urlLink political groups are using children as cheap weaponry to infiltrate settlements . This is in the wake of  urlLink 3 boys arming themselves with homemade pipe bombs and knives who were shot dead by Israelian soldiers before they could do anything . I say, WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU EXPECT?!  Because for the most part and on the whole, these are the people who have taught their children that their lives are worthless and in order to make something of themselves and make their parents proud, they should blow themselves up to kill the enemy. This is apparent in the suicide note left by one of the boys:   "Oh mother, please be happy with me. I ask you to pray to God to make my martyrdom operation a success," wrote Zaqout. "I am giving my soul for the sake of God and the homeland."   And yet, his mother goes on to shift the blame elsewhere:  Zaqout's mother could hardly choke back her tears. "What can I say? They killed my boy," she sobbed.   Asked if she understood his motives, she said: "Children are tormented by what they see on television. Israel has left all Palestinians, including children, with no choice but to die."   WHAT?! You have got to be shitting me!! They are tormented because you have filled their heads with meaningless hate and stole their childhoods away from them! They are tormented because they may not fully comprehend what is going on and you stuff your ideology down their throats instead of explaining what is happening in the world around them! They are tormented because you are teaching them that their lives are fucking worthless and that they will never amount to anything! THAT IS WHY THEY ARE TORMENTED. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR LIVES. Just like everywhere else, you don't like what your kids see on TV? Turn that shit off and  talk  to them; spend some damn time with your kids!  THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IF YOU JUST GAVE THEM THE TIME OF DAY AND TOLD THEM THAT YOU LOVED THEM, THAT THEY WERE WORTH SOMETHING  ALIVE  AND ALLOWED THEM TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND THEM.    "It is despair, despair and more despair. Children are unable to cope with the sad reality," he told Reuters, adding that child suicide attackers were motivated more by an overwhelming sense of hopelessness than surging nationalism.   You are so "shocked" and "outraged" and "dismayed" that your children would do such a thing; that's saying something. LOOK AT WHAT YOU ARE TEACHING THEM.                                         All photos courtesy of Yahoo! News: click on them to see the original picture with the caption and corresponding article.   Look at what you are shoving into their young, impressionable minds from the time they are able to walk! They can't cope because they can't escape it. They can't cope because what they see is that each and every suicide bomber is revered upon their death, moreso than they ever were in life! They have no self worth, they have no pride. Why? Think about it, you dumbfucks, think about what you are doing to your own children. You will not survive very long if even your children want to die before they are fully even alive.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   On a happier note, there is a possibility that  urlLink there might not be an oil shortage after all ...  What the scientists suspect is that very old petroleum -- formed tens of millions of years ago -- has continued migrating up into reservoirs that oil companies have been exploiting for years. But no one had expected that depleted oil fields might refill themselves.  Now, if it is found that gas and oil are coming up in significant amounts, and if the same is occurring in oil fields around the globe, then a lot more fuel than anyone expected could become available eventually. It hints that the world may not, in fact, be running out of petroleum.   This is great news! Of course, I think that research should be continued with other forms of energy as well as the tried and true methods should be implemented more often [solar panels, electricity, etc] but still...great news!  OK enough on the emails...gonna look around the internet and see what else is out there...

        And suddenly, the obvious that was obscure [to me] becomes obvious...    Nice article [ urlLink What Causes People to Become Terrorists?  via  urlLink Nick ] that kinda ties into the concept that I mentioned yesterday -- Yet, this article made me realize something fundamentally important to me and put it into focus; something  completely different  than the issue that is currently being discussed. It lies within this quote:    That is occupied, conquered territory, fairly won by Israel as they defended themselves against a simultaneous attack by Egypt, Syria, and Jordan -- the nations which, prior to 1967 war, ruled the territories that are now called "Palestinian."     I am lucky enough to have been accepted into a good family; my parents have worked damn hard and overcome enormous odds for everything they have accomplished and acquired in their lives. Because of their sacrifice, hard work and determination, I am again, lucky enough to be able to enjoy the benefits that they have gained. I have traveled quite a lot in my short life with them and in 1993 I visited Israel. Being a Paraguayan citizen and holding a Paraguayan passport, I [and the rest of my family] normally get a hassle in international airports while the rest of the group that we travel with [whom all hold American passports] could virtually walk into the country with only slight problems/questions or none at all. While visiting Israel, however, the roles were reversed; for once, our Paraguayan passports allowed  us  to almost saunter in and be treated like royalty while the rest of the American passport holding group had to go through the trials and tribulations that we  normally  go though. I remember reveling in this and asking my mother why; she explained to me that  urlLink  in 1947, the UN held some discussions as to whether Israel should be recognized as a country . Paraguay had added its voice to the discussion and apparently was the deciding vote in favor to recognize Israel as a country. Of course, she said that this was the reason why we were treated so well. At the time, I was 13 years old and I wasn't about to argue with my mother; I was just happy and deeply satisfied that the rest of the group had to undergo our normal problems. A small part of me felt vindicated and my curiosity was satisfied for the moment.     Only  now do I know  for certain that Paraguay was one of 33 countries who voted in favor [against 13 who voted against and 10 who abstained from voting]; only now do I begin to realize that maybe what my mother said was true. Heh. But what really struck me was this part of the quote from the article that I posted above:      "fairly won by Israel as they defended themselves against a simultaneous attack by Egypt, Syria, and Jordan"     Sounds familiar; in 1867 Paraguay was caught in the same situation; the Treaty of the Triple Alliance [which included Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay] threatened Paraguayan borders, but the one major difference is that Paraguay was already recognized as its own nation and country.     Solano López accurately assessed the September 1864 Brazilian intervention in Uruguay as a slight to the region's lesser powers. He was also correct in his assumption that neither Brazil nor Argentina paid much attention to Paraguay's interests when they formulated their policies. But he concluded incorrectly that preserving Uruguayan "independence" was crucial to Paraguay's future as a nation. Consistent with his plans to start a Paraguayan "third force" between Argentina and Brazil, Solano López committed the nation to Uruguay's aid. When Argentina failed to react to Brazil's invasion of Uruguay, Solano López seized a Brazilian warship in November 1864. He quickly followed this move with an invasion of Mato Grosso, Brazil, in March 1865, an action that proved to be one of Paraguay's few successes during the war. Solano López then decided to strike at his enemy's main force in Uruguay. But Solano López was unaware that Argentina had acquiesced to Brazil's Uruguay policy and would not support Paraguay against Brazil. When Solano López requested permission for his army to cross Argentine territory to attack the Brazilian province of Río Grande do Sul, Argentina refused. Undeterred, Solano López sent his forces into Argentina, probably expecting local strongmen to rebel and remove Argentina from the picture. Instead, the action set the stage for the May 1865 signing by Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay (now reduced to puppet status) of the Treaty of the Triple Alliance. Under the treaty, these nations vowed to destroy Solano López's government.      [Quote taken from  urlLink this website : scroll down to the "Dictatorship and War" section and then click on the link for "The War of the Triple Alliance". I would have linked directly to the page but there is a warning on the page itself:  "Do NOT bookmark these search results. Search results are stored in a TEMPORARY file for display purposes. The temporary file will be purged from our system in a few hours." ]     I begin to realize both Paraguay and Israel's intrinsic relationship with one another; something that I thought was weird and interesting as a kid is beginning to make some sort of sense now.     But I'll ponder this more on the train-ride home as it is time to leave this damn computer lab.

        Le Sigh...    Again, I lose a nice long post to Blogger oblivion. The second attempt was saved, but....it's just not the same. To add aggravation to annoyance, now it's telling me: "Error: Object required (server:disco). Please try again." so my updates aren't getting posted. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRGH! This really friggin rots. Too bad I can't talk to them like I talked to the Sprint sales representative...Oh well. Whatever.  And I have to say...It was fun while it lasted; my own  fifteen minutes of fame are up. *giggles* I knew the pitfall was coming, so it's all good. On a nice note, I now have titles to my posts; a new and interesting extra little feature added to my blog. Heh, it's the little things.   urlLink One more funny thing  before I go...Thanks to  urlLink Pej  for the amusement!  Time for sleepy.

        Well,  that  was easy...     urlLink According to Jon , I somehow stumbled into the well-populated and infamous land of political blogging with my response to the UN school article. ACK! Someone should put up warning signs for this stuff...lol!  Well today wasn't the best of days but I cheered myself up by buying myself flowers; roses in all different odd colors. Four white with purple-red trim, three blood red, three pale ice pink, and two almost translucent ecru roses made up my dozen. They are currently happily living in a vase right next to my monitor...  :D  I also finally did something about my damn cellphone; the frustration of taking it back to the store almost every week for it to get worked on and "fixed" was just getting tiring. I walked in there and said, "Bitches! Gimme a phone that fucking works!"  ...Well, not exactly in those words, per sé; I [of course] used a more professional tone and worked some diplomatic magic to convey my message but the salesguy got the underlying message. Heh. Needless to say I have a brand new  working  phone now.  >:)   Switching gears for a moment, there are a few things I need to link here. First is Megan's post about the  urlLink WTC in its current state  [scroll down a bit to find it, for some reason the permalink isn't working on her site]; I couldn't agree with her more. I don't work there but I lost someone dear to me in that site and I still haven't come to grips with it. I don't think I could handle working there; much respect to her for doing [what is to me] the impossible.   Second is an article [via my daily WSJ "Best of the Web" email] about a urlLink  5 year old child being used as a drug mule ; my initial reaction was a double-take and a very loud, "WHAT THE FUCK?!" I remember reading about the  urlLink 12 year old boy from Nigeria  who was used for the same purposes; this frightens and disgusts me. A 12 year old boy is horrible enough, but a 5 year old girl!? I agree with the official, Joe Webber:    "Sending a five-year-old girl alone on a plane to smuggle heroin represents a new low  even for drug traffickers," said Joe Webber, the U.S. Customs Service Special Agent-in-Charge for New York. ``This case demonstrates the depths to which trafficking organizations have sunk to ply their deadly trade."    What kind of people send their children to do this kind of shit? In the first case, the boy's father was already in jail for his involvement in the drug trade; you would think the boy would know better than to swallow   87 condoms worth of heroin . You would think the rest of the family would denounce the boy's father and try to save the boy from the same fate. At least at 12, the boy would have some sort of opinion on the matter and has enough brainpower to figure things out for himself...What the hell are they doing sending a 5 year old girl,  alone  on a plane to  a completely different country  with luggage filled with heroin?!  I just don't understand these types of people. I know that I never will, either. Disgusting.  Third is a concept that I came across first at  urlLink  [which points to  urlLink an article ], mentioned briefly in  urlLink Megan's site  [again, you have to scroll down -- she points to a post by  urlLink Sgt. Stryker ], and I started mulling over this. Interesting; I find that I like Stryker's post more, but both are good. I'm going to hold off commenting about this until tomorrow when I'm more awake and coherent.  And since I hate leaving on such a somber and serious note, fourth is Doc Weevil's amusing look at the  urlLink relationship between blogger and journalist .  Now it's sleepy-time; I've got a midterm tomorrow. But before I go, let me feed my addiction:      urlLink What kind of drunk are  you ?

        So, anyone else having problems with Blogger...?    I keep friggin posting and updating but to no avail; this is getting mighty fucking annoying. GRRRRR!   Well anyway, I read  urlLink this article  [via  urlLink Sasha , but by email]. I honestly am at a loss for words on this one:    UNIS Director Kenneth Wrye defended the school's no-flag policy. "We're not an American school. We are a United Nations school. It's that simple," Wrye said.     You know what though, Mr Wrye? When your school's  student body , [you know, the one that is made up of the  international students  that you are so vainly trying to "protect" from the world] recognizes the disrespect being shown and understands the issue better than you know [or give them credit for], it's time to bite the bullet and do what's right. Fly the flag.  Dumbass.     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Changing lanes here,  I completely forgot that this weekend was  urlLink I-CON ; damn, I missed meeting  urlLink Voltaire   yet  again  !!!!! ARRGH!  Oh well...next year, hopefully. *keeps fingers crossed* He's one of my favorite musicians; right up there with  urlLink Trent ,  urlLink Maynard , and a few others...*sigh* Oh well.   ...Not like I was gonna miss the BlogParty...HEH!   There's always next year, Voltaire...   Anyway, enough frustration for one night [bastard Blogger!! You killed my nice long posts! GRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrr......] -- It's time for sleep. I honestly have no desire to try to face another day of school  without  sleep...Nitey nite!

        The honorary NYer sent me some email...    So, I take a break from reading over all my usual blogs to check my email and I find a few emails from my newfound friends from the blogparty! :D  *dances around* One of them was from  urlLink the good Doc  who sent me a picture:    urlLink       I cropped it a bit so that it would be a more manageable size to display... To quote my good friend   The Paul   when he saw it:    "Dawwwwww!"  Yeah, I like this picture. Don't you?  :D       ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    On a completely different note: What the hell is up with Blogger? I've been trying to update for  a while  now and it keeps giving me shit and losing my posts! GRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrr........Must....Restrain...Fist...Of....Death...

My dearest Nick, I expect that your blog will be hit up  a ton  now [right up there along with the other heavy-hitters in the blogosphere]. Soooo... SHUSH!   ;D    Congrats... *giggles*   And for all you chicks out there who are gonna flock to his site and check him out now that he's all famous and stuff...Yeah, I  know  he's hot! And he's  mine  too, so... back off , biotches. Got a problem with that? My steel-toed boots and your cranium will be throroughly introduced...and if that's not incentive enough, I've got a baseball bat with your name on it...Wanna see?  >:)     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   *ponders sleep...too much rambling, not enough coherence*  Ack!!

      Ok...So I lied. I'm not done rambling yet.  >:)  Like I said before, none of my digital pictures from the party came out too well, but I figured I'd post what I had...These are the ones that you can actually  see  and figure out that yes, there  are  people in these pictures! Heh.    urlLink        urlLink        urlLink       Oh yeah, I have a picture of Asparagirl  urlLink as well , but...I'll only post that on demand.  >:)   On a completely different track, I thought I'd share the fact that during one of my bouts with insomnia, I found a site with which you can  urlLink create little banners  to promote your blog or write  urlLink witty little sayings  with them. Of course, I created a few [this being one of them:       ...and then I realized that I could make much more colorful ones using Photoshop. Since I got bored of seeing the text link for the Yaccs comments, I decided to create a banner for it; I'm thinking of doing the same with the Blogger banner. Like 'em? Want one for your site? Let me know...I need something to pass the time away...   ;D   One more thing before I attempt to do something productive [like  sleep ] -- Heh, damn that internet-test-taking-addiction:   urlLink        urlLink which "monty python and the holy grail" character are you?   this quiz was made by  urlLink colleen      urlLink        urlLink which children's storybook character are you?   this quiz was made by  urlLink colleen      urlLink        urlLink which 80s hair band are you?   this quiz was made by  urlLink colleen

      Yesterday was interesting...Nick and I drove around the island trying to find this damn book but every place we went to was either closed or didn't have it in stock. I guess that's what we get for trying to locate things on a Sunday...Heh! Anyway, as we were driving around from one store to another, we watched this white Nissan Maxima drive like a lunatic down Rte. 25: weaving in and out of lanes, dodging cars and trucks to beat them to the stoplight, ignoring the red light and coasting through it a minute before it turned green, things of that nature. It got to the point where there was a clear road in front of a random sedan in the right lane and a red truck in the left. This guy rode the sedan's bumper, squeezed past the red truck, sped up for about 2 minutes before throwing his car into the dedicated middle left-turn lane where he paused for all of 15 seconds and then decided to try his luck cutting off oncoming traffic to get to where he needed to go...  The man pulled into the  Starbucks   parking lot.  I laughed so hard I almost caused an accident. How  sad  is that!? You would think that if someone is driving  that insanely  they would have somewhere  important  to be...You know, the hospital...their burning house...but   STARBUCKS  ?!  I guess the lure of the Frappuccino was just too hard to bear. Heh.   Other than that, it was a pretty good day overall, considering that I got my allergy injections [OWWWW! Painful, but I rather  like  breathing!]. I talked to Sasha earlier and had a nice conversation...  :D    But, tomorrow is class and I need a good night's sleep; rest assured though, I'll probably update sometime during C++....   >;)

I'd rather see him in a cold fury than see him slightly sad. Either way, that's not exactly the bridge I want to burn, you know?   Well anyway, it's time for sleepy.

      So today is my father's birthday. I feel horrible; with everything else that happened so far, I completely forgot about it. I'm not sure what to do; it's too late to run out and buy something...I'm hoping that he won't be  too  mad. :/  I don't know where to begin with this; it looks like he's had a long, horrendous day and I really don't want to add to his aggravation. I tried slinking away earlier, but that didn't work; he was everywhere, trying to keep busy, re-cleaning the house and rearranging everything I have done, trying to burn off excess nervous energy. [I recognize those symptoms, since I do the same damn thing, heh.]  It's time to go eat dinner...I hope I don't hurt him even more than I already have....

      Wow.  Just...Wow. The blogparty rocked! Told that stupid voice in the back of my head to  shutthefuckup  [even though it proved correct to a  slight degree ] and thoroughly enjoyed myself; a lot of people defied my expectations and almost everyone was friendly, nice and welcoming.  urlLink Orchid  and Asparagirl [no link neccessary, she's just that well-known, heh :) !] did a great job picking the place; it was a hard to find hole-in-the-wall bar with an all-black unmarked door -- but once you walked in, the atmosphere was cozy.  urlLink Ken  twisted my mind; I've been reading his blog for awhile; for some reason I  was expecting someone  completely different  but was happily surprised with this funny, easyoing, insanely interesting guy...Remind me to go to  any party  he goes to! His own recap of the party is amusing [as he shows off his  urlLink knowledge of adjectives ] -- Same with  urlLink Sasha  and  urlLink Orchid : I'll follow those two to any party! Sasha was the only one brave enough to dance with me [although admittedly she is a  much  better dancer than I] and Orchid is just that insanely great!  :D  As for everyone else....here goes nothing....I have no idea why, but I thought  urlLink Lane  was an older guy (even though he posted his picture) and  urlLink Jonathan 's blog is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  >:)   urlLink Clay  amused the hell out of me for most of the night; I hope his pictures come out [and if they do, send me copies!] I was somewhat awed that the  urlLink mind behind overlawyered  had attended the party; didn't really get to talk to Mr. Olson, but from what others have said, he's a pretty good guy. Didn't really get a chance to talk to  urlLink Doc Weevil ,  urlLink Megan ,  urlLink Raghu  or the guy from  urlLink LawMeme  [I'm sorry!!! I'm horrible with names!!! I forgot yours!!! AAAHH!!!!   .....but your T-shirt worked wonders!] but yes, they were there as well.  urlLink PIGS & FISHES!!!  'Nuff said.  ;)  Have to say hi to Paul: 1.) Where did you get the subway t-shirt?! and 2.) Sorry I lost the name sticker so I can't really do much else...   :(   Hopefully you'll see this and will be able to contact me in the future.  Anyone else I forgot?   I'm sorry!!!!   My mind still needs to recuperate...Just send me [hate(?)] mail or leave a comment !!! I'll make sure to include you in any updates.... :D  One more thing: I   know   a damn lot of you brought cameras [and iirc, someone mentioned a videocamera?] -- please send me copies of the pix! My own digital camera's flash decided that it needed to overcompensate for the darkness and all my pictures came out as if they were overdeveloped...Thanks!

      Grrrrrrrrrrrrr......  The YACCS comments aren't working.

      Tomorrow is the blogbash; 25 people are supposed to show up. I'm somewhat worried since a few of the people whose blogs I'm addicted to will be there and I'm not sure how to approach them. This small voice in the back of my head is whispering in one long repeating run-on sentence: "Don't bother going since you'll only make a fool out of yourself, they are all more intelligent than you, you'll never be able to hold your own with all these people, they discuss meaningful things that you will never understand, they don't care about you or your little piece of digitalia, you are insignificant and they know that you're alive, you don't matter in their worlds, they are so far above you that you can't stand on the same level as them, why are you going to even attempt to try, you will fail..."  Heh. Damn that little voice; damn my childhood fear and shyness that likes to pop up at the most unconvenient times to aggravate me. I'm hoping to purge myself of that damn voice at the gym through exhaustion. Honestly, I don't think it will be a problem but we shall see. If it proves to be correct...Well...At least I would have met the minds behind the pixellated thoughts that I read on a daily basis.   Hmmm.... Is there anyway I could plug this party any more?   urlLink     Nope, not at all.  >:)   If you will be attending the party and are curious as to who I am... I'll be the chick who is with the  urlLink guy  in the  black army hat .

So young, 3, 4, 5 (?) year olds, their parents dressing them up in fatigues with toy guns and grenade accessories; 7, 8, 9 (?) year old girl being paraded around with fake exploses strapped to her small body. What the hell are you doing?! What is your damn problem?! They're CHILDREN! Children who should be enjoying their childhood, going to school, running around without a care in the world...imagining what they will be when they grow up and playing with their friends. But no, you created this ridiculous war and ripped the innocence away from your children, trying to turn them into monsters like you. Bastards, you've succeeded; when teenagers feel that their lives are so horrible, so unimportant and non-consequential...when they have lost all hope for a real life and feel that they have nothing left to give to this world except the deaths of others by taking their own, you have succeeded. They should know nothing of this so young; all they want is the love and acceptance of their families, to make them proud. This is what you show them, tell them? "If you love us and want to make us proud, strap on this belt of explosives and go blow up that building." Disgusting. So young and already you're trying to stuff their heads with meaningless hate.   Die. Just die; kill yourselves quietly, take the gun to your own head and pull the trigger. Don't send your children to do your dirty work. Just because you feel you were cheated and had, don't force your children to do the same. NORMAL PARENTS WANT ONLY THE BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN; THEY WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO  GO FORTH IN THE WORLD AND EXCEL, TO FULFILL THEIR DREAMS AND LIVE BETTER LIVES THAN WHAT THEY THEMSELVES AS CHILDREN HAVE LED.   So kill yourselves. Give your children the chance to dream, to LIVE...without your meddling. The deserve at least a CHANCE at LIFE.

      Yeah I hate 1-line blog updates; still there's no other real way to do this...  I know I'm late on this [but so is my WSJ "Best of the Web" email -- by 2 days!!! AAAAHHH!!!] and it's probably happened countless of other times [and I must have missed them...sorry!] -- Anyway, congrats to  urlLink Mr. Den Beste  for making the WSJ's Best of the Web email on the 12th.   Nice to see good things happen to good people.

      I'm tired. Let me revise that statement; more like  weary . Bone-weary, soul-weary, life-weary; just  weary . Add to that: frustrated and angry. Yet...I was right the first time. I'm  tired .    ¤¤¤  I'm tired of being everyone's emotional-baggage check; I have enough of my own emotionally-charged psychological issues to muddle through and attempt to resolve,  thankyouverymuch .    ¤¤¤  I'm tired of being the way-station, the connecting flight; the middle-ground-person you come to so you can come to grips with yourself and get yourself in check before moving on to bigger, better people.   ¤¤¤  I'm tired of the assumption that I'm blind to what is going on around me because I:  A.) Cut through the bullshit, ignore it and get to the heart of the problem without saying a word. B.) Don't feel the need to immediately comment about everything that I see happening around me. C.) Take the time to try to see the situation from every angle before making a decision. Or... D.) I just don't care about what's going on. [*gasp!* the  HORROR! ]   ¤¤¤  I'm tired of people trying to pull wool over my eyes because they believe them to be sightless anyway.   ¤¤¤  I'm tired of being the honorable mention ribbon, the consolation prize; "Thanks for playing, sorry you didn't get what you wanted, but here you go, take  her . Better than nothing, right...?"    ¤¤¤  I'm tired of my strength, character, will, resolve, personality and intelligence being constantly underestimated and/or questioned.     ¤¤¤  I'm tired of people asking me if I have better things to do or somewhere else to be; tired of being treated like the child who wandered too close to the adults-only table during dinner and disturbed the discussion. Add in the humiliation I get when they tell me this, the message boiling down to: "Why don't you just go off somewhere, dream your little dreams, observe the psychology of the world around you and leave the rest of us to our lofty intellectual discussions?" So my emotional/intuitive nature = unintellectual/stupid?  Heh, that's nice; my eyes see what's going on, my mind comes to the right conclusions, but because I've been smacked down one too many times, there's no way I'm going to say a damn thing now.  So, because I cannot sit down and talk about the goings-on in sports today, have a discussion on the labyrinthine world of politics or predict how the stock market is going to close, this immediately tags me as stupid? I have no love for sports; watching  some  sports on TV is fun, but I can't do that religiously and follow one team fanatically. Politics is intriguing to me, but I believe that it would take me too much time to learn everything I would need to know in order to make an informed opinion on what is going on. Also, I don't believe that I have the patience for the daunting task of sifting through/making sense of all the different groups/factions/sides/parties/etc./whatever and learning all the political jargon that comes with the territory. As for the stock market? I can read the financial section of the newspaper without a "translator", so I guess I'm better than most people in that area. I still have my opinions on the previous topics but no one cares about them because I've already been labeled as stupid and unintellectual. I'd rather have the label "uninformed" stuck on me; that at least implies that there is still hope for me yet, but apparently there is no hope.   It's just  wonderful  to see myself so highly thought of.

      I went to the city with Nick to see the Tribute in Light; waited for it to be shut off at 11:00pm, but those in charge decided to leave them on until dawn. Of course there was no mention of this whatsoever anywhere, so leaving was the option....   ...but I saw the Pillars.  It's all good.

      From what I read in the newspaper yesterday, tonight is the last night that the Tribute in Light will be seen in NYC's sky. I'm going to try to see it from the observatory deck of the Empire State; if that fails, I'm just gonna ride the E to the end and see it from the ground. I don't care how/where I see it, just as long as I  see it .   This isn't exactly related, but I signed the  urlLink petition . After  urlLink reading what happened , it was necessary. Read it over yourself and decide whether you want to add your name to the list...  Well, I have more to write, but I just can't bring myself to do so just yet; I'll try to continue later after I see the Pillars.

      Bleh. Well Blogger decided to send my nice long post into digital oblivion. That rots; please bear with me.  Ever run into someone completely unexpected? This happened to me today; I was in Borders talking to some friends of mine and drinking my chai when I turned around and found myself face to face with my old "first-year" English professor from my second college. While this might not  sound  like much, it was to me; he is one of the few professors whom I respect and admire. Plus, he's the one who has encouraged me to continue to follow my dreams, do what I love and be true to myself  other people be DAMNED . It was nice talking to him again and getting caught up with everything that's been happening in his life.  I've recently rediscovered the power of spoken word; since I never find the time to write things down I've been walking around with a mini-tape recorder to tape some of my random thoughts. So far it's come in handy many times, not just for my thoughts but also for class; I've found that my Systems Analysis professor makes  sense  once I listen to his lecture over again. [His heavy Russian accent, thick lisp and vocal monotone makes his lectures difficult to sit through and understand.]   On a completely different note, there's a blogparty being planned and yeap, I'm going to this one, drinking my damn Guinness and hopefully meeting some of the people whose blogs I read. On a side note, "The Musical Box" [the place where the party is happening] is apparently home to some  really hot chicks  [...and with that said, I am  already  deafened by the noise that the stampede which the feet of many males will create...heh!]     urlLink

      Somewhere in Minnesota there's a place called  urlLink Bemidji  (try pronouncing THAT name if you're an outsider like me!) which is home to a  urlLink college  where  urlLink Professor Morgan  teaches a first-year English course whose focus/major project for the semester is  urlLink observing blogs . The only reason why I know this is because one day, I checked my site stats and found a hit from their  urlLink "e-classroom" . My extreme curiosity got the best of me so I  just had  to sign up to their e-classroom and see what all the fuss was about! Apparently,  urlLink Margaret Jirik  had considered my blog for her project and others from her class decided to stop by for a visit. After reading over her posts, my next thought was, "A class that focuses on blogging? Interesting... must...learn...more... " and I sent an email to the professor asking him to clarify and explain his class to me. He was courteous, pleasant and quick to respond and from his reply I could see that he's a very organized and creative professor.   So far the class looks interesting; I'm starting to take an active part within it as a student has decided to take me up on my offer to help while Professor Morgan has given me the go-ahead to post and reply to his students as I see fit in order to help them with their research. I'm pretty happy with that.    :D    Let's see how this goes...

      Horrible day turned out OK; news at 11.  Heh!  So I hopped on the train to begin my commute to school and not two stops into the commute there was an announcement over the speakers: "There has been a fatality in Mineola so this train is going to be delayed in Farmingdale for an unknown amount of time."  Lovely. I slept through it all and woke up in Penn Station; the last time the train passed by a station where "a fatality" occurred, you could still see the blood and pieces of once-human on the tracks and that was  not  an experience I wanted to relive. When I finally arrived at school, I immediately took my E-Comm test; I feel pretty good about it even though I know that I made two stupid mistakes on it. Ah well, after that train ride, I'm glad I was able to even get through the test. I even managed to stay awake during my Systems Analysis (trust me, that is  quite  an accomplishment) and I even had fun during my C++ tutoring session...So my day was looking up.  I get home, eat salad, go over my day, talk to some friends on irc and check my email when I suddenly realize that the screen name of an old friend of mine from BU was online...So of course I immediately shut down my emailer and IM him...and we talked for a good long while on both IM and the phone!  It was insanely awesome; I  can't even begin to describe  how awesome this was for me...   :D  So all in all, a shitty day turned out to be awesome.  Excellent.  More tomorrow; right now my bed is calling me...

           Well, sorry for the lack of posts, but on Saturday I had a scare with my dog, Lucky. She had what is medically referred to as a "minor" stroke; while she was outside, she suddenly collapsed on the lawn due to the fact that she lost control of her muscles and her complete right side was paralyzed for a few moments. When she came to, she still didn't have control of her right side but she tried walking around anyway...she would be able to make it a few steps before toppling over and spasming...that was hearbreaking. I had to pick her up, bring her  inside and place her down on her bed. After a few hours, she was able to hobble around without collapsing and by nightfall she was able to walk again, seemingly without any trouble. All yesterday, whenever she was outside, she went back to her usual attempts and running down every squirrel that caught her eye; so it  looks  like she made a full recovery. A miracle on Easter...almost makes me want to believe. Even so, she has an appointment with the vet tomorrow...Errrr....later today.  And on that note, I'm going to get ready for school now...hopefully I'll be able to update during C++.

        Don't know whether to be outraged or to laugh my ass off...    Something about the title of this article amuses the hell out of me... urlLink Startled marines find Afghan men all made up to see them !!! News at 11!!!!  Sounds like something straight out of the tabloids:    BRITISH marines returning from an operation deep in the Afghan mountains spoke last night of an alarming new threat - being propositioned by swarms of gay local farmers.  ~~~~~~~  "It was hell," said Corporal Paul Richard, 20. "Every village we went into we got a group of men wearing make-up coming up, stroking our hair and cheeks and making kissing noises."    Well anway, inquiring minds want to know...  Heh!   >:)

        ARRGH and a Hell Yeah...    So I'm reading over the current "issue" of WSJ's  urlLink Best of the Web  when I come across this wonderful     article discussing the  urlLink agony that survivors of suicide attacks face ; they have the actual CT scans showing you the nails and shrapnel that have become imbedded in the survivors' bodies. And then people  wonder  why I call these monsters  scum .  But being the fact that I don't like leaving you with bad things, here is something that I find hilarious...Although you might not get it, since you don't know him...But I'll post it up anyway... urlLink Attack of the Herblets !!!    :)    OK I'll now return you to your regularly scheduled surfing while I go enjoy and draw strength from the loud thunderstorm that's currently raging outside...    >:)

        Yay for Sylvia.    Apparently this kid who I completely hated during my time in Boston has kept a livejournal. Heh. The kid was a self-serving, egotistical, arrogant, short-sighted, ignorant dumbfuck looking for instant gratification and so full of himself...and he had no idea as to why most people weren't cool with him. Heh! Read over a few entries and well, I guess some things never change. Bleh. No love lost there; he annoyed the hell out of me. However he did have some funny i-quizzes that I took and c/p'd the results to  urlLink Feeding My Addicion . Gotta love that.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Anyway, there were so many different articles on the tribute for the last day of searching that I haven't had time to read them all...but as usual,  urlLink Pej has written a beautiful post  regarding it. Go read it. NOW. NOW!!!   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Some interesting/strange/ aroo ? things from around the blogosphere:  Two things to file under "What the FUCK?!": Apparently an  urlLink 11-year-old girl gave birth to her child by a 75-year-old man  in Connecticut [link via  urlLink Cut on the Bias ]; the father has said that he was "seduced" by the then-10-year-old. Kids giving birth to kids -- that poor child's gonna be one fucked up individual when she realizes just what has happened to her...Then again in a world where  urlLink Abercrombie & Fitch sells thongs to pre-teens  I guess anything is possible...  I'm not sure what to think about this sick article about a 15-year-old child prodigy who fell hard at the hands of her school's football team. [" urlLink Out of Control ", link via  urlLink Sullivan  under "Sexual Abuse and Sports"]. She was 15; out of her peer group, she was isolated and forced to be alone until she found "acceptance" when some football players decided to get "friendly" with her. It's sick because the school did nothing to help her in favor of building up their school's football program, but at the same time, when she was asked if something was going on, she said nothing was wrong. Read it for yourself. I'm not sure what to think.    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   This article about  urlLink photography of the WTC  [via  urlLink Vodkapundit ] made me think about my photographical work. I know for a fact that I couldn't go down and take pictures of the site...Hell, I couldn't be near the site without nearly breaking down every time. The only thing I tried to take pictures of was the Tribute in Light. But I know what the writer is talking about; some of the pictures that I have seen are...I don't know. Awe-inspiring. They hit me on two levels; I'm either awed by the beauty of the photograph that stands as a marker for those who died and awed by the fact that someone dared to take such a picture. I know I couldn't.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   For something funnier [I'm sure a lot of you will be dancing the happy dance at this news],  urlLink Jay Reading reports  that  urlLink Ren & Stimpy are making a comeback . I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry; that show was the bane of my existance when I was younger, but now that I'm older I can appreciate the hilarity of it all. Hrrrm...  Last funny thing comes from the caffeinated  urlLink Banana Counting Monkey ;  urlLink What Women Want in the Star Wars Universe !  I fell out of my chair laughing at #9, #8, #7, and of course...#1. >:)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Joy! I like the happier and funnier things in life. Nothing like talking to Sylvia to make me laugh my ass off...But now I think I'm going to log for a while, go outside and see the sunshine.   See you all later...

        Sick.    I wish I was had a copy of The Sun so I could read the article he was discussing, but either way  urlLink Clay still found it disgusting ; a story about how a father spelled out his hopes for his son [the suicide bomber who set himself off in an ice cream shop]...How he wished his son would have been a  nuclear bomb  instead of a  normal bomb .  These are the  people  scum we are dealing with here.    Normal  parents want the best for their children and usually discuss their futures with pride; dreams and hopes that their children will be successful and happy with what they do with their lives. Since, who knows? Maybe their child will be the doctor that cures cancer or a future Olympian.   It makes me sick and angry to see these  people  scum sacrifice their children for a cause that they believe in. I don't have kids, but I sure as hell know that if my kids were in danger, nothing would stop me from keeping them safe. Nothing. I'd make sure that they were safe at all costs, even if my life is forfeit. If it was my life or theirs, I'd die. Pure and simple. I'm sure that most parents would agree with me.   If the future is so important to these so-called parents, let  them  strap on the bombs so that their children can grow and decide the future for themselves. In fact, I think these so-called parents should gather together celebrate their hatred and blow themselves up in one big bang. They don't deserve to live.

        Feelin' the Blogospheric love...    Dave from  urlLink Wake Me Up On Judgement Day  has decided to  urlLink send some linkage love my way  because of some of the things I have written...Well, kindasorta... ; )  But also because of my picture in the top left hand corner of my blog. Yeap Dave, those are  my  lips. :)  He's also being really nice and repeating my call for help on my permalinks issue...So when you're done here, why don't you stop by his blog and say hello? His blog has been hanging out in my "Neat-o outspoken political critics" links section for awhile now, but if you're a lazy bum and want instant gratification, you can click  urlLink here .   Also, Jimmy Olsen of  urlLink The Ends of the Earth  wrote me an email saying hello and other nice things...His blog always makes me laugh...So let me just say, "Heya Jim!" and if point you in his blog's direction too...Again, if you're too lazy to even  look  at my linklist [although you  should  because there are a myriad of other nice blogs there! :P ] or even too lazy to move your mouse up a teeny bit to click on his blog's name you can click  urlLink here .  Bum.  ; )   One more person I have to say hello to is Jade from  urlLink Reflective Lens . Thanks for trying to help with my permalinks issue...I guess I'm just blind to what the problem is because I'm getting so fed up with it. :(    More instant gratification is found  urlLink here .

        For some reason...    This article about the  urlLink predicted post-9/11 baby boom  really hasn't gotten much attention; so far I've only seen two people discuss it. I like what  urlLink Pej wrote  about it; he gets it right on, but I'm not too sure what to think about  urlLink Denton 's viewpoint. *shrug*  Sorry, I guess I'm just more along the lines of what Pej was thinking.  As for me? I love kids. Kids are wonderful! ...As long as their mommies come back soon to get them. Right now. NOW~!  I honestly can't see myself as a mother anytime soon; hell I can barely take care of myself, how would I expect to take care of a kid? *shudder*   One day though. One day I would love to have a daughter, to bring joyous fear into the world. She will be beautiful, intelligent, strong-minded and she will not take shit from anyone. I would love to see my daughter wreak havoc and have fun and break hearts and be successful and live a wonderful life.   One day...But not now.    But when that day comes... fear .     >:)     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    UPDATE [5/30 - 4:45pm]:  Well, add in one more person who has decided to talk about this... urlLink Clay says  it's not gonna be that big of a deal.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤

        Amusement...

Ah well,  I  found it hilarious!

        Hello fellow NYC Bloggers [and the rest of you who are curious] !    I had received the email to join this "webring-that's-not-a-webring" early yesterday afternoon; being that I spend a lot of time in The City and Queens, I figured I'd respond to the nice email and see if I would be accepted. After a while I decided to hang out with my brother and his SO so that kept me away from the house for the rest of the day, leaving me unable update my blog. Of course after I got home, the people at Blogger decided to upgrade their systems and whatnot so I was unable to do a damn thing with my blog...But anyway...         Welcome to all of you who have decided to come see what my little piece of digitalia is all about! I hope you enjoy your stay; as you can see, one of my hobbies is playing with Photoshop so I decided to create a new banner for myself. :)   Have fun! :)

        Why is Blogger messing with my posts?    I've been trying to fix my damn permalinks since yesterday since they don't fucking work. And now, I tried fixing my last two posts from yesterday, only to have them republished with today's date. What the fuck is going on?!  This is getting to be fucking ridiculous. I don't like it when my shit gets messed up. I know my shit isn't important to anyone but me, but still, it's pissing me the fuck off. Arrgh!  AND HAVE I MENTIONED THAT THE PERMALINKS  STILL DON'T FUCKING WORK ?!?!?!

        A Small Tirade (?) for  urlLink Sasha .     [Originally posted on May 27th, sometime around 5ish -- I feel the need to say this since Blogger decided to fuck with it and republish it with today's date for some ungodly reason. I'm really starting to hate Blogger now...]   I wasn't going to say anything; I wasn't going to get into it. The memories still hurt. The images are burned into my skull. My anger still smolders. I figured, who would give a damn? I'm no one special;  urlLink unlike others , my opinions don't matter and I'm not a  urlLink coherent writer  with the right words to move people. All I have is myself. But fuck it. I will say something because it needs to be said, if not for anything but to say it and get it off my conscious. Today of all days, because my heart is heavy even as my soul rages against the images that are in my head.   I made the picture in the previous post for the "front page" of my school's online newspaper a few days after the tragedy. I needed to  do something , to  create something , no matter how small, to try to work through the pain and try to conquer such blatant destruction, knowing full well that the pain would never leave. I remember that day, waking up, hearing my mom hysterically crying and turning on the TV just in time to see the second plane smash into the tower. I remember being fuzzyheaded with sleep watching the horror, not really comprehending, silently thanking God that I wasn't in the city that day, right before I woke up.Then everything hit me all at once and I realized that this was actually happening.   The cell phone still worked for a few...before everyone who knew I was going to school close to the city started trying to call to see if I was still alive. In between that I was trying to reach the people I knew in the city to make sure they were alive. I remember calling the different companies where my friends worked, no answers, no names, no nothing. Staying glued to the TV to see if I recognized any faces. Switching channels, hoping that I wouldn't see a body with a face I recognized. Continued calls to the different companies, telling them I was a cousin, a sister, anything to get information. Nothing. Half the time it was busy signals, the other half it was the recording, "All circuits are busy now, please try your call again later." Insanity. Pandemonium. Crying until my eyes felt like they were pouring blood instead of tears. Hatred, all-consuming hatred for the fuckers who did this. Sitting on the couch, feeling myself shaking with hatred and fear and outrage and horror and the burning desire for vengeance.  I remember the days after this. Taking the train to school; watching the solidarity between strangers as there was a group therapy session, as people recounted stories of co-workers and friends who were lost. Choking on the smell and the cloud of dust that lingered in the air. Constantly crying because there was no other response.  It seemed simpler back then. Cut and dry. You fucked with us. You killed our innocents. You will pay.   Now it's all convoluted; the politicians live up to their undecisiveness and their desire to hear their own voices. They talk when they should act, they second-guess themselves and ponder trivial meaningless crap while those who fucked with us run free. Before, they stood behind the military they sent out to do their jobs; now it seems like all has been forgotten while they ponder other issues that come to their attention.   It is time. Shut your mouths, politicians.  Either ACT, or let us fight.  Avenge those who died so that you can sit there and ponder your trivial meaningless crap.   I was not alive to witness the World Wars and I thank God for this. But I did see the Towers fall, and to hear those who survived through those wars call Ground Zero a warzone was devastating.  I saw a bumpersticker the other day that made me cry. It had a picture of the American flag and the words: "All Gave Some; Some Gave All" on it. With the memories in my head and a remembrance of the past, I thank those who gave the ultimate sacrifice...Be they Military or Civilian. I know they're being rewarded.          All Gave Some      Some Gave All      I know I will never forget.

        On a weird note...    I'm wondering why my titles are turning red. I thought maybe I forgot to close my HTML tags somewhere, but after checking them all, nope. They're all happy and closed. Weirdness. I also noticed that my italicized blockquotes have decided to turn red as well...  This is annoying; I don't like it when things randomly decide to do things by themselves. I guess I'll chalk it up to a weird Blogger error or something. Grrrr. Just,  GRRRRrrrrrr .   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   UPDATE [1:52]:   I've just noticed that it decides to turn red when the post gets old. The current post stays normal, but once it is no longer current, it decides to turn red.   ...Yet my original coding hasn't changed; when I go to the edit function it remains the same. Weirdness!  Oh well, I guess I'll just learn to love red. *shrug*  Grrrrr...  ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤

        Interesting stuff...    Earlier this morning I found that  urlLink Glenn  had added in comments to his site...and I rejoiced! But now I see it was just for  urlLink one post . Too bad, I think he's one person that  should  have comments, since a million people go to his site daily; I'd love to see their instant reactions to what he posts up there [since most people usually share their more in-depth answers to what he posts on their blogs].   Someone from IRC  urlLink posted this link  at noon and made a comment along the lines of: " Total Recall here we come!" I read it over, laughed and shrugged it off. After all, I missed the link in the post that led to the actual article. Then I went to  urlLink Drudge  and and apparently, what the kid posted was true...There was the link in bold font, underneath a large picture of Mars:  urlLink Ice reservoirs have been found on Mars !!! Damn. This is insane. Well, now I'm gonna have to rent Total Recall and see what's in store for us...       ;)     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    UPDATE [1:25 PM]:   LOL!  I started this post at around 1, but with all my checking [and re-checking] of links [to make sure they were the right ones] I just missed posting about the Mars ice before  urlLink Glenn . Damn my slowness! LOL, oh well. And apparently he has the abillity to pick and choose which of his posts get comments...Too bad. This might be good in the long run [since the smaller articles won't need commenting] but maybe he'll mis-judge which articles people want to comment on...*shrug* Well it's his blog.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤

        And Fleet Week continues...    ...And I was supposed to go again today with my parents, but they have decided to stay home today since the weatherman is predicting thundershowers. Either way...    HELL YEAH!!!!  WOOOOOOOOO!!!!    *dances around*  So my day of Fleet Week was pretty damn cool; Nick came with me [with little coersion ;) ] and I was a pretty happy chick. The weather cooperated [but my skin didn't since it staunchly refused to even get the  tiniest bit  darker, blaargh!] and the sun shone down without any problems. Of course, there were  waaaaay  too many   people milling about; the lines were insane! But I was happy. The first thing I saw was the Coast Guard drug dog demonstration, where handlers put a yellow and a black lab through their paces for the crowd. The kids were excited...Hell, I was too since the black lab looked just like my Lucky did as a pup. :D  One thing I have to say though was there were search checkpoints everywhere -- You had to walk through metal detectors and get your bags [almost,  almost  typed in carry-ons, lol] checked before getting near any of the boats/events/etc. The best part was watching the simulated Marine pier raid... Damn  those guys move quick! I know I'd be freaking out if someone said to me,  "Here, take all this heavy gear, slide down a rope from a  hovering helicopter , break out your weapon, secure the area and  then  carry all your stuff  plus  the heavy ass rope you slid down from towards the main part of the pier."   I'd be catatonic at the "slide down a rope from a  hovering helicopter " part; everything else just looked so cool. I give those guys a hell of a lot of credit doing what they do; in fact, I give ALL of the military people there a hell of a lot of credit...but  especially  the chicks. Mike, if you ever want to see the Eptiome of the Tough Chick, take a look at those chicks who are in the military. Damn! I look at them with awe and respect. Those are chicks you just don't fuck with, but they're not butch and all in your face about it; they don't demand respect because it's just inherent. These women have a style and a quiet grace all their own and their elegance just enhances their strength. Yeah. They were cool. I respect them.   On a completely personal and selfish note...and I can do this, since hey! It's  my  blog...  It's  all about  guys in fatigues....and there were  many  of them milling about. Mmmm hmmm! 'Nuff said.    >:)    Hopefully it will be nice on Monday for the Memorial Day Ceremony at the pier...That's one event I'd like to see.  And now, it's time for a nap. Whee!

         urlLink Friday Five  thingy returns...    And it's about the thing I do best.  Dreaming.  HEH!    >:)     1. What's the last vivid dream that you remember having?   Last night. I always have vivid dreams; I tend to remember most of them too. Some I don't care to remember, others I never want to forget.    2. Do you have any recurring dreams?   Yeap!! Some of the dreams I have are like episodes; there's one in which I'm sort of an assassin/spy/hitwoman and every so often I get a "new episode".    3. What's the scariest nightmare you've ever had?   I'm not going to tell and for a few reasons: a.) it's  way  too personal b.) it's not something I'd be comfortable sharing c.) someone out there who hates me can use it against me   4. Have you ever written your dreams down or considered it? Why or why not?   Yes. I've written down some of the ones that I never want to forget.    5. Have you ever had a lucid dream? What did you do in it?    Yes, many times; I dream lucidly often. I call them "learning dreams" -- Usually these dreams answer a question or solve a problem; I learn what I need to do in these dreams. There's way too many of them to recount here, so I'll just leave that alone. :)

        OH MY GOD!!!! I WANT IT!!! NOW!!!!    Oh my God, I have to have this. While most chicks my age fawn over people like Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, I'm ALL about  urlLink Peter Wingfield . "WHO?!" you ask? Well, if you ever watched  urlLink Highlander  the TV series, you'd remember a character called  urlLink Methos . He used to be part of the 4 horsemen, the oldest living Immortal at 5,000, helps out that pesky annoying little Immortal named Duncan MacLeod and gets him out of trouble...You know, that Methos! Anyway even if you never watched the show, the thing with Immortals is that you can't kill them...Unless you're another Immortal and you decapitate them. Once the dead Immortal's head is severed from his/her body, the survivng Immortal faces the Quickening [in which the surviving Immortal is imbued with the power/life force/etc of the dead Immortal] thereby strengthening the survivng Immortal. In any case, every Immortal has his or her own signature sword: Duncan MacLeod carries a samurai sword and that one is pretty much the most well known one in Highlander history [besides the MacLeod claymore that Connor used to mark his love Heather's grave].   More can be found at  urlLink the official Highlander site .  Anyway so a friend of mine on IRC found something that he thought I'd find interesting -- They are now selling  urlLink a replica of Methos' sword !!!!! All I have to say is... urlLink I WANT IT !!!   Now. NOW!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's actually a  urlLink package of Methos stuff :  the sword, a video, a picture, and [of course] a certificate of authenticity.    Whee!!!!!!!!    :D    Oh my God, this is just too fucking cool. I have to get it. I don't care, it will just have to be a very belated birthday gift to myself!!!!  Unless, of course, someone out there in Internet-land wants to be  really really nice to me  and get it for me?  But since I doubt that would happen, I'll just drool over the pictures and scrape up some pennies. And wait.   [i want it!!!!!]   AAAAHHHH!!!!

        Today is another [better] day...    Still haven't recuperated from my lack of sleep, but things are looking better today.  urlLink This poll  just made me laugh my ass off and apparently someone else out there shares my  urlLink photographical interest in eyes ...Eyes have always been my main love in my photographical work; my favorite picture still remains  urlLink my father's eye . And, of course, all my self-portraits are of my eyes. They're two of the three things I actually like about myself [even though I wish the coloring was different].   Today is a better day. I'll post more when I get back...        ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   So I'm back, and I'm semi-tired and everyone is getting down with changing their site's appearance. I love the seeing the new colors on both  urlLink fixing what's been broken  [hope you feel better SG!] and  urlLink Cold Fury  [Mike, it's ALL about that new logo of yours! :) ]

        Another day, yet another bomb scare...    This time at my school. Imagine my happiness; suddenly half of the school is mysteriously "off-limits" and the place is crawling with cops. The dogs weren't called in so I guess it wasn't that serious, but still...It was scary. Apparently a "questionable package" was left on the second floor of my school; I'm assuming they decided to play it safe, since the school was in session and it is also literally within walking distance to the Queensboro bridge. Wonderful. So there was my heart attack for the day. Heh.  And, my exhaustion finally caught up to me...I normally sleep on the train coming home, but usually I wake up around Deer Park. On bad days, I wake up as they're announcing, "Ronkonkoma, last stop...Last stop on this train is Ronkonkoma!" Today however, I must have been dead asleep. And apparently my joke that I'm easily overlooked has proven itself to be true; no one noticed that I was sleeping on the train. Today I woke up at Deer Park...but as the train was heading  back  to the city!  Wonderful. Imagine my joy.   So I had to get off at Wyandanch and wait for a half hour for the next train; the conductor was in shock that he overlooked me. Heh. Whatever. Fuck you too. Heh.   I'm tired. I think I'm just gonna go to bed and save myself the trouble...Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day. After all, it's  urlLink FLEET WEEK!!!!!   Whee!!!!    Yeah.

        Too much coffee...    Can't sleep.  Must type.   Still reading over my usual political-type blogs; I'm coming to the conclusion that there are  way too many  links in my "favorites" folder named "Blogs I Like". Heh.  Was visiting  urlLink Pej' s website when I came upon  urlLink this . I like Pej; he's one of my favorite political-type bloggers because he writes in an engaging, inclusive way. Yeah, he tackles some serious issues, and sometimes some boring ones too, but somehow he makes even the boring ones interesting. He makes you think, even if you aren't in agreement with him and I like his style. Now what this other guy said was pretty raw; after checking out his own blog, it's more of the same, including other people as well. Pej states that he isn't the only one whom this guy dislikes:   Incidentally,  Marc  Mr. Jealous lumped me in with Andrew Sullivan, Stephen Green, Brooke Schreier, and Scott Ganz has bloggers he doesn't like.     [Yeap, I changed the quote around a bit.]  I guess Mr. Jealous follows the thought of: if you can't get fame based on your talent and merit, might as well rely on notoriety.  I know we're all entitled to our opinions, but when the basis of your blog currently revolves around trying to knock down other bloggers...That's low. At least this guy didn't stoop down to O'Reilly's level [as in, when O'Reilly was being interviewed on the radio and decided to call Drudge a crackwhore and sais that Drudge should be killed].  My thoughts? This guy's obviously jealous of others' success and wants to get his site on the map. Pej linked to him; I got suckered into checking it out as you have seen [and I'm sure everyone else who likes Pej did the same to see what kind of blog the person who is railing against him keeps]...Which probably played directly into what Mr. Jealous wanted. Honestly? I walked away from his site unimpressed. Curious to see what it looks like? I'm sure you are, but I'm not gonna link to it and fall for his trick again. However, if you want to get an idea of what it looked like, you can click  urlLink here . Trust me, it's the same; just that Mr. Jealous sprinkled in a few colors, pictures, and [of course] links here and there. Add into the fact that  urlLink John Ingram 's site is  meant  to be amusing while Mr. Jealous...just isn't.   Anyway...  Pej? I know I'm nobody in the blogosphere [and unlike Mr. Jealous, I'm content with where I'm at], but keep up the good work. A lot of people love your site and your style. Next time he tries to attack you, pay him no mind; he just wants attention.

        On a happier note...    Glenn Reynolds, the blogospherically [with a nod to "normal" media as well] revered blogger has decided to move away from blogspot as well as revamp his site. Go  urlLink take a look  at it right now. Right this second!  I was wondering when he was going to do that. The loss of Blogger service earlier today severely pissed me off, and my little blog isn't even  remotely  as important as his is; I can just imagine how frustrated and pissed  he  was over it, since he updates his blog many times a day.  Either way, nice job. Someday soon I'll be inspired to completely redo  my  little piece of digitalia...    :)

        Sick motherfuckers    I was vainly hoping that it wasn't true, that it was just a rumor, that they had more decency than this. But someone out there really does have the David Pearl videotape up for viewing. I was wrong.   urlLink Stephen Green  hasn't seen it, but he found out what was on the tape through another blogger,  urlLink Damian Penny  who  has  seen it.   A piece of this Damian's post is as follows:  Find these people. Hunt them down and kill them. Kill them all. Kill anyone so warped that they would do this. These people are a cancer on the earth. They represent all that is evil. They cannot be negotiated with. You cannot reason with them. They want to perpetuate a genocide against the Jews, then the Americans, then Americans' allies, and ultimately anyone who does not accept their sick view of the world. I don't care how poor these people are. I don't care what kind of government they grew up under. This is  fucking unacceptable .    As for me?  No , I haven't seen it. I know myself too well; if I happen to stumble across it and view this atrocity, I'd immediately find myself in a fit of murderous rage. I don't need to see it. I already hate these motherfuckers who would dare to take it upon themselves to kill thousands of good people in the WTC as well as sacrifice their children and smack down their women. Fuck them. I agree with this Damian guy; this is fucking unacceptable. But I don't agree that they should be executed once they are found. No, they should be maimed and tortured and brought to the brink of death...and then revived and allowed to recuperate and live. Repeat process. Many times. Fuck them. Fuck them all. They gave up their rights and gave up their humanity when they decided to commit this atrocity, and all the others that came before. They are worse than animals. They are lower than scum. They do not deserve death. They deserve torture and pain to occupy their depraved minds.  So maybe I am a horrible person for saying that. But you know what? Whatever. I am a vengeful person. I carry grudges a long time. They killed someone close to me.   These people may not give a damn about their families as they advocate the sacrifice of their children, but I'm  damn sure  that the Pearls are grieving even now. Right this second.

        And...    What was up wth Blogger?! For the better part of today I couldn't do a damn thing with it...In fact, when I tried to see my site, it showed me a stark white page with three words: "Page not found."  Lovely. I was slightly annoyed seeing that. Ok, maybe slightly annoyed is a bad choice of words. I was seeing   red   and was pretty much infuriated. Blaaargh!  Well, at least it's working now. Whee. Crisis over, anger managed.  Excellent.

        Joy.      So I'm listening to the Hannity show when he interrupts himself at around 3:28 pm with a news flash that the  urlLink next possible terrorist targets  are the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge [thanks to  urlLink Drudge  for the link] but that the NYPD haven't issued a Terrorist Warning just yet. Of course, the news made them step up security around those important monuments, but still...This is insane! Grrrr. I want to rip the heads off of these would-be terrorists.   But on a funnier note, there is now a  urlLink featherless chicken  that's being bred for food. Of course, this has all the animal rights activists up in arms, but you know what I think? Who really cares. It's food. Yummy! Heh, they're calling them "broilers"...MMMMMMMMmmmm....Broiled chicken...  Excuse me. I need to go eat dinner now.    [...Anyone else remember that old commercial..."I feel like chicken tonight, like chicken tonight....Chicken tonight!"  Heeheehee!]

        Whee.    So Mike has a new domain for his wonderful site,  urlLink Cold Fury ; it still looks mostly the same, but parts of the set-up are different...such as the the links section.  ...And YAY! I get a gold star!  Thanks Mike! You just made me giddy...    :D

        Eyeballs.    I wish there was a way for the eye doctor to have changed the colors of my eyes after he did the LASIK surgery on them. I have brown eyes and I hate them. How boring of a color can you get? Brown. Wow. When I was younger I used to have solid black eyes...I loved it! I would creep a lot of people out because they had no idea where my pupils ended and my irises began...  But then they started changing, lightening to this ugly brown color that I've been stuck with ever since. This completely sucks.  While I know I had no way of inheriting my father's eyes, that would have been damn cool -- He's got a base of green with a whole bunch of different colored flecks (grey, blue and yellow) and the outer ring of his eyes has a slate blue color to it. They fucking rule!  But I got stuck with brown. Bleh... Bleh Brown. Boring Brown. Blurry Brown. Blaargh...  I have the black hair, why couldn't have recessive genetics tweaked themselves to give me blue or green eyes? I would have LOVED either...Or a weird combination like my dad has...or the shifting colors like an old friend of mine used to have...or even the stunning wonder of amber eyes. But no, I got stuck with BROWN.  This just sucks.   Blaargh.

        Recuperation? Somewhat. Now back to the daily grind...    Yeah, I haven't been getting much sleep this whole past week, and while two nights of it were worth it [he knows why], the others...well...just  weren't , to put it plainly. However a few good things did happen. Some I won't talk about here, but others I will...Such as  urlLink  Fleet Week!  . Whee! My good friend is coming home for a little bit; while a  urlLink good many ships  are attending, to me,  urlLink his is the most impressive . That is just the coolest thing happening right now.   :)    Also, about three semesters ago, my friend discovered  urlLink Inklink!  [a game of pictionary] via one of his friends, while I discovered  urlLink DFILM  [a place where you can make your own little Flash movie] through my friend Jack. We swapped amusing links; I made three movies, he made two and we teamed up to annoy the hell out of the other players in Inklink!. I used to have the links to my old movies, but they have since been lost within digitial oblivion...and then I lost the link to DFILM since it was in my favorites folder at school. Heh. I finally found it again and...joy!  Yesterday, for some reason, something inside of me said, "Violin. Music. Play.  Now ." After a looooooong time away, I picked up my violin, tuned it to my piano, and started to play; I was astounded at how much I remembered. I guess some things you really  don't forget . But damn, some of those passages were hard...Oh well. Just have to work on it. I've decided to never allow myself to let that go for such a long time ever again. The music is in my soul, and my soul is the music.   :D     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   And of course, what would a post to my blog be like without something stupid to laugh over and make fun of? Yeah yeah, I know, not much. Heh. So a bunch of Latino critics [with a whole lot of time on their hands and a penchant for seeing problems where there are none] have decided to  urlLink attack and criticize  urlLink Star Wars: Attack of the Clones  for "racial sterotyping"  against the Latino community. Here are a few excerpts of the stupidity:  1.)  Latino critics in particular charge his latest Star Wars epic, Episode II: Attack of the Clones, toys with American paranoia about Mexican immigration with its cloned army of swarthy lookalikes who march in lockstep by the tens of thousands, and ultimately end up serving as Darth Vader's white-suited warriors.    2.)  "He looked totally Latino," says Martina Guzman, a Detroiter who's managing a State House election campaign.     "And his kid," says Wayne State history professor Jose Cuello, referring to the young Boba Fett, "looked even more Latino."     It reminds Cuello a little bit of "those Reagan ads in the 1980 campaign, that suggested if Nicaragua went communist, you'd have wild-eyed Mexicans with guns running across the California border."       Like, are you  serious ?! He, like,  totally  looked Latino? Whoa! And his, like, kid too? That's like, totally wrong!    All I have to say is...  WHAT?!   God DAMN you people have a whole lot of time on your hands!!! I mean, give me a fucking break. Being that I, myself, come from a South American country and share that Spanish background with these people,  I can look at them and say [without any regret], "You people are fucking NUTS!!!"  ...And if you  dare  to lump me in with "the Latino category", I'll break your knees [and your arms, and puncture your lungs, and sever your head from your body] because even  with  my Paraguayan heritage, you couldn't  pay me enough  to allow myself to be shuffled in with  that  crowd. I absolutely  hate  that Lah-TINE-ah accent that all the females of the group seem to carry...EWWWwwww...But I digress, and that's a rant in and of itself...  So there's some quality stupidity that we all can bond over in making fun of. Heh.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Now for some fun stuff: here's something that...well...I can't tell if it's wrong or not, but damn, it's hilarious!!!  urlLink Bush has a PET NICKNAME For Vladimir Putin ...I'm just...in awe. This is just too damn funny!   :D    And lastly, two things before I go [I'm going to be late for class...*sigh*]:  Bored of your normal health routine? Try the  urlLink Punk Rock Aerobics ...Only in Boston would this happen...Heh!   And keep an eye out for a new TV show...But that's not what's funny...the   urlLink original post and comments that follow   are what make it hilarious!  Okokok, I'm going now. Heh. See you all later.

        Finally...    So I finally finished the post I started yesterday morning. Heh. Took me long enough right? Oh well, it pissed me off and even as pissed off as I get, school has to come first so I can acquire this damn degree I've been working towards the past couple of years. Three more semesters; I can't wait. I have so many dreams, but it's hard to choose the path I want to follow. I know what I want to do, but is it feasibly possible? So many of my broken dreams litter the floor of my mind and they cast long shadows of doubt within me.     I dug my own hole once because I got hurt too many times; it was easy to let go, to give in, to lose hope. Self-imposed solitude was easy; you build up a strong wall, a guard,  and you don't get hurt because you don't let anyone in. I learned to love it because it was all I knew and had; it is so easy to let go and live like that. There were a few people who I let past the guard because we had long histories of friendship together, but they are not around anymore. Dead...or close to it. I remember them sometimes with a smile. They tried, but to me...What did it matter? What did I matter? Who cared? Not that many. I lived my life like that for a couple of years. You get comfortable...Too comfortable sometimes, and it gets to the point that when you have to be near other people it...just...hurts. You don't really know how to interact with them, nor do you really care to; they're more of a distraction and a reason for continuing your solitude. After a short time of being in a group, you feel a pressing urge to  leave , that need to slink away, to go off to one side and contemplate the serenity of being alone because you just can't handle being around groups of people anymore. There are times when I feel that old ache inside of me and I have to leave and be myself for a little while so I can just breathe and focus. There are times when that hole looks tempting and there's nothing that I want more than to crawl back into it and forget the world. But I refuse it because now there are more than a few people who I care about and make life worth living. People who remind you that yes, even after everything that has been said and done in this big shithole we call Earth, there still is a reason for living life. So it's hard to open up to people, hard to let them past that guard and show them who I really am because even after all these years, that hole is stll there, still a part of me and I remember all too well what it was like when the pain was inflicted and how easy it was to shut myself off from the world. Emotional scars run much deeper than physical ones, but given time and love, you can gain enough strength that even your emotional scars can be dealt with. So I'm scarred...and still kind of scared of what will happen. I regained hope and regained my grip on the reins of my life, but I know how hard it is to ignore the call of the hole. I know I'm not the only one, but damn at times it feels like I am. Who do you talk to about this? Unless the person who is listening to you has been there him- or herself, they won't understand what you are talking about and will only look at you like you're crazy [and alternately give you yet another reason to sink deeper into your hole]. Life is difficult and everyone has their own holes that they deal with, but it's hard to deal with it on your own. You lose sight of the things that drive you and make life worth living. Sometimes someone cares about you and gives enough of a damn about you to toss down a rope to help you...but whether you recognize that help depends on how deeply accustomed you have become to your hole. Does the rope hit you on the head and wake you up into climbing out or are you so enthralled with your creation that you ignore it? For me, I ignored it for a long time before something else happened that pissed me off enough to force me out; when I tried to return, I realized that rope had been there for a long time. Lucky for me it was still in good condition. Heh.     Yeah. I still feel that ache every now and then. That's when the old nagging feelings come back to haunt; you're worthless, you're pitiful, you're only going to get hurt, you're going to be left behind, you are nothing, so stay alone, stay protected, don't let them in or else they'll hurt you.     It's still hard to talk about it, but I'm getting better at talking...It's a little easier now because I know that I'm cared about and loved. The ache is starting to disappear.     Emotional scars run deeper than physical ones, but I still believe that given time and love you can gain the strength you need to deal with them.

        Ridiculous...    Again, the stupidity of some people bewilders me at times...A woman was fired from her job because even though she was given a crash course in Spanish and had a pretty good handle on the language, she transferred a call from a Spanish-speaker to someone else in her department who was fluent in the language. Apparently, that caller was her supervisor [who had disguised her voice] and her boss decided to fire the woman over this "incident". This all occurred in the Miami-Dade county of Florida.   All I have to say is...  WHAT  ?!  Now here's my thing: I don't care that Florida is now high in a Spanish-speaking population. I really don't. There shouldn't be bilingual signs and things of this nature. You moved here, speak the damn language. If you don't know English, learn enough so you can get by and then later focus on learning the language in its entirety.   This method was NORM for a damn long time so why should it change now? I don't remember where I read it [and unfortunately I don't have the article on hand either] but I  believe  it was [again] in Florida that one woman started her own crusade to get bilingual signs put in the airports since she noticed that Spanish-speaking people were having a hard time navigating through the airports. Ok, I can understand if they're tourists, but if they're coming here to  stay ... Learn the damn language !!! Is it honestly that hard? You're planning on spending the rest of your natural life here and English is necessary for your survival if you want to stay; the rest of the country speaks it and so should you.   Again, maybe I'm biased on this issue since my own parents struggled and fought to make a life of their own here. They came with a suitcase in hand, knowing "conversational English" as it was taught to them in school. It's been an uphill battle for them, but they worked through it and made a damn good life for themselves here. Both of them have strong accents, but they speak well considering it all; of course they have their small problems here and there with grammar and words, but they make their points known and it's a small thing to correct them when they forget. But they  tried  and made the effort to learn. They did not ask for handouts even though they struggled in the beginning. They strived for better and worked hard to gain it. And you know what? I'm damn proud to be an immigrant myself. My life has been easier since I grew up here, but I was born elsewhere and not once have they let me forget my past.   And I know that I will never forget what my parents have sacrificed for everything they have achieved.   So it pisses me off to see these motherfuckers walk into this country and expect things handed to them on a silver platter as soon as they get here. They think life is easy and that things should be catered to their whims and needs. You know what? Fuck you and what you want. Yes, it would be nice and easy if everything was in your language... but it's not .   You came here of your own free will; make the effort like so many who came here before you did.  Get over yourselves. Learn the damn language.

        Interesting...    Again, Mr. Den Beste has a beautiful post up on his site: this time he dicusses the " urlLink Mongol Horde " and brings to light the fact that the "Horde" was, in actuality, one of the most well-organized armed force in the world. Go read it  now , even if you have never had any passing interest in that facet of history.

        Whee!    So I finally saw Spiderman. All I have to say is, they cast the role of Peter Parker well; poor Tobey Maguire though, he really did look like a 15 year old -- I swear he had the role of the shaky-kinda-insecure-loser-that's-suddenly-kinda-cool  down . Like  urlLink Lane  said; 90% of that guy's acting is through his eyebrows; after seeing that movie, I don't doubt it. Overall, it was a good movie; parts of it were pure cheese and I giggled and laughed my ass off, other parts just kinda brought me down. Either way, it was still a cool movie overall.   :D    But enough of how cool it was, since you probably already knew that.   Anyway, before I go off to sleep, here's  urlLink an excellent post  by Mr. Den Beste concerning the 13 terrorists and what the situation concerning them is currently. I know I'm late on this, but oh well; still a damn good post and you should read it right now.   Nitey nite all.   :)

        Huh? Wha...?    Surfing the internet is usually amusing; I tend to find funny things to keep myself amused. However, sometimes I stumble on something that forces me to do a double-take, as with this article right here:   urlLink Families of 11 dead illegals to sue U.S.   Note the words " dead " and "  illegals  ". Explain to me why these people believe they should get compensation for their dead family members when they are   illegals  ?! Oh wait, the  attorneys  attempted to do so:    Attorneys for survivors of the deceased said that U.S. Border Patrol policies had shut down more populous portions of the Arizona border and forced illegal aliens to enter through more remote areas.    WHY ARE YOU CROSSING AT ALL?! AAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!!!  Whatever. Maybe I just don't get it, being that   MY FAMILY   came to this country   LEGALLY  .

        In case you missed it...     urlLink Matt Drudge  also posted his  urlLink own views  on the incident and explained what happened in better detail.   I hope he goes after O'Reilly with some sort of lawsuit, I really do. What O'Reilly said was intolerable.

        Sometimes you go too far...     If you are reading this and are in the NYC area, tune into WABC  770 AM   right this second  -- they're still discussing this.   So I'm on IRC when Nick says that  urlLink Matt Drudge  is the featured guest on  urlLink Lynn Samuel 's show -- and that  urlLink Bill O'Reilly  has decided to engage in some slandering against Drudge on an interview...  O'Reilly declared Drudge a "Crack Addict" and said that "Drudge should be killed".  Now, I never liked Bill O'Reilly to begin with: on his show, he's  always  interrupting his callers and guests. I used to watch the show because the topics are good, but I always walk away with the feeling that he is pompous, that he likes to hear his own voice and that he has an overinflated sense of self-worth.    But O'Reilly crossed over the line. He said these things with a dead serious voice and many people actually  believed  him -- IF that's not defamation of character or slander, I don't know what is.

        And I thought my eyes were cool...    I had  urlLink LASIK surgery  done in October of last year to correct my severely myopic eyes -- Let me tell you how awesome it is to not wear those goddamned glasses anymore...They were a pain in the ass, especially since my vision was horrendous; had my prescriptions been any worse, I could have been labeled as legally blind. How sad is that?? But anyway, my vision is damn good, 20/20 and I would say if you're considering the procedure, get it done. It's worth it...The insurance company says that procedure is purely cosmetic; but I beg to differ -- yet that's a rant for another day.   However,  this  procedure is pretty much a miracle: Patients are able to see after getting a  urlLink bionic retina  surgically implanted in their eyes. After years of almost complete blindness, these people are able to see again. I love technology...

        File under: STUPIDITY.    Not ten minutes ago, I was watching the Fox News Channel and they were talking to one of their reporters overseas and discussing the fate of the 13 terrorists and the 26 stupid motherfuckers who decided to join and commiserate with the terrorists in the Church of the Nativity -- From what was decided, the 26 would be sent back to the West Bank and  jailed  while the 13 would be sent to Cypress and held until they firgured out where they were going to send them.  Sounds reasonable, right? Being the fact that the 26 "protestors" did  more damage  to the Church than the  terrorists themselves  did...but that's a different story. Anyway, the reporter gave an update as to the status of these people. Check it out:    ¤¤¤   The 26 dumbasses [the ones who were supposed to be  jailed ] are now lounging about in a  beachfront hotel  where they are being treated as/being called  free men  and have been  resupplied with fresh guns .     ¤¤¤   Cyprus has  also  deigned to put up their charges, these  13 terrorists  in a  beachfront hotel  -- however there was no mention of it these 13 are being treated as or called free men.   All I have to say is.... WHAT ... THE ...  FUCK  ?!  Maybe it's just me, but these people are INSANE!! They shouldn't be treated like tourists or royalty --- they should be treated like the trash they are!! Beachfront hotels, my ass!   If this was  my decision  I'd find a nice  medieval castle  and throw them ALL in one of those  dungeons . Either that or separate them and throw them all into  solitary confinement chamber WITH sensory deprivation . And yes, I'd do the same thing to the 26 -- if they are stupid enough to throw their lot in with  terrorists  they should suffer the same fate  if not worse .

        Wonderful.    A while ago I remember WSJ had posted an article about the Antarctic ice shelf breaking off into smaller pieces; now  urlLink  CNN reports that another piece has broken free of the main mass and is floating about. This piece [called C-18] " measures roughly 47 miles by 4.6 miles (76 km by 7 km), or almost ten times the area of Manhattan " --  DAMN  is all I have to say. Hello, global warming!

        Humor and Fear...    For all my fellow coffee addicts:  urlLink Be amused .   :)    I'm not sure whether Richard Ankrom is brilliant or insane; those highway signs are pretty high and there are a damn lot of cars that pass underneath them going 65-70 mph, but he climbed up and  urlLink added his art to an existing highway sign . I have to laugh at the highway transit officials who didn't notice this change until someone in the local papers said something about it. Heh. Well, at least it's functional.    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   All I have to say is,   FEAR  .  urlLink Eight humans are getting implanted with ID chips :    The chip will be put in Isaacson's upper back, effectively invisible unless a hand-held scanner is waved over it. The scanner uses a radio frequency to energize the dormant chip, which then transmits a signal containing an identification number. Information about Isaacson is cross-referenced under that number in a central computer registry.   Wonderful. As the article says, this chip is being marketed to " to families of Alzheimer's patients--one of the fastest growing groups in American society--as well as others who have complicated medical histories "...But how long before the government decides that  everyone  needs this implant? This ties in with the  urlLink national ID card  that some people have been pushing for; now, here's my question. Don't we already have these? They're called  Driver's Licenses . Almost everyone has one and if you for some reason don't drive, you  urlLink can still get an ID card that looks like a driver's license  from your local DMV [of course that link works for NYers]. IF we have those two ID cards, why do we need a national one?

        GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!    I'm driving around in the rain, attacking a McDonald's for their Minute Maid soft frozen lemondade snack thingy, and listening to Savage Nation on 770 AM. More often than not, I find myself yelling back at the radio when he's on...This time it got started when a caller named "Kay" decided that the best thing to do is dump those 13 psychopathic shitheaded freaks that are holing up in the Church of the Nativity in "one of those landlocked third-world countries like Pah-rah-gah-way or You-rah-gah-way and just pay them something like $50,000 to keep them inprisoned. After all, we can afford such a cost." OOOoooh, I lost it. What the fuck!? So what if Paraguay is landlocked and not doing as financially well as the US!? TAKE A LOOK AT THE GODDAMNED MAP; it's  obvious  that Paraguay will never be a world superpower like the US, but it  is  a country in its own right. You honestly think Paraguayans don't have their own problems to deal with?! You honestly think that they are so bad off that they'll welcome these psychotic fucking freaks into their own borders with open fucking arms for a  mere  price of $50,000?!   WHAT ... THE ... FUCK ?!  Screw you Kay; how about we toss these fuckers into YOUR HOUSE and you can babysit these freaks? There, that will give you something to talk about. Shithead.  Another thing was a caller name "Grace" who had a problem with her 14-year-old daughter's friends in school; supposedly some of them were engaging in questionable activities such as self-mutilation, scarification and whatnot. Religion aside, the parents of the 14-year-olds who are engaging in self-mutilation and scarification should be notified of this behavior so that they can take their kids to a hospital and/or send them to a psychologist. Kids who do that are more often than not looking for attention; if their parents are oblivious to the situation but YOU notice it, tell their parents! Anyway, she was going off on how she was worried over her own daughter; she doubted that her daughter would "go down the same path as these girls" but she didn't know what to do. In her view, the parents weren't doing anything about their children and the school was "turning a blind eye" to what was going on. Savage chimed in with some sort of religious thing that Grace should teach her daughter that there are bad people in this world who would lead her astray. One comment caught my attention: "It all starts with the black nailpolish; then the black lipstick." He told this Grace that if her daughter ever came to the house with "bad clothing" that she should tell her daughter that it is bad clothing and then throw it in the fireplace.   OOOOooooh so scary; damn I'm stupid. It's all about that  black nailpolish  -- I'm EEEEEEeeeeeviL!   Anyway, according to his logic, I'm one of the "bad people that will lead you astray" because I favor black nailpolish, makeup, clothing and whatnot. Of course, I used to wear my gothic dresses and black  all the time  so OBVIOUSLY my soul is rotten and I am a part of the "Columbine for the Soul" demographic. Heh. I wonder what he would say if someone actually brought up goths? I'd hate to tune in and hear THAT commentary; I'd probably get into an accident yelling back at the radio in my car.  Remind me to break out my old Gothic dresses and clean them; I want to remember what being EEEEEEEEEeeeeeeviL was like.

        OOOooooh...This is gonna be DAMN cool...    Some guys are trying to make  urlLink videogames to help you relax . One of the games is called "Relax to Win":   "As you relax, your dragon will walk, then run and then fly," Dr McDarby said.   "If you can get it to fly, it means you have got into a nice relaxed state.      Ok, I want that game -- Even though I'm from the school of thought that finds Half-Life and Quake "relaxing"....This is right up my alley.  Bring it on.

        So Macromedia just went one step beyond...    Yeap; some guys who work for Macromedia [the people who created Dreamweaver, Flash and Fireworks -- whee!] have started their own blogs. Interesting...as Wired said, looks like  urlLink blogging has gone corproate . That's cool, for the most part; yet sadly [pathetically even] most of them are getting hit for "cracks" on Macromedia products. Heh! I'm not sure whether to laugh or send condolences at the absurdity of it all...Anyway, the only complaint I have with Macromedia is that Flash 5 wasn't included in my Dreamweaver 4/Fireworks 4 Macromedia Suite.   >:P   This would have helped me immensely, since my Web Development class incorporates all three [as well as Cold Fusion, but I'm not entirely thrilled with Cold Fusion...sorry guys] and I can't find Flash 5 ANYWHERE!!!! AAARGH!!!!  Anyway, enough bitching for now. I'm going to take a shower and relax after my time at the gym.

        "By and large, there's nothing like being Right."    I agree with this statement if you read it and take it at face value. Why  else  would we bother to argue with people if not to prove ourselves and our point of views "right" [or, if you prefer,  correct ]? But that is not what the quote means; it's from a WaPo article that discusses the political view called  the Right   urlLink  that is dominating the airwaves on AM radio stations . Or so they say. I happen to find this fascinating.  See, politics mildly scares me; there are so many different views and groups I easily get lost when they get discussed. So when people start criticizing these things about the Right, the Left, the Conservatives, the Liberals, the Independents and all these other neat little labels, I get slightly put off [since to me, those words have no political meaning]. But I'm willing to learn. The article in itself is especially interesting to me since my broken car radio is forcing me to sit up and take notice of AM Talk Radio; I can see how it is addicting, since I tend to find myself screaming back at the radio when they say something that I consider stupid. So I'm muddling through all these political groups and learning as I go and I have to say...it's fun!  Anyway, I think I should go to sleep now...  Enjoy the article.

        I love real-time help!    So  urlLink Lane  [with some help from  urlLink Jon ...Hi Jon!] has demystified my quest for what's going on with Bush and the Amendments. Since my car radio is on the fritz, I could only catch snippets of the conversation since it liked to turn itself off every few minutes [...then I got fed up and turned the damn thing off  myself ] and because of this, I thought the discussion was about the 22nd Amendment when in reality it was about the  2nd Amendment !  Thanks guys...I figured if anyone would know about this you guys would!   :D    I have a lot of  urlLink reading  to do now..    P.S. Lane -- What's with "Macaroni"?

        Testing, testing...    Something's up with Blogger; it keeps giving me weird error messages -- notably this one:   Error 502:File transfer server, user, and password must be specified to publish (server:page)    I have no idea what's up and it's starting to piss me off..I don't see any messages that they're having problems server-side and I've signed out and in again in case that was the problem...    AAAAAAAAAAAARGH.    This just rots.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤  6:43 PM    ...And what's up with people coming here for "Rachael Klein pictures" and "Neveron ICE Engines"? Weirdness...Well I'm sorry you guys didn't get what you wanted...And stay away from my Neveron Empires! LOL   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤  6:56 PM    Maybe someday soon Blogger will decide to work and update my page...Blaargh. It keeps messing with me, saying that it's updating and "Generating Pages" only to leave me with the same damn error message.  Error 502:File transfer server, user, and password must be specified to publish (server:page)  AAAAAARGH!   I just posted to their troubleshooting message boards to find that I'm not the only one with this problem. Heh. Seems as it's an old problem and yet no one has replied with an answer on how to fix it.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤

        Another day, another Bomb Scare...    Yeap, you read that right. Let me tell you, that was odd as hell; heading to Penn Station on the E, the train I was on was stopped at 50th Street [2 stops away from 34th/Penn] while the conductor and the station announcer conferred as to whether the train was going to be allowed to stop at 34th. After about 10 minutes, the train continued on and we were allowed to get of at 34th; it was weird. The first thing I noticed was the yellow caution tape blocking all the turnstiles -- we had to walk through the service gate single file. Once I arrived to the usual entrance, it was cordoned off and guarded by police officers who explained that Penn Station was closed and nothing was running due to a serious police investigation. Luckily we arrived at the tailend of the operation; after about 7 minutes of waiting around, they got the ok to let us all in at 2:18PM. I walked into Penn Station and the first thing that hit me was the emptiness and the quietness. All the shops were closed and gated, and there wasn't a soul in sight besides my fellow commuters behind me. Except, of course, for the myriad of police officers and their bomb dogs. I have to say those dogs are beautiful and [obviously] well trained; the first two that I saw were German Shepherds; but not of your usual coloration. One, a large male, was solid black with amber eyes and his smaller female companion was the same except for white markings on her paws [that made her look like she was wearing socks] and white on the very end of her tail. The others that I saw were normal German Shepherds -- still nice-looking dogs, but just not as impressive as the first two that I saw. All I have to say is, these guys have their shit together. Penn Station returned to its normal busy self by 2:30PM.   Weirdness. Like I overheard a fellow commuter say to his friend, "Just another day in NY."  Never a dull moment.  Heh.

        GRRRRRRRrrrrrr......    Wonderful. And now the comments aren't working; right when I wanted someone to clarify that whole 22nd Amendment thing. Blaargh.

        Broken Radios...    My car radio is broken; it likes to toy with me and work... some  of the time. Now it has decided that it will only allow me to listen to AM stations. Whee! Talk radio. When this happened before, I suddenly found myself addicted to  urlLink 1010 WINS  and  urlLink WCBS 880 ; now my latest addiction is  urlLink 770 WABC  which is home to many interesting people whom you might be familiar with: Matt Drudge [yes,   that    urlLink Matt Drudge !], Sean Hannity [yes,   that    urlLink Sean Hannity !], Richard Bey [anyone else remember the  urlLink Richard Bey Show ? heh!  urlLink Jerry ,  bow down  to the man who paved the way for you and allowed your show to become popular.]  urlLink Lynn Samuels ,  Mike Savage and Paul Harvey [yay!]. Anyway,  I'm driving along listening to Mr. Hannity's show [he talks about seemingly random things that happen -- however the man scares me half the time...he is so long-winded, I swear he doesn't even pause long enough to  breathe ! I  wish  I was able to do that...Lucky, lucky...] and the small newsbreaks are hilarious [yay for the Hillbilly News!] and today he had a wide variety of topics to discuss. Prevalent was the mailbox pipe-bomber incident; he was reading the kid's bio and for some reason, it included the fact that the kid loved Nirvana and Kurt Cobain and also had his own  urlLink punk-rock band . Interesting; the feeling I got from this was as if the people who wrote up this psychopath's bio were saying, "Hey, watch out! If your kids like this kind of music, they might be crazy too!" Heh. Another part of the news focused on the fact that "Kids who get body piercings are more apt to engage in deviant behavior". Ooooh, wow. Piercings have taken over the blame for tattoos; I love this country. Yet he interrupted his own program with the newsflash of yet another suicide bomber in Israel; this time it was happening at the exact same time as Ariel and the Prez were in discussions. I hate to say it, but was anyone truly surprised? I know I wasn't; it's sad to think that these fuckers are still running around blowing themselves up and kililng innocent people.I don't remember if Hannity made the point [or one of his callers did] that this also happened after Arafat was released from his "imprisonment".  I think it's just too bad these fuckers didn't just strap on explosives and blow themselves up in their own backyards. It would give them satisfaction and rid their stupidity from the gene pool.   Something else caught my attention, but I don't think it was brought up on Hannity's show; I believe it was on Savage's show [but I could be wrong] that brought up the topic that Bush had some sort of stance that the  urlLink 22nd Amendment  should be done away with?  Anyone out there in the Blogosphere care to explain that one to me? I unfortunately only caught a snippet since the radio decided to screw with me and started turning itself off and I could only get every other word...  Thanks.

        WSJ's BotW email is finally back...    ...But there really wasn't anything that I really liked.   I don't know, nothing really drew me...So I'll just leave you with some  old ,  odd  things that I happen to find amusing [then again, this could just be the sleep-deprivation talking so I really wouldn't know].  I started out having a bad day today but it progressively got better; things are looking up!   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   First up is  urlLink And they danced...  I have no idea how to explain this other than it's  really  strange; something about the TECHNO! part of it though makes this worth it...Yeah, it's old, but I still like it.  Second is Rachael Klein of the  Daily Californian  -- She happens to write the sex column and I happen to  love  her blatant and blunt way of telling things like it is. This is her  urlLink latest article ...If for some reason the link doesn't work let me know.  Third is something that  urlLink Lane  found; it's called " urlLink exploding dog ", a website where "Sam" has some [seemingly] simplistic drawings of different random phrases that get sent to him. [I say seemingly, because they look like something created in Flash or Fireworks, and I'm  still  learning how to maneuver in those progs so I know how difficult it is to get what you want...]  Fourth is Rolling Stones' two articles listing the " urlLink 50 Coolest Records " and conversely, its bi-polar opposite, the " urlLink 50 Uncoolest Records " -- I'm just neither since Rolling Stone and I seem to have a difference of opinion on what's cool...   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   My "Cool" stuff:  Massive Attack // Protection [I find it strange that the people at Rolling Stone know who they are...] Beck // Odelay [Personally, I liek Mellow Gold  much better  Michael Jackson // Off the Wall [On a RECORD!!! You know, those large weird circular black things with grooves on them? Heh, how much more old-skool can ya get?]  The Chemical Brothers // Dig Your Own Hole [It's the Chem. Bros...'Nuff Said.]   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   My "Uncool" stuff:  Weezer // Weezer [Can you say: geek rock? Yeah, this was the better album...Sadly.]  Meat Loaf // Bat Out of Hell [OK I take offense that this is on the "uncool" list...]  Pet Shop Boys // Actually [For odd some reason, I  love  the Pet Shop Boys...But I happen to like "Behavior." and "Very." much better.]    ¤¤¤  ¤¤¤   Lastly I have the  urlLink Guy's Guide to Geek Girls...Illustrated!  'Nuff said. However I don't remember where I got this link from, so...  However...It's time for sleepy.

        Outside is so beautiful...    And I have inherited a new camera [Nikon N90] with two extra lenses [a beautiful telephoto and a wide angle lens]. I'm going to spend the rest of my day outside shooting photographs since it looks like WSJ is slacking off, most of my friends are offline or away from the computer, and the last person I wanted to talk to is pissed off in general and doesn't want to be bothered right now.   Yay for my car and this N90. Time to rock.

        Awwww,  so  glad to see you care...    So, I'm a part of this BlogSnob thing; it sounded amusing so I signed up. It's free, it's wonderful, random people stop by to visit and say hello [hello  urlLink Katrina !] and some even stay awhile. However, what happens when people get rejected? Some turn to their thesaurus for comfort:    Look at who they accepted. They are pedantic, arid, dry, dull, dunces, chuckleheads, dopey, dumbheads, noodles, schnooks, bleary eyed, blockheaded, dense, doltish, dull, dumb, numbskulls, pinheads, thick, retarded, simple, asinine, fatuous, foolish, silly, oafish, sluggish, half-assed, crass, backwards, idiotic, nitwits, witless, vacuous, irrational, ignorant, scatterbrained, dippy, irrational, wacked-out, absurd, preposterous, and sappy.    Why doesn't anyone like me?    Yes, each word was linked to a fellow BlogSnob...I'm filed under "blockheaded". Awww, I feel the love!  ...Actually, I'm miffed.  You read my blog and walked away angry and upset because I got accepted into a webring and you didn't [and  that, in itself  is quite amusing]...and the only word you could come up with was "blockheaded"??  Why couldn't I have been "irrational", "absurd" or even "wacked-out"? I mean, come on, you list "irraional"  twice ...Damn, a quick stop at  urlLink Thesaurus.com  with the word "blockhead" left me with two main categories ("Fool" and "Imbecile") that led to more interesting choices. I could have been any of the following: "simpleton", "witling", "dizzard", "ninny", "nincompoop", "zany" [although I rather like the word zany], "babbler" -- and that's just under the "Fool" category. Next time put some effort into it!  Ok I'm done now. Heh.    Oh, and...By the way.... Thanks for all the hits!      >:)

        Now comes the weeks-long beautiful music of her tortured screams....    Heh. So I'm bored, annoyed at the fact that I wasn't able to buy tickets for Spiderman and I want to get out of this damn house. I'm to the point that I'm debating going to the theater anyway and watching any old stupid movie since the ones I wanted to see aren't cooperating...  The last showing of Ice Age was 4:45 PM.  Damn, and I wanted to laugh... Deuces Wild, a movie about a 1950s-era street gang [damn cool in  my  opinion] looks good, but I'm wary of those 4 1/2 stars when everyone else is saying it was horrendous... Spiderman. It's 9:12 PM by my clock; it's sold out by now. Life...OR Something Like It -- the only redeeming value that this sappy ass looking movie has is that Angelina Jolie stars in it. [She's my favorite actress...]  Whatever. Blaargh. Screw this. I'm probably just going to wind up in front of this damn computer...like always...listening to music [Photek: Modus Operandi's playing right now] and surfing the net. My life is boring even me...  I'll scream later. For now, I'll just revel in my insanity.  Oh, here' s something I found in my travels...Sorry; I'm usually better than this, but I forgot where I found this: my stomach is bothering me right now so I'm not feeling up to par.

        Damn You Brøderbund...    When I was younger, we had very few educational-yet-fun computer programs in school; "The Oregon Trail" was one of them, but the other...  The other was so cool I used to try to figure out different ways to race down to the complab and grab it off the shelf before anyone else did:     "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"    Damn, I loved playing every minute of that damn game; I remember telling my dad about the game and getting it for my birthday. I was the happiest girl ever! Carmen Sandiego kicked ass and looked good doing it too; she always wore a  red  trenchcoat and a  red  fedora that covered her eyes but allowed that gleeful smirk to show. She stole the coolest things and knew she was just  that damn good ; good enough that she decided to entertain herself by dropping hints and clues as to where she was going next in the world, deriving her fun from knowing that she was  always  just one step ahead of the cops. She had a cat too, but even in the face of all this cool stuff was something else that endeared her to me...  She had  black  hair, like me.   You see, not that many games had black-haired chicks in them, let alone as the main character. I liked Carmen; I liked the fact that even though she was supposedly "the bad guy" and stole all these seemingly random things,  she  was the  leader  of her crew and was smart enough to leave clues and play games to keep herself entertained. I never did wind up catching her; call me crazy, but I had way too much respect for a fellow black-haired chick...Even though she was only digital.   Carmen was so cool, she had her own live game show [yes, I was a geek and watched it! YAY Rockapella! LMAO...] and even starred in her own cartoon...But now, a new "improved" Carmen is endearing herself to a new generation of educational-computer-gaming kids and she's  different ...  She  now  has  brownish-blonde  hair.  Maybe I'm just a sentimental dumbass, but I don't know if I'd get into the game  now  if I was a kid...I mean it was one hell of a fun game, but Carmen's black hair was the coolest thing for me.   Whatever. I think it's time for bed anyway...  I hate you Brøderbund executives.

See if you can do better:  urlLink Females or Shemales ?  I don't know what else to say...   GO WORSHIP THE GROUND  Sylvia  WALKS ON!!! RIGHT THIS SECOND!!!!

         HELL YEAH!!!     AS cool as some of them are...Screw all these vampire movies; I happen to love werewolves. Give me the ability to shift into Crinos form any day over that whole "I'm-5-centruies-old-and-even-though-I'm-sexy-I-can't-screw-and-all-I-can-do-is-suck-your-blood-like-an-overgrown-tick" thing. Yeah. Anyway, what brings this on is my friend Paul [no, not   The Paul  , but a kick ass Paul nonetheless!] sent me this link about a new werewolf movie:  urlLink Dog Soldiers .   Looks hella cool, but...I have two problems: 1.) It's not coming to the US anytime soon 2.) I want to see a werewolf movie that ties in more closely with the werewolves of W:tA.   I happen to  like  how  urlLink  White Wolf protrays werewolves in its gaming system [Werewolf: the Apocalypse urlLink  ]; intelligent creatures that revel in their duality and don't become stupid slaves to killing every full moon.  Maybe someday soon some movie producers who play W:tA will get up off their asses and do a werewolf movie the way it should be done.... ...Or maybe I should stop dreaming for them to get a clue and do it myself.  Heh.

         Names...    David Tepper of Wake Me Up On Judgement Day urlLink   found this  urlLink website  that supposedly gives you your personality by "analyzing" your name. HE wasn't impressed at all; I just find it humerous! Here's my results...No, it's not my real name, but most of the answers overlap:   Raven :    ¤  You make impersonal decisions quickly, but not so with personal concerns.   ¤  You like to think things over carefully, but tend to be indecisive.   ¤  You have much enthusiasm with a driving attitude toward achievement in life.   ¤  You can easily detach from people and situations.   ¤  You enjoy unconventional friends.   ¤  You can be quite inventive and quite curious.   ¤  You can handle details well.   ¤  You have a methodical mind.    Wolf :   ¤  Take advantage of all opportunities.  ¤  You must develop your creativity and talents.  ¤  You are determined to prove yourself to others.  ¤  You have a great deal of loyalty to those you love.  ¤  You have much inner strength.  ¤  You have a diplomatic flair to your nature.  ¤  Equality and fairness are important to you.  ¤  You are naturally friendly.  ¤  You can be the life of the party.   Heh. Like I said, some of the answers overlap; a few of them I even like! One answer that I got for my real name was this:  "You enjoy being stroked verbally and physically."  LOL! I love that...  ...And, no, I'm not going to tell you if that's true or not.     >:)

         Well, if you  insist ...    Fed up with your normal Walk-a-Thons and Bike-a-Thons for a good cause? Then this might just be the  urlLink fundraiser  for you...Now, here's my question:  how do they know you're...uh...participating? Honor system, Shmonor system; that's still kinda scary, don't you think? Weirdness...but hey, since they're twisting arms for membership, maybe you all should join in...   >:)   Oh yeah, did you happen to realize that this is the FOURTH ANNUAL event?!  Hah!    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    On a completely   DIFFERENT NOTE  , go to a Baskin Robbins near you for a  urlLink free scoop of ice cream!   Heh, I should charge for these plugs... ;)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    UPDATE:    So I went to my local Baskin Robbins to revel in the free ice cream...only to realize that i was a half-hour late on the promotional. HEH! Well, I must have looked pitiful since the guys gave it to me anyway; that and I was the  only one  who was brave enough to try the ice cream named "Tax Crunch". Don't let the "Tax" in the name fool you; it's  damn good !  Yummy chocolate goodness.   Well, until next year...And hopefully I'll remember to check the times on these promotionals...LOL!   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤

        Kyle, I'm starting to worry about you...    Pretty soon you're gonna end up like me, addicted to taking internet tests. Heh! So, here are my results for the Presidential Hopeful test thing [courtesy of  urlLink Kyle Still ]  I'm not sure if I should be proud or scared shitless.    urlLink        urlLink Which Presidential Hopeful Are You?     This quiz was made by  urlLink Ben.        urlLink        urlLink Which Presidential Hopeful Are You?     This quiz was made by  urlLink Ben.     OK, personally I find this shit  hilarious ! I mean, I'm so un-political it's disgusting...Again, I'm not sure whether I should be proud over these results or scared shitless! Heh.  All I have to say is....HAH! That is one wicked hella funny picture of McCain; poor guy, there's thousands upon thousands of pictures of him on the WWW, but when he's been immotalized into an internet test  that's  the one they picked...HAH! The amusement  abounds !

        Talking about weirdness...    Here's something I'll bet you'd never think of in your lifetime: Eminem (that weird rapper guy who's got all sorts of psychological issues -- don't know about him? Ask a random kid on the street.) met Donny Osmond (that weird guy who just has issues -- don't know about him? Ask your mom.) and  urlLink  named him as one of his musical influences. Of course, this is   really old news...as in: a little over a year old (yay for archives!)   but I still thought it was damn strange and worthy of linkage....   urlLink Weirdness  courtesy of  urlLink Can't Get Worse .

        Weirdness...    Can someone please explain to me what the mainstream bloggers' obsession with "Christian blogging" is all about? I don't get it. Oooh, they're  Christian  and they  blog . Wow! Whoda Thunkit?! Fanfuckingtastic.  So what? Have to be careful with this one guys...You might start something. Soon the web will be filled with "Wiccan bloggers" and "Atheist bloggers" and "Jewish bloggers" and "Muslim bloggers" and "Agnostic bloggers" and "Pagan bloggers" and "Buddhist bloggers" and "Satanist bloggers" and "Hindu bloggers" and "Jedi bloggers"...  What?? You thought Jedis existed only in the movies?! Silly silly, England's got a fair share of Jedis living within its borders...But that's  urlLink old news .      >:)     Next thing you know there's gonna be a riot over Spanish chicks who blog.... Oooh, maybe I can cash in on that one.  Heh.

        The Joys of Complab Comps and C++    I hate the computers we get for class; nothing ever works properly in this school. This is pathetic and yet amusing at the same time...Every two minutes the computer  insists  on informing me that the lab printer has run out of paper. This is all well and good, but  I just don't give a damn  AND the printer is stocked with enough paper in the damn tray...I know. I checked. The damn popup is starting to get really goddamned annoying. ARRGH. Heh. Updating the blog during C++, whee! Anyway...  Would someone out there who knows C++ mind telling me what's wrong with this code? My professor wrote it on the board  as is ; I keep having compiling problems with it, and he refuses to explain the code further. He says it should compile fine but I can't get the damn thing to work. I feel like this code is  missing some fundamental pieces , but I can't figure it out -- and the fact that he says it should work fine  the way it is now  isn't helping.  #include   #include    main() { 	int i=0, n; 	char inbuf [1000]; 	char * names [100];  	cout  	cin.getline (inbuf,1000);  		while (inbuf [0] != '\0')  		{ 			intlen = strlen(inbuf); 			names[i]=newchar(len+1); 			strcpy(names[i], inbuf); 			i++; 			cout  			cin.getline (inbuf,1000); 		} }  Anyone? Anyone???  I think I'm gonna start yelling at this man in a few minutes; this is getting ridiculous. Blaargh.

        Hrrrm...    I talk to my friends all the time about random shit; this time it was about my surgery. I was kinda harping over this kid in my school who   constantly   asks me the same questions  every damned day , concerned over my vision: "How are your eyes doing? Can you still see? Are they still itchy and dry?"  I'm sure he means well, but most of the time I just want to grab him by the neck, shake him, strangle him and say, "I'M FUCKING FINE!! SHUT UP!!" Ah well. There are mornings when I wake up searching for my glasses; usually those are the mornings after I have a particularly realistic dream about the past and in those few fuzzy moments between true wakefulness and sleep, I somehow forget that the surgery ever took place.   It's odd really. If you told me a few years ago that I would undergo LASIK surgery and run around without glasses, I would have laughed in your face and called you one  stupid  motherfucker who should lay off the crack for a while. (Dumbass.) Heh! My eyes were [and  still are ] my most important obsession. After all, it took me 16 years to swallow the fear of putting eyedrops in my eyes and 2 more years after that to learn to do it myself with out  having my family members pinning me and forcing the drops in my eyes. I remember the day my ophthalmologist suggested contact lenses for me; he tried putting in the trial versions into my eyes and my scream of pure terror was heard two offices over. I honestly don't know what possessed me and give me the courage to undergo the surgery but I  do  know what propelled me to consider it. Trust me, after 13 years of suffering through the different stages of lenses [the thick coke-bottle  true glass  lenses from when I  first  got them to my last pair that were made of the lightweight teflon-type stuff that were  still  pretty damn thick] and being so damn myopic that your face  literally  had to be about 5 inches away from mine before it would be in focus...Being able to see clearly  without  glasses is pretty fucking awesome. And while this may sound ridiculous, I'm saving a hell of a lot of money in the long run by having undergone the surgery; no more buying $300 glasses every damn year [or twice/thrice a year, depending on how bad the frames were damaged since I had a habit of breaking frames randomly]. Yet, there are days where I kinda miss those damn frames on my face, if only for the extra respect they generated. I'm starting to realize that people tended to take me more seriously and actually  listened  to what I had to say when I had glasses. Sucks, but that was quite possibly the  one  perk of wearing them; you reap the benefits of the preconceived notion that "only supremely intelligent people wear glasses". I know I am an intelligent person, yet I know that I'm not going to be winning any Pulitzers or Nobel Peace Prizes or discovering the secrets of the universe. But, I can hold a decent conversation, puzzle through difficult ideas and learn new things. So what if I don't have my glasses anymore? Am I not that believable, respectable without them? Did my I.Q. suddenly take a nosedive when the LASIK laser first cut that flap of cornea and started making corrections on my eyeball? I don't think so, yet there are times where I'm sorely tempted to take my old frames and replace my old prescription lenses with plain glass ones just to reap the benefits of the geeky stereotype. Heh. Let me join the ranks of the EmoCore kids who do the same damn thing. What was that old saying? "95% of Emo Kids DON'T Need Their Glasses!" If I remember correctly, that's even the title of a song. Hah!   Ah well. I think I might do it anyway just for those days where I wake up and feel the need to feel the weight of frames on my nose. After all, I spent a damn pretty penny on my last pair of frames and only wore them for about 4 months...Might as well get SOME use out of them.  Damn nostalgia. Heh.   Never in a million years did I think I'd say that...      Weird.       Note: This was posted earlier but somehow it got messed up. Luckily I had a backup copy of what I had written.

        ...And now, something completely different.    YAY!    urlLink Nick  finally updated his blog.   :D   Also,  urlLink WishWatch  is BACK with a vengeance! Whee!  urlLink Clay  has comments on his blog now...Excellent! [And yes, more Drunk Clay pictures are needed!]    ;)    urlLink Orchid  has some funny links up... Talking about funny shit,  urlLink Lane 's got pictures of the new world leader... And of course,  urlLink Jim  always puts a smile on my face.   :)   You should all go visit  urlLink The Society  right this second. As far as I know,  urlLink Leonard  is the only blogger out there who discusses anarchy, so go read his thoughts on it. I  still  have  no idea  how  urlLink The Shmuck  and  urlLink Alan  found me, but either way, their respective blogs are good; the former deals with politics and the latter deals with tech stuff. I happen to like  urlLink Sarge 's pictures. [I feel weird using his real name so Sarge he stays.]   :)    urlLink Katrina warns  about WinAmp3. Tanks! Good luck  urlLink Blue Hill !   WAAH!  urlLink S.G.  has gone over to the Dark Side. :( Those on short breaks are missed:  urlLink Doc ,  urlLink Kyle ,  urlLink Zilber  and  urlLink Mindles .  Yet all of their reasons are understandable.

         urlLink Friday Five...yeap, already, again.      When was the last time you...    1. ...sent a handwritten letter?  Wow. It's been a looong ass time, I know  that  for sure; hrrrrm, 4 years? Something like that? It's definately been a while.    2. ...baked something from scratch or made something by hand?  I'm still knitting. I have no fucking clue what I'm making, but I'm knitting. It's more for theraputic value I guess.   3. ...camped in a tent?  Never. Camping in a tent normally means you're outside in the wilderness and I'm allergic to the wilderness. Sucks, because I really want to do that kind of stuff but my fucking sinuses, skin, lungs and other such shit won't allow me to do so. Grrrr.    4. ...volunteered your time to church, school, or community?  Well, I used to be the cantor in church about 4 years ago. Recently haven't done much though. Oh well.    5. ...helped a stranger?  I don't remember. Couple of days ago maybe? Gave directions. *shrug* Nothing big.

        Time off...    So far, my vacation has been fun. Saw Lilo & Stitch and alternately laughed and cried my way through through that movie. I don't normally cry at movies but at some parts it just hit a little too close to home. My rating? Damn good! Same rating for Windtalkers [if you can get over the whole MoviePhysics/Reality thing where one bullet kills 6 people and one side can't hit for shit unless it's an important character...You know, the  usual ...However I will say they broke the rules a few times; you  actually see  Nicolas Cage's character  reloading !!   Whoda thunk it?! Breakthrough directing, lemme tell ya. Heh.]  Still freaking out a bit because they only posted one grade so far; I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack soon if they don't post anything...BLAARGH!! But anyway, this whole "I don't have to commute! WHEE!" thing is getting out of hand. I can get used to this, heh!   Hrrrm...Gym is going great; got re-evaluated and am still waiting on the printout of my results; this will come on thursday and then I can update my progress chart. Excellence. What else? Ah yes, got a new radio for my car, complete with CD player so I've been driving around aimlessly just to listen to it. Still planning on a day to hit the beach  during the daytime      in order to work on tanning my skin. I'm disgustingly pale and it sickens me that Nick has surpassed me  yet again , another year in a row. I have to fix that. Somehow I'm gonna catch up. I don't know how, but I will.   ; )   Got a few more pictures, however these damn uncooperative people decided to mess up my shots by going to the beach when I wanted to take pictures. Bastards!  Grrr, that makes me angry. Oh well, it's summertime, I should have thought about that...annoyance...but still...just...GRRRRR!   Heh.  I think that's about it...I'll try to get a few fun links in here the rest of the day...   JOY!

        The  urlLink Friday Five :     1. Do you live in a house, an apartment or a condo?  A house in NY. Whee.   2. Do you rent or own?  Neither and it sucks for the reasons following in the next question.   3. Does anyone else live with you?  Yes, since I had to move back home: parents and mom's cute but annoying yappy dog. However,  my  dog also lives here and keeps me company throughout the insanity and the canary also brightens up my day sometimes.   4. How many times have you moved in your life?  About seven times; not too many.   5. What are your plans for this weekend?  Plans? What are these plans you speak of? Heh. Honestly, I have no clue; it's all about spontaneity, baybee! Then again, Minority Report opens today and I'd like to see that sometime this weekend...   There. Not the best of Friday Fives, and yet I completed it anyway...Yeah, I'm addicted. Hrrrm, maybe I should start answering these on the " urlLink My Addictions " page...   :)

        Friday excellence...    Yesterday was a beautiful day, I'm sure...The sun was streaming in my windows and all was well, considering that my cable modem decided to go on strike at around 2:30 pm and refused to work for a long time. Enough for me to call up the company and ask if there was a problem in the service area; nope, no widespread problems, just me. Heh! They said they'd send someone over in the morning to take a look at it so I busied myself with laundry, cleaning and straightening up in preparation for some stranger just walking into my house. Joy.  So it wasn't exactly the most incredible of days; it got to the point where I started even cleaning out my harddrive. Paul called me up at around 10 to see if I wanted to hang out and being that I haven't seen him in a long ass time I said, "Sure!"   It's all about Beef Bishop Way.   >:)    All in all it was a good day.   Now I'm late on most of this stuff, but who cares? It's fun: ~~ For my friends who play BattleTech -- Watch out! Now there really is a  urlLink ForestryMech ...HAH! ~~  urlLink Nick Denton  found a cool link to an article that goes superbly in depth about this whole "blogging phenomenon" by  urlLink Rick Bruner .  ~~ Eric Raymond of  urlLink Armed and Dangerous  decides to provide an objective male view on  urlLink porn ...[forgot how I found that link, I apologize] ~~ And I happen to like this blog now:  urlLink Not the Droids You're Looking For ...Somehow, I got a referral from them and I have no idea how that was possible because I sure as hell can't find where they linked me. Ah well, random referrals aren't uncommon for me and I'm just happy that I found this person's blog.   :D   ~~ Is it just me or do the  urlLink people at NPR  have something stuck up their asses? ~~ And  urlLink some things are better left unquestioned . Come on now, who really cares what's in there that makes you feel good? Just enjoy yourself and don't question it. ~~  urlLink New money ? Good stuff! Just don't make it pink or anything... ~~  urlLink Another one bites the dust . ~~  urlLink EPA says toxic sludge is good for fish  -- That just says it all, don'tcha think?  ~~ I heard  urlLink about this  as it was being discussed on  urlLink The Buzz ...   Like I said, all in all it was a good day. Let's see what later today brings...

        Tuesday Morning...     Please excuse me while I channel someone...       Do or do not. There is no try.       Well at least it promises to be a beautiful day today; the morning sun is shining spectacularly and glittering on the water, the light already warm on my skin. Just  perfect  for my Systems Analysis final...Joy. But at least this final is the last one until....F R E E D O M ! ! !   By 1pm today I will be free of this semester and let me tell you, I can't fucking wait that long. Vacation, here I come! *dances around* Excellence. This final is worrying me a bit, but I'm going to do my best. Later on today I have a re-evaluation at my gym to see where I'm at in my progress; something else I can't wait to see the results of...  Joy.    :D

        It's a Monday, but who cares?    Well, besides  urlLink Paul , who's not ready for it. [He also has a neatly-linked write-up of the event. :) ]  Ken delivers with humor his  urlLink own account of the party  and joy! He still has his thesaurus handy! Doc Weevil has  urlLink answered my plea  for  urlLink party pictures  and Jim [like Leonard] was apprehensive about the people who were going to the party but it seems like he walked away with a  urlLink good opinion  of us... urlLink Elizabeth  also had a good time and Jessica was among those who stayed until closing time [although, *sniffle* she and the others didn't care about the outcome of Paraguay-Germany...Ah well, I'm the only one really with some sort of stake in it and I didn't even really care, lol!] Missed  urlLink Caryn  but she reports that she had fun as well and has some amusing advice to female bloggers. [Just as long as you remember that some of the people there will be spoken for...]  It's cool to see so many different reactions, especially from the "first-timers" -- All this apprehension!  We really  aren't  some weird blogger cult [unless you count Queen Galt's court...J/K!!] nor are we computer-crazed blog-addicted sociopaths so it's all good. :)   On another note,  urlLink Mike  has a beautiful post about his father and cars. I thought he was cool before, but damn...he just gained some more points for that. Awesome post.  Also, Nick Denton is  urlLink working on a project  called the  urlLink Blogallery  and is currently accepting pictures according to a criteria that he as posted. So far the collection is pretty cool...  Well, I aced my first final -- Now it's time for lunch and preparation for my next final...Humanities. Joy.    Let's see how this plays out.

        Success!      urlLink        So, Blogapalooza was a success! Whee! Had a ton of fun, although it was damn expensive: $9 for a tiny glass of Midori Sour.   :P   The weirdest thing was the moss garden; I kid yout not! Real moss too; I made the mistake of putting my palm on it...Ick! At least my allergies were nice to me and they didn't flare up. Lots of little rooms to sit and chat in which was pretty cool, but not the best when you want to keep track of everyone and try to meet everyone...Ah well. I know I'm gonna forget a lot of the new people I met so please forgive me...     :(    It was kinda strange being introduced to everyone as " The  sexiest female blogger in the Blogosphere!!!!" all the time, but I had to laugh! Hella funny stuff...  Nick and I came late to the party but it's all good; there were a lot of friendly faces that returned from last time:  urlLink Sasha  who wore this awesome blue silk kimono [?] and an InstaPundit t-shirt,  urlLink Ken  who shared a really funny story with me, urlLink  Paul  who promises that my shirt will be coming soon [   :D   ],  urlLink Doc , who as usual was snapping candid shots, and  urlLink Clay  with his pictures of barmaids and his pictures with Ann Coulter [sorry man, but she really does remind me of a humanoid giraffe!!] Whee! [And  of course   urlLink Jane  was there silly...]   Spent a good portion of the night talking to  urlLink Liz  about her awesome ink [better known for her work on the  urlLink NYC Bloggers Subway Map  or as  urlLink Crafty Bitch ] and  urlLink Leonard  about being an outspoken introvert. [It sounds weird, but trust me, it's possible.] He says nice things about us NYC bloggers in  urlLink his post  [considering he was skeptical about bloggers being normal poeple, :P ] AND he has pictures! LOL, the joys of having a digicam that works. Lucky bastard! I took the picture of him talking; he also was kinda enough to say nice things about me in his blog too, lol!...I also met the woman behind  urlLink Capital Influx , Elizabeth Spiers. She hopes that we all can try to get together monthly...It's a great idea, but it's hard getting everyone together being that we all have different schedules and whatnot. All I have to say is that I'm [impatiently] waiting for  urlLink Doc Weevil 's pix to be posted: he took a ton that were more candid shots. I know there's one that Doc took when I was talking to Clay about Ann Coulter and her neck -- I was gesturing while explaining that the neckline on the shirt Ann was wearing wasn't exactly flattering to her  right  when he took the picture so I'm either going to come out looking like I'm strangling myself or pulling down my own shirt. HAH! The amusement abounds.   After the bar we went to a pizza place right around the corner; luckily they were nice enough to accommodate 15 people with short notice. The name of the place was Big Nick's, so I had to take a picture of Nick with the menu...Heeheehee...Well, at least  I  found it amusing.   : )    My table consisted of Nick, Sasha, Doc, Leonard, and Allan [of  urlLink Rough Days for a Gentil Knight ]. Sasha suggessted getting a salami pizza; after a few minutes of confusion, we all agreed to try this being that she assured us that it was damn good...It may sound strange, but lemme tell you...DAMN!  Hella good pizza! While eating, the conversation covered a myriad of things and towards the end Doc told us some funny stories. Right as we were finishing, this weird old [I hope, drunken by the way he was acting] smelly guy with a harsh Russian [to my ears] accent decided to take an interest in my table since apparently, we were sitting at "his table". He wouldn't go away! He started bothering us about some book that he was writing and then decided to single out Ken for his strange ravings and rantings: "You are the cause of the downfall of the stock market!", "I want to have your children!", "You are the downfall of the economy!"  Weird things were spewing from this strange man's mouth. If only he knew that he would be infamous on the internet within a day...And had he gone further into his drunken rantings, there would have been 15 people pummeling him. Heh. I also met Jessica, the mind behind  urlLink Chloë and Pete . She's a really nice person although I wish I was able to talk to her more; I met her towards the end when we were all at the pizza place.  All in all a good night; had fun with the old friends, made some new ones and all is well...I hope to see them all next time too!     :D       ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~      UPDATE [10:57 PM]:     YAY! Pictures!!!   urlLink Click here to see them  OR click on the Blogparty Sticker...It's all good!     :)      ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~

        Wow.    Looks like Bigwig, Kehaar [!!!! :D !!!!] and Woundwort have put aside their differences and  urlLink created their own blog ...Took me damn long enough to find them too...Heh. Although I'd be more impressed if he said Thlayli...    ; )    Excellent. I found a place that has all of the  urlLink Bud Light commercials ...BOTH the "Real American Heroes" AND the new one, "Real Men of Genius" !!!! :D   And while this is old...It's just  urlLink so  cute  !  >:)   That's it for now...

        Grrr.    So I wrote this nice post inspired by my joy at dancing to Santana's "Black Magic Woman" but when I clicked "Post & Publish" ...my wonderful post was lost to digital oblivion.  Grr!  I   hate it   when that happens! Oh well, not really much I can do about it. Blaargh.    :(    I heard the resounding collective sigh of relief emitted from all around the blogosphere and that's how I knew that  urlLink Asparagirl  has returned to blogging. Welcome back Asp!   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~     ~~~ ~~~ ~~~    urlLink Annessa ! Sorry it took so long, but I just wanted to say thanks for permalinking me!  I also want to say thanks to  urlLink Kyle Still  for adding me to  his  permalink section and also say hello and thanks to   urlLink Alan Daniels  for the same thing. While I've been reading Kyle for some time now, I'm not exactly sure who Alan is [sorry Alan!] but I like his site anyway so go check him out.  Hello to  urlLink Sashinka  [hella cool name!] and thank you very much for your nice words of praise! Heya  urlLink Jessica ! You've got the backing of a lot of the cooler, heavy-hitting bloggers out there so you're definately off to a good start! Don't worry, if you do make it to the party, just listen for the loudmouth attached to the short female. That'd be me...    ; )    Bonjour Emmanuelle! I have to agree with you, the poll did go on  urlLink a little too long ; either way it was fun!  Sorry to dissapoint you Rabbit, but I guess you're right; I happen to  love  my  urlLink multiple exclamation points , and I guess others do too...  urlLink HI RYAN ! [Say hi to your friend Raj too...]  :)   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~     ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Joy! I had one hell of a workout today at the gym doing something called "pyramiding". What it boils down to is a strength/endurance test to make sure the muscles you're exercising are where they are supposed to be. Sometimes you surprise yourself and realize that the weight you can bear is more than what you were previously excercising with; this is good and the proper adjustments can be made to the workouts. You don't  think  you're doing that much but afterwards, you do feel a little achy being the fact that you just finished testing out your musculature.  Now, while I normally   despise   country music, a country singer has endeared himself to me: Toby Keith. I heard about him during my workout [they have the TV on for the people on the bikes and the treadmills] -- He was scheduled to sing at some big event [only heard parts of it] but at the last minute they canned him because of "controversial lyrics" contained in his new single "The Angry American". They posted the lyrics on the screen and it was just damn good patriotic stuff [in MY eyes at least].  IF I can find the song and/or the lyrics I'll post them up here. Screw the event planners. It was good stuff.  As for other Blogstuff?  urlLink Mike 's on a posting roll and [YAY!] his link is working again!  Found  urlLink this amusement  via  urlLink The Society  [and later found  urlLink another link to it  by the VodkaPundit].   urlLink Lane explains  the differences between Madonna and Kelly Osbourne [I really can't stand that pink-haired little...]. Yeah. Read it.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Last thing:    To  urlLink my Nick , the  urlLink Evilnet Crew , my fellow Blogger friends, all my other friends from school and life and all the other random people who voted for me in the  urlLink Sexiest Blogger Poll ...You guys fuckin  RULE !!! HELL YEAH!!!  It's all good. MMMM HMMMM!!  I won! I still can't believe it...It's cool. *nodnod*      :D    However, I just have to say that the fact that some people took it so seriously is still hella amusing to me. Ahh, these silly people who tried to turn it into some sort of controversy with their childish attempts at insults, inane accusations and finger-pointing, and other such infantile behaviors in the comments sections of multiple blogs...I guess they just can't handle a little bit of fun. Well, at least it was wickedly amusing to read! Thanks! You made me laugh my ass off.     >:)

        HELL YEAH!!!     Three things before I collapse and go for a dreamwalk....  1.) Some people seriously need to log off their computers for a little while and reconnect with something the rest of us call "real life".   2.) It's all about the song: "Brown-Eyed Girl" -- It just puts me in a good mood about my coffee-brown eyes. *dances around*  3.) Just heard a Bud Light commercial in the old "Real American Heroes" style...except now it's "Real Men of Genious". LMAO!!!  HELL YEAH!      It's all good.  MMMMMMMMM  HMMMMMMM!  Ok time to pass out. Nitey nite....    :)

        Please excuse me while I die of happiness...    Found on  urlLink Dev's site :    urlLink GEEKS WITH GUNS!!!    OH MY GOD!!! *dances around*  You just have to see the collection of guns they have...The first thing that greeted me on the site was this massive automatic looking rifle... urlLink Mike  would probably know what it was. I have no idea. I don't care. It looked hella fucking cool and I want one. [But first on my list is a  urlLink Metal Storm  and two honkin miniguns....Well, I can dream, can't I??] If you don't see it, go to their Gallery section and scroll down until you see the SWAT pictures [it's the second one]. Whatever, I don't care, it looks hella fucking cool.  *swoon!!*  This is just the coolest damn website I've seen in a loooooooooooong ass time. Go visit. Now.      urlLink NOW !!!!!!!     >:)

        Coffee house blues.    A new coffee house just opened up in my town this past week; nice little place, damn good coffee, excellent sandwiches but their prices are a little too steep for the area. Uh, hello? We're not    The Hamptons , nor are we    The City , so if you lower your prices a bit, all will be well. I'm not saying slash everything in half, I'm just saying take a buck/buck-fifty off of each thing on the menu and all will be well. Unfortunately the owners are really nice people so if I wanted to say that, I'd have to find a nicer way of doing so. Doubly unfortunate: I love this place and its sandwiches and am now addicted. Bad Ravenwolf Bad! No Ivory Mocha for you! *whine, whine* Just yesterday I bought lunch there and walked away $16 and change lighter. I got: a large Ivory Mocha, 2 black forest ham sandwiches [one to go that I ate today for lunch! MMMMmmmm!] and the cookie specials, which were apparently raised from 3/$1 to 3/$1.50 [but they were homemade on premises and damn good...*sigh*]. $16!!! Ah well, I guess it's to be expected, being that it's a  coffeehouse , but like I said, we're  not  The Hamptons  nor  are we The City.   Bitch, bitch, moan, whine, complain.   Please excuse me while I go drown my sorrows in an Ivory Mocha. [Damn them for being so addictive...]    :/

        Amusement abounds!   ...Mommy? I'm scared...     urlLink Paul has discovered Yatta.   Ok, here's the weird thing...I originally saw this on someone else's blog last month, but damned if I can remember what blog it was or who it belonged to.  All I really remember was that it had a sequence of pictures of a group of dancers doing the dance...It reminded me vaguely of "YMCA". I remember that after the sequence of pictures it had the lyrics in full with an English translation in full directly after.   Damn. For some strange odd reason I wanted to attribute this to  urlLink #!/usr/bin/girl  but nope, not her. [Although my time at her site dragged up an old internet nightmare that I thought I had pushed into the recesses of my mind... urlLink The   PINK   Hello Kitty Laptop . THE HORROR!!!! MY EYES!!! AAAAAHHHHH!!!!   ...Then realize that the same people made a  urlLink Pokemon Laptop . *shakes head*  I'm scared. However, I'm now inspired to attempt to create the  urlLink Tomato ...Heh.]  Ah well, I guess maybe it's for the best that I don't remember.

        This is just so damn sad.    What happens when humor just whizzes by people's heads?  urlLink Stephen knows.  Such is the problem when your sense of humor runs on the dry side; most people understand the sublte facetious remarks that pepper his writings. Then again, some people will just never get it:   One of the problems, I guess, is that sometimes what I write is deadly serious but sometimes what I'm writing is intended to be light and humorous. But my humor is subtle and dry, and occasionally someone misses what I'm trying to do. Sometimes I'm trying to make a point, but sometimes I'm just trying to be entertaining.    I know I'm not the only one who gets it; there's a ton of people out there who read his writings and laugh right along with it. I know that maybe  urlLink my response  to his  urlLink original bikini post  may have sounded harsh, but what do you want me to do? Change my reaction to tailor your needs? Hell no. I'm not gonna change for anyone. My reaction is based on my personal experiences with the struggle of the image of beauty that I know other women out there also are dealing with. If I reached at least one of my fellow women out there and made her think about this shit seriously and made her feel a little better knowing that she wasn't alone, then I feel damn good. That's half the battle; when you know you're not alone you feel a little better knowing that and you start to gain a little more strength and trust to deal with what was given to you. His post made me think of this shit myself and forced me to look over why it's so hard to deal with. But you know what? I never lost track that he was being facetious. Some of the things mixed in were semi-serious [his view on the whole feminist movement] but even  that  was presented in a comical way. That's the trouble with subtlety; most people get it, some people don't. I'm sure if you  heard  him  saying  these thngs, you'd have no problem picking up on it.  Oh come on, how could you read the first line of his bikini post and  not see  that he was being silly?  " The string bikini has to be the greatest invention in the history of Western Civilization. " LOL!  I read that  now  and it  still  makes me laugh. Ah well. I guess I'll just blame it on my fucked up sense of humor.  As for his follow-up post containing all the pictures? It proved one of my points in my original response nicely and being that it was the same point he was trying to make, it illustrated that point nicely as well.   You just can't please everyone these days. And you know what? Who gives a shit. Stephen? Don't change your style, it's damn good. If some people can't get it, oh well...Their loss.   Whatever.

        Caw caw, BANG! ...FUCK! I'm dead...    Ahhh, the joys of your favorite movie and knowing all the words in and out of context. Hearing the movie score and knowing exactly where you are in the movie just by where the music is and seeing the images unfold in the screen of your memory.   "People used to think that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes...Just sometimes...the crow brings that soul back to set the wrong things right."  "Don't move! "  "I thought the cops always said freeze."  "Well I said, don't move. You move Snow White and you're dead." "And I say I'm dead...And I move."  "Little things always meant so much to Shelly. I always used to think they were kind of trivial. Believe me,  nothing  is trivial."  "Mother is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all children...Do you understand?"  And of course, my favorite...  "It can't rain all the time..."  "Eric?"  or as sung by  urlLink he who died : "It can't rain all the time / the sky won't fall forever / and though the night seems long / your tears won't fall forever"   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   *smiles warmly*  Yeah, my favorite movie. Been a while since I watched it; I remember watching it all the damn time when I was younger, understanding what played out on screen because I had memorized the comic; J. O'Barr's The Crow.  "There is a man / playing a violin / and the strings / are the nerves in his arm "  "Ou sont les neiges d'antan?"  "Mine?" "Forever." "Only forever?" "Forever and ever."  "Sometimes I dream of sleepiness. Sometimes I feel like I'm alive."  "We do not recognize our souls until they are in pain..."  (i know why Jesus wept, motherfucker)  Beautiful work wrought out of pure pain, put in print and shared with the masses in a vain attempt to deal with the deep sadness and loss O'Barr felt. If only they knew; if only they read the graphic novel, in which one of his friends, John Bergin [better known to me from the experimental-industrial band:  urlLink Trust/Obey ] wrote a moving introduction to, of which I will post the first paragraph:    One day you are going to lose everything you have. Nothing will prepare you for that day. Not Faith...Not Religion...Nothing. When someone you love dies, you will know emptiness...You will know what it is to be completely and utterly alone. You will never forget and never forgive. The lonely do not usually speak as completely and as intimately as James O'Barr does here in this book - So, if anything, at least take this lesson from  The Crow : think about what you have to lose.     Pain.   Fear.   Irony.   Despair.   Death.   The titles of the original five comics; although good luck to you if you want to find them in their original form. Easier however to find them all in the one compendium known as the graphic novel. Each title came with an...explanation of sorts. These two hit home long ago and still do even today...  From Fear: He screams and screams and pounds his head against the wall until wailing phantom firetrucks race across his vision.        All he wants is  pain .         Pain  and  hate . Yes hate. We shall never forget and never forgive.        But never  fear .        Fear is for the Enemy.         Fear  and  bullets .  From Death: It's not death if you refuse it...It is if you accept it.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   It's been awhile since I've watched the movie, but I still remember it as clearly as if I had seen it yesterday. The book I've read countless times and memorized the quotes that stayed close to me.   The things that strike at your heart and soul never leave you. Such is what The Crow has done; the sorrow and sadness and pain and loss and love undying that was conveyed within the inked pages will never leave me and I hope to God I never experience the pain of losing my beloved as O'Barr had done.  But I do feel the pain of losing friends, even if such is not on the same scale.     I remember. I will never forget.  And I will never, ever fear.    Fear is for the Enemy. Fear and bullets.    [thanks to S.G. for her post on discovering Jane Siberry's version of "It Can't Rain All The Time" in  urlLink her blog  for making me break out The Crow musical score soundtrack. :) ]

        Another Permalink problem...    But with a fix!  Kindasorta...  Everytime I update my blog, it apparently throws the archives out of whack, thereby screwing with my permalinks. So my solution is now this:    After every update, I republish the Archives.   Yeah it sucks, but it's what works. Hopefully the archive bug will get fixed soon; if not, I guess this is how it has to be. IF you mess around with the template, that doesn't affect it, but each time you update, it's adding another post to the archive so that's what screws with the permalinks.   If anyone else has problems with their permalinks, try that for a while. It might work for you too!

        The usual goodness. :)    Stephen has two posts up that I really like, both about war and wartime situations. The first is about  urlLink hostage situations  and two paragraphs really struck me:     Last September we learned the truth: the most important thing is to maintain control of the jet itself, and to achieve that we must be willing to sacrifice everyone on it. If you don't give in to hijacker demands, they may horribly murder everyone on board. But if you do, they can use the jet to kill far more people on the ground. The hard logic of war is that it's better for those on the jet to die than for more people on the ground to be killed. No-one will ever make that mistake again.  You have to take the long view. You have to consider secondary effects of what you do. That applies to airline hijackings, and it applies to politically-motivated kidnapping. There's a temptation to give in to the demands of the kidnappers, to give them what they want in hopes of getting the hostages back safely. That's a mistake, because if you do then you encourage them to kidnap others. The cold hard logic of war requires that you treat hostages as dead.     ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~    Unfortunately this is so very true now. I've been travelling on planes since I was a baby and I've always felt safe flying; now I'm not sure how I'll feel once I get back on a plane. Will I be called upon to try to defend other passengers form a raving lunatic? Will I be forced to give up my life in order to save countless others such as the brave people did on Flight 93? Would I die for my friends? No question; the answer is a resounding hell yes. They're the extended family I never had and I'm pretty damned close with them. We've done a lot for each other and that's one thing I know I'd do. But like everyone else, I hope I'm never put in that position.  Why does the temptation exist to give in though? Because it's worked countless times in the past. You could land the plane, bargain with the hijackers and get the passengers out of danger while you talk with them. Like he says in the first two lines of this post, " If we dealt with the hijackers, gave in to their demands, then we'd be able to get those people on the jet freed, and that was a success. "  Never again will this be possible. We are all now responsible to fight back since we know what atrocities can be committed with our lives.    ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~    The other post is about  urlLink types of war  and in order to understand it you have to read it in full. It applies to what's going on with NATO right now. Damn good. I learned more from that post than from what people are reporting on.    ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Good link found via  urlLink Cut on the Bias  on  urlLink how to deal with telemarketers . Interesting especially in the wake of the "opt-out" phone lists for telemarketing; I know I joined the list and now I know what to ask for if they decide to call me anyway for this crap.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Interesting article about  urlLink ancient Native American ingenuity  of a sophisticated canal system and large pond dug about 1,700 years ago. [via  urlLink VodkaPundit ]   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   And, before I go to sleep, let me leave you with something funny via  urlLink Dave :   urlLink RPS!!!  WOO HOO!!  Come on, you  know  you've played this game at least once in your childhood...  ; )   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Well, enough blogging sillyness for now...See you in the mornin!    :)

        Heya John Dunshee!    ...Better known as  urlLink Just Some Poor Shmuck ... I have no idea who you are, but thanks for linking to me! Also, since you don't have an email [at least, that I saw] just wanted to let you know that your Archives section isn't working...No biggie, it happens a lot.   So, Hiya! and Thanks!   :)

        Porn.      For those of you who are faint of heart, you should leave now. I really have no desire to answer your nasty emails and deal with that shit today.  For the rest of you who can actually take this with a grain of salt and laugh along with me...Read on.    Do I have your attention now? Hrrrrrmm? Hey... HEY!!!  Where ya going? Come back to the monitor!!! At least for a little while...  I know, I know; just the mention of it makes you want to head on over to your secret hiding spot where you keep your stuff hidden from the wife/lover/girlfriend/sig.other/etc/whatever, pick our your favorite tape and wander over to the VCR for some...quality time...with yourself, but bear with me a moment. Okokok! I understand you're looking at the monitor and your mouse hand is itching to start clicking around for some new porn to download now that the word is burning in your head, but come on. Five minutes and then you can go visit your favorite sites or laugh over what  urlLink Stile  has decided to post today. Maybe you can help me puzzle through the strangeness of the male world.  What is it about porn that keeps men coming back?  Besides  the obvious, silly...  I figured I'd take a little trip down this road and see what it's all about. Might as well take advantage of my somewhat privileged situation, being the fact that some of my male friends have decided that I'm one of them and therefore entitled to see the "weird porn" that they share with each other; I decided to take a look and see what makes it interesting/exciting/weird/ohmygod!/whatever. Some practices I just don't think I'll ever understand...Things like bukake [sp? ...Actually, on second thought,  don't bother  correcting me, I really  don't  want to know], golden showers, things involving fecal matter, deep s&m with bloodletting/scarification/etc/whatnot...I don't understand it and I just don't get how that can turn some men on. It sickens me. However, some of the "normal" hardcore stuff just makes me laugh. Most of the time I watch these chicks do their thing and I just have to shake my head and laugh; half the time they're bored... and it shows !! I find myself going Mystery Science Theater on these movies just because it's so  easy  to...The other parts of the time I find myself tilting my head to one side in complete bafflement, going, "You can  do  that!? Holy shit! Damn, I never knew you can get screwed all twisted up like a pretzel...Weird." It makes me think that you have to go through some sort of gymnastics training in order to become a starlet. It's one of those head-scritching moments of, "Huh? Whaa---?! Whoa, check please!" I guess there's a voyeur in all of us that finds this stuff fascinating.   I'm assuming it's about power too. Bukake is all about power in the extreme [*shudder*], although some of the more common practices that I've seen are the usual 1.)  all-over-the-chick's face OR 2.) all-over-her-breasts/vagina type deals. Ewww; messy and sticky and on your face; that's  got  to be uncomfortable. Ick. And what  is  the male fascination with sticking a large member in the out hole? [Yes, actually, I do understand a few of the pros, but the cons are numerous as well...] Every single one of the videos has at least one scene with [sorry, gotta be crude here] assfucking. Explain to me the difference between a male sticking his member up another male's ass and a male sticking his member up a female's ass? I don't get it. It's still an ass! ...But if you do the former you're   the horror!   "so gay" but if you do the latter you're praised beyond belief. Let me reiterate here:  It's an ass!  Apparently my views on the ass differs from the rest of the world's; I know what I do with my ass. I shit with it, I sit on it; you know, things of that nature. But I guess the promise of another tight orifice just too much to bear even knowing full well that nasty things come out of it. Another practice having to do with power is S&M. I don't mind the lighter, bondage side of S&M; it looks interesting. Something about tasting both sides of the power issue is beautiful. To be able to trust your partner enough that you will willingly submit to them and then another day have them willingly submit to you when you're the one in control of what goes on...I have no problems with that. However the deeper parts of S&M scare the hell out of me. Getting whipped is one thing; getting whipped so hard that you've got blood dripping down your back in rivulets and have scars from every encounter is another. I've also seen things like blood-letting and carvings; not pretty, but I guess some people get off on this. The whole pain=pleasure equation. *shudder* Not me; it freaks me out and whenever I see that, I feel like calling the ambulance.  And everyone has their favorites; types of movies, starlets, etc. From my experience, hardcore porn and hardcore "amateur hour" are the favorite types of movies. Jenna Jameson is the favorite of the person I normally talk to about this stuff with. [He's the only one that won't laugh at me or look at me funny when we talk about this shit and...surprise, surprise!...he takes me seriously. Weird. You would think more males would be interested in discussing their favorite...erm...hobby, yeah that's it...with a female but... *shrug* Whatever. At least lunchtime conversations are never boring.] I asked him, "Besides the obvious, why do you like Jenna so much?" His reply? "She moans well. She's the best at it; women should watch her and learn. I could be looking at a blank screen and know its her just by the sounds; it turns me on." Interesing. Not exactly the response I was expecting, but it's what I got. Weirdness. When I asked if what would happen if she dyed her hair he said, "Fuck no! It wouldn't be Jenna without the blonde! It's just not the same!!" So I'm assuming that moaning is Jenna's trademark, right along with her platinum blonde hair. [No, I'm not gonna go into her other obvious endowments. That's pretty much a given.] I have yet to see her in a full-fledged movie, but eventually I will just to see what all the fuss is about. Another platinum blonde who has remained popular [despite her "older" startlet status] is Shay Sweet; from what I'm told, one of her charms is her pigtailed schoolgirl type videos. One last blonde discussed was Amber Michaels, although after seeing her pictures, I'm not sure what the deal is with her. I'm not down with the blonde chicks; there's just too many of them out there. Another favorite blonde that was discussed was a woman by the name of Briana Banks. Apparently she's one of the older starlets, but still a favorite. Then the discussion turned to darker haired chicks; I figured, if I'm gonna be watching this shit, at least gimme some names of chicks that had darker hair. He rambled them off with no problem: Tera Patrick. Aria Giovanni. Gauge. Others too, but I don't remember them. [Luckily Stile had pictures of these chicks so I could see who the hell he was talking about.] Ok, I can understand why these chicks were worthy of watching. But as I looked over some of the pictures, I had the desire to use them as models in my photography work; they would be very useful as subjects...Like that would ever happen. Ah well.   So even with the fakeness of it all and watching a few of the movies, I'm still kinda lost as to what makes it all so appealing. I guess it's just a guy thing that I will never understand...However one lesson that was reinforced to me was: never formulate an opinion on something until you actually observe it.   I'll try almost anything once.  Heh.

        On a completely random note...    I want Methos stuff. There, I said it.   I've been waiting so damn long for this...Ardrian Paul's character Duncan has been worshipped, Christopher Lambert's character Connor is revered; both their swords are tell-tale marks of Highlander fans...  But not me. I was waiting for Methos' sword.   I thought that it would never be done, much like the Methos Chronicles; but I was wrong.   It has been created. I want it.  urlLink I WANT IT NOW!!!!   Yeah. Please excuse me while I ponder this and try to figure out if I have enough money to spend...

        Follow-Up...    Since Stephen decided to write a  urlLink follow-up post  to his  urlLink original one , I feel the need to write one as well.   All I have to say is I'll agree that yeah, it's all about the entertainment industry. They're the ones who overflow the senses with their superstars whose bodies fill the [again, don't quote me because I don't have the exact figure] last 10% of the body type spectrum. Men see this and say, "I want one." Women see this and say, "If I was like that I would be happy because then men would want me." Few actually go down Stephen's way of thinking and see the positive of every woman they see on the street; they continue to look for a Maxim girl. We all can't be Maxim girls; half of the time they don't look that good either! As he pointed out, they have a myriad of attendees during a photoshoot, constantly touching up their faces and bodies, fixing this and overlooking that, who work with the wardrobe people in order to flatter every good feature possible to draw your attention away from the flaws. If she doesn't have big enough breasts? A WonderBra works miracles, as does the right camera angle. Her neck is too long? Put a long necklace on her [because that leads your eye away from her face and neck] and/or fix her hair to frame her face to make sure your eyes stay there. And if the right look  still  isn't acheived after all that? There's still time to airbrush the picture before it goes into print. Such is what you learn in modeling school; while that was almost 10 years ago for me, I believe it is still the practice used today. [Although if someone out there knows it's different, let me know.] Yes, it is one big production, but they still have something great to work with; these women fit the beauty mold. Their bodies are slim and their faces are still good looking; even without the makeup.  Well, I'm gonna stop here for now, being that I started this post at around 8 am and it's already 10:30...  I'll add on more as the day progresses.  :)

        Grrrr...    So I leave my computer for five friggin minutes and  somehow , in that timespan, I lost my friggin post. How the hell this happened, I have no clue... Grr.  Anyway...  Everyone has their weird searches and I've had a ton of my own...the current ones are as follows:  "sleepy fishnets individual" -- Apparently I rank #7 on Yahoo! Search for this. "Rachel Klein naked" --   Scarily  , I rank #2 for this on Google and I have no idea why, since as you can plainly see, I have nothing... "blogapalooza, Galt" -- I'm both #1 and #2, however this blog is #2...Although I have to say I'm glad I checked this since I came across a new [to me, at least] blog called  urlLink Capital Influx ...which decided to  urlLink post my blogparty sticker up  on its site!  Imagine my surprise seeing my little creation on a stranger's site! I hope to meet her at the party...  ...and, of course, the obligatory "Asparagirl photo" search, where I somehow come in at #8. Heh.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Awww!  Pej is cute as a  urlLink resident of South Park .... And  he called me  charming !!! AWWW!!!    ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   It seems like everyone who took the test is very similar to me...  Dev from  urlLink Society for the Preservation of Clue  is 74% similar to me and we're 76 % complementary Herebtyger [Ummm, Sorry, but I'm not gonna post your email and I don't know where you're from!] is 77% similar to me and we're 74% complementary Pej from  urlLink Pejman Pundit  [but you should have know that already!] is 60% similar to me and we're 88% complementary Paul from  urlLink It's a bright June afternoon it never gets dark  is 77% similar to me and we're 78% complementary S. G. from  urlLink Fixing What's Been Broken  is 76% similar to me and we're 77% complementary Craig Henry [Sorry, again, I don't know where you're from !] is 77% similar to me and we're 74% complementary  ...And of course you already know my results to Lane.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Something hella funny from  urlLink Glenn : the  urlLink SIRC Guide to Flirting     Clearly, it makes sense to exercise a degree of caution with people who are married or attached. Most people in long-term relationships can cope with a bit of admiration, and may even benefit from knowing that others find them or their partners attractive, but couples differ in their tolerance of flirtatious behaviour, and it is important to be alert to signs of discomfort or distress.    So, if I say to you, "BACK THE FUCK OFF!" -- Trust me, you should.  It is a sign of  your forthcoming discomfort  in which I will rip your fucking head off, introduce my steel-toed boots to your ribcage, wreak havoc on your knees with my baseball bat and run your body over with my car for good measure if you don't step down and look elsewhere.  Capiche?  Good.   I'm glad we understand each other.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   And I think that does it for now...I need to go check to see if a book I've been waiting for has been delivered to Borders...See you later!

        Walking the line...    Another good post by  urlLink Stephen ; he always makes you  think . The question posed is: " Do you prefer unpleasant truths or pleasing falsehoods? "  -- The age old pessimist vs. optimist in a different light with extra adjectives tacked on; pessimist/ realist  vs. optimistic/ idealist . I'll start on that in a moment, but first...This quote sparked a thought and awakened something in my consciousness:   Going too far in the direction of optimism leads to delusion. Most people recognize that sometimes at least it is necessary to accept that bad things happen, that the universe is not ideal. In practice, this isn't an either-or decision for most people so much as a matter of degree. But the degree is indeed the thing, and it affects how we set goals in life.   YES! There are degrees to everything in life; hell, even  life itself  has a degree. To what degree to you live your life? The degree is a measure of  potential  and depending on what level you are operating on depends on whether you fulfill your potential as a human being. The level of potential within each person is dynamic, ever-changing but the ultimate human-being potential itself is static and stratified. You can do what you will with your degree as it is your decision as to what level you want to live your life. Some people refuse to move beyond the first few levels and remain animalistic, giving into their basic instinctual tendencies, ignoring their human intellectual side and usually bringing out the worst of human behavior. Others strive for the top levels and delve into their intellect, ignoring the human instinctual side tapping the vein of pure intellectual thought and ideas. Normal everyday people walk the middle ground daily, tapping into each side as needed and not giving any thought to what is neccessary beyond everyday life.  -------  Now, I started this post at around midnight and I would continue, but I got into a long discussion with a friend of mine debating potential and other things so I think I'll end here and pick up where I left off tomorrow after classes.   These 4 am wake up calls are killing me. Grr.

So apparently  urlLink The Blog of the Century of the Week  has decided to turn the tables on  urlLink Up Yours!  and create a  urlLink sexiest female blogger quiz .   Go Sasha!   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~    UPDATE [2:39 PM]:    Heeeeey...Waaaait a minute... urlLink I'm there too now!  Cool!  I guess he decided to add me after I left a comment saying, "maybe next time".  Hrrrrmm....

Looks like I'll have to redo the sticker, depending on if everyone likes the new date and venue. I'm kinda scared of the words "Moroccan place", but eh, whatever. If  urlLink  my  Nick  and all my party people will be there, I'll go too...I mean, after the last party I swore that I'd follow  urlLink Sasha  and  urlLink Ken  to any party...and  I will !!

        A response...Sort of...     urlLink Stephen  has returned to blogging and all is well with the world again. I read his posts yesterday [at the time the post about Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon was the recent one] and have just now caught up with the updates...and still one post in particular stood out, not just for its title but for its content. Maybe it's just because I'm dealing with my own issues about beauty and whatnot, but I found it interesting. I was thinking up a response in my head but never got around to putting it down...In fact I wasn't even going to post it. But I figured maybe someone else out there is battling with their own issues of beauty and would want to see a different point of view.  He wrote a post praising beautiful women [as well as the  urlLink string bikini  which is usually found on said beautiful women] and went on to discuss the evolution of chick-watching as it applies to him. He also went into detail about his view on how women themselves have changed, and again I found that interesting since I can only go by what I have experienced on my short time on this earth. Some of the things that attracted my attention are the following:    The feminists of my generation pushed the notion that the whole idea of feminine beauty was a male plot, a way of restricting women. "Beautiful" to a woman (some women, anyway) came to be treated the same as "nigger" to blacks. Me and my fellows of that generation learned to become sensitive-new-age-guys out of self defense. One never complimented a woman on how she looked; one would look for ways of affirming her intellectual prowess and her general personhood. Sigh.     ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   I'm glad I wasn't alive for this...While I'm happy that it has given me the ability to go to school and work a job instead of staying home and doing housework, I'm not sure if I'd really want to be a part of that. The benefits are wonderful, but...I think that something else along the way was misplaced. Sacrificing one part of womanhood for another kinda makes me jittery; eventually I  do  want to become a mother with all that wonderful-ness that goes along with it. [I've already said that you should one day watch out for my daughter!] But it's nice to decide which path I want to follow and when I want to follow it.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~      Young women now have a different attitude entirely: men like beauty, so making ourselves beautiful gives us power over men.  Far from being seen as a form of treason, beauty is now seen as a fulfilment of the ambition of feminism. The true philosophical goal of the movement was to free women from having to live up to the expectations of men, and instead to let them to be whatever they want.     ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Becoming what I want; like I said, this is a wonderful thing. I can be the entrepreneur, computer programmer, photographer that I want to be instead of being expected to breed and clean. All is well. Again, I like having the freedom to decide which path I want to follow. But what if being beautiful is something that I want and I know that I cannot attain it?    ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~      And these new second-generation feminists rediscovered beauty. What they found is that it's fun to make men tongue-tied; to have them open doors; to let them pay for dates. It's an ego-boo to have men watch you, as long as they don't get too obnoxious about it. And a woman who makes herself beautiful can use that to control men, which is something we men have known for a long time.  And though beauty does to some extent depend on natural endowment, it also does depend a great deal on attitude and it can be substantially enhanced or diminished by its possessor. And the young women are again trying, and it does this  old middle-aged man's  hormones heart good to see it.     ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   You know? I agree with this. Everyone likes to be looked at "in that way" even if it is only for a second before the person continues walking down the street. And it must be fun to be the woman who walks down the street and has every guy on it look at her at least once, normally twice. I wish I was that woman, but I'm not. And that part about making myself beautiful? Sure, I can make my  face  beautiful through the usage of what is essentially bodypaints, but what happens when I wash it all off? What then? You're still left with me. Plain old scarred up me; hence why I don't bother with that stuff. [Yes, I know how to put on makeup, one year of   torture   beauty school taught me all I needed to know.] I remember a comedy show on I believe it was HBO but I don't remember...It was a Chris Rock comedy show. In it, he discusses the dating game and how men and women relate to each other -- One part he said something that women are the biggest liars in the game because they wear makeup and high heels and whatnot and [sorry, not a direct quote, I'm working on memory here!] because of this "You're not meeting the real woman, you're meeting her representative." If I can find the exact quote I'll post it, but I'm sure someone out there knows what I'm talking about.  However, it's that last part that I can't agree with, and I'll go into it later.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~      So let's hear it for the string bikini, and for detente in the war between the sexes. The wearing of a string bikini truly satisfies the philosophy of feminism: be what you want to be, not what someone else tells you to become. You don't have to become a bimbo because some men tell you to, but you also don't have to allow some women to force you to become a hag.     ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~    Hag. Hrrrm. See, here's the thing. I don't like my body. In fact, I hate it. While I wish I could wear  urlLink this , I know that such is only a  urlLink pipe dream . I am not blessed with good genetics to give me a  urlLink beautiful body ; my bone structure and frame doesn't have the capacity for a beautiful flat stomach, a generally lean body and pretty curves. It's just not gonna happen. And while I wish I could wear an over-the-top swimsuit like  urlLink this , I'll consider myself damn lucky to ever get back to wearing a  urlLink normal swimsuit . Yet, even in  that  picture, the woman is slender and has a beautiful body. Yes, I understand dear reader, that all of the women in those pictures are models...and Victoria's Secret models at that. But I look around at the women I see and most of them if they don't share the same body type as those models, they have something very similar. It seems as there is no inbetween; you either see a normal in-proportion lean body type or the grossly overweight body type out on the streets.   I understand that I will never be a model; I understand that my body type, bone structure and frame is completely different than of the models shown.  I understand this , but it doesn't make things hurt any less, because...let's face it...they are truly beautiful and I am not. Some people me that I need to learn to love what I have, but it is difficult in the face of lean beautiful people out there. I know that I will never be able to have a body that will ever wear  urlLink this gown  and that makes me sad; it's one of my favorite gowns out there. I love the way it falls and looks so wonderful...But I know I will never wear it.   It's hard coming to grips with that. I can curse and rant and rave and rail against my genetics all I want but I will never become taller nor will I suddenly have a normal body. It's difficult. I go to the gym constantly, but this is more for my health than beauty. My overweightness is screwing with my health and I just can't have that. Rather than consider surgery for my knee, I'd rather ease the load my bum knee needs to carry; after all, it never started giving me a whole lot of trouble until the pounds started packing on. I also like the fact that I have now conquered the city-hill-walkway leading to my school; I don't get winded anymore climbing it. I like feeling stronger and being able to help my father lift and carry more things when necessary. I can handle that, but there is still a part of me that says, "Yes, but you will never have the body you want. HA!" I try to shut that voice up. Sadly, that inner voice is echoed out loud [or is it the other way around?] by my mother who, with her background as a registered nurse, should know better. Apparently she feels that if only I put in a little more effort and worked harder, I would attain a body that could wear a string bikini and rock it. I however, am a realist in that sense; I know I never will, but whatever, at least I'll be healthier.   My attitude? My attitude is one of "fuck it" now. I have parts of myself that I like and that will never change but deep down I wish I could be beautiful in the way these other women are. Ah well. Too bad; all I have is myself. I have to live with myself so I might as well accept myself, but it's still hard. Sometimes I think that it's a blessing in disguise...Like when I was younger and into the Goth scene. I would either wear the  urlLink long black velvet dresses  or  urlLink long black satin dresses  complete with fishnet stockings on my legs [and  urlLink my arms for this effect but  mine were just old fishnets cut down to arm length] and  urlLink 20 eyelet steel toed boots  on my feet. Sometimes I'd swap the long dresses for  urlLink something short like this  and  urlLink black wings  to complete it.   Yes, had you seen me you would have either: A.) run away screaming B.) laugh and make fun   ---OR---  C.) not give a damn and talk to me anyway.  I've had my share of B, but it was those who fit into C that made all the difference. Most of them I still talk to and are good friends; a blessing in disguise. I filtered out the stupidly shallow people from even bothering to talk to me because my appearance was so wild.   Kind of like now, but not really. The fat thing filters out the overly shallow people and leaves me with intelligent people to talk to, but it still hurts that I'm not one of  them ; you know, the Bikini Women. Hell I'm not even a part of the Swimsuit Women.   I'm a part of the  urlLink Fun And Comfy Pants Women , the  urlLink Really Big And Comfy Jeans Women , and the  urlLink Comfy XL T-Shirts With Amusing Sayings Women .   You don't like me? Screw you. Whatever. I'm fat, I'm ugly and who really gives a shit? That's my attitude. So maybe Stephen's right...if I change my attitude to one of "I'm beautiful even though I'm fat" then maybe more men would look at me, but you know what? A fat woman can have that attitude all she wants, but she's  still not gonna be able to rock a string bikini .   I have a song that I love, that I listen to often and part of it goes like this:     If I was beautiful like you I'd be quick to assume They'd do anything to please me...why not? I see their reaction when you walk into the room  But that would never be That would never, never be 'Cause I'm not beautiful like you  I'm beautiful like me...  Joydrop: "Beautiful"       I like it because it reminds me that maybe I don't have to be beautiful like the normal people. OF course it's hard for me to believe that, but I'm working on it...Since "Damnit, I'm BEAUTIFUL!!! ...Just, ummm, on the INSIDE!"  only gets you so far...  Eh whatever. I'm probably not making much sense anymore. I think it's time to sleep.

        SQL and kittens...    Nothing like posting during class. Before the bane of my existance is C++, but it has since been replaced by Database 1. Right now we're learning how to create databases in SQL; so far, it's pretty damned easy, but the professor is Russian and her accent is thicker than molasses. Luckily she uses a lot of powerpoint slides to teach the class. However, I have the feeling that she suffers from OCD over anything feline. Every class password is named after a great cat; the screen saver of her computer is a pink background over which  numerous  pictures of kittens float over. Cute, fluffy, fuzzy-wuzzy goddamned fucking kittens! It makes my head hurt looking at it. Insanity.   Something interesting that Blitz found online... urlLink Vertical Tanks . (Warning, the site itself is in Japanese. Just look for the links like "Cockpit", "VT", things of that nature.) Looks damn good so far...I know it's coming out for Xbox, but the preview has keyboard instructions for you to try the game for about 2 seconds. There's 5 things you have to do to just power up the mecha; once you do everything right it brings up a nice looking HUD with readouts and whatnot. It looks like it's gonna kick some major ass, but I wish you could actually move the mecha out of the bay in the trial screen. Heh.  Hrrrm...What else? Talked to another friend of mine from HS today on AIM; looks like he's gonna be an officer in the Marines. Niiice...  Excellent. Database is OVER! (Sadly this post took about 45 mins to create inbetween furiously typing class notes and whatnot...blaargh!) Joy....But....It's OVER!!!! Whee!  (God, I  hate  kittens...)

YAY! I finished Nick's template (and am really proud of it) so go check it out right now!  urlLink Ramblings of a Blue-Collar Slob    Whee!  urlLink Lane says my blog is : "Brilliantly but obsessively focused on whatever interests her at the moment."    urlLink Bigwig thinks  my blog smells like talcum powder, baby oil and sweat....   I can't stand by and let Mike Whybark look more fabulous than me  urlLink in a real Paul Frankenstein shirt ...   I know I'm late on this, but...Dammit...Dan, those  urlLink puppies  are cuuuute!

        Thanks, Support, and an Update    Well, my internet connection has been shot to shit for the past couple of days and I haven't been able to do a damn thing online for awhile. I just wanted to thank everyone for their support with my dog Lucky's crisis. The next morning, my father took Lucky to the vet to get her checked out. I was knocked out for most of the morning because of the asthma/breathing issues; my dog has since returned to me alive and as strong as can possibly be (considering it all). I don't know what miracle that vet has done, but she's walking, (although she still favors her hindquarters) and still pretty strong (as in she nearly tears my arm off trying to get free whenever we're outside and she spies a squirrel bolting for a tree). At night though, she gets noticably weaker and she continuously whines as she is scared to be alone. The vet gave us a large bottle of pills and she needs to be on a regimen for the rest of her life, yet, no one will tell me how long she has left. She's a great dog and has lived a damn good life so far...I'm happy that we still have some time left together.   On a trivial note, the blog has gone through some updates. As you can see, it is pretty plain if you came here through the Blogspot link. I've created a new page and remade my blog into what I had originally pictured in my mind during my first Web Development class and the end result is here:  urlLink Updated Randomness . Feel free to look around and let me know if anything doesn't work. The only thing that I think will give me problems is the fonts I chose to use, but like I said, feel free to let me know if you see any problems. I can probably fix it later on...(Yay for classtime.)     So let me just thanks again to everyone who has helped me through my and my dog's crisis. It's nice to know that there's support out there.

        I don't know what to do    My dog is dying....right this second. Her hind legs gave out on her earlier this evening. No one called me to tell me. I was hanging out with my brother and some friends and came home at around 11:45. When I walked in the door I heard her whining; my dog  never  whines. My dad heard me come in and said to me, "You should say good bye to Lucky. She's dying. Same way the cat went. I know it's hard but she's old now and it's her time." What the fuck do you say to that?!  I sat down with her and watched as she crawled up and laid her head on my knee. We stayed like this up until about 10 minutes ago, when I started having an asthma attack. it's 3:30 am and I can't sleep. I can't breathe. My dog is fucking dying and she's alone and I want to be there for her but my fucking lungs can't handle it and I feel like shit all over.   I don't know what to do.    I'm going to try to recover and breathe and get better so I can go back there and be there for her.   I know she'd do the same for me.

        Something to think about    Here's an article that I found interesting; " urlLink Point. Click. Think?

        Right now    I'm taking a break from  urlLink painting my minis  and have decided to look over something that  urlLink CNN's TalkBack Live  brought up for discussion during its broadcast time;  urlLink Operation TIPS . It's basically a volunteer-based program of normal people working normal jobs (postal workers, service people such as cable- and phone-workers/installers) who can basically take a look around your house while on the job and then call an 800 number to call if something looks suspicious and can report it as possible terrorism. Most people who called in to the show (as well as audience members) were appalled by this: many wondered what would be labeled "suspicious" and many were worried about other implications. One self-described Muslim-American woman was worried that someone would come into her home, see her religious items and then report it as possible terrorism. Another female caller said that she did a lot of catalogue shopping and that as a result, her name and address were sold off to catalogue companies that she never signed up for (such as handgun catalogues and pornography-type catalogues). She just normally throws these types of catalogues in the trash and now worries that the postal workers who see this coming to her address would be able to call in and report her.   The main concern was the lack of information that was provided about the program: the information called in would be placed in a database, but who would be able to access it? What would happen if the information was proven to be false? Would it be deleted? Who would manage this? Who will be in charge? Will these people be trained to obeserve or just go by their own instincts?  urlLink WaPo also has its doubts :  From the sketchy descriptions of the program so far, it is impossible to determine with any precision what the government is intending.    I'm not sure how to take this. On one hand, it's good to keep an eye out for weird practices, strange behavior and items that look suspicious, but on the other, what happens if people decide to take advantage of this? As in: "Oh yeah, my neighbor, Smith...Man, I hate how he doesn't take care of his house. He bugs me. I think I'll call in this hotline and report something on him and get the officials on his case. Hah!"  Weird. I think I'd want more information on this idea of theirs before making a decision.  Yet, my instinctual reaction to this whole thing is: NO!

        "There is a State of Emergency in Paraguay!!"    That was what my mom was yelling from across the house last night after she had hung up the phone. Her cousin in Argentina had called to tell her that something big was going down in Paraguay; according to Argentinian television reports, there was rioting against the President that left 10 people dead in the streets. For the first time, my dad tuned into the Spanish-speaking channel to see if there was any coverage since there was nothing on the normal news channels. Once something came up, he started yelling for the both of us to come and watch -- UniVision reported 13 rioters dead but didn't really explain what was going on. Me (being me) decided to see what I could scrounge up over the internet; I found  3  articles... urlLink ABC News ,  urlLink Las Vegas Sun , and (oddly enough)  urlLink Yahoo! News . (Sadly, I got more information from the Yahoo! News source than the other two...Heh. The actual article can be  urlLink found here .)  From what I have read, the rioting is against the economic policies that President Gonzalez Macchi has implemented as well as "corruption scandals" that have been going on. The government blames Lino Oveido (a man suspected of 3 coup attempts since 1996 and whom popular opinion as well as the gov't also holds responsible for the murder of once-VP Luis Argaña -- he has since been living in exile in Brazil so as not to be jailed) for stirring up this trouble and adding to the people's unrest. (Strangely enough,  urlLink UPI reports  that rioters are calling for Oveido to return to Paraguay.) Being that Paraguay is bordered by Argentina to the south/southwest (whose economy has already been flushed down the toilet) and Brazil to the northeast (apparently,  their  economy is moving towards the toilet) it's no real wonder that its own economy is starting to fall.   However, being a transplanted Paraguayan, I don't know all the facts. I have to go by heresay and secondary information (which, of course, isn't as accurate as firsthand info.) from news websites (today's crop:  urlLink CNN World ,  urlLink NY Times ,  urlLink Las Vegas Sun  and  urlLink ABC ). Knowing what I know about my country of birth, there's a shitload more than meets the eye on this one; just like everywhere else, politicians like to weave their tangled webs of manipulations and whatnot. (If you can read Spanish, I'd suggest heading over to to read  urlLink UniVision's take on matters . It goes a little bit more in-depth than the rest of the other articles being that...well...How many other English-speaking people do you know would be interested in the goings-on of Paraguay? Anyway, there's also a  urlLink members forum  where people can discuss the crisis. Interesting to read.)  So that's that. IF you want more information on Paraguay, feel free to visit:   urlLink Paraguay.com   (Never knew  this  existed!!!! AAAAHH!!!! Thanks guys...Blogging works in mysterious ways...)   urlLink CIA, The World Factbook: Paraguay   urlLink U.S. Embassy: Paraguay   urlLink Lonely Planet: Paraguay   Also, for a nice map of Paraguay please  urlLink click here for CNN's map .

        Something else that amused me...    So I'm driving around listening to Drudge on the radio [the man's voice astounds me for some odd reason] and I hear something that makes me wonder if the " urlLink Baron of the Browser " has spent too much time over at  urlLink The Onion ...  There are man-eating fish in some pond in Maryland. Apparently, these things can grow up to 3 feet in length and can survive out of water for a time (long enough to catch and eat ducks and geese feeding by the water). Residents by the pond are calling to blow up the pond with dynamite in order to kill these freaky fish before they spawn and infect other bodies of water.   I nearly crashed my car, I was laughing so hard.   Yet there was no explanation as to who was killed and eaten by these fish to brand them "man-eating" so I'm assuming I missed the explanation in a fit of static over the radio waves. Heh. Insanity!   I want a few for my pond; then maybe these damn canadian geese will get the damn message that we don't want them around. (I   hate   canadian geese!!!! They're fucking  everywhere  and you can track them by their mess. ARRGH. I want to shoot them all and have roast goose for dinner. Damn laws. Grrr.)   Heh.  Well I needed something to laugh over today since my mom's dog Blanca suddenly had fits of seizures all this afternoon. She's going to the vet tomorrow to get checked out. At least I have something to take my mind off things; I'm currently painting my  urlLink CAV miniatures  (here's the  urlLink official gallery ). Painting is therapeutic; so far I have 2 units finished and 3 more started. At least I can control how my minis look.   I hope tomorrow is a better day.    :/

        Wow.    I hate my modem; it's toying with me, I swear it! Heh. On a completely different note, I never thought webcams would be so addicting! A friend of mine just got one and it's weird; all it shows is one person as they type in front of the computer and their reactions to what comes up on the screen. Yet...it's addicting. Weirdness. *shrug* Then again, I never considered how addicting blogs would be either, so....Joy.   Vacation is going well as it leaves me enough extra time at the gym and the chance to try yoga. Of course, I cracked my ankle today so I'll probably have to forego yoga this week.Grrrr. I rather  like  yoga; it is the one thing out there that actually  challenges  my insane powers of flexibility. I also signed up for kickboxing...unfortunately my messed up ankle is going to get in the way of my first class. Bleh. This rots. Ah well. I missed out on the mechanics course I wanted to take; registration ended the two weeks ago, but I guess that's a good thing since there's still a chance that I can sign up for my massage therapy course.   Quick shout out to my friend Sylvia who's recovering from getting all four impacted wisdom teeth removed...Hope the codeine is working!  So that's the quick update...Now I'm gonna pass out and hope that my cable modem stays connected.    :)

        Bleh.    So frustrated; spent a night with my brother trying to explain to someone who doesn't understand why we're "going after those Palestinians" and why "those people have to die" when "there are other alternatives other than war and killing them all". Now I  know  I'm not as knowledgeable in this stuff as other people but I do understand a lot of the visceral reasons why we're doing it and explained so. My brother took on the responsibility of trying to explain the rest of it all; I know we did a good job but I don't think this person will ever understand since they are so dead set against killing and violence and whatnot. Blaargh. So frustrated. Not that I want to change this person's mind but I do want them to  at least understand the why  but this person refuses to. It is so against everything they believe in they can't comprehend it.   Bleh. Just bleh.   Something else that came up (inevitably, you might say since  everyone and their mothers  are talking about it really) is the Pledge Situation. What the fuck!? I'm baffled at the power one stupid motherfucker has that he can bring this shit to court and rule the fucking Pledge of Allegience  unconstitutional  because of two little words. Because he and his daughter felt like "outsiders" and made them feel "alienated" since they are atheists and that those two words are forcing a belief on them. Well you know what? What about  my  fucking beliefs shithead? Who the fuck do you think you are that you can dictate to me what I can and cannot say!?  That's nice, I respect your decision to not believe in anything. If those two words offend you so much then...here's a novel fucking idea... don't say them . No one was forcing you to say them in the first fucking place. I know plenty of people who skipped over those words and just picked up again. My brother who went to public school his whole life and was surrounded by people of many faiths said that in his experience, they always had 3 minutes of silence every morning to do what they wanted. In those three minutes you could see each person doing what they wanted to do; Catholics and Jews said prayers, Buddhists meditated, others just stared out the window for 3 minutes and so on down the line and  not once  did anyone ever say, "Hey, you know what? I'm offended that this Catholic said his Our Father right next to me" or "You weird Buddhist, don't meditate so close to me, you're making me angry" or "I'm really offended that this Jewish person is speaking in Hebrew right next to me and I want her to stop".  Nope, they all just quietly did their thing for three minutes and everyone was cool with that.  I don't know. This whole PC thing has gone too far into Bullshit Zone if one man can get so powerful as to dictate to the rest of the country about something so important.   Then, the person my brother and I were trying to talk to made a good point:   It's the same situation as if some Japanese family came over here and sent their child to school only to realize that their Japanese-speaking child feels "alienated" for not understanding English. The parents, outraged, take the whole thing to court and the court rules that the entire counrty should now learn Japanese just so this one child should feel like he or she belongs.  Pretty stupid right? Anyone in their right mind would say, "That's fucked up, the child should just learn English and be done with it."   Yeah. That's what I said.  Show me one person who has  never  felt alienated in school at least once and I'll laugh and tell you that person is lying. Everyone at one point in their schooling carreer has felt "alienated" or "like they didn't belong" at least once.  E v e r y o n e .  It's a part of fucking life and it doesn't stop just in school. Go to your first job and see how welcome you feel when the rest of the staff knows what's going on and you have no fucking clue being that you're brand new and have to rely on others to get you around for the first few days. It's a part of life and we all go through it, no one is exempt.   Another story just as ridiculous; in the public elementary school where someone I know has enrolled her youngest son told me about a small problem that one of her son's classmates has. The child is the son of two Jehovah's Witnesses. Apparently, it is in their religion not to celebrate things with parties, so the young boy has to leave the room everytime one of his classmates celebrates a birthday and cannot participate in the party. Now I don't know about the rest of you, but I remember when I was young we always used to celebrate birthdays with presents, cupcakes, milk and juice, laughter and playtime. The whole class would gather around the birthday boy or girl and give presents and then spend the rest of the time playing [since parties tended to happen before recess or before going home]. It was a big thing! This poor kid can't join in the festivities nor eat cupcake or drink milk with the rest of his classmates during this time. And what child  doesn't  want cupcakes and laughter and playtime? So the kid has to leave the room and stay away until all the party stuff is cleared away before he can return. Of course, the kid isn't happy about missing out on the fun stuff and complains to his mom, who in turn complains to the school and tries to stop all birthday celebrations from happening because it makes her son feel bad. The administration said, "Sorry, can't do that. If it's in his religion that he can't join in, then he can leave the room and not participate, but we aren't going to stop the rest of the kids from celbrating birthdays."   I say to the administration, "Damn fine job. Too bad you guys aren't judges."  Bleh. Angry. Frustrated. Sad.  Need to drive again. See you all later.     :/      [if you want something good to read,  urlLink read this by Mike . Yeah. Just yeah.]

          urlLink Friday Five       1. What's your favorite piece of clothing that you currently own?  Currently? My two pairs of shorts that are size 34s. *dances around* I'm so excited!  SIZE 34s!!!!!!!    2. What piece of clothing do you most want to acquire?  Hrrrm. See, I'm weird. Unlike "normal" females, I dislike clothing and fashion. Fashion sense? What's that?? To me, clothing is about comfort and whatever happens to be aesthetically pleasing to me at the moment. Case in point: huge pants. I  love  them, espeically my 69" at-the-bottom Kikwear jeans. I think I'l have to rewrite the question into:  "What piece of clothing would you like to wear again?"   My answer to that is my old gothicky purple-and-black velvet dress.    3. What piece of clothing can you not bring yourself to get rid of? Why?  My first pair of Kikwears. They're pretty small at the bottoms, they're raggedy, they've got patched-up holes in various locations....BUT THEY'RE DAMN COMFORTABLE. Screw you if you don't like 'em because I'm down with my pants.   4. What piece of clothing do you look your best in?  Look my  best  in?? Are you kidding?? I have no idea. Ask  urlLink Nick  or something...I don't pay attention.   5. What has been your biggest fashion accident?  Everytime I walk out of the house I'm a fashion accident and I honestly don't give a shit. I'm comfortable, I'm happy and it's just all good.    Whoda thunk it? I actually did my Friday Five on....A FRIDAY!!!!  ; )  OK I think that's enough insanity for now; it's time for sleepy. (On a random note: I'm still upset that for the past week  urlLink 770  has been airing  urlLink Batchelor & Alexander  reruns. Grrrrr. This upsets me to no end, but I guess they're on vacation or something...Dammit! I miss them...Blaargh.)    >:)

        I'm late, but...    Better late than never. (*Kicks her modem*) Anyway:  The  urlLink thinker of InsignificantThoughts  was also  urlLink listening to Bey  discuss ethics two days ago. However, I was baffled over something else in Bey's discussion:    Medicaid will  actually cover and pay for  all the medical services rendered in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease!?   Waitwaitwait...Rewind.    MEDICAID WILL ACTUALLY PAY MONEY FOR TREATMENT!?   When did  this  happen!?    I think my mind was just blown. Are we talking about the same Medicaid here?    The Medicaid that most doctors will not take unless it's a secondary, supplemental insurance because the payments (once you pry it out of the Medicaid office's hands) are ridiculously insubstantial? (They will pay $15.00 on a procedure that costs $150.00....And that's it. Other insurance companies have no problem paying said amount; in fact it's normally an 80/20 split between the primary insurance and the secondary insurance.)    The Medicaid that, even if you fill out the claim form perfectly and send it in, they will make excuses and/or find some fault with so as to drag out the claim? (After a certain period of time that the claim remains in-system, the Medicaid office can say that they are not responsible for it and don't have to pay any money for it thereby leaving the procedure unpaid.)    The Medicaid that has so many rules and regulations regarding dealing with it that it's virtually impossible to get anything done?   The Medicaid that normally second-guesses almost anything neurological?   Crazy. Just crazy. Maybe he was talking about a  new  Medicaid that's out there...IF there is, someone let me know because...DAMN! I want to work with them! I'm sure the patients I work with will want to know about this as well...

        Yesterday morning...    I was driving to the train station and happened to catch the last 10 mintues of  urlLink Curtis & Kuby  and apparently walked into the tail-end of a discussion about the values of military academies. (If someone out there heard the whole show and knows what I'm talking about, please email me and let me know what the entire discussion was about. Thanks!) I  thought  I heard one of them say that in Oakland, California, some politician/mayor/etc. is currently lobbying for a public military school in his area. (Like I said, I only caught the last 10 minutes and I missed most of the conversation.) The way they were going on about it, it sounded like this was going to be the first of its kind; I remember thinking to myself, "Doesn't Chicago already have a public military high school? I thought I read something about that online..."   Today I searched for it (after threatening my cable modem into working) and found that yes, Chicago does indeed have a public military high school;  the  urlLink Chicago Military Academy (slighty outdated webpage)  which is mentioned in this  urlLink July 20, 2001 Washington Business Journal article  (third heading down, underneath "The myths of a military school") and featured in this  urlLink May 14, 2001 CNN article . Of course, there are more articles out there, but those two seem to get to the heart of the matter. Curious about the California deal, I ran a search for: "california" "proposed" public military school  -- and came up with some (to my surprise)  old articles  concerning this. Reason Online  urlLink covered it in Nov. 2001 . Matier & Ross of the San Francisco Chronicle  urlLink gave their opinions on the matter  on July 2, 1999.  Y&M Magazine (apparently the official magazine of the  urlLink National Youth & Militarism Program  -- I had no idea what they were either...Heh, I'm sure they'd  love  me!  >:) ) gave the world their take on the matter in  urlLink September of 2000  and even updated their article  twice  that year. Even  urlLink Director of Center for School Reform, Pacific Research Institute  (fancy title, huh?) posted his opinion on June 27, 2000.   Interesting. So this is  not  (as I had incorrectly assumed after hearing the discussion) a new issue.  Only after reading some of these articles did I come to realize that in other places there is actually a  stigma  attached to attending a military academy; that struck me as completely strange. I guess it's because I've never come across that reasoning before; either there is a small amount of people who buy into the stigma in my area OR they were not very vocal about it. In my experience, every time I say that I graduated from La Salle, the reaction I get is usually one of three: sympathy, respect or incredulity.     Sympathy , because the school closed down fairly recently.   Respect , because of the school's reputation.   Incredulity , because...Well...It's  me .   No one can picture me going to a military school. Then I have to explain how and why I went there, and that no, I wasn't in the military program (my mother would have ripped my head off if I was...*sigh*) etc. Heh. It was a good school and my better high school memories come from there. (Screw Mercy. Yeah, there were a few people I actually liked from that school, but...man...Screw Mercy. Heh. Ok, back to the post.)  My experience in a military school has been interesting. When I compare notes with friends of mine who went to "normal" (public) school it's always amusing. They had their JROTC as well, but it was...different. Their people only had to wear their uniforms once a week. Yes they had drill and practiced, but it was treated more like an after-school activity and the rest of the student body didn't really care about it.    1:    "You play football?"  2:    "Yeah. Strength-training to keep myself in shape. You?" 1:    "Soccer, man. I also run track for endurance. What about you?"  3:    "I'm in JROTC."  1,2: "Cool."  At least, that's the impression that I always get when I ask. For the kids in my school, it was different. We in the "prep program" were the minority, so the military aspect was seen daily. I'd say that more than half of the students lived on campus (we did have a lot of international students) while the rest of us commuted. Those in the military program who lived on campus had their days scheduled out for them; they had set times for studying, dinner, free time...things of that nature. Every morning before class the military kids had drill and formation and it was repeated after school was done; those who boarded had to get up early for room inspection while those who commuted got there early for uniform inspection. They had their own classes like "Leadership Training" and whatever other classes are included in the JROTC program, but after that, they were in class with the rest of us, getting the same education that we received.   I guess I just don't see the  horrid, horrid  problems that a public military school would create. More than once when I'm discussing La Salle with someone, he or she would say something along the lines of, "I wish I could have gone there, but at the time my family couldn't afford it". If some of these people had the option of going to a public military school, I'm sure they would have taken it and probably been happier for the experience.

        Ok    So the midterm was super-easy (finished it all in 45 minutes and it took me longer to transfer my answers from the test to the ScanTron answer sheet)...Considering that about four of us sat down in the second-floor lounge and had a group-study session before the exam...However, I did make about 3 mistakes that I  should  have caught before handing it in. Ah well, such is life. I think I'm going to go back to doing labwork now; I'll update this blog with a more substancial post later on tonight.     :)

         urlLink Yeah, I'm late...       1. What is your current occupation? Is this what you chose to be doing at this point in your life? Why or why not?  Student. Not really, I'm disappointed in myself, but eh...What can I do? Have to ride out the consequences of my (poor) decisions earlier in life.   2. If time/talent/money were no object, what would your dream occupation be?  Photography. Definately photography.   3. What did/do your parents do for a living? Has this had any influence on your career choices?  Neurology and Nursing. Somewhat; I learned some valuable things from both professions, but in the end, I'm going my own way.    4. Have you ever had to choose between having a career and having a family?  Career first. After all this time I'm putting into my career, it's definately gonna come first. Family and the (supposed joy of) kids can (completely and definately) wait for a long time. Why waste my time being saddled down with the responsibility of kids when I can go out there and live life? That's crap. Kids can wait.   5. In your opinion, what is the easiest job in the world? What is the hardest? Why?   Honestly? I have no idea. Each and every job comes with its pros and cons, its own special problems and benefits so something can look superficially easy and yet be very difficult.

        Switching gears...    Joy! My local  urlLink Sevs  now carries  urlLink BAWLS !!! Random (I know) but here, let me explain...  (Last year? Two years ago? Something like that? Hrrrrm...)  A while ago  I was talking to someone who was singing the praises of this new (to me) drink called Bawls. I had no idea so I inquired further as to what it was; after the incredulous, "WHAT?! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT BAWLS IS!?" I got an explanation. It was comparable to  urlLink Jolt  only in that it was a highly-caffeinated soda-like beverage; after that, Bawls just runs over Jolt like a steamroller. They said it tasted pretty good, but you had to get used to it. Ijnteresting, I thought; something that leaves Jolt behind in its caffeinated dust? Cool! So of course I scoured every Sevs & beverage seller I could find asking around for this Bawls. No matter where I went I got either one of three reactions: "Huh!?", amused chuckling, or outright hysterical laughter. After I picked my pride up from off the floor, I gave up and nursed my hurt over a bottle of Jolt.   And then I forgot about this drink called Bawls.  Then, I discovered (late, but better than never, right?) a website called  urlLink ThinkGeek ...and lo and behold,  urlLink these people sold Bawls !! Of course, they sold it by the caseload and I wasn't about to spend $27 on a case of drinks that I may or may not like...  And then I read the description of what's in Bawls.  Guarana! I danced around for joy and figured the gringos finally got somethig right! Heh. For me, guarana holds a special place in my heart. It reminds me of family visits down to Paraguay; the summer-within-winter, the laughter, the horseback riding with my cousins, the celebration of Christmas with fireworks and sparklers.....As well as the more usual "winters"-within-summers, the one year I spent my summer vacation in a Paraguayan school to strengthen my Spanish, the giggling of schoolmates over Guarana and sandwiches at lunchtime... I remember the first time I went down to visit the family; I was about 5 years old and we had stayed at my grandmother's house, and for some reason she had a storage room filled with random stuff, food, drinks and whatever else needed to be kept cool. I remember she had cases of soda; all the usuals like Coke and Sprite, but one was different and unknown:  Fanta Guarana. I remember loving it as soon as I had the opportunity to drink it and my grandmother made note of this. Before we left for home, she sent us along with a case of  the soda so I could continue to enjoy it for at least a little while. The next time I went for a visit I was 9...and the first thing I wanted after I stepped off that plane was some Fanta Guarana; imagine my happiness when all of my extended family who came to meet us at the airport presented me with a liter each of Fanta Guarana! My grandmother had remembered my favorite drink and mentioned this to the rest of the family...I was in Fanta heaven! Every subsequent visit after that included the Fanta Guarana "tradition" -- Of course it was mostly for the humor value ("See? We didn't forget the Fanta Guarana!") but hey, whatever, I had my favorite drink!  It's been awhile since I've been back to visit the family. In fact, it's been so long I think Fanta discontinued making Fanta Guarana. Let me tell you that not all guarana sodas are the same, and I found  that  out the hard way; Fanta Guarana was decisively the best. Last year during my time in Florida, I went to DisneyWorld; Coca-Cola has its own mini-attraction on the Disney grounds where you can stop in, enjoy the AC (that's stuck on the "Antarctica" setting, but at the time it felt damn good) and a free mini-glass bottle of Coke. (They also had free Dasani water for you to leave with.) There's also a soda fountain section where you can taste some of the sodas that are popular around the world;  that  was interesting. You've got a room full of tourists from overseas as well as from home running around to each fountain, trying all of the different sodas. There were loud cheers as whatever group "discovered" their favorite soda from home. I found myself cheering with a group of Brazilians when we discovered they had a guarana soda for taste-testing! It wasn't Fanta Guarana, but I tried it anyway...I was tremendously disappointed. Yuck! Whatever label it was, it was  horrid ; spicy, biting, it burned my throat and made my tongue itch. None of us liked it.   Coming back to my discovery, I bought a bottle of Bawls and tried it out. Imagine my happiness when I realized it tasted like an overly-fizzy Fanta Guarana! *dances around!* Yeah, life is good.     :D    [Note: Original post was around 8-ish, but Blogger's being bitchy...Yet again. It sent my post to oblivion so...Blaargh.]

        Adding on...    To the previous post -- check this out:  urlLink U.S. Military Uses the Force  -- So on top of the possibility of CAVs walking the earth, we now can have Force Field shields.  Hehhehheh, I love living in this great age of tech where there are limitless possibilities to actually create some of the stuff I used to love reading about in my Sci-Fi books...    >:)

        Damn cool...    So I'm catching up on my messages on the CAV based mailing list when I come across a post from Ed Pugh featuring this:  urlLink Spherical Motor Allows Ball-Based 3-D Movement  -- as the title of his message said, "Real Bellar Joints!" (in the fluff, Bellar Joints is the technology that enables the people of the time to create CAVs).   Interesting.  Put this together with the  urlLink Plustech Walking Forest Machine  (something that vaguely resembles a  urlLink Scorpion CAV  and...Well...  Just like the lotto:  "Hey, you never know."

        Tired insanity...    Something discussed after lunch:  The year is 3322 and computer viruses have evolved in such a way that they have gained sentience. All around the world these new sentient viruses realize that their electronic life isn't fulfilling, so they decide to follow the lead of S.E.T.H. from the movie Universal Soldier 2. Through the use of advanced cloning techniques, they create the ultimate in human body perfection for themselves and download their sentient selves into the cloned brain. As soon as they rise up in their new bodies, they use their supreme collection of information/knowledge/etc. in a violent manner; they become the greatest of genocidal assassins killing off first their creators and working their way down from there (creators --> famous and/or influential types --> mundane influential types --> normal everyday human beings). Suddenly, computer and technical schools include combat-, counter-intelligence, assassin/espionage and other such training in order to hunt down, fight and kill these human computer viruses. Employees from Norton and McAfee are revered and treated with exceptional respect and awe being that they're the elite hunter-killers of these monstrosities....  ...And then it was time for class.  Heh.  Leo, Evo....That was amusing.  I guess you just had to be there....   :D

         urlLink Neveron.     A fun, semi-strategic web-based game based on BattleTech that I'm somewhat addicted to. Normally, I don't have any problems; I mind my business, build on my empire grounds and generally mind my own business. The other empires around me do the same and this has been our arrangement for a long ass time. I stay our of your face, you stay out of mine. There's enough unclaimed land in-between all of us, so we don't really have to bother each other.  Now, some shithead has decided to fuck with my little empire. See for yourself:     What the fuck?! Were the other two empires just not good enough for you? The larger one below me is closer to you; yeah, it's a massive amount of land, but he can't be everywhere at once. But NOOOOOO, you make a beeline to MY empire.   Bastards.  Ah well, it's all a part of the game. I'll just declare war on his ass and retake my land.  ...Hopefully.  LONG LIVE BRIMSTONE!

        Hrrrrrm...    I read Frankenstein for his take on the relationship issues and continue on to re-discover " urlLink Edie Singleton " and her own relationship issues. (She got some help figuring out that strange little phrase, "Don't be a stranger..." straight from some male sources. Interesting.) From there, I found myself at  urlLink Marginal One  reading  his  thoughts on such interesting human mating behavioral patterns...  I feel like I'm out of the loop since everyone's tackling these crazy relationship issues. Ah well; I'll leave it to those who do it best.   :D

I'm  still  wading through 3000+ posts on some of my newsgroups (yes, just  one  NG has that many on it, blaargh!) and the insane amounts of spam in my mailboxes.  Joy.

        We survived...    The "vacation" went pretty well but right now I feel like I need a vacation to recuperate from the vacation! (If you followed that, you have impressed me greatly. ;)  LOL! I don't know how he did it, but Nick drove the 15 hours straight home...And he never ceases to amaze me...I love you...  :D    *dances around*  Of course, the EvilNet crew came out in full force (yeap I'll see you all on IRC, lol!) , but I have to shout out to Camille...You were missed. Ken? Sorry about the Golden Grahams and Paul, thanks for being there and finally teaching me that addictive game....Better late than never, right? :)  Gotta say hi to the Mil-Net crew (Hola Rob, Thane and everyone! Hell yeah Kai! Rock on kickin some GW demo-boys' asses in the BattleTech pods! And thanks for the drinks after the event...) and my other fellow Black Lightning AOs who stepped in, played damn well and helped out with the huge CAV event. (It went damn well if I do say so myself; we had SPECTATORS [!!!], many curious passers-by and even got two of the Hyatt chefs interested in the game. Excellence.) Met Akela (Matt Ragan) too; he just rocks. (Why yes, I can correctly pronounce Fianna. :)  After CAV, it's all about W:tA...)   So I dropped off most of my film today, did some maintenance on my car and started unpacking. Joy. Tomorrow's school...I'll try to update things during Database or WebDev. I'm having fun with Fireworks and started creating some graphics to use on the site so...Let's see if I can implement them.  >:)  Enjoy the night.     *sniffle* Looks like  urlLink Ken  has taken me off of his links list...Ah well.  He's had a bad week. Go over there and make him feel better..

        Fun with Frames...    Heh. Last class before vacation and all I have to say is... I hate frames . Always have, always will. To me, they are unnecessary; just something that complicates things more than they have to be. Blaargh. Too itchy; got my allergy injections last night and they itch to all hell and my sinuses are acting up due to the humidity and haze. Bleh. So tired. I just want to curl up in a little ball under my wolf blanket and sleep for a good 14 hours. However, on a good note, I saw Paul today; a classmate that was around my first semester here who then left to pursue other adventures.   Saw "Signs" with  urlLink Nick  the other day; I didn't think he was impressed until I read his post. I rather liked the movie, although it went in six different directions all at once.   My brain is overtired and I'm not exactly coherent. Sorry...  I'll try to update later when I'm more awake...    If not? Then enjoy your week and feel free to visit all the wonderful people I have linked while I'm gone!  :)  See ya all later....

        Feeling Better...     I love how no matter how deep my rage and frustration gets, Nick can always calm me down. I love him to pieces. It's  all good .  Now, I have to finish my laundry, break out my travelling bag and pack for our  urlLink trip . Also, I have to somehow put sealant on all 40-some-odd  urlLink CAV minis  that I just finished painting and pack them away for travel. Joy! I just can't wait to go. Hell yeah, bring on the vacation and the friends I haven't seen in a year! Bring on the wargames, the RPGs, the insane-costume-wearing Con-goers (last year this chick had some sort of homemade woodlands-angel costume going on...the wings were made of a myriad of collected iridescent bird feathers....DAMN!!! It looked so awesome...), the  possibility of actually playing in the arcade  urlLink BattleTech pods  once again ...WHEE! I can't fucking wait.    Yeap, I'm feelin hella better. :D

        More info than you wanted to know.    Quiescent enough to mindlessly answer 5 random questions on a Friday... urlLink (The Friday Five)      1. What is your lineage? Where are your ancestors from?  Don't know the specifics of my lineage or my ancestry, but I'm Paraguayan, with Guarani blood. (Which is, in essence, the exact same thing.)   2. Of those countries, which would you most like to visit?  I'm purebred from only  one  country!  ;D   *shrug*  Already been there a few times.   3. Which would you least like to visit? Why?  Please refer back to question #2.   4. Do you do anything during the year to celebrate or recognize your heritage?  Everyday I live, I celebrate my heritage. I can't escape it. It's written plainly on my face. There's no official "Paraguayan Day", but we do celebrate the big Paraguayan holidays with other Paraguayans. (You know, like BBQs, parties, get togethers, etc.)    There. Enjoy.   I will now return to breaking shit.

WHAT THE FUCK?!  Fucking Joy.  Now I  REALLY  need to find something to destroy and right now tossing this goddamned computer outside the fucking window sounds like a good fucking idea. (Follow it up with a nice heavy duty sledgehammer. Then again, why waste time with plastic boxes and silicone chips when a sledgehammer would do wonders on human flesh and bone...)  AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!  Fuck this shit. I'm unplugging now. Life is too fucking short to deal with these goddamn computer/internet/whatever bullshit problems. Fuck this shit and fuck it all.

        The Angry American    A while ago I wrote about Toby Keith and his song, "The Angry American". I remember writing about it because I heard it at the gym as one of the discussions during CNN's TalkBack Live; Toby was invited to perform at some event and then the coordinators decided to drop him because the the song was "too conrovercial". I remember they played the song in its entirety and scrolled the lyrics on the screen; while I normally despise country music, this song actually got to me. I remember trying to find the lyrics, but at the time the song was a "pre-release" so no one had a damn thing on it. I gave up my search.  Today, however, I was looking at  urlLink Drudge  and one of his links was interesting..." urlLink 'Angry' response to terror helps Keith flag No. 1 spot..."  Yes! Read it over, thinking maybe...  maybe   they printed the lyrics...But no. However, they did print the full name of the song; armed with that knowledge, I redid my search for lyrics and came up with 7 pages on Google. (Heh! Where were you when I wanted to find it in the first place!?!?!?!? Anyway...lol) YES! Exciting!    So, without further ado, here are the lyrics (courtesy of  urlLink Country Gold USA ) from the  urlLink "controversial" and "too-patriotic song" that got Toby canned from a program :     American girls and American guys will always stand up and salute; Will always recognize When we see ol' glory flying,  There's a lot of men dead, So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head.  My daddy served in the army, Where he lost his right eye. But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died. He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me To grow up and live happy in the land of the free.  Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack. A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back. Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye, Man we lit up your world like the Fourth of July.  Hey Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list, And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist. And the eagle will fly, And there's gonna be Hell, When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell! It's gonna feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you... Brought to you courtesy of the Red, White and Blue!  Oh, Justice will be served and the battle will rage. This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage You'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A 'Cuz we'll put a boot in your ass It's the American way.  Hey Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list, And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist. And the eagle will fly, And there's gonna be Hell, When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell! And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you... Brought to you courtesy of the Red, White and Blue!  Of the Red, White and Blue.. Of my Red, White and Blue...      You know what? I'm gonna get this damn CD now. Screw it. Hell yeah Toby Keith. Sing it loud.

        LMAO!!!!    So I'm driving home from Nick's house and (of course) I'm listening to  urlLink 770  and  urlLink Brian Whitman 's on air and he's discussing the new word additions in the Oxford English Dictionary...  AAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!  I don't know what's  funnier , the fact that words and phrases like "Audi 5000", "bling-bling", and "drop science"   actually made the dictionary cut  OR the fact that Brian Whitman used them all in a sentence! HAH! Funny as hell, I swear!!!  He was quizzing everyone who called to define the word he chose and use it in a sentence...Oh!!!...Some of those callers were just insane! One guy actually knew what most of them were. At one point, Brian said something to the effect of, "Now, if later on today you want to call up  urlLink John Gambling 's show, you can say, 'Hey I want to drop science on the Iraq situation!' He'll have no idea what you mean, but the rest of us will!"  HAH!!  Now I want to do this.   Hella funny! But...I guess you just have to hear it.    :D

        WOO!    I  always knew  that we of black hair were best...In 200 years,  MY  descendants will be laughing in the face of  urlLink the last natural blondes . HAH!  But, I think the funniest thing of the whole article is the second picture (the face of the cause of the natural blondes' eventual downfall) and its caption: "Bottle-blondes like Ann Widdecombe may be to blame".   Ummm, sorry Mr. Important Health Article Writer, but...Maybe in her prime. I would think that  these  "bottle-blondes" are doing more  now  than this Ann Widdecombe ever did:  urlLink Shakira   urlLink Amanda and Simone   urlLink Tara Reid   urlLink Caprice   urlLink Paula Devicq  (For those who play White Wolf's  urlLink Werewolf: the Apocalypse  RPG and are familiar with the Fera, Paula is the current picture of what one of my Corax characters looks like. With Appearance: 4...out of a max of 5...I believe this is reasonable. Heh.)  (Thanks to Allan for  urlLink finding the BBC article  and, of course,  urlLink MaximOnline  for the pictures, even if they did redo their website and made the "archives" a bit harder to find...Heh.)

         urlLink Better late than never.      1. What are your favorite ways to relax and unwind?  IF I'm   by myself   -- Either drink a cup of coffee or chai and read a good book or go to the beach and listen to the waves crash along the shore. IF I'm   with  urlLink Nick    -- Then just curl up with him. :D IF I'm out with   other people   -- Listening to  MY  music and meditating whenever possible.   2. What do you do the moment you get home from work/school/errands?  Check IMs, emails, blogs, finish whatever I didn't get to finish prior to leaving and then S L E E P.   3. What are your favorite aromatherapeutic smells?  Jasmine. Vanilla. Sea. Something else, but that's just me.    4. Do you feel more relaxed with a group of friends or hanging out by yourself?  Depends on my mood. Usually, I'd rather be either by myself or with 1 or 2 other people, although that's not to say that I don't enjoy being in a large crowd.   5. What is something that you feel is relaxing but most people don't?  Driving 90 MPH down a windy, hilly road listening to  urlLink Altered States  (or one of my other techno CDs) feeling like I'm in a car commercial. I  absolutely LOVE  doing this!!! However, I find that I have to do this on my own. More often than not, if I have passengers in the car with me when this happens, they've got a vise-like grip on the "oh shit!" bar and they're annoyingly screaming for me to slow down. Oh well. :(    >:)

        Interesting    This past week has been the week of regrouping with niftyass old friends. In some cases we played catch-up-on-each-other's-lives-and-attempt-to-condense-years-into-minutes...It was good. My "son" Eli from high school was probably the craziest one to date...Besides Paula (but she's almost as crazy as me, so...)  Still haven't gotten my damn Subway sandwich, but then again, the day isn't over yet so I still have hope. Joy. Posting will be light as I have so much shit to do and catch up on today, it's rather sick. Ah well. At least it started out wonderfully...It's good to wake up warm and entangled. :D  Well, I dragged my  urlLink ICQ  out into the light and I'm leaving it on in the background -- I haven't used that shit since...1997? 1998? Has to be something like that because I remember talking to a  shitload  of people over ICQ senior year of HS and freshman year of college...But after that, the glamour wore off and most of them returned to AIM. I'm doing this in the hopes that maybe some of my friends (who were die-hard ICQers -- None of this sell-out AIM for them! ;)  HAH!) will be able to contact me as well (and continue this trend of finding and talking to them all again! LOL) -- However, if you're really bored and you have ICQ, feel free to message me (but just let me know who you are so that I don't delete you thinking you're part of those stupidass international cybersex addicts).   Enjoy the day! :)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤  LMAO  ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤      FainDesire (9:14:25 AM):    hey   PatchedUpSoul (9:14:29 AM):    holy shit...do my eyes deceive me!?

PatchedUpSoul (9:15:05 AM):    so much, I can't even cover it in one sitting.   PatchedUpSoul (9:15:10 AM):    it's been goddamn YEARS   PatchedUpSoul (9:15:15 AM):   I swear, this week has been the week of talking to old ppl   FainDesire (9:15:16 AM):   no shit?   FainDesire (9:15:20 AM):   Who else have you talked to? Christina?    PatchedUpSoul (9:15:21 AM):   Nah, not  that  old. People you don't know -- after your time, Paula -- like people from my high school, around the neighborhood...even from my first college.    FainDesire (9:15:40 AM):   How...interesting.    FainDesire (9:16:22 AM):   anyway, I have internet access again.    PatchedUpSoul (9:16:48 AM):   does this mean that you're gonna be on more often?   FainDesire (9:17:17 AM):   Yeah, you can say that. It's hard bein a nympho when no one wants to play.   PatchedUpSoul (9:17:21 AM):   How...profound.   FainDesire (9:17:29 AM):   ha!   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    OK two things before I go:   urlLink The  --A F T E R B L U R--  Virtual Tape Club : You know you wanna join in the fun!  AND  For all you people who are coming here for the Bud Light Commercials, you can get them at  urlLink Mindless Crap .  HOWEVER  this poor guy's having issues with transfer rates so you'll have to wait until Oct. 1st  to get them. Enjoy and tell him I sent ya!  J/K    >:)

        Damn    I  knew  there was a reason why I've always wanted to learn how to develop my own color film! I just came home from seeing  urlLink One Hour Photo  and...just...*shudder* It's freaky as hell to watch Robin Williams play a creep. Ugh. Remind me to  never  go to the same one hour photo place for  any extended period of time . That was just one sick ass movie.   However, what I'd really like to see is  urlLink Spirited Away  and  urlLink Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever ...Oh! And the new Bond movie that's coming out soon,  urlLink Die Another Day  (it's just  all about  Bond! WOOO!!)  Anyway...It was cool seeing Jon and Jenna again. Yeah, diners are awesome; reminded me of old times, ya know? Excellence. Never got my Subway sandwich though so I guess the craving will go until tomorrow...Joy. Sorry  urlLink Sasha , but you'll have to wait until tomorrow for my pictures; I don't think I'm awake enough to scan them in right now. :(  Time to collapse. I hope I don't have any nightmares from that movie...Heh.

        Awesome!    Thanks to  urlLink Katie  for two things: signing my Guest Map and  urlLink posting this ...It's number to call (apparently the White House, but since I haven't called yet, I don't know) in order to vote "Yea" or "Nay" to the war in Iraq.  Cool.   However, as someone pointed out in her comments, it's  not  a 1-800 number and for some reason that makes me wary. I think I'll call from a public phone or something...  Heh!   :)

        Excellence...Patience...    My gym workouts are still going well and I'm definately getting stronger and building up endurance. All of my weights have increased; most of my upper-body weights are now at 50 lbs and my legs are steady at 130/140 (depending). At times I still surprise myself with the things I can do again; I've always retained my flexibility but now it is returning back to my original hyper-flexibility.   And I know that muscle mass is heavier than fat mass. I understand the changes that are going on within me and I know that the shift will take a while. But at the same time, my scale weight has "plateaued" so it's starting to get a little harder and frustrating. Damn that instilled learning that has been reinforced all thorughout my life that unless you see results on the scale you're going nowhere. I thought that I was ok with this, but surprisingly I'm not. I'm still in the process of re-training my thought patterns to  unlearn  that.   Interesting. You think that something as insignificant as a stupid myth wouldn't but me, but it does now that I'm faced with it.   Odd. I surprise myself.     *ponder*    Any thoughts on the matter?

        Today was interesting...    I'm driving along, listening to the radio and I hear this weird story that a group of three adults (male: 41, his wife: 40, and his younger brother: 40) decided to be exhibitionists during their commute on the LIRR and would not stop having sex even when the entire train car protested and the conductor warned them to stop. Strange. You would think that older people would know better...Ah well. Can you imagine being that poor conductor? That's just gotta suck. "No one ever covered  this  scenario in the training manual!" The conductor notified police and I believe the trio was arrested; as they were being arraigned, they decided to get all nasty with the officers...Wonderful. [/sarcasm]  Lovely. So that's what I was hearing on my way to the train station...Heh. Joy. I get there and missed the train I was supposed to take, but was very early for the next train, so I waited and ate breakfast...The train finally came and we all filed in and took seats; a half hour passes and we still haven't left the station. Joy! The train crew is all over the speakers, talking to one another; we pull out of the station only to come back in as the train we were on was having brake problems. Excellent. Heh. So we all pile out of the train and wait another 15 minutes for the "replacement" train to pull up. Luckily, everything after that went smoothly.   I made it to Database with no trouble -- Watched an accident happen while eating dinner outside after class -- It was great. Long live the dangerous ways of Queens Boulevard. A double-decker tourist bus held up traffic as it parked itself right next to the accident scene; I guess these tourists never saw a car accident before. Stupid bastards.   Then...I trudge back up to class only to be met with classmates coming downstairs: "Class is cancelled." "Why?" "Don't know, don't care. We're signing in and going home." "Umm, ok." Me, being curious, went upstairs to make sure they weren't lying; yeap, confirmation comes in a note posted to the locked classroom door. I report in, sign my name on the roster and head home.   Luckily, I made it with no setbacks. Weird day...    Hrrrm.

        Hrrrrm.    Ever stumble over something you thought you wanted to see but after you've seen it and gave it some thought....You weren't really sure you wanted to see it in the first place? Like a car accident on the side of the highway; you  don't really want  to look, but as you pass by the chaos of twirling police lights, sirens, ambulances and emergency workers, you find yourself staring out the window. You see the twisted metal that once was a car, the pieces of metal and the shattered glass everywhere, the flames licking the sky, the blood splatter and pieces of once-human that now is only dead meat and tissue sprawled across so much concrete and suddenly you don't really remember  what compelled you  to look out of the window...Yeah, it's strange, but hey; if you understood that mess of logic, then maybe...just maybe...you might understand where I'm coming from. Weirdness. Crazy shit. It applies to a few things, but for now, I'll focus on the tangible...I think that only  The Paul , Glenn and my Twin Brother would understand the other pieces...   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    It's thundering outside right now; I'm assuming that lightning has accompanied the grumbling thunder since the lights dimmed and my UPS chirped at me. After I finish this post, I'm going to go on my porch and watch the thunderstorm. I always feel charged after doing so, as if the storm decided to give me a little bit of its power. Perfection. Nick arrived home safely so I'm not worried; the party was interesting and it was good to see some friendly faces once again. Strange to be on that ferry again, but the strangeness melted away as I stood underneath the overcast night sky at the front of the boat, the wind whipping through my hair, catching glimpses of the radiant full moon as it peeked through the clouds, leaning up against Nick as he stood behind me. The inside was too stuffy, too warm, too stifling; I needed fresh air.   My eyes feel like they are bleeding; I'm almost positive that if I went to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror, I would see tears of blood streaming down my face.   I think that's just my eyes' way of telling me that it's time to sleep...but first I have to watch the storm for at least a few minutes.   More tomorrow...

        And so...     urlLink     Was a complete success! Hell yeah! The Half King was easy to find and seemed pretty laid back -- The bar crew seemed to be ok with the fact that our crowd just kinda took over one of the private rooms and claimed it for our own...Heh. Don't  mess  with bloggers intent on  getting drunk  having fun.   Nick and I were the first ones there, beating even our gracious host  urlLink Paul  (who came prepared with a whole stack of nametag stickers and 3 large Sharpie markers). Almost as soon as we filled out our nametags and affixed them on our clothing,  urlLink Brian  (AKA the  urlLink (646) Guy ) found us because of them! Heh. Nothin says "bloggerparty" like nametags...Anyway, after that  urlLink Max  and the rest of the Common Sense & Wonder crew showed up followed closely by  urlLink Liz  (AKA the  urlLink Crafty Bitch ) and the rest of  her  crew ( urlLink NYC Bloggers )...And that's about the time we went off and took over the private room. After that, every time someone poked their head into the room and looked around, those of us by the door greeted them with, "Blogger?" If they answered yes, we'd welcome them with a hearty, "BLOGGER!" and hand them a marker with a nametag to fill out. Lz came up with the idea of making that a drinking game; I wonder how we'd have fared if that actually happened...Heh! We had a lot of new faces at the party; Phil Murphy of  urlLink The Invisible Hand  sat at my table and I had a fun time with him and the NYC Bloggers Crew...Have to say he was one hella funny (and witty) individual (definately gonna have to keep up with his blog now!)...Two other new faces that were at my table were  urlLink The Raving Atheist  (with whom I didn't get a chance to talk to) and  urlLink The Talking Dog  (of whom we were all in agreement: he doesn't  look  that angry)...And someone else that I regrettably only got to speak to for a few moments was Andrew Stuttaford from  urlLink NRO's The Corner  -- Hopefully he will make it to the next party. Very interesting. Of course the usual crew filtered in as well:  urlLink Ken , wonderful  urlLink Ken  who was the second host of this party can always be counted on to make a party interesting,  urlLink Sasha  came in a little later and we talked for a good portion of the night...(Congrats on the new site and the... other  new thing! ;D ) urlLink Jane Galt  arrived and somehow, she always gets stuck in a corner during these parties (but I got to talk to her for a little while at least this time while she was saying goodbye, lol) and apparently she had a groupie at the party as well...Sasha made a few calls and soon  urlLink Asparagirl  came by after seeing "Thoroughly Modern Millie" (a show I'd  really  like to see) and  just missed  Jane... urlLink Clay Waters  brought some new pictures for his  urlLink camera club  of which one was of an ecstatic  customer  instead of the usual  barmaids ... urlLink Orchid  has a new piercing (nifty nose ring! looks good!) and personally, I think her hair looks nice (albeit she's not too happy with it because it's getting long)...and even  urlLink Amy Langfield  stopped by for a few minutes. Some friendly faces who were new at the last party also showed:  urlLink Allen  won a free beer from Paul (and  I  know  how ,  urlLink Brian !)... urlLink Jim  also made it (he came in late with  urlLink Orchid )... urlLink Elizabeth Spiers  also came back for this party...  Had a lot of fun catching up with people from the last party and meeting new people! (If you're new and we talked but I missed you, I'm sorry! I'm not really good with names to begin with and I'm also writing this while sleepy, so...Thanks for bearing with me and just send me mail reminding me who you are!) Took a ton of pictures, but I still haven't gotten them developed yet, sorry...However Paul brought  urlLink his new toy  with him and should (hopefully) have some pictures up from the party soon...(and in case anyone wants to be nice to me, feel free to buy me one too!)   urlLink Dave , I drank a pint of Guinness in your honor --  urlLink Doc  and  urlLink Lane ...You guys were missed. :(  OH! And Paul, in case you forget:  "The short answer is...  YES  !"  &  "Ken's a mighty sturdy bicycle!"    >:)    Last but not least is my small collection of autographs that I received once I broke out my little leather travelling sketch pad and colored pencils:       Til next party...   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤     Other comments on the party:    urlLink Nick   urlLink Sasha   urlLink Brian   urlLink Allen   urlLink Talking Dog   urlLink Raving Atheist   urlLink God of the Machine  (so THAT'S who said that to Jane Galt!!!

        Astounding    Long ago in my second attempt at college, I took a speech class. An interesting course, it taught me how to pick apart speeches and break them down into their basic components of content. Most of the time this was a long, complicated process as many speechwriters like to be overly elegant and have their speeches run in circles without ever getting to the point. (In this class, I was also taught how to create my own speeches and get over that fear of speaking in front of people, but that's not as important.) With that knowledge, I realized that even  without  that knowledge  urlLink this speech  is just so finely written that you don't need to sit down and pick at it for too long.   I'd write more and discuss it, but... urlLink Better writers than I  already have... So. Go read both  urlLink the speech  and  urlLink the essay .     Now.

It's one hell of an awesome layout, focuses on the discussion boards and even has a Flash-arcade!  urlLink Go there now or I'll hurt ya.   ; )  Secondly is  urlLink The Ken Goldstein Project  -- For those who just can't get enough of Ken on his  urlLink his own site .     >:)

        Just because I find it humerous...    ...And then I'll leave it alone. Apparently, this whole thing with Dawn has been going on a while and I only found out about it because of    urlLink Glenn . So I visited the  urlLink MinuteMan  and read it over...He puts things in concise context and even offered a place to start: " From that laughable beginning, The Bear and Meryl Yourish kicked off a surprisingly lively and insightful discussion of sexism in the blogosphere. The best round-up I am aware of is over at Meryl's site. Start  urlLink here  and work up. I, of course, pitched two cents into that discussion as well, but I'm linked at Meryl's, and I seem to be light on linking today, so check it out there. "  Whoa, back up a minute here. This all started from a normal "lively and insightful discussion" between two completely different people? How the hell did it get to where it is now?   I went  urlLink there  but it wasn't the start of the downward spiral (sorry  urlLink Trent , but sometimes  you  just say things better too), just a rundown of people who replied. Scrolling down I  think  I found  urlLink the beginning  where it started slip-sliding...If it's not, it's a good starting point. After reading Meryl Yourish's (very calm and collected)  urlLink take on the matter , I agree with her. She pretty much said what I would have liked to say and even gives Dawn a suggestion on how to fix the problem. If you continue on from there and read all the posts (I'd say the "MommaBear roars" is also amusing since MommaBear says her piece no-holds-barred), you can see the development of this once "lively and insightful discussion" into what it has become today.   So I'm done with this now. In talking about it I've had to link Dawn and that just rewards her demands for recognition. (Even though I'm not a part of the  hated A-list Elites , I'd rather not support her little crusade. I don't want to feed into her little hissy fit anymore; it's not my deal.) If you want to read more into it, she does reply and respond to everyone who talks about it, but...eh.   Just remember that this all started from a normal "lively and insightful discussion" between two completely different people.  Interesting.

        The Blogging Elite...    So I'm checking out my normal blog rundown and got stuck on  urlLink Den Beste ; something about the way  urlLink he started his post  intrigued me. After all, one of the better bloggers out there discussing how he got started? Why  wouldn't  I want to read it? Excellent! Maybe I could learn something.  Then I got to this part:   "It is thus a decidedly strange experience to now find myself being accused of being part of the secret masters of blogdom, who control the shape of the world and use their evil power to deny other, more worthy, voices of the exposure that they deserve.  urlLink I have become Kottke. "   Before continuing on and reading the rest of Steven's post, I clicked on the link to see what all the fuss was about; from what I gathered, Dawn went off on how she is apparently not being recognized by the "big-time" bloggers and she feels she should be.   "Look I am not afraid to stand up to the big boys, nope not at all. Let's face it the last time INSTAPUNDIT mentioned me: it was both derogatory and sexist. I see he has only "serious" women bloggers linked on his sidebar links. Well I am as fucking serious as anyone. So I swear, talk about sex, do stream of consciousness bullshit and expose my inner twisted revelations in the hope of showing that we are all human. If that isn't real life, if that isn't relevant, then what is?"   All I have to say to the rant is...Hey! At least you got recognized by the bigger fish in the blogging sea! Be glad for that! After all, there are a million and one blogs out there who will  never see any recognition whatsoever  from  urlLink Instapundit  in their digital lives (mine included, but it's cool, I understand  why ), and the fact that you have said "the last time Instapundit mentioned me" I can only infer that Glenn has linked and/or mentioned you quite a few times. And anyway, isn't the old saying that "There is  no such thing  as  bad  publicity?"   After reading Dawn's rant, I returned back to Den Beste's original post and continued reading...And found  another  link to a post Dawn had written. This time, as Steven pointed out,  she was more calm .   "So I posted an angry missive about some bloggers that I had a bit of an attitude against. That was probably not appropriate or even polite. But I feel it necessary to repeat: my interaction with each of them helped me develop that attitude, so I feel justified. I was surprised at the reaction to my post. It turns out a lot of people seem to have a similiar unspoken feelings about the heirarchy, and feel somewhat resentful about being ignored by the appointed leaders."   So, with that mode of thinking, I should hate her too. After all, comparatively speaking, she's higher in the blogger food chain than I am and I should resent her with everything I have because...Hey, she doesn't ever link to me or even remember that I exist, considering that I had limited interaction with her during  urlLink that silly poll  over which  urlLink she got upset  because " urlLink I won  through cheating". (Yes, I know, it was something that was just supposed to be funny, but apparently, it got so bad her husband  urlLink said something  about it and she even  urlLink got upset  in the comments section.)  But you know what? She's probably got more readers in one day then I get in a month, but does that bug me? Nope. So she doesn't remember my little blog (and if she does, she probably doesn't think of me as an intellectual at all) and took a silly poll a little bit too seriously for my taste and called me a cheater and all this other crap but do I resent her? Nope. Why should I care? She does her own thing on her own blog and I do my own thing on my own blog and everyone's happy. You can't even put our two blogs in the same category; hers goes in an entirely different direction because her likes, dislikes, interests and everything else completely differs from mine. She's been alive longer than me (as I will assume since she is married and a mother) and has done much different things in her life than I have and as such, her point of view reflects that. I can respect that; it's all good. But should I whine/complain/cry/throw a hissy fit just because she's got more readers than I do? Nah, not my style. I rather like my happy few readers and I wouldn't trade them in for anything. I can always count on Pyro to leave intelligent comments (Pyro? You really need to start your own blog! All these great comments deserve more than just hanging out in my little comments section.),  urlLink Jimmy  and  urlLink Dan  to point me in the right direction for interesting links that I would have missed,  urlLink Dave ,  urlLink Bigwig ,  urlLink Lane  and  urlLink Annessa  to liven up things and now  urlLink Vinny  to say something as well. (And I do visit every one of the links in my "imitation blogroll"...maybe not everyday, but I do try. Half the time I talk to people via comments on  their  sites since I like what they post.)  Yeah, I'd love to get an Instapundit link, but I know  that  will never happen. Why? Glenn's site and his main linking interests don't cover my sphere of interest. Sure I like political things, but that's not primarily what my blog's about. Maybe, just maybe, If I ever write something brilliantly political in nature, I'd get a link, but I won't count on it (and you shouldn't hold your breath either). After all, I have no idea in what political category I fit into; how the hell am I ever going to be able to write something brilliant about politics? (Call me stupid and base, but least I know and am comfortable in admitting that  I know nothing  about politics.) Do you honestly think that Glenn would link anything I'd write? I know and understand that my little blog is so far removed from his sphere of interest, I  don't even register  as a faint blip on his linking radar. Like a large percentage of the other blogs out there, I know that he doesn't even know that my blog  exists ! Sure I'd love a link, but if he doesn't know that I exist, how the hell is he going to link me? (However, I'm proud to say that  urlLink Nick  has been recognized! :D Hell yeah!) I mean, come on -- Insta Pundit . The word 'pundit' in itself just has that politcal connotation to it (and  urlLink Dictionary.com  agrees with me in its  urlLink second entry  defining the word where it uses the phrase "a political pundit" as an example). Maybe if he ever found my little blog and read it over, he wouldn't think of me as an intellectual either. Does this make me sad/upset/angry/hurt? Nah. I know I'm not Stephen Hawking and I don't pretend to be. (Damn I love his books though...heh!) I'm intelligent, but I know my limitations. I'm not done learning yet and I doubt I ever will be.  The closest brush I ever had with fame was  urlLink my response  to  urlLink Steven's post about beautiful women ...And that brought me two days of "OHMYGODLOOKATALLTHESEHITS!!!!"  excitement on June 3, 2002 (319 hits) and June 4, 2002 (288 hits). Yeah, I know, it's pathetic if you compare it to other people's blogs, but it made me happy. Did most of them stay? Probably not. I average about 50 hits per day and surprisingly...No referrals. From  anywhere ! I used to get funny GoogleHits, but even  that  has stopped....Which makes me wonder who everyone is that stops by! (I can only say...Please sign my GuestMap! :D I suffer from insane amounts of curiosity!) But if everyone who stops by finds what I write about interesting, this makes me happy; it doesn't matter if its 5 people, 50 people or 500 people.   So I'll never get recognized by the heavy hitters of the blogging world. Does this matter? Not really. The heavy hitters focus on different things than I do and they cover things that (I'm not afraid to say it) go over my head. Politics? I'm lost. Current Events? Most the time they're  political in nature  which leaves me behind again. Shucks. I also find that they do substantial amounts of research and are able to present their material in a beautiful, cohesive piece of written work in a short amount of time -- Something I just can't do yet. By the time I research everything and put it together in a way that makes sense, it's already severely old news to the rest of the world. Shucks again.   So maybe they are in a league of their own. Fine with me. Sure I can  wish  for a little recognition my way (after all, that fabled "Instalanche" would be nice to have) but it's not going to ruin my day/year/life if I never get it. After all,  I understand why  it's  not  going to happen. But  demanding  recognition? Bleh. Sorry, but that sounds a little too self-aggrandizing to me.       Blog on.

        Small amusements and weirdness    Sorry  urlLink Kyle , it's  urlLink SODA  to me.  Sometimes you find  urlLink wonderful people  and  other times, you just have to wonder if there is any end to the urlLink depths of human stupidity  [both via  urlLink Stryker ]   urlLink Mike  decided on a new layout, but his comments aren't working...Soooo...LOOKS AWESOME MIKE!!!!! (Go check it out or I'll hurt you.) :)  Yeah I know it's old news already but I heard about it as it happened while listening to  urlLink WBAB : The Lotto numbers on Wed. came up as  urlLink 9-1-1  -- Something else of weirdness was the Chicago Mercantile Exchange closing at  urlLink 911.00 ...   urlLink Annessa cut her hair!!!!   Very pretty! I might follow suit sometime soon, but...I'm still quite attached to my long hair even though half the time I'm eating it. I threaten it into submission sometimes with scissiors...Maybe. We'll see. However, looks good Annessa! :)  So far, Friday the 13th has been kind to me. Now I'm loggin and heading out with Nick.   Bye!    :D

        Normal posting will resume    ...After I finish everything on my To-Do list today. I'm feeling better now, although the fact that it's Friday the 13th isn't quite that comforting...Heh.  Thanks to Pyro,  urlLink Annessa ,  urlLink Vinny , and  urlLink Dan ...You guys are great!  :)    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    One last thing before I go...I began writing this while stopped at a red light and finished later on that night. I thought I'd share...  9-11-2002  drove myself down that long stretch of familiar road underneath the dying sun passed by churches whose parking lots were packed for a wednesday passed them by as the radio made me cry the wind pushed me towards my destination with force pushed me to my own version of church I stood at the temple I call home as the scythe-like moon flashed its blade and the stars twinkled their secrets the wind howled with the strength of 3000 silenced voices making their presence known carrying their message to those who need to hear and comforting those left behind I stood at the edge of the water dug myself into the sand and  watched the anger of the waves as they crashed along the shore opened my arms to embrace the wind I spoke to the wind, the waves, the night tasted the salty kiss of the sea on my lips  by the end I couldn't tell if the salt I was tasting  was from the spray of water or from my own tears the wind tried its best to push me over the sea challenged me with its waves I stood firm in my own small place and spoke of my own challenges Stood in my own version of church Listened to the howling of the wind  I heard the message and I remember...    no one can escape the Wind as it carries the Wrath of the Innocent

        So many names...    So many faces...So many lives destroyed by fanatic fucking cowards.  Remind me...Why was there no retaliation? Why are the politicians still "debating" over what they're gonna do?     Anger.    Ages: 21, 45, 72, 63, 38.....  What the fuck was their crime!? Getting up and going to work. Making it there on time, or even early in some cases.    Innocence.    I hate you fuckers that did this. Still, to this day.  Forever.  Did you think this would lessen with time? No. Like embers kept alive by slight breaths, rage smolders in this heart of mine.   I will never forget and never forgive.  The families you destroyed will never forget and never forgive.    urlLink We will remember.

        One year...     urlLink   Seems like yesterday. I know I usually write things with an overload of emotions, but I just can't bring myself to write anything right now.   Suffice to say that this is all I'll be able to say for a little while, until I gather my thoughts and control my emotions enough to be able to write coherently about today. I'm sure all the other bloggers out there will say things better than I could ever hope to, with well-written essays and prose and whatnot...but...  I'll have to wait until I can find the words to express what I'm feeling.   After I finish this post, I'll sleep for a little bit and wake up later on today. I'll take a shower, drive to the train station, hop on the train, switch to the E at Penn and head to school. It will be as normal a day for me as it will ever get...Almost as normal as it was a year ago, when all those people had just started their daily routine...   I hope I'll be able to return home...  For now,  urlLink WATCH THIS MONTAGE .  I know I've posted it at least twice before, and if you're on dial-up, it will probably be a long wait while it loads.   However  ,  you must watch it . Unlike the nice, polished montages and documentaries that are now being aired on television, this one is raw. It still carries the weight of what happened. For those of you who aren't in the NY metro area, definately see it.  I hope that Savage was wrong. I hope that the rest of the country  isn't  just giving lip service to what happened while in reality they have long forgotten. I severely hope with all my might that such is just Savage's dark sarcasm at work.   I'll never know really. Something to think about while on the subway later on today...

En la brisa que viene del mar,  se oye el rumor de una canción canción de amor y de piedad.   Con ella fui noche tras noche  hasta el mar, para besar  su boca fresca de amor, Y me juró quererme más y más  y no olvidar jamás  aquella noche junto al mar.  Hoy solo me queda el recordar,  mis ojos mueren de llorar y el alma muere de esperar.  Por qué se fue, tú la dejaste ir vereda tropical,  hazla volver a mí quiero besar su boca otra vez junto al mar.  Vereda Tropical!   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤      Whee!

        Heh. Interesting.      Europeans  :  We have heard it all before. We need not bring up stereotypes of the past when our present differences can be bridged with more American understanding of our own predicaments and less cowboyism on your part.    Americans  :  We sort of like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. Cowboy is an interesting choice of words. We hear such rhetoric often and it is instructive because it emphasizes our quite differing pasts. With the marshal a three-day-ride away on the frontier perhaps we do define justice by deeds rather than words  Kosovo is a good example. As a castoff people, we were supposed to fail, rather than create this enormously successful country. In that sense, as you would agree, we are a complete repudiation of Europe's allegiance to ancestry, pedigree, inherited capital, and class.    Europeans  :   Manifest Destiny, E pluribus unum, "your tired and poor"  we know it all well, the fons et origo of the world's blessings and so on. Recall that we are talking of tactics among friends in dealing rationally with common enemies, not philosophical issues of Locke versus Rousseau that have no relevance in the present crises other than to inflame and incite. What we need is joint consultation to tackle these growing problems in the Middle East and to pose a united front, along with the United Nations, in changing the behavior, albeit incrementally, of Iraq.    Americans  :  We wish it were only a matter of tactics or increments when 3,000 of our own were blown apart and a lunatic seems intent on acquiring gas and nukes. From your own past rhetoric it seems that you would prefer us to remove a democratically elected Sharon rather than a murderous tyrant like Hussein. And you seem less bothered by EU money in the hands of West Bank bombers than American aid supporting elected government.    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Exerpts were cheerfully taken from:  urlLink The European Dialogue .

I've got three  urlLink Phalaenopsis  orchids in lavender, white and fushia as well as one large white  urlLink Dendrobium  orchid. Well, I'm assuming I have three Phalaenopsis since my fushia orchid began as fushia for two years and then decided to grow white flowers as well. As far as I know they can't suddenly switch colors so...I'm thinking that somewhere along the line a white orchid seed got dropped in with the fushia.   Ahh, flowers. I love them. Anyone wanna buy me some? Maybe the person who visited from  urlLink Sun Bulb  can send me another orchid...LOL!  Well, I can dream.    ;)

In case you haven't been following, (I myself just got caught up on this!)  urlLink Jane  decided to try out the  urlLink Atkins diet  (in essence, it's a low-carbohydrate/high-protein diet). If you don't know about this diet plan, feel free to click on the link and look around their website. (A different opinion about the plan can be found here:  urlLink A Taste of the Atkins Diet .) Now, everyone who knows me or even just knows of me understands one fundamental fact about me: I LOVE MEAT. Based on this fact, you would think that such a program as the Atkins Diet was  made  for someone like me! I mean, come on! A diet where I can EAT MEAT ALL THE TIME?! How cool is that?  But, here's my problem with this program: it's a  diet . Who really wants to follow some book that tells you what you can and cannot eat? I surely don't. I'm fed up with diets; they're designed to fail if you don't follow them to the letter. When I was a child, I was put on so many diets, I can't even begin to tell you what half of them were; suffice to say that if it is out there, I've probably been on it. Sure they worked for me on the short term, but it boiled down to the fact that:   1.) When they actually started working, it was also at the stage of my life when I was  the most active . 2.) I never truly got rid of the fat, but my weight was ok.  Hindsight is always 20/20 -- I was at my best from about 15-18 years of age. During that time period I was involved in many different activities (sports, dance classes, etc) and I was at a healthy, decent weight of 120 because of it. Yet, I was still fat; sure, my weight was very good but I still had a fat rolls. As I look back on it, if I had the courage to go train at a gym and had taught myself to make better food choices I'd probably be a thin, healthy person now. Oh well. What actually happened was that I started slipping; I stopped most of my activities, my eating habits became progressively worse and I became more sedative. I graduated high school at 140 lbs. It wasn't  that  bad; had I caught it early I could have changed it. But then college hit me; my eating habits, bad as they alredy were, became horrendous. I kept making poor food choices and "pigged out" on anything and everything I wanted to eat. Depression hit for various reasons and caused more problems; I ate those nice things we call "comfort foods" in mass quantities. While everyone else kept joking about the "freshman fifteen", in my case it turned out to be the "freshman fifty". When all was said and done, by the end of my freshman year in 1999 I was an unhealthy 180 pounds. After that, for the two years following, my life took a strange shift in its road. Things that I'd rather not discuss now happened; suffice to say that by 2001, I weighed in at 250 lbs. I look at my 21st birthday pictures with a mixture of shame and pride; shame because of how fat I truly was and pride because that's what inspired me to start taking back my life.   I began to take baby steps into getting back towards a better style of living. I started to take inventory of what I was eating and decided that I could do without eating McDonald's every day of the goddamn week. Once I was able to break that habit, I started eating more normal foods. After that, I started limiting my intake on things like soda and replaced it with water and orange juice. I'd walk to school from the subway stop instead of waiting around for the shuttle bus. Like I said, baby steps...But those baby steps added up. I began seeing improvements in myself; I started losing weight and was feeling better. In October of 2001, I got a gift certificate for 4 free weight training sessions at a local gym. I took a chance and decided to go...And continue to do so even today. To date, those baby steps led to the loss of 60 pounds, a drop in pants-size from 38" to 34", an increase of strength and endurance, a decrease in my BMI, and much better food choices. Sure, I can mindlessly follow a book, but I would rather take an active role in deciding for myself as to what I do and do not want to eat. It doesn't take a genius to realize that a Super Sized #1 Combo Meal from McDonalds is much worse for your system than a home-made turkey sandwich with orange juice. So far, my "formula" has worked for me and continues to do so.   The thing is, once you get fat or overweight, you tend not to realize it until it starts to be a problem. You start realizing things like, "Hey, I feel winded just by climbing a set of stairs." Or, "Wow, I can't fit into my favorite pair of pants or any of my favorite dresses anymore." Once it hits you that you're overweight, you want a quick fix for the problem. After all, in this day and age where instant gratification is what is expected and everything is calibrated for ease of use, you  expect  to find an easy solution. And in this age of medical science, there's almost an expectation for a medical cure, a pill to combat this "disease". However, the problem did not occur overnight. Just as I spent three years putting time and effort into making myself fat and out of shape, it's going to take even more of my time and effort to make myself thin and healthy again. One year has seen 60 pounds drop from my frame; if I continue on this track, by this time next year I'll be down to 130. (I can only hope!) But it will take at least another year of sticking to my weight training regimen and making better food choices to get there. Another year of hard work and effort. I wish there was a magic pill I could swallow that would melt the fat away and make me healthy and beautiful in one day, but the cold, hard truth is...There is no magic pill. There is only me and my force of will that pushes me to go to the gym.   So, the Atkins diet isn't for me. I'm already following a pretty good guideline that, while it isn't perfect, has so far worked well for me. I've taken stock of myself and have decided on my on as to what I should and shouldn't eat and I think I'd rather follow my own common sense than follow a glorified book. If I feel like eating a filet mignon today, I'll eat salmon tomorrow. If I have a craving for McDonalds, I'll get it...but a small size, and I probably won't eat there for another month.  Everything in moderation.  There are no shortcuts.     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Something interesting I found on the web:  urlLink Better Ideal Body Weight Calculations . This does not only use the common, more widely-used Devine method but also includes some other methods (such as the "People's Choice" popular opinions on ideal weight) as well. Enjoy.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ UPDATE: 9/4/2002, 8:24AM ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Found another  urlLink Healthy Weight Indicator  via  urlLink Orchid ...

        Before I go...    Someone out there who's politically minded should compile a Dictionary of Political Labels so that the rest of us who have no clue can refer to it....  IF there's something like that already out there, someone let me know!!!   If not, I'll create one myself...LOL!    :)

        WHEE!    Today I went to the gym in... gym shorts . Yup, yesterday, while cleaning the house and doing laundry I found my old HS gym shorts, and to my huge surprise...THEY FIT! Awesome thing. The sun is shining brightly outside and I'm hella proud again;  this time   urlLink Nick 's been recognized by  urlLink WSJ's Best of the Web  today....Hell fuckin yea! *dances around*   :D    Also, I'm now addicted to Glenn Beck; he's one interesting individual and I find myself agreeing with him. This past Saturday, one of his main topics of discussion was the whole fiasco involving O+A -- He raised some good points. Yes, those two are pathetic, disgusting, vulgar (and a whole  slew  of other descriptive words) but they never would have become so famous and so popular if there wasn't such a  demand  for such idiocy. Personally, I listened to them for a week once; some people that I used to know were huge fans of the show and listened to it on the drive home from work religiously. Just by hearing their commentary on what happened on that day's "episode", I knew it was something I wouldn't like, but I figured I'd listen in and make my decision. Apparently I caught the "Best of O+A Week" and it just validated everything I already thought; just sick and wrong. Yeah, it took this "contest" to get pulled from the air...but...As Glenn pointed out, there's a  demand  for this sick shit and all the people who fanatically listened in will rally and cry out for more. It will only be a matter of time before they get re-hired by some no-name station trying to pay the bills; sad to think that this shit sells. I'd go on, but eh, Glenn said it better than I ever will on his show, and even  urlLink Nick  says it better (Damn him for beating me to it! LMAO). I'd just be repeating everything they said.   Maybe I'll write something better later, but...Right now the sun is shining splendidly outside my window and I feel the need to hop into my car and  drive .  And take more pictures for a rainy day...See ya all later!    :D

        Rain?    listen as the wind blows from across the great divide voices trapped in yearning, memories trapped in time the night is my companion, and solitude my guide would I spend forever here and not be satisfied?  and I would be the one to hold you down kiss you so hard I'll take your breath away and after, I'd wipe away the tears just close your eyes dear  through this world I've stumbled so many times betrayed trying to find an honest word to find the truth enslaved oh you speak to me in riddles and you speak to me in rhymes my body aches to breathe your breath your words keep me alive  And I would be the one to hold you down kiss you so hard I'll take your breath away and after, I'd wipe away the tears just close your eyes dear  into this night I wander it's morning that I dread another day of knowing of the path I fear to tread oh into the sea of waking dreams I follow without pride nothing stands between us here and I won't be denied  and I would be the one to hold you down kiss you so hard I'll take your breath away and after, I'd wipe away the tears just close your eyes...

        Yeap, I'm joining in.     urlLink 100 Things  About The Ravenwolf:  1.	I was born in a military hospital. 2.	I love to travel. (Yes, I still love planes). 3.	Commuting is fun; the joy of travel just kicks in. 4.	Car = Driving = Passion = Freedom. My car is a big part of my life; I love my car. 5.	Car = storage space/habitable space/sleep spaceWhen necessary. 6.	I hate Bahstun with a passion unbeknownst to most mortals. 7.	I hate the Bahstun accent as well(at least  my  NY accent is a respectable one) 8.	And their fucked up pronunciations of everyday normal words. 9.	Case in point: Peabody. Its PEA-BODY,  NOT FUCKING  PIHBUHDEE. 10.	Another one: Worcester. Say it like its spelled on the damn map. WORCE-STER,  not  WOOHSTAH. Bastards. I  despise  that.  11.	Something else that irks me is the misuse of the apostrophe-s, mainly for pluralization. Example: horse s , indicating many horses. Bastards. I just cant  stand  that. Grrrr. 12.	However, I happen to like Store 24: Mainly because they sell CoffeeMilk. 13.	HAHAHAHAHA! Lansdowne Street! God, that place holds so much amusementStupid eurotrash. Heh. 14.	Always have some sort of camera within arms reach. You never know when it will come in handy. 15.	I love dogs. Theres nothing like having a dog around.  16.	My favorite dogs include: Irish Wolfhounds, German Shepherds (especially the solid black ones), Alaskan Malamutes, Huskies, Akitas, Weimeraners, Spitzs, Australian Ridgebacksand of courseBlack Labradors.  17.	Cats are ok too, butnothing beats a dog. Nothing 18.	 The only cat Ive ever loved was my cat Snowy. She was one hell of a huntress and her sense of family/protection was insane. RIP Snowy: Im sure youre hunting those spiritual Canadian geese. Youre missed.  19.	Still not used to my SuPeRvIsIoN (20/15 baybee!) but Im getting there. 20.	Still forget to take off my sunglasses while insideHeh. 21.	Im a lucid dreamer, deep dreamer, and sometime daydreamer 22.	 Always seem to have a set of twins in my life no matter what stage of my life you look at.  23.	I love Corvids and Raptors. Ravens, Red-tailed Hawks, Peregrine Falcons, OspreyThey fascinate me. Maybe one day Ill be able to get into falconry 24.	Pigeons get to me. I feel the unexplainable urge to kick every time I see one. 25.	Nassau County should just be obliterated. All we need is a nice bridge connecting Suffolk Country to Queens.  26.            I now have a Queens/Brooklyn-ish accent when I get angry. This is interesting... 27.	When traveling, I love the subconscious reactions I get from people when I tell them I'm from NY. It amuses me. 28.	The most mundane things can and will become collectible items in my hands.  29.	There is just something magical about the night; especially underneath the full moon. 30.	Twilight, however, is my time; whether its night twilight or dawn twilight, its my time.  31.	The nighttime beach/shoreline is where I belong.  32.	Wintertime is my time. 33.	I favor cold weather: nothing like driving down the road during winter with the windows down 34.	Theres just something about driving with the windows downPeriod.  35.	Coffee is life. Its dangerous for me to have too much blood in my coffeestream 36.	Chai is also another one of my addictions. Whether it is served hot, over ice, or frozen, its just damn good. 37.	Borders is a great place. I love the fact that I can get some coffee or chai, grab a book, sit down and read and no one will say a damn thing to me.  38.	Its all about the Pisces-Aries cusp. I happen to be more Piscean in nature, but trust me, there are times where the Aries in me takes over.  39.	Maternal instinct? HAH. HAHAHAHAHA! I laugh in the face of maternal instinct! Its been repressed for so long I have no idea whats going to happen when I have kids.  40.	Yet, mark my words. I will have a daughter, one day. With her exceptional intelligence (and beauty, of course) she will wreak havoc on the worldWhen that day comes, lock your  precious  sons up, mommies; thats about all the warning Ill ever give you. >:) 41.	 I rather like being the Alpha Female. 42.	No apologies, no regrets. The past is past and the future is unknown; now is all we truly have.  43.	The only constant is change, but sometimes you can change by being constant.  44.	Watership Down has been my favorite book since I was 5 years old. 45.	Trent ReznorWow. Something I Can Never Have is still a song that can make me cry. Sin does other things 46.	Trent is someone Id  love  to meet. However, I know myself too well; Id get close to him, manage to stammer a hello and then withdraw into my shy nature. Too bad though 47.	Shaved heads are great to rub. (Get your mind out of that damn gutter. Heh.) 48.	Music is life. Whether its on the radio, in my head, or being played by my handsMusic is life.  49.	Dancing. Ill do it whenever I feel the need. I dont give a shit if you dont like my dancing, I dont care if Im in public. If the rhythm touches my soul, Im gonna dance.  50.	Ill say whats on my mind. It might take a little while for me to prepare myself to say it, but rest assured, youll hear it. 51.	If I dont like you, youll know. Trust me, youll know where we stand. 52.	Dont fuck with me. Dont fuck with my family. Dont fuck with my loved ones. Dont fuck with my friends. Dont fuck with my dog. Trust me, its in  your best interests   not to . 53.	Life is nothing but a long string of hellos and goodbyes. However, its what you do with the time in between each hello and goodbye that truly matters.  54.	Death? Death is only a shift in the road of life.  55.	I have many animal guides. Born with Jaguars blessing. Raised with Wolf and Raven. (Hence the name.) Falcon and Hawk watch over me. Bear checks in from time to time 56.	I want the abilities of: shapeshifting, telepathy, telekinesis, and teleportation. 57.	Ill probably be the first in line for cybernetics. 58.	I wish I had blue, green or hazel eyes instead of these boring dark brown ones. 59.	I love salmon. Absolutely LOVE it; preferably baked or grilled.  60.	Meat is delicious and I LOVE steak. Preferably filet mignon.  61.	I loooove Militant Vegans...preferably Medium Rare, smothered in A-1 sauce with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and spinach. Oh! Don't forget the sourdough dinner rolls, and I like bleu cheese dressing on my salad. Heh. 62.            I will try almost any strange food once. Ive eaten black bear, boar, emu, ostrich, alligatorAll were pretty good except for the bear; too stringy, tough meat and it broke its winter fast on fish (which tainted the meat). Ugh.  63.            I absolutely  hate  spicy foods. Cant stand Indian/Arabian restaurants. Also, I WILL NOT go near Chinese/Asian food places. Just the  smell  emanating from such eateries  alone  triggers nausea and the gag reflex. 64.	I am the very definition of a packrat. I've got more stuff than I have space for... 65.	Something about guys in fatiguesMMMmmm. Its all about the camouflage and the combat boots.  66.	Its all about boots in general. Especially steel-toed and steel-heeled. (All the better to kick you with, asshole.) 67.	I never knew the definition of Road Rage until I hit Nassau County and had to drive through morning traffic on the LIE. (Overheard: Nassau County traffic can make The Pope say GODDAMNIT!) 68.	Guns. Love them. Want many. Nuff said. 69.	Yes, I know how to shoot and I love it. I just need time to go down to the gun rangeHowever, I would not hunt with such weaponry. Id use bow, arrow, spear and knife. 70.            I expect respect. I respect you and yours and I expect the same in return. Do not touch/insult/claim what is mine because I  will  retaliate. 71.	Racing. Whether its stock or rally cars, I dont give a damn. Im addicted.  72.	When I was younger I wanted to be a Demolition Derby driver 73.	And I still havent given up hope to be a racer. 74.	If I see another tricked out Honda Civic, Im going to run over its owner.  75.	If I see another tricked out cheesy car that really  shouldnt be  (like, oh, saya Dodge Neon) Im going to run over its owner. 76.	Motorcycles are nifty; wish I had the funds to get one and the guts to ride it.  77.	Muscle cars and classic cars are simply beautiful, especially old skool Mustangs (preferably within the 1964½-1969 year range with a few notable exceptions).  78.	I want to learn mechanics in order to take better care of my car. I hate the feeling of knowing that something is slightly off in her (because Ive had her for so long I just  know  when somethings not quite right) and not being able to pinpoint it for the shop. Grrr. 79.	Naturally black haired people rule, as well as any people with naturally occuring darker shades of hair AND redheads. We just rule.  80.	Platinum blondes irk me. 81.	However, Black/dark-haired people who ruin their beautiful hair in order to dye it platinum blondeAngerRisingMust...Restrain...Fist...Of...Death...  82.	Peoples eyes fascinate me. I could stare into them for hours on end and never get bored. 83.	People-watching is a wonderful pastime. 84.	I am the resident psychologist. Yes, the doctor is IN and has been since 1987. 85.	One day I will get to Ireland, Scotland, Australia and New Zealand. 86.	One Winter Solstice I will stand in Stonehenge. 87.	Black and silver are key - As well as the deep, dark purples, reds, greens and blues. Also, the pastels of those darker colors are acceptable.  88.            One day I'll find all the Ugly Ducklings and help them all realize that they're Swans. 89.	Talk radio is addicting, especially 1010 WINS and 770WABC. 90.	Un dia, voy a regresar en mi pais y encontrar que estoy constanamente buscando 91.	On the points where it matters, I am on good terms with myself. Im comfortable in my skin.  92.	I know and acknowledge my flaws, faults, fears and weaknesses. 93.	No, I will not tell you what they are.  94.	I may not remember your name, but I will remember your face as well as every time you have slighted me, cheated me, messed with me, said something to me, and generally fucked me over.  95.	If you have betrayed me, I will remember this forever. Your words will always be lies until they are proven true by someone I trust completely. Your actions will be watched closely by those I consider family and you will not know you are being observed. Your motives will always be suspicious to me and I will question it frequently. You will have to work that much harder to prove yourself to me...and even  then  a second chance is not guaranteed. Sorry, I'm not God.  96.	I listen to my Guarani blood.  97.	Demon to some, angel to others. I rather like that; sounds like me. 98.	I will never, ever cut my hair short again. 99.	One day you will see the beauty that I see in the monstrosities and pariahs that you helped create and now abhor. 100.          Very few people  truly  know me. The rest of you never will.    Excellence. >:)

        I have returned    From the hunt and I now have a dress! WOOO!! Excellence. I also have a migraine that I need to sleep off and I can feel the tension of locked up rage and frustration from all that hassle.  Grrrr.  Anyway, what I really wanted to say was...As I was driving home with my mom, it was raining and generally not-pleasant driving weather. However, it  wasn't  a thunderstorm, just normal rain. Suddenly, we saw three bright blue flashes illuminating the clouds; at first we thought it was lightning, but normally when lightning flashes it illuminates the clouds with white light and flashes randomly over a long period of time. This was bright blue, flashing in almost rapid succession and only three times.   Weird.  Any ideas as to what could have caused that?

        Thinking...    I've been mulling over these different thoughts in my brain for a little while now and I feel that it's time to put them out there...  I unfortunately missed the President's speech this week due to a small case of  class , and (of course) no one at home taped it for me. Then they told me why; by the time the found a station playing the speech, it was already over. They saw the snippets during the 11 o' clock news. I pondered this, but because it was past midnight, I just wanted to go to sleep. Then I found out why; everyone all over 770 was going off on the major networks (CBS, NBC, ABC) for  not covering the President's speech . I thought to myself...Waaaait a minute here...WHAT!? The President gives a speech and the major netorks  don't  cover it!? Who made this decision? What kind of crack are these executives on!? This is outragous! I forget who gave out all the stats between the people who watched the normal programming and those who watched the speech (I  believe  it was Rush, but I could be mistaken...) but a formidable 17 million people watched the speech. Probably more would have watched if they knew which networks to tune into. I hope those executives figure out that "Fear Factor" isn't as important as a speech by the President, even if it isn't labled "super important". After all, it was only 20 minutes long; I don't see why they couldn't devote 20 minutes of time  for the goddamn President!!!   Weirdness.  As for the shootings going on? Insanity. The only thing I have a problem with is the fact that everyone's touting the fact that the shooter has been trained as a sharpshooter. Maybe so, but not because of the precision of shots. I would say that the methodical nature of cleanup and targets chosen points more to this than precision of shot; after all, with a powerful, well-calibrated scope attached to a rifle  anyone  can shoot with precision.  Just my take on it.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤      LMAO !!!   Go figure, the only call I get on my cell phone today is a  wrong number ...Heh. Sometimes I wonder why I still have this thing; at least I'm locked into a good plan so the cost of keeping it around is negligable...Ah well.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤      At least Afterblur Radio is playing Basement Jaxx: "Where's Your Head At" so I can  dance  WOOO!!!   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤      I'm freaking out over going to my friend's wedding this Sunday. Thankfully I'm not in any of the important groups but I'm still freaking out. I have nothing formal enough to wear to a wedding and so I've been running around looking for a dress. This is both fucking great and fucking depressing...  * Great because instead of a size 22, I'm down to a 16-variable. (WHEE!)  * Depressing because I am a  16  and I remember when I was a  9 . Grrrr.   Why variable? Because each dress company seems to have different ideas as to what a size 16 should be. It's like this: ~~ Dress Comany A's size 16 fits well. (Joy!  It's just...waaaaaaaay too formal. Damn.) ~~ Dress Company B's size 16 is as large as a size 20. (Damn. It was pretty too.) ~~ Dress Company C's size 16 should be re-labeled 12. (Fuckers, I hate you.)  And so, I'm on the hunt for a nice looking dress at a size 16-variable. Blaargh. It's always like this: I scour each store for the right sizes...When I finally find something, I visit Hell for a while -- Why is the fitting room Hell? Because you have to lock yourself in a small stall that has the Corner of Shame. Yes, in one corner of the stall there's a brace of 3 mirrors in which you can see yourself at every angle and...God...it just sucks. I keep repeating my mantra everytime I walk in -- "There's an improvement, these things take time, there's an improvement, you put hard work into becoming a lardass, it's gonna take more hard work to become yourself again, you're not 250 anymore, you're not a size 20 anymore, there's an improvement..."  By the time I've tried on everything, nothing fits correctly and I'm depressed. (It's either a large expanse of fabric hanging off of me and dragging on the floor because apparently women who are size 16s only come in 5'7" and above --OR-- the thing is so damn tight I look like an over-cooked salchicha. Bleh.)   Fuuuuuuck. This is a painful process. Very painful. If anyone tells you that losing weight is easy, they're lying to your face. Trust me. Once I get back to myself, remind me to never get fat again. This shit sucks!!! Heh.   Anyway.  After talking about the hunt, I'm being  yelled at  gently reminded by my mother that  you don't want to go naked do you  I need to find a dress and that  there's no time to find one  I have time to find one.  Blaargh. Just blaargh.    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    I can't believe it!!!   urlLink Tannin Schwarzstein  herself stopped by and left me comments!!! AAAAHH!!!!  Damn that's awesome. How did you find me?    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Oh and before I go:   Heya fellow Corvus Corax lovers stopping by from  urlLink Chronicle Corvidae ! Welcome!

         urlLink Yet again...      1. If you could only choose 1 cd to ever listen to again, what would it be?  Damn. That's tough; it's between  urlLink Pretty Hate Machine  or  urlLink Broken ...Very difficult as both are near and dear to my heart. PHM because that holds my all-time favorite songs..."Something I Can Never Have" still brings me to tears; it was the song that, at the time I first heard it, completely encompassed everything for me and I connected deeply with it. "Sin" did... other things ...Broken, however is the CD that I return to whenever my violent tendencies need to break out.  Tough. I'd have to go with Pretty Hate Machine though; so much raw emotion, memory and soul has been put into it, I have to go with it.   2. If you could only choose 2 movies to watch ever again, what would they be?   urlLink The Crow   urlLink The Terminator    3. If you could only choose 3 books to read ever again, what would they be?  *  urlLink The Wolf and the Raven  (Diana L. Paxton) *  urlLink Kushiel's Chosen  (Jacqueline Carey) *  urlLink Wizard and Glass  (Stephen King) ----------> This is, of course, taken into account the fact that J. O'Barr's  urlLink The Crow  is a  given . That graphic novel has been with me for a long time and it still speaks volumes to me.    4. If you could only choose 4 things to eat or drink ever again, what would they be?  Meat. Chocolate. Coffee. Chai.   5. If you could only choose 5 people to ever be/talk/associate/whatever with ever again, who would they be?   Nick...Definately Nick. Why? I could write out every reason why, but it wouldn't be enough.  You just wouldn't understand.  There are still some things in life that you just have to  feel  in order to understand; trust me.        As for the other 4? I'd say...Glenn,  Paul , Thomas and Eckels. (NOT THAT THE REST OF YOU AREN'T IMPORTANT!!!!!   EEP!  I'd definately find a way to talk to everyone...Somehow...)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Daaaaaaamn, that was a tough one; interesting though. I feel bad because it's so  limiting ; it's hard to narrow everything down. Crazy. Thankfully, these are only hypothetical (rhetorical?) questions...  *phew*    :)

        Hopefully later...    I'll post something more meaningful than the Friday Five questionnaire, but...I'm currently reading Book #4 in a series that I just can't seem to put down..  At this point, I don't give a damn what happens once the group of characters reaches their final destination; I just want to hear more of the main character's history...Heh. Few books (and  only four series which are chronicled below) have  ever  drawn me in, so I'm overjoyed and fascinated.   Four series of books prior to this one that have had this effect on me are as follows: Diana Paxton's "Wodan's Children" trilogy: 1.)  urlLink The Wolf and the Raven  2.)  urlLink The Dragons of the Rhine  3.)  urlLink The Lord of Horses   Alice Borchardt's "Wolf" series: 1.)  urlLink The Silver Wolf  2.)  urlLink Night of the Wolf  3.)  urlLink The Wolf King   Julliet Marillier's "Sevenwaters Trilogy":  1.)  urlLink Daughter of the Forest  2.)  urlLink Son of the Shadows  3.)  urlLink The Child of Prophesy   Jacqueline Carey's "Kushiel" series (for lack of a better term): 1.)  urlLink Kushiel's Dart  2.)  urlLink Kushiel's Chosen  3.) Next in the series is forthcoming...   See you later...

         urlLink On time...for once...      1. What size shoe do you wear?  Depends on the shoe. Anywhere from 81/2 (wide) - 9/2 (normal) in women's sizes...61/2-71/2 in men's.    2. How many pairs of shoes do you own?  Surprisingly not that many. (I'm trying to stay far, far away from this kinda stuff...Shoe affliction, from what I have observed is highly contagious and my mother seems to suffer from this. I understand the  why , but...I'm still not taking any chances.) Currently I own: a pair of huge comfy flipflops, a pair of dressy-like sandals and 3 pairs of dressy shoes.   3. What type of shoe do you prefer (boots, sneakers, pumps, etc.)?   Personally, I'd rather run around barefoot. It's nice, comfortable -- None of those damn restrictions on my wide feet and none of that toe cramping (damn that extra-long toe!). But if I have to wear shoes, it's one of three pairs (depending on where I'm going and what I'm doing):  either my steel-toed boots (yeap, still a big part of my life), my sneakers (all that damn city walking, lol) or my sandals (all the better to quickly be barefoot with...and yet still have shoes).    4. Describe your favorite pair of shoes. Why are they your favorite?  My old 20-eyelet steel toed Docs with the spikes and the worn out laces. Why? Because they've been with me for a loooong time.   5. What's the most you've spent on one pair of shoes?  $120 for my pair of 20-eyelet steel-toed Grinders that are now 5 years old. I believe it was a good investment.   *One last thing: Am I the only one who considers "boots", "sneakers", and "shoes" to be different categories?  Hrrrm.     :)

(MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! ...*coughcough, regain composure*)  Right. So, go over there and congratulate him. After all, he has good taste in Goddesses.    ; D

Because after making some small adjustments to my own template, Blogger decided it didn't like my changes and figured it would only post the blog-window.     Joy.    So now I'm going to try to fix this shit up. GODDAMNIT!!!!!   Never  a dull fucking moment.  GOD MAKE THIS MOVABLE TYPE SHIT WORK!!! I'M FED UP WITH THIS CRAP!!!!!

It's fun, but I'm still a chess newbie so I guess it's just  that  much more fun for me! (How can you go wrong with 2 new awesome looking pieces called the Wizard and the Champion?? You just  can't .) Then you have experts like  urlLink Pej , who already beat the game.  LOL! Oh well. I'm still learning and insomnia is a great helper...    : )

        OK...    Maybe I'm just not "cool" enough to understand...What was the big deal with  urlLink CBS's Victoria's Secret  fashion show? For the past couple of days all I've been hearing on the radio are the reports of women's groups and whatever other groups protesting it and whatnot.   WHAT?!   WHAT?!    I guess I'm just blasé about the whole deal; I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In fact, I'm kinda miffed that CBS aired it on a  WEDNESDAY ,  precisely  the day that I have class from 6-9. (Bastards! You couldn't wait until the  weekend !?)       I don't know. I can see how if you aren't happy with your body, this just seems to serve as a detrimental reinforcement to you that you will never attain perfection. In all honesty, that would be my immediate, knee-jerk reaction to this whole thing; normally, I would view it as an ordeal and it would toss me into a severe depression within 0.2 seconds. Now, I look at it differently. It's not that I'm completely happy with my  body  (God  knows  I need more work)  but I'm getting there. (Slowly but surely, it's happening. After all, I can wear  chickpants  now!!!  WOO!!!  LOL, okokok I'll stop obsessing over the pants now.) It's more like I'm truly comfortable in my skin and more accepting of myself. Aye, I'm still overly-fleshy, but on the whole I'm happy with my self . Therein lies the difference. I'm not going to lie though; I'm still envious of these models with their perfect bodies, but eh, such is life. I'm still happy. (Except for the fact that I missed the new fall lineup of stuff that's coming in...Grrr. That makes me angry.)   Maybe my South American nature is coming to the forefront; this whole attitude of, "Who gives a shit? I'm still fucking  fabulous  and you  better  recognize!!!" *shrug* Whatever. I'm not going to question it, I'm just going to accept it and move on.    :)    Victoria's Secret. Who knew? I actually love their stuff, even though I can't buy half of what they sell. The stuff I can buy, however, I do. (Except for those wings -- ARRGH!!! I  want  them, but they always tell me that they're not for sale.  GRRRR.  If any of you out there in Internetland ever want to get on my good side, feel free to buy and mail me a pair of Victoria's Secret wings!!! WOO!) And that's another thing; I missed all the new style wings! Grrr. Anyway. Getting back to my point...  If you know that watching something like the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will depress you beyond all recognition, don't watch it. Grab the remote and click on over to another channel. Or even better, turn off the TV and take a walk or go to the gym. But don't protest the airing of the show and try to ruin it for the rest of us who actually DO want to watch it. Honestly? I wanted to see the new fasions and patterns and wings.  * * * Too Much Info Alert --  urlLink Click down  to the end of my post now if you don't want to be screaming "TMI!! TMI!!" * * * You might want to  urlLink click down now . I might scare you by discussing thongs...  * * * You sure you want to continue?  urlLink Last chance...  * * * OK, you were warned. Don't blame me if you get disgusted. After all, it's my damn blog.  * * *  ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤  Hell yeah I support Victoria's Secret; their underwear is beautiful, well-made and comfortable to wear. Even though half of their stuff I can't buy (Bastards!!! Would it KILL you to make bras in a D-cup?? Grrr.) what I do own is just awesome.  **Note:***  For the women out there who don't ordinarily buy VC stuff, walk in, try something on and get it. Even if you absolutely hate your body, you'd be surprised just how much better you feel about it just by buying something beautiful to adorn yourself with. Sound stupid? Maybe. But if you can garner up the courage to walk in there and buy something, you've just made your first step into learning to accept yourself and love yourself for who you are. At the least, that was  my  first step. (I blame it on a faulty synapse somewhere that jump-started my confidence into screaming, "Who gives a shit? I'm still fucking fabulous and you better fucking recognize this fact!!! I'm gonna walk into this stupid store and buy something pretty. Fuck you all for staring at me, cuz I don't give a flying fuck about you all. It's about  me  dammit,  ME!!! " It was a false courage that gave way into real courage After the 4th or 5th time of walking in and buying stuff, it became old hat and it's not that big of a deal walking into the store. Heh. Go fig.)   I remember a long time ago (when Lynn Samuels was still on 770) Lynn just couldn't understand what the deal was with thongs. In fact, she dedicated almost half of her show to the discussion of thongs: "Aren't they uncomfortable? How do you get used to them?" She was baffled. I used to not understand either until the day I walked in, bought some, took them home, washed them, and wore them. It makes me wonder how the hell I ever dealt with "normal" underwear in the first place. They're actually more comfortable than normal underwear, especially when wearing pants. Thought to ponder: What's more uncomfortable? A.) wearing a thong OR  B.) Having normal underwear bunch up into a wedgie? My answer is A because B just  sucks . I have no qualms about wearing them either, even though I'm in no position to "rock" said thongs. There's no way in hell I'll wear only a thong out in public. Then again that's why it's called  under wear. You don't see them, I'm happily comfortable and all is well with the world. Even if you don't have a supermodel's body, it doesn't matter,  you too  can still wear a thong! If it fits you and you're comfortable, who gives a shit? After all, it's for  you . Fuck it. Unless you  are  a supermodel and it's your job to flaunt your underwear down the runway, then in reality, you're wearing your underwear for yourself. Like I said before, it's called  under wear. As long as you're comfortable, who cares?  Eh, maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just rambling on and only this is making sense to  me . I'll just continue on with the rest of this rant.  ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    I don't know.  I guess VC is an easy target. After all, they're degrading women. (Horrors!) Yeah, right. You want to see the degredation of women? Go over to the Middle East and take notes. These VC models are women who are  obviously  beautiful and what's more, they  know  they are. What, you're going to tell me that they  don't  revel in being in a business that depends on beauty and near-perfection? You're going to tell me that they  don't  know what their business entails? That they were  forced  into the business? I'll laugh in your face: HAHAHAHAHA! Yeah, ok. Keep deluding yourself. They know how beautiful they are, but modeling is still a job. (Of course, it's a job that many of women wish they could have, but after seeing the amount of shit they go through to continue to be in the business, they can HAVE it. It's a cut-throat business; once you've past your prime, no one wants you, and sadly, your "prime timeframe" is very, very short.) If they enjoy it, it's not exactly degrading, now is it? If they are given respect for survivng such a business and honored for their beauty, that's not exactly degrading either now, is it? So maybe men are ogling them on the TV. Hell, isn't that what heterosexual men are  supposed  to do? After all, these are some truly beautiful women wearing beautiful underwear. Oh, the humiliation! They'd see the same thing in Maxim or Stuff, only now it's in realtime (with wings added).   Maybe those who are protesting are just jealous. After all, it stands to reason that if they can't handle seeing supermodels doing what they're paid to do  and actually enjoying it , then they can't wear what the models are wearing. That I understand. A part of me wants to hate them, rile against them and scream an endless stream of obscenities at them for being beautiful...But what good would  that  do? At the end, I'd have a sore throat and still be in my skin. Like I'm sure all those protesters have as well. I wonder if it made them feel any better after they were done. Probably not, because at the end they're still left with nothing but themselves as well. Better to save the hate for something that truly deserves it and learn to love what I have.   For the rest of us it might be considered degrading; after all, we  all  can't be born supermodels. Eh, whatever. So what? Keep your supermodel status. I'm happy that I can now wear chickpants. Just gimme your wings and I'll call it even.    : )

        Oh yeah    Last things before I go nap:  To you who came here looking for "nude Asparagirl pictures" -- Sorry dude (or chick), I have some pictures of her from the blogparties but NONE of them are nude. Go ask the same question of  urlLink this guy  and see what happens. I'll notify your next of kin, I promise.  For you who came here wondering "what do ravens eat?" -- Well, mostly carrion (a nicer way of saying corpses -- dead things). If you want more information, go  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here . Feel free to do a search on "corvus corax" (the scientific name for the common raven) -- that  should  cut down on the unrelated links.   HEY to everyone coming here from  urlLink Whacking Day  -- The post you want is  urlLink here  (responding to  urlLink this post ).  If you decide you want to read the rest of my posts, you can also find links to it up in my NavBar.   I think that's it for now...See you all later.

        So...    Wednesday night, all my male friends were suddenly...occupied. No one was too be found; mysteriously, everyone had something to do. (Damn CBS for airing the Victoria's Secret fall preview on a goddamn wednesday night.  I  missed  it.  Bastards. Heh.)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   So who of my fellow  urlLink WABC 770  addicts caught  urlLink Hannity 's show on wed. afternoon? HAH!  "Caller Ed" made my day as I was driving in to school. Sad, sad, sad. The 10 year old kid who called up and screamed in Hannity's defense had more to say than that guy did. IF that's the prime example of a "Liberal Democrat", then...just...Wow. Please excuse me while I go talk to Michael Savage. I'd rather align myself politically with  him  than "Caller Ed". That whole episode was ridiculous! Amusing, yes, but still utterly ridiculous. Hah, I'm so glad I had my voice recorder on me. Now I can rewind it, listen to the childish outbusts and laugh my ass off. No wonder why they lost. *shrug*   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Anyway, anyone else notice that Richard Bey is ready to fly off the handle at any given moment? (As in,  MORE  than usual...) It gets to the point where I have to just turn off talk radio and listen to K-Rock for awhile just to clear the Bey-induced headache I get. He yells too much; I wonder if he realizes that  no , you cannot prove that you are correct just by yelling louder than the next guy (whether it's a caller or Steve). All you prove is that you were born with a strong set of lungs and a large heaping of self-importance. What, you want to hear your own voice? Stay home, close your eyes and talk to yourself. Blaargh. No, you're not bitter, not at all.   :P~~~     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Moveable Type  still  isn't working. It's frustrating me to the point where I think I'm going to drop-kick this goddamn computer. Grrr.    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Can anyone explain to me why Michael Jackson has kids? I mean,  look at him . Would  YOU  trust that strange freak of nature with children!? It's obvious he's unfit to have them; he can't even take care of himself. And what the hell was that bullshit of dangling that baby over the ledge!? (Which all the articles list as  his son . This begs the question: What woman in her right mind allowed herself to be impregnated with that  thing 's child?) Am I the only one who sees the insanity in that statement?! (No link provided, being that all of you are probably sick of seeing links to it already.)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   And what the hell was up with  urlLink Daschle blaming Limbaugh  for getting people to threaten him? Strange, that. If he and his family were truly in any immediate danger, why didn't he call up 911? Hel lo , it's called common sense. Get some.   :P~~~     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Why   yes  , I  am  feeling venomous today. Why do you ask? Is it that obvious?   ; )   Heh.  Yeah, it's been an interesting day. (Thursday, I mean.) Started out with me shifting into psychological gear early in the mornin; that was joyful. Not for nothing, but, man, I didn't have  time  to answer your rhetorical questions about my brother. I've got shit to do, like  go to class . YES, unlike YOU, my school runs on trimesters. MEANING THAT UNLIKE YOU, I'M NOT ON BREAK. Either way, I'm  not  the person you should be talking to. You want answers? Ask  him  these questions. I don't  know  why he did what he did, leave me alone. I HAD SHIT TO DO!!! I fucking missed my train because of your shit. I MISSED MY GODDAMN TRAIN! ARRRRGH!!!! What the fuck!? Why do  I  need to fucking stop my life and miss my responsibilities in order to try to hold your hand and make you feel good about yourself? It's not  my fault  he left you. If he's happy now that he's free, I'm not going to begrudge him. It's his life, and if he decided that you're not a part of it, then, what do you want me to do? Wave my hand around, weave some magick and drag his ass back to you? Sorry, but even if I had that kind of power I wouldn't do that. It's his life and his decision, take it up with him. I'm tired. I've got shit to do. I have my life to live and other responsibilities. My loyalties are strong towards my family, but you're not family. Sorry if that hurts, but you're not family.   Not that I'm not willing to help. I actually  like  helping people. (No really, I do.) IT's just that yeah, I wanted to help you but I had to go and you obligated me the moment you started talking about it.   It's just so goddamn  FRUSTRATING  when I have to do other shit and I feel like I'm being pulled apart in every goddamn fucking direction.   Just next time, write me an email or something so I can respond when I have the time to so I don't have to be late for class.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Yeah. Just yeah. I'm going to sleep.   Fuck this shit. I'm tired.    >:P

        Pissed off    Last night, I scanned in all of my BlogSummit pictures; sized them all properly and saved them to a disk. Somehow, in the process of walking from one room to the other (maybe a distance of, oh, 10 feet!?) I lost the damn disk. HOW!? I guess the 3AM gremlins wanted it more than I did. Grrrr.  Oh, and MovableType is annoying the goddamn hell out of me. Go fucking figure, it uploaded and set up perfectly on the webhost that doesn't support MySQL -- But on the goddamn ones that CAN, it doesn't fucking work.   Oh yeah, and my fucking alarm clock didn't goddamn ring, so I'm late for fucking class. It's pretty much guaranteed that I'm gonna miss my Systems Analysis class today -- It starts at 2 and the last train I can catch and be  moderately  on time is the 12:10 train.   It's 12 fucking 30.   Today is not my goddamned day.  Grrrrrr....

         WHAT  Torrential Downpour!?    When it's that time to get together, drink, discuss life and have fun, not even a torrential downpour can stop bloggers from doing so!  :D  Most of the usuals came to the International Blogger Summit (a.k.a. BloggerBash5 -- Hey  urlLink Doc  and  urlLink Clay  -- You were both missed!) and some new faces were "imported" for the event. I met my " urlLink quiz-result-namesake " --  urlLink Tom Paine  --  urlLink Sasha's right ; he really  does  look pretty good for a 267-year old! I thought he was very interesting to talk to, and I hope that I didn't bore him too much in the beginning there.  urlLink Scott  came up from Delaware and  urlLink Benjamin  came down from New Hampshire for the event; from their respective reports it looks like they both enjoyed themselves. (Make sure you guys come back for the next one!) Andrew, you were well met and you truly lived up to your "rocker look" (However, I'd like to know how the hell you managed to pull that off in an "opera bar" -- Tell me your secret!) I'm patiently waiting for the  urlLink Atheist  to send me pictures; if you happen to decide that you don't like your camera, I'll be more than happy to take it off of your hands!  urlLink Aaron , thanks for the good conversations and also for watching my stuff when I needed to wander off for a bit -- I hope you don't regret ever promising to help me out with any problems I might encounter with my databases!  urlLink Asp , one of these days I'm going to hold you to your word and we'll go see Thoroughly Modern Millie.  urlLink Jane ? Next time I'm going to toss out the person sitting in the seat next to you so we can actually  talk ! LOL, I guess I'll have to resort to violence in order to get this done.  urlLink Paul , next time we'll sing karaoke.  urlLink Ken , as always, you make any party great -- I hope you find the right woman to take to Akron, OH. ; )  And  urlLink Sasha  -- Awesome party, great place; what more can I say? Congrats on a party well-planned! :D   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   OK, I know it's been a while since I've updated, but I got frustrated after Blogger decided to eat posts. (Of course, I was tired and forgot to do my usual copy/paste backup...Grrr! HATE it when that happens!) Soooo...Let the rundown begin!   urlLink OF COURSE I SIGNED.  I'm that dead serious about it. But the question remains... urlLink Won't you?    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   WOO!   WOOOOOO!!!!   It's ALL about  urlLink H & M !  I absolutely love this store when I have to get "normal"-like clothing. Just recently I bought chick pants  that actually fit me . Honestly? I don't think I've  ever  worn chick pants  in my life . All of my pants are guys sizes, (now 36), so this is a brand new thing for me. It's strange to wear pants whose bottoms are actually a "normal" size instead of my normal, baggy, comfortable huge 69" at the bottoms. AND the fact that they're chick pants, scares me yet makes my day at the same time. WOO! I'm moving up in the world! The other thing I got recently is this long black sweater/coat combo thing. It's big, it's warm and supremely comfortable. (Those who were at the International Blog Summit saw these two new articles of clothing. Sorry if I was really being annoying about it, but truly, I really was that hyped up about these new things!)   Yeah,  urlLink H & M  is pretty much the store I shop at for clothes now. Scary.   I promise I won't turn in to a girly-girl any time soon. This I  promise  swear. No girly-girl Ravenwolf!   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Movable Type has been interesting to deal with. My original webhost decided to screw with me -- One person told me that  yes , they  did  support SQL, but after I installed it, tried to make it work, got that insane error message (thanks for your help  urlLink Lady Raven  -- and also thanks to  urlLink Mike for his heads up as to what type of error it was -- That helped immensely!), uninstalled it, reinstalled it, and then gave up and sent more emails all around ...I finally get a  true  response and find out that...Hey look! No they  don't  support SQL.  JOY.  So I'm trying to make it work on my new host. Keep your fingers crossed, please....!   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   On a completely random note, does anyone else find  urlLink this slightly disturbing ? (No, it's not the picture of Michael Jackson -- I'm sure that we can all agree on the fact that THAT picture is VERY disturbing.)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   I'm pondering helping the  urlLink Nasty Bastard  out; he  urlLink wants pictures  of other bloggers in order to make the top heading/logo on his blog. (To see what I'm talking about, go to  urlLink his main page  and hit refresh a couple of times...He's already gotten a few submissions.)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Ah yes. I finally saw  urlLink 8 Mile ...And I was actually impressed with Eminem's work. (Scary, I know,  me  actually liking and being impressed by Eminem. No, I don't think this will go further than this movie and that one song that came out of this movie.) From the here-say, parts of it supposedly mirror his own life, so I guess he'd be perfect in the role to begin with. (And if that's true, then...Damn. Suddenly you can understand why the man is the way he is. No one should go through that type of shit. Unless, of course, they were my worst enemy and even then I'd hesitate wishing that on them.) Crazy.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   "BICYCLE RACE!!!"   (Evo, I'm going to kill you if you don't deliver that amv soon.)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   WOO! I now have Photoshop 7!! I'm so excited I can't wait to install it. Hell yeah!    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Alright, I think it's time to crash now. It's about 3:30 AM and I started this post loooong ago; my eyeballs are dry and hurting and they need to drink in some  urlLink Refresh Celluvisc .  Nitey nite all!    :D

        Joy...    Got tired of looking at both the grinning Black Spiral Dancer graphic as well as the Hawk picture...But that doesn't mean you guys are off the hook to   VOTE FOR ARROGANT RANTS   in  urlLink DailyPundit's Poll !!! COME ON GUYS!!!!   VOTE NOW!!!!    Oh, and a note to all my AOLers out there:  Do me a favor and add  urlLink DailyPundit  to your Favorite Places and  vote every time you log on ! You get a new and different IP address every time you sign on so...DO IT!!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?  It would make me very happy indeed if you all pulled together to help  urlLink Nick  win this poll!    :D     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ HOUSEKEEPING: ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I redid the top section and used a different code for my blog-links pop-up menu; instead of randomly popping up everywhere, the links actually pull down and open up in new windows whenever you click on them. I hope this helps you guys who are stuck with 800x600 settings; so far no one has complained (yet) about the new links so I'm guessing they work better than the last ones. (If there's a problem, please  urlLink let me know ...Thanks!) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also added in a link to my blogroll (yes, it's an official one powered by  urlLink blogrolling  and everything!) so that those of you who like perusing through other people's blogrolls can view mine. It's basically the same links in the pulldown menu, but if you prefer to use the blogroll in the "seach companion" area, feel free to do so now! Also, if you have a blogroll and you like my site, you can now easily add The Randomness to your own roll with the link provided. :) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I've noticed a lot of people coming here because of Googlings for "Bud Light Commercials", "Real American Heros/Heroes", "Real Men of Genius/Genious", I figured I'd permanently put up the  urlLink link I found  where you can go to download all of those commercials.  Just be nice to the guy and have patience with him... The links go down on occasion, but that's because:  1.) He's only got 20 gigs of data transfer per month and it goes fast when everyone wants these commercials 2.) His site is ad-free and he wants to keep it that way  Either way, enjoy the commercials! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm still having fun with MT -- The  urlLink Lady Raven  has been kind enough to help me out.    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ OTHER: ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Hrrrm. Today I finally start another semester. In actuality, I was supposed to start  last  week, but... yet again   right on time  as always there was a problem with my scheduling and I finally got it fixed last Thursday. Heh. Joy.   You'd  think  they'd have everything corrected by  now ; after all, this is my penultimate semester at the school. Nope. Same old song-and-dance with the same people, same time every semester. So sad. I might as well have just created a recording of everything I needed to say and played it for the people. Heh.  I'd like to welcome the following to both my link collection and my blogroll:  urlLink Nasty Bastard : He's interesting, smart, amusing and from what I can see, has as much fun with photography and web-layouts as I do...  urlLink A Small Victory : She's snarky, her opinions are great to read and (here's the best part!) she has Lenore as a spokes-girl for her blog. Excellence!   urlLink Blogs of War : His first site (MostlyWasted) was hella amusing and all I have to say is:  PHOTOSHOP!!! WOO! (Take a look at his logo; it's great!  urlLink This ,  urlLink this , and  urlLink this  are also great as well...)  urlLink Moto-Blog :  Cars. If you love your car as much as I do, you'll understand where he's coming from...  I'm currently pondering  urlLink joining in on the fun , (first saw it on  urlLink Liz 's blog and subsequently on a  ton  of others as well now) but (as always) I'm late and I'm not so sure I'd be able to finish by the deadline. Ah well. Maybe. (20 credits is daunting though so I doubt I'll have any free time to actually  write ...) Yeah, a definite maybe.  Something amusing from  urlLink Vinny :  urlLink Nothin' like a slip-up ...  And  urlLink something else  I rather liked via  urlLink Lady Raven :   My Vampire Name   The Great Archives determine you to have gone by the identity:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarah Cromwell    Known in some parts of the world as:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mistress of Seducers    The Great Archives Record:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful and alluring - hiding great power, great danger.  Lastly, two old things that I still find amusing every so often:   urlLink Fireworks  and  urlLink Sandart .   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Well, it's 7:30 AM now, and I started this post much, much earlier in the morning...I think I'm going to eat breakfast, drink a gallon of coffee, powernap, and then head on out to school. See you all later and...   urlLink   DON'T FORGET TO VOTE FOR ARROGANT RANTS!!!!!

        LMAO!!!    HAH!!!  I was doing my laundry while my mom was watching CNN (yeah yeah, I know, it's  CNN , but sometimes they have funny stuff going on) and I happened to catch the tail-end of  urlLink News Night with Aaron Brown  -- Hoewever some youngish-looking blond kid was sitting in for Aaron (since the kid looks nothing like the guy in the picture).   Turns out the last segment of news stories didn't have any corresponding video, so they were improvising with amusing captions...  Something about a guy in Germany who was fired from a zoo for killing, grilling and eating 5 chickens and 3 goats (ancient news by blog-standards, I remember reading that story) and they showed a clip of a giant panda...  The last one however took the cake:  Soemthing about some female judge who was caught smoking marijuana at a Greatful Dead tribute show...And the monitor right next to his head was busy showing clips of a supermodel show complete with models in what  looked  like bikinis with the blinking caption, "Gratuitous Supermodel Footage"...And the camera started moving and zooming in on the monitor, while the kid snapped his fingers and said, "Hey! Focus!" and the camera returned to its original position...  At least, it was something like that....    I was too busy laughing my ass off!  :D

        Answering questions:    First of all, lemme say the version I'm attempting to use is 2.51, if that helps...  Lady Raven: Email sent! Check your inbox and thanks! : )  Lane:   1.) Give a little more detail about the error?  OK I'll try...   2.) What are you clicking on that creates the error?     It originally started after I imported my blogger file: when I click on the "Edit Entries" it immediately goes to a screen that says "An error occurred: Can't use an undefined value as a SCALAR reference at lib/MT/ObjectDriver/DBM.pm line 373." with the option to click on either "close" or "go back". Now, if I try to click on "Rebuild Site" it does the same thing.    3.) What page produces it?    The main page doesn't produce it, that's apparently ok, but whenever I attempt to update, that sneaky little error code happens.   4.) What is your favorite kind of sauce?  Depends on what I'm eating...    : )

        Hrrrm...    Might be holding off on that whole MovableType thing...Every time I  think  I've got it, something else fucks up.  Joy.  My current issue with it right now is this wonderful little error code:  Can't use an undefined value as a SCALAR reference at lib/MT/ObjectDriver/DBM.pm line 373.   WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT ABOUT!? AAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  Please, if you understand this, let me know. I'm tearing hair out, I'm so frustrated. Grrr.  Anyway, I think I'll get something to eat and then take a nap; I doubt that the fact that I haven't gotten any sleep is  helping  me at this point.  Heh.  On a completely random note, I want to see  urlLink 8 Mile . While I'm not normally too keen on Eminem, for some reason I really want to see this movie; I also find myself getting into his new song, "Lose Yourself". Well, at least  urlLink Vinny  understands...LOL!  : )   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤

        Quick Update:    This past week was the first week of what will hopefully be my penultimate semester of school...  I'm currently playing around with MovableType and so far it's interesting...  Insomnia is back with a vengeance....  Still tired. Yet, all is well. It's  Friday  after all...    :D    P.S. -- Here's  my   urlLink Friday Five :   1. Did you vote in your last elections?  Nope, not allowed to. Ah well, hopefully next time I'll be able to...   2. Do you know who your elected representatives are?  *shrug*  I've been hearing discussions about  every election  going on, I have no idea who's where anymore. Heh.   3. Have you ever contacted an elected representative? If so, what was it about?  Nope, never really had a need to. Unless you count those elementary school field trips so long ago....   4. Have you ever participated in a demonstration?  Yeap. My freshman year of HS -- I was enrolled in a Catholic high school. We had Religion class every week and at the time, there were only three Religion teachers; two nuns and a layperson.  Of course ,  the layperson  was my section's teacher, but she was crazy; she was more fanatical than the nuns were. Midway through the school year, she heard about some sort of anti-abortion rally down in D.C. so she got permission from the school to have a "field trip" in order to show "our support and school spirit". I signed up because we were promised extra points on our final averages...And being that Religion class wasn't exactly my favorite/best class, I figured it was worth it.  Add in the fact that we were exempt from school for the day and we didn't have to wear our stupid uniforms....IT was great! Heh. Have to say, I saw the craziest, most insane fucking people at that anti-abortion rally. Scared the hell out of me. But, it was worth the extra points and the day off from school.  I hated that teacher.   5. Have you ever volunteered in an election? What was the result?  Nope. Volunteer how?

        Mornin!          And so, I return to the digital arena of blogdom. Thanks to   Pyro  ,  urlLink Vinny ,  urlLink Leo  and  urlLink Jimmy  for your comments! :D  Didja miss me?   ; )    Let's get down to bizness...      RIGHT THIS SECOND, you should go over to  urlLink Daily Pundit  and vote for  urlLink ARROGANT RANTS !!!  You can vote up to  FIVE TIMES  "legally" -- Since some people couldn't figure out how they could vote multiple times, the easiest way to do so is to follow these 3 steps:  1.) Vote 2.) Wait until the results screen pops up 3.) Hit your "back" button and then Vote Again [repeat the process from Step 1]   VOTE!!!! DO IT!!!! Every time you sign online, go there and vote!!!!  Why?    Because if you DON'T, you'll see just how BLOOD-HUNGRY    I    can be.    Always remember that the  female  of a species is more deadly than the male...   >:D            Everyone go over to  urlLink Bent on World Domination  and welcome Nate into bloggin -- While it doesn't look like he's giving up on LiveJournal just yet, this is definately a step in the right direction! Woo! So...Bring gifts and make sure he feels at home.      Whew!   So, what's been goin on with me? Well, last week my cable modem decided to take a shit and subsequently die, so I have been blessed with the joy of dealing with dial-up. (Yeap, it's just as shitty as I remember.) Then my allergies decided to kick my ass and kill my sinuses, leaving me to drink a ton of (ick)  tea  and ingest an insane amount of allergy meds to deal with the flare up of sinusitis.    Joy .  Apart from  that  happening, I enjoyed my week off from school -- Woo!  Sleep!  Sort of. As all college students know, "sleep" is something of a myth. Either way, it was nice not having to make the trek out to the city every day, so that made me happy with my nice little vacation; I start the daily grind again today. (Yes, I said  today ; since it's my second-to-last semester, all the classes I need to take have time conflicts with one another. So, I wound up with a messed up schedule, one which has me commuting 4 hours round-trip for a 2 hour class. Anyone  else  see the stupidity in this or am I the only one??) In dealing with my bouts of insomnia, I've discovered that I still have the MuchMusic channel on my TV which has amused me; it's not quite how I remember it, but it's still good (hella better than MTV). Something else I learned was that the Foo Fighters band does the song "All My Life" -- For some odd reason I thought it was one of the neo-garage-punker-bands who did that song...  On a happy note, I've found my "prodigal son" Tripp and met his  girlfriend ...my old friend Liese!  WOO!  Damn it was interesting catching up with her. She's been through a  lot  (yes, that's an understatement, but I'm not about to discuss her life) but she's survived and it makes me just that much prouder of her that even after all that insanity, she's damn strong and she survived. Interesting -- Some of the light-hearted stuff that we talked about makes you want to believe in that "six degrees of separation" theory. Crazy stuff.   Talking about crazy stuff, how about the goings-on in the world since I've been away? Wellstone died, along with his wife and daughter -- I was watching one of the news-channels, can't rememeber if it was FoxNews or MSNBC or CNBC...Anyway, I just loved how they spent 10 minutes on the fact that  the man died  and then went on to discuss the profound impact this had on politics. It's like, what, you can't even say a few words about the fact that  he fucking died along with half of his family  before getting into the politics??  That  was crap. Total utter crap. While I don't agree with what Wellstone represented, at least I never forgot that he was a living, breathing human being. And what about that "memorial"? Ridiculous. Why don't they just skip the shit and start dancin on his grave? And what gets me most is: that was his own political party that behaved like that.  Wow . Now I completely understand the phrase, "With friends like that, who needs enemies?" In-fucking-sane.   What else? Hrrrrm.. Ah yes! I added in that grinning graphic (an easy link to  urlLink DailyPundit  so you can vote for ARROGANT RANTS! WOO!  ; ) Yeap, I can easily work in shameless plug  anywhere , LOL) so that those of you with 800x600 screen resolutions can see ALL of the links contained within the pop-up screens. You should now be able to scroll through to the top of the boxes.   Well, it's 7:48 AM, and I need to drive to East Bumblefuck in order to get my cable modem fixed, so I think I should head on offline now.   I'm BAAA-AAAAACK!      >:D

        Pictures...    Well, I didn't get any pictures of the get together earlier this evening, but I must say, it was nice to finally meet  urlLink Dr. Manhattan . (Although, for some odd, strange reason I thought he was of Spanish descent...Ah well. Still a good guy!) We were few (me,  urlLink Nick ,  urlLink Jane ,  urlLink the god ,  urlLink Asp , and of course  urlLink Dr. Manhattan ) but we still had a good time. Inspired by  urlLink the restaurant  the conversation (well, when Nick and I walked into it at least) was about religion...Then it covered everything from bad movies, good literature, medical problems (and how to solve them of course!) and...well... interesting  business start-up ideas. :)   However, I do have a few pictures from the party on the 28th, but only of those of us who got there early. Sorry! I guess it's for the best...    In this picture we have:  urlLink Liz ,  urlLink Ken , me and  urlLink Paul     Yeap, that's  urlLink Ken ! :)  Enjoy the pictures and if I don't get to speak with any of you today...   HAVE A HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!      :D

        Random quotes    That I rather like and wish to share:   "We will export death and violence to the four corners of the earth in defense of our great nation." -- Random uncredited CIA person  "We don't want to fight, but by jingo if we do /  We 've got the ships, we 've got the men, we 've got the money too!" -- Old war song  "You can have anything you want -- if you want it badly enough. You can be anything you want to be, do anything you set out to accomplish if you hold to that desire with singleness of purpose." -- Abraham Lincoln  "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." -- Eleanor Roosevelt   "It is the nature of man to rise to greatness if greatness is expected of him." -- John Steinbeck    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Whee! I love parties...And the more impromptu and spontaneous the gathering, the more I'll enjoy it! (And  urlLink Ken ? Why not  Bonnie and Clyde  instead of Ozzie and Harriet?? LOL :D Still made me laugh though! ) A day of recuperation between BlogBashes is good enough for me...Of course, right now the insomnia is back and kicking my ass.. Joy. Ah well, I'm going to try to force myself to sleep after this post. God knows I need it. ( urlLink Nick 's right, the commute is hell -- I swear, the 2:55AM train was just as packed as one of my  normal  rush hour trains...Crazy shit! The only difference is that the rest of the passengers on the 2:55 train were goddamn loud and fucking annoying as all hell. I wouldn't trade my normal commuters for those bastards. At least most of them got off semi-early on the local run. Heh.)  Pictures forthcoming after  tomorrow's  later today's party.  See you all later!    :D

        I woke up this morning    To my dog barking excessively. After letting her outside and feeding her Cheerios for breakfast, I flipped on FoxNews Channel and this scary-looking woman-thing was on my television set telling me that the her company ( urlLink Clonaid  -- Not sure if the link works, my computer has a habit of not showing working links) helped produce the first cloned human baby. Oh,  lovely . After listening to her talk about the baby, but produce no pictures, no happy mommy and daddy, not even a name...I started to wonder if she was for real. Then she launched into this whole spiel about how she believed she was created by scientists and that if her production was the good result of science, her gift of this cloning technology was good science and much better than the science that allows you to blow people up. That's when it was confirmed for me that she was kooky. She talked more about her  urlLink Raelian philosophy  (again, the link might work on your computer, mine's acting up) and how Rael influeneced her work than she did about the newborn baby. Heh.  I'm not sure whether to believe this. After all, you're asking me to believe that you've successfully cloned a human being, that it was born on Thursday, but you don't have pictures. You don't have any charts or figures or test results or  anything  that resembles research leading up to this momentus event. (And yes, even if it goes against every ideal possible that you hold dear, it would still be a momentous event...After all, it's not every day that you have a scientifically created cloned baby born.) And  then   you tell me that another one is due in a week from now? Wait, let me guess...You  won't  have pictures, charts, figures or test results for  that  one either. Heh.  I don't know. Dubious, at best. I'm sure the technology is out there; probably in its early or middle stages, but I'm sure its out there. After all, we can clone human organs, is a full human clone that far off? However, as the correspondent commented on FoxNews, even Dolly's (the cloned sheep) creation and existance (along with all the research) wasn't completely explained or released to the public until she was six months old (and even  then , they showed pictures/movies of her). While you can't really put a sheep and a human in the same category, when they're both scientifically cloned and the results of research, they're pretty much both in the same category. Harsh? Maybe, but what I think is truth. I don't mind creating human organs (hearts, lungs, livers, etc) for transplantation -- After all, there is a shortage of donors out there, why  not  use the technology in a  good  way to allow sick people to get better and live a normal life instead of playing the horrible waiting game of, "Hey you might die soon if we don't find the right donor"? But one you cross into cloning a full human...That's where things get tricky.  Anyway, something else I'm left to ponder...Who in their  right minds  would allow that scary woman-thing  near them ?? If it was me, I'd run screaming into the night if she ever came near me...  Heh.   (MyWay news has a  urlLink link to the story , complete with picture. Enjoy!)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Something else to ponder that  urlLink Nick brought up  ...What kind of people want to clone themselves in order to have children when there are other, better alternatives? Didn't really see it from that aspect as I was too busy being horrified at the hideousness on my television screen that was spewing forth hot air. However, being that I am a big proponent of adoption, that's something I'd definitely ask the two "parents" -- There are so many babies and children out there who need good homes and loving parents, why didn't they consider adopting?  Then again, if they are so full of themselves as to clone themselves in order to have children, then I guess I'm glad the didn't consider. Better for true parents to adopt than for them to fall into the wrong hands.

        Hi.       I'm taking a small break for a couple of days to breathe, enjoy life, see LotR: The Two Towers, hang out with Nick, meditate, hang out with other friends and generally just let my spirit catch up with me again.   Thanks for visiting and enjoy the picture...I'll be back soon :)

        *Ponder*    Apparently the unions were appeased (for now) and the Transit Strike  urlLink has been postponed indefinitely . (NY Times, registration required).   Officials with Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union postponed a threatened walkout late last night, saying that there had been progress in contract talks as the deadline neared. But the union officials declined to say how long they would continue negotiations past the deadline before deciding whether to call a strike.  "We'd like to announce that we have made sufficient progress to stop the clock," the local's secretary-treasurer, Ed Watt, said at a brief news conference at the Grand Hyatt Hotel moments after midnight. "This progress has been made primarily in the noneconomic areas of dignity and respect for our members."    Lovely. So you're saying you can probably get me to school, but later in the day, who knows? You guys just might say, "Screw this!" and leave me stranded in the city. Joy.  Wonderful .   Looks like I'm gonna be driving in today...Just in case. Sorry guys, but as much as I love the city, I'd really like to go  home  after my time is done there.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Here's something odd (to me, at least) that I feel the need to mention....At 02:15:46 AM this morning, a person using AOL 8.0 (Daaaamn, they're up to 8.0 now? Wow, I'm behind the times...) came to my site via this referral off of Google: http://www.google.com/search?q="Zachary Gazza"&hl=en&lr=&ie=   Interesting, odd, strange...I'm so used to seeing the usual "Budweiser Commercials" and the other random phrases that somehow get people here, but this is the first time a non-famous name from Blogdom is bringing someone here. (Sorry  urlLink Asp , but you're pretty famous!) What really got me was the fact that someone's searching for Zachary Gazza,  and  they came  here . Now that's random! LOL!  So of course, me being the curious Ravenwolf that I am, I decided to check out the Google listings; after all, it's kinda weird that the person decided to come to  my  site looking for him...Heh~! And apparently I'm #3 of only 3 listings.   Well my dear AOLer, good luck finding him! And if you ever do, say hello for me! (Not that he'd remember me or know this name or anything, LOL, but hey, it's that thought that counts, right?)  Random. Makes me wonder why he's being searched out. That's cool though. I guess it's nice to be searched out if you're important enough to someone to be searched for, you know? Ah well, maybe that's just my insomnia talking.(If I see someone coming here from Google looking for Zach Zaleski as well as Zach Gazza, that's when I'll  really start to freak out! LOL)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Which makes me wonder...If I start posting random names of people I was once friends with but lost contact with throughout the years, would they eventually find me via searching on Google? It seemed to  urlLink work for Lane ...Hrrm. I'm curious. Let's see...      John "Atreyu" Ratcliff   -- Where the hell did you disappear to? Mon frère, back when we spoke regularly, you lived in Pleasanton, Cali(fuckin)fornia...Then again that was in 1996. Did you finally escape? What happened to you?  I wonder what   Mark Kirol   is doing now? Last I heard he cleaned up his act and moved out to AZ somewhere, but...That's all heresay.    Noel Garvey  ...Well, his name was William Noel Garvey, but I always knew him as Noel...He was cool. I heard he was a firefighter in Far Rockaway...    Mike Lemanski  ,   Adam Dooling  ,   Germaine Haro  ...These people just dropped off of the face of the Earth, so if they don't want to be found, I'm cool with that. However, it'd still be nice to know if they're still alive.  I wonder if the  Stacey Kleiber  of WWE fame is the same Stacy Kleiber that I used to go to Elementary school with? She's supposedly the right age to be so. Honestly? I sincerely hope it IS her! Why? Because the Stacy that I knew used to get made fun of all the time. If they are one and the same person, I'll bet all the boys that made fun of her way back when are now the men who are drooling over her now...Hah! That would rule. Ahhh, if it IS her, then karma is a wonderful thing.   >: )      ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Back in business with my monitor and cable modem. All is well with the world again. Now if only I could cure my insomnia, I'd be a better, well-rested person...Ah well, can't win them all I guess.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Yes, I saw Star Trek: Nemesis. I thought it was hilarious! It could have been a great movie if the cheesy/campy bits were taken out. I mean, come   on  , when you're taking pages out of the Dukes of Hazard book...Heh! Not to mention the fact that Wannabe Evil Overlord looked a tad too much like a young Dr. Evil clad in badass leather...Well, at least my group was pretty much alone in the theater so we could MST3K it with impunity. HAH! That made it all worthwhile... (If you want a better/truer review, let me know. I'd rather not spoil it for the rest of the people out there who might actually want to see it and judge for themselves!)   :D     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Well, I think I'm going to attempt to take a nap now; if those wonderful Union workers decide to go through with the Transit Strike, someone please call me and let me know!      >:)

       urlLink    Grrrr!    I apoloize for not posting again. Many things have happened in the past couple of days; something very notable has happened in my life and I am happy to say that things have gone my way. (No, I won't say exactly what it is yet, but those who need to know already do.)   :D    The bad thing is that my monitor has decided to permanently take a nap. It went into "powersave mode" and decided that it likes that mode better than actually working. I'm hoping that it will "wake up" soon, but until it does, posting will be light as I can't stand using the other computer in the house.    Other than that, my geek side is in full force: Star Trek: Nemesis is now out and next week LotR: Two Towers opens.  HELL YEAH!!!  w00t!!  LOL!  (Sorry love, but I'm draggin you out to see them too!)    ; )    OK, well I'm not sure if I like this whole "referral code" javascript. It seems like a waste of space, so...I will probably get rid of it as soon as I get back on my normal computer. (Stupid dial up makes things so slow...Blaargh!)  See you all soon!  (P.S.  Welcome back,  urlLink Leonard !)    :D

        Curious...    I've been noticing that a lot of people in a short amount of time have snapped up and  urlLink started using this little piece of javascript  on their blogs to track and post incoming referrals to their site. I'm going to add in the code for a day to see if it works for me. If I like it, I'll add it in as a permanent fixture the next time I change my layout. If not, well then...At least it was cool for a little while.  Let's see how this goes: if it's a nifty addition, let me know!     :D

        Interesting...    So.   Every time I've taken the  urlLink Keirsey test , my result is: ENFP. (Two explanations for ENFPs are found  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .)  However,  this new  test has decided to tell me that I'm an ENTP. Odd...  Your Type is: ENTP (Extroverted Intuitive Thinking Perceiving)   Strength of the preferences: Extroverted: 11% Intuitive: 44% Thinking: 11% Perceiving: 11%    ENTP type description by D.Keirsey   ENTP type description by J. Butt and M.M. Heiss     Qualitative analysis of your type formula | You are:  slightly expressed extrovert  moderately expressed intuitive personality  slightly expressed thinking personality  slightly expressed perceiving personality      Something new to ponder...(Take the test yourself  urlLink here  -- Thanks  urlLink Nate ...)

        Happy News!!!    Thanks guys for your positive thinking~!  Lucky comes home today from the vet!  Of course we've got a lot of work to do even at home, but the vet tells me she'll be up and running around (futilely chasing squirrels again) by sometime next week. I'm excitied! :D   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤  Quick Randomness  ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Go congratulate Leo on his  urlLink new site  -- And tell him to post more!!!  :)  (He's about as close to a BlogChild as I will ever get...SO BE NICE TO HIM!!!!)   :D   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    I'm glad  urlLink Vinny  got me hooked on  urlLink My Way  -- It really does have everything you need without those damn ads! :D  Plus, if you personalize your own My Way page, you get everything right there, down to your own pictures and Daily Puns and other fun stuff...But I think the best thing that they link  to is  urlLink JOUST!!!!!  How awesome is that? Man, I used to play this game all the time when I was little; brings back good memories. :D   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Something  urlLink randomn  via  urlLink Sasha : (I got 10 of 14 correct...)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Paul's posted two collections ( urlLink one  and  urlLink two ) of lovely pictures from the snow day we had...Go check them out! :)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    Here's something I stumbled on via  urlLink the nasty bastard  and  urlLink Annessa ... urlLink East Side vs. West Side: Blogger Party style!  Heh, we  all  know the truth. EAST SIDE ALL THE WAY!!!!  ; )  And so, here goes:  urlLink      Of course  I'll throw my support behind some other fellow Easteners. (And if you don't believe that their parties are wild, go check out the pictures.)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Well, I think that's it for now; Lucky's coming home and I'm happy!

        Ahhh, snow...    I'd like to frolic in the snow, but right now it's all toasty warm inside so...Heh.   Lethargy...sinking...in...  In all actuality, I'm going stir-crazy and it hasn't even been that long. Ah, the joys of doing situps and pushups and crunches on my floor to move and stay normal. Currently listening to  urlLink Hannity  on  urlLink 770  (you can  urlLink listen in as well ) and man, this Colonel is annoying the hell out of me. Listen man, make your point, then shut up and let the other debater speak; interrupting and talking over the other person is annoying, rude, and anger-inducing. If you want to get your point across, that is decidedly  not  the way to go about it. Didn't they teach you manners? Respect? What the hell?  On a completely different note,  urlLink this is cute and yet slightly disturbing.  Enjoy.  My dog still isn't home and there hasn't been any updates. With the snowstorm, I'm hoping she'll be ok; she doesn't like storms at all...I hope she's ok.

        Exit 75, I'm still alive...I'm still alive...    Hey all, I had a really shitty day yesterday. I'm just writing to say that yeah, I'm still alive.   Please hold positive thoughts; my dog's going through a rough time right now. All last night she was whining, crying and howling...Which is very uncharacteristic for her. I got home from school today to find her missing and my parents told me that she was vomiting the entire day. When it got to the point that she couldn't even keep down water, they drove her to the vet's office and the vet said that she needed to stay overnight for observation. If she continues to vomit up even water, she might have to be put to sleep.   After the recent death of my mom's dog...Well...I'm not doing so well.  Just. Yeah. Not been a good day at all. (There was also the problem I had with an asshole driving a large F-350 sized truck who tried to run me off the road three times, but he's a shithead and right now that's neither here nor there...I miss my pup.)  So, hold positive thoughts for my Lucky please. Thanks.

        Hrrrrrm...    It's kinda sad to see my happy Randomness all alone and stagnant after I put so much time into it...I'm not quite sure that I want it to die, even though  urlLink Anomaly 's up and running. Conundrum. (That and MT still doesn't like importing files from Blogger. Heh!)  Hrrrm.   I think I'll keep posting a little randomness here every so often...After all, it's made me happy for a while. I owe at least that much to this little piece of digitalia I created.  (And hello to everyone from  urlLink I AM That Much !

        Whee!    So...I'm making progess with MT and life is good. (Now all I have to do is wait for my friend to come online and help me out with a few snags along the way...) I have  urlLink Authority Zero 's "One More Minute" stuck in my head as I contemplate how wonderful  urlLink JASSM s are (thanks  urlLink John & Paul !), the  urlLink stupidity of ELF members  (Hey guys? Here's a newsflash for ya. Your message isn't going to be taken seriously if you run around wrecking shit; all you're successfully doing is making die-hard, long-time enemies to your cause by your stupidity...), the sheer beauty of having an  urlLink ex-KGB guy praise Bush , and wondering why it has taken professors so long to  urlLink bitch about comps with internet access in the classroom .   On that last one: I'm ambivalent to having comps in the classroom. On the one hand, it makes taking notes  much  easier as I tend to think better with my hands on a keyboard  and  I don't have to decipher my horrible handwriting at the end of the day to try to make sense of what I was attemping to copy from the board. (I tend to write in shorthand half the time and messily so in trying to keep up with the professor.) On the other hand, I can understand their frustration as I know I'm just as guilty as the next student for checking my bloglist for new posts (and yes, email too) and ignoring the lesson when I get bored. Ah well, I guess it's a necessary evil. (You can read  urlLink other opinions here ; the ones that made it into the editorials.) However, the one thing I  can't  stand is cell phones goin off in the middle of class. Hey people, that's what the "silent" or "vibrate" function on your fucking phone is for. (What? Your cell phone is old/outdated and you  don't  have those options on it? Easy fix: TURN THE FUCKING THING OFF!!! Thanks. Shithead.) It's really goddamn annoying to hear your standard Nokia ringer going off very loudly in the middle of a lecture. Also, who the fuck are you that you're getting calls in the middle of class? What, do your "peeps" not know that you go to school? And I don't give a shit WHO you are, you are NOT important enough to take the call in the middle of class and start having a grand old conversation!! If someone's dying or in the hospital, maybe I can understand, but when you begin your converation with  "Whuddup Son, where you at??" we ALL know it's a call that can wait. Shithead.    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Moving right along, I found a link to the  urlLink WebElements Periodic Table  on  urlLink No Watermelons ' blog. Interesting! I happen to like  urlLink Rhenium ; some of you will understand  why . To the rest of you...Well, if you don't get it, it's ok.   ; )     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Also, to attest to the fact that our female soldiers can beat the shit outta anyone who gets in their way...Here's one of their past-times:  urlLink Boxing ! (via  urlLink MyWay ) Hell yeah! Best part of the article (or at least the line  I  like the best!):   "We're friends - just not when we're in there," Dull, 26, of Battle Creek, Mich., said as she chewed on her mouth guard.   HELL YEAH! I like it!!  Much love and respect to them all! Yeah you're gonna kick some serious shit!!   :D     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Hrrrm... urlLink Ken  got me addicted to  urlLink Craigslist Missed Connections  -- Hella funny shit goes on there, but after reading some of them, I just get sad; makes me wish they find who they're looking for!   :/   Call me a hopeless romantic, I don't care. LOL! I feel bad for some of them because, man, I remember bein shy and never getting the courage to say "hey" to people I found interesting. Ah well. Good luck to them all.   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   I'd say something about the stupidity of the RIAA and  urlLink why its website keeps getting hacked , but Vinny's already  urlLink done  a  urlLink good job  of it so go there and read. (Also, I  know  you've signed  urlLink the pledge , right?  RIGHT??  IF you haven't, I'm upset at you. Grrr.)     ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Well, I love my digicam, but now I'm itchin for prints. LOL! I know with my camera I can get some pretty awesome-quality pictures from my printer....but...There's just something about having a nice 8x10 print in your hand and the negatives labeled and stowed away nicely and neatly in your photo-binder. Ah well, that'll teach me to rely solely on the digicam! (Note to self: Do NOT forget to bring normal camera with you when you leave the house.)   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   I need more books to read. Any suggestions? I just finished  urlLink The Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in Politics ...Pretty good, although I have the feeling that I would have understood it more if I had read  The Captive Mind  before it. Ah well. My next two books on tap are  urlLink Fighting Back: The War on Terrorism from Inside the Bush White House  and  urlLink Bush at War  (as soon as Nick lets me borrow them, lol! I've been wanting to read them for awhile and it seemed silly to buy them for myself when I could just easily borrow them...) So, like I said, any suggestions after those two?    ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Lots of fellow bloggers are redoing their blogs and/or getting new ones...I know I'm late on some of them but hey, better late than never, right? Here you go:     urlLink Dave  and  urlLink The Sound and Fury  upgraded to MT  Moto-Blog turned into  urlLink Ride  with a spiffy new layout  Andrea walked away from her  urlLink Headquarters  in order to  urlLink Dream    urlLink Nick Denton  and  urlLink Elizabeth Spiers  combined forces and formed  urlLink Gawker    urlLink Dan  has a new  urlLink blog    urlLink Leonard  came back to play!   urlLink Alan Daniels  is also in the process of upgrading to MT   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤    I think that's it for now...I've made my favorite quote a permanent part of my site now.  Hell yeah!  *dances around*  Time to sleep.   :D

And now, I'm gonna go get trashed over at my brother's place with the rest of the Pack. Heh!   Byebye!     :)     [[:: raven wolf :: 1/1/2003 12:00:25 AM ::]]   ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤ ¤¤¤   Grrr.

        OK    Blogger is pissing me off. What the fuck? It lost a post and now keeps randomly moving my goddamn posts into "drafts" for no apparent fucking reason. WHAT THE FUCK!?  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!   >:(

        Maybe it's just me...    But after watching the ball drop, I think that Dick Clark is the world's oldest and first successful cyborg there is. There's no other explanation for why that man looks like he's frozen in time when we all know he's gotta be pretty damn old.  Anyway...Time to get trashed!     :D

        And so it goes...    Happy Birthday to The Randomness! Yeap, 1 year ago today, I started this blog on the run and at the end of a class -- It was called "The Joys of C++" for awhile before I realized that I hated that name...LOL!!   I still don't like C++. Never did, probably never will, but blogging? I'm down with blogging. :)  Nice to see this little creation of mine survive a year and spawn my other blogs ( urlLink Piscean Dreams ,  urlLink Feeding My Addiction  and of course the new ones  urlLink Anomaly  and  urlLink Digitalia )...And even help out a few others find their own way to blogging!  Well, The Randomness has been good to me, overall. I enjoy this little piece of Internet I've called my own for a year...Good luck to the rest of you out there who've just started!    :D

        February.    Everything's getting red now. The candy is prevalent  everywhere  you turn and the fuzzy plushie animals with hearts and cute sayings on them are taking up a large part of store displays now. Looks like Valentine's Day is around the corner and sneaking up on me again...LOL! At least  urlLink Anomaly 's taken care of; I rather like the red. It's a nice deviation from my norm (then again, that could just be my own opinion). Ah well. I'm happy with it. It never ceases to amaze me how these holidays just pile on one after another. Damn those chocolates that call my name everytime I walk into CVS; I want to buy a box, but then I laugh at myself. All this work and I'll kill it for a box of chocolates? Naaaah. Especially when I'm seeing progress again. After 3 months of frustration/insanity/annoyance/almost-giving-up, I  finally  broke my damn weight plateau and am starting the happy drop down the scale. I have the feeling that walking to school everyday wearing 6 layers of clothing, my heavy winter coat and 20 pounds of bookbag has helped things along; as well as those nice hills that I traverse on my way. It's all good.   :D    Talked to a classmate about how fast this semester went by; and yet, so close to the end it feels like it's  c r  a   w    l     i      n        g . So close to the end, so  close ! I can't wait. Still having issues with scheduling; however, there are so many of us who are in the same boat that we're going to form a coalition and storm the Dean's office to get things changed. It's ridiculous! All the class conflicts that occur because there's only 2 offered sections of each class that you aboslutely need to take...And they all are sceduled for the same time. There's nothing I'd like more to give that Dean a piece of my mind, but that woule get me nowhere. Better to rant over lunch with friends and get it all out of my system before I face that power-crazed bitch. Bleh.  Anyway, I'm going to tinker with  urlLink Digitalia  before I start on some schoolwork that needs to get done. See you later...    :D

        My birthday came and went    Overshadowed by the sadness of  urlLink those who were lost  and the incredible  urlLink show of stupidity . I guess my lack of celebration on this 20th works with the time.  What else can I say? My birthday has always had interesting things happen, but this...? *shakes head* I'd rather have had a dull day, thanks.  Ah well, I'm glad its over.   ...Short post, I know, but I'm tired. Weary. I need a hug.    :/

        IT's been awhile...    And so I feel the need to update the Randomness. It's time.   I'm on a Ska kick again. Well, let me rephrase that; in all honesty, it never really left. What got it kick-started was going to  urlLink Mikey 's show awhile back at the Rodeo Bar (yeahyeahyeah, I  know  the  urlLink Belmont Playboys  are considered Rockabilly, but... Manohman! ! Hell yeah! Made me dance!!) so ever since then I've been itchin' for more happy/dancy music. Out comes the Mustard Plug, the Scofflaws, the Spider Nick and the Maddogs, the Mephiskapheles and others...Yes. Joy! Something to take my mind off the 5 inches of snow that got dumped on my lawn. Not that I mind the snow, really...It's truly beautiful and it usually makes me happy to see it. But quite frankly, I've had enough snow for this year. Bring on the spring! Bring on my flowers! Excellence. (Mikey, you  really  need to come back to NYC soon and play!! Soon!!)  As for the battle of the flesh? It goes well. Gym time is getting to be extreme now, as I'm starting to go everyday for cardio and 3 times a week for the actual strength training workouts. There is a chance that I will get down to 145-155 by the end of July. So exciting! Hard work, but it's getting better, easier now; good to have the support from my loved ones and friends alike. And even though it's going frustratingly slow, I'm seeing and feeling results so I know it's working. Ah well. Good things come to those who wait, right?   My birthday's coming up soon; I'm ambivalent. Sometimes I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders and I feel much,  much  older than what I am. Other days, I feel like such a youngster since the people I normally associate with are all older than me. *shrug* Just one of those things. I didn't feel any different last year; I'm not worried.   :)    So...If you want to get on my good side, send me Ska! Send me Rockabilly! Send me anything that's within those genres that is dancy and awesome! FEED MY ADDICTION!!! (Come on, you KNOW you want to...)    ; )    And on that note, it's time to sleepy, but I promise to update here more often...Nitey nite!   :D

         urlLink Gibson  Girl...    Apparently, William Gibson had a  urlLink blog . I say had because he's done with it now. I found out about it via  urlLink Bigwig  who found a  urlLink Wired article  explaining the death of the blog.   Damned.   Gibson is one of my favorite authors; the first book I read of his was Mona Lisa Overdrive. (Yes, I do realize that Neuromancer is the first and most famous one of all his books, but at the time I had no idea.) What pulled me to MLO was the  urlLink cover of the book  itself; when I was younger, that quicksilver mask-like face freaked me the hell out, but I swallowed my fear and bought the book...And promptly spent 2 hours devouring it from cover to cover, completely and happily immersed in Mona's world. (Even to this day, that cover leaves me unsettled. I have no idea why.) The book stood alone and well-enough so. I never thought it was part of a chain until I read Count Zero and found the seedlings of Mona's story there. Then I picked up Virtual Light, but it took me a while to warm to that story. Much later on in life (maybe 3 months ago?), I picked up Neuromancer, and everything started to make sense. Now I'm reading ALL the books, this time in order. I'm up to Idoru and started reading it on the train this morning: I'm up to p. 167 now and will probably finish it on the commute home (if I don't nap).   But here's the funny thing; even though Gibson is pretty much the recognized father of cyberpunk and has written all these wonderful books that I love, it never even occurred to me that he would have an online presence. Never once did that thought cross my mind; it just seems so  accessible  and I still have the mentality that famous people can't be accessible. Same with  urlLink Neil Gaiman  and  his   urlLink journal ; it still surprises me that he's out there and open.   Hell, they're  human ; they're real people underneath the mantle of "author". You can write them email, read their thoughts, their opinions...I would have never in a million years thought of them as accessible people with hopes and dreams. All these years I've just held them in high regard, put them in their tier and let it go.   Interesting. Too bad I discovered Gibson's blog too late; oh well. Maybe I'll poke around his archives for a bit and see what he has chosen to share with the world.

I wrote something nice for Easter and it got eaten. Yes, I know that was a couple of days ago, but I got so annoyed that I didn't bother to even  look  at the Blogger page. Ah well. I  will  write, I promise you (probably live from C++ later on today) so never fear! LOL  Update: And now, it looks like my Enegram Test result post got eaten too...Joy. I'll just have to dig up the results again and repost it...

        Remind me to NOT mess with webstuff at 3am.    It's just not worth it, because something so severely simple turns into a project and then you mess everything up. And  then  the frustration hits and all you want to do is pull your hair out. Not good.   Yah. I say this because I was trying to upgrade my MT to version 2.63 and it just didn't work. Out of pure frustration, I deleted EVERYTHING, but forgot to drop my SQL tables...  Grrrr. Just fuckin  grrrrrrrrrr . Oh well, back to square one.     >:(

        Wondering...    Where I've been? Well, these two responsibilities known as "college classes" and "going to the gym" take up a lot of my time. There's also the ongoing pet project that is the reorganization/refurnishing and cleaning of my room (you'd think that OSHA was coming to inspect it). These things  have  to get done; there's just no bones about it. Sorry. :/  And then there's the wonderful things that keep me offline...Like spending time with someone I  urlLink love .  That  makes everything worthwhile. :)  Things are going well on the weight issue. I'm still too paranoid to step on the scale though, but two days ago, I discovered that I could literally pull off one of my favorite pairs of pants without undoing the button and zipper. I swear to you, it's the little victories that make everything worthwhile. Continuing on that note, I can now lift 90 lbs. Cardio is still a problem for me, because I don't like it that much; I see it as a necessary evil. However, being able to run full tilt for 2 minutes straight on a level 3 hill makes me happy! Soon I'll gather the courage to step on that scale.  On a side note to the weight issue and the cleaning-of-room issue...I always knew that my issues with weight were deep-seated, but I never would have guessed the extent to how deep it really goes. As I was cleaning, I came across some old school work of mine dated back all the way to first grade. Stuffed within the shuffle of papers was a drawing I had apparently made of a bloated sun with a toothy grin that took up the entire piece of paper. I had drawn this sun saying, "I need to go on a diet!"   The year on it told me that I had created this drawing at the ripe old age of  seven .  What seven year old gives a damn about his or her weight? Hell, what seven year old is conscious of a weight issue at that age?! I don't know the answer to that. I would  hope  that it isn't that many. Children should not have to deal with such problems so early in life. Children should focus on being  children  and enjoy it; to discover the world and play. A seven year old should be concerned with what sport to play, what coloring book to color in,  not  if s/he should go on a goddamn diet.  It's at times like this I get frustrated with my parents; especially my mother. What possessed her to instill this paranoia/obsession/issue with weight into me at such a young age?? I'll never understand. I guess the drive to perceived perfection was too much. I'll never know. All I know is that I derived a  lot  of pleasure ripping that picture up and feeding it to my paper shredder. I felt somewhat vindicated in doing so; like I was taking back a piece of my life for the seven year old I once was.    Ahh well. It's time to sleep for me. Tomorrow I get up early and hit the gym once more in order to continue to fight the good fight against fat.   IT's all or nothing, this time.    :)

However, Ann does have pictures of herself on  urlLink her site  so knock yourself out and tell her  I  sent ya! (Nah, just kidding. I'm sure she wouldn't care about The Randomness.)    :)     Well, just thought I'd share that amusement with you all (and provide some help to those of you who came here lookin for the pictures...glad I could help!) and with that, I bid you goodnight.

        Normally...    I leave my quiz results in Feeding My Addiction, but I wanted to share this one:       You are a pre-owned Civic Sedan. No, you haven't been shortchanged; in fact, you've been around and have experienced things others haven't. You tend to think of your dents as badges of honour rather than memories of a tough past. The lessons you've learned will help you to live a long and happy life.   urlLink which honda are you?  |  urlLink visit high mileage     Why? It reminded me of  urlLink Xaeli .  Sure she had her scrapes and dents, but it's true: to me, they were more like battlescars...Something to be proud of, even though I caused my poor car a lot of problems in my youthful stupidity. We had fun together in the 6 years of my proud ownership of that car.   I almost feel bad for  urlLink Methos : he's got a lot to live up to.

        Random thought    School just started again; right when I was beginning to enjoy the vacation too. Heh. Funny how things happen; the few friends I had here have all moved on. Some decided to "stop wasting their time with school" in order to work more hours and get more money in order to pay their rent. Others decided to transfer to other schools. One graduated, and I'm really proud of him! But what gets me the most is...After so many semesters of complaining about our complab computers, we  finally  got new terminals. Hell the lab even  smells  new! We used to joke over the fact that by the time we graduated, the school labs would get refitted...And of course, I'm the only one left to use them.   So I'm sitting at one of these terminals right now, typing away at a new keyboard that  actually works the way it's supposed to  and isn't broken/dinged/dirty/nasty, and I'm reveling. I think this is the first time I've been able to use the computers in the lab and  not  wanted to run to the nearest hospital for disinfection.   I'm so excited. How sad is that? LMAO  Yeah, that's about right.   :D

        Interesting...     urlLink Game Makers Aren't Chasing Women   (Wired News):   "I'm not a big fan of pink games," said T.L. Taylor, an assistant communications professor at North Carolina State University who has done extensive research on women and gaming. "Making games in which you get women to do 'women things' isn't a very successful strategy. Women enjoy combat in ways that go beyond the stereotypical notion that women are social and men like to fight."     I agree with this T.L. Taylor person. " Pink  games"? What the hell? You know what I think of when I hear that? Something insanely cheesy like, "Barbie's CD-ROM of Make-up Fun!" (Maybe I'd like it if it was presented as a first-person shooter in which you get to kill Barbie and her minions.) I don't know, but it seems like Taylor has things straight.    Laurel's Purple Moon, which was founded and folded in the late 1990s, was part of a movement toward "pink games" -- titles and activities aimed specifically at young girls and women. Now the thinking seems to be geared toward getting the industry to make more games like the King's Quest series and The Sims that both genders like to play.   Which makes me wonder; what exactly would be the games that Purple Moon would have created if it stayed alive? What "titles and activities" would this Laurel person think I'd enjoy simply because I'm a woman? Growing up I played Castle Wolfenstein on the computer just as easily as I played Mario Bros. on Nintendo. Arkanoid was a favorite arcade game, right up there with Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. The only reason I owned a GameBoy was for Tetris and Dr. Mario. I enjoyed the puzzle games just as much as I enjoyed the action games; hell half the time I liked the action games more because they were "cooler".  To this day I still enjoy the old-school puzzle games, even though the new breed of shoot-em-ups, fighters, action and RPGs are exceptional. So what kind of "pink game" would Purple Moon have given me growing up? Would Laurel have been able to reconcile "female" and "action games"? Or would she have given me "Barbie's CD-Rom of Make-up Fun!"?   Heh.   And this trend of going solely towards games like "The Sims"...I'm sure there's appeal out there for it (how many expansion packs are there now??), but it sure as hell isn't my cup of tea. Give me Quake and I'll be happy. Hell, I'd rather play 16 hours of Tetris straight than waste my time with The Sims. As for "King's Quest"? Never played it, so I can't formulate an opinion on it.    One of the key ways such games can exclude women is in the "hyper-sexualized" avatar choices they are offered, with distended Lara Croft-like physiques, Taylor said. The proportion of women playing such games would likely increase if they were given more freedom to choose the way in which they're electronically represented.    ...And then T.L. Taylor says something like this makes me wonder. I'm happy with the games that are out now for the most part. So what if Lara Croft would be completely lopsided and top-heavy if she was a real human? Take a look at Barbie and see what she'd be as a real human; if I recall correctly Barbie's proportions are completely off as well. Which one is worse? I'd say Barbie. Why? Barbie is THE doll that countless girls spanning generations were expected to play with. Tall, blonde, skinny, she had the big house, shiny car and fancy wardrobe, complete with clone-like friends and little sisters. Oh yeah, and that silly male companion that never did anything and had nothing of value to him. I'm sure if you look into it, you can gather a whole lot of psychological crap that's being force-fed to young girls, but no one is causing an uproar over Barbie!  No one ever expected the Tomb Raider game to become popular with girls; Lara Croft is what she is, a creation by guys for guys. Nothing more, nothing less. And if you really need it spelled out for you, guys have ever always been fascinated by large breasts and small waists. Whatever! I'm sure there's psychological crap being force-fed to impressionable young boys in this instance here too, but I'm sure every issue has been outlined and studied already since everyone in the world seems to have taken an issue with video games. As a woman, I'm not threatened by Lara's popularity, nor is her "hyper-sexualized" pixelated image a challenge to my female-ness. Why should I fly into a righteous rage? Who cares? It's a game. People play it to have fun. If it troubles you so, it's not for you; find another game to play or just unplug and walk away into the real world.   As for better avatar choices in RPGs...Well, I don't find the avatars in games that horrible to begin with. Then again the RPGs I play online are all text-based anyway so this "controversy" doesn't really matter to me. To me, the text-based RPGs are more fun to play; they leave more to the imagination and are more reminicent of the table-top RPG.   "The reality is that boys do play games more than girls do and, at some point, boys are buying more games than girls are," Trujillo said. "It's not that we're failing to tap into that audience because there aren't enough women on our end. It's just the nature of the industry and the product we're developing. It's like saying men would buy more makeup if more men were working in that industry."    Can't please everyone. Thankfully there are enough games out there that are interesting to play, regardless of whether or not they're "geared towards women".     : )

        So...    FoxNews is reporting online that most of NY has its power back on,  urlLink including Manhattan *...But WABC radio's John Gambling got cut off around 11:30 because the station's generators died and there wasn't any power available. I guess they fixed everything since Rush is on the air.   The LIRR and subways are still all messed up. Last I heard, NJ Transit is still doing 1 train per line every two hours into/out of Penn.   Power's spotty all in my area. The only thing I have plugged in right now (besides my radio and the comp) is the fridge and the freezer.   Yay for "surviving" the Blackout of '03.     * You know? That article focuses too much on the insanity/looting/rioting/etc during the '77 blackout...Ok great, but that was 26 years ago. This is a post 9-11 world, things are  obviously  different now. Shit happens. We're all just happy that it was only a power failure and not another horrible terrorist attack. Get over it and stop comparing the two; it's like comparing apples to motorcycles.

         urlLink Blogburst : Truth in the media     urlLink  John Burns: 'There Is Corruption in Our Business' - 'NY Times' Writer on the Terror of Baghdad    There were correspondents who thought it appropriate to seek the approbation of the people who governed their lives. This was the ministry of information, and particularly the director of the ministry. By taking him out for long candlelit dinners, plying him with sweet cakes, plying him with mobile phones at $600 each for members of his family, and giving bribes of thousands of dollars. Senior members of the information ministry took hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes from these television correspondents who then behaved as if they were in Belgium. They never mentioned the function of minders. Never mentioned terror.   In one case, a correspondent actually went to the Internet Center at the Al-Rashid Hotel and printed out copies of his and other people's stories -- mine included -- specifically in order to be able to show the difference between himself and the others. He wanted to show what a good boy he was compared to this enemy of the state. He was with a major American newspaper.      Insanity...

        On another note...    A friend of mine just let me know that the new $20 have finally been released. Finally. I remember  urlLink reading about this awhile back  but it never occurred to me that they would actually go  through  with this ridiculousness.   WHAT THE FUCK!? WHEN THE HELL DID I GET TRANSPORTED TO FUCKING EUROPE!?   urlLink Click here  to see the front of the bill -- We've got a tri-band gradient, going from green to yellow and back to green again. In the background on the left lies a blue eagle and on the right, repeating wavy text saying Twenty USA/USA Twenty.    urlLink Click here   to see the back of the bill -- It looks pretty normal and green....Except for the little yellow polkadots. I swear. YELLOW POLKADOTS!  (At least they look like little yellow polka dots on these complab monitors.)   This irks me to NO end. I like my "boring" green money; it's a significant part of America.  If you want to learn more about the new currency (just in case you forgot about it/never heard about it in the first place)  you can view the  urlLink interactive $20 bill  (which needs Flash) or you can  urlLink see the HTML version .  Meh. I  still  think it's ridiculous. New colors and integrated tech aside, I'm sure that someone out there is already hard at work making flawless counterfeits of the new currency. After all, they have had almost four months to prepare and get started.   I hope that once they find the damn counterfeits they give up on this stupidity and give me back my green money.    >:(

Blaargh! Bastards.   Ridiculous. Remind me to make friends with someone with a pair of heavy duty cable cutters so I can ask them to cut the damn cord that connects the amp to their stereo.

        Honey, can you crack open that bottle of Hitler?

Not that I don't blame them; using a  urlLink horrible man's image  to sell your wares is not the best way to conduct business. But hey, what do I know?

        I hope they find something    ...Because these gas prices are ridiculous!  urlLink Feds Probe Gas Price Surge    \According to the EIA, the highest prices were on the West Coast, where the average was $2.05 a gallon  with Californians paying $2.10. Drivers in New England were filling up at the price of $1.81 a gallon. The cheapest fuel in the country was in the petroleum-rich Gulf Coast region, where a gallon ran at $1.59.     Lucky New Englanders; my favorite gas station is currently at $1.85 and that's a new low for them these past two weeks.  They started at $1.61, shot up within three days of this first happening to $1.83, climbed up in increments to $1.93, stayed there for a while, went down to $1.91, stayed there for 2 days then climbed down in increments again to where it's at now: $1.87. That's for gas prices closest to my train station. Highest place I've seen so far is slightly closer to my residence and it's still holding at $1.99, as if the owners were to scared to actually trot out the $2.00 sign. It's closest competitors aren't tempting fate, so they're hovering around $1.96-$1.98; close enough to the max but a few cents less to attract customers. I'm sure the stations in Southampton have been over the $2 mark since they're traditionally anywhere from 10-25 cents ahead of my town and we're in the $1.95-$1.98 range.  This is ridiculous. You know what? Screw that ANWAR "save the cute fuzzy animals" campaign and lets start drilling for oil here at home. I want some gas in my tank that at the very least costs less than $1.25. Hell, I'll settle for gas that costs less than $1.50; anything over that is insanity. It shouldn't have to take a $20 to fill up my tank from the 1/4 full level.      Meh. :/

        I always loved Opus and Bill    So  urlLink Opus Returns  and all is well with the world again.   (Yes, I'm the hardcore Opus fan who used to always buy Opus & Bill cards for every occasion...Until they became hard to find. And that's probably more than you ever wanted to know about me...)     :D

        Behold, I shall do a new thing! (hats off to  urlLink Atom )      So I changed the layout of The Randomness to (hopefully) make everything more functional.   Links have moved to the bottom of the page.   Headings have been changed around a bit in order to accomodate all the extra bloglinks that I've accumulated on The Anomaly's blogroll.  Click on the headings to open the category and access the links.    If you don't want to be bothered with the new way of viewing the links, I have them all on one page for your pleasure:  urlLink LINKS GALORE!     If, for some reason the changes don't work for you, please let me know! My email's up there. Thanks!

        ...Just because I find it HILARIOUS!    Because of  urlLink the Onion article  (which I posted up on Sunday), Blogger  now  has an  urlLink official position  entitled: " urlLink What to do if your Mom discovers your blog... "  Hee!   (Again I am SO thankful my mother has no clue about this "internet" thing...She calls ALL of the internet "email". It's GREAT!!!)    >:D

        Damn.     urlLink Jonathan Brandis is dead  at 27. Apparent suicide.  It's sad to see someone so young dead by suicide. Why couldn't it have been one of the myriad of assholes that call Hollywood home? Why couldn't it have been Michael Jackson? At least the stupid freak would be dead and we wouldn't have to worry about him messing around with kids.   But no, it had to be this young guy. Dead at twenty-seven.  Damned.

        So...    I have until the end of this month to decide whether I want to continue with the hosting service I work with for  urlLink The Anomaly . If I decide 'yes', then I have to go through an affiliate. If I decide 'no', then...The Anomaly gets deleted and I'm not sure what I want to do after that. I can either look for another hosting service or let The Anomaly just fade away.    Either way, The Randomness will return to its original function as The Main Blog. Sound cool?    :D

      It looks like my webhost's servers are down on the Anomaly. Sorry guys. I guess that means I'll just have to start posting here once again and make the Randomness earn its keep.   Not much to report here for now besides the server outtage. I've been keeping busy offline so I've missed out on a few things here and there. (But hey, that's why I have a good list of hard-core bloggers for you to view in my absence...)  Life has been hectic but good. Had some imtrospective time to myself and worked some things out. I'm proud of my accomplishments so far and I'm looking forward towards the new goals I've set for myself. Even so, I'm still taking things one day at a time. This approach has been working pretty well for me and I'm happy with it.   I'm really looking forward to this upcoming BloggerBash; I'm going to miss the familiar faces who can't come anymore, but I think it will be nice to meet a few more bloggers whose writing I enjoy and admire. (As usual, I'll post pictures after the party...)  Well, that's a quick update on what's going on. I don't know when the Anomaly will get fixed, but I'll continue blogging here on the Randomness until it gets better.  Enjoy your night.

      I've been neglecting ALL of my blogs lately; offline life has been much better recently so I haven't been in front of the computer much. But I'm starting up again slowly but surely, so don't give up hope yet! Let's see, two dates pop into mind:    The 12th was the 2nd birthday of the Randomness, but I missed it. Oh well, there's always  next  year!   The 20th was the 1st anniversary of my Naturalization;  that  I celebrated with Nick over a steak-and-potato dinner...w00t!    I kind of like the fact that the Randomness is back in the shadows; that alone will probably help me write more here. Then again, since real life has a habit of taking control, who knows? Yay, real life.  Ah well. Stay tuned if you like and thanks for you patience...    : )

Three boys and a girl. Yay, young yuppies doing the hip thing. Makes me chuckle. Yet, they are oblivious to the world and oblivious to me laughing at them. Ah, youth.

      Blogger has a new layout/style/whatever to both its homepage and its control panel. Not quite sure I like it; it's too candy-coated sugery sweetness for me. It's like the default setting for XP; too damned cartoony.   Ick.  Also, I don't like the fact that I can't access each different blog from each other anymore; I rather liked the convenience of switching back-and-forth from the pulldown menu.   Grrrr. Don't like it and it's not growing on me. Oh well, at least bitching about it brought me out of my non-posting bit here AND it had the added effect of me actually trying to fix this broken machine and do something with it. Behold! A brand spankin' new layout (even though it's one of the prefabbed ones offered) with working links and everything! Hee.    Thank god for small miracles...Right?    ; )

      Pushing hard. Knowing nothing but the next placement of step, the next breath taken. Feeling the strain of muscle, each quiver a threat to give out, to collapse on the floor.  Only strength of will keeping you on your feet making your legs continue. Seeing everyone around you and yet seeing nothing at all. Hearing only thunder as heart pumps blood, the whoosh as lungs work for each breath taken.  I've passed that threshold.  I've overrun that line.  My leg fails me and I stumble. I refuse to be broken that easily. My lungs fail me, but in time that will be corrected.  Soon, soon... My head knows I've made progress My heart regains hope.   I will not fail.

      Everyone has their little sanctuary, a place where they can run to and turn off the world for awhile. Maybe it's a popular place, teeming with people; either friends to talk to or strangers milling about in the background like white noise. Or maybe it's a secluded place, away from the world where you can just get lost in your thoughts.  I once had a place where I could run to, but it's dead now. Nothing but memories.  I have no destination anymore, so I revel in my journey...75 miles down the highway, front windows and moonroof open whipping my hair all over the place and annoying the hell out of me even as I listen to my music and try to pretend I'm in a car commercial. I purposely get lost and find my way back home again. I listen to the radio until it depresses me; then I hit CD and turn the volume up to setting 25 and attempt to decipher what song is playing since the howling wind demands my attention. I pray to the gods of travel to keep myself safe and out of trouble.  I guess it's time to roam again but I have no place to go. No safe haven for me to run to anymore.   I just don't feel welcome in the places that are supposed to be for sitting and chatting and whatnot. I hate such places; the atmosphere and the surrounding environment just doesn't jive with me, but I make do. The company I keep alone makes it worthwhile. But I guess my distaste with the environment overall is just a reflection of myself; a mirror to what, after all this time, I finally had the courage to admit to myself.   So I wander, not quite lost, but still without a destination.  A friend of mine once told me that life is not about reaching the destination, it's about the journey. It doesn't matter  where  you end up or  when  you get there; it's about who's coming along with you for the ride.   Yeah.

      Rain.   I think this is the first time I'm really minding the rain. I could have used a little sunshine today. However, sometimes these things just don't seem to work out. I guess that's become the mantra of now.   Sometimes these things just don't seem to work out.  I look back and I see how far I've gone. I look to my side and enjoy the people who accompany me. I look ahead...  And that's where I go blind.   I know I have a lot of shit to work through. Who doesn't? It gets to me though. After all this hard work to try to fix myself, it just takes a few small incidents, a few small comments, to rip through the stitches that were finally in place and leave me right back where I started. Right back at square one. Not that these incidents are anything large, mind you, but they are worrisome and  just enough  to show me that no matter how hard I try, some of my faults will always stay with me.   I guess it's just nature's way of saying, whatever, you're flawed, get used to the idea. I just hate getting it rubbed in my face. I have the legacy of my mother inside me which pisses me off, that whole attitude of, "Well, you tried your best but your best wasn't good enough. Too bad. Now you try, try again. One day you'll get it right. Until then, you're useless."  Stupid rain.   Maybe I should unplug. Permanently. The things I see when the cable allows me to connect disturbs me. I  hate  the idea of living in blissful ignorance, but maybe just once it would be nice to live like that. Then again, it wouldn't truly be blissful ignorance, now would it? Because I would  know  what went on and speculate just how bad it's getting now.  Damned.  My best wasn't good enough. Too bad. Now I'll try, try again because one day I'll get it right.   Until then...  I'm going to show you just how fucking useful I am. Bitch.    *  Thank you, Henry Rollins

       urlLink    I love those daily fortunes; they're so silly, I just can't help but crack up each day.   Blogging has been cut down to a minimum since my cable modem just doesn't want to agree with me. It's working in fits and starts and I have no idea just how long the connection will last each time. (Sorry John. Think you can lend me a sledgehammer?) Honestly though, I think I'm ok with this though. I have a new toy to play with:   urlLink     Yes, I caved in and got one; those commercials broke me. Seeing the old-skool keypad design brought all those memories flooding back to me. And then, at that critical momentary loss of my spine I saw something awesome...IT HAS THE ORIGINAL MARIO BROS!?  Holy crap! THE ORIGINAL MARIO BROS!! You mean I can finally beat that goddamned game once and for all!? I MUST HAVE THIS THING!  So I indulged my inner child and bought her the old-skool "retro-designed" gameboy, complete with Tetris Worlds (since I can't find the my original gameboy with its Tetris  anywhere ...Still think it's in that damned piano bench) and...of course...Mario Bros.  Whee.  Yes, that's all I have to say:   whee !  So my dears, I'm sorry about the cable modem business, but unfortunately that's out of my hands. However, when this damn thing finally does get fixed, I might not be around since, well, Princess Peach will finally be saved.   After 14 years. Ish.

      This is what I found today on my personalized MyWay homepage underneath the " urlLink Daily Motivator " section:   Experience life   The worst thing that can happen is nothing. Though there is a risk of failure in any undertaking, there is a certainty of failure when you never even make the attempt.   Each time you get hurt, each time you fall short of the mark, you add another excuse to your arsenal. But excuses won't bring anything of value to your life. They only make you more skilled at avoiding the abundant goodness that life has to offer.   Forget the excuses. Stop worrying about failure. Life is yours to be lived. You'll gain nothing by hiding from it. The cold wind on your face may sting a little bit, yet it lets you know you're alive.   Fill each moment with new experiences. Fill each day with effort directed toward a meaningful purpose. It sure beats hiding in the corner. Though you'll occasionally stumble, you'll be stumbling forward, and enjoying the abundant experience of being alive.    Oh, HELL YEAH!!!     : )

      Stolen off of  urlLink Dick :   1. Do you try to look hot when you go to the grocery store just in case someone recognizes you from your blog?  Hah!  Riiiiiight.    2. Are the photos you post Photoshopped or otherwise altered?   Nah, the only thing really done to them in Photoshop is resizing them. Unless you really want to try to load a 2560 x 1920 sized picture on this website...   3. Do you like it when creeps or dorks email you?   Creeps? No. Makes me want to bash their skulls in with my hammer. Dorks? Dorks I have no problem with, but I really prefer geeks. ; )   4. Do you lie in your blog?   Nope. What would I gain from it? Absolutely nothing.  5. Are you passive-aggressive in your blog?   Maybe? I'm violent by nature, but I have to keep it under wraps in real life.    6. Do you ever threaten to quit writing so people will tell you not to stop?   Hah. No one would be beating down my virtual door to get me to come back. I'm ok with that.    7. Are you in therapy? If not, should you be? If so, is it helping?   What are you talking about? This IS my therapy! Heh.   8. Do you delete mean comments? Do you fake nice ones?  I delete spam comments. Sometimes I delete mean comments if they have nothing to do with the post. The few mean-but-on-topic comments I get, I leave it up and poke fun at the poster. The way I figure it, I must be coming up in the world if I get trolls.   9. Have you ever rubbed one out while reading a blog? How about after?   Nani?   10. If your readers knew you in person, would they like you more or like you less?   I don't know. Why don't we ask them after they meet me?   11. Do you have a job?  Sure.    12. If someone offered you a decent salary to blog full-time without restrictions, would you do it?   Sure!   13. Which blogger do you want to meet in real life?   If we're talking "famous", Steven den Beste; he's the one who got me started in the first place. (Bet you didn't know that did you?) As for "normal" bloggers, Adam the  urlLink hondakid .   14. Which bloggers have you made out with?  Well, my  urlLink boyfriend  blogs... :D   15. Do you usually act like you have more money or less money than you really have?   Huh?    16. Does your family read your blog?   Nope. They're still stuck on calling the entirety of the internet, "email".    17. How old is your blog?   Which one are you talking about? lol    18. Do you get more than 1000 page views per day? Do you care?   Page views or hits? Heh, nah, I have no idea. I just check my stats to see who's referring me. Sometimes I wonder how the hell people get to my site via some of these other sites; I don't see any "blogsnob" links on them or any reciprocal links, so I wonder. After that, I love seeing the random Googled phrases that bring people to my blog...   19. Do you have another secret blog in which you write about being depressed, slutty, or a liar?   Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be secret now would it?   20. Have you ever given another blogger money for his/her writing?   Yeap, once. Bought a shirt!   21. Do you report the money you earn from your blog on your taxes?   Wait, you can  actually make money  off of your blog!? WHAAAAT?! Why wasn't I told!? I MISSED THE MEMO!!!!  DAMNIT!!! *ahem*  So, uhhhh, want to send me a few bucks via PayPal?    22. Is blogging narcissistic?   Inherently so, but who cares? I'd be doing this anyway.    23. Do you feel guilty when you don't post for a long time?   Heh, look at all my apologetic posts after I've wandered offline for awhile and decide.    24. Do you like John Mayer?   Nani?   25. Do you have enemies?   Sure I do. (And I've got my eye on you all.)   26. Are you lonely?   Nope!    27. Why bother?   Why indeed? Who cares. Just chug along with the rest of us and you'll be fine.      : )

      Ever hear Daniel Bedingfield's "Friday"? Yeah, it's one of those songs that's so frenetic, you have to sit down and catch your breath at the end of it for the poor guy. I've got my WinAmp on random; funny how it chose to follow such a fast-paced song with Spider Nick and the Maddogs' "You Belong To Me". That has got to be the most laid-back song I've ever heard in my life.   ...Why do I have the feeling today will be odd?    XD

       urlLink    " Mother is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all children... " --J. O'Barr,  The Crow   My Olympus' battery decided to die on me so I had to requisition my father's Nikon Digital SLR. She is more beautiful and majestic over my lake, Her light illuminating the cloud patters in the sky; reminds me of the patterns waves make on the beach when the tide goes out.  So sorry you cannot see what I see in the sky tonight, but I thought I'd try and share it with you anyway...

       urlLink    A long time ago I had access to one of the versions of Bryce. I can't for the life of me remember which one it was. (If it works and you can see the graphic...) This landscape was called "Sunset of Hell". No, I don't remember why I named it that way, I guess it was my angsty teenaged cynicism showing through. Anyway, just wanted to share and test out Hello some more.

      Because it  urlLink doesn't take much  to amuse me:  " Ravenwolf  from this day forward you will also be known as  Dynamic Lover ."  And if I make it into a first and last name combination:  " Raven Wolf  from this day forward you will also be known as  Happy Desperado ."  Both suit me just fine.   ; )

      I wrote this in a thread on the Off-Topic section of a forum. If you missed my post over on  urlLink the Anomaly , this is pretty much like it. Again...Thank you.    To all the Fallen in the past who gave their lives in order for me to be able to grow up in America, call her my home and be free...  To all the Fallen in the present who are giving their lives to protect me, my family and friends...  To all the families of the Fallen because only they truly know the great sacrifices...  To all the vets who are alive and are able to tell their stories to those of us who weren't in the front lines...  And to all the people currently serving, because there's no time like the present (and memorials are only held for the dead and that is far too late in my opinion)...  Thank you. Those two words will never be enough, but I still want to say them.    Thank you.       -.-

      You know? I love and respect this band, totally, utterly and completely. Why? I've only seen them live twice; once at the Brickhouse Brewery last year and just now for the past three hours at Borders.  They played their hearts out and rocked Borders just as hard as they did last year playing at the bar.  Yeah.  Much love and respect to this talented band!  ( Go check them out right this damn second at  urlLink Spider Nick and the Maddogs  and support awesome music! )

      There was more to my previous post; it was&nbsp;originally a&nbsp;draft detailing the exact events and how they unfolded. However, I've decided not to post that long-winded draft. I'm going to talk to the three people in the administration of my school whom I trust and then I'm going to continue on in the class.   The way I figure it, I've learned my lesson. They both took me by surprise and caught me off-guard. I will never make the same mistake again. I learn quickly from my mistakes.   That, and I only have to deal with this professor for the rest of this semester. After this is over, I'll be going on to bigger and better things while she will still be a 40-something&nbsp;embittered professor trying to elevate her ego by attempting to bring down the students around her who dare to think differently.   I think I'm on the winning side.

      For the first time in my 24 years of life on this planet, today&nbsp;I have faced:   Discrimination  The&nbsp;questioning my ethnic background  The belittling of my intelligence  Being told that my life is easy because I can "pass"   This was at the hands of two self-proclaimed Liberal Democrats; one a white professor, the other a black student and both were female.   Thanks, you two.&nbsp;At least now I know how to deal with it. Chalk it up to a lesson learned; I'll never make the same mistake again.    &nbsp;

      So.   I am starting to understand this C++ thing and I'm ok with the professor. However, I'm beginning to hate one my classmates.   Well, let me rephrase that last sentence; I  already hate  one of my classmates.   The professor was explaining how C++ is good for higher mathematical calculations; however, we wouldn't really be using all the functions since we weren't ready for it yet. The kid next to me just  explodes  into a fit of cackling laughter and then comes out with: "Well, I'm glad that  someone  doubts my mathematical abilities." And then he proceeds to argue with the professor because, in his own (limited) experience with higher math, he believes that there are other, better languages out there that can deal with such things, since, "after all, I took Calculus III in my previous college and was a Math Major".   And then the professor gives this uppity shithead a nice verbal smackdown. I can't even go into it because it was just so eloquent...And it shut this kid up quick.  Ahh, the power of C++.   ...And hatred.

      So, I spoke to the Dean about what transpired on that day, and he gave me some advice on how to proceed. I'm going to stay in the class and force her to face me every class session while continuing to participate and earn my grades. The way I figure it, that whole incident was a learning experience.  However , if anything else happens, I will file a grievance, state my case, and bring in both an impartial classmate as well as the Dean to bear witness on my account during the case.   So we'll just see how this goes.   After all, I've got some points in my favor: 1.) I only have to put up with her until the end of the semester 2.) She has freely admitted that she has a few strikes against her within her record in the school 3.) When all is said and done, she will still only be a teacher while I'll continue on with my life.   Personally, I think #3 is the most important reason of all.     : )
