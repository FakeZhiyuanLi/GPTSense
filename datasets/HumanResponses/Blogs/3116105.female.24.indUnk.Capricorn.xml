      Hey UH-GNAW-KNEE-MOOS  .... can I shorten your name to UGKM?  If you post by signing A? How will we know who the real UGKM is?  Any Anonymous bloak could come pretend to be you even though you aren't really any identity... you could quickly get a really bad identity....  so if its agreeable to you, perhaps those posting and reading right now can come to know you as UGKM. (Of course I guess that means now you have an identity?) What a condundrum. Glad your here.  In fact, I think I'll change my identity while I'm at it.  From now on I'd like to be just "B".  Anyone want to be "C"?  TTFN - B.

      Has anyone else seen   Man on Fire  ? I saw it on a Sunday afternoon--a time when my emotions are typically raw. Everything about the movie was cliche except . . . why was this burned out, alcoholic, ex-CIA able to quote Scripture and why did he read the Bible? Who put that in the script? Why?  Something got stirred in me and I felt sad, like I was watching my own life through a window. A moment came when God said to me, "Pay attention to this!" I knew that the next couple of lines were going to be really important, so I listened carefully. One of the odd characters in the movie spoke a sentence that was God's message to me. I was bowled over, and so thankful that God would let me be there, alert me to the fact that something was coming, then hit my heart with a message He had been working in me for several weeks.  Want to know what it was?

      "When I saw others straining toward God, I did not understand it, for though I may have had him less than they did, there was no one blocking the way between him and me, and I could reach his heart easily. It is up to him, after all, to have us, our part consists of almost solely in letting him grasp us." -Rilke and Benvenuta: an Intimate Correspondence

      Below is a teaser to the article you may want to check out (click the "Link" above).  I've never been really interested in trying to wrap my brain around how science proves or disproves the existence of God.  I am completely mystified still by the whole concept of radio in my car.... so this article mostly just furthered my belief in the mystery of God.  Yet somehow it helped my logical thinking understand the co-existence of our Free Will and God's Predestination.  I am interested in hearing if anyone else knows this stuff or cares or already gets it..... whatever.  I feel more enlightened but I also feel like it's worth checking out....  The teaser to the article on the link.......  We're talking about the ancient smackdown between God's resolute, unchallenged predetermination of all things and, on the other hand, humankind's unfettered right to choose our own destiny. In one corner stands God's ultimate prerogative to rule; in the other, man's primal birthright as a free-agent.  But here, in little more than the time it'd take you to delete the spam in your inbox, you will encounter a mesmerizing synthesis of science and philosophy that will forever change the way you look at the universe.

      After digesting the discussion on saturday I thought that I would give my perspective on the topic clip.  When I first saw the Animatrix, Matriculated jumped out as something that was just ripe with Immersion-style content.  In fact I felt that the clip was a handy metaphor for the Immersion dynamic.  The first important factor which may not have been made absolutely clear in the selection itself was the setting.  Being that it takes place in the world of The Matrix, the machines and the humans are in a state of war.  Those humans we saw in the clip were only in their position after having escaped imprisonment by the machines.  They all had existed in a world that was FORCED upon them by the machines in order to keep them enslaved.  Even with this in mind they still choose to try to create a dialouge with their mechanical counterparts as a means of creating resolve.  The basic form of interaction between the human and the machine is to seek to kill the other for their own survival.  The idea that this small renegade band is struggling to find peace in the midst of such chaos was a worthwhile discussion in and of itself.  We the viewer witness one encounter between these humans and a pair of scouting machines.  It is implied that the machines are scouting for the purpose of eradicating the humans (the transmitter being placed to summon reinforcements).  When the humans gain the upper hand, they manage to take one of the invaders hostage (with the help of a machine fighting and giving its life on the side of the human cause).  This begins our focal point for the story.  What follows is an attempt on the part of the humans to communicate with (not reprogram) the machine mind.    The director specifically states in an interview that the method used was that of the human dream state.  He also clarifies that the machine represents a 'rigid mind', an unbending mentality rather than simply a 'robot'.   The protagonists of the story had to create a common ground in order to inact a constructive dialouge.  They had to envision a 'language' which they could use to reach those who would seek to destroy them.  The war metaphors being used here are to exagerate the problem at hand.  How do we communicate with someone/thing different from ourselves?  They make the point that coersion is ultimately useless because to force is just another way to destroy.  If they can find a common ground with the machines, only then will there be hope for peace.   The peice is concluded with a very important image.  It is the machine waiting on the shoreline in same place where it first encountered the woman in the beginning.  To me this was the most telling part.  After all was finished, and everyone on both sides lay dead, this lone machine carried on the same vigil of the humans he had destroyed.  There can be no more certain way to show the decision made by that machine.  No one was left to pressure, coerce, threaten or controll him and he still chose to wait on that beach to show the next one the things he had learned.  I thought this was so applicable because as christians we fall into the same patterns.  We tend to try and fight or reprogram those who believe differently than us rather than find a common ground and share experiences in order to communicate and find peace.

      Today I was having a conversation with a co-worker when I had what I call a "spiritual experience".  The content of the conversation is not important. But the experience was.  While I was speaking to her I began to visualize a spider landing on her and spinning a web. The spider deposits its first blob of sticky threadlike filaments and begins going from post to post to deposit additional blobs of sticky webbing until ultimately the spider has spun a complete web and is satisfied that its web is perfect for ensnaring the food required to sustain its life.   What I saw in that picture was how my conversation was like that.  I engage in conversation with someone and it deposits a sticky residue of me on their soul. That person goes from post to post depositing parts of that conversation, each time creating a stronger more viable web structure.... but for what?  What is the web for... ensnaring what?   I feel the web can represent two things: it can ensnare and kill its prey. Our conversations with people can indeed ensnare and kill people - their passions, dreams, hopes, trust, freedom... etcc.   But I also feel the web ensnares to fortify the life of the spider.  And so too our conversations with one another can fortify, nourish, edify the life of others.   What I also got from this experience is that my relationship with God is alot like this.  He deposits these sticky filaments in my life that represent a time when He connected with me for a "purpose" and then as I go to and fro, from post to post trying to figure out this purpose, the web is spun..... when the web is completed: I am either at the end of myself and surrendered to the outcome like the spider's prey -  OR I am like the spider, sustained and fortified until it's time to begin another web.     Anybody else feel like a spider?

      Check out Brian's link. He is going to be with Immersion on Saturday June 19th and the 26th as host for the evening. He has a wealth of knowledge we need to glean and be challenged with.  Also, below is the link to his book recommendations.... some of them look really interesting for me, I thought you might like to check out what the emerging church leaders are reading to inspire their passion.  http://www.anewkindofchristian.com/recommendations.html

      I was just wondering, if Vegan's are pro-life... meaning "for all living creatures", which is why they don't eat things that were alive at some point.  What do they think about "meat-o-sauras" animals.  Ya know, animals that prey and feed on other animals?   And.... do they have pets?  Cuz if they had like a dog or a cat, what do they feed them? Simulated protein... cuz most of the cat/dog food I see in the markets has meat byproduct in it. And if it is simulated protein, isn't that kind of unfair to the dog/cat to put their "vegan" lifestyle on their pet. I mean, it's not like God gave the dog/cat a brain to be able to decide whether or not it was cruel for them to eat other animals... it's just their created nature to do so.  I'm just curious about this...  anybody know any Vegan's?  P.S.  Are Vegan's against abortion then?  Hmmmmm.

      Dear Neohippie  I wasn't there last Saturday night so maybe commenting is out of line, but here goes anyway.  O.K. I get that your pissed off. I'm not clear at who, what or why?  1. Are you angry that in a theoretical exercise on how to best spend 50 billion dollars to solve the worlds problems someone came up with the     lame idea of translating bibles into different languages? 2. Are you angry that some christians are still in favor of evangelism? 3. Are you angry that in an experimental evening the format required small group activity? 4. Are you angry that well fed christian missionaries risk their lives by going into third world countries to torture starving children with meatball subs? 5. Are you angry that you argued with your mom and you think she is disappointed in you?  Seems to me getting angry about children dying, human suffering and injustice in the world is an admirable quality.  How would Jesus spend 50 billion dollars? Hmm... My guess is he would give to Caesar what was Caesar's.  My question to you neohippie is how can you make a difference in a world of need?

      Okay, so after digesting our most recent (and very weird) Immersion session, I wanted to blog something.  Isn't it interesting how, depending on the group of people we're with, we seem to shift back and forth between being "conservative Christians" to being no-good-dirty-hippie-liberal-heretical beatniks. Hmm. It seems as though we all had someone in our small groups (did I mention I hate small groups?) that really believed the best way to spend 50 billion dollars was to translate bibles into every language and then set forth into the world converting people, in hopes that before the poverty-stricken, homeless, starving, 3rd world peoples of our globe  DIE , we can convert them to Christianity. HMM. So.... Okay, I get it. We should also make sure that the money is spent nourishing the good Christian missionaries who do this, so that they are healthy and fed and physically ready to take on this task. THEN, when they get there, they can dangle their foot-long meatball sub in front of bloated ethiopian children and tell them that if they promise to believe in Jesus, they'll get a sandwich!!   Wha? Alright, so I  don't  get it. I argued with my mother about this when I explained the service (and the aftermath) to her. I often argue with my mother about Immersion. She's disappointed in me because I'm into all this "new-age crap."  Isn't a better example of God to care for the needy without putting requirements on it? To love unconditionally? Wouldn't it represent our Most High God BEST if we let our beliefs shine through our actions? I'm not saying we should never mention Jesus or pretend that we're something we're not. But wouldn't someone who hasn't eaten in weeks and sleeps in the mud rather see random foreign people giving away food, clothing, medicines instead of listening to strangers preach at them about a God they've never heard of? Look how pretty our God is... he has blond hair and blue eyes and speaks with a lovely british accent.  But then, I guess that's just me JUDGING these other Christians. Now its someone's turn to judge me for judging them. Then I can judge you back for judging me for judging them.  What would Jesus do with 50 Billion dollars?  neohippie

      I was sitting with my thoughts one day, thinking about some of the different paths I visited and these thoughts started rolling something like this...  What would you say if today was the day that you didn't see tomorrow? Where would you go?   How do you know?     Who would you see?       Did he hang from a tree? Some people say there's a shiny white light up at the end of a tunnel. Now let me see the opposite would be getting sucked down a black funnel. Others have said your tied to a thread, your going to get recycled. A princess   A queen     A jellybean? You can't really mean things that aren't seen, go and get you frightened. Orange and red, a Lama once said "time to get enlightened". Follow your bliss was really a miss, addictions get real boring. Try follow your fear, for it draws you nearer to the lessons that are adoring. Nirvana was the scene, if you know what I mean. His music led to disaster. Don't waste your time standing on a life line, shortcuts are always faster. If you are cool, yogas the rule, stretching isn't traggic. Be a goddess instead but don't lose your head, witchcraft is really magic. The prince of thieves is disquised as these, laughing all the way to the bank. All you must do is get a clue, assurance is what you seek. I know there are times, TBN signs, people that look like freaks. Don't be misled, the book should be read, the contents may surprise you. It speaks of a man, who walked the land, parables were his bag baby. The headlines read, 5000 fed, he rose the dead, he also said," I am the way, the truth, and the life". With his healing touch, lepers lost there spots, the blind were made to see. The message was clear for all to hear, he'd come to set us free. The court of the day, in a media way, just like today, had their way.   They said that he lied.     Let him be crucified!       Hammers fell,         pungent smells,           crimson tears fell on deaf ears.              They pierced his side.                 He let out a cry. Forgive them Father, for it was no bother, I'd do it again to save all men. My blood on the cross, was no loss, it has set things straight. In three short days, I'll stand at the gate and wait. Now that you know, will you go with the flow? Take the time to bust a ryhme. Or won't you please,    fall to your knees,      and take hold of the hand,       the hand of the man,         the Holy Lamb of Galilee.

      I have an idea that when longblogs (I mean it as one word) show up ... like the last one of mine,  Emergence-y!  ... some people may take it as though the writer's intent was, "Well! That about sums it up. No more to be said. (And don't even try, please.)"  Even if that were so (it shouldn't be), I hope everyone would see  any  posting as never really "done," more like an opportunity for thought and reflection, tasting and sampling; if it's a long post, then it can be a buffet table, a sort of smorgasblog where you can select any little tidbit that strikes your taste. Maybe none of it; maybe only one word or turn of phrase, or a single illustration.  But you can add to the thoughts, as many do, and surely you have insights that no one else has. A painting is always more than the artist intends, music more than the composer or musicians express, words more than writer may think is being said. One person may offer some thoughts;  you  have opportunity and insight to open any of those and take others still deeper, a door whose inside is bigger than the outside.  Is it about who has the last word? Maybe it's that  no one  has the last word, there's always more to explore and express. If I go on for pages, you could take the smallest phrase and open it for others to your own insights, wider and deeper than all of it together!  the well's mouth is small, the ocean's face so endless. but how deep? immerse.  ---seussac

      Here is a story review that might spark some interest:   "Hell is the Absence of God," on the other hand, is very much an attempt to examine the idea of faith, specifically by imagining a situation in which faith is no longer a part of religion. In our world, religion relies on faith because definitive proof is lacking. This lack of proof allows some people to reject one religion and choose another based on which makes them feel better, e.g. "I don't like the judgemental god of Religion A, so I'm going to worship the kind and gentle god of Religion B." We have that option because neither deity is unambiguously present, but if a particular god were here right now, we'd have to deal with him whether we liked him or not; faith would have nothing to do with it. I thought that would be an interesting scenario to explore.

      We talk about the "emergent" church: it might be worth thinking about that  emerge  itself derives from "to come forth from  immersion "---which resonates delightfully, and as I&nbsp;see&nbsp;it,&nbsp;even in a kind of&nbsp;providential artistry, with this group's name. Was that thought of when the name was chosen?&nbsp;We go in, I hope to see people emerge as something newer than when&nbsp;we came.  Before about 1425,  emergent  also referred to the year of the Israelite exodus---and I hope that many people here&nbsp;are also finding their own exodus into clearer perspectives of God, themselves,&nbsp;and one another. (Hopefully without plagues of flies and such. The incense might help keep them away.)&nbsp;On the other hand, an  emergence  can refer to a plant outgrowth such as a thorn. The question there is: Whose side are we in (not "on")?&nbsp;(And are we maybe  supposed  to be there!)  And even the alarming word  emergency  began simply as referring to an  unforeseen circumstance--- but like so much else in life, maybe really not so unforeseen, if only we had recognized how a genuinely normal part of life is that much often comes from little. A seed somehow ends up as Jack's giant beanstalk (or a giant redwood); water, air, heat, and a spin from the Earth are all that make up our endlessly complex weather.  John Holland's fascinating book,  Emergence: From chaos to order,  is a marvelous adventure in that kind of complexity---the&nbsp;notion of much coming from little, of systems "where the behavior of the whole is much more complex than the behavior of the parts," and where "the deeper explanation, once understood, inevitably gives the imagination an exhilarating boost." Which would be good to have in understanding our own lives!&nbsp;Things we might puzzle over as confusing---the sprawl of a rain forest or a city, the churn of traffic or just of our own lives---can take on a whole new perspective,&nbsp;with even an exhilarating jolt of recognition,&nbsp;once we step back to see order emerging&nbsp;from confusion.  Which, it might&nbsp;seem, is&nbsp;easier to see in a rain forest than in our own&nbsp;(or others') lives---until we also step back to see the potential in each person's life. There is a fresh view of that&nbsp;by Roger Lewin and Birute Regine, in their book with the really long title,  The Soul at Work: Listen ... Respond ... Let Go: Embracing complexity science for business success.  Once you get past that, and the maybe drab sound of "business," they&nbsp;have a&nbsp;refreshing view of creative potential in  any  groups, drawing on observations of animal groups, such as a flock of birds. "The complex behavior of the system as a whole---the coordinated motion of the flock---emerges from a few simple rules of interaction among individuals, not from a single leader."  So what&nbsp;about all this? So they conclude by thinking about  emergent teams;  see for yourself how this sounds, considering what we've hoped to&nbsp;do in Immersion: "In emergent teams, everyone jumps into action; everyone intuitively knows what needs to be done; different people guide the collective action at different times ... and it's all done in the spirit of goodwill and care. And the results are often beyond the imagined .... This capacity in people, and in teams, to [break] through the normal day-to-day structures is the soul at work." Actively including diversity, especially diversity in ideas; openness for people to contribute and have a say; the central need for caring relationships; the importance of story in building understanding and trust---these are some of&nbsp;their pictures of&nbsp;how&nbsp;this idea looks in action, how complexity emerges from individuals' gifts.  And this sounds a lot like what I hear people hoping for (and often practicing) in Immersion. If any of this sounds like what you've wanted to do, or see, or be a part of, I hope you dive in and add your part, because no one can tell how important your part is until it's in the mix; and it takes  all  these unique lives for us to see how the whole design will emerge. The whole is very much greater, richer, deeper, more complex,&nbsp;than the sum of the parts.&nbsp;Lewin and Regine were told,&nbsp;with regard to teams, "If someone asks who the leader is, then that person has never been on a good team." What's important in this "team"? Look around: you're immersed in it.

      During the modern era, "story" as a form of communication was minimized as compared to "report," "essay," "argument," and "documentation." Intelligent people seemed to assume that if you wanted to entertain, then tell a story, but if you wanted to get at the facts, you should present an argument. Therefore a scientific report that was well-researched was a better medium for communicating truth than a story. &nbsp; The modern assumption has been challenged in the last two or three decades. We realize now that a good story (that is, one that obeys the rules established by the story world and genre--fairytale, sci-fi, murder mystery, etc.) can contain and communicate truth as well as any other form of communication. In fact, many scholars (including cognitive scientists) believe that "story" is necessary for human thinking, for ordering our worlds, and for forming a rational and coherent mental map. We need stories to&nbsp;make sense out of the events and circumstances of our lives. Stories help us figure out how everything "fits." &nbsp; I've been reading N. T. Wright's,  The New Testament and the People of God  (and loving it!). Here's a quote: "Stories are a basic constituent of human life; they are, in fact, one key element within the total construction of a worldview."  &nbsp; I don't know how to fully articulate this yet or explain why it is so, but I can feel its truth. My worldview is my total story, my explanation of reality. &nbsp; obg

      How did you first hear of Immersion (Saturday night meetings/community)? When did you decide you wanted to be part of it? What does it mean to you? What do you look forward to when you go? What do you dread? &nbsp; This Saturday night we want to think about the Immersion narrative. In a way, it is many different narratives, because we all have different stories. But what is the one common story that holds us together? Granted, we are now writing the first chapter, but still something is beginning to emerge. We love each other, enjoy being together, and sometimes even find as much fun and benefit from the things that fail as the things that succeed. &nbsp; If you have a story, email it to me or else respond to this blog. It would be really nice if I heard from you by this evening (Friday, or tomorrow morning at the latest). &nbsp; Thanks! &nbsp; obg

      "There is no use trying," said Alice. "One can't believe impossible things." "I daresay you haven't had much practice," said the Queen. "When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." --Lewis Carroll,  Through the Looking Glass   Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

      dominic just emailed me your emails about Saturday night's topic of sin.  i was gonna email back but got a little scared i was gonna be a perpetrator of an email flurry.  so i'm putting my response here, my virtual saturday night replacement until my show closes (blatant plug: if you didn't see Dominic direct my play "Evolution of Sunday" in OC, come up to LA and see the LA version!  urlLink www.splitid.com . it's about god and guilt and stuff. buy tickets at  urlLink www.lastagealliance.com  or tell the house manager that night that you're from Immersion and I'll have a comp ticket for you.)  Okay, back to topic....  Here was my e-mail and two cents....  I so wish I was there! Sin is my favorite topic!  How funny that I was trying to find the term for sin that other religions use and all I could think of was Buddhism and I guess it'd be "suffering" and wasn't even thinking about the Rohr quote.  I remember a philosophy class where we debated sin vs evil and this class had every kind of religion. It was impressive how the non-Christians felt so much more comfortable about the topic than the Christians. Maybe because there's no spiritual investment in the term. No baggage? Either way, it certainly added clarity for those who called ourselves Christians.  I heard someone say that they thought of a person's spiritual journey as a straight path with a light up ahead. And if you keep your eye on the light and keep walking, it's all you can do..it's all you need to do. It's really all God needs to help you get to heaven/nirvana/bliss/happiness/etc. Keep your eye on God, move forward, and the rest is taken care of.  So on occassion, you're on the road and you stumble. But you keep walking. That's a sin. You tripped. You hit a little pothole on the road where your eyes weren't on God, your eyes were on the ground watching the dirt meet your face. And the result can be a skinned knee or a broken foot, but either way, you heal and the only one you hurt is yourself.  On that note, evil was walking on that path and making a conscious decision to take your eyes off God, turn around, and walk the other direction.  I think we're sometimes afraid God won't know if we're tripping or walking the opposite direction. We think sin is gonna put us on the judgement list. And judgement is for evil. Judgement is for the person who doesn't want to be on the journey. Most (everything?) Jesus talks about when he talks about wrongdoers is about intent. So much of his teachings were "They do this, but their hearts..." It's about where your facing, not what you're doing.  (personal belief is I think hell is the life you lead with your back to the light).  So anyway, as a Christian, I often get confused and think, "If I trip, God will see it as me intending to leave Him. But really, I just didn't know I was gonna trip. It took me by surprise. But God won't understand! I was on my butt! I meant to be on my feet! How can I tell God I didn't mean to!"  And that's just silly. Since God is rumored to be fairly smart.
