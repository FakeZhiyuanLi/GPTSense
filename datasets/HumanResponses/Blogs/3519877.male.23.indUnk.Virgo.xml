        urlLink    Here she is. Get a good look, but believe that it never lasts as long as you want it to. I have never known anyone that could make the distance to the sun seem like an inch compared to how far she can look into me with her eyes. Those two brilliant dark chocolate spheres erase everything peripheral when they are aimed at you. I may have lost her once but I see her everyday. She makes the best friend and I don't think I have ever had it better with her.

       I ws running in the afternoon sun a few weeks ago, or maybe it was a few days. Through  urlLink Kalamazoo's  downtown, past the myriad postmodernantipoetic bars and through  urlLink Pfizer's  industrial section, taking the turn at the liquor store with the huge paintings of childlike heads in the window and past the soccer fields. A few hispanic adolescents, maybe three, were kneeling by the goalposts, praying. I don't know what they were praying for or if they were praying at all. I remember the sun being hot and dry and beat down on the field like a baker hitting  urlLink pizza  dough. I remember breathing throughout my entire body, every single pore, by then. I remember being sweaty and alive. This was the moment for the soccer players. They were pouring their hearts out to something over a single match. They wore no uniforms. I don't even remember seeing a ball but they had the determination of a  urlLink sledgehammer  in mid swing. 
Was there something so important about their next match that these young men were asking for divine assistance like some do before going off to  urlLink certain death  in war? Or was this intense concentration and communication with something bigger than them more mundane. Perhaps they pray with the same unwavering vigor before thay eat a bowl of Cheerios or a ham sandwich. 
No, that couldn't be. 
And there I was running for my own health, sweating profusely, breathing in more air than I probbaly deserved. For what? For my own benefit; a literal exercise in vanity. I was being greedier and more selfish than an  urlLink Enron executive  while these young men were probably beating themselves up three times as much for something they believed in.
Striving for excellence will bring you motivation but striving for perfection will bring you crippling depression.

       It's July 10...now i's July 11. I have decided to give myself a moratorium in being a  urlLink lush .  urlLink Constantly drunk  makes me find no strange coincedence in the fact that certain things and people in my life have been put off. It's not to see how long I can abstain from drinking, more like trying to find out how many other ways I can  urlLink occupy myself . I know I can't be the first to take this into thought and I don't have it the worst by any means but why sink any farther.

       I started reading an interesting book by John Krakauer today (Under the Banner of Heaven). Seems those ingenuitive Mormons have been up to quite a lot of flip flopping in the last century or so. This  urlLink Mark Hofman  character almost had the entire religion kaput by selling old manuscripts falsifying the claims and of Mormon founder and "prophet"  urlLink Joseph Smith . Strangely enough the Mormon church bought over 75% of Hofman's manuscripts and locked them in a vault away from prying eyes. No one would have ever known that the Mormonites had been following a bunk faith until Hofman started pipe bombing people. Turns out he had forged the things and wanted to cover his tracks...So much for uprooting the fastest growing organized religion since  urlLink Islam .
