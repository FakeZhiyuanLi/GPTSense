       Cory in South Carolina    wants to know about buying Apple RAM from Apple.    Don't buy RAM from Apple!     Apple has a reputation for ripping people off with RAM and other storage options with their Apple Store.  I recommend two good places for buying RAM for Apple computers.   urlLink Mac Mall  .  Mac Mall offers great Apple products at an affordable price.  Check out their G5's! (Great price).   urlLink Crucial  .  Crucial has been known for many years for having reliable options for RAM and other storage.

      Always keep older versions of browsers that allow pop-up blocking (such as Mozilla).  There have been laws proposed in the past that would make pop up blocking illegal...  If you have Mozilla Firefox 0.8, make a copy of it and keep it safe!

      Anonymous asks, "I have an HP Pavillion and I've reformatted my Hard Drive twice, and I still see the 'HP Pavillion' logo when I boot up.  Why is this?"   The HP logo is actually not on your hard drive.  It is actually preconfigured in your BIOS on your motherboard.  Most computer companies do this.  Unless you get a new motherboard, you will always see the HP logo at start up.

      Well, after two days of feeling ill, I am back to school.  It was better than I expected it to be, actually...  I am trying to update my blog more than I did in the old one, but as you know, I have an extremely boring life, and have little to talk about ;-)  Anyway, I am working on a project that will remain quiet until I am finished (sometime during the middle of this summer -- probably late June or July).  For a little hint,  urlLink here  is a link for the place it will be located.  "Philosophy" -- that's right.... you saw it.... "Philosophy"......  Stay tuned!

I watched " urlLink Secondhand Lions " today -- it is a HILARIOUS movie starring Michael Cain (my favorite actor), and Robert Duvall....  Watch it TODAY.  You won't be sorry...  If you have a DVD playing medium, get the DVD -- it's much better.  It came out in 2003 (September), amazingly - I haven't seen it until now!

       My love for TechTV oficially ended today at about 3:45...  Leo Laporte has officially announced his resignation of lead-host of  The Screen Savers , a "geek-powered" show made originally by geeks for geeks.  After hearing about ComCast's acquisition of TechTV from Vulcan Enterprises, Inc. I realized that the network would never be the same, but I never thought it would force the network's best host out of his position.  Leo says that he will remain host of  Call For Help until further notice, but will take on a "diminished" role in TSS.  Within 90 days the ComCast acquisition will be official and ComCast will have complete control over the company.  Comcast has also announced that they will be merging the entire TechTV network with  G4 , a Comcast channel dedicated solely to gaming and the gamer's lifestyle.  Somehow, none of this surprises me...  After TPTB cut back on TSS' on-air time from 90 minutes (1hr 30 min) to 60 minutes (1 hr), there was outrage in the TechTV community.  After that decision was made, the viewing audience dropped out by at least 40%.  I have remained a TechTV fan up until this point.  In fact, I was a fan at the very beginning (when the network was called ZDTV).  I have been a fan from the  very first episode of TSS when Leo was hosting the show with Kate Botello (who has now left the company).  From this point onward, I cannot remain a true TechTV fan.  I will not remain a part of an organization or community that allows such things to happen.  TechTV has been a major part of my geek-life.  I have been a TechTV / ZDTV fan now for 6 years (from beginning until now).  TechTV performance and show quality has dropped off a lot in the past 2 to 3 years.  Leo left Call For Help and Chris Pirillo joined the company, The Screen Savers was reduced to a meager 60 minutes, TechLive became a major part of the network, Leo became more "commercial" in his activities with TechTV, Kate Botello left the network and Patrick Norton was made replacement for her; and the list gets longer and longer as I think about all of the horrible things that have happened to this once wonderful network over the past few years.  I will continue to post updates about the merger, but I will no longer be an active fan of the network if things like this are continually allowed to happen.  We must put a stop to this...

He will be returning to his regular position hosting   urlLink Call For Help   and will continue his  urlLink "diminished" role on TSS.   This is still  urlLink very bad .

       TechTV is now officially no more (for everyone now).  G4 CEO, Charles Hirschcorn fired the  entire  TechTV San Francisco staff last night.  By firing all employees in the San Francisco (headquarters) sector, he will be allowing only 100 positions to come back ONLY for people willing to relocate to the new G4 + TechTV headquarters in Los Angeles, CA.  Comcast has single-handly managed to ABSOLUTELY DESTROY AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF TECHNOLOGY ENTHUSIASTS....  TechTV has been my ONLY resource for satisfying my technology needs for the past 5 to 6 years.  Now it's all gone.

      Currently, I am working on what seems to be the beginnings of a talk radio show.   urlLink Nick  and I will be working on this internet radio show early this summer and hope to have it running for the rest of the summer.  So, if you're curious, here's how I'm doing the test version right now...  I'm running PeerCast as a radio client which allows me to open a channel on port 7144 (supposedly internet radio).  Then, I have SHOUTcast and Winamp running in the background as my DSP (which collects sound to transmit).  Overall, I find this pretty neat, but there are still a few bugs to be worked out.  If you want to listen in on some of the test work being done, go over to peercast.org and click on talk radio.... We should be up there somewhere if we haven't pulled down for configuration...   UPDATE:  Right now we are DOWN because of a few minor bugs, but we should be back for some more testing tomorrow night...  I am going to dedicate the Tech Help blog that I have to show notes - Stay tuned!

       I just want to say this... I  have  given Windows Media Player 9 Series a decent chance.  But, nevertheless,  I despise it with a passion .  Really... I don't like it at all.  Not only does it interfere with my configuration here, but it crashes  all   the   time .  Has anyone else experienced constant crashing with 9?  If so, drop me an  urlLink email , or just leave a comment.  Although I really love Winamp, I have recently gotten very tired of it (even though I do host my  urlLink radio  station with it).  As an alternative to both of these, I use Real Player Alternative (more properly known as "Classic Media Player").  I love it -- it's simple in design, but does it's job very well.  Not only does it act as a substitute for RealOne's wretched player, but it can also play MP3s, OGG files, and WMA (Windows Media) files.  It also has an excellent system of codecs for streaming radio.  If you are interested in getting Real Alternative (Classic Media Player), you can get it  urlLink here .  This is a direct-download link so you won't be confronted with the maker's site.  They also have an excellent Quick Tiime alternative  urlLink here .    I'm currently listening to " urlLink Word of God Speak " by MercyMe.

       I got an  urlLink Xanga  account, and, just as I thought, worth nothing.  Here's my review of Xanga service:  Xanga offers several different "web-community" features such as the ability to give reviews of other people's "Xanga Sites".  My only favorite feature is a service called "eprops" which are a form of rating system that allow you to give a token to a particular post showing how you value it (2 eprops - liked, to 0 - disliked).  Overall, Xanga really doesn't offer that much.  It offers a pitiful comments system, awful templates, and a horrible url system (the format is http://xanga.com/users/namegoeshere).  whereas blogger's is short and easily managed (the format is namegoeshere.blogspot.com).  When you use Xanga, you feel claustrophobic, and that's the only way I know of describing it.  People, go with Blogger -- you'll be much happier -- I promise.    Now, it's my turn to be mean (since Nick has had his  urlLink turn ).  My cousin,  urlLink Rachel , is an avid Xanga user and flaunts her disgraceful love for  urlLink it  and animosity toward  urlLink Blogger .  Xanga is for wimps.... sorry, Rachel.

      Friday (5/21 - which is also Call For Help's last day) is our last day for real review, and Monday (5/24) is the last day before our first two exams.  I took the Poetry Exam for English this morning, and the Vocab Exam will be tomorrow (which will contain 280 vocab words and definitions).  So far in review, I believe the hardest exam is going to be Spanish.  Sooooo many conjugations and vocab words.  We have over 20 conjugations to do in present & past tenses and almost 300 Spanish vocab words.  So to all that read this blog, check me off as I go ;-) ...  Tuesday (English & Econ),  Wednesday (Science & Algebra),  Thursday (Spanish & Bible).  In the meanwhile, I need to go finish studying for my vocab exam for English and finish my problems review sheet for Physical Science...  Talk more as May 28th approaches closer and closer!

      Why must there be  so many people  that support Internet Explorer with their websites and make their websites "anti-Mozilla"?  I love  urlLink Mozilla  (I shouldn't have to explain why if you've ever used it) and I refuse to go to  any other  browser.  I've been using Mozilla Firebird and Firefox since they both launched and I will continue supporting them both (in fact I am thinking about donating some money to Mozilla.org).  But I know soooo many blogs and websites that are not even close to being "Mozilla-friendly" ... and some that aren't friendly for ANY browser (but I won't include  urlLink names  here).  So, from this day forward, I must say, INTERNET EXPLORER IS EVIL!

       Just five more hours and school will be FINISHED until this fall!  I finally finished all of my finals (I really hope I did well on them).

      I'm thinking very strongly about centralizing my headquarters over here at this blog...  I'll have a "Town Square" type feel.  WallaceHQ would be here, and I would have a link going back over to freewebs/geocities and all my other blogs and they would each link back to this blog.  I would probably rename this blog to "A Geek's Life HQ" or something like that and give a little intro information about myself, etc. (Yes I would actually include my profile this time)...  Hmmm.... decisions....  Feedback.  Please.

       I do track people using cookies with my counter. Since I do this, there is a chance that  if you are using Internet Explorer, you won't be able to view my counter correctly because IE disables .GIF files that require cookies in the latest update. The problem will persist until Microsoft releases its next patch for IE 6  or moves to IE 7.   If you can't see the counter, I invite you to switch to  urlLink Mozilla  Firefox , or my current favorite, My IE2. I love  urlLink MyIE2  because it combines the simplest features of Microsoft's IE with open source features from the makers of My IE2. Keep in mind that  neither of these are perfect, and neither is Internet Explorer, nor is any piece of software for that matter.   If you have any problems viewing my counter, or any other problems with my site,  please contact me  urlLink here .   I am currently playing (on the piano ;-)   urlLink Wonderful Grace of Jesus   .

        Why  must people be so ANNOYING about computer problems???  Why can't people just use  common sense ???  Post problems that ordinary computer users encounter are just COMMON SENSE problems.  They DON'T REQUIRE THOUGHT.  Example -  Why can't I see video?   You don't have a video card!   Ok, well, maybe not that simple, but you get the idea.  Another problem that I have seen is when people have the information they need, but they have NO IDEA how to apply it.  Example -  I know what drivers are, I also know that they are usally required for hardware to make them work (allow my computer to see them).  Why won't my printer work!??!?!  I plugged everything in, but it won't print .  Again, not THAT simple, but you get the idea.  I'ts almost impossible to get people to understand.  It's like they can't even hear you.  Then, when they DO ask for your help, they won't LISTEN to your advice.  HELLO??? ARE YOU THERE? - yes like that.  I don't understand.  From now on, if I'm at someone's house working on their computer, if for just ONE SECOND they don't listen to my advice, I'm walking straight out the door.  Even if that means leaving them stranded with a screwed up computer...  I'm just sick of it.   urlLink This  describes my pain perrrrfectly.  From now on, my only clients (even if I don't make a profit from my work) will be people who are WILLING TO LISTEN.

       Really sorry about the radio... I really wanted to do a web rado station this summer and so did  urlLink Nick , but I really have too much to do and I will when the school year starts again too.  Truthfully, I really don't feel like doing a radio station.  I'm tired all the time, and I really don't like the way getting up at 8 am every day sounds ;-).  Maybe next year?  My Xanga rant is over... In case you didn't know I swiched to  urlLink Xanga  for 2 days.  I deleted all my posts from there and I'm back to Blogger now.  I know I was telling  urlLink Rachel  and  urlLink Jessi   that it was bad, but it's ok I guess -- I still think Blogger beats it ( urlLink so Nick says too ).

      Ok, so I haven't posted in a while - but I've been busy!  I now have my own domain with my own paid space.  My new (paid) provider is  urlLink IX Web Hosting Solutions .  I must say, I was really nervous at first and I even cancelled it on the second day!  But, with confidence, I am back.  The new domain is justinwallace.org and it's up now with a little bit more information (but not much).  I'm still working on a few designs.  I got frames to work though...  Seems that my frames dilemma was actually a Geocities problem after all.  Worked on my server fine.   On another note, my most recent obsession is  urlLink Monk .  USA is rolling out with a brand new season and I've been watching the premier all-day-long.  In fact, I'm watching it right now at it's....let's see... 12:30 AM.  Happy Saturday everybody, I'm going to finish watching this epsiode of Monk and I'm going to bed!  G'night!

      Someone once said, "Merging two unstable ideas is the most stable foundation possible".  I am going to be joining forums with  urlLink Nick Elder , The Universal Geek by this December to January.  The Univeral Geek + GeekNet = The New GeekNet  Doesn't really compute, but I will be registering the domain, etc, etc. so I wll decide the domain name and site name.  Nick has agreed on the name, so I see no problem...  The reason I have decided to do this is because I need someone else to help me with the big tech community I want to create...  I really won't have time to do it on my own when school starts back.  I really hope I will be able to get a domain by the end of this year, but if I can't, I will stay with TK and Freewebs for as long as possible  But, I must admit, I'm very tired of the current design I have with Freewebs/Geocities and I can't use Yabb or PHPbb with it so I can't have my blog powered by PHPbb or Yabb... or can I?  I'll play with it... If I can't get a domain and I get the forums up on tk, It'll be geeknet.tk.

      You should probably know that I have cancelled my IX Hosting account along with my domain.  Justinwallace.org no longer exists. But, my blog is still here and it will be my main source of communication.  I cancelled because I only had 1 MySQL account which was utterly stupid.  I also found another hosting company for $65 / year and I would get 3000 MB storage (3 GB), 40 GB Bandwidth, UNLIMITED MySQL accounts, UNLIMITED email accounts, UNLIMITED FTP users, Linux or BSD Server.  With IX I got 1500 MB storage (1.5 GB), 10 GB Bandwidth, ONE MySQL, 1000 Email, 1000 FTP, Linux Server.

       I have 1 Gmail account to give away to someone... Here are my requirements:  1. You must be an active Leoville Town Square member. 2. You must call yourself a geek and be proud of it 3. You must play the piano... by ear only....  Sorry for the strange requirements, but I don't have that many Gmail invites left (2 actually), and I just thought I would have fun with my last 2 so it might take a while to find people who meet the requirements. The last one will be especially interesting .  I do play piano actually... by ear, and for my church, and I've always wanted to talk to someone I don't know that plays by ear. Not only that, but as I mentioned above, I want to put specific requirements now that I only have 2 invites left.  So, to get it from me you have to send an email to astaro@alltel.net. In the email I need to see your name, your Leoville ID, and your email address - all in list form. I am just going to trust that you meet the last requirement -- I may ask you a series of questions to prove it, or I may not. So, why embarrass yourself? If you can play piano by ear, ask me for an invite. If you don't play, then just don't!

       It appears that w.blogger is no longer working properly with Blogger posting.  I haven't seen any problems posted on the w.blogger website, but they may be in the process of updating their site and hopefully the program itself.  I just moved away from  urlLink Sygate  (as I posted about in my previous post) and moved back to  urlLink Zone Alarm Pro .  I refuse to go to the free edition because of flaws in the latest release of it.   urlLink SpySweeper released its latest upgrade a few days ago.  Be sure to download it.   There are a lot of new and revised features, as well as the latest definitions.  PeerGuardian seems to be working fine now.  I was getting the "DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL" error in XP just about 30 minutes ago, but I fixed it by updating my drivers for my ethernet card to the latest XP release.  I downloaded  urlLink SpywareBlaster  again and got the latest release.  It was giving me problems in the old version, so I thought I would give this a try.   urlLink Leo  showed off Spyware Blaster in one of his tips on G4TechTV Screen Savers.  In case you're wondering, I will never call "The Screen Savers" by its original name ever again while it is associated with G4.  From now on when referring to TSS I will call it G4TSS, G4TechTV Screen Savers, or G4TTV TSS.  Right now I am in the process of reading   urlLink The Da Vinci Code  , but I am putting that off for now while I finish watching  urlLink G.I. Jane .

       Allied Forces begin the invasion of axis-powered Europe this day in 1943. Story from  urlLink TheHistoryChannel.com :   On July 10, 1943, the Allies begin their invasion of Axis-controlled Europe with landings on the island of Sicily, off mainland Italy. Encountering little resistance from the demoralized Sicilian troops, the British 8th Army under Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery came ashore on the southeast of the island, while the U.S. 7th Army under General George S. Patton landed on Sicily's south coast. Within three days, 150,000 Allied troops were ashore.  Italian leader Benito Mussolini envisioned building Fascist Italy into a new Roman Empire, but a string of military defeats in World War II effectively made his regime a puppet of its stronger Axis partner, Germany. By the spring of 1943, opposition groups in Italy were uniting to overthrow Mussolini and make peace with the Allies, but a strong German military presence in Italy threatened to resist any such action.  Meanwhile, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler knew that an Allied invasion of Nazi-controlled Europe was imminent, but because Germany's vast conquests stretched from Greece to France, Hitler was unable to concentrate his forces in any one place. In an elaborate plot to divert German forces away from Italy, a British submarine off Spain released the corpse of an Englishman wearing the uniform of a British major and carrying what appeared to be official Allied letters describing plans for an invasion of Greece. The body washed ashore, and the letters were sent by the Spanish to the German high command, who reinforced their units in Greece. The Axis had only 10 Italian divisions and two German panzer units on Sicily when Allied forces attacked in the early-morning hours of July 10.  First to land were American and British paratroopers and glider-borne troops, and at dawn thousands of amphibious troops came ashore. Coastal defenses manned by disaffected Sicilian troops collapsed after limited resistance, and the Anglo-Americans moved quickly to capture Sicily's southern cities. Within three days, the Allies had cleared the southeastern part of the island. In a pincer movement aimed at Messina in the northwest, the British 8th Army began moving up the southeast coast of the island, with the U.S. 7th Army moving east across the north coast. The Allies hoped to trap the Axis forces in the northwestern corner of Sicily before they could retreat to the Italian mainland. In the so-called "Race to Messina," Montgomery's advance up the southeast coast was slowed by German reinforcements, but Patton and the U.S. 7th Army moved quickly along the north coast, capturing Palermo, the Sicilian capital, on July 22.  In Rome, the Allied invasion of Sicily, a region of the kingdom of Italy since 1860, led to the collapse of Mussolini's government. Early in the morning of July 25, he was forced to resign by the Fascist Grand Council and was arrested later that day. On July 26, Marshal Pietro Badoglio assumed control of the Italian government. The new government promptly entered into secret negotiations with the Allies, despite the presence of numerous German troops in Italy.  Back in Sicily, Montgomery and Patton advanced steadily toward Messina, prompting the Germans to begin a withdrawal of Axis forces to the mainland. Some 100,000 German and Italian troops were evacuated before Patton won the race to Messina on August 17. Montgomery arrived a few hours later. The Allies suffered 23,000 casualties in their conquest of Sicily. German forces sustained 30,000 casualties, and the Italians 135,000. In addition, some 100,000 Axis troops were captured.  On September 3, Montgomery's 8th Army began an invasion of the Italian mainland at Calabria, and the Italian government agreed to surrender to the Allies. By the terms of the agreement, the Italians would be treated with leniency if they aided the Allies in expelling the Germans from Italy. Later that month, Mussolini was rescued from a prison in the Abruzzo Mountains by German commandos and was installed as leader of a Nazi puppet state in northern Italy.  In October, the Badoglio government declared war on Germany, but the Allied advance up Italy proved a slow and costly affair. Rome fell in June 1944, at which point a stalemate ensued as British and American forces threw most of their resources into the Normandy invasion. In April 1945, a new major offensive began, and on April 28 Mussolini was captured by Italian partisans and summarily executed. German forces in Italy surrendered on May 1, and six days later all of Germany surrendered.    I've been trying  urlLink Sygate Personal Firewall  since yesterday around 4 PM as a place-holder for finding a decent free firewall.   urlLink Zone Alarm  seems to be terrible in the last upgrade to 5.x.  I upgraded my Windows XP  and Windows 98  machine to Mozilla Firefox to  urlLink version 0.9.2 , released yesterday (July 9th).  Yes, scratch the Windows 98 part -- Mozilla still seems very unstable on anything less than 2000.   urlLink PeerGuardian  has been causing my XP machine to crash... a lot... I'm still working on a solution to the problem.  I don't want to switch back to  urlLink ProtoWall , however, because it just wasn't working correctly after I took my computer out of sleep mode.  I may try it later, though.  I went to Barnes & Noble Spartanburg location yesterday and finally bought   urlLink The Da Vinci Code  , a superb book written by novelist Dan Brown.  Have I ever mentioned how much time I spend on Leoville's Town Square?  Too much... far too much... Yesterday I spent approximately 3 hours and today I have been logged in and viewing posts on and off since 11:30 this morning... that's 8 hours seeing that it's exactly 7:30:00 PM now.  It appears as if I will have to stop using W.Bloggar because it just isn't working to post anymore...  Will work on the problem...

       I got up at 11 this morning and all I did today was play Red Alert.  It's really pitiful -- I really hate gaming with a passion (especially after G4 took over TechTV.

I tried out Skype last night (from the makers of KaZaA K++).  It's really kind of interesting and neat to use, but I didn't like it because you have to have Skype credit to even begin to use the stupid piece of software!  Also, keep in mind that it is  not  open-source...

      The original Screen Savers from TechTV in San Francisco is now officially over with.  Tonight will be the last live episode at the old TechTV building and on the 16th everybody will begin the move to LA.  Kevin, Sarah, Dan, and a few others will be making the move.  Leo is gone and will be working on Call For Help 2.0 in Canada througout August and September.  He will be going to Toronto, Canada one week per month to tape 4 episodes per day that week.  Patrick has officially left, but not because of G4's stupidity, but because he wanted to leave the company finally (not to mention the fact that his bride-to-be doesn't want to live in LA).  So, it looks like Kevin, Sarah, and Dan are the only original "on-air-talent" that will be moving.  This means only one thing... the rest of the roles will be filled by G4 staff.  Ick... "Games! Games! Games!".  What's going to happen when somebody calls and asks a question?  "Well, I don't know the answer to that, but have you played this new game yet??? It's grrreaattt!"  I think this is going to make me sick.  Everybody says good-bye to the old set and everybody they cared about tonight at 7.  Then they start packing.  The new LA-G4-TSS will be premiering on the new network sometime in September (from what I understand).  Nobody really knows what the new set will look like, but I can imagine that it will be as big of a change as from the old basement to the "pent-house loft" that they found as their home in this current set.  I want everything to just go away and return to normal.  Why must stupid G4 change everything?  It just doesn't make sense to me.  Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?!   Why can't they just understand how we as ZDTV~TechTV long-time fans feel?  We care about the changes!  We don't like them.  At all...  It's not just a network to us.  It's a community.  It's more of a lifeform!  It's alive -- it lives within each of us.  We all love and care about TechTV and we never want to see it go away.  But, as most things do, it has to come to an end.  G4 has to ruin it.  Oh well.

        EDIT :    By the way, this may come across as arogant to some people... Your opinions have been noted, and they have just now been thrown away just as quickly... I really don't care -- I'm tired of everything I put up with...     You might have rididculously impossible family members if...    1.  They always criticize you AFTER you so graciously fix their computers.    2.  They always criticize you WHEN you are so graciously fixing their computers.    3.  They always criticize you BEFORE you even begin to so graciously fix their computers!    4.  They always show their ignorance by pointing out that you "think" you know a lot more than        they do (when you really do!)    5.  They always love to make stupid little remarks that seem derogatory until you come up with        something a heck of a lot funnier...    6.   urlLink They use Xanga over Blogger when they know that their ignorance never triumphs!     7.  They say things behind your back that only reveals more stupidity and ignorance.    8. They make it look as if they know more about a particular subject to make themselves look more intelligent, when they know thoroughly that you will always win any battle in that        subject.    9.  They argue about things that they really have no bearings on themselves!    10.They make you seem worse than they are when around other family members.    11.They ask your opinion on things and really want to know what they should do (uh... the RIGHT way to do something) and then they turn around and do the opposite...    It's generally a rule of nature for family members to NEVER listen to you and understand what you are saying mainly because they CAN'T understand what you are saying because they are too busy talking about you behind your back...

          UPDATE  :   Rut ro... Not a good sign. The Clie seems to be charging, but the charging light just went off and no display! As soon as I touched it, the light came back on...     Ick... I have no warranty on this thing... Ick... Ick... Ick...  Here's what I get when I turn it on:  Blinking "Palm Powered" logo.  That's all!

       Leo has decided to move from TypePad to Wiki for his show notes on KFI.  Servers are loaded down right now and it is VERY slow.  Waiting right now for other people to get off... it's soooo slow.  Can't wait for Leo to move to a dedicated server all his own.

          ANNOUNCEMENT  :    I decided to post this up top because I want everyone to see it.  I have once again revised my comments policy.  Instead of blocking everyone who is not a blogger member, I have decided to once again allow anonymous posting.  I have two conditions however...      (1) You MUST obey the following rules:

      Nick is now co-admin of this blog.  I was just testing it out to see how it would work. I'll remove his admin privileges for now, but I'll put him back up on August 15th (before I leave for Myrtle Beach).

      Wow... lots of modifications and changes around here.  Here's a list of all the changes I've added:   1)  Added Links.   2)  Added MoBlog updaters for Leoville, Morgan's Webb, Sarah, and Kevin.   3)  Added Events.   4)  Looking for a good free javascript calendar (events could be more organized).   ---  In other events, I will be out of town on vaction through the week of August 16th (August 16th - 21st).  I will not be back until late Saturday, August 21st.    To family members: If you need to get in touch with me while I am gone, I will email you my cell phone number.  Email me at astaro@alltel.net.  Nick, I want you to keep an eye out on my blog while I'm gone.  I'm going to make a separate password so you can log into my account.  Please call me tomorrow and I'll tell you what it's going to be.  Feel free to make modifications to the template if you like.  I will save a backup of my template so don't worry about messing anything up.  My news (in my own words) will be postponed.  Also Nick... I need to talk to you about doing the news if you would... I would be much appreciative.
