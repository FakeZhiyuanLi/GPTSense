      Well, there is more interesting news on the political front today.  urlLink This article  talks about one of the best and most respected prognosticators saying the race is Kerry's to lose. Now I am not a huge John Kerry fan. I supported Howard Dean in the primary and was really turned off by the negative campaign tactics that Kerry and Gephardt used against Dean, not to mention how the DNC stabbed the Dean man in the back. However, you can be damn sure that I will not vote for Bush. That leaves me in a quandry because I live in Iowa, a swing state for one of these candidates. Nader has lost all credibility, respectability, and electability so my choices are limited. I have been toying with the idea of writing in Howard Dean...a protest of sorts. At any rate the election feels like a vote between two evils, and I hate that more than anything. To me there are not a whole lot of differences between Kerry and Bush except that Bush has had four years in the drivers seat to make a royal wreck of things.  I also look at this  urlLink website about the electoral vote  every morning because it is updated with new state by state polls which makes it more accurate than reports of national popular vote. Tomorrow it gets updates from all the new Zogby info, so be sure to check it out then as well.

      Okay, I admit that I am kind of a geek when it comes to the Olympics. I did not pay any attention to any of these sports before last weekend, but now that they are on TV I cannot help but become enthralled with the drama. One of my favorites that I am waiting for is the indoor cycling. It is simply amazing to watch that many bikes on an inclined track racing at amazing speeds. I think I am addicted to the Olympics though, I sat this morning and watched the entire live broadcast of the women's marathon....two hours and eighteen minutes...with commerical breaks. To top it all off, NBC's melodramatic heartstring stories had me so emotional by the end that I shed a tear when the woman from Great Britain had to quit, and when the American took the bronze...damn emotions!  I also know I am too enthralled when I start to pick apart the terminology and rules for some of the events. The one that has me perplexed tonight has to do with gymnastics, which is one of the sports I only see when the Olympics role around. I love the gymnasts because they are able to do things with their bodies I could never possibly do, but can certainly fantacize about! Tonight the floor exercises were going on and I noticed the commentary..."A wonderful dismount!", "A difficult mount to start". Now, my question is, how does one technically "mount" the floor exercise? When you step on the floor, are you not mounting this apparatus? The conundrum has me searching the complex resources of my college trained critical thinking mind. Can one additionally mount something that one is already mounted on? The real kicker is then, how does one "dismount" the floor exercise. My creative mind wanders to gymnasts doing a double-back sommersalt off of the floor and exploding like a rocket off of the floor, out of the arena, and into the sky above. Or perhaps if the gymanst stuck the landing, and was sucked into the earth...that would be a dismount!  If anyone can help my feeble mind grasp mounting a floor, let me know. Otherwise, I will be here attempting "stick the landing" each time I get up from the couch....

      Nothing brings me greater joy than  urlLink Homestar Runner  (be sure to watch the intro). This website makes me smile and is a great example of why creativity should be cultivated, supported, and developed in all of our children. It is a website chronicling the characters of a land of make believe...or maybe real life.  urlLink Homestar  is the supposed star. One of my favorite parts of the site are the weekly emails answered by the resident grump/mischief maker/tenderhearted  urlLink Strong Bad . His  urlLink emails  are so funny you can't help but laugh......I am spending my day catching up on his emails! Check out one of my favorite clips,  urlLink Strong Bad interviewing Homestar . An added bonus, you can never go wrong in a land of make believe when one of the characters is called the  urlLink The Poopsmith . Never hurts to spend a whole morning smiling!

      Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. A group of veterans that puportedly served with John Kerry in Vietnam and are now producing ads challenging the credibility of two of his purple hearts and his bronze star. Bush II has said he believes that Kerry served honorably, but will not dissavow the claims of the group.....but, why would he? It serves to help him politically if people second guess Kerry's credibility on the veteran front. And today, it is proven that the Swift Boat Veterans, a 527 group "not affiliated" with a campaign or candidate,  urlLink has lied, and is connected to Bush II .  Now, I really deplore how negative this campaign has gotten on both sides, but this makes me sick. A group of veterans, many of whom won the same medals as Kerry, in the same incident, using negative campaigning to destroy a worthy veteran who served proudly. The kicker is that Bush II is connected. He has no shame, even though he too is a "veteran" of military service, although there are many questions regarding his service and discharge that may or may not have had to do with his cocaine use. How can any "leader" not condemn this faulty attack? Well, I will tell you why. It is because Bush II and the Royal Jester Karl Rove have used these tactics before and blamed them on operatives acting independently,  urlLink it happened to John McCain in the South Carolina primary in 2000 . So much for visionary leadership. Is it now acceptable to question Bush's character in all of these matters? Even if he does not personally give the order, isn't he responsible for having advisors like these on his staff and responsible for this character assassination? Character does count, and doing anything and everything to win when you are  urlLink behind in your re-election campaign  is a sign of weak values.

      I fancy myself as a future scuba whiz. I have only been three times, all at a resort in Jamaica while on my honeymoon, but it grabbed hold quickly and I am currently saving enough money to take lessons and get PADI certified. Hopefully that will allow me to dive on those rare occasions that I get to a place near the ocean!  This cracked me up though... urlLink more protective services  from the Department of Homeland Security, brought to you by the (un)Patriot(ic) Act.

      Everyone has heard of the film...Farenheit 9/11. No matter what you think of Michael Moore or what side your politics fall on you cannot help but react to this film. Personally I have seen it twice, and I feel that it is truly an emotional roller coaster of a ride. I don't buy all of the conspiracy theories presented in the movie, but it is easy for me to believe some of the things. Michael Moore will show you  urlLink support for all of his accusations  if you want to see them. I did not support the invasion of Iraq in any sense, so seeing many of the realities of that conflict was upsetting, hurtful, and left me feeling very angry, although I did not need any of the movie to make me angry at the reign of Bush II.  The thing that really gets me about this film are the unfounded attacks on this film by critics that refuse to see it. How can you attack and discredit something that you have not seen? How quickly do people dismiss your opinions if you have not even seen what you are attacking? The right(wrong) wing seems to have a pure hatred of Michael Moore (much like my own for Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reiley and others), going so far as to label him as a traitor and his opinions as treason. Saddam Hussein would agree. For a state to condemn dissenting opinions in such a manner is a direct slap in the face to what the right(wrong) wing says we are fighting for. Michael Moore airs an opinion that, while not mainstream, gives voice to an important segment of the population. The truth is that the majority of America does not lie along the extreme left or right, but the population needs to know we exist because these sides point out important issues to consider for everyone else.  I wish people would see this movie so we could debate it on it's merits, rather than who is making the movie. One quality of the servant leader is that they listen to an opinion or statement based on the merit of the statement, not on who is saying it. That is called respect and every American brave enough to voice an unpopular opinion should be given the respect.

      So I guess I have been noticing something since the tragic date of September, 11th. Something that is eating at my soul and my spirit and something that seems to be eroding the core of the good ole' USA. It is the loss of optimism.  You see I know what the terrorists took from our country and from all of us living in it. They stole the sense of wonder, the pride, and the happiness that our country used to be know for. Now I know that some of you may say that pride and patriotism was never higher than after the period of September 11th....but think about it this way. The last time you were in a fight, and you got cold-cocked in the jaw....maybe you got a good lick in, or maybe you kick the living crap out of the opponent. Sure you feel good about your victory, but somewhere deep inside you feel bad. You feel shamed that you got hit. Maybe you don't show any ill effects...but maybe you are more cautious walking around. September 11th was the biggest cold-cock ever laid on the steel chin of the USA. We banded together to blow the hell out of the Taliban in Afghanistan which made us feel better, but deep down we were changed.  Bush II and his inquisitions had us all peeping over our shoulders. Looking for that next big attack. We all bought it. We gave up our hopes of what we could do as Americans to huddle together to make sure we did not lose the safety of being Americans. Some would say we might have had it coming...but I think it is a shame that the optimism is gone and that we look at the future with pessimism and distrust.  Maybe not eloquent, but reason enough for me to start this blog. I am the iowa wine guy and I am the optimist in the face of certain failure. I am starting this blog after reading countless others that are full of doom and gloom. I hope to be able to share the pinpoints of light that shoot in to our lives, and hopefully to also share my opinion.  Who am I? A Residence Hall Director on a Iowan University. Surrounded by 484 of the best and brightest students in the country. Daily living has it's interests. I am a Socialist Democrat, observing a selfish society, and I am a follower of the true teachers of the past....a servant leader. The characters of my life are all valuable to me and I hope to share them with you.........To Be Continued
