         School starts tomorrow. What fun. I am not looking forward to it at all. There has been so much confusion in trying to get my classes lined up that I dread stepping foot into that hot brick building.    At the end of last year (sophomore year), I applied for a spot in the Advanced Placement Government class and  got my acceptance letter. All was well until I received my tentative list of classes and didn't see AP Gov anywhere. Turns out the teacher got confused and put me into the senior Advanced American History class instead. She refuses to put me in her class. Instead, I'm being forced to take the senior class my junior year and the junior class my senior year. What crap! I actually wanted to take Government. This is an awesome year to. I'm already so active in the Democratic campaign that it would be no trouble to get 30 hours of community service.    Is it insane (and tres vain) to spend $23.50 on blush? The women at the Estee Lauder counter were just so nice and full of compliments... I couldn't resist. The "desert rose" just looked wonderful with my fair complexion, or so they said. Somehow I managed to avoid buying the "pink shimmer" lip gloss and the "winter sage" eyeliner. I am gullible.    Wish me luck tomorrow. Hopefully I can dazzle my classmates with my surprisingly long locks, revamped fashion sense, and "desert rose" blush.    In reply to a comment on my "lack of inspiration" post:       Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, I've already done that. In February, I had an interview published between myself and the local band "Fatkid Dodgeball". It went over very well.

       I have no inspiration.  I need to write something for the paper  (Note: I write for the Springfield News Sun, for free, in the teen section.)  There has to be some topic that I can cover. I've done interracial dating, plagiarism, weight,  STARS  (more on that later), and countless other topics. I'm stumped! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   Random facts about moi:  -I've been wearing glasses since I was 7.  -I'm part of STARS, which is an abstinence-based mentoring organization. We work with kids ages 12 to 14, spending time with them and educating them on the benefits of abstinence from sex, drugs, and alcohol.  -I am, in fact, committed to abstinence. It's not because of religion or anything. It's just what I believe.  -I'm currently between religions.  -I've never been kissed, or asked out, or even gone to homecoming with a date.  -I'm a democrat.  -I met John Glenn last week.  -I wear a size 9 1/2 shoe.  -I'm a video game junkie.   Ta-da. Now for the food...  Brunch    Ramen noodles with snow peas and a peanut garlic sauce.

      Snack    Had aforementioned bowl of cherries with fat free Cool Whip. Brilliant!  Dinner    Spaghetti squash with low fat spaghetti sauce and basil. It's wonderful.   Did excersize. Seriously need to find a way to zap cellulite. There's an unsightly amount on the back of my thighs, and if I'm not careful it will migrate to the front.  I just had a thought. Somebody needs to talk to the people at Macys and Bloomingdales and the like. If they only made their size 12's the size of their 14's, I think they would sell many, many more pants. Women will go to a store where they can fit into pants a size below what they normally wear. It's common sense!

       Hurrah for that.  It always feels good to start something new. New blog, new book, new diet. Yes, diet. Let me break it down for you...  -I'm 16.  -I'm 5'4.5"  -I have dark brown hair, green eyes, and I'm as pale as can be.  -I'm a 41-31-41.  -I weigh 195 lbs (on a good day).  I used to weigh 222, then I joined Weight Watchers. All was well and good, and two years later I weighed 170. It was wonderful! I was wearing a size 10, my waist was 28 inches, and I felt amazing. Unfortunatly, I couldn't keep the weight off. I gained back half of what I had lost the first time, and now I can barely fit into a size 12. It's miserable. I'm getting ready to start school again (my junior year), and I look just like I did when I left in June. F-A-T.  Well, I'm done with that. No more trying to squeeze into my old "thin" jeans. No more worrying about wether or not my calves are jiggling when I'm walking. No more hiding my arm fat under long sleeves in the summer. I'm going to watch what I eat and excersize. More importantly, I'm going to submit my activities to you fine people for approval. It's group support. Here we go...  Breakfast: Whole grapefruit with two packets of NutraSweet Mug of Strawberry Citrus tea  Lunch: Bok Choy with dressing (1 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar), and 1/2 block of Ramen Noodles  That's it for now. Later I think I'll do some weight training.
