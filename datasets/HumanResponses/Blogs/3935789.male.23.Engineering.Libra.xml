      My first blog on the web!  I had been meaning to create my blog space for some time now, but had been too busy.  I was working from morning 'til late night for the past few days on my first research paper.  It was finally submitted two days ago to IEEE's EPEP conference which will be held at  Portland, Oregon ( urlLink EPEP 2004 Conference ).  Hopefully, it will be accepted for publication.  Finally, I'm gonna have some time off and can go back to Toronto and build my new rig, which I had been meaning to build for some time now, but never had the chance nor the time yet.  Once I get back to Toronto, I will also be setting up my own personal webserver machine and hopefully will be able to bring up my new website with it.  So whazzup with the new site, you ask?  I'm mainly gonna put my more "serious" stuff on it.  Like my resume, my on-going OpenGL development, introduction to some of my research interests and studies, and some of my hobbies and interests.  For the less serious stuff, that's what this blog page is for!  Last night, I've taken some pictures of Montreal downtown from my apartment's balcony.  We have fireworks on every Wednesday and Saturday nights during the summer.  So I decided to take out my DC and shoot a few pics and some short videos on the event last night.  I didn't get up close last night though, only stayed on my balcony as I was really tired from all the revising and editing of my research paper, I deicded to just stay home and do nothing.  Once I get my website up, I'll post some of those pics on it, together with my pics from my Hong Kong visit last year at November and December.  Hong Kong is an amazing place to go shopping.  At almost every subway (or MTR, as they like to call it there), there's either a huge (HUGE!) shopping mall where you can spend an entire day at (and still won't get bored), or you can go onto the streets and just walk.  And the prices are cheap too, atleast compared to the prices you would have to pay when you shop in Canada or the States.  Night scenes were also amazing, especially near Christmas night.  Unfortunately, I had to go back home before that in order to prep my gear to come up to Montreal to begin my graduate studies here.  Still, some of the shots I was able to take was amazing.  I also went on to Chu Hoi (Is that how you spell it?) and Shenzhen during my visit.  Those places in China are still not as developed as Hong Kong, but if you want to buy cheap, those are the places to go.  But you'll have to be very careful of the stuff you buy.  There are reasons why some of those stuff are so unbelievably cheap.....  I was also drooling over all the new DC models in HK when I was roaming around the malls.  My current one is an older model.  A Canon A40 SureShot.  Its not a bad DC, really.  But its pretty bulky for the features it has.  Well, when I save up enough money for a new one, then may be...(may be I should concentrate on getting a job first ;-D)...
