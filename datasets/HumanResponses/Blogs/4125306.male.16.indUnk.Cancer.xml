      Am I wearing pants? Whose to say what pants are? Whose to say what wearing pants can be defined as? Is it simply have the material next to one's skin? Or is wearing pants have a deeper, more complex, meaning? Are any of you wearing pants? Do I want the hot women to wear pants? Are all the hot women wanting to slap me and all the ugly ones very offended? Whose to say what ugly and hot is? Maybe a hot girl is ugly to me, but who would be able to tell? But is she wearing pants? I don't know. That was todays lecture on pants. I hope you learned a lot because there is a test on nuclear relitivity in 10 minutes.

      My philosphy for why monkeys and cheese along with cows cannot live together is because like the human jesse, monkeys love cheese; however cows, such as rene, also like cheese. So the cows, being bigger than the monkeys, beat up the monkeys, eat their cheese, and steal their milk money. How do you think the cheese feels, huh, well let us ask our expert Dustin... DUSTIN- Well clearly the monkey is in the wrong because the cow gives the milk to make the cheese so the cow, who doesn't like the monkey, should be allowed to choose who get the cheese. ME- Okay that was weird but anyways thats my opinon on why monkeys, cheese, and cows cannot live together.

      Cake is recent years has lost popularity, why is this? I believe that the modern height of cake was the early 20'th century when all the western world was united in praise of cake. Then they lost popularity. Some say it was eh war, some say the war was caused by the loss of cake poularity, but i say that the two are one and the same. When cake sales dropped the french pastry market suffered and the germans no longer had the cake there society required to remain powerful. Inflation rised and the country was in shambles, leading to WW1. If cake had remained as popular france would have had slightly more power and germany would have been more stable and the world would have been ushed into a golden age of world peace and enlightenment, but wiht the loss of cake sales this can never be. Don't agree with me? I'd like to see you come up wiht a better explanation!

      Hey everyone. Why should we have world problems? I think we should just ignore the problems, say fuck the news, and eat cake. Everyone likes cake, right? And everyone who isn't insane hates war. So I say we replace war with cake. People would be happy, fed, and wouldn't complain. But then, we'd run out of cake and the wars would start over cake. Who cares. That would be funny. George Bush yelling at Vladimir Putin because they stole each others' cake. Ha ha ha ha!

      Eeryone has a worst day of their life. Even people who have been sitting around happy as a puppy eating chocolate and dancing with hot models naked all their life have had a worst day of their life. When you have a worst day of your life look at it this way, if it's the worst, somebody will get a worse one eventually and also that makes it a special day, so you should be happy. The worst day of your life only comes once. But when there is a medium of bad day and the non-could-be-worse day, they are never bad because you can remember how bad it was before and how that day is not bad at all compared to the worst day ever. So you should be happy because it is not the worst day of them all. So, you have no reason to be sad as a bad day always has a reason to be happy!

      Now the real question should be am I here?  Am I human, am I boring you to death?  The last one is probably the only true one.  What you say.  I say that too.  See?  WHAT!?  Yeah...  I'm good at this.  Anyways.  Back to uhm... something.  Ah yes.  Am I here?  Well.  Yeah.  I mean look, I'm here.  You can detect me with your senses.  You can't sit where I'm sitting.  You'll be sitting on me.  So I do exist.  Popular to what most people think.  And those damned philosphy majors in their preppy-ass fucked lives.  OOOooo Look at me!?  I can say questions all day and fuck with your brain and somehwo have the impression of being smart.  Fucking philosophy majors....  Anyways.  Yes... Next question.  Am I human?  That depends on what I mean?  But yes I am human.  I do make mistakes and I'm not a dog.  I think...  OH SHIT!!!!

      You guys wanna know some coffee that's the bomb!?  Of coursey...   Coke Coffee:  Get some  black coffee  with nothing in it.  Then grab some  Coca Cola or some cheap Coke rip-off product.   Then pour half your cup, mug, boot, whatever you're drinking out of of the  black coffee.   Then, oh the so delicate process.  Add the rest of the container you're drinking out of of the  Coke .  Make sure theres room cause the next ingrediant is sugar!  K, por in how ever much sugar you want and the coffee'll fizz!!  Now it's like those expensive shit coffees you find in the ever-loving snot Starbucks.  Stir it and drink the junk.  Super caffine and super tastiness.  Down like 4 cups and try to sit still bizotch!  Hahaha...   That's about the end of my post that wasn't philosphy but you guys should know it anyways.  If you want a little kick add about a shot of vodka.  Smirnoff perferable.  Thanks for tuning in!  Till next time, keep up the shit dumass!
