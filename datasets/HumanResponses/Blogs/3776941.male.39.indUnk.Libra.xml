      I was saying all day - well, I said it a couple of times - don't know who is going to win the footie tonight, too close to call. But, about an hour before kick-off, I thought: "Mmm, maybe put a little punt on for interest sakes." This even though I watch football in all its forms whether I have a bet on or not. So... ...pound on Ronaldo to score first goal and Portugal to win 2-1 - fifty quid coming to Maison de Reidski. Ah, the wonders of  urlLink online gambling ! It was actually one of the most enjoyable games of the tournament, too.

      Following on from yesterday's post, the strike by members of the RMT on the Tube really kicked in today, with services being decimated. This meant long walk to work this morning and tonight - but hardly the disaster that was made out in the - sadly - much-read Evening Standard. It is the sister paper of the Daily Mail, so what do you expect, but the way in which this crap paper reported it made it out to be nothing less than another blitz. This boy travelled from south east of the city to north west this morning - and what did this mean for Reidski? A 65 minute journey rather than one that takes 45 minutes! Hardly a problem. And it was pretty much the same coming home. We now await further developments. Last word, for now, on the strike, though. This country's anti-trade union laws make secondary or sympathy action out of the question by those not involved. But when leading lights in other Tube unions - drivers' union ASLEF and the one people join because they know they will never be called upon to take action, TSSA - actively encourage strike breaking and tell members to take the opportunity to get some overtime in, people should know about it. 'er indoors, the boy and Reidski have been having theme dinners during the course of Euro 2004. Mousakka, Latvian potato salad, Croatian steak, Spanish chicken stew and good old fish n chips have all featured so far. Tonight, we will be mostly having Portuguese chicken piri piri - it promises to be hot and it promises to be tasty. I'm off to cook it. Before I go, though, excitement of the wrong kind entered Reidski's world last night. Kerfuffle was heard out front. Reidski thought: "Someone's gettting a kicking out there." Reidski runs out. Reidski finds bloke with blood streaming down face. Bloke's english isn't that great - and he was rather dazed and confused - and he hands phone to Reidski. Reidski tells police where to rush to and where to bring ambulance. Reidski thinks he sees muggers down road. Reidski wants to chase them. Reidski thinks better of it. Reidski waits with poor victim. Cops arrive. Ambulance arrives. Reidski gives statement. Reidski get back in his hoose. Reidski finds that the boy has handily placed his cricket bat in hall for defensive purposes (what a sweety the boy is). Reidski goes back to finishing George P Pelecanos's The Sweet Forever. Reidski thinks Pelecanos is one of the greatest crime fiction writers of all time. Reidski also thinks he gets really right wing when crime comes close to home. Reidski hopes that muggers get mugged and get a right kicking. Reidski knows that violence isn't the answer. But Reidski is a complex character and wants the muggers' head stamped on and balls kicked. Reidski is now off to cook dinner. Wow, that was one long post.

      The London media is awash with misinformation, downright lies and a massive propaganda exercise, as well their efforts, yet again, to portray our society as one of individuals and not of classes. And why? London Undground workers have told their gaffers that enough is enough and are currently taking part in a 24-hour strike. Management, for weeks and weeks, new that this strike was threatened, so what did they do? Did they follow the example of Network Rail and put their top executives at work looking for ways to resolve the dispute? Did they get round the negotiating table with the Tube workers' union the  urlLink RMT ? A big fat NO to both questions. What they did was to ignore all requests for talks and, when they did see that this strike was not an empty threat, they sent in middle management into talks with the union's national officials. London mayor Ken Livingstone then got involved, inviting members of staff to become scabs - a great leftie is our Ken. But then, with the strike only hours away, top management suddenly thought that they should make the effort and get into talks with RMT officials. Far too late to call of the strike, however. And what does our blessed media do - make it out to be a few "militants" in the leadership who have caused the disruption. While we should never be surprised at such activities by the propaganda arm of the State, we still are. A democratic vote of the members? Pah, mere pawns in the leftie machine. Let's ignore the wishes of the membership and concentrate on the personalities. The media are wankers. To quote Rab C Nesbitt: "I should know - ah wis wan!" Good luck to those Underground staff who want to see a decent wage for spending their working life hudnreds of feet under the ground suffering horrific pollution in doing so, for wanting decent rest periods between shifts and in the middle of their shifts, for fighting for a 35-hour week (like that enjoyed by the journos who slag them off) and for taking action to achieve their aims. I love it when the organised working class show yet again why there is power in a union.

      I have no idea why I'm doing this, other than the fact that my mate  urlLink tnr  has been doing it for some time and it looks like fun. 'er indoors can see the downside already though, by just declaring: "I'll never get on the computer now!" Anyway, this is just a short introduction. The title of the blog is so because my favourite author of the moment (my faves in music, books, films and other thingys changes by the day, by the way) is George P Pelecanos and The Big Blowdown is one of his great novels. I hope to introduce such topics as my lapsed communism (I may explain the lapsed part some time soon - although I still say "Viva the class struggle) my total respect for and gratitude to one of England's greatest living treasures (Morrissey) and all things music, along with my devotion to the beautiful game (curling - eh, only kidding, its fitba). Speak to you all (i.e. nobody) soon.

      I absolutely love living in London. London is so alive in a way that no other city on this planet is. Had one of those great London nights out last night. Met up with people from work first of all to celebrate Brizie's birthday, we then moved into town for a meeting cum social gathering of a group calling themselves the "Sohemians" - and a very interesting bunch they were too. They concern themselves with anything that has a link to Soho (hence their name) and include the likes of high Tories, liberals and a smattering of lefties. At closing time, four of us went off to an Algerian restaurant for some wonderful lamb and cous cous, followed by whiskies and beers in a couple of late opening bars. Got home at around 4am, but, with no work to attend, felt fine after a lie in. Just about to head off to catch train to Irvine with the boy. Packing his gear earlier I noticed that he wasn't going to take his new Celtic top, this as a result of me telling him about a couple of Tic fans who have been violently attacked and killed by neanderthal huns in recent years for simply wearing the hoops. After a quick word from Reidski that we always wear our colours with pride and that he should never be intimidated by fascists and thugs, said top was duly packed. Looking forward to catching up with family and old friends over the next few days.

      The boy's party today. It was fun. There was a bar. The bar was shut.  The started with many boys convering on chez Reidski at around 10 am. Two car loads then drove over to Lee Valley ice centre, with those who I was driving annoying passers by with shouts of "I've got your number" "I know what you did last summer" and, bizarrely, "Do you want to join BT". The boys had fun.  The ice skating people weren't quite ready for us when we arrived, so game of footie on the grass outside ensued.  All the kids enjoyed the ice skating which followed and another game of footie which followed after that.  Reidski's head expanded at the end when older teenage kid who came along said to me: "Did you used to play with a semi-professional club?"  After they departed (well, most of them as two are having a sleep-over tonight) it struck me and 'er indoors that we are unlikely to see them all together again as they all disperse into different secondary schools after the holidays. To say that this is sad is a huge understatement.  They are an&nbsp;magnificent bunch. They are always polite, some are hugely funny and entertaining and they are incredibly loyal to one another. On the ice rink there always seemed be one of them around if another fell over. On the football field, it was all big and meaningful&nbsp;apologies if a tackle went in a bit too hard. Not one bust-up the entire day, quite an achievement for a bunch of 10-11 year old boys away from home.  With the boy busy upstairs, an opportunity arose for me and 'er indoors to finish off the second series of Six Feet Under. She's still bubbling away 45 minutes after its ended. It's certainly powerful stuff. Now want to start on series three as a matter of urgency.  Night out in Soho didn't work out last night. Brizie, whose 40th birthday we were supposed to be celebrating, has switched off his phone and refusing to respond to messages. Methinks that middle-age crisis has hit the lad pretty hard. Did have a nice meal with the family, though. Mexican style steak was lovely, washed down by one of my favourite beers, Dos Equis. The pina colada's were nice, too. As was the flirting with the absolutely gorgeous waitress. The waiter was quite a stunner, too, now that I think of it!  It's time to open another bottle of Reserve Saint Marc, so that's all from me.

      The boy's birthday and it's been a little laid back so far.&nbsp; Presents included Gamecube, a midi hi-fi system, Franz Ferdinand and Blink 182 cds and, the highlight, proper Celtic top. After listening to his new tunes I played him some of my new sounds. I went for a late night trip&nbsp;into town last night, mainly to get a haircut, but couldn't avoid visit to Virgin megastore. I hate that bearded twat Branson, but his shops are good. Hair's now cut in number three style and new cds are on the decks and a real mixture of old and new they are too. Representing the new are Alphabetical, Modest Mouse and Killers. The not-so-new are Belle and Sebastian. And the old are Joni Mitchell's Ladies of the Cany0n, Beastie Boys Ill Communication (which contains one of greatest songs ever in Sabotage) and the New York Dolls. I also purchased the Damnded's vastly underrated Machine Gun Etiquette as birthday pressie for Brizie who I'm seeing later tonight for celebratory drinks in and around Soho. First up though is party meal out with the boy and his mum at local restaurant. Tomorrow is the boy's party, which involves taking him and around a dozen of his friends to ice skating in Hackney for the day. It promises to be fun - hope there's a bar. Just before I go, 'er indoors has just come in with the shopping, part of which is Sainsbury's Chocolate Caramel Shortcakes.&nbsp; Try them. They are delicious! And finally. Why all the fuss about Mandelson getting a job as EU commissioner? I think he'll fit in rather nicely with the rest of the scum that represent the fascist superstate project.

      What a great day that was/is. The boy has been on superb form for the past two days now - things are looking up. He's currently in his room with his mate who goes back home to Iceland at the weekend, so the boy won't see him until the holidays are over. At least they are going to the same big school after hols. Work today was great, with important stuff to get on with coming my way. I'll tidy all that away tomorrow in readiness for my week's leave. I'm popping back home to Irvine next week, so hopefully a pint with  urlLink tnr  and  urlLink radical postman  will be in the offing, although the latter is on the by-election trail for the SSP at the moment. The boy will get the chance to catch up with his Jock cousins, which always thrills him. I came across a great piece in this week's  urlLink Spectator , with the wonderful title of "The Tories are in such a poor way that they have to start telling the truth." The title alone makes one read it, but it is a great analysis of the opposition. One has to go through a registration process to log into the Spectator website, but, at no cost, it is well worth the brief hassle as it&nbsp;contains some of the best political writers around. Most are on the right, but they are entertaining, nevertheless.  There's also an unintentionally funny piece from Leo McKinstry in which he argues, quite rightly, that with the Treasury spending plans that have been announced this week, Blair is buying his way back into the affections of the traditional Labour vote. This, McKinstry says, means that Britain is being pushed against its will further and further to the left!! Yes, dear readers, to the left! While we can shake off McKinstry's more absurd claims of Blair taking us on the parliamentary road to socialism, the writer does have a point about the PM trying to buy the next election. The nonsense that Blunkett came out with this week, Brown's spending plans, Darling on transport (generally welcome, but not quite thought through) and Reid on the NHS, all short-term measures to try and get the third term. What's missing from Blair's own calculations, however, is that the majority of the British public think he is a lying bastard. That doesn't stop his friends in the media slavering over his every word, however. Take the absurd comment from the BBC's political commentator Andrew Marr on the evening after the debate on the Butler inquiry when he said, without any hint of irony, that, although the majority of the public no longer trust Blair, in terms of the commons debate "he came through that unscathed." The political elite certainly live in a cocooned world. That little square mile around Parliament Square is a world apart from the lives the rest of us live - and very scary that can be at times. Back to the mundane, Stiff Little Fingers are on the turntable and I'm off to uncork a bottle of wine.

      Today was a shitter, only punctuated by an excellent lunch break with Brizie, Anonymous, Guitarman and the Anarchist. As well as not feeling well at all, those at the staff meeting (which I didn't attend due to fear of impending vomiting, which, luckily, didn't materialise) took a decision that I was really pissed off about. The boss, in an effort to promote a healthy work environment and healthy lifestyle, put in place a policy where those who don't smoke get extra day's leave. But there are those who decided that this is divisive.&nbsp; So it's not divisive to spend half your day going out the office for a fag&nbsp;and rely on the non-smokers to cover for the selfish fag-smoking "workers" then? Now, I'm not saying that all smokers are selfish workshy lazy sods - oh, alright then, I am!! The company also subsidise gym membership, so next thing we'll hear those very same smokers and their idiot allies saying that, because they can't be bothered to exercise, this subsidy should be shared by all employees in their pay packets. Well, they can fuck right off! The other thing that I was pissed off about today was the fact that I missed one of the&nbsp;great &nbsp;sporting spectacles - that of the  urlLink Tour de France&nbsp;  making its way up one of the highest peaks of the 21 stages, L'Alpe d'Huez.  I love Le Tour and believe that it is one of THE sporting achievements and makes for great viewing on the box. Eurosports' commentators are always a treat. Although I've kept an eye on the reports of this year's Tour, I've not really watched it much, next to nothing of it actually. Lance Armstrong is heading for an unbelievable sixth triumph in the event. I read his autobiography a couple of years ago - a great read, an inspirational invidual, with the only down side being his recent friendship with US President Bush. I suppose we can't all be perfect, though. The boy has just gone out to play, with a watch on, so hopefully there'll be no late returns like we've had over recent days.

      Prizes galore - okay, pint for when I see you - to whoever guesses (no, there will be no searching on google) whose song is the title of this post. And...has anyone noticed the musical references to some of the other posts' titles on Reidski's blog?  Come on,  urlLink tnr , I know you know.  Anyway, the title tonight refers to my deep domestic depression, which is only ebbed by visits to work, to play badminton and to the gym.  Things between Reidski and the boy are not going well, although they did perk up a bit when I took him to see the mighty Celtic put on an entertaining show at Fulham on Sunday - but 90 minutes of fun in an otherwise shitty few days is not good enough.  Two bright spots on the cultural front at the moment.  One, still making my way through the entire works of George P Pelecanos at the moment, having, in the last week, finished both&nbsp;Shame The Devil and Shoedog. While the latter is certainly not anywhere near his best, the former is a classic. The thing about Pelecanos is not just the great noir crime writer that he is, but also the street smart and progressive outlook in his books - to say nothing of the excellent musical references. I'll revisit this post soon and link it to his website...this man is definitely on the side of the angels.  The second cultural wonder of the past week is the fact that 'er indoors and Reidski are currently working our way through the second series of Six Feet Under on DVD. Totally missed the first series, passing us by as the classic TV that it is.  But, after buying a friend the first series on video (remember them?) we thought: "Must watch the rest."  This has meant a long wait for second series to come out on DVD, with, meanwhile, third series having been broadcoast, which we had taped from TV.  With fourth series about to hit our screens any day now (is this all sounding rather confusing?), it has meant rapid watching of DVD - 10 episodes in the last week alone - with third series to follow in rapid fashion.  Everything about this programme is excellent - acting, directing, writing and the rest.  If anyone posts a comment that includes what happens next, in the words of the Pixies: "You fuckin die!"  Come on, cheer me up you motherf******!

      A watershed moment arrived for those inhabiting chez Reidski today - the boy's days at primary schoold ended. An extremely emotional event it was too, by all accounts. The Reidski himself could not get the afternoon off work, but 'er indoors was there and witnessed the kids crying their eyes out, leading to parents crying their eyes out and general sadness all around. But a group of nine of them decided they would have an end-of-school party. The venue? Yes, you guessed it, chez Reidski! It was nice to come in from work to be greeted by some really great kids. All polite, all saying thank you when given anything, all saying goodbye and thanks at exit time. A lovely bunch, indeed! Getting back to not being able to take time off from work, I could have really done with a few extra hours kip. It was work's day out yesterday and much drink was drunk. In fact, far too much drink was drunk. Had a great time, of course, as I always do when out bevvying, but this was a particularly superb day. Joined another couple of Scots immigrants in singing flower of Scotland at the Karaoke, followed a little later by Bohemian Rhapsody. Performance at the singing was only just beaten by performance on the pool table. Took on all-comers and beat them all. Me and co-worker won around the first dozen or so games, before the halos slipped. But on they came again and we done the same again. Reidski, for those who don't know, has never known when to stop when it comes to slugging bevvy, so, on arrival back in London, carried on drinking. Chinese meal and beer, followed by whisky, followed by more beer on arrival back home. Did have a hangover, but certainly had a lot worse. Certainly going to take it easy on the alcohol front over the weekend, however. Well, that's the plan anyway. Got tickets to see Celtic on Sunday, they travel south to take on Fulham at the Cottage, my favourite football ground in england and certainly the prettiest in the world - can't wait.

      The Morning Star today published yet another article by London's political boss, Ken Livingstone. Following the article that appeared on 3rd July, outlining the mayor's position regarding the current dispute with Tube worker, Pink Ken gets another chance to air his anti-union views. Now don't get me wrong, I am all for debate and discussion and airing our differences. But this is no internal labour movement roundtable talks we are having. To put it in its simplest terms - an industrial dispute is class struggle. Livingstone is on the side of the ruling economic class in this particular struggle and the Tube workers are on the other. The Morning Star is  supposed  to be the paper of the labour movement. More than that, Livingstone has urged Tube staff to cross RMT picket lines. It is one thing - and the Star is correct with it - to quote the bosses in a news piece. But to give over the pages to them is quite another. This one defies explanation. Particularly as the Star has so far failed to comment on the dispute in its editorials. So we await developments... On the domestic front, the boy's last week in school is upon us. Today, it was prize giving. A very uninspiring event, I thought, with very little said about the wonderful achievements of the students, both academically and in their social skills - I know much about the latter cos half the class seem to spend most of their time in the boy's bedroom at the weekend. They definitely are a good bunch. The boy picked up a few prizes and I'm glad I went along. Nearly didn't as a result of him saying last week that the event wasn't for adults. He then asks us last night if either of us are going and we replied: "But we asked you last week if it was for parents and you said no." His response? "I thought you meant were the  prizes  for the parents" - he can be strange at times, our little boy! So, I goes off to other side of London to start work at 8am. Waited for first person to take over from me at 8.45. Tube ride all the back home. Attend school prize giving. Tube ride all the way back to work. Bloody knackering it was, too. Must dash to pick the boy up from his footie training.

      That term - "the age of cretinism" - comes from a film I watched recently, The Barbarian Invasion. It's a great film which I would recommend. French-Canadian and, therefore, sub-titled, it's a reflection on a dying man's life. There's a scene where he and his friends are looking back at what they have been involved in, saying something along the lines of: "We have been communists, socialists, marxists, leninists, stalinists, trotskyists, revolutionaries....but we now live in the age of cretinism." That quote has had a powerful effect on me and my political thinking. I thought about it again tonight when, accidentally, I switched on to Sport Relief. I hate those televised charity appeals, the way in which they horrifically manipulate people's emotions to achieve the victorious aim of beating "last year's total." It's also sad the way that working class people, with the greatest intentions it must be said, donate money on such occasions in the belief that they are making a difference and making the world a better place. This is not to say, by the way, that nothing good comes out of such occasions - I would be loathe to say that someone's local community centre shouldn't benefit from a Sport Relief grant or that some poor and dying kid in Somalia or the Sudan shouldn't be given something to eat for a week or two. And I don't mean what I have just wrote to be a flippant remark. But, rather, these are matters of the State and not the individual do-gooder - and this is where the "age of cretinism" comes in. Working class people today face an assault on their lives, thoughts and beliefs in way that no previous generation have ever had to face. Private Eye, which I read and enjoy, can joke and satire our dumbed-down society, but it is certainly no joke. I also think of cretinism when I see and hear the voices on the left who try and qualify the trial of Saddam Hussein by saying that Bush and Blair should be on trial too or, even more outrageously, that he shouldn't be on trial at all cos the Iraqi government that is trying him is a puppet regime. When was Saddam a friend of any progressive in his own country or in any other. I may be wrong, but I thought he was only ever a friend of international capitalism. I say, I couldn't give a fuck who is trying this despotic madman cos he is a despotic madman, full stop. Yes, Bush and Blair may need to face their own trials, but that is a completely different argument. The cretinism also surrounds the latest hoo-ha about whether Brown is about to replace Blair - it seems that, once again, politics is all about individuals. I have no answers as to how we get rid of the age of cretinism, but I am sure that there are answers out there. I don't think that my generation are going to provide them, but I have high hopes that our children are going to turn this society upside down - and I hope I am still alive to see it! Footnote: listened to some great sounds today - Pet Sounds, Woody Guthrie's Dustbowl Ballads and, at the moment, Costello's Spike. All absolute classics and maybe if more listened to such sounds that cretinism would be banished. You never know!!

      What a great day: the sun is shining on the capital, 'er indoors has gone off to Dungeness with mates for the weekend, the boy is at friends hoose, Pet Sounds is blasting out the speakers - yes, a great day, indeed. I may have mentioned in earlier post that one of my favourite authors is the great US crime fiction writer George P Pelecanos. I'm currently on the fourth of his DC quartet series, Shame The Devil. Here's a taster:   "The Capitol loomed dead ahead, crowning the street. On this particular winter day, the press and public were fixated on the alleged extramarital affairs of the sitting president and giving odds on his possible impeachment. It was the media event of the decade, the subject of sarcastic lunch conversations all across town. But few talked about the real crime of this city, not anymore: American children were undernourished, criminally undereducated, and living in a viper's nest of drugs, violence and despair within a mile of the Capitol dome. It should have been a national disgrace. But hunger and poverty had never been tabloid sexy. Beyond the occasional obligatory lip service, the truth was that no one in a position of power cared."   Pelecanos - he's good. He's very good. He oozes cool and his writing is packed with great musical references. Visit his  urlLink website  and find out more info on this great writer.

      I know - far too much comment on the boy, but, come one, let me indulge a bit cos he's leaving his little school shortly. Soooo... ...he and schoolmates performed excellently in the musical. The good thing was that there was no main characters so most kids in the class got a line or two. It was a good gang v bad gang scenario, with the boy in good gang cast. Good gang won in the end cos they had (in the play) got martial arts training (hence the Kung-Fu Fighting scene) and beat off the bad guys, who accepted they had got done over. Not sure of the message - i.e. fight violence with violence - but there we go. Anyway, the boy did have a great part and was there in the duet at the end with the girl singer (classically trained). Tears definitely formed when that was going on - they made a great couple! And what about the others? Ewan's romantic oppo also done a great version of "Somewhere", while we also heard "Tonight,Tonight" and "Maria - I just kissed a girl named Maria" - both absolutely astounding. Back to the boy - ever so proud of im and, even though he does my head in at times, I love him sooooo much. Today, well....finished work at 11am and then had a mega session at the gym followed by a mega session at pub. Then it was Morning Star chat when I met up with former colleagues at that newspaper and had great afternoon in pub with them. What followed was nothing to write home about, other than the fact that I fell asleep in cinema watching The Cooler - nothing to do with the film, just that I was pissed and not wanted at home!! 'er indoors is off the morra, so, hopefully, the boy and I can have a nice dad and his lad type weekend. I am actually so pissed that I must stop typing now.

      Came across this great article in this week's edition of  urlLink The Spectator  magazine. Please, if you anyone out there feels the need to comment on this, please digest the contents of the article first and don't jump to any knee-jerk liberal Guardian-style response.  " Let Slobbo speak for himself     John Laughland says that the case against Milosevic has all but collapsed for lack of evidence     For a few hours on Monday, the world’s human rights establishment was seized by terror. Slobodan Milosevic had been due to begin his defence at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, but instead discussion focused on the former president’s fragile health, which has been made worse by the rigours of the trial. When the presiding judge, Patrick Robinson, said that a ‘radical review’ of the proceedings would now be necessary, many do-gooders feared that their worst nightmare was about to be realised — that the international community’s main trophy in its crusade for morality might, if only on medical grounds, be allowed to walk free.      Few human rights activists had ever contemplated such an outcome, still less an acquittal. The presumption of innocence has never counted for much in the highly politicised world of international humanitarian law. One war crimes expert, James Gow, said on Channel 4 on Monday that it would be better if Milosevic died in the dock, because if the trial ran its course he might be sentenced for only relatively minor charges. That ought to be awfully embarrassing for those like Gow who have assured us that he is as guilty as hell. Fortunately for them, the ICTY is not really in the business of acquittal. As one academic specialist on the ICTY, Professor Michael Scharf, has noted approvingly, the ICTY’s rules were designed ‘to minimise the possibility of a charge being dismissed for lack of evidence’, a sentiment of which the Queen of Hearts would have been proud.      As it stands, the judges seem poised to impose a defence counsel on Milosevic. Far from helping him, of course, the intention here is to weaken his defence by requiring him to be represented by a lawyer who knows the issues far less well than he does. Such a move would fly in the face of the judges’ earlier rulings against this idea — and the new presiding judge himself was, in the past, especially firm that this would be contrary to the defendant’s rights. It would at least provide comfort to the beleaguered prosecution. When he is not trying to get the court to force Milosevic to give up smoking — a certain death sentence for any Serb — Geoffrey Nice QC, the lead prosecutor, has repeatedly sought to accomplish this switch, not least because the two-year prosecution case has been a nearly unmitigated disaster.      Since the trial started in February 2002, the prosecution has wheeled out more than 100 witnesses, and it has produced 600,000 pages of evidence. Not a single person has testified that Milosevic ordered war crimes. Whole swaths of the indictment on Kosovo have been left unsubstantiated, even though Milosevic’s command responsibility here is clearest. And when the prosecution did try to substantiate its charges, the result was often farce. Highlights include the Serbian ‘insider’ who claimed to have worked in the presidential administration but who did not know what floor Milosevic’s office was on; ‘Arkan’s secretary’, who turned out to have worked only as a temp for a few months in the same building as the notorious paramilitary; the testimony of the former federal prime minister, Ante Markovic, dramatically rumbled by Milosevic, who produced Markovic’s own diary for the days when he claimed to have had meetings with him; the Kosovo Albanian peasant who said he had never heard of the KLA even though there is a monument to that terrorist organisation in his own village; and the former head of the Yugoslav secret services, Radomir Markovic, who not only claimed that he had been tortured by the new democratic government in Belgrade to testify against his former boss, but who also agreed, under cross-examination by Milosevic, that no orders had been given to expel the Kosovo Albanians and that, on the contrary, Milosevic had instructed the police and army to protect civilians. And these, note, were the prosecution witnesses.      Serious doubt has also been cast on some of the most famous atrocity stories. Remember the refrigerator truck whose discovery in the Danube in 1999, full of bodies, was gleefully reported as Milosevic was transferred to The Hague in June 2001? The truck had allegedly been retrieved from the river and then driven to the outskirts of Belgrade, where its contents were interred in a mass grave. But cross-examination showed that there is no proof that the bodies exhumed were the ones in the truck, nor that any of them came from Kosovo. Instead, it is quite possible that the Batajnica mass grave dated from the second world war, while the refrigerator truck may have contained Kurds being smuggled to Western Europe, the victims of a grisly traffic accident. The realisation is now dawning that lies were peddled to justify the Kosovo war just as earnestly as they were to justify the attack on Iraq.      The weakness of the prosecution case was underlined by the fact that its triumphant conclusion in February was to broadcast a TV documentary made several years ago. This suggests that its two-year marathon has not served to advance knowledge of the truth beyond the tall stories peddled by telly hacks at the time. Even professional supporters of the ICTY now admit that the only ‘proof’ of Milosevic’s guilt has been General Sir Rupert Smith’s stated ‘impression’ that Milosevic controlled the Bosnian Serbs, and Paddy Ashdown’s statement that he ‘warned’ the former Yugoslav head of state that war crimes were being committed in Kosovo. In February, the chief prosecutor herself, Carla del Ponte, admitted that she did not have enough evidence to convict Milosevic on the most serious charges.      The supposedly impartial judges have been deeply complicit in this prosecution bungling. The ICTY has long been characterised by an unhealthy community of interests between the judges and the prosecutors; I have myself heard the first president of the ICTY, Judge Antonio Cassese, boast that he encouraged the prosecutor to issue indictments against the Bosnian Serb leaders, a statement which should disqualify him from serving as a judge ever again. In the Milosevic trial, the judges have admitted a tawdry parade of ‘expert witnesses’ who are not, in fact, witnesses to anything. In Britain, the role of experts is rightly under the spotlight after the convictions of some 250 parents found guilty of killing their babies have been thrown into doubt precisely because they relied on this kind of testimony; but in the ICTY you can be a ‘witness’ without ever having set foot in Yugoslavia.      Numerous other judicial abuses have been legitimised by the ICTY. The use of hearsay evidence is now so out of control that people are often allowed to testify that they heard someone say something about someone else. It is common for the ICTY to offer reduced sentences (five years in one case) to men convicted of hideous crimes, mass murder for instance, if they agree to testify against Milosevic. The use of anonymous witnesses is now very widespread, as is the frequency of the ‘closed sessions’: a glance at the ICTY transcripts shows pages and pages blanked out because sensitive issues have been discussed in court — sensitive, that is, to the security interests of the Great Powers which control it, the USA in first place. The ICTY’s nadir came last December, when the former supreme commander of Nato, Wesley Clark, testified in the Milosevic trial; the court agreed to let the Pentagon censor its proceedings, and the transcripts were not released until Washington had given the green light. So much for the ICTY’s transparency and independence.      Ironically, Slobbo has one objective ally: the British prime minister. The possibility is now real that a conviction of Milosevic can be secured only on the widest possible interpretation of the doctrine of command responsibility: for instance, that he knew about atrocities committed by the Bosnian Serbs and did nothing to stop them. But if Milosevic can be convicted for complicity in crimes committed by people in a foreign country, over whom he had no formal control, how much greater is the complicity of the British government in crimes committed by the US in Iraq, a country with which the UK is in an official coalition? This is not just a cheap political jibe but a serious judicial conundrum: the UK is a signatory to the new International Criminal Court, and so Tony Blair is subject to the jurisdiction of the new Hague-based body whose jurisprudence will be modelled on that of the ICTY. So if Slobbo goes down for ten years in Scheveningen jail because of abuses committed by his policemen, then by rights his cell-mate should, in time, be Tony.

      Wednesday night is the night of the week I enjoy most, even though it makes me most tired. No, radicalpostman urlLink  , not that. I play five a sides every Wed after work, a most thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining and healthy exercise. The problem we had tonight, however, was the problem we have had on a few other occasions since we started a few months ago - namely, not enough people turn up so five a sides turn into four against three. Well, when you're on the side with just three, it is non-stop running, whether defensive running or attacking. I maintain every week that the point of the exercise is just that - exercise - but it's great when you bang in the goals like I was doing tonight. I think final score was 19-18 to other side - close, no cigars, but plenty of calories burned to smithereens. A lot of calories put back on in the pub afterwards, but not too many, as tiredness means get back home after not too many pints. Anyway, got home and in walked 'er indoors, the boy and mater of 'er indoors from the boy's first night in school performance. Before anyone accuses me of ignoring boy in school play, by the way, Reidski is attending tomorrow night's performance. The boy was buzzing and high as a kite, while 'er indoors and 'er mater raved about whole performance of all the kids. Can't wait till tomorrow's show! The boy's school is ace. Stuck in the middle of an estate - no, that is not a negative - and with all cultures and many students whose first language is not English, the teachers perform miracles. They treat the national curriculim with the disdain it deserves, but, obviously have to meet the criteria that the State demands.  And, while league tables are one of the most disgusting things about our education system - treating schools like football teams - the boy's schools defies the odds and gets the results which only the faith (i.e. state funded, but privately aided) schools can match - a stirring example to others! We told the boy recently that we would give him a fiver for each level five (i.e. the top mark) he achieved in his exam results this year. Oh dear, the boy got level five for all disciplines. So £25, plus £10 bonus for perfect marks, going to the boy. Weird thing happened to me on the way home from work yesterday. After session in the gym, Reidski decided to spurn use of Tube and walk through central London on the way to overland train station. Down near British Museum, approaching pub which I had no intention of going into, I saw someone outside who looked the spitting image of my sister's hubby. It was him, down from Lincoln for training course and he had just got off the phone to my sister to ask for my telephone number. So had a very pleasant few pints with him and then went off home, finding the whole episode very strange indeed. A city of around 9 million and you just happen to bump into a relative - weird, man.

      Now, when this blog started, I never thought that I would use it as a vanity publishing exercise. But, I came home from work - and the pub - and found that the boy had written a poem. I think it's good and I want to share it with others. Remember, the boy is 10 and this is exactly the way that he wrote it:   THE SALITEN   The fierce Saliten with four strings like tails and four horns on its head Stood in the bushes with a lion which was dead Yes, this fierece creature killed lions and ate them for lunch And maybe a gorilla; now that was brunch.  Now this creature lived in the great Bingaboo jungle. Where the trees were yellow and you'd often come across the tree of bungle. The leaves were blue And the dirt stuck like glue.  He lived in the trees and hung from his tails With his horns sticking out like protruding nails. He killed every animal and was the only one of his kind. And had but one enemy: the Jalekanian wart hog, this beast he could not find.  And he would eventually kill him too. And would eat him with his chicken stew. But the Jakelanian was prepared. And both fighters were never scared.  For when this fight had begun. A hunter came along, the next day their heads were hung. In a museum of heads. Yes both fighters were in their death beds.   (The boy: 2004)

      I'VE WON AGAIN - HURRAH HURRAH! Not much, mind you, but twenty quid is handy all the same. Saw the odds (Greece at 4-1) and thought: "That cannot be ignored." So I didn't ignore and put a fiver on them.  The game itself was superb and Greece thoroughly deserved to win this championship. Has a team, in the history of either World Cups or European Championships, ever had a harder route to the trophy. First they beat the host nation. Then they draw with Spain. A blip agains Russia follows. Victory against title-holders France, followed by a win over a Czech team who, up until that point, looked as if they would have beaten any side in the world. And then it was back to Portugal. The game got interrupted a few times by negative comments from our house guest. The mater of 'er indoors arrived today, staying until Thursday. She's down to see the boy perform in his school musical, a kind of West Side Story meets Fame on the streets of south-east London for the 21st Century, which takes place on Wednesday and Thursday. The boy plays the romantic lead, no less. Earlier today, we thought that the boy would maybe need to have heavy make-up to play the part as a result of being punched in the face by one of a gang of older boys who wanted to steal his ball and mess with him and his friends. A chase ensued, but the boy and friends survived intact. No sign of swelling or bruising yet, so it looks like the boy will be allright on the dramatical night. It's very strange all this sort of stuff. Eighteen months ago, the boy was never allowed out on his own, but as time has gone on, you have to give some leeway. That has meant more and more times when you don't see your kids for hours on end. That has its good side - being able to get on with things or just getting on with listening to loud music and drinking alcohol and relaxing, with no children around. But it has its down side, too, like not knowing where the fuck they are and who the fuck are causing trouble with them. But, as I say, you've got to let go at some stage, I suppose. The other freaky thing about the boy is that he has only two weeks left of primary school and then it's summer and then it's the big big big school. I'm wandering aimlessly through my head at the moment, so I think I should just say goodnight and see ya later.

      Funny old day, really. Go up late (just before 11). Done a bit of tidying up while 'er indoors took the boy to his kung fu class (keep in mind: don't mess with the boy, you folks out there). Then thought "it's now or never" for the re-putting up of the towel rail in the bathroom, which, although only took around 10 minutes, I hated doing because I hate doing anything that is remotely conncected with DIY, except for painting. I didn't do the planned painting duties - window panes on the outside and other external parts - as a result of the promised showers. The showers never arrived. Went to the newsagent to get the Morning Star and, shock fucking horror - a page is given over to Ken Livingstone to explain why he encouraged Tube workers to scab during the strike on the London Underground during the week. It is one thing to allow some dodgy types in the labour movement to air their views in the so-called "paper of the left", but Ken put himself outside the movement altogether last week when he made his pro-scab comments. The Star has been going downhill for some time now, highlighted when they done everything to promote the crackpot Respect during the recent elections - which, I may add, was against the wishes of the Communist Party of Britain (whose programme is supposed to be the editorial policy of the Star). But to allow the bosses (for that is what Livingstone is in this matter) to write freely, attacking workers, in its pages is a step too far. It's not the first time that Livingstone has attacked a group of strikers, of course. Back in 1998 journalists at a national daily newspaper took strike action (six long fucking weeks on the cobbles) in defence of their editor who was sacked on the most spurious - and politically motivated - grounds, with an organisation by the name of Socialist Action behind these attempts to destabilise the paper concerned. Those strikers won their dispute. During the strike, an MP close to Socialist Action tabled a motion attacking the strikers - not one other MP signed the motion, however, and, such was the outrage among his fellow Socialist Campaign Group members, the MP was forced to withdraw the motion. The management were subequently kicked out of the newspaper and the editor was reinstated. The MP in question was Ken Livingstone and the newspaper was the Morning Star.  Now, that same editor allows Livingstone to attack another group of workers in his paper. Weird how history comes around like that, innit?

      First the good news: Went to a great gig in town last night. Some may remember the N'yah Fearties, a group of raucous rebellious Ayrshire types around in the mid to late '80s, some say them in the same mould as (very) early Pogues. They did, I think, tour with Shane and the lads at some point.  Anyway, some of them are back as the  urlLink Junkman's Choir  and they played at the St Moritz, a great little club in Wardour Street (as in "There's an A-bomb in"). The place was heavin' - which had its down side as getting to the bar proved very very difficult indeed (in fact, Reidski only drank two pints in the two and half hours or so he was there, believe it or not). On the up side, however, the band were outstanding and a lot more is yet to be heard about them, no doubt. Got home at three this morning - NOT DRUNK!! Not even merry, for fuck sake! But a great night out, nevertheless. I may even go and see them again tonight as they are playing in my local in New Cross - and it's guaranteed that, if I do go out, I will get blootered out of my skull - but I'm not sure. Now for the bad news: I have just seen on the news that Marlon Brando has died. He was, without doubt, one of the greatest actors of all time and starred in a few crackers. Streetcard Named Desire and On the Waterfront being only a couple of milestones in an impressive career.  Just a note on On the Waterfront, by the way. There are those, and I've heard them, say that this is cinematic union-bashing. I beg to differ, rather seeing it as a bit of corruption-bashing.  But, on Brando himself, he was a strong supporter of, among other fine causes, the civil rights movement and for the rights of the Indigenous American peoples. I'll raise a glass to the great man tonight, but first I'm off to the gym to pump some iron and to run on the treadmill for half an hour or so, followed by a nice 15 minutes or so in the steam room. Sounds good, eh? Come and join me some time. You're all invited.

      Reidski and family are off to the Vendee region of France tomorrow. It will be fun, but, if only Reidski had more than two bob to his name, it would even be better.Thank goodness that wages will be in bank on thursday, so there is light at the end of this horrendous penniless tunnel. A great day was had by myself and the boss yesterday. The boss had a spare ticket for my beloved Millwall, playing the much fancied to win quick return to the Premiership Leicester. Went along thinking "if we get a point, it will be a bonus." However, the Lions played superbly, with their two new signings from Canada playing a blinder. They totally played the midlanders off the park and won 2-0. It really cheered me up, particularly as I had made a fuck-up at work this week and was rather miserable anyway. Millwall winning, Celtic winning and the multinational corporation that calls itself Man Utd losing - well, what a weekend. Be back in a couple of weeks - missing you already!

      Rejoice! Rejoice. Thanks to a recent article in  urlLink The Independent  and in this month's  urlLink Uncut , we hear the stupendous news of a new album from The Blue Nile, release date being August 30th. I haven't been this excited about a new album coming out for many years. By the way, while the story was in the magazine format of Uncut, I couldn't easily find it on their web site, so try The Indie for info on this one. On the domestic front, the boy has been attending a summer sailing school this week. And, no, this shouldn't conjure up any Henley Regatta image, being funded as it is by the New Deal for Communities (NDC) scheme, which was established by the Labour government since it was elected in 1997. And a great scheme it is too, going solely by how it has had an impact on our own deprived community. Bundles of (useful) information have come through the door since this scheme was established here around 2 years ago, always with the emphasis on how local people can get involved and have a direct say in changing and improving local services and local resources. So, for those who rage against Labour and ask what good has it done, I'll always use the New Deal for Communities scheme as an example of what makes Labour fundamentally different from the other lot. Back to the boy, then, the NDC carry out numerous out of school activities for local children and someone came up with the absolutely fantastic idea of the sailing club. Apart from the fact that it is a lot cheaper than the alternative play scheme options, it's a healthy activity and a great way of occupying a little part of the badly underused Thames. We have this great waterway cutting its way through the most beautiful city in the world, yet its empty of traffic - traffic which is considerably less damaging to our environment than that on the roads. I received a totally unexpected late-night visit from oldest brother last night. He was on his way home to Glasgow from Tokyo and missed his connecting flight at Heathrow. So Reidski puts him up and shares an enjoyable glass of whisky over tales of his hols before departing to bed. Talking of bed...when Hats comes to an end on the turntable and I polish off the last of the Oyster Bay sauvignon blanc, then I'll hit the sack. Not before I briefly mention my trip to the doctors this afternoon, however. My weird swallowing problem is not one that he could handle, so he's making an emergency referral to a throat specialist at the hospital. "Whooppee!" was the cry from 'er indoors when I said jokingly that I would probably have to get my voice box removed.

      Sister Anne demands words. Well, here we go... ...I came across the following while looking for something at work this week. It's a letter taken from a late 1968 edition of the Railway Review, the weekly paper of the National Union of Railwaymen (the predecessor of today's RMT - the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers). The fact that unions at that time had a  weekly  paper in itself fascinated me. But this letter doubly fascinated me. It's a great rant, but one which shows great working class political intellect. And it has great resonance for class politics of our own times. It was headed "This rotten society"    "Sir, - Because the white man is not ostensibly responsible for the present decimation of the Ibo people in the so-called state of Nigeria, which was and still is an artificial body-politic forcibly created by British imperialism, our ‘free’ mass media are waxing eloquent over their suffering and the crying need to put a stop to the fratricidal war. They practically ignore the far worse butchery still being perpetrated on innocent women and kids in Vietnam by the highest paid thugs of the English speaking world and the blatant fascist outrages committed by our kith and kin in Rhodesia on the Ziimbabwe people. At home we, as railwaymen, are still being bossed and upbraided by bourgeois worthies whose outlook on public transport is conditioned by the fact that they do all their overland travelling in chauffeur driven limousines and are the same type who, while cutting the more plebian bus and train services to the bone, applaud in the name of progress the costly Concorde gamble, not, I suspect, because it is going to bring a weekend in New York any nearer for the average worker. Self-styled town planners, snugly ensconced in detached, open-plan residences, laud the advanatge of tower block flats for rehousing the urban poor; ensuring that the distraught young housewives forced to live in them keep the pep pill manufacturers at full blast and help to put extra strain on the under-staffed mental hospitals already brimful with other victims of this neurotic and cut-throat society. Meanwhile, educationalists pontificate on the virtues of comprehensive schools while ensuring that their own offspring attend those exclusive institutions which under the patronage of the old boy network makes certain that regardless of ability, these protected sprigs never want for a cushy number or have to tag on to the dole queue. Not to forget those nutritional know-alls, who having wiped the salmon mayonnaise from their sleek chops, assert that pensioners can be kept comfortably alive on a diet that would emaciate a small pet poodle. At the same time, the ubiquitous food adverts exhort us to believe that British grub is not only best but cheapest – ignoring the fact that it is tasteless and being more stuffed with drugs and preservatives than nourishment, not such a bargain as the nosh tycoons make it out to be. Admitted we still have the biggest collection of ham actors and comic singers under one roof at the Westminster Palace of Varieties, for all the big drum banging, our health service scarcely measures up to that of ‘under-developed’ Cuba and is streets behind that of the ‘totalitarian’ GDR. In line with the Nelson tradition of looking the other way, although our antiquated hospitals admit ever increasing numbers of lung cancer cases caused by the much publicised navy cut fags made from ‘pure’ Virginia tobacco, our professional scaremongers concentrate on the relatively harmless cannabis and the perils of the pill; after all, who of any importance holds shares in ‘Consolidated Marijuana’ and what tax system can squeeze state revenue from straight sex. On the same track, ‘Clean Air’ legislation has spared us the unhealthy habit of burning cheap ordinary coal in favour of the dearer smokeless fuels, so that now instead of taking deep lungfuls of noxious, sulphurous air we inhale the more modern variety well laced with petrol and diesel fumes – unless of course we can afford to live in the highly desirable and expensive garden suburbs advertised in the snob Sunday papers. Now, to cap it all, we are being lectured on the necessity to work harder for less pay in order to pave the way to future prosperity (whose? is never mentioned). This gratuitous advice is delivered by ‘bland friends of the people’ who have never in their parasitical lives regularly clocked on for jobs that are boring, dirty and/or physically strenous; but because the hired hacks of capitalism have done their dirty work so well, most trade unionists seem to regard them still as paragons of integrity and ability – a con trick that must make the shade of Dr Goebbels green with envy. Yours etc, Bill Easter Covent Garden Branch"    If anyone out there has ever heard of Bill Easter, please let me know.
