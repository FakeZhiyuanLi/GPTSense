      I went to my mom's sfriend's son's communion on Sunday and I enjoyed it. Why? Because there was this hot girl called Naomi there, who was real nice. Not b****y like other hot girls. We talked and I asked for her number. And she gave it to me! On Monday, I asked her if she fancied me, and she said yes! Is that awesome or is that awesome! On Tuesday, I saw her again outside my local cinema. I'd been watching The Day After Tomorrow and it turned out she was sitting behind me. Outside the cinema, Naomi asked if I wanted to go round her house. I thought what is this hot girl trying to do to me, seduce me? I went round her house and went in her bedroom. We kissed for about 10 minutes and it was satisfying! Afterwards, I asked her why she fancied me. She said that she likes tanned boys with blonde hair that are extreme. That's me! It's too bad she doesn't go to my school, but she has a mate that goes to my school. Some girl called Sheila in one of the tutor groups. Not interested in that... I didn't manage to get Mario Party 5 on Saturday, but I did manage to get a pre-owned version of Mario Party 4 for cheap in Gamestation. I'm happy with Mario Party 4 a the moment. But when I finish it, I'm going back to Gamestation to trade Mario Party 4 for Mario Party 5. Today, Naomi asked if she could come round my house. I let her, and we kissed in my bedroom for about 15 minutes-ish. Enjoyed it a lot! Now she's gone home for dinner and I'm on the computer. But one thing that Naomi doesn't know is that before she came round, I was on MSN and I was talking to my mate Dean. I had the webcam switched on and when Naomi was there, I turned off the Display Moniter but not the computer itself. I had totally forgot about the webcam and Dean watched all of the kissing. Now I've turned off MSN without talking to Dean. So I hope nothing happens at school, because if something does, Dean is gonna egt a beating! Later days...

      Yesterday at the Youth Club was bad. 3 Girls decided to beat the s*** out of me. In defense I just hit them back, but not hard. A guy wouldn't punch a girl and make sure that it hurt would he, unless he was like Trevor off Eastenders. One of the girls was leading them on but she wasn't punching me, so i decided to kick her and try to punch her in the face, but it didn't hurt her. Them three have been nasty to me at school, but the girl that was leading them on has been saying rascist comments about me which is definatly out of order. I'm Italian, and she keeps saying that I don't belong in the U.K I should butt off back to Italy, what's my purpose of being here. Now is that rascist or not. My mum, father and some of my schoolteachers do think it's rascist. That girl's too dumb to tell if she's being rascist or not. I told my tutor cause I felt that she couldn't get away with this, cause there are some Soanish guys in my school who she doesn't like and the same thing could happen to them! 2 days later my form tutor called her parents in and they started talking about what to do with her. I don't know what else happened but I could tell she got away with it. I'm not a grass but with her, being a grass is nessecary cause she will not get away with this. What a b****! I decided to walk away from them and tell the local staffwoman that was present, but she just told us both to stop it. Every a guy and a girl start making trouble against each other, that staffwoman just tells them both to stop it, but when the guy walks away she goes to the girls and says are you ok? She did the same thing in my case too! So I decided to play football, that's soccer for you americans. it turned out better the rest of the night cause one of the girls tripped over a drainpipe and broke her nose. I was laughing my head off cause she deserved it, she gave me a bruise!! I played on the Gamecube in the Club and played Mario Party 5 and chatted on about the girls. Turned out that the three girls were p***ing them off as well, and one of them was one of the girls younger brother! I got on my skateboard after finishing a game of Mario Party 5 and skated home. It was 10.00pm when I got home and both of my brother's were sleeping. So I decided to watch all the Rocky Movies, I was bored.When I finished watching them all, it was 6.30am and I hadn't even got any sleep. So I decided to go to sleep. Now it's 10.44 and I'm writing this all in my blog, tired! I'm gonna go to my local shopping centre to buy Slipknot's new album. I've heard it's good, plus I'll buy White Stripe's Elephant cause I never bought that album even though I had the money I always bought something else. But I'll buy it today, and also Mario Party 5 cause after playing it at the club a few times I wanted it for home. So I'm gonna post this and later I'll be going out to buy it :D

      Seeing as everyone on Habbo Forum has started a blog, I thought I'd start one as it seems interesting. Today I had Humanities in the morning and my teacher kept spitting in people's faces when she talked, luckily I was at the back. I got in trouble from her, cos I was doodling in my book a picture of an angel. One that was really angelic. I have that picture in my homework diary, cause it seems special to me. I don't really think of it as a doodle, more like a work of art. Can't scan it in cause my scanner's broken, what a drag! Then I had English and watched Frankenstein. It featured the proper story of Frankenstein, not the green monster one. I hate the fact about people calling the monster Frankenstein, when really it was his creator who name was Frankenstein. As soon as the bell rang, I was straight out of there, but I knocked a couple of class textbooks and couldn't be bothered to pick them up. Got told off for that cause I walked off ignoring me teacher. At morning break I found out that one of my mates, Frank had a haircut. I liked his hair when it was really long, but now he had it cut like one of the Beatles. What a drag! I'm gonna grow it like that, definately. Not the Beatle styled hair, but the long hair. Like Kurt Cobain. And even though I'm 13, I'm shaving. I'm growing a gotee like Kurt Cobain, man he rocks! When break was finished, I went to my IT Class, for you Americans, that's Computers. I couldn't be bothered to start learning touch-type so I went on www.rathergood.co.uk to play a Sonic The Hedgehog flash game, which resembled to a improved version of Sonic Advance. Then I had Science when IT finished. That's when I got in big trouble! In my Chemistry Experiment, I had to put an Universal Indicator in different liquids like shampoo to find out their pH and if they were acid or alkali and how weak/strong they were. My lab partner who's a fat greasy slimeball who enjoys sitting i na chair and laugh like a mouse at passer-by's was holding the test tube full of yogurt. I got the indicator and squeezed it into the tube, then I turned round to shout abuse at the class idiot who was currently blabbing on to Chris, a thickhead. The indicator started dripping on my lab partner's hand and he didn't even notice it until he felt loads of burning. Then I realised that I wasn't holding an Universal Indicator but I was holding an Acid! My lab partner suffered severe burns on his hand and I had detention on every Wednesday lunchtime for a month, and I'm grounded upstairs with my darling computer. Anyway, at lunchtime the school canteen was closed, so everyone sat outside chatting, well the girls did... Most girls sat in the basketball court outside. As it happens, I was playing basketball with my mates and telling them about what happened in Science, when I decided to throw the ball behind me. It hit the Headmaster/Principal. How bad. Mega Bad. I got a yellow slip delivered to my form tutor. let me explain, when something good/bad happens, slips are sometimes delivered to my tutor. The best are Orange slips which are delivered for good reasons. Blue slips are delivered for improvement on things like behaviour and work, I only got one of them last year >:D. Yellow slips are for bad incidents and Red slips are for really bad things. I got 1 more yellow slip for burning my partner's hand muwahahaha. After lunchtime, I had maths with this teacher who picks on pupils who aren't looking at the board, just staring into some random item or doodling. I was one of them, she asked me what was the squeare root of 64. i know it was 8 but I just said Dunno cause I couldn't be bothered to answer the question. The teacher said "Max, if you keep saying dunno any more in all my maths lessons with you, you will be given detention". How dumb is that? Mega dumb! After that I had D.T my last lesson of the day. I did cooking and I made some butter scones. Then I left all my cooking utensils out and I made some idiot clear it up. When I went out of chool, I ate up all my 6 scones and then I got out my skateboard and started skating home. The road my school is on has a very steep slope. Riding a bike on it is realy dangerous, skateboarding and rollerskating too, but skateboarding on it is like hellishly extreme! I skated down shouting hell yeah, this is quick! My mates saw me skating down there and shouted Go max go! I felt cool, as if I was Tony Hawk. As I was skating down, a group of girls were blocking my way. I shouted move out of the f***ing way you b****es but they shouted Whatever without even looking behind them. So I continued skating down and knocked one of them over. Serves them right, look before you make a decision... Now I'm here typing my first entry to my extra-fantiscular cool...sculer blog! I'll be going out to my local Youth Club tonight to mingle with a group of hot girls! Proper Bo I tell thee! I'm listening to a big collection of Red Hot Chili Peppers albums on Winamp including By The Way, One Hot Minute, Mother's Milk and Californication. Red Hot Chili Peppers are my favourite, period. Now I'm gonna post my entry, how fantasticular!
